{"text":"Guru Palace has so many highlights that it's hard to pick just a few.

The lunchtime buffet provides the opportunity to mix dishes, and I'm a huge fan of both their Palak Paneer and Daal, so a lunch trip is always my first choice (even though lunchtime wait service is on the slower side).

Their dinner menu is fairly basic, but I've never had a dish that I disliked.  And while I prefer the veg dishes the most, the Lamb Vindaloo is also very very good."}
{"text":"Having frequented the owners (or owners family) other establishment (Indian Delhi Palace), I was super excited when this placed opened (a while back, but just getting around to a review) as it's a mile from my house.

In my opinion, nothing is better hangover/post drinking food than an Indian Buffet.  The heavy food sops up all the previous nights sins and leaves you satisfactorily sleepy and ready for a nap to get you ready for that nights activities.

Being Indian, the quality of food really does matter to me...not just the hangover cure aspects of it.  This place is solid.  I consider the Indian Dehli Palace the best in the valley, and this place comes in a close second.  Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chana Masala (my two faves) are perfect.  I do prefer my food to be a little more spicy but I understand they're trying to cater to all palates, so adding some of the spicy chutneys they offer does the trick just fine.  Speaking of the chutney, they offer a nice assortment of accoutrements with the buffet.  We have been here a couple of times for dinner and have enjoyed pretty much everything we ordered off the menu...my parents are vegetarian and all the veggie dishes are awesome.  The ONLY thing I think could be a little better is the naan.  It's good, but Indian Dehli Palace has it beat in that respect.  Everything else is similar in flavor.

The atmosphere is the best I've witnessed in an AZ Indian restaurant.  Nicely decorated and they even have special tables where you can sit on the floor ''Indian'' style.  Pretty fun for a date.

The service can be a little slow when they are moderately full, but that's only an issue when you're there for dinner.  Doesn't really matter for the buffet.

All in all, always a great experience here."}
{"text":"After another Indian place in the area closed down several months ago, this has become our go-to place for dates.  We've not tested the menu extensively, but the chicken dishes we've tried (tikka masala, chicken tikka, and tandoori chicken) have all been delicious, though the serving size on the tikka masala always seems a bit on the small side given the price and how much chicken is included with other dishes.  We've always found the service to be decent, though not stellar, and the staff friendly and helpful.  The ambiance is also just average, but the food keeps us going back.  It is not a 5-star place, but I have no problems giving it 4 stars and recommending it others."}
{"text":"I was referred here by my folks, who live in Far East Mesa and insist this is the best Indian food in the valley, though their reluctance to drive very far lead me to believe they were skewed by the proximity to their place.  But I ended up really enjoying it.

Their appetizers are all really reasonably priced, and sometimes if your on a snack binge or just want some variety for lunch, I feel like that's a good place to start.  Their full bar and beer selection can make it fun to pair up a few different items.

My friend and I had the Lamb - something ( I can't remember the name, but it was a red curry like dish) and the Chicken Saag.  The Lamb was the winner, but the chicken was also good.

At dinner, rice and naan are not included, so to get all the pieces of a meal you need to play a little more for ala carte.  But the Garlic Naan was worth it ... it wafts in your face and ruins other subtle smells, but it's Indian Food, so don't expect many.  Without alcoholic drinks, we had a dinner for 2 for 44 dollars.  And the service was on top of everything ... They had our water refilled quickly (we went a little too spicy) and our soft drinks topped off as needed.  Really friendly and willing to make sure you had a good experience."}
{"text":"I too disagree with Phil G -- a guy who is, apparently, no-frills and quite concerned with money (perhaps 'cheap' comes to mind).  While I agree it's not your typical very-inexpensive Indian food buffet, I do feel the extra couple of bucks is worth it for:

a) consistently fresh, great quality food
b) a clean/stylish restaurant
c) an Indian restaurant with a full bar

I've been to India -- and while I'd never claim this makes me any sort of food expert, I will say that while I was there I ate twice at a restaurant named Bukhara -- considered by many to be the greatest Indian restaurant in the world.  So, if nothing else, I have the luck of knowing what the best Indian cuisine tastes like (mind-blowing, by the way).  I've also recently eaten in an Indian restaurant in Tempe where I found a 2 inch long metal shaving in my food and the food tasted days old.  So, let's say I rank the place in Tempe a 3 out of 10 and I rank the place in Delhi a 10 out of 10.  Guru Palace ranks an 8.  Pretty damned good for Mesa, AZ -- or anywhere else for that matter.

As for the friendliness....well, maybe they're not trying to be your best buddy from the day they meet you like they do at, for example, TGI Fridays.....but then, um, well.....they're from India -- a place where folks are much more reserved than Americans.  The people at the restaurant are quite pleasant -- calm and polite.  What more do you want from a server?

Anyway, I highly encourage everyone to give Guru Palace a try.  They have an awesome lunch buffet and a great dinner menu, too."}
{"text":"Guru Palace is our favorite Indian restaurant, equal to or better than most Indian restaurants in New York City and London. This advice is from a former New Yorker who grew up in an Indian neighborhood. And we routinely cook Indian food at home! The food and service is consistently excellent. We regularly order the vindaloo, achari, saag, and mixed grill dishes. It's totally worth it. Someone mentioned the tikka masala and that too is consistently perfect.The decor in the restaurant is lovely but we believe the restaurant could draw larger crowds with better lighting. Prices match the quality of the cuisine, so it's worth it."}
{"text":"I was disappointed, the food is just too bland!

My husband and I ordered a variety of food to get an idea of there food spectrum: Garlic Chicken Kabob, Lamb Vindaloo, Palak Paneer, Garlic Naan, Gulab Jamun, and Rass Malai.

The only positives I saw was that the meat was cooked well...that's it! The sauces for each dish lacked flavor and spice. My husband even requested Indian spicy and it wasn't even spicy...it tasted like a mild. The Garlic Naan was decent.

At this point we were going to give it a 3...barely! Then the desserts came...

The gulab jamun was firm and frozen and it seemed like they added extra butter/ghee to the syrup. The Rass Malai was too thick and creamy, it seemly like it was soaked in heavy cream, which messed up the texture of the paneer. And after we saw the bill, their score plummeted to 2. 

It was not worth it. So many of my classmates have gushed about how great the food is, but I realized, they probably dont know any better. I grew up near Little India around LA where good Indian food was no hard to find, so I could just be spoiled."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times now and have never had a bad experience. The food is incredible and with such a large selection of dishes it's the  perfect place to come with a large group. Some of my favorites: Lamb Vindallo, Chicken Masala, Samosas, Tikka Masala, Mango Lassi, Indian Tea (Chai). Oh and who could forget the Garlic Naan - Mmmm! 

It's no wonder Guru Palace is always busy ! I'll be back soon and can't wait to try some of the vegetarian dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten the lunch buffet at Guru Palace twice and we are big fans!  There is an excellent variety of tasty foods, including meat dishes and desserts.   The buffet is always clean and well stocked.  We particularly like the Pani Puri for starters, the garlic nan, and I love the mango lassi. The ambiance is good, on the darker side with neat lighting on the ceiling, heavy curtains, and current Indian music playing. There is a big painting of the Taj Mahal directly behind the buffet.  Service is great, and we've noticed a broad range of clientele.

On our last visit, I used a $2 off buffet coupon (received it in a mailer).  What a deal!

My husband and I eat a lot of Indian food at home and in different restaurants around the valley.  Guru Palace offers the best buffet that we've tried yet."}
{"text":"I never used to care for Indian food until my friend kept telling me about this place's lunch buffet, and I finally went. Now, I crave this place! 
For about $10, you get an 'all you can eat' lunch buffet. It allows you to try a lot of different dishes. There is a good variety of classic Indian dishes, including Indian desserts, mango yogurt drink, etc. They only have the buffet in the daytime, until about 4pm. 
I have never had dinner here, but I can say that the lunch buffet is worth the price, and the food is SO YUMMY!! From someone who never ate Indian food, I have been there probably 10 times since I went there the first time a few months ago."}
{"text":"I like this place for lunch. I haven't been there for dinner. I mostly like this place because they serve fresh fruit with their buffet. I would have to say they are on the mild side as far as the herbs/ spices are concerned but it's pretty good.  They have a large selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian items. They also have a deboned white fish dish that was new to me and pretty yummy. The service is always excellent. 
I used the 15% off check in. They told me that it expired in 2013 but the expiration date is not on the front page. It's on the second screen.  
The place doesn't seem as dark as it used to. I think it's the blinds. They used to have dark curtains, if my memory serves me right.  I like that it's brighter.
The AC is out so they had a portable one inside. It was a bit warm but not too bad. Not noisy either. I was not seated in the area the unit was blowing."}
{"text":"I am not Indian, but I have had Indian food all around the world, including in India. This was the most boring Indian food ever. I didn't even know Indian food could be boring. Also, I got food poisoning from their Shrimp Koorma. Additional issues: the water was room temperature--very odd. And the service was also lukewarm. The place is overpriced. I will say the $8 Indian beer, though absurdly expensive, was cold and good. I do not know how this restaurant could get good ratings. Extremely disappointing, and none of us would ever go back."}
{"text":"To preface this review, I am a food snob. I have eaten at some of the top restaurants in the country. So I'm not being overly nice or naive in my review. There was no odor to the restaurant, the service was great and I loved the food. In the top three Indian meals I have had. I have eaten here multiple times and the experience has been consistent each time. The tikka masala, karahi and naan are very good. Ignore the hateful reviews and give it a try. This place and the people are great."}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation by a friend who had come during their lunch menu buffet.  We came at dinner time.
Not a lot of people but this is likely due to their location which is located at a strip mall next to Trader Joe's and tucked behind a bank.
The food was quite good.  Garlic Naan was hot and flavorful, Roti bread was good.  The rice was excellent but at 3 to 4 dollars a bowlful quite expensive a la carte.  Chicken Tikki Masala was very good.  Lamb was done very well.  All sauces were done excellently and had wonderful flavor.  Having eaten at other Indian places in Boston, Santa Monica, and Fremont Ca (the Bombay Palace).  I've had very authentic Indian food and this place rates highly.  
The cons are that being Indian food tends be be labor intensive, the prices are quite high.  
Service was attentive and excellent.  Decor was subdued and lighting was low and intimate.  
I would have given 4 stars only if they had not priced so high on what would be staples (rice and Naan)."}
{"text":"We had the lunch buffet today and it was delicious. The restaurant was sweltering, probably in the mid to high eighties when we entered. We asked them to please turn the air conditioning on. We were seated and said hello to a male server who did not acknowledge or answer. We got glasses of water and a basket of garlic naan and there was no service after that. That server, he may be a manager, never came near our table again until we had finished when he came by and threw the bill on the table and never said a word. We wanted some more naan and the male server had baskets that he was giving to other patrons but never offered to us. I was even waving to him that we would like some more naan but we never got any. I know the owners of this restaurant. The food servers do not get to keep tips. The tips are rung up and put in the cash register, and the servers are simply paid a higher hourly wage. This is not a good system for good customer service. We will give Guru Palace a little break for the rest of the summer and go back in the fall when hopefully this food server has moved on to some other job.  The food is delicious but I am not going to be treated like a piece of dirt by a surly busboy/waiter."}
{"text":"Good food, but not so good service. It wasn't busy, but took an unreasonable amount of time to get the food. Naan bread was a bit pricey at 2.50 for garlic for two pieces. They also charge extra for an additional bowl of rice, even though we ordered two entrees and only received one bowl of rice. Good food, but don't know if it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I had the buffet during lunch time on a Saturday.  The food here is okay... no horrible but nothing outstanding either.  I was impressed with the spaciousness of the dining room.  As I type this review, I realize maybe I am just biased when it comes to Indian food.  So try it and be your own judge..."}
{"text":"GREAT $10 LUNCH BUFFET
a great way to try a bunch of different cultural foods to see what you like
You can even try the goat masala!
great curry, masala, aloo beans, daal, rice, naan
great experience!"}
{"text":"Used yelp! deal and took myself out, after hearing great things. All true. Service, atmosphere, and (most importantly) the food were amazing! Mixed grill, garlic n
aan, and raita ftw!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  5 stars is PERFECT and I've yet to eat anywhere that makes me dream of it constantly :-).

But for Indian food on the east valley, this is really, really good.  The staff is friendly and authentic.  The lunch buffet is plentiful with your favorites of Tikka Masala, curry, pakora, palak paneer, naan, rice, etc.  All really, really good stuff -- and for all-you-can-eat, the price is absolutely right!

Also a good place for dinner with friends.  The dinner portions for friend sharing are a bit small (i.e., if you are in a group of 8 and everyone wants tikka masala -- you may want to order 3).  That's my only complaint though and they don't advertise to be family style anyway.

It's really good and if you live in the east valley and like Indian food, check it out!"}
{"text":"The best Indian food in the valley! We found out about it while visiting an Indian restaurant in Flagstaff, the server there recommend Guru Palace. We drive 15 miles to eat there and drive by a couple other Indian restaurants on the way. Matilda is generally our server, she is very personable."}
{"text":"Whenever I have a head cold I run out for Indian food.  It opens up the sinuses and is very comforting.  I stumbled across the Guru Palace after a hair appointment and was delighted.  Great atmosphere, polite, and friendly staff, and excellent food.  I ordered the Chicken Vindaloo, the Vegetable Biryani, and the Bengan Bhartha, all to go.  It was all I ate for the next three days.  It was yummy, with the perfect amount of spice and texture that I was craving.  The manager (owner?) was helpful in suggesting dishes which would suit my tastes and needs and made me feel very comfortable during my wait.  I highly recommend Guru Palace for take out or eating at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place. The lunch buffet is ok. It's not spicy and there isn't much selection. Order from the menu instead. Guru palace has GREAT Indian food and good service. I have gone to dozens of Indian food places across Arizona and have been disappointed with most of them if not outraged with what they called Indian food.  I don't know why there are people out there who rated this place so low clearly they do not know indian food (I grew up on Indian food) or  are crazy not to trust the experts who gave this place MULTIPLE AWARDS for best Indian food in AZ. And if that doesn't convince you of the quality of the food here, just look around to see who the regulars are."}
{"text":"The Guru Pitka woud eat at this Guru Palace.  They have an excellent Lunch buffett with choice of plain or garlic nan.  Good service.  Family owned.  Very Authentic.  Make sure you check the New Times for Coupons.  I think it's normally 8.99 but with coupon it's 5.99/pp.  Try a taste of everything.  Bring your friends for something different for lunch.  You can only eat so many burgers and fries.  

Food was Hot.  Good quality.  Restaurant was clean.  Attentive service.  I highly reccomend."}
{"text":"The curry, chicken , shrimp and lamb were very good.The tikka masala is very good as the guy recommended. Have not tried the buffet, but the dinner menu is quite good. You can choose from mild to hot., we chose mostly mild and it was good for me. My visitors from California also liked it very much and said it is better than all the Indian they tried in South and Northern Cal.
They have discount coupons , take advantage of them."}
{"text":"We always go there for lunch and it's always good, don't go there if you want a frendly server because I think they don't care of this stuff. We always go back just for the food and not for the costumers service.."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our first date here an continue to go every chance we get.  I love their food and the service is great."}
{"text":"This little strip mall Indian restaurant gets a bonus point for being so beautiful inside.  Very contemporary with traditional flair.  It gets minus one point beacuse it was hot.  Was thA/C broken or was the food's spicey nature taking advantage of me?  It was slightly unpleasant but I will get over it.  The Guru Palace get's 3 solid stars on it's very friendly helpful service and it's wonderful food.  I have only dined here twice and it was consitantly good.
This time from the $8.99 buffett I tried the Palaak Paneer which is excellent. I of course had a piece of the Tandoori Chicken (thigh piece, I think.  I have a thing for meat on the bone-don't care for it.  That's  why I prefer Chicken Tikka.)  It was good but not as good as the Chicken Marsala.  Pungent and very flavorful. The rice was a differnt form today-not basmati which I prefer.  There was a new dish I did not recognize called Mushroom Matar (?).  It was delicious with bits of onion and peas in a tangy light gravy of sort.  I also enjoy the garlic naan.  No papdum was offerred this time.  I did enjoy a split of champagne which compliments the delightful spicey flavors without filling you up.
I was so warm from the lack of a/c and hot spicy achaar chutney (my favorite) that I was melting like the wicked witch at my table. 
The service was very friendly and I don't know how anyone could call this expensive.  I thought it was downright cheap!  $3.99 for champagne plus two full plates of great food.  It is a great place to stop in for reliable food, kind staff and beutiful dining room."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is always consistent and delicious. The staff is friendly and attenttive. I would definitely recommend Guru Palace. Please keep up the good work. And thank you for having clean bathrooms. It is all ways a tell-tell how clean a kitchen will be."}
{"text":"They had stale food in buffet. Looked like they forgot to refrigerate leftovers from the night before"}
{"text":"Guru Palace is simply fantastic.  We have eaten there in the evenings, both as a couple on date night and as a family.  The best word for the atmosphere is inviting:  it is a relaxing, pleasant, warm place to eat.  It is a soothing place to sit after a stressful day.  However,  the decor is also wonderfully filled with murals in warm colors that let our little girls pretend they are in a palace.  

The food is addicting it is so delicious.  I am absolutely stuck on the Chicken Khorma and Lamb Saag and can't get past them.  The staff is very helpful with recommendations.  I do not handle spicy-hot well (very wimpy), so we order our food mild to share and they bring my husband a separate bowl of spice so he can heat his up.

Highly recommend Guru Palace."}
{"text":"Today we had lunch with 50 other seniors. Usually, my wife is very critical of buffet lunch, but she was very pleased with their dishes.  Good service, plenty of food verity and good desert."}
{"text":"Absolutely useless service. Literally it was like they forgot we were there. The place was nearly empty yet they found a way to totally neglect us. It was infuriating. We will never come back. The food was good though."}
{"text":"In just one visit we were able to sample a wide variety of great Indian cuisine. The Chicken Tikka Masala is incredibly smooth. The Chicken Biryani is great for anyone who is not fond of spicier dishes. The Lamb Vindaloo is fantastic and the perfect amount of spice for the dish. For dessert we sampled the Gulab Jamun which is absolutely delightful. The service was excellent with plenty of beverage refill offers and check ins from the staff."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  And I like that you can choose the spice level - from  1 to 10.  This is now our favorite restaurant for Indian Food!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 6 and we sat on the floor - so fun. Staff was super friendly and accommodating. They overheard is talking about upcoming birthdays in the group and unexpectedly brought out ice cream with a candle! Such a nice gesture. Veggie samosas were great and so was the chana masala. Chicken tikka masala was really good but not the best I've ever had. I will be back and recommend this place."}
{"text":"Extremely shocking experience to the overall rating that is give to this resturant. Came in for buffet on Saturday evening, starters were stale, roti wasn't any closer to wht u would imagine for a Panjabi resturant..They are supposed to be the king of rotis...  Being an Indian  most of the veg and non- veg curry didn't taste for me any closer to what they are claimed to be. Meat tasted so stale. Then the disastrous deserts. Frankly over rated or may be its lost it's charm. NO GO!!"}
{"text":"I came with my foodie friends for the lunch buffet. I tried just about everything and ended up eating far more than I should have.

Most dishes were mildly flavored; I prefer more \"kick\" to my curry, and was slightly disappointed. My favorites were the creamed spinach and cauliflower and potato curry; they offered the best combination of flavor and texture. The spinach had chunks of soft cheese, adding just the right balance of flavor and texture to the dish. 

The service is friendly and efficient. I'll come back; it's a great value for lunch and the food is good. I recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been going to Guru Palace since they opened about 6 years or so ago.  I have been to all the Indian restaurants in the valley and I have to say every time I try out a new one I think why didn't I just go to Guru in the first place! They are consistently good, the food is fresh and the service is great."}
{"text":"Had chicken biriyani, mutter paneer (pea dish) and veggie pakora. All were excellent as was the service. My favorite Indian place to eat thus far."}
{"text":"All I wanted was a take away...when they did eventually answer the phone I was told, \"One minute while I get a pen\" I hung up after 5. 

I order and then go to collect it. I have learned over the years to check the contents and behold, it was wrong. They argued that my order was correct...I eventually got what I wanted, but I had to wait 15 minutes..And then the food was only mediocre..."}
{"text":"First of all let say that this restaurant pays a company to give them good reviews...the reason I know this is bc the owners daughter goes to school with me and told me about the company. 
We walked in this place around 5ish thinking it will be fresh dinner. This place was completely empty. The hostess sat us way in the back of this filthy place. She brought us warm water with no ice In it and cups were dirty. We looked at the menu and decided to get the spinach samosas which I love! Theses samosas were grossed and tasted like they were frozen in the freezer for a while, it didn't have the cheese or the nuts in which the menu claimed it did. I ordered the dinner platter that came with few different meats chicken, lamb, kabob all DISGUSTING! There was more caramelized onions on the platter than anything else. The rice was super cold...it looked like prison food served in metal bowls. I love Indian food but this place grossed me out. My husband ordered couple things from the menu his was even worse. Everything tasted the same. I gotta say though the only good thing was their Nan, bc it was freshly made. Crapy service with crapy food! I told the server I didn't like my food but she didn't seem to give a damn. Never again am I going to this place to eat even if it was for free."}
{"text":"Very good ambience. You have to option of sitting down on mats (no chairs) in traditional Indian style if you like it. The food was pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"A favorite restaurant for the past 4 years. We eat in and we take out. Probably once a month. (Dinner only) 

GREAT Chicken Tikka Masala 
AMAZING Shrimp Korma 
DELISH lentils (I can't remember what they call it.)

The Samosas have a kick to them. 

The nan. Is. The. Best. 

Enjoy! I always do!"}
{"text":"Had the buffet today and it was quite good. The curry was a bit mild but then it IS a buffet. The server assured me that the curry from the menu is available in differing heat levels and the proceeded to bring me a small copper pot fill with freshly made chili paste. That did the trick!

It is on a par with other Indian buffets in town but some of the offerings were standouts, the goat masala amoung them. The Naan was very good, toothful and with lots of garlic.

Service was pleasent, despite what some reviewers have said, and we were never wanting for anything. And not a single television to be seen! (This last is a major plus in my book.)

Overall I think you'll find the buffet at Guru Palace very enjoyable and you will be back again and again."}
{"text":"We love this place and go often for a wide variety of Indian foods offered on their buffet. Generally I avoid buffets like the plague but this is an exception. From the chicken tikka masala to the saag paneer,  tandoori chicken, curried mutton,  and creative vegetarian options...it is Love at first bite. The naan is fresh and delicious. I like the sauces they have available and the lassi always tastes just right- not too sweet. 

I am dinging a star because it is very very dark in there during the day. This concerns me, what is being hidden?  It doesn't create much of an ambiance. It is literally difficult to see your food. Secondly I think the service is subpar. People pile their used plates up and they don't seem to get bussed away. A water refill would be nice without having to ask as the food is spicy. For a place where most diners have the buffet during the day, it doens't seem there is that much that the servers need to do. Let a little light in the restaurant  and add a bus person, and the fifth star is yours!

Done deal!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for Curry and other Indian food. 
Service is great and people are friendly. For take away it is excellent."}
{"text":"Good food, lots of variety, both meat and veggies. Fast service. Naan comes fresh. We went for lunch on MLK day."}
{"text":"Naan.  You better nail it if you're an Indian food establishment and this place did.  They also nailed the Chicken Tikki Masala.  I'm a fan of this place and it's by total accident I ended up here.  I would normally write more but it's 5 in the morning and I'm drinking.  Anywho, worth going to if you stumble across it like I did."}
{"text":"The owner is very rude and the food is poor quality. Don't go there worse experience ever"}
{"text":"Wow!  So impressed!  Just happened to try the buffet since I was in the neighborhood, and I think it's the best indian buffet I've ever had!  Everything was fresh and tasty, I can't remember having better garlic naan, and the chai was fabulous.  (Not cheap and watered down like a lot of places.)

Go go go to the buffet and enjoy!  All for $8.99 are you kidding me?"}
{"text":"Love this place. Tasty and a good variety. I have only tried their lunch buffet. Under $10 including tax. Check it out. It's right next to Starbucks off Baseline and Gilbert."}
{"text":"I just ordered from this place for lunch and it was terrible. The chicken tikka masala had more onions than chicken. I couldn't even finish it. The samosas were loaded with salt. Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"This was our last option of eating dinner to end the night on a Sunday. Our first option was a thai place which we love to go a lot because it's very quiet and we're the only people in there, but we miss the information regarding that they closed on sundays so with disappointment we decided to try out this place.

If you read my review on Indian Oven, this would be the second time I have eaten indian food and that was with the Guru Palace.

I was very hesitant to try this place because the parking lot was empty and it looked really closed but on their hours it said they were closed till 10pm which i was happy to see. As we pulled up and parked, we walked in and waited for a few seconds then we were seated a bit in the back near the empty buffet.

The place was really spacious, indian paintings on the walls and really nice indian theme type lights and decorations. In comparison to the Indian oven, that place is a bit  condensed and not so much space.

Our male waiter was very new at this and he was ethnically indian so we were fine with that and having an understanding of what it is like to be working as a busser/food server for the first time I brushed it off.

I was excited looking over the menu and different categories of foods they served. I wasn't sure if they also did an \"all you can eat\" buffet since there was an empty buffet next to us. Indian Oven does not have a food menu item because it is more of a buffet than a regular restaurant.

My boyfriend decided to go with the \"complete dinner\" in which he chose the tandori dinner. i know it comes with an appetizer and main course as well as a drink and desert. 

I figured I would go with the non vegetarion complete dinner since he was going for one. That way we would share and taste each other's meals and have an opinion of the food.

When we ordered our food, the waiter wasn't sure what we were talking about and looked confused. He had to look a the menu to see where we were pointing and then did a few gestures and nods. I was worried and unsure if he understood what we were saying. Language barrier is a problem here but what is really an issue is why was he working alone and there should have been someone who has worked here longer and been with him so that other person would have an idea of what we wanted.

As he left, we chatted for a bit and he comes back with something that looks like taco shells and a sauce. I was confused and thought it would be naan but surely I was a bit disappointed. They looked like taco shells but the taste and texture was completely different. It tasted like sesame seeds or maybe it was chips. The sauce itself was spicy hummus. I am not sure if everyone else who has been here before been served this but I was surprised.

  - 15 minutes later. Our new waiter comes back with two small dishes and puts them on my side of the table. My boyfriend looks at it and I thought \"oh it must be appetizer for my dinner\" but it didn't make sense as to why they didn't bring out my bf's appetizer as well. We shrugged and continued to talk as I tried a bit of each one which tasted pretty good.

-5 more minutes later the waiter comes out with my boyfriend's main course and after that we had the rest of our food which came in 5-10 minute intervals and he had his drink and I didn't get mine on top of that I was very thirsty since I drank all of my water. 

It was not good for this new male waiter to not notice when I did not have water in my cup and did not receive my drink that I ordered. I saw him walking around and seat a party of 3 people that were sitting right across from us. 

I had to flag an older women who looked like the wife of the owner and I might have to guess the owner was ethnically indian with a purple turban on his head wearing a purple stripped polo shirt eating at the bar.

I asked her that i needed water and I did not receive my drink that i ordered and expressed my concerns that only half of our food was here and we might be missing the other half. She didn't understand what we were talking about and was confused.

I got my drink but I ordered a coffee not tea but i let that go.

I tried to reason with my boyfriend and making him understand that our waiter is new and they didn't have someone more professional and fluent in speaking english and in their native tongue to be with this waiter tonight.

I must admit the food is good but customer service on a sunday night between the hours of 7-9 is very poorly done.

We got our check and my boyfriend didn't tip them because of the mix up - he also wrote that we didn't get the other half of our food along with a 0$ for a tip. Then we left.

Indian oven is much better because you can self serve what you want to eat for your dinner but if you prefer to have it served to you from the menu - I'd think twice on that.

Not sure if we'll come back but hey this was a sunday night and maybe if we come back on a different day and time it might be better."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've had Indian food all over the world in different cities (sadly not India yet) and this place checks out! I've been here many times, and every time it's like heaven! The staff is always polite, courteous, and making sure you have everything you need. The food is so good! It's hard to go wrong with Indian cuisine, but this place is for sure my favorite in the area. They make my favorite dish exactly how I like it, even though it's not on the menu. It's right next to my grocery store too, so a convenient location for me."}
{"text":"We found this place here on Yelp. It was date night and my hubby is a recent vegetarian. I wanted to take him somewhere he had choices. It was excellent! I had chicken tikka masala that I loved. The garlic naan is a must! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"2 words...

GARLIC NAN!

Enough said!  

The wife and I went for lunch...buffet was good.  Had a lot of stuff for her too.  Garlic Nan was made fresh and it was YUMMY!"}
{"text":"I am some Indian Roots and I have to admit this place ROCKS- amazing food.  Its darn close to my moms cooking and my mom is really good since she inherited recipes from 4ooyrs of Family secrets.....   A++++++++++++"}
{"text":"We used a groupon to try this incredible Indian joint.  The staff was very knowledgeable friendly and attentive.  A nice variety of vegan options to choose from.  The mushroom pakora was an instant favorite and the aloo gobhi was some of the best cauliflower I have ever tasted. My daughter and I both tried the hot chai tea and it was authentic and delicious.  We both left full and happy but without a heavy feeling.  I'm so glad we finally tried this place.  We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love the Guru Palace, the lunch buffet is amazing, everything they have is so delicious, I've taken friends and family there and they all love it! my only problem is that I can't stop eating, I usually have 2nds, 3rds sometimes a fourth plate until I'm too full to move"}
{"text":"Um, the reviews saying this place is awesome are really confusing to me, and not at all my experience. Many \"unrecommended reviews\" sound more reliable. 

First off, what really disgusted me was the \"upkeep\" of the buffet. The rice tray when I came in that afternoon was empty except for the hard crusty layer stuck to the pan. I thought maybe they cooked it in the pan until they came out dumping new rice on top from a skillet. I had the benefit of the doubt that they just do it for the rice, but nope. They come out with a skillet of whatever sauces/dishes and dump it right into the same pan thats been sitting there partially cooling and reheating for however many hours. That would be the definition of how to grow bacteria. Even better you can enjoy the sound of the \"glug, glug, glug\" from your table. At least take the tray in the back and do that out of sight, where I can assume your serving me something fresh and unlikely to upset my stomach. It makes me wonder what they behind the doors. Do they Saran wrap the same pans and leftovers overnight? Seriously when are they changed? Are they low on pans? Are they trying to be clean? Would this be one of those restaurant disaster shows that I assume are dramatized for ratings? 

The flavor of the food itself was stale but okay. I probably wouldn't remember the place save for what I mentioned above. The naan was very good, seemed fresh. The service was okay. I think it was pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service-- you can see and taste the commitment to quality.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal"}
{"text":"I ordered Guru palace through UBER eats and it was a great experience.  The food was hot and delicious.  Delivered with urgency .  The cauliflower, basmati rice and soup were so delectable. A great vegetation menu."}
{"text":"Best chicken tikka masala!  I have been on the prowl for the best around the area and this tops them.  I'm always disappointed in other places.  Even though Guru Palace is kind of far from me, I will drive the extra distance to go to their buffet to have chicken tikka masala, rice, garlic naan, mango lassi...  

I have taken my friends here and they love it too.  They had never tried Indian food and they agree with me that my favorite dish is delicious there.  In fact, one came into town and on her \"to-do\" list was eating lunch there."}
{"text":"Food was ok good only. Fresh out of the kitchen. We were first to arrive for lunch. Server was creepy as hell. Stood there and stared at us the entire lunch. We were alone at 11 am for about 40 minutes in this place before people slowly trickled in. They need to take this advise very seriously.....open a freaking curtain! Dark and depressing. What a management fail. If you're reading this. You should immediately consider removing the nasty paint off the windows and open the blinds or add curtains. I hate when an owner doesn't invest back in their own restaurant. It looks disgusting and lazy. The bathroom is gross too.  You do these thing and I guarantee the patrons will come. Right now it's not looking good."}
{"text":"Guru Palace has quickly become the favorite lunch spot of mine, and another coworker.
While I wouldn't typically recommend an Indian lunch buffet - this place has a great one. It's like $8 and the selection is much wider than what is typically served at other buffets -- and the dishes changes from day-to-day so that's nice, too. Along with the ever-present chana masala and chicken tikka masala, there's usually several other veggie dishes, like pureed eggplant, or eggplant and potato... it's all quite good. There are always three desserts, too, and the chai is delicious.
The highpoints, however, are the fresh garlic naan they bring (best in the Valley, IMO) and the very friendly waitstaff, who I think are the owners, too."}
{"text":"The food here is very good however the service is hit or miss.  We go here every couple of months and eat inside.  The decorum inside is great and the food is fantastic.  Unfortunately the service can occasionally be sub par.  Example: the other night we waited almost 20 minutes before we were even offered our drinks after we sat down.  Then waited another 10 minutes until we got them.  Then another 10 minutes before we were asked our dinner order.  They were busy but 40 minutes until we could order?  We've had other occasions where the service was perfect.  Like I said, hit or miss."}
{"text":"First time eating here and found the staff really helpful and checking on us constantly. The food was great! We tried the tandoori dinner and it was delicious with more than enough food. We will go back again to try more stuff!"}
{"text":"Need a new Management !!!! ...understaffed, chicken tikka have no flavor.... they cut down on the Buffet  menu items.... had to ask for water ...one waitress for the whole place ...this place is not the same ....."}
{"text":"I have only had take out from here but was impressed BOTH times. The food was excellent! I love that they use Door Dash for delivery too since its not super close to our house. 
Chicken Tikka Masala is EXCELLENT
My husband like the Chicken Vindaloo.
Highly recommend for TRUE Indian food!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing, authentic Indian restaurant... Right here in the heart of Gilbert! I'm full of bliss to find such great food right here in town. Their vegetarian dishes are phenomenal -- I recommend the Baingan Bharta (spicy eggplant) with some of their fantastic garlic naan. The staff also always has a great attitude, as well, and they will help you with your selections if you don't know what spice level you want, or how much rice to get, etc. Also, they have a great in-house ambience (greeted with ornately carved wooden furniture and gorgeous murals on the walls), an easy online ordering system, and are open until 10:00pm all week. I totally get why they were voted one of the Best Of Phoenix. Definitely worth a try. (And with low-lit indoor and outdoor seating, it makes a great date spot!)"}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of this place but occasionally get this when visiting my parents in Gilbert. I normally don't write bad reviews (because unless the experience is terrible, nobody feels the need to waste time and write a bad review) but I am especially peeved from my recent experience. Let me start by saying that the times I've been before weren't the most outstanding experiences either but they've never been terrible enough for me to exert myself to write a bad review. 

This time we ordered the Shahi paneer with naan to go and the curry came back literally watery. The paneer looked and tasted like it was a day or two old and over all there was no taste to the curry. I kid you not, it tasted like water. The naan was decent, nothing exceptional, but the size of the pieces are very small and thin. Let's just say me giving a two to this place is being generous. 

Bottomline, there are better options for Indian food in the Phoenix area. You're better off just driving a few extra miles for some decent tasting authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"i like their chicken biryani. That's the only + thing. Their Shahi paneer didn't have any salt in it. Last time when i visited this place during dinner, the water they served me had a hair in it. The server didn't had the courtesy of apologizing. Plus i didn't find the staff to be very courteous."}
{"text":"It's been a couple of weeks now since my bf and I went to Guru Palace but the experience is memorable so it's easy to review now.

Everything we ordered was delicious.  I ordered the Chicken Korma, my bf ordered the Tandoori Mixed Grill.  We also tried the Palak Paneer.  And naturally ordered some rice and garlic naan to go along with it all.

I loved the Chicken Korma.  Tender pieces of chicken in that heavenly sauce.  Scooping it up with the garlic naan is the best.  

The flavor of the Mixed Grill was scrumptious.  The lamb was a little tough, thus the reason I'm only giving Guru Palace four stars.  If I had to go by flavor alone, they would absolutely get a five!

The Palak Paneer was just the right mix of creamy spinach and cheese.  

We ordered everything mild and the staff checked back a couple of times to make sure the spice level was good for us.  It was great, in fact I'd say next time we might be willing to go up to medium.  

Having ordered so much there was plenty to take home and our server boxed everything up for us so we didn't have to do it.  

When my bf ordered a Heineken, the server very astutely steered him to an Indian beer.  It was perfect with the food.

Thanks, Guru Palace!  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love it and been coming for years. 

Only thing I would improve is the consistency of the all important Chicken Tikka Masala. It can be a little weak sometimes. 

Aloo dishes are always great though. :)"}
{"text":"We were looking for an Indian buffet and of course everything closes at 2 o'clock to 5 o'clock usually however this place happened to be open till 4 o'clock and they had a buffet for under nine dollars! We ended up going and were super impressed with both the service and the quality of food. They kept bringing warm fresh food in the buffet. They also had fresh Mango lussie and hot chai with milk. Excellent place with great service and very very good food we will definitely be back to eat more food!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the atmosphere isn't my favorite. I love the tikka masala, vindaloo, cauliflower and curry dishes. The buffet is great because they let you buy takeout boxes! I don't like how they charge $8 for sauce only though. I like to order tikka masala sauce, but it's just not worth it because I'd have to pay for rice too."}
{"text":"They say Phoenix has no real Indian restaurant and Guru Palace is yet another example of why this is the case. This place is nothing like the restaurant I went to many years ago. It's sad to see it devolve from an upscale restaurant with fine service to a \"hole in the wall\" IMHO. From a darkly lit ambience with candles and table clothed tables with ample waiters dressed in shirts and ties to two waiters, one of which seemed half asleep and another guy running around somewhere. From the lighted flame that used to greet you at the door to a cheap looking light fixture that now sits in it's place. What was also noticeable was how empty the place was. This placed used to be packed with busy families, and couples going on dates etc. . If you didn't have reservations, you would have to wait for table on weekends. 

Where to start: the service is clearly lacking! There was no hostess to greet anyone or take orders. There guys behind the bar that you kind of just made eye contact with or shouted to be seated. After making reservations and being seated, no waiter approached our table. I had to stare down our waiter and ask if he was going to take our order. He made it seem like we were troubling him (the restaurant was not busy at all and they had several empty tables for a weekend night during prime time). They never refilled glasses. The water was served without ice. When asking for cups with ice, again, we received the stare as we made these poor guys actually do their job. 

The food was disappointing. The Chicken tikka came served in sloppy mess of onions with an overabundance of vinegar. Chicken tikka is supposed to be served sizzing, hot and dry not a bunch of weakly marinated practically white pieces of chicken breast that resembled a fajita more than chicken tikka. I can't believe they served that. 10 years ago, that same chicken from this restaurant came out sizzling with a deep red and nice grill marks with sizzing sauteed onions. The daal tasted like it had sat the buffet hours earlier. It was watery with no flavor or spice. The chicken tikka masala curry tasted like chicken with Campbell's toamto soup poured over it with a touch of cream IMHO

This is common phenomenon in the Phoenix area. A once great Indian restaurant slowly devolves over time and that's exactly the impression I received here. It certainly has potential to be a better restaurant and I certainly hope the owner does more to improve their product IMHO"}
{"text":"I was super stoked to try this place for take out, as it had gotten great reviews, however, my \"mild\" food was so spicy I couldn't even eat it. Not sure what the \"hot\" would taste like, but I don't even want to know. Such a bummer."}
{"text":"I was hesitant when I first arrived because there weren't very many cars outside, but was pleasantly surprised when the food came. Our samosas were simply incredible and the paneer and chicken dishes that we ordered were divine. The best part about the meal, though, was that their naan was perfect - not too dry and not dripping with oil. The perfect balance. Only suggestion if you're looking for an amazing Indian food night and love the spice - be sure to order your dishes at least a 7 to get them spicy enough to feel the burn! Great night out."}
{"text":"I usually go to India Oven up the street, but wanted to try something different. There were less options, but the chicken masala was tasty. I liked how the chunks were broiled on the outside. The rice isn't covered and so many bites had hard pieces. The curry chicken was all leg pieces and very tender. So tender that the meat breaks off in the pan and the sauce ends up having a lot of bone/gristle fragments. The staff were attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I usually get take out, however they are very inconsistent with their food. Some nights it's great, other nights it's bland. I stopped going there due to that, also I ordered rice one night and found a bug's leg in it. I have taken food back (once) due to it being completely tasteless and watery to the point where I could not enjoy it. I was told by the \"manager\" that I was poor and I couldn't afford to eat there. I was dumbfounded especially since I order takeout weekly and spend anywhere from 80-100 since I am feeding two. I haven't returned in over two months. I have been experimenting with other indian restaurants and have since found a place that is very consistent. I have NEVER been treated with such disrespect and I actually managed to overlook that one occurrence, however the food was lacking consistency. Some nights it was as if they gave me the leftovers from the lunch buffet. I can tell the difference, especially since I have known the owner and his brother since I was 10 years old. I was also told by a previous employee there that they re-use their lunch buffet during dinner service. That's disgusting! I hope they figure it out because it will hurt their business over time, and judging by their lack of customers when you visit....it already has."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I recommend their masala dishes, they are all amazing! Don't forget the garlic naan on the side. 

Great service super friendly family owned business."}
{"text":"I am not familiar with Indian food at all.   But I bought a groupon for this place because it was close.   So we went last night.  We both got a lamb dish and the garlic naan.   Mild spice.  I have heard Indian food is very spicy so wanted to make sure we could eat it.  It was fantastic.   I mean I'm still thinking about it today good, and had the leftovers for breakfast. .  Service was good.  It concerns me that it wasn't very busy.  Sure would hate to see it go out of business.   The food is that good.  Go try it.  I'm serious."}
{"text":"Yes, they are a tad on the pricey side, and they do seem to be hit and miss, judging by the reviews, but for me, last night it was all hit: Samosas  not quite flaky enough but very tasty; superb mushroom mattar cooked to perfection; and garlic naan bread that was oh so fresh, warm, and delicious. I only had to wait 10 mins. for a to-go order, and I sat at their bar, which was a good place to chill in itself. I'd been in once before w/ my g/f about 2 yrs. ago, and I would have given it 3 stars then, plus maybe a bonus half star for the atmosphere. Very dark, woodsy and well decorated. A nice spot to bring a date or grab scrumptious Indian cuisine to go (on one of their good days)!"}
{"text":"The buffet was plentiful and delicious. They even had soup with a dressing that you could add. The garlic nan was good as well. The owner welcomed us into the restaurant and checked up on us 3 times. I thought that was great. I know I'll be back.
it was $8.99 a person without anything to drink other than water.
The buffet also included different tropical fruits like watermelon, oranges, and a kind of rice pudding with nut flavor on it. ALSO don't miss the free yougurt mango drink that you get at the buffet. It was quite refreshing."}
{"text":"The food is great! however, the service is inconsistent, and especially bad during peak hours. Our food took twenty minutes to come out after the order was placed and it got worse with the waiter messing up the vegetarian order with non-veg food. The service ended with the wrong items showing on the bill to end the night!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Not super flavorful at all. Not sure how you do that with indian food. Service was terrible. 2 stars because it was cheap."}
{"text":"My friends and I used to go to Guru Palace in a regular basis. We loved the food and the service for the longest time. Last time we visited we found many new surprises, the quality of the food went down, the service was no longer prompt and friendly, lastly the bill came with an 18% gratuity added. Furthermore when I paid there was an additional line for a tip. I am not a penny pincher, rather I am generous tipping, but please do not tell me how much and when to do it. I will not go to Guru Palace anymore."}
{"text":"Great food. Service is OK not very friendly though.  Priced accordingly.agree with other reviewer's this place is rather on the cheap side what I mean by that statement is no rice beverages. Food is better here than down the street at India Oven but India Oven does offer better service better amenities just a nicer friendlier atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and i are adventerous eaters and wanted to try something new.  We were  first in the door at lunch and  quickly seated by a very nice male server whose name escapes me. He made recommendations for our meal as well as a great Indian beer. 

Food was incredible. I only wish i had a larger stomach to try more. i'm definately going back  for the buffett."}
{"text":"We totally enjoyed our meal of lamb Bryani, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, garlic naan & rasmalai for dessert."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for Guru Palace a few weeks ago and just used it this evening, boy am I glad that I did!  The food was delicious, the service was quick and efficient AND really friendly, and did I mention that the food was delicious?

First thing is first, the food was incredible.  My companion and I ordered the Samosa appetizer, Garlic Naan, Lamb Korma, and Chicken Tikka Masala.  I also had an Indian Tea (Chai) which was perfectly spiced.  The Samosa was amazing, the filling was moist and flavorful and the crust was delicate and flaky.  There was just the slightest hint of sweetness to the filling that really perfected the dish.  The Garlic Naan is the best that I've ever had!  I think I could happily make a meal of just the Garlic Naan and not regret it. The Lamb Korma was also amazing, the lamb was tender and flavorful and the sauce was rich and thick.  The Chicken Tikka Masala (a staple in my life) was to die for!  The chicken was super tender and swimming in amazing, thick, rich sauce.  The spice level was perfect in all the dishes- the server asked us on a scale of 1-10 how spicy we wanted our dishes and we ordered a 7.  I can honestly find no fault with any of the dishes I sampled!

The service is really great as well.  I was meeting my companion at the restaurant and I was the first to arrive; the staff greeted me promptly and made sure that I was comfortable while I waited.  As soon as my dinner companion arrived, we were seated and served water and complimentary Papadum with a delicious chutney.  I really liked our server (and all the other staff members that spoke to us), he was efficient and friendly, and happily recommended his favorite Samosa variety when we expressed interest.  During our meal, three different people (one being the owner I believe) stopped by to make sure that everything was good and that we were pleased with our meal and service.  I appreciated the attention, which felt genuine and was not at all bothersome. 

The atmosphere in the restaurant was also wonderful.  It is not a large place, but the tables are all well spaced, and the entire place is impeccably decorated.  There is a lot of art on the walls, ambient lighting, soft music, and well dressed staff.  Though it is still a casual restaurant, it's also nice enough to feel really good about taking a date there. 

I really enjoyed my meal and service at Guru Palace and I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here on monday the food was so good we went back on tuesday for the lunch buffet, it was my first experience trying indian cuisine and the food was fantastic.The service was better then I've had in many restaurants here in Az. so much so that I told family and friends about this restaurant and plan on taking them to enjoy the whole experience. The Garlic Naam fresh and hot you have to try it delicious as was all the foods on the buffet. Next time I go will be for the dinner menu."}
{"text":"This is me... This is me NOT on drugs... This is me saying that Guru Palace is just okay.

It's my fault though. This happens when I'm expecting way too much from a restaurant. Guru Palace has been on my list for some time now, but after they won Best of Phoenix, I had to try them immediately... so I made my way over there to enjoy a weekend lunch.

The restaurant is pretty gorgeous inside, mixing traditional art with and industrial and contemporary feel; that made me really happy. Everything was very clean and there was a lot of open space; again, I was very happy. The food was what started the decline of that happiness though. 

Some of the food was very good, like the Tikka Marsala - it definitely rivals India Oven's recipe and their garlic naan was excellent. But some of the food was seriously meh to me. I had some of the goat and it was extremely fatty (and I've eaten plenty of goat, I'm Middle Eastern), the mint sauce had absolutely no kick and the chicken curry (even though it had bones in it) didn't have that rich flavor that I associate with a great chicken curry. 

My hope is that I missed the dishes that earned this place the Best of Phoenix award, and I look forward to eventually making it back here some day to try those dishes. *Feel free to message me you know what I should try.*"}
{"text":"Got the mixed grill, lamb curry, and naan. Everything was very well made. The naan was crispy but soft (exactly the 2qy it's supposed to be), the rice was definitely basmati, the mixed grill came sizzling. It was a spectacular meal!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food in the East Valley! We always order the chicken tikka masala and have tried many other dishes off the menu. Never a disappointment. Make sure to go when you are not in a rush however; the service can be a little slow and the food takes a bit to prepare."}
{"text":"I've only been for the lunchtime buffet, but I really enjoy it. They don't have a huge number of dishes, but the ones they do have are very good. The chicken tikka masala is the best I've had anywhere, hands down. I could drink the sauce in a cup, I tell you.

The other dishes are fairly basic, but well prepared. It bothers me a little bit that they ask you if you want plain or garlic \"bread\" instead of naan. The all-you-can-drink chai tea is a nice plus."}
{"text":"Simply aweful!  The place had bugs.  Their food made me sick!"}
{"text":"They're pretty good but I like Indian oven even better. Very good customers service that for sure!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The lunch buffet is such a good deal and it's great that you can go on Saturday. The awesome thing is that you get a mango lassi with it. The service is good, the servers are very quiet but polite."}
{"text":"I took my 7 year old daughter here for first time. She loved it. Everything she ate, she loved. Food and service are great. Wide selection of food. I like the goat curry."}
{"text":"I went here on Sunday after I picked up my roommate from the airport. His flight was delayed so I was driving in circles with some serious hunger pangs. We decided to go get Indian food because we haven't had any since we moved here a couple of months ago. We had the Lamb Saag, Aloo Palak, and Garlic naan with complimentary papadum. Everything we ordered was great, esp. the Lamb Saag. 

So, now I'm on Yelp reading the review that Phil G has written, and I have to respectfully disagree. Although, this was the first time I had Indian food in the valley, it was super delicious. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 5 star rating that it is a tad pricey and service left something to be desired in terms of friendliness (maybe its because I asked for tamarind sauce to go with the papadum since it only came with one (mint?) chutney and that was totally blasphemous out here, and they couldn't look at me the same way again... I was told the tamarind chutney didn't really go with the papadum, and they were totally right... it was super sweet and wasn't what I was used to ) On the other hand, my water was never empty and they have really cool lighting. 

Some points of disagreement are that they are NOT strictly an a la carte place. They have an all you can eat lunch buffet, which I imagine as being equally as yummy from 11-2:30 PM for $8.99 a head ($5.99 for the kiddies under 8). I completely plan on making a visit during lunch hours and stuffing my face on a day when I miss being home or being with my boy because we always go out to eat Indian food together.  (Ah, the life of a graduate student...) 

All in all, I think the food was totally worth it because its been days, and all I can do is think about going back and how yummy everything was."}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience with our waiter, Kevin. Great food. Great atmosphere. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"MUST READ HEALTH HAZARDS !!!!!!!! I have been going to Guru Palace for years now. Before I started visiting this location I frequented another one of their restaurants (Indian Dehli Palace). Today, is the last day I will ever return to either. I usually purchase takeout and spend about 50 dollars each trip. I ordered takeout around 1pm which I usually order at night, and when I got home and tried everything...the food tasted unusually bland. The palak paneer was runny and I noticed it upon opening the container. I got a spice level of 7 which was probably a 3. The garlic nann which I the easiest thing to prep on the menu was old and lacked flavor. Even the hostess looked at the bread once and agreed that it was bad. I drove back all the way from McClintock and Broadway area to the restaurant to return the food. I was offered credits and discounts however I know from experience that sending food back and having them re-make it (especially when the wait staff was questing me so much) can potentially result in the chef or chefs \"messing with your food\". That may be my own personal worry but at this point I had lost my appetite and was seeking a credit since I honestly did not want to return to this location. It honestly felt like I was being interrogated the entire time I was there. I was told over the phone that the manager would be there in 15 minutes and when I finally arrived there about 40 minutes later I was still waiting (15 minutes) for the manager (the owners daughter) to arrive. Once she arrived I had to re-explain everything. I stated that the only thing that was cooked correctly was the dahl and the rice. I told her that I have never complained in the entire 10 plus years that I have visited their restaurants. I understand that sometimes a restaurant is going to have a bad day...it happens. So she calls the chef whom is outside on a break and since she spoke in Indian, I couldn't understand anything she was relaying to him. She got off the phone and proceeded to offer me a gift card when I told her from the get go that I simply wanted a refund. She told me that since I admitted that the dahl was cooked correctly along with the rice that I should pay for it. I said absolutely not. She continued to say that she spoke with the chef and he said he cooked everything correctly and that I was wrong. I was dumbfounded! Are you kidding me? She said no, this chef has been here for 20 years and he cooks everything correctly. At this point I was heavily offended because one I was being questioned (I'm the fucking customer!) and two she proceeds to walk back toward the register bitching that I didn't have any money which is why I am returning it. She told me she couldn't reuse any of the food because I had put some of the rice and dahl back into the containers (I RETURNED EVERYTHING IT WAS SO DISAPPOINTING) I told her I would hope she wouldn't reuse anything that anyone returns, as it is against health codes. Are you kidding me?????????? I cannot believe how many people I have referred to this place. Worst customer service/dining experience of my life."}

{"text":"I was always not willing to try new foods and then my wife talked me into trying indian food. Guru Palace is the best in the east valley that we have eaten at. Great service and great food."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Open late until 10! we had the chicken vindaloo spicy and the vegetable korma and the presentation was very nice. Every single member of the staff was very friendly and warm. 

It is one step above Curry Corner for formalness so if you want very good indian food in a slightly nicer restaurant come here!"}
{"text":"Great Indian buffet. Delicious vegetarian dishes, especially the one with Cauliflower."}
{"text":"Used to be good....but has gone down hill they just need to maintain better quality Indian food even when it's a buffet. It's becoming less authentic making it Mexican/Indian!"}
{"text":"Delicious food!   Lots of dishes to choose from for both vegetarians and omnivores alike!   Complimentary mango lassi and deliciious chai tea come with the lunch buffet (never seen this at any other Indian buffet).  Atmosphere is nice and service is excellent!  Go ahead you wont be disappointed.   I gave it four stars for the prices...Slightly overpriced...but the food is so delicious I make it a destination.  I would come here more often if it were a couple bucks less...   Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"As I was raised in London England, I grew up on Indian food. This makes me a bit of an Indian food snob. Guru Palace  is about as good as I have found in the Phoenix area.

Do not go on Monday nights as the normal chef takes that night off. His replacement doesn't even come close to measuring.  On Monday nights the food wouldn't even rate 1 star."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment. I feel bad for those of you that rate this place highly, you really need to try some good Indian. 

I didn't think it was possible to have bland Indian food but boy did this place prove me wrong. I stopped in for the lunch buffet based on a foursquare tip that the place was voted Best Indian in the New Times. I'm not sure who was doing the voting or the tallying, but I have to think it was a big mistake... or it was fixed. 

I tried a couple of bites of almost everything on the lunch buffet, 4 or 5 different veggie options (I tried every veggie option they had) and 2 different chicken dishes (Tika Masala and Curry). All dishes except 1 (one of the veggie options, I don't remember which) was bland and needed salt. Mind you, I've NEVER once before used salt at an Indian restaurant. Here, everything needed it. 

The only saving grace for this place was the garlic naan and the desserts - the minced carrots with sugar and cheese was tasty and different. 

The service was less than mediocre - had to ask for my drink twice and the bill twice. 

Safe to say that I will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"$60+Tip for some of the most mediocre Indian food I have ever put in my face.  I was initially going to give this place a two star rating but the longer I thought about it (and the better, cheaper food I had elsewhere: six bucks at Mike's Big Breakfast comes to mind as does the $20 we spent at Joe's Farm Grill) the more pissed off I became. At Joe's Farm Grill we ate food that provided about triple the amount of pleasure for a third of the cost and we got to do it in a very pretty part of Chandler. 

Sheetal R. Already gave an excellent rundown of what we ate and what was good and what meh so I won't repeat that here. 

The food here is not terrible but the cost is so disproportionate to the quality of the food that I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone. $60 for two people should buy you FANTASTIC food not barely mediocre food."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food and food service. I think it is the best in the east valley and I have tried all of them.  They Always make me Chana Shaag which is not even on the menu."}
{"text":"After visting this place it is clear that all the reviews you see above are FAKE!!Read the reviews closely and you will see that the construction and grammer of the sentences are all the same. Infact you can go to the website of gurupalace and you will see that a full page is devoted to giving the links of these reviews!!I i know exactly what GOOD INDIAN FOOD is all about and this place is no where near even AVERAGE. You get dozens of places of this class in and around Arizona. The garlic naan which is described in every review is absolute nonsense. You cannot even get a whiff of garlic. And some of them are like PAPADS! The malai kofta was extremely irregular. While the first serving I had was bland, the next serving was very salty.The price is qouted at 8.99 and this is nothing great or no big deal. Every indian buffet in Arizona will cost you the same. And there was no masala chai as they advertise!!The waitresses are extremely useless and there were times they would just throw up. And to top it all, they make you pay the bill by asking you to walk up to the counter !! Again there is nothing so authentic of the look and feel of the place. Just plain .I could also see some non Indians making a point to the owners that the food was not authentic indian fare but the owner was adamant that his food was equisite!!Anyway who wants to argue?Just avoid this place.The table was also not cleared regularly and there were not enough plates also.On top of all this, people like me and you get fooled by the great reviews posted on this site and there is always a mad rush here but I can assure you that all those people who form the rush at this place are first timers like me who will never return again."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch buffet! Everything cooked perfectly and very fresh. Best service for a buffet as well. We stop here every time we go to Trader Joe's."}
{"text":"1st Indian experience in Arizona was great, I ordered Shrimp curry, shrimp rice, and garlic flat bread takeaway and drank a beer while waiting which was great. I got home and ate the food and it was spicy as ever. I love spicy as it makes a great adventure when you feel the heat. Shrimp were nice sized and scrumptious balancing the heat. Prices are higher but so is quality. I recommend Guru!"}
{"text":"Mehhhh... tried it for the first time.. had mutter paneer and roti... pretty ordinary.. I should have figured when the place was pretty empty... the service was good... but that's pretty much it! 

I have had better in the Mesa / Tempe area.
Hilal Grill (meat) & Nandini (vegetarian) are my two favs.."}
{"text":"Indian food is one of my favorites, and I don't know why it took me so long to try Guru. I have been there now several times and I opt to order off the menu instead of the buffet. Every meal I have had has been very good and has all those warm comforting spices I love in Indian food. And of course who can forget the garlic naan, delicious! The staff have always been very friendly and answered any questions that I have had. Guru has become a regular lunch spot for me!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday lunch buffet and was pleasantly surprised.  I hadn't eaten Indian food in a while and was missing it for some time.  I used to live in Dallas where there is a huge Indian population and 93% of my coworkers were Indian so I have an idea of what they think is good food since we often ate together for lunch and sometimes dinner.  I am not an expert.

I think the Goat Masala and Chicken Curry were delicious.  4.0 stars.  The meat was very fresh, soft and moist.  You can tell this was slow cooked.  These were my 2 favorite dishes there.  And the fresh garlic naan that was served by the waitstaff was hot and fresh baked.  It was good.

The chicken tikka masala was good too but I only gave it 3.5 stars.  The baked fish was okay.

Now for the vegetable dishes, I couldn't eat them.  I've had much better.  Much much better.  I gave the veggie dishes here 1.0-1.5 stars.  Just on the low end of low end.  If you are primarily searching for vegetarian dishes, this is not the place as you will be disappointed.

If you enjoy the 2 meat dishes I noted above, then you will like this place.  It may not be the best of the best, but for the $8.99 price they are offering, its a great deal.  I've had better but those were costly places in Dallas.

The nice thing is that you get the Mango smoothie and Hot Chai Tea with milk included in the buffet.  What a deal for $8.99.  I found the smoothie to be very good and the hot chai tea to be spicy (how Indians like it, not like Starbucks Chai Tea :)).

I definitely will be coming back here again.  Service was good.  And the Indian rice pudding was yummy!  Loved it.

Update 05/09/2018: The vegetarian dishes were way better today.  3.0-3.5 stars.  Must be a different chef today. :) However also today the goat masala and chicken curry were not as good, only 3.0-3.5 stars.  I guess it really depends on the day you come."}
{"text":"This was EXACTLY what my wife and I were looking for. Although we did make the mistake of going for dinner and paying for every thing individually (46.99) instead of the 8.99 lunch buffet.... But the food, Ohhhhh man. So tasty. tandoori shrimp tiki masala on spice #4 was the JAM! Definitely will be going back.. For the lunch buffet. ;)"}
{"text":"We all piled in the car and headed to Mesa for some Indian food. For whatever reason we've all been dying for some Indian food this past week.. dreaming of naan bread, Id been waking up with a puddle on my tummy.. it was time to fulfill my dreams and desires.. all you can eat style!!

The garlic naan here is simply amazing and they bring basket after basket.. the buffet items were all freshly prepared and delicious. The group favorite was the chicken masala.. super tender white meat chicken in a creamy yogurt sauce. From the lentils to the chick peas, every thing we tried was super great! Okay except for.. the tandoori chicken.. dry as a pop corn fart. 

I hope I'm not alone in my naan bread dreams.. they seemed so real!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good and the staff is always super friendly. One of my favorite dishes is chicken tika masala and this is really good here with the rice. They also have this carrot salad that I never thought I would like and it was so good."}
{"text":"I think one of these reviewers was a little harsh on the staff at Guru Palace. They are from a very reserved culture, so cut them some slack. I think they are  very pleasant and attentive. They are very willing to explain the dishes and that after dinner herb mix( for digestion & fresh breath). I love Indian food, the spiciness, the slow cooked meats, flavorful vegies...."}
{"text":"Guru Palace has a very fast service and gives you amazing flavorful Indian food. Main dishes we order are lamb or chicken korma, chicken tikka masala and the garlic naan bread."}
{"text":"I simply love this place. Great food and great service. I do a lot of carry out and its always just the way I ordered it. You can choose spice level on most foods. Which is a plus for someone like me who loves spicy food."}
{"text":"Guru Palace is the only place on the East side that I've found can make my favorite Indian dish - Rogan Josh.  For that alone, it has become a favorite of mine.  They also have wide variety of other regional dishes for people who like something OTHER than curry (yes, there are other types of Indian food for those who may not know).

I have never tried the buffet but several people I've gone with have had it and said it's very good.  The naan bread is perfect as is the cucumber raita.  There are two things that keep Guru Palace from 5 stars in my book.  First is the entree pricing - pretty expensive compared to many other Indian restaurants.  Second, I find the service to be somewhat curt; a warm welcome wouldn't hurt.  Every time I crave Indian though, this is where I get my fix!"}
{"text":"I have been to many Indian restaurants and I truly enjoyed Guru Palace. True, it is not fine dining but I find the food to be delicious and authentic. If you go between 11 am and 2:30 pm, as their website states, you can enjoy their buffet, tasting quite a few different dishes for a good price."}
{"text":"I've been scouring the Valley for a good Indian food place and was hoping that Guru Palace would/could be it.

I was mistaken. It's not bad, it's not good. It's just kind of ... there. I'll eat there again if someone suggests it, but I won't go out of my way to offer it as a place for my friends and I to gather.

I was there for the lunch time buffet that was priced at $8.99.  Not bad. My friend and I were offered naan and I was about to say yes when my friend asked if we would be charged extra for it - we weren't.

They had chicken tikka masala and chicken korma out. The chicken tikka masala was ok, but nothing to write home about, as was the chicken korma. I decided to sample their palak paneer and found it was the best thing they had. I also tried their curried pakora...big mistake. I like pakora, but to combine it in a generic yellow curry sauce was a mistake. It just wasn't right. It didn't taste right either - neither to myself or my friend.

As I said, the food was ok. I was impressed with the decor and the overall cleanliness of the restaurant.

The servers were attentive and friendly. I swear, for every sip of water I took, someone was there topping off my glass. I like that.

I'll give it a go again and see if they can change my rating...but I'll wait till a friend suggests we go."}
{"text":"Everything as you enter this fine establishment seems first class!  From the ambiance featuring high ceilings ornately decorated and the traditional sitar music playing in the background.  Every dish the my co-worker and I tried was warm, delicious and flavorful.  They even offered some fresh fruit offerings of perfectly ripened fruit.  Palak paneer was fresh and flavorful with the paneer (cheese cubes) having a true \"home made\" flavor!  They also offer great meat dishes including Chicken Tikka and Tandoori Chicken.  The next wonderful discovery was a terrific goat stew.  Some places will prepare a goat biryani with greasy slivers of goat meat in a rice mixture.  This \"stew\" which I believe is served daily, had large and lean chunks of perfectly cooked goat!  Goat is so much more flavorful than most lamb and leaner than beef.  (It also has some health benefits which you can google!)  Very polite staff and rather inexpensive for the quality.   Goat Council Member out!!!"}
{"text":"Good home cooked authentic Indian food rivaled by none other that I have tasted! Love the Veggie Korma tried it a little spicier this time, they gave me about an eight (on the spicy) scale. It was amazing the atmosphere takes you out of this world, friendly staff are there to help you order to your taste. Can not say enough about the Guru Palace!"}
{"text":"This is a good place if you are looking for North Indian food. But if you are looking for Dosa, Chapati etc this is not the place."}
{"text":"This is a mediocre Indian restaurant. I have tried some vegetarian options and chicken. The vegetarian options are decent but chicken is terrible."}
{"text":"came with a party of 7... place wasn't busy, but there was a sort of long wait for food. Decent portions, but a bit oily.  the flavors were good, but i think they used garlic granules on the garlic naan (bummer).  the okra had some woody bits and i think it was from frozen... not a dealbreaker, as i personally find dealing with fresh okra to be a bitch.  pretty good, but not quite as good as taste of India in Seattle."}
{"text":"Vegeterian dishes have an awesome kick that keeps getting you coming back and a traditional sit down meal on the floor which is a common way to eat!"}
{"text":"This is the spot for Indian food in Mesa. I got the lamb korma and the chicken tiki Marsala. They were both perfect."}
{"text":"Please return to the greatness....

Many many fond mouth-watering memories of deliciously complex flavors insist that I rate Guru a 3 STAR (I can't bring myself to rate it 2 Stars it would feel such a betrayal). But over the last year I have found myself progressively disappointed and longing for the pre-2017 yum-splosiveness.

The flavors seem muted now, not bland compared in isolation, but definitely so in comparison to Guru's brilliance a year or more ago.

I hate saying it's just OK now.

I want to hop in the DeLorean, roar up to 88 mph, kick in the Flux Capacitor, and return to the glory days when:

 - Darcie and I were ambassadors to so many friends who had never tried the cuisine
 - Guru Lamb Vindaloo, Sheesh Kebab, and Biryani of any type had the power to arrest all your senses such that you could only live in the complex flavors.

I'll be back Guru. Back fearfully but with the highest of hope."}
{"text":"We had a really nice time here. We used the on the floor seating tucked intimately away from the main dining area. It was really, really nice. Quiet, private, and relaxed. We watched an Indian crime drama on the TV hung over the bar while dining on a large wooden table with our feet stretched out beneath.  

The food was great. Some of the rice was scorched, but we ordered extra so it was a non-issue. I had vindaloo at \"medium\" spice, but was actually very mild. I am not complaining. I am sure they could have killed me with spice if I'd asked for it. Most vindaloos that I have had suffer from taste to spice ratio. The less the spice, the flatter the taste. Guru Palace did not have this problem. The flavor was there, but not the spice. 

I would recommend this place for dining. I don't know about their buffet. For dinner -- especially as a date--, sitting in the \"on-the-floor\" seating section, it was special."}
{"text":"Guru Palace is a great place to have lunch. I have been there a few times and have enjoyed their lunch buffet and great service. I highly recommend this spot to anyone that wants to take someone out on a first date or even a romantic dinner. Be warned this food is addictive."}
{"text":"I have been going to the Guru Palace for years! It will always be one of my favorites! You have to go to know for yourself whether its the way you like it or not!"}
{"text":"Not on my student budget, but you can find a discount coupon on News Times. I did enjoy the Chicken saag that I had. It works better for groups, as that way you can try different things. I was able to try some other chicken preparations and lamb, which tasted good. Anyway, next time I'll have to talk with my Indian friends :).

Good service and friendly people!"}
{"text":"I typically try to reserve 5 stars for places that are creative/ inventive/ unique, but I really can't find any fault with our experience. The food was really good and not overpriced, and the service was super friendly. Great experience and we will return :)"}
{"text":"Great Indian food! I always get hot, fresh food that hits the spot, every time. Love this place. Go & try the Chicken Tikka, not Tikka Masala, just the Tikka, with rice & garlic naan - I promise you'll go back again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"Ate there and got food poisoning that evening from my dinner there. I called them the next day and told them about it and what I ate and they could care less. I will never go back there."}
{"text":"The customer service here was awesome. Everyone was super nice and the interior space was huge, so you won't feel smothered. This was my first time trying this place and my lady and I called in some carry out. Be aware they won't let you apply the check in offer to carry out (to be expected). The food was mediocre at best. The naan was burned and the the chicken tikka masala tasted like it had a Ragu sauce. We had the lamb korma and it was just okay. The worst dish we ordered was the tandoori wings which are my absolute favorite. They were tasteless and bland. Nothing more than just plain chicken wings. Even the Rita didn't quite taste right. Overall I was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"If you're craving Indian food but not super close to this location, just go here anyway. I drive past multiple other places because I have never been disappointed in their food. It's delicious, normal price range, just delicious."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. I've only ordered here twice before, but I'm seriously considering buying a lot of their food to store in the fridge for the week! It's good food-pretty spicy so if you have issues with spice you may want to beg them to tone it down, but it probably wont happen. My husband didn't car so much about the spice though, which he usually does, because the food was so good. I don't think you can go that wrong with indian food though. I ordered through eat 24 and when I got there to pick up my food I had to wait some. The lady that greeted me was super nice and offered me some water while I waited. She was very concerned that I had to wait even though I wasn't because she had already created a nice atmosphere for me to wait. The dining hall is beautiful and inviting. I will definitely order from here again and would recommend."}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME OR TASTEBUDS!! This is by far the worst food I have ever had. I ordered chicken tikka which shoulders up with just pieces of chicken. No thari (curry) or anything resembling the traditional dish. The matar panned and bhangin was absolute garbage as well. The most tasteless Indian food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Yum!!!! We really really enjoyed our dinner tonight. The spices were perfect and the cool mango lassi turned down the heat (we had a level 10 tonight to clear the sinuses!). Everything from the paneer naan to the lamb vindaloo was delicious. And the service was top notch with everyone being welcoming and knowledgeable. Can't wait to come back and try more! Thanks!"}
{"text":"The food was good the variety they offered was great it's a must try if you like Indian food"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Everything I've ordered so far is very good. I especially love their naan bread and chicken tikka masala. My husband gets their butter chicken and loves it."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. Samosas were fantastic! The service was tremendous as well. Everyone was engaging and friendly and definitely not overbearing. I would love to try this place at lunch the next time I am in Mesa!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed Indian food and it can be tough to get something good in AZ.  There is a lot of average stuff but Guru Palace is excellent.  They have a small floor seating section for those that want to get the full experience.  We did that once but we were so full after I had to roll out of the place.  The wait staff is always friendly and someone always stops by to check on how everything tastes and the spice level.  

They have a nice selection of Indian beers.  They come in handy when you order it spicy.  The vegetarian, tandoori and non-vegetarian dinners are a great option if you want variety.   Their tandoori is surprisingly moist and is very tasty.  Lately we have just started trying different things on the menu and haven't been disappointed with anything but I will list a few of my favorites.  The Chili Chicken appetizer is awesome, trust me on that.  It is spicey and sweet (which isn't usually my favorite) but the balance is perfect.  Anything spinach is great for veg dishes as well as the lentils, eggplant, and potatoes.  We (1 male - 1 female)  usually get one appetizer, naan, 2 entrees, rice, and a few beers.  There is always leftovers.

We usually go midweek or on a Sunday but chose to go on Friday.  The place was very busy and there were 3 large parties of what I presume were Indian folks.  That is always a good sign when searching good ethnic food.

It seems the only poor reviews are from buffet goers.  If you go looking for cheap food and lots of it, the leftovers from the day before probably won't be as good as ordering it fresh at night.  Expect that, it is a buffet! But if you are looking for good food and aren't trying to shovel in the most calories try out dinner and you shouldn't be disappointed.  Nobody judges a place based on the buffet.  That is like complaining about the day-old bagels being too hard."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Indian places I've ever eaten at.  Their chicken curry is delicious as is their chicken tika masala.  They have an excellent buffet as well.  Very good place to eat."}
{"text":"Many of my reviews are long and wordy, giving the owners and management the opportunity to get honest feedback. Guru Palace makes this easy - there is no \"The Not-so-Good\" section for them, only the reasons they get full marks and one very prestigious honor:

This is the BEST curry I have ever had - which includes a Tour d' Curry I went on in England, trying to find the best curry.

The Good:
 - Food: Again...I say only that THIS IS THE BEST CURRY I HAVE EVER HAD. The garlic naan also incredible - flaky and light. The most interesting thing that I have started to notice with Indian restaurants is the anise and licorice mixes on the way out. Guru Palace has fresh, soft anise that puts a refreshing finish to your experience.

 - Ambiance: Guru Palace has the most beautifully appointed ambiance of any Indian restaurant I have visited. There is a place to sit at a low table on pillows with a group if you'd like to take the ambiance one step further. The lighting is romantic, but not so low as to make you miss the nuances of your company.

 - Service: After the second time my fiancee and I went to Guru palace, they recognized us and welcomed us back. When you order to go, they are on time and responsive to you.

- Prices: The most incredible thing about Guru Palace is that all of the things I mention above come at very reasonable prices. There are no surprises on your bill, and if you happen to come by for the lunch buffet, it's nothing short of a killer deal."}
{"text":"I've never really gotten into Indian food, but my wife loves if. We placed a take out order through Yelp and I have to say, chicken vindaloo is fantastic. Make sure you get it spicy! My lady enjoyed hers as well."}
{"text":"The food wasn't bad but when I checked my CC I found a \"foreign transaction fee\" from INDIA!! This place is in Gilbert! I don't appreciate paying for my food and getting an extra charge because they are trying to avoid US taxes by billing overseas! Won't be back."}
{"text":"Good service and good food.  They seemed a little perplexed about using the coupon on my phone.  I didn't like it when they took the phone - I have a lot of stuff saved in it."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time and enjoyed everything the buffet had to offer. The food had a wonderful flavor and the service was friendly. We were not offered a menu, just told the buffet was ready, so I am unsure what we could have had other than the buffet."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. One lady in particular (maybe owner) came to our table to ask how everything was. Food was absolutely delicious. They had several buffet options. I loved their mango Lassi and their tea.  First time here and we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is definitely the best Indian food I've ever had. I've been here a few times and it's pretty inexpensive compared to other Indian places in the area and the customer service is flawless. Everything is delicious and is actually a decent portion size! I got the chicken tikka masala and it lasted me three days with the rice that comes with it and the yummy garlic naan bread that's only $2.50. I wish more people knew about this place!"}
{"text":"Garlic naan with Palak Paneer so yummy.  Add some chicken curry and rice.  Wash it all down with chai tea and makes for a yummy lunch. Good Buffett.  Come and enjoy this place."}
{"text":"The Guru Palace is a great place to take to impress a date, if your date is easily impressed by a $20.00, a rose on your table, and run of the mill Indian food.  My date, is generally not impressed by that kind of stuff, but most of the time we go dutch on the bill, and why pay $20.00 for food you can get cheaper somewhere else.

It's an al a carte restaurant.  You want rice, bread, garnish, you'll have to buy it separately.  The food is tasty, but it's not head and shoulders above the other Indian restaurants in the Valley.  I suspect that a lot of what you pay for is the ambiance.  The place has great ambiance; I mean there is a single red rose on every table.  There's even a little side area where you can sit at what I assume is a low to the ground traditional Indian dining table with lots of pillows."}
{"text":"I have no idea what anyone sees positive in this buffet! I arrived today at 2:47 pm (Sunday) and service was piss poor; never even received the diet Pepsi that I ordered when I first sat down. 10 mins later there was still no soda but even that is ok. The serious deficiencies were that you had better get to the buffet when it first opens up. Im assuming this because ALL the entrees were luke warm to cold; seriously picked over, congealed as if the contents were never stirred to keep them from clumping together like cold cheese soup! ALL the meats, sauces, were cold. Just plain nasty. Salad was GONE! None! When I mentioned it, the waiters didn't even respond other than to look at me, then look at the container for the lettuce and other vegetables as if I were lying-they never refreshed them at all even after I told them. I took a taste of everything on my plate expecting the next group of food on my plate would redeem the place-NOPE! Still, 6 mins in, still no visible or actual attempts to replenish the salad bar; no Pepsi as well. After alerting the staff that not one item was warm to hot; and, after receiving a stare of disbelief that I mentioned anything constructive to tgmhe staff, exasperated, I left stating that I no longer wished to dine at this restaurant. Horrible.! Wow, I've not had such a horrible dining experience in years."}
{"text":"Guru Palace is my FAVORITE Indian Restaurant and I'm Indian so that says a lot!

When I go to an Indian Restaurant I look for multiple things: 
* \"nut free options\" because I'm allergic
* a decent combination of meat dishes and vegetarian dishes because my dad is a vegetarian
* clean/sanitary venue and silverware along pleasant service
* a variance in spice levels

Guru Palace hits EVERY single one on the nail. Plus their lunch buffet's on the weekend have great prices. This is 9/10 times when we go. 

My family comes here all the time because I am able to eat nearly everything and my dad had multiple options as well. Their food has great flavor and is the perfect level of spice. Some Indian restaurants forget that you have to cater to ALL spice levels and make their food so spicy you can barely taste the dish! Other places also sometimes don't understand that I am severely allergic to nuts, but Guru Palace does. My family goes there all
the time and the owners always show appreciation by coming to our table and talking with us along with the occasional discount.

For people that have never tried Indian Food, I would recommend their chicken tikka masala (I enjoy it with rice but you can also eat it with garlic naan), palak paneer, daal makhani, baked fish, tandoori chicken, gobi, mutton curry, channa masala, and muttar paneer. Pretty much every dish is great there--you can't go wrong! You can also order onions, lemon, and jalapeño on the side which is awesome to eat with your food! For dessert try the mango lassi and gulab jamun.

I'm truly in love with Guru Palace! I hope it never changes!!"}
{"text":"Overall this place is good, I think it is one of the better Indian restaurants in the metro. We had the lamb vindaloos, chicken Marsala and some of the garlic naan. The garlic naan is good but I actually prefer the regular naan. Both the vindaloo and the Marsala were great but they did go a little easy on the lamb, there was practically three small pieces of it. My only other complaint is the serving size for the price. If you go there with three people and have drinks and entrees expect to pay over $100 and probably not be full. Overall though a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Me and my family loved this place!
We are Indian Food snobs...and Guru Palace takes the cake!
For me..its the Biryani. Any Indian Place has to have a Great Biryani...
The Lamb Biryani was AMAZING! The meat was soooo tender!!
The rice could have used a little more veggie, and maybe more nuts..but the rice flavor was perfect.
The naan was really good and authentic.
The best part, was that for me, wife and two teenagers, and a beer, we walked out, after tip, paying about 55 bucks!
Most Indian places I have been, we were closer to 90 bucks.
We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken marsala  and garlic naan.  would recommend it highly"}
{"text":"We have been here probably a dozen times on Sundays in the last 2 or 3 years.  We love the buffet because there is always a great variety of Indian food and it is always delicious and I love the Mango Lassi.  The staff is great, always pleasant and making sure we are happy with the food and the chef is the same way.  He comes out and checks the buffet table himself to make sure everything is alright.  They are always friendly and the prices are very, very reasonable.  They always smile and say thank you on our way out.  It is always a pleasant experience & we always go home knowing we had a yummy meal."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet was excellent!  Lots of choices and a multitude of tastes.  Might be a little spicy (hot) for some but we loved it.  Staff was nice.  A keeper on our list."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other day, here are a few comments.  Here on business so first I went to Indian Oven, see my comments on them. The next day, decided to eat at Guru.  I reordered qeema samosa as appetizer and it was amazing just perfect! My main course was the tandoori chicken with bone...it's served in a hot plate.  I was not impressed with the flavor at all. In fact, I could taste almost American BBQ type sauce flavor with sort of a sweet kick.  Not good.  Moreover, it almost looked like a karahi type dish because there was so much oil on it and covered in onions.  Tandoori chicken is supposed to be cooked in skewers over charcoal or fire...I know Indian food, from the DC area :) 

The service was bad, this big guy serving as waiter was just simply careless and somewhat rude. The girl at least had some courtesy...don't think I will ever return here..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not left a review yet as I have been eating here for years! Let me just start by saying that I love Indian food. I have eaten at several Indian restaurants in the valley and this one is by far my favorite. Their sauces are so flavorful and the meat dishes come with tons of meat. My personal favorite is the chicken vindaloo. They also have delicious chai that you can get either hot or iced, which I really appreciate being that I order my food so hot(spicy) that sometimes it's hard to drink hot tea. 5 stars, every time."}
{"text":"Simply the best indian food in the Phoenix area.  I know the difference between the good and the mediocre when it comes to indian food having grown up on it so trust me when I say this is the good stuff.  Guru delivers the goods when it comes to spicy traditional dishes served in a cozy modern indian themed setting.  Don't expect amazing service, come for the food and you'll be happy.  My favorites are the Chili Chicken as a starter and anything cooked on in the tandoori oven for the main course."}
{"text":"The entire time I was here I kept thinking back to the scene in The Namesake where the family is eating together during the father's funeral.  Morbid I know, but when I watched the film, all I wanted was some good Indian food and living in Chandler these days, I knew that was going to be difficult to come by.  At least until I found Guru Palace that is.

The bhindi (okra) was perfect.  Crispy, not soggy.  All of the sauces were of the non-oily Indian variety (a serious plus) and my wife moaned a few times while swirling her garlic nan/chicken tikka masala burrito (her invention) around in her mouth.  Damn chicken tikka masala and its power over the one woman in my life!

The only sad part of the experience was not seeing gajar halva (carrot pudding) on the menu.  GP starts making that and its deliciousness matches the rest of the food and five stars will be imminent."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is a little over priced for me... Both times I went the food items I wanted were either gone or nearly so and not replaced while I was there. As for the food there is much better fare to be had even buffet (and I hear the by the order rather than the buffet is better). Overall a slight disappointment."}
{"text":"I havta say this is one of the better Indian Places I have been to in PHX. I like this place, right after say, the recently opened India Grill and maybe even better than Tandoori Times, Scottsdale. 

Sadly, we couldnt sit on the floor seating as it was already occupied by someone else ( need to go back to sit on it). We sat on a table which actually had a real candle, and the lighting is actually romantic (I cant believe I am saying this about an Indian Place in PHX). 

I am not sure if people understand the differences between Indian foods, but here is a small primer. This place is an out-n-out North Indian Food place, more specifically they specialize in Punjabi Style food. And don't let anyone else make you believe that there is any other style of Indian food that is tastier and creamier than Punjabi Food and this is hands down the best Punjabi food I have eaten in a while. Oh, I am not biased (since I am from South India). and with that yeah the south Indian cuisine is totally different than North Indian, its like going to a different country and sadly not many restaurants in PHX serve 'real' south Indian food (try Cafe Krishna or woodlands). 
and yes what most y'all people eat is infact North Indian food. 

Now that we have cleared this outta way, lets talk about Guru Palace. The place is about $$, but it is worth it. We bought the 10 for 20 yelp deal, which helps ofc too. The staff is friendly and attentive. The girl loves samosas, so we got them and they were good. We ordered the complete dinner, and I feel its the best thing to get for the price. I got the vegetarian dinner and she got the tandoori dinner.Check the pictures. It came with tea which was fab and the yummiest Garlic naans I have eaten. The desert was the usual Gulab jamoon which was also one of the best I have eaten (Check Pics). She tells me her dinner was fab as well. It also came with white rice and mine came with 3 curries of my choice. I ordered Malai Kofta, Mutter Panneer and Dal Makkani. She got the okra curry which I swear by was one of the best I have eaten at an Indian place in a long while. 

I am definitely coming bak again and hopefully I get to seat on the floor seating and maybe then I give them 6/5 :) Lets celebrate good places like these"}
{"text":"Never had Indian food until tonight and this place definitely satisfied our desire for something unique! I got the mahi mahi masala and my boyfriend got the shrimp korma, which were both delicious! Besides that the garlic naan was amazing with the sauces."}
{"text":"Awesome if you're a fan of Indian and Indonesian food. The place itself is highly atmospheric and the staff is very friendly. I had a co-worker from India check it out for me to see if the food was authentic or tuned to suit American's palates. She came back and gave it her seal of approval and narrowed it down to traditional Northern Indian cuisine (in case you needed to know :)).
If you can handle spicy, try the Chicken Saag. It rocks!"}
{"text":"I went here during the week for lunch with my 3 year old daughter. I asked them for a booster seat and they came out with a DISGUSTING high chair. They put it down and  I went to put my daughter in it and a ROACH went scurrying from the seat and down the leg of the high chair!!!!! I almost lost it. I always used to eat here and it's just not good anymore. Also the buffet is not even warm by the time you sit to the table with your food. I will definitely not be coming back though. The COCKROACH was the final straw. If that crawled on my daughter while eating out I am sure my baby would never wanna go out to eat again. It would have traumatized her. It sure did me."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've had better.\" Mass produced buffet food = low quality. This place makes me wish I was back in the Bay Area to eat at any restaurant that serves curry. 
All in all, the food does not leave a good impression. It is mass produced leaving the chicken dry in the Chicken Tikka Masala. Their tea is Ghai tea. I usually come back for seconds or thirds since I'm a curry fanatic. This just did not impress The Chicken TIkka Masala did not taste delicious. This is one of the poorest tasting curries I've tried.  Sorry to say, I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"So I wondered into this place today for lunch. The venue was nice and the service was mediocre. The place was very dim which may hide the full effect of either a clean or dirty venue. They did boast an A rating on their most recent health inspection so that is good to know. 

The buffet was adequate and stock with traditional Indian dishes. Chicken Tikka, pakoras, lentils, chickpeas, rice, curry of sorts..  etc. 

I ate rice, the red chicken, some ckickpeas, some eggplant, zucchini, pakoras, naan. The rice was basmati and a little dry. The red chicken was good, chickpeas a little sandy, the eggplant/lentils was good...the chicken tikka was a little dry even in all that sauce. The naan was garlic and good. I ate all my food and although being in good old Gilbert/Mesa Az, felt as though this was authentic and close to what I consider Northern Indian maybe even punjab style. 

I would recommend this to a friend with slight reservation.  I'll eventually return, but going out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely scrumptious.  Authentic East Indian Cuisine and a Buffett that is unending deliciousness.  I have marked Guru Palace as one of my favorite East Indian Restaurants!"}
{"text":"Great Indian food, this restaurant has attracted my family for years.  We always leave happy and full."}
{"text":"Cold and Dry food on a buffet. Really people? C'mon."}
{"text":"Although I've only ordered take out from here (several times), I recommend you check this place out if living in the east valley. Not only because the food is pretty good, but out of the limited options on this side of town, I think it's the best option we have.

Pros: The staff is awesome and always super friendly. Food is very tasty and authentic. Cost is reasonable.

Cons: Although the food is typically good, they are a big inconsistent with the flavor and heat. 

I hear their lunch buffet is pretty good, but have never had the chance to check it out. I say stop in and make your own opinion."}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews I decided to try out the buffet on Sunday afternoon.  My husband and I loved everything! The quality was spectacular and everything was super fresh.  The buffet offers  deliciously seasoned basmati rice (my favorite in Phoenix), chicken curry, chicken masala, pakora, palak paneer, goat curry, salad, fruit, tandoori chicken, chai tea, and regular or garlic naan.  There were a few other items, but I don't remember what they were called.  We ordered the garlic naan and it was to die for. It was perfectly grilled and had just the right amount of garlic brushed on it.  For only $8.99 it was one hell of a bargain. The atmosphere is also very nice with beautiful paintings and decorative fixtures. They also play soothing music.  We knew the place was going to be good when half of the patrons were Inidan. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone on the east valley. We will definitely return on the weekends for the buffet!"}
{"text":"I was craving something ethnic so my friend and I tried this place out for lunch.  Lot's of choices on the buffet, more than the typical Indian buffet, plus three kinds of desserts, mango lassi and garlic naan.  All this for only $8.95.  We will be back without a doubt."}
{"text":"Payed $12 for the Chicken Tikka Masala togo and they didn't even include any rice. I mean really, how much is rice? 20-30 cents an entre'? And the Masala was ok but was missing something..didn't taste bland but also wasn't spiced very well. Should've stuck to currygarden"}
{"text":"This place was suggested by an Indian co-worker.

Establishment -- pretty nice.  They have 2 tables for low-seating (Indian style).

Service -- servers were very nice.  Had great suggestions but were kinda pushy on making us try a bunch of entrees.

Food -- good food!  Everything we ordered was pretty good.  Although kinda pricey but servings were bigger than other Indian restaurants I've been to.  Garlic naan was good and HUGE!  We paid about $20 per person but we took home a lot of leftover.  We wanted to try alot of their stuff and didn't mind paying for good food :)"}
{"text":"Great food, always ready on time for to go orders and great service. I have ordered a few entries like the chicken biryani and even asked specifically for white meat chicken and got it each time. Onion kulcha and garlic naan is great. Have had the lunch buffet a few times and is all right, but made to order entrees are particularly good. Have recommended this place to others and heard nothing but good things as well."}
{"text":"I can't recommend the buffet, but I have had many dinners here, and it is usually pretty good.  Really, my first disappointing experience was my last visit (otherwise I might have given 4 stars overall).  The Malai Kofta (vege-balls) fell apart and ended up blending into the thick sauce.  I still enjoyed the dish, but I was disappointed.  I tried the Chicken Vindaloo for the first time, and it was done well, but I thought the dark meat chicken was kind of 'too dark'.  I had the Chicken Achari on a previous visit, and have to say the flavors were more complex.  I liked it more than the Vindaloo.  Garlic Naan is always a winner here."}
{"text":"The garlic naan was one of the highlight on their dish.  I have usually go down there for their Buffet and this was the one of the few time that I go for dinner.  It was a little salty in my eyes but we were practically ignored after they brought the dish.  Very little checking and rechecking for soda and water refills.  That said, my taste buds was flying all over the place since Indian food is one of the most flavorful cuisine in the world.  The owner recognized me and I really appreciate that.  Will be back again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and the curry is fresh and good! There are some cheaper Indian places but you may be compromising on quality. I really like India Oven which is just down the street, because it is $14 for a great buffet. But in my opinion, the quality is better at Gueu Palace. I was really happy with the non-veg dinner as a pickup order. It came with 3 delicious curries, rice, naan, dessert, some fried appetizer (pakora? I forget what it's called) and a piece of tandoori chicken. For me it was enough for lunch and 2-3 days of leftovers, so for $22 it was a fine deal and I'll definitely be ordering again soon!"}
{"text":"I actually ordered delivery through doordash, ordering all of my food to be mild as I'd just had mouth surgery and my stomach can be iffy if I don't know the level of spice well enough. I got my food and it was horribly spicy, to the point where I couldn't eat it at all! I called the restaurant and they said that they couldn't re-deliver because It was through doordash, but I could pick up replacements. I was mad at first, especially when they explained that a 5/10 was considered mild, but when I got there they didn't just replace the two dishes that were spicy, they gave me another serving of their delicious Naan, more rice, and a free dessert. They had me taste my malai kofta to be sure it wasn't too spicy, swearing they would make it again if it was.

So just beware that their version of mild is not mild at all! Otherwise, their customer service was so wonderful that I will definitely be going there/ordering from there in the future. And, of course, all of the food was delicious. Way too much for this girl to eat in one sitting!"}
{"text":"Good food, delicious ingredients, loved the mushroom curry & the rice.  Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Great Indian food. Rice portions are smaller than I would usually eat so I get an extra half portion. I usually take out, but the buffet is great and nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best North Indian food in the valley. Must try for those that like Indian food."}
{"text":"For dinner I was quite pleased with my entree and Naan.  Spice level was exactly as specified, all food was rather good and served hot.  I thought the food was clearly superior to Indian Oven nearby.  Friendly service.  Building doesn't look so great on the outside in this strip mall but it's ok inside.  Draft beers available."}
{"text":"I have come to Guru Palace a couple times for lunch/brunch.  I think the food may be good for people who do not like much spices, but the buffet is very bland.  I have had friends who have tried the food for dinner, and they don't have much better results.  The one positive in the meal is the garlic naan.  If I can order that and cook my own curry or get it from another Indian establishment, that would be the ideal situation."}
{"text":"I am new to Indian food and this has been my first Indian restaurant. Been back a few times, the food is very good and service is always excellent. Love the marsala dishes and chicken vandaloo is good too."}
{"text":"We've been eating Indian food elsewhere for the past year and now I could KICK myself! Hubs and I had an exceedingly rare date night with no picky eaters (read: 9 year old food snob and friends) we considered going to our \"regular\" place, but I was just not willing to dine in there.  During our \"East Valley FEED ME\" Yelp search, I remembered that I park in front of this place when I go to Michaels/Starbucks and dared my man to try a new place. I argued that I always see folks walking out of this place looking happy (during lunchtime) when they leave (usually a good sign, right?)  

So, off we went into the wild blue... oh wait, no, we just traveled down Baseline Rd. for a short jaunt and reached our destination. We arrived at what I would call \"dinner time\" but there was only 1 large group and 1 small table finishing up.  We're in Gilbert, folks... when it's dinner time, people swarm to restaurants and pack 'em solid for unholy hours on end.  Many a time we have left an establishment only to go to Plan B restaurant or even Plan C.  I'll admit it, I was cautiously, cautious.  As we ordered, I noticed others starting to move in. Before long, there were at least 5 or 6 other tables gaily ordering.

Before long, seriously, Sam, our waiter was TOTALLY on top of it... Sam arrives and since we are first-timers we asked him to guide us through the menu. What a GREAT tour it was!  We thought we'd just go with the regular go-to menu items... But Sam wasn't having any of that, Nooooooo. He wanted us to try what the regular clientele swore to be the best food on the menu. Obviously, these customers are not wrong! We devoured the suggested Vegetable Pakoras $4.99 (I'm not a sauce freak, but I recommend the sauce that comes with it!  Then Sam told us to try the Mixed Grill SIZZLER PLATE (under Tandoor Specials) Just, YES!  He had the chef spice it at a level 4-5, to be safe and it was perfect, sure we could've gone warmer, but nah!  Ohhhh Naa'n, how about some Garlic Naan $2.5, uhm YUMMY! It wasn't so heavy garlicky that vamps would cringe but it was enough to be flavorful. The Garlic Naan paired perfectly with what we know to be called Butter Chicken (or Chicken TIkka Masala) but this time with a twist... It was DARK MEAT instead of chicken breast.  We casually mentioned that cannot tolerate chicken breast so Sam ordered this other version (ask what it's called, because I can't remember) Sam earned a place in my heart, forever!  This waiter, Sam did something unheard of in today's culture... HE LISTENED and adjusted the order accordingly... whoa.


Just after our Tikka arrived and I was able to scoop the YUM YUM worthy rice on my plate, the aforementioned 9 year old calls our mobile in a panic.  \"Where are you?? We're here, no one is home!\"  Well, crud, dinner date over... With a quickness... The staff got us packed up as fast as lightening, got our check, but not before I said... I WANT ANOTHER ORDER TO GO! Did that slow down this restaurant, heck NO! I was packed up with a second order, an adjusted bill and OFF we went... 

I promise you Sam (and all you other amazing wait staff) I will be back, oh yes I will and next time, I'm bringing my posse. But please don't tell anyone in Gilbert about this place, I still want a table at dinner time, OK?!"}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars except for one thing....poor service.  The food here is excellent, full of flavor that pops and stimulates your senses, however they need improve the quality of service.  The waitresses are consistently busy but pay more attention to everything other than the customer.  We sat and watched 3 ladies walking around cleaning tables, folding napkins, preparing appetizers, etc...etc for 20 min. before they asked if we needed anything else.  The only reason is because my wife had to flag them down waving her hands just to get more water.  There were no lines of people waiting so why the urgency to clean and do prep work instead of taking care of the current customers there?  To make is worse an Indian couple and their son came in  (sat next to us) and got an order of naan, drinks and special requested sauce immediately.  Definitely felt discriminated.  The guy even turned around to me with a cocky smirk on his face as to say...i deserve better service than you because i'm Indian..hah!!!  Another thing to add, i ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala with 5 star heat.  When it finally came it was zero heat.  I had it sent back and it was about 2 star heat.  It is such a shame because i really really want to go back but i think it's time to try someplace else"}
{"text":"We love this buffet and are here the first or second we get in town.  We have tried many Indian restaurants in our travels and this is one of the best.  Two for lunch buffet less than $20 and you eat as soon as you walk in, no waiting. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Disregard the outside. The food is VERY good Indian food!!  I highly recommend this place.  I have had Indian food in the best of restaurants (London) and this place is quite good.  You will be impressed if you like Indian/Pakistani type food!"}
{"text":"Sad to see all the hating; up until Guru Palace popped up, we were driving out to Bell for our tasty Indian fix.

Guru Palace gets major points for being so gorgeous inside, and for the low-down Indian seating.  Even though it's a la carte, you can share pretty much anything.  I've been here on dates for less than $50 and a full full belly.

The brilliance of Guru Palace, however, is the $9 buffet with unlimited chai tea, and as much goodness as you can manage.  I think Guru Palace makes a good place for a date, but hell, on a Sunday afternoon when you've got the cravings for naan and paneer?  Guru is where it's at."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Super clean, always friendly, and the food is delicious! The lunch buffet is a great price for all that comes with it. But we like to come for dinner as well."}
{"text":"Overpriced for a small amount of mundane food. We paid $11 for 8 oz of paneer masala that tasted like bland tomato soup and 4 oz of rice that was too dry. Then we ordered naan, which was more like a tortilla. If you want Indian food, just go down the road to India Oven. At least their food taste good, taste like Indian food and they have a pretty decent buffet for $11."}
