{"text":"Great Place! Amazing customer service! My wife and I can't speak highly enough of our experience with Maria. It was our first time in Vitality Bowl and we had no idea what to order. Maria took her time to tell us a little bit about what they offer and the health benefit in each bowl. She was attentive, entertaining, and knowledgeable. She is a huge asset to your restaurant. We will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I normally love this place  except the wait times. But today my fiance & I placed an order online and showed up at store less than 5 minutes later. When we got there we went to the counter, a young woman helped us and she told us it would be 15 minutes. So we waited 25 minutes, during which 3 sets of people have come and left. So my fiance went to the counter and asked the guy working there now, if our order was ready yet. He checked the freezer & said it had been ready since we got there. OY! Okay no big deal my daughter  thankfully kept herself busy up until the last minutes. We're driving home & I take a drink, YUCK chocolate & chalky. I ordered a Tropical Paradise, talk about surprise to the palate. So disappointed. I'll take this loss this time, my fiancé's & daughter's was perfect hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"I just placed an order for a simple breakfast bowl and had to wait over 30 minutes. Really disappointed and it will be the first and last time I go there."}
{"text":"Awesome place with food that is real, delicious & nutritious! Environment is clean & modern. Friendly & personable staff that truly educate you on what you're putting in your body! I got a chance to chat with the owner Charlie & he is so kind and welcoming. I'm hooked on this place :)"}
{"text":"Not a huge bowl and fruit person but stopped by to check it out! It was amazing!! Way better than Daily kitchen! Fresh fruit and no artificial garbage! Hugest plus the customer service and the owner Charlie takes great care of every customer!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place for a healthy delicious breakfast, lunch or anytime snack! :)  I like the Re-hydrator and Invigorator from the juice bar. I went in the other day and Jessica recommended the Dragon Bowl, delicious! I would recommend Vitality Bowls over any other smoothie place in the area. Very clean inside and friendly staff. Thank you to Jessica for showing me the app. where you can pre-order and its ready when you arrive, I will be trying that out soon for sure."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! Everything I've tried there has been fantastic and I don't think you could ask for a better staff! I need to also mention how great everything taste while getting some great nutritional benefits! I'd much rather have one of there healthy bowls then a bowl of ice cream. Simply delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We loved the fact you can get a 28 oz portion for like 10$ and share it what a clean start to the day and they gave many free samples of smoothies too!"}
{"text":"Worst steak panini I've ever had. It most definitely wasn't grass fed seared steak lol it tasted like fatty Philly cheesesteak meat. Place seems cool needs more food options though."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and each time I've had to wait even if I've called ahead. They only have two people working on the orders -one if there is a customer. The last time I went I waited 25 minutes for a smoothie! I finally had to tell them that I had to go because I had somewhere to be. I was expecting to be in and out. You walk in and there's never a line, just a bunch of people sitting around empty tables waiting. I've finally decided to just call in my orders and yet I still get put on hold or I've still had to wait at the register for someone to assist me as they're both in the back.   I'll keep coming because I love the Acerola smoothie, but I definitely recommend ordering ahead about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Awesome little spot. Staff is very friendly and ensures that you are part of the loyalty program to give you points towards your next visit! My 4th time here in the last 2 weeks. Very tasty smoothies and bowls. Top notch quality and tastes as fresh as can be! Highly recommend this spot! 5 stars no doubt! Charlie was awesome meeting you sir! Thank you for your service!"}
{"text":"Great choices for the whole family, many vegan options and my favorite part is that it's organic as well!"}
{"text":"I am a repeat customer and value the product they provide when they can! Broken blenders are making this business not profitable. They have great acai bowls when the equipment works and what you order you can get! For the price they charge they should have top of the line equipment. Pretty sad when the employees say they have told management about the issues and it's not fixed, that's just money out the door, i watched three customers walk out-one refunded while I was here. No discounts for the 40 minute wait! And that is for a to go order! $40 order! Sadly I will find a new acai bowl provider until they fix their issues!  Next visit (10/14) was almost closing time and was abruptly greeted with \"sorry half of our kitchen is already closed\" in other words \"we don't want your business\". I just don't get it. This place is going to have serious competition very soon with the new juice and bowl place opening down the street and the attitude and lack of service is pushing me to go there. Also had to remind the employee that they have a reward program so she could enter my phone number."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is great!  I got the Nutty Bowl.  My friend got the Dragon Bowl.  It was amazing and well worth the price in my opinion.  The server was very nice and the restaurant clean (and modern).  The smoothie blenders are in the back so it is not all loud and annoying like Jamba."}
{"text":"I ordered two smoothies and two sandwiches and took 30 minutes to make. I complained and they just looked at me funny. Terrible service. Over priced sandwiches which are not that good. Smoothies are ok but still over priced. Tropical Smoothie a better over all choice."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place. The Vitality Bowl is my favorite. I normally call in my order ahead of time so that it will be ready by the time I get there since it usually takes 15 minutes for them to prepare an order and longer if it's super busy. Their fruits are fresh and cut up per order so it's understandable that it takes a while to assemble the bowls.   Aside from all their ingredients being super fresh, the size of their bowls are the best value!"}
{"text":"I saw an ad on Facebook for this business. So I got a vegetarian Panini the ingredients are good the bread seem to be toasted a little too long. I was going to eat it on the go but since the breads a little dry I'll have to wait till I get some vinegar to dip it into. I did try to order a sirloins  sandwich for my fiancé but I knew he was hungry and the sand which would've been small with only 2 ounces of meat. He's a bodybuilder so two answers of me won't do anything. I was helped by 3 to 4 different workers. They were all nice but I don't think that any of them knew much of the business. Maybe they focus on the vitality bowls more..?? I ended up getting him food somewhere else. This location is great the restaurant was full of guests when I first walked in. I'm sure it does great business it was nice and clean it just really wasn't for us. I might try one of the vitality bowls some time and then I will update my review."}
{"text":"This place is always delicious, has fresh ingredients and the staff is always friendly! For people who are like me and come often they have a rewards membership type thing. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"The Pumpkin Bowl is surprisingly so good! I like to add gojiberries to make it even more delicious. If you like cinnamon you will love this bowl."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice , the first time was amazing super friendly staff and great food . I came in again with my family and our food was brought to us in a to go bag . Said they were closing and we couldn't eat there, both paninis were put together sloppy , soggy and not cut in half . Was given the wrong size bowl . Super disappointed because the first time was a totally different experience. The guy that took our order was super nice , but not satisfied with the food ."}
{"text":"I hesitate giving a 3, but as almost everyone has said for some reason the customer service is really lacking here, especially when there is another bowl place less than a half a mile up the street. I really like their bowls and I'm a pretty picky açaí bowl eater. However, when I pay extra ($.75) for add ins I should get a little more than a swirl. But really why does it take so long when there are 3 people in the back making stuff? And to be told, \"just so you know the wait is at least 25 minutes\" before you order may not be the best wording to use to tell people your running way behind either. There may need to be some proper customer service language training done as well.   Now I go to Vitality 1. because it's close,  2. because I don't think they add liquid to their base, and 3. because I've met the owner he is very nice, is military and supports young adults of the military, but something needs to change.  I will drive the distance to another bowl place if I have to, great tasting bowls or not.  I'm not sure if the owner reads these reviews, but someone should.  4 less than 5 stars in the last 2 months isn't good. :("}
{"text":"The food was very fresh and delicious.  But having to wait 25min for a simple salad is just ridiculous. There were 8 other people sitting at tables waiting when I walked in and they all got their food 2 minutes before I did. Who knows how long they waited.   It's not worth returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Vitality Bowls is a great stop for an Acai bowl! They have a great variety on bowls. Been here a few times and each time I have left happy. Will be back soon with some clients!"}
{"text":"New Acai bowls so close to home!    THEY CARE ABOUT ALLERGIES! Finally a place that doesn't pre make their Acai blend. Great portions too. Brought my family the first time (they were visiting) so we got to try plenty of bowls.   The bowls are very, very good. I feel like I'm in Hawaii again . Interior is clean and there's plenty of seating.  -1 star for the staff member that rang us up. Also, the staff hangs out in the back until there's a guest ready to order. She didn't know much about recommending or suggesting additional toppings. I don't expect great service but at least to be treated like a normal human. They're not very welcoming...Also, you can hear them talk to each other. Very unprofessional conversations and they'll wait to finish talking to each other then go out and help customers. I know this because I was missing an item from my bowl and I had to wait for their conversation to end before they came out. Made eye contact with 3 of them more than 5 times. She proceeded to go to the back yelling \"who made the vitality bowl?!?\" Just please get me the topping that wasn't in my bowl.   -1 star for the music...kind of random. I feel like I'm in a Mexican love drama. Which is fine I guess? Sounds like they can listen to what they want until there's at least 5 consumers inside...then they'll change the music to something mainstream or what's supposed to be played?  -1 star for inconsistency. The guest in front of us and behind us got a coupon to come back. I didn't haha. The fourth guest got asked for a rewards program and I didn't. Would have signed up since I live 1 min away but maybe they're selective to who they ask.    Don't get my wrong by the rating, the bowls are super delicious and it's a cute place but unfortunately, the staff there really just ruined it for me. Maybe I'll take one to go next time to avoid the inconsistent staff."}
{"text":"Just great! Friendly staff, bowl choices are amazing best brunch to have on any day. Enjoy this is breakfast."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints! I come here time and time again. I am vegan and love having this as an eat out option. I highly recommend either of the dragon fruit options. The only thing I wish they had was more locations because this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Vitality is my first acai bowl experience EVER. Let me tell you, I am addicted. I was worried about the wait time, attitude etc. as other  people have complained about but really both times I only had to wait about 5 mins with a smile. Maybe the later in the day crew is more friendly?  My only complaint is that they close at 8pm, I usually get out of my exercise class at 7:45pm and I don't want to be THAT PERSON. But that's just me being a cry-baby.   They also offer groupon and yelp cash back."}
{"text":"I totally give this place an awesome 5 stars. Walked in, was very welcomed. I'm all about customer service. I'm not from around here, just visiting family. Charlie was really nice and helping me with options of smoothies and acai bowl since my brother said he wanted something with strawberries in it and basically all the smoothies had strawberry in it. I got the sunsation smoothie for my brother and a nutty bowl for me adding bee pollen to it. He told me it would be awhile because everything is made fresh to order which I totally don't mind if it's going to be quality over quantity. But overall, I took my first bite of the nutty bowl and it's pure deliciousness. Satisfying my pregnancy cravings! My brother also said he likes his smoothie so I'm sure I'll be back again before I leave!"}
{"text":"I don't recommend this location or maybe even the company as a whole. Today I waited 42 minutes for one acai Bowl. When I initially place my order with Rosa she told me it would be about 20 to 25 minutes. It is pretty ridiculous in my opinion to wait that long for this type of food item. I understand it's freshly made as they put it when I placed my order. But I do not recommend this place at all. It's absurd. After finally receiving my order all they had to say to me was \" here you go, thanks for your patience.\" I boycott this place. Service and the time it took to wait was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I had never even heard of an acai bowl until we visited Vegas last week and omg was I missing out. This place is awesome. We tried the warrior bowl, vitality bowl, graviola bowl, tropical bowl, and (my favorite) the nutty bowl. I also tried the tropical smoothie and the salad with goat cheese, strawberries and almonds (this would be even more awesome if it was goat cheese with walnuts and dates! just a recommendation ;) ). We went every day we were in Vegas and were very sad to leave it as we do not have one in Boston. The owner is super nice and I believe a veteran (support our veterans)! I can't wait to go back next time and try the dessert bowl and breakfast bowl. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"loved their bowls, juices and smoothies Wish the panini was a bit larger but tasted great Nice to have a healthy option in contrast to all the junk  nutrient deprived food that is easily available"}
{"text":"Best açaí bowl in Las Vegas! There are soooo many options but I think it might be impossible to choose the wrong one. I love this spot because I never have to wait long, the ingredients are always tasty and fresh, and I leave with a happy tummy. The serving sizes are generous and they don't skimp on toppings. Winning! The only down side are the prices but I've found the occasional indulgence to be worth it! Tip: add peanut butter to any of the açaí bowls that don't already have it."}
{"text":"I went in with my daughter because she's been wanting to check it out for a while now.   I wish I had checked it out sooner. This place is great. Goodness in every bite. We had the dragon bowl and it was so good!!!  We will definitely be back to try other things."}
{"text":"vitality bowl is good (8.99) and acai elixir smoothie is good. a little bland. it's not sweet.   BUT they r soo slow."}
{"text":"This was my first time going today and I will never go again. I came in before work to grab a panini and it took over 20 minutes, mind you they told me it would take about 10 minutes. Next I get my supposed to be veggie sandwich and it had meat in it! There was no sincere apology for having a non meat eater bite into a sandwich with meat.  Now I am late to work due to the 20 minutes and having to go back because there was meat in my sandwich."}
{"text":"I stood in the lobby waiting for 10 minutes as i watched 3 employees laugh and talk in the back then i asked for no ginger in my drink. There was then when i called to mention it the just denied there was ginger. I also got yelled at by my boss because what was suposed to me 10 to 15 minuet run for break turned into my lunch break because it took me 30 minuets. Also the smoothies were bland. Wouldnt recommend this location."}
{"text":"Amazing food, smoothies, and costumer service. Highly recommend trying this place! The owner is a great guy."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Not only is the food great but they totally listen to their customers. I had put in my previous review that I wished they had agave syrup as an option instead of honey and they totally made it happen! Awesome!"}
{"text":"4/4/18 updating review because customer service is crap now. Wasn't receiving loyalty points and repeatedly told several of the young ladies that work here. They look at me like I'm a bother and offered zero resolution or care. I heard other customers complain of the same problem. I later heard from another employee, young guy, that is the ONLY one that is ever any good that they are making sure everyone's trained properly. They weren't entering the loyalty number (your phone number) correctly. Tonight I asked if she wanted my number and she literally said \"you can just scan it yourself when the ticket comes out\" and again looked at me like I'm the problem here.   Same girl another time I was here was so rude to another customer that told her that the bowl wasn't made correctly. Again just stared at her like she was the problem. Didn't offer to fix, remake, refund, anything. I believe they were remaking the bowl but the girl never said a word until the lady started to get upset.    They are good but too expensive for such crap service and bad attitudes.   **********  I think the bowls are delicious but I also tend to like healthy simple foods. My husband isn't a fan of the bowls but likes the smoothies and juices. They have a pretty good variety of paninis, juices, açaí bowls, smoothies and a small kids menu. The grilled cheese panini on the kids menu is good and I'm always stealing a bite of my kids when they get it.   The food is a bit pricey , bowls are $10-$15 and juices are $6-$8. But the quality is great and I feel you get what you pay for.   The place is always clean, been here about 5 Times now, and never anything dirty or out of place. The staff are all extremely friendly and will gladly tell you their favorites from the menu or describe an item for you.   You may have to wait 5-10 mins but they are making everything fresh in the back.   I only give four stars because it seems too expensive but perhaps I'm not aware of the full cost of the products offered. I recommend coming here if you want something completely fresh and healthy. lol"}
{"text":"Looking for a good Açaí bowl? They have one of the biggest bowls in town with a large selection of options and fresh fruit not frozen stuff like some of the others. In my opinion the best in town! Tropical bowl is the usual."}
{"text":"I really like this place so far!! I ordered online through the grub hub app for pickup and everything went smoothly it was my first time so it was good.i forgot which smoothie I got but they were both delicious and filling I'll definitely want to try more on their menu. I want to try the food."}
{"text":"I've been a customer since they've opened and LOVE their bowls! However, over the past couple months, the quality/quantity has drastically changed. Initially, their bowls were full and well-worth the cost. As of late, the bowls are literally half full (see pics) and it's unacceptable. Also, the time it takes to make a bowl is ridiculous. I call 30 minutes in advance and I still have to wait 10 minutes when I arrive! The Centennial Hills location is MUCH better and I will continue going there, but, never again to Blue Diamond."}
{"text":"The acai bowls here are delicious! There's a wide selection of acai bowls and drinks to choose from, so be prepared to be overwhelmed. You'll be able to taste the difference between their acai bowls here and the ones they serve at Jamba Juice. Vitality Bowls uses fresh, healthy ingredients.They offer a small (one serving) and large size (two servings). You can always ask to split the large into two bowls for sharing.   Vitality bowls is conveniently located in the same plaza as TruFusion and Albertsons. I will definitely be back for a little pick me up after my classes at TruFusion. Also, if you happen to do some shopping  at Albertsons, there's usually a coupon on the back of the receipts with a $1 off coupon. Either that, or check in on Yelp for 10% off. For more rewards, sign up for their Loyalty program if you decide to become a frequent diner!"}
{"text":"The staff here is awesome. We are visiting and usually eat at the Brea, CA location. I was impressed with their attentiveness and friendliness. The store is spacious and comfortable."}
{"text":"Updating my review to 4 stars from 2 I don't know what my problem was on my first visit. These bowls are pretty darn good. Tonight I ordered a medium dragon bowl which was more than enough to satisfy my hunger. My only complaint was I got brain freeze from shoveling spoonfuls into mouth. Give them a try you will be happy I will be back soon to try their salads.   Thanks Scott"}
{"text":"The Acai bowls, smoothies and panini are quite yummy but unless you have 20-25 minutes to wait this may not be the best option.  The best way around the wait is to order before, online."}
{"text":"This place is a convenient area and has really good juices. I have not tried their bowls yet but they do look very good and filling. From the juices I think the prices are very fair. I got the intensifier multiple times and I've been very happy with it. If you tell them what you like they're more likely to help you out with options and also you can tell them if you want to add less or more of certain fruits or veggies for your juice in in case you don't like certain things."}
{"text":"This place is great!! Owner is nice and ensures you get what you need, top Quality produce and overall items on menu. If you want light or health, this is the place!"}
{"text":"If you are craving an acai bowl, this is the place for you!  I had a huge craving for one, so I decided to come check vitality bowl out. Absolutely loved it!  When we first walked in the first thought was how the establishment itself was extremely clean!  It made you want to stay and eat there.  They have a clear menu displayed above but also had menus for you to see close up.  The staff was extremely nice as well. A really nice gentlemen came around and asked how everything was to us and to everyone else that was in there eating and enjoying their bowls/food.  The acai bowl we ordered came in this awesome metal bowl!  The portion of acai, granola, and honey were all perfect.  I didn't' feel like there was too much acai and not enough granola or honey(which is usually the case for me).  This is definitely a place we will be going to again."}
{"text":"Fell in love this place ! It's so refreshing to have such a healthy option so close to home and work ! Amazing owner and awesome staff !  Plus they support the troops !"}
{"text":"This place is a def 10/10, everything takes awhile but it's all fresh and worth it! I've been here several times and they never fail to bring the best, the customer service and their workers are super nice and i recommend this place."}
{"text":"When in Vegas find something cool to eat. Their bowls are always good. My favorite is the nutty bowl. It packs 530 calories for a medium but it's super good and filling. I love that you can get it in a for here bowl to help reduce waste. They also serve paninis and breakfast and salads. Service is good and the price is pretty consistent with other places. Overall a great place for an açaí bowl."}
{"text":"Bowls are good, but WAY over priced. And you have to pay extra for toppings. I typically pay 8 bucks for an acai bowl at other places. But, their smoothies are very reasonably priced. So I'll probably be back for a smoothie instead."}
{"text":"After a long hot, early morning hike I needed to refuel....instead of hitting up my usual spots, Einstein bagel and Tropical smoothie....I  left it up to Yelp!  Now, I'm kicking back freezing my butt off -lol, and enjoying my Temptation smoothie with added peanut butter and almond milk instead of their standard nonfat milk, reading the menu and producing my thoughts... They have a great menu with variety of offerings.  You can choose from a selection of panini's, breakfast and desserts, salads, soups, Acai bowls, smoothies, a kids menu, coffee and kombucha-wow!  As for my final thoughts about the smoothie, it was very tasty, I'm a damn good smoothie maker as I make them nearly every morning before work. It tasted fresh and like something I would make at home, which is why I opted to give 4.5 stars instead of a solid  5... I I can't wait to come back and try more of their juices and smoothies!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! They split ours into two bowls for us when we were sharing!"}
{"text":"So far I've had the Tropical Bowl, Dragon Bowl, and Graviola Bowl. All within the last couple of days. You could say I'm obsessed. My favorite so far was the Tropical bowl! The graviola bowl was a little too tart for me. Will definitely be back to try the rest of them!"}
{"text":"This place made an awesome Acai bowl that was fresh and made to order with delicious ingredients! I was visiting for a work trip and wanted something light for breakfast and this spot hit the nail on the head! This will be a go to for me when in Vegas for work!"}
{"text":"Wow, I have stopped here before and just grabbed a menu.  Today I finally order something.  I got the Salami Panini!   Hunneeeee, let me tell you!  This ain't no kiddie Salami sandwich!  The reason, I got it, is because I've never seen a Salami sandwich on a menu before in my life!  but this is for grown folks!  At first I didn't think I was going to be wow'd  But the more I at, the better it got!  All the good stuff was in the middle.  It had peso on it (I usually don't care for Peso) Spinach, sundried tomatoes, cheese I had it on wheat bread! I was a little bit upset when it was gone!  It was divine!  When I'm in the area, I will be back."}
{"text":"Very good and healthy cafe! Came here for the 1st time and was very impressed of everything! Juices and food were great! Staff was very helpful on answering our questions about the menu, they also made us aware of their app which took $3 off of our meal! We ordered the Vitality Bowl, Roasted Turkey Panini and Grilled Cheese sandwich for our son and was amaze at them all! They were all very good! As for juices we ordered The Rehydrator and Intensifier and was also impressive! Definitely recommend this spot if you're looking for a healthy great meal"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. The acai bowls are really good. The first few times I went I didn't have a problem. The last couple times though, I've had to wait nearly 30 minutes for a BOWL! It's ridiculous that even when I call ahead I have to wait 20 minutes. The bowls are great, I haven't found a better BOWL anywhere tbh. But the customer service has just been horrible. Hopefully this issue can be resolved soon so I can keep on going back. But as of now I'm really disappointed in this place. If you don't mind waiting 30 minutes for a BOWL go ahead and try it but if not I highly recommend calling ahead of time."}
{"text":"Nice staff  .. I order a tropical acai bowl must say it's amazing best in town .. also order a raw juice ginger pineapple coconut amazing this is my new place to go"}
{"text":"First time having an acai bowl was a success. The vitality bowl was delicious. If you like fruit you will love this place. The owner/staff was very welcoming and helpful in selecting a bowl. I would highly recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"Guys, I just discovered (that I like) acai bowls! lol  Don't get me wrong, I've tried them before but, didn't seem to like them as I thought they were either too tart or too sweet.  But, they say your taste buds change every 7 years so, here I am ...obsessed with acai bowls!  Specifically their tropical acai bowl **drool** I was eating it at work once and dropped all best parts (I was saving for last) on the ground. Talk about bummer.  I've tried their dessert acai bowl and, shockingly, didn't care for it much despite my love of their choco chips in there. I like their vitality bowl, also. Good mix of things I like at a decent price compared to the other bowls.  The one thing that could use some upgrade is the service. Everyone is nice and friendly but, I swear, I wait longer than I should for these things. I even ordered through Yelp, ran some errands that took me 20 minutes and went to pick up my order to realize they didn't have it ready and I had to wait another 10 minutes for them to make it.  Whatever."}
{"text":"I had visited this place two weeks ago when I started going to TruFusion that is in the same plaza.   I was only able to buy their juice there, so I have to come back to REALLY try their stuff. I got the detoxifier juice which had ginger, cucumber, coconut juice, and lemon juice. I asked for extra ginger (+$1). It was so good! So good that I wanted to try to make my own rendition of it. Of course, it wasn't the same.   Asides from their juices, they also serve bowls, smoothies, kombucha, sandwiches and salads. I think the thing that really sticks out to me here is that they offer some rare and exotic fruits here--some of them I've never heard of. Those ones are supposed to be good for you, and I'm really excited to try their bowls with those exotic fruits.   + for having a reward system as well!  + for the good and tentative service from the owner"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but service was great and wait time wasn't bad either. Got the tropical bowl and loved it! I'm always on the search for a good açaí bowl and this one definitely hit my expectations! I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! I get the açaí kids bowl for a healthy snack and it is sooooo good - who needs ice cream when you can have this!!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best acai bowls in Vegas. My favorites are the Tropical Bowl and Nutty Bowl. Pretty good size for the price."}
{"text":"This is my 4th,time here  and every time it's a long wait. The staff is unorganized and never prepared. Will not come back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The first and original Vitality Bowl is in San Ramon and I first tried it when I lived up in the Bay Area for a little while. When I first saw that they were opening one here in Vegas and near where I live I just had to go and check this one out.   I was not disappointed upon trying this place out! Everything is made from fresh fruit and no additives. My gf and I have been here a couple times already since they have opened. Every time we have ordered they never forget any of our add-ons to our bowls and make their panini's fresh and served right from the press!   I usually order the \"Vitality Bowl\" as I do love acai bowls. Everywhere else I have been to in Vegas that emphasizes in acai bowls (fruits n roots, bowology, daily kitchen, etc) I would say this place tops all of them! I love that their menu has many different bowl options and they are also easily customizable. My bowl was made perfectly, especially in sweetness. It wasn't too sweet nor was it bland at all. We were never charged asking for extra honey either since I crave for extra sweetness sometimes!    Their staff is very friendly and we also met the owner Charlie. Him and his entire team are awesome! I have rarely ever met a local business with a team so caring and attentive. Especially seeing the owner setting a great example being there for his team, that is what I love to see! Thanks for your service Charlie and for giving us such great hospitality (:"}
{"text":"Great fresh food. It filled me up without giving me a bad feeling. Anytime you want to eat fresh and fill up I recommend taking a stop by. Also great customer service!"}
{"text":"I am so hooked! The bowls are delicious...and healthy. The owner is often working the register, and he is sweet, helpful and it is evident that he genuinely cares about his customers, his employees and his business. Vitality Bowls is my new go to..."}
{"text":"Such a cute little spot and I'm happy we have a place like this so close to southern highlands! I came in for lunch with my husband. We got the steak panini and the sunrise bowl. The sunrise bowl was to die for delicious- I might be able to live off of it. I loved it and loved that my husband and I could share it and still be satisfied because it was so much goodness! The reason I had to share with my husband though was because the steak panini was less than satisfactory. It was hard to take a bite of it without the entire piece of meat wanting to come with- just not enjoyable and not much flavor especially compared to the bowl we got. I am not going to hold this against them and I will definitely try again and more menu items."}
{"text":"Pros: Amazing acai bowls/juices with the option to add tons of nutrients Ingredients are super fresh  Cons: I wish there were more salad/sandwich choices There was a long black strand of hair in my bowl  =/"}
{"text":"I haven't even been to this location yet and I'm already giving it 5 stars. I'm from the town where vitality bowls originated and I have been a fan ever since and have been in Vegas for 3.5 years now just WAITING for it to expand out here. I'm gonna go get one today I'm so freaking happy! Nutty bowl all the way!"}
{"text":"Beside having delicious açaí bowls, smoothies, juices, and salads. The place is always clean and it has a great atmosphere, which it makes waiting for your made fresh and healthy meals a pleasure to wait for. I was there yesterday and I notice they even have a tv playing the latest movies on the background.  I had the temptation smoothie with peanut butter and without strawberries. Oh my! My fave! The nutty bowl is another fave of my.  The employees are friendly  and courteous with everything one.  I will most definitely keep going there."}
{"text":"I don't know what people are talking about with customer service, the customer services here was great. The vibe here was soothing. I love this place . And Daisy you ROCK..."}
{"text":"Always enjoy a treat from Vitality Bowls and it helps that I know it's healthy! I have a peanut allergy and they go above and beyond to take special precautions that my food isn't cross contaminated with any peanut product. It helps that if you check in on Yelp, you get 10% off! Definitely becoming a frequent customer here."}
{"text":"First, I have to say, that is one of the best acai bowls I have ever had.  The store is very nicely decorated and has a nice vibe.  The food and atmosphere are not the issue here.  As other reviewers have said, the customer service is lacking.  I ordered one Vitality Bowl this morning.  From when I walked in the door, to when I left with my food, took nearly 40 minutes. There were only 3 people in front of me when I ordered, and they got juice.  This should be a fast casual restaurant, like a Jamba Juice or Chipotle.  I do not understand how it can take so long to make a few items.   Also, their menu is absurd.  They have it displayed on two 50 or 60\" TVs and I can hardly read anything on there because there is so much text.  I think they need to go the In N Out route and simplify the menu.  Maybe that will improve their productivity.  I was absolutely shocked to see that this is a large franchise.  The way this store is being run, I thought for sure this was a small independent company."}
{"text":"The owner and the whole staff are awesome! They connect right away to their customers and are very welcoming. My son and I love the Acerola bowl and the Tropical Acai bowl. Great food + excellent customer service = loyal clients for life!"}
{"text":"Bowls were great, alitttle pricey but this seems to be the new trend with smoothie bowls. Toppings were delicious. Staff was very nice. Wait time was alittle long.  I don't know if I would go if it was really busy I would worry about the wait.  But a great healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Love this place so much!! Finally healthy options in our area! I highly recommend the Acai bowls. So delicious."}
{"text":"Good variety of acai bowls. They also have a dragonfruit/pitaya bowl, acerola bowl and graviola bowl for variety. I've tried both the acerola and graviola bowl and I really like them, particularly the Graviola bowl, minus the kale.  I also greatly appreciate that they have nutritional info on their website as well as on the menus in store.  Service is friendly and they have a loyalty program.  It's more expensive than other acai bowl places, but at the same time, the portions are huge, the medium sized regular bowls are enough for 2 people. I would love for them to introduce a small size for their regular bowls, I would come here more often if they had that."}
{"text":"This place is great. I had the opportunity to get some samples here. The grand opening is on 4/13, and they are passing out flyers with discounts! They serve smoothies, paninis, acai bowls, and salads. It is a healthy option in this great shopping center."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for! I love this place because of how much you get for the price! I tried this place because we had samples at work and I found the bowls to be refreshing and a great summer pick me up!   I returned a few months later to explore the menu and found the menu to be a wide variety of deliciousness! They have sandwiches, smoothies, juices, soups, salads, bowls! It was a great selection. I ended up just order an acai bowl and it was (I believe 20oz) for something around $11, which isn't bad at all!   I love the serving size to cost and I love the wide selection.   The only reason this review is only 4 stars is because the customer service could use some improvement. The cashier wasn't well informed about the menu and item availability. She wasn't familiar with the usage of the cashier system either. And the time between ordering and receiving your order is quite a long time. It needs some customer service improvements."}
{"text":"This was a very clean business and my daughter took me here after trying the food here I will definitely be coming back again it was really delicious and filling come check this place out if you are on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Every time I call ahead to place a take out order, they wait until I'm in the store to start making my food. The first incident, I was on the phone and placed on hold for eight minutes (by which time I arrived in store) to place my order. So I had to sit and wait an additional fifteen minutes for an order I wanted to pick up joins arrival.  This time? I placed my order 20 minutes before arriving. I show up, and I am told that my two bowls would take another ten minutes.... mind you, I'm writing this as the ONLY patron in the establishment. Management, please hire employees that don't get paid to twiddle their thumbs and waste my time.  UPDATE: Back today for a dine-in and there's no one at the register. We waited for six minutes and it took my calling the store for Rosa to come out of the kitchen to take my order. We listened to her gossiping with another staff member for the entirety of our wait. My panini arrived without apology... my friend's smoothie? Lumpy and took an additional fifteen minutes. Seriously... get new employees."}
{"text":"BS +  As a food nut I never tried Acai bowls.  I was a skeptic. But after coming here (I ordered the Warrior!) I was sold.  It's a bit pricey but you are buying healthy.  It's worth it.  It's so refreshing but SUPER SWEET.  I highly recommend this place as one of the healthier choices for desserts.  You can share the small with someone.  It's right off Blue Diamond.   All the health food nuts swear by this.  All the hipsters eat this and it gives them amazing hairlines and nice fitted pants.  So why not.  TRY THEM NOW!   Location is CLEAN, NICE, NEW Staff NOT FRIENDLY.  TOOK LONG TO MAKE OUR BOWLS Parking lot is SHARED and SMALL Restrooms CLEAN and FUNNY Seating is Nice and Clean Pricing is HIPSTER EXPENSIVE.  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. Room temperature water and carrot apple juice that was $7. I asked  if they had ice and the reply was only for the smoothies. The girl that took are order recommended a bowl that had peanut butter in it but when I came to the table there is no Peanut butter to be found. I asked and they said they forgot to put it on but it was the star of the dish! That's why I gave this place one star."}
{"text":"Amazing food! 100% worth the price. The staff are so polite, welcoming, and take a genuine interest in your interests and likes! Also, while reading through the other reviews complaining of time, they are making bowls, smoothies, paninis and juices with 100% fresh produce so of course it will take time, but it's worth it! Want something fast? Go to McDonald's. I'm sure their nutrition value is far superior... not."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with how much I loved this place, considering the fact that I usually go to all the overpriced fancy juice bars in town. This place had such a large variety of items on their menu that it was almost overwhelming to choose! So typically other juice places charge $9+ for smoothies that have like 5-6 basic ingredients in them, but I really appreciate that vitality bowls uses way more super nutrient dense ingredients for only $5-6. Along with that, they have salads, paninis, and their signature açaí bowls that I will definitely try the next time I visit."}
{"text":"No added ice and sugar! This place is amazing. I love how they blend their base with other fruits. Perfect for a mid day summer treat! Sorry no photos we devoured it before the camera came out"}
{"text":"I'm 100% a fan of Vitality Bowls! I first came on their grand opening, and like most grand openings, there were some kinks that needed to be worked on. They have since fixed those, and I can confidently say that there's no room for any complaints here.  I have had a couple of conversations with the owner, Charlie. He is always asking what he can do better. I can name a couple of owners that I've encountered on Yelp that were not so open to learning what their company needed help with. One thing I know for sure is that owners that are open to constructive criticism will never fail. For that reason, this place will continue to be successful.  In the month that Vitality Bowls has been open, I have been here at least once a week. I've only tried their bowls and so far, I like everything that I've tried. My current favorite is their Energy Bowl. I will continue to be a loyal customer here because of their yummy açaí bowls, great customer service, and their strive to always be better!"}
{"text":"They staff is super friendly and attentive and the food is awesome, but this is my third trip in and every single time I've waited at least 25 minutes for just a smoothie (tonight it was 30).  The quality is awesome, so I'll probably give it one more shot."}
{"text":"This is probably the best açaí bowl in Las Vegas. I got the nutty bowl and it was amazing. I'm pretty picky about açaí and I loved this one. They have a pretty big menu with a lot of options. They even serve things like paninis and salads if you don't want to get an açaí bowl.   Parking is simple - it's located in a large plaza so no troubles there. It does take a while for them to make the bowl, probably like 8-10 minutes, but that's because the food is prepared fresh. You can definitely taste the freshness. Service is quick and friendly.  I'll definitely be back, and I would recommend this location to anyone in Vegas looking for a little energy boost."}
{"text":"Pricey but totally worth the quality of food and exceptional service.  Swung by after yoga since it is in the same plaza and they offered a discount for being a member of Trufusion. $12 for a mediums acai bowl (seasonal Avocado bowl) but it was packed with premium ingredients and very filling. The owner who took my order was super friendly and informative and customized my bowl to my liking. He even followed me to my car to make sure they made it right which was very impressive. One suggestion, I wish they would offer a bowl in a smaller size for snack purposes. The medium bowl was quite filling and sometimes you just want something to snack on. One less star because it appears as if they are always understaffed therefore the food takes quite some time even when calling ahead."}
{"text":"Horrible! No one smiled there but that was fine. They might be tired or whatever. But we waited for our orders (only one acai bowl and one smoothie) over 15 mins so I asked them when it's gonna be done. They said 5 more mins. But 5 mins after, I still didn't get the order so we asked them again. They said there were long line. Bullshit! There was no line when we got in there. But finally I got my order. I opened it when I got home. I ordered nutty bowl but no strawberries and peanut butter in my bowl and I tried to call but no answer. What a horrible service!"}
{"text":"The idea of this place is great! Food and drinks are both really good. Lots of gluten free options and fresh products. But he prepared to wait! It takes forever to get an order and if there are orders in front of you.. forget it. They even have a sign posted that they will be slow. Hopefully they will work on their processes and speed up the service soon!"}
{"text":"All the acai bowls I've tried in the valley cannot compare to this place. I mean you can instantly taste the quality!! Only complaint I have is they don't have one on the west side because I would literally be here everyday!"}
{"text":"I ordered a plain ole acai bowl from Vitality Bowls online because I wanted to minimize the amount of time I left work for lunch. I went to go pick it up in person and arrived about 2 minutes before the time it said it would be ready as I only work a couple of minutes away. When I arrived there was only one person in line in front of me and I was very pleased as I was starving and in a hurry. The employee handling the customer had no idea what they were doing as it took them about 10 minutes to successfully get them out the door. At this point, I was in a huge rush so when they handed me the Acai bowl out the fridge I paid and quickly drove back to work. When I opened the bowl, the acai was a soup. It was completely watery and looked as though they made it 30 minutes ago. Extremely disappointed as I am obsessed with Acai Bowls and was hoping to have a new go-to place right next to work."}
{"text":"Great food. Healthy food made to taste great. Service and atmosphere is also good, including the music. Had the energy bowl and the C Me Up juice, both were great. It doesnt smell horrible either as \"healthy\" restaurants tend to. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Many choices. Looking for a healthy breakfast in Vegas is challenging! They have healthy breakfast and fresh juice! Acai bowls and smoothies."}
{"text":"I love love love this place.  Not sure what else to say.  Some places just slap the bowl together, but you can tell they take their time to make the presentation just as good as the taste.  It's a perfect healthy fresh treat.  And the juices aren't half bad either!"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times because this place is awesome. I got the Tropical Paradise smoothie and the Dragon bowl the first time I went and they are both definitely my favorites there. Everything is really fresh.   The owner Charlie is so nice and walked us through the menu. The menu is pretty big and there are a lot of options.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great tasting and healthy menu options. Large portions and kid friendly as well. Super nice staff who are very helpful to first timers. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a smoothie, it was really just ok. It wasn't out of this world or anything.. otherwise it's a cute spot with nice outdoor area close by for those who enjoy sitting outside.."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this spot. I was hoping for a healthier lighter breakfast and they definitely did not disappoint. Great presentation, we dined in. There were so many great choices it took me forever to decide. I will definitely visit this place again when I'm in town and need a good start to my day"}
{"text":"If you have acai, it won't be too long before I find you.  An equal opportunity acai bowl eater, I stopped by Vitality Bowls last weekend since I was in the area.  A hot, new business for the Mountain's Edge neighborhood, this is a great place to get your acai fix. The menu lists 10 different acai bowls, plus dessert and oatmeal bowls. You can also request gluten-free according to the menu.    I chose the small 20 oz. Vitality Bowl with acai, bananas, strawberries, flax seed, organic granola, goji berries, and honey.  Usually $8.99, Charlie the owner gave me $1 off since this was my first visit; he did this for another customer who came in after me, too!  I liked my acai bowl very much and the small size was more than enough for me.  I think the only things that were missing for me were coconut flakes.    Be sure to use your Yelp check-in offer of 15% off!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place out since I heard about it a few weeks ago while browsing Yelp. The menu is pretty extensive for acai bowls which I am a huge fan of. When I first entered it felt a bit awkward, there was a lot of people in the store and there was no music playing which would greatly impact the atmosphere in a positive way even at a low volume (update: while writing this I had been in restaurant about 15 mins and they started playing some country sounding music, think a more uptempo lounge/spa sound would fit the vibe better.. just an opinion). They offer cold brew coffee and kombucha on tap which I've personally never seen kombucha on tap before and I believe they offer different flavors at different times.  I placed my order to go and very unexpectedly the lady told me it will be 20-30 minutes which sounds quite crazy to me for two acai bowls. I understand they are made fresh on the spot but it's basically 20-30 minutes for a thick bowled smoothie with some toppings on it. They seemed kind of busy so 20 minutes seemed understandable, but 30 sounds crazy. At least I know and you now know for any future trips to vitality bowls. (Update it took exactly 22 minutes) The guy who brought out my order, who seemed like the owner was very nice and thanked me for my patience)  Anyway to the acai bowl itself, I got the tropical bowl.. and it was excellent! The actual blend was nice and thick and not the icey smoothie blend you get from some places. The bowl was not very sweet just kind of naturally sweet so you could tell there was no sugar added. My only negative on the bowl was that there didn't seem to be that much honey I added some at home which made it better. The granola was super fresh and very good. Bananas and strawberry's were perfectly ripe and the coconut shavings added that little extra that elevated the flavor nicely (i wish there was a little bit more coconut shavings. If you dig yourself an acai bowl go check this place out! The only reason for my 4 star rating is because of the long wait."}
{"text":"This is my new addiction lol, is like icecream but I eat it as a meal. I have being here only a few times but I really like all the options they have is really something for everyone here.  As a vegan I love that a lots of options alternative milks,  so I can be free to order with a concern of drinking real milk.  But in general give it a try something fresh and natural made at your order it takes a little bit but it is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food and staff are incredible!! The dessert bowl is my favorite!!! Jessica is always so friendly and welcoming as soon as I walk in."}
{"text":"Great spot for açaí bowls. The graviola bowl is one of my favs from this spot and the normal vitality bowls are always a solid choice. Presentation is excellent.   Pro Tip: If you know what you like, put in an order ahead of time for fast and easy pick up. When things are made to order, it can take a while. This will save you some time!"}
{"text":"Ight. The spoon scraping the metal bowl makes me cringe and also had that taste when I dig into the vitality bowl. Anyways, they got good stuff for a good price!"}
{"text":"Customer service - D, she didn't want to be bothered, rang in the items twice and was upset when I corrected her  Juice- D, I swear she put just straight lemon juice in my juice. I like the 5.99 price of the fresh juices, but wish it actually tasted good  Açaí bowl- delicious! We tried the vitality bowl and green bowl. My vitality bowl was soooo good!! But had hardly any granola. So order extra!"}
