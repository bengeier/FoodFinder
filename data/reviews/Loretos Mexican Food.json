{"text":"Awesome tacos, kind of a hidden gem. Great service, nice owners. Rice and beans on point, chips and salsa great; but the flan was amazing. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is one of those hole in the wall places you just have to try. The salsas were all so delicious and fresh. My husband is a picky eater and ordered the beef enchiladas and loved them. I had the crazy tacos which were the bomb! They had fried cheese, bacon, carne asada and all the toppings. You definitely have to try these! Delicioso!!!"}
{"text":"I was with a friend and we had planned to check out Arby's two sandwiches for $6.00 currently being advertised. But at the last minute my friend suggested this place saying she has gone here for years because of their excellent taco's. Big mistake! Seems Loreto's has a new owner and he is charging more than the posted prices. Only two other customers at 5 PM on a Tuesday evening should have been a clue. It was difficult getting our orders placed as the owner fumbled around and seemed unable to answer basic questions. When I got my Tostada and taco plate the rice was missing. The taco's had very little meat in them. Getting basic stuff like utensils and napkins was difficult. Waste of my money and I will not be back. Should have gone to Arby's!"}
{"text":"Excellent food that seems to be pretty authentic. Good prices too. Plenty of seating at this family operation."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Great service ! 4 different salsa! Chili relleno, Carne Asada, enchiladas, tortillas all so good and fresh- real Mexican food in a spotless small restaurant- thank you"}
{"text":"Went to Loretos for a late lunch one afternoon after reading good Yelp reviews.

The man at the counter (the owner?) was business friendly and clearly had pride in their food and ingredients.

He spoke with an accent and when I asked about how the meat was prepared--something was lost in the translation because he simply said all the meat was very good.

I decided to try a chicken burrito and asked what was in it and he said they could add beans and rice and so that's what I ordered--along with a refillable fountain drink.

I found a comfortable booth--and my meal came out very quickly. 

He was right--the chicken was cooked perfectly--moist and fresh--and I found several LARGE chunks of very tasty white chicken breast.

I wanted it \"hot\" so the man gave me several small containers of hot sauce he said they make there (and some dried crushed red peppers).  The sauces were all very good--but a small nit is that I would've liked a chunky salsa with tomato chunks in it.

BTW--He said they could add the sauces as the burrito was made but I wanted to add them myself.  Next time I'll have them added while the burrito is made though.

The restaurant is small but clean and has a homey feel to it--and my burrito was very good.

I definitely plan to go back.  

(Oh--he also told me they have $1 tacos on Tuesday and Thursday)"}
{"text":"Rice like Mama used to make!  Clean, friendly, with great fresh food.  You don't have to speak Spanish to order here, but the food is indeed authentic!  Tucked in a shopping plaza.  Might be hard to spot at first, but once you find it, you will keep coming back for more. We will!  Tried the tacos (since it was \"taco Tuesday\") and want to try the burritos and enchiladas next.  Owner says they have menudo and tamales during the holidays.  Looking forward to trying them also!"}
{"text":"Small business with excellent food! Salsa is good too! 

The owner greeted us, explained it was taco Tuesday. The tab was very affordable. 

My only criticism is the lack of beer. I personally need beer to crush a mountain of tacos."}
{"text":"Very good, unassuming Mexican restaurant. In at late lunchtime on a Friday, so no traffic. Quick service, fair prices, and excellent food. I had the shredded beef enchilada and burrito platter. Huge stuffed burrito, which was very tasty. Cheese enchilada also very tasty. 
Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Well is this place a pleasant surprise. Best crispy tacos I've had in AZ. Freshly fried taco shell and flavorful filling. Rice was fluffy, beans seasoned well. 

Great value too!  Will be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Not much more than your average Arizona Mexican food. The tacos were all right. They did put real lettuce and tomatoes in it, which is more than Filiberto's; but they were pretty small. The rice was dry and not much flavor. If you want a Filiberto's alternative for about the same price and quality, this is your place."}
{"text":"yeah..it's okay. Don't know if I will drive 20 minutes again to try the place. It wasn't WOW! But for the price of 3 crispy, beef tacos rice and beans on Tuesday it was ok. I was guided here from the other reviews that stated they got chips and salsa with their order. I wasn't offered or brought any. I did mention it to the gentleman who took my order, that I just saw you on Yelp and thought I'd try it. He shrugged his shoulders. When I mentioned I drove 20 minutes to get here, another shoulder shrug. I was the only person there on a Taco Tuesday. Convenient if you're close by, but won't go out of my way again, not 20 minute drive good!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I had the taco Tuesday special , 2 chicken and 1 beef. Crispy and full of stuffing! I also shared the quesadilla and that too was delicious. Will definitely be back to try other food!"}
{"text":"I tried out this place and I really liked it. The owner seemed really nice and easy to talk to. Had no problem with my order and my food was pretty good. Wait time was pretty reasonable and the place was clean for a small mom and pop shop. I went here having normal expectations and what do you know, they were met!"}
{"text":"Really nice staff. Family owned and operated. I had the California burrito and fish and my pops had the carnitas burrito. No complaints at all. They even give you free chips and salsa. Also they have $.99 tacos on Tuesdays and Thursday. Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"visited on a Thursday and had $1 tacos. Really good tacos for the price can't be $ 1. the place is a little small but it wasn't too busy so it was easy to find a table. we didn't get chips and salsa but I think you could buy them for a dollar, I think some people got them as part of their meal but they don't come with the $1 tacos."}
{"text":"Food is crazy authentic!!! Shrimp tacos, burritos and chimis were all on point. Salsa was great too. Everything was so yummy. Pozole on Fridays and Saturdays! Owner is so nice. Service was fast. Place is kind of hidden...its on the corner of shopping plaza towards Joann Fabrics side but keep looking to the right. Kids loved the food too!!!"}
{"text":"wow 
don't be fooled by the looks ! 
best carne asada tacos in the area . 
props to them
fierro"}
{"text":"First, agree with Juan E who left a review.   I'm guessing the man at the counter was the owner - he seems to not know what is going on.  It was kind of weird actually.   Little mom n pop places are kinda my thang so I stuck out the grueling order process.   
IMO food was not as good as others say it is.   Tacos were good, rice wasn't tasty and beans were salty.   My lunch companion ordered green chili.  The green chili didn't have any green chili in it or green chili flavor for all that matter.  It had bell peppers and bell pepper flavor.    
I won't go back."}
{"text":"Wondering how any of these great ratings got here. Just getting my order in was a major pain. I arrived on a Saturday at 12:30pm. Place was empty except for a table of two who seemed to be friends of the owner. You order from menu chalked on to wall. \"Owner\" (I am assuming) stood at counter in front of me making notes and steadfastly ignoring me while I waited. Finally I said, \"I'm ready to order when you are.\" He looked utterly shocked, shrugged his shoulders and pointed at a young (I mean REALLY YOUNG, like maybe 10?) boy who was sitting on a stool with his back against the wall munching on chips, also ignoring me and never saying a word or even looking at me as I stood at the counter. \"Well why didnt you say something to me?\" I asked the youngster. He stared at me and didnt respond. I was openly irritated.

I gave him my order but he apparently had no idea what to do on the register so \"owner\" poked around at it a bit and they agreed that it wasn't working, with junior rolling his eyes and throwing his hands up in the air, apparently absolved of his register duties. I said to \"owner\"  \"It's not working?\" No. Then he went back to his notes and the boy went back to his chips. I stood there at the counter in front of both of them waiting.. Was I supposed to just leave now?  I said to the boy \"Well, what am I supposed to do here? Can I get my order in?\" More awkward register poking from both and finally a receipt materialized. I signed and took a seat.

No help-yourself bar of anything at all, no chips, no salsa, no bottles of sauces. There were 2 salt shakers for the entire floor, sitting on random tables. Flatware was a joke. 3 knives and 2 forks were set out on the counter for service, at LUNCH TIME! 

I ordered a tostada and cheese enchilada combo (wasn't offered chips) so it came with refried beans and rice. The food was bland and average at best but the portions were generous.

The good news is that, at this rate, all this place is gonna need is 3 knives and 2 forks. I certainly wouldn't invest in a bottle of hot sauce."}
{"text":"I visited this small family business for the first time on this July 4. It is a small Mexican restaurant with the standard kinds of fare you'd expect , albeit cooked with some obvious family recipes. The father greeted me at the counter and his young son took my order. 

I wasn't super hungry so I ordered a carne asada burrito a la carte. It came with chips and I helped myself to a small salsa bar. The burrito was tasty and just right portion size. The son brought the food to my table. 

It was clearly a family enterprise, which I always like to support. I will return to try more of the menu another time, but my initial taste was positive."}
{"text":"Place had a bad smell. We got the $1 tacos and you get what you pay for. Very little meat inside. We each had 1 shredded Chicken and 1 shredded beef taco. We will not be back. Sorry!"}
{"text":"Perfect little lunch spot! This area needs more places like this! We ordered pretty standard stuff, but later heard about a Crazy taco? And the veggie taco, both are supposed to be amazing. We're going to order both next time we go. Everything was fresh and delicious. The place was clean and the family who run it are very friendly. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Little hole-in-the-wall with great food and service! Loreto brings you fresh salsa and chips while you wait for your order. So good!"}
{"text":"Haven't found better Mexican food in the area. Excellent food and their taco Tuesdays and Thursdays are really good for price."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  Wonderful family, and friendly service.  The guacamole was made to order, with exactly what we wanted mixed in. Every dish was absolutely yummy. Whole family approved. Everyone needs to visit this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken chimi great chips fresh and tasty good prices good service very quick"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!! My family orders from here every Tuesday and the prices are very reasonable.  We have also ordered party platters that fed at least 50 people.   Very small restaurant; however, the flavor is authentic and highly recommended.   We will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"The pluses were the speed of service with a great attitude. The salsa was so good I bought 3 containers to go. The negatives were the carne assada was tough and a little bland. Would stop back for salsa"}
{"text":"Just had the perfect size breakfast burrito.  Some places that do make you a gargantuan one but for $5.25 just can't beat the loretto's breakfast burrito which is bacon potatoes cheese and two eggs. 

Little salsa bar was awesome. Myself some varieties of salsa switch a very tasty not to hot... solid place to get your breakfast burrito. 

There's also a small bag of chips in the bag so it's nice to have the salsa and chips were hot and fresh"}
{"text":"Second visit is my LAST visit. This place had a connection with restaurant dot com and I figured I would use two of my vouchers on this restaurant. The first time I visited the owner acted like he didn't know what was going on. He gave me zero discount. He blamed me for not understanding. The thing is, the voucher was $10 for 20$. Basically a Groupon type deal. It's not rocket science. 

So I had another voucher for loretos on my restaurant dot com acct. I decided to give them one more chance. I present the voucher (on my phone). He says he doesn't know where that's from. 

Final decision. Everyone's hungry so we eat. 
I won't go back ever. The food was sub par, the service non-existent."}
{"text":"The \"Crazy Tacos\" with carnitas, avocado and bacon was amazingly good!  Service is friendly and fast. If you're looking for great food at good price...this is the place."}
{"text":"We decided to stop here based on reviews and glad we did.  It wasn't busy at all and the food was very good . It made us happy to support a local family rather then a big food chain.  Salsa was yummy and my cheese enchiladas were good as well."}
