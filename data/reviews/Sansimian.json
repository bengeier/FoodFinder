{"text":"Our go-to order is the oxtail with rice and peas. The oxtail is tender and the rice is really flavourful - especially when it's smothered with their delicious oxtail gravy. The tangy little side of homemade coleslaw is the perfect accompaniment. Tried their (huge) chicken roti today as well, and it was fantastic!"}

If you like Fried Chicken or Jerk Chicken, this IS your spot.  
Their jerk chicken isn't too spicy and always moist.  It is a huge hit so you might find they sold out if you show up after lunch and dinner hours.  
NOw for the big hit, the Fried Chicken.  This is by far one of my favourites of all time! Hands down Rose the house chef knows what she is doing.  They will have the option of adding BBQ sauce on your chicken, Do IT! I usually ask for half with and half without because I do find if I'm driving it home it gets a bit soggy with too much sauce. 

They only make their fried chicken Tuesday and Friday's****"}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall (in all honesty, it is one) but you're not here for dinner and a show, you're here for some great Jamaican food. Prepared by a crew of seasoned women, the food draws locals like a magnet. Oxtail, fry chicken, jerk, everyone has their own version, and these ladies dish out some great stuff. Jerk chicken is one of my go-to comfort foods. The only way this gets better is if it's cooked in an oil drum. And the rice and peas is fabulous as well.
Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Decent portions. It's a hole in the wall, a little on the dingy side, very small. This seems more like a place you go to pick up food then a place you go to eat.

Still, the food tastes good, and their food safety record is decent. Nice rice and peas, jerk chicken, oxtail and curry goat. I haven't tried the roti or the fried chicken, and they were out of ackee & sailfish when we visited."}
{"text":"This a little Jamaican mom and pops joints that no one really knows about because of the area that it is located in but it's definitely a diamond in the rough that should be shared with all.

I grew up in the area but I moved away along time ago but whenever I'm in the area I always stop by for their jerk chicken with rice and peas with oxtail gravy which is one of the better ones in the city. The chicken is moist and flavourful and the rice peas is also very moist and tasty with oxtail gravy. I find that a lot of places that serve jerk chicken/pork in the city to be too dry, along with the rice and peas. They also make a mean oxtail!

FYI: If your going their for the jerk chicken try to make it during lunch hours because for some odd reason, the places usually sells out by 2pm which is a good sign for the ones that get there early."}
{"text":"Goat roti and jerk chicken on my first visit. I will be coming back many, many times."}
{"text":"My co-worker said every Tuesday and Friday, they have fried chicken.  He said it's only available on those days and apparently it's the best.  When we went, they sold out already, granted it was already 8:30pm and their sign said they close at 8pm.  I'm just thankful to get food!  We got the oxtail and peas and it was filling and tasty.  

The place itself is small, very mom and pops feel, which is cool.  They have a couple of tables on the side of the wall and it's cash only (according to my friend.  I didn't actually verify).

The only meal that's above $10 is the oxtail, which is $11.75.  Pretty good place.  I'd come back here again."}
{"text":"This is the best Jamaican food in the city. Everytime I eat at another Jamaican place I always say \"It's good but it ain't no Sansimian\".

It's a hole in the wall kind of place and the decor is non existent. There's 1 table with two chairs for eating. Basically don't bring your first date here. Save Sansimian for later when they're sleeping over and you grab something from Sansimian and bring it back and blow them away. Then after they've sucked the last bit of meat off their jerk chicken bone. They turn to you and say \"I love you,\" and you say \"Pffft, you don't love me, you just love my take-out.\"

Jerk chicken is great. It straddles the line between wet and dry perfectly. The rice and peas are done right, I like mix the coleslaw into it.

White people like me usually go for jerk chicken when they go for Jamaican food because it's safe. Who doesn't like chicken?

You need to try other items on the menu here. You need to try their soups. They have a different soup of the day every day and every one of them I've tried feels like its renewing my life force. If you have to travel through a blizzard to get the medicine to the children, eat Sansimian's soup before you go. You'll make it.

Their curry chicken with rice and peas is exactly what I wanted when I ordered it. Stewy and thick and spicy but not over powering.

Most places oxtail is expensive and Sansimian is no exception to this. However at Sansimian the oxtail is actually worth the price because it's done right.

Finally the fried chicken. You'll see other reviews talking about the fried chicken at Sansimian and  there's a reason for this.

It's because the chicken is the fried chicken your mother never made. Their fried chicken is so powerful when you eat it you'll remember a childhood you should have had where your mom would effortlessly made this chicken instead of drinking and yelling all the time.

It's a homemade style fried chicken, made with love. Then they squirt a little bit a BBQ sauce on top. The sauce is perfect with the chicken and you realize \"Oh my god, they only do fried chicken Tuesdays and Fridays. How am I going to arrange my schedule and life around this?\""}
{"text":"This little mom and mom shop is the best!! I've been coming here for 20yrs now and especially love on Friday's the fried chicken with coleslaw and rice and peas.  $6.00 for a 3pc meal.  The two older ladies sure know how to cook that's for sure!  LOVE IT!!"}
