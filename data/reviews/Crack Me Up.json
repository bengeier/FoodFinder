{"text":"Absolutely incredible service and great food with it. I'm a huge fan of the different types of pancakes, and love the cozy atmosphere. The food is very affordable and the waitresses are very polite. I always feel welcomed here for brunches."}
{"text":"Came here after working out with a couple of friends. We walked in and a waitress asked us to to take a seat wherever we wanted. We sat down for 5 minutes before our waitress came by with menus. Waited another 10 minutes for our waitress to come take our orders.   Two of us ordered the \"Big Breakfast\" with a large chocolate milk and my other friend ordered the \"Eggs Benedict with Bacon\" and he got bottomless coffee. We got our drinks 10 minuted later.   You would think for a breakfast place food will be coming out withing 10 minutes. Nope. It took almost 45 minutes for our food to come. Another 20 minutes after for our waitress to come refill my friends bottomless coffee.   Needless to say, the food was just...blah. There were black burnt bits on my pancakes. The bacon was chewy. The eggs were overcooked. It was not what I was looking for and definitely not a location that I will go back to for breakfast any time soon."}
{"text":"The stove area is dirty a lot  When asked to clean it up the pretend the did not understand . Was so happy a breakfast place was coming to the neighborhood.  DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"This is an all day breakfast place, that now serves lunch and dinner as well.  It's affordable, not the most exciting place, but the foods not half bad.  Crack Me Up also has take out now, so that's a good thing.  All I can say is, try the place for yourself, and decide whether you like it or not!!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was terrible.   The lone waitress spent the entire time sitting and talking with her friend while the cook did all the work. The waitress didn't notice when customers needed help nor did she clear any tables that were full of dirty dishes. The waitress then told the cook that she would be back and left with her friend.  The cook however was super friendly so props to him. The 3 stars go to him and his efforts."}
{"text":"Been here several times.  Hit or miss every time  The breakfasts are good and a lot of food.   Fish and chips are sparse for what you pay.  A lot of batter with over done paper thin fish.  The coleslaw is not worth writing home about  Service is slow.  Too much chatting   Nothing more to say"}
{"text":"Came in for some breakfast after a fun night before, cause we didn't really feel like cooking and we wanted to be full for going shopping! Their menu is a great selection of breakfasts, lunches and dinners. It all comes down to what time of the day it is for you and want you need in order to fuel the furnace. I had the club and my wife had sausage/eggs, both come with homefries, but we opted for fries&gravy. Which unfortunately were over done, bummer, but the rest was great! Coffee's always fresh and service is sometimes on the ball and other times absent, the memory of the wait staff, I mean! If you're looking for a good place to stop into for some grub, this is the place, it's never crazy busy, but always steady. Bathrooms are clean and respectable, not scary! Try it out!"}
{"text":"Slow service and sub-par traditional breakfast food. I stopped by this mall-based breakfast restaurant after a workout for some quick lunch with friends and waited over 45 minutes from ordering until my food arrived. For simple greasy flat top grill food that amount of time is pretty inexcusable. Also, they needed to work the grill a little better: there were burnt black bits of food stuck to our pancakes.  Nothibg at all about the food stood out. Things were made decently if greasy. The hollandaise sauce on the eggs Benedict tasted packaged and the pancakes were chewy and overdone.  Service was slow. Only one coffee refill in an hour and a half and the post-food delivery checkup didn't happen until we were pretty much done.  Decor is aged and falling apart. Washroom was pretty disgusting. Won't come again."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to this new local breakfast restaurant. Unfortunately we never actually got the opportunity to eat there.  Our group walked in, and right away the waitress was very confrontational. We seated ourselves, because she couldn't be bothered to seat us.  She was very rude and abrupt, so much so that we ended up walking out of the restaurant before placing any orders.   This experience has put a very sour taste in my mouth, and I will be sure to relay the message to all my friends and family in the area.   I honestly feel bad for the owners of this establishment. They have permanently lost a large group of customers because of one very bad experience with a rude employee."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with this breakfast place. I generally never really liked breakfast places since I'm often disappointed by the likes of Eggsmart and Cora's but I did end up liking this place which definitely says something about it! It has a pretty large menu for a breakfast joint with options like french toast, waffles, variety of omelettes and even entrees like pasta and desserts like bread pudding and baklava! I ordered the waffle with fruit and portion wise it was kinda small but the waffle was really nice and fluffy. Could have been more generous with fruit though. On the other hand my friend got the veggie omelette which was a very generous portion that came with toast, home fries (NOT dense but light and crisp, which was nice) and a single slice of honeydew despite giving the impression that it would have more than one piece of fruit. The omelet and the waffle were actually about the same price (6.99/7.99) so my advice is to skip the waffle not that worth it. Also waitress was polite but not that attentive. Distracted by a friend that was sitting in the restaurant. Not once was my water glass filled, and I came from playing badminton so I definitely noticed my empty glass.   Overall, more like a 3.5 with things like fruit stinginess and waitress inattentiveness dragging the rating down. Good option for good breakfast food though!"}
{"text":"Slowest service I have ever had at a restaurant, it took almost 45 minutes for our food to come out. After we finished eating, I had to call the restaurant, while sitting inside of it already, to get the waitress to come to our table with the check."}
{"text":"Breakfast service is friendly and quick.   Food comes hot and the coffee never has a chance to be finished...our server refilled constantly and we loved it!  Its conveniently located at parkway mall and has clean comfortable booths and tables with televisions located everywhere so we can watch our fav...CP 24!  Lol  walk in here and you will be greeted with a genuine good morning and a smiling server."}
{"text":"Parkway mall location was closed, despite being closed March 27, 2017 (according to the lease termination on their door)"}
{"text":"Located inside a mall, this place has its own seating area apart from the fast food area.  The prices are reasonable in general and is even more attractive considering that it is in a private area.  You get the restaurant feel and can escape the hustle and bustle of the mall.  I really enjoy the food here! I was looking for a hamburger and fries, and the line up for A&W was long (they're really slow in this mall).  Great choice to come here!!! Homestyle taste, large burger with all the toppings, tasty bread, tasty meat, tasty toppings.  I saw the fries freshly cooked then seasoned with some reddish seasoning.  Added some salt to it.    Burger and fries costs $6.99 plus HST. Cheese and Bacon would add 99cents each.  You can also get french vanilla and other coffee.  I definitely recommend this place for the burger and fries."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast restaurant I've been to. The home fries are not greasy."}
{"text":"I coming a little more often now, as it is on my route to work plus I love a good breakfast at a great price!   The food here is nothing special, then again I feel that it is not hard to make breakfast or at least it should not be! I usually get the early bird special which I think is a great deal at $4.99. I do know that the rest of the food is not really the greatest here; this is why I usually stick with the regular breakfast. There is no reason to order anything fancy, plus I tried the omelette, pancakes, burger and fries, and the poutine - lets just say there are better places to get this not to far away.   Please remember that this is Malvern, there is not culinary explosion happening here! If one was to start it would not be here. All the food available in this area are mom and pop shops with an owner operator, which either makes it good quality and or poor service! This place is not my first choice but it's not bad either."}
{"text":"An okay place for breakfast. Will only go there if desperate. Food is bland and dry. There is better options in that area."}
{"text":"Found the name exciting , went for brunch ordered club sandwich n meat lovers scrambler. Food was Average ! It's a great place great staff but they need to improve quality of good !"}
{"text":"If I'm crqving brunch and too lazy to make it at home I would probably go back here. Wasn't a great first visit. Place wasn't busy, tables were dirty, washroom the same. Food took too long.   Ordered the salmon eggs benedict and hubby ordered the Philadelphia steak sandwich with side Greek salad. The sandwich was mediocre as well as the salad. I can make a better eggs benedict including a way better hollandaise sauce. Home fries were decent.   Overall a 2.5-3 stars. Maybe it'll be better next time I visit....if I ever do."}
{"text":"Slow service, cold food, only partially completed order.  The all day breakfast came with a promise of 'pancakes to follow' - well they never followed but I was still expected to pay for them."}
{"text":"I would normally give this place a four star (as it is just a normal breakfast diner) but the Scottish waitress bumped it up to the 5.   Immediately you feel like family.  Definitely worth the breakfast trek. Affordable and relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Lets start off by saying that the pancakes were bad. It wasn't fluffy like pancakes should be, it was dry and flavourless and it was burnt a bit. The whipped creme was disgusting. The cheese omlette was so nasty and watery. At first I was so happy that a breakfast joint opened up in Malvern, but I'm unimpressed. I wont waste my money going there again. Go to Panagios at M'Cwn and Shpprd. Lastly, the lady that was at cash was very friendly and polite."}
{"text":"I went in for breakfast this week and ordered the Belgian waffle. When I took a bite, I realized the whole bottom side was burnt. When I brought this to the attention of the very friendly waitress, she immediately apologized and said she'd bring another. After approximately half an hour had passed between sitting down and receiving my second waffle, I discovered it too was burnt. Rather than repeating the fiasco a third time, I ordered the breakfast special with crispy bacon. When it arrived the bacon was anything but crisp, it was greasy and not well cooked. Obviously a problem with their short order cook. I shall not be returning."}
{"text":"Not perfection this time but still tasty. The eggs benedict didn't ooze the precious yolk like it's supposed to; overcooked but still velvety.  Seemed like less fries this time as well. Their signature $5 breakfast has changed to reflect 10 a.m. instead of 11 a.m. Monday to Friday."}
