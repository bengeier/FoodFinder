{"text":"Cocktails and service were good but the food was awful (some dishes were super salty but the one that oddly not salty was the chorizo). Over priced. We usually love little trendy spots like this. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, wine and drink list.

The food is on point and very fresh.  Chef TJ and Esther are awesome."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and wine and decor and music pairing. Superb service. The best meal I've had to date."}
{"text":"Unpaid review from a real human being. 

It's worth noting that this restaurant is out of character for Melrose, and the \"$$\" price designation is inaccurate. The neighborhood and casual description sets expectations a little different from reality - a few \"small plates\" for two plus a cocktail and beer each ran about $200 before the tip. 

Thick pretension pervades... (Server: \"Your eggs were poached at 140 degrees.\") and they play the ambiguous portion game where they aim to make you feel cheap for asking, and will give an unclear answer if you do. 

Food was great."}
{"text":"My friend and checked out this place last night. We both really enjoyed our experience. I loved the open kitchen and the vintage atmosphere. I had the red blend with the poached egg and then Bluefin crudo. My friend had the sauvignon blanc with the kale salad and the poached egg as well. Getting the two small palates was fairly filling. 

I cannot STRESS enough how much you need to get to poached egg if you go! It comes with a flavorful, rich both, carrots, mushrooms, and this macadamia nut purée greatness. I will probably order it every time I go!  I highly recommend it and so does my friend! 

I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!  Celebrated our anniversary here last night and we are still talking about our meal and service.  While the menu is small, it is well conceived and preparation is very good.  We had the beef carpaccio (each order prepared immediately before serving) and scallop crudo as appetizers.  Both exceptional.  For entrees, we had the lamb loin and the chicken and dumplings.  Again, both perfectly prepared.  The wait-person was friendly, professional and very knowledgeable of the menu.  Hope this place continues its commitment to excellence and will be around for years to come."}
{"text":"I've been to Restaurant Progress twice since it opened and both times had a great experience. The first time we stopped in for drinks and tried a few items from the bar menu, burrata, blue corn fritters, and beet salad. It was perfect. The second time my wife and I shared the 5 course chef's choice meal and the tenderloin as well. We were surprised at how much food it was. I don't have the skill with words that the chef has with food so there's no way that I can do it justice. Just try it!"}
{"text":"The reality of the place is far different from the hype.  I t is hard for me to believe the reviews were written by customers.  When we arrived we were greeted warmly.  We came at 5:30 and walked into an empty restaurant, but the host needed to check the \"reservations\" to see if they could take us, they could, and interestingly enough, by the time we left at around 6:30, only one couple had come in. 
My salad was delicious but the rest of the meal was ok but certainly not exceptional.  My pork tenderloin was WAY over salted and a little too rare.  My friend liked her meal but we both agreed we would not go back."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with my BF and in laws and each got a different item on the brunch menu, Pork chops and gravy, probably the best and most $$$, banana  bacon french toast, french eggs and I got the basic eggs potatoes toast and bacon, all were very good, I liked the fresh herbs , flaked salt and homemade jam. We also washed everything down with a potent Carrot rum drink, and I got an orange blossom bill, the only neg was its better to go in paired and not with a small group due to the size and space. Also since the door is open all the time there were lots of flies coming in and out .  Good addition to the Melrose strip."}
{"text":"This spot is amazing! Incredibly intimate atmosphere with great music. The food is some of the best in Phoenix. The scallop crudo and soy cured watermelon are fantastic. Well done chef!"}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to be invited to a dinner at Progress a few weeks back during my visit for the Phoenix Open. I can't say enough great things about this place from the atmosphere to the food to the cocktails......especially the cocktails, and I strongly suggest the Old Fashioned.  As for the food, we were fortunate enough to get a tasting of most items, and they were all excellent.....especially the crudo and steak, which was amazing to say the least.  I'm lucky enough to visit Phoenix a number of times throughout the year, and I will definitely be returning to Progress on my next trip."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Can't speak highly enough of the food. It was simply delicious!! The service was so wonderful. Loved the place so much that I've been back twice in less than a week. :-)"}
{"text":"This spot transports you to a seemingly magical little hideaway. From the beautifully creative menu to the softly glowing space itself with it's charming ivy covered patio in the back, everything is imaginative and well executed. On the logistics side, the staff were friendly and attentive, the meal was delightful (yellowtail crudo was my favorite dish of the night!) the portions were just right, and don't get me started on my scotch based cocktail... okay, cocktails!"}
{"text":"Progress is definitely progress for PHX.  Give it up for a restaurant doing food and not a \"Concept\".  And the food is very, very good.  Went with 3 other people and we did the tasting menu.  Their method for serving the tasting menu is to bring each person at the table a selection from the appropriate section of the menu - so 4 unique meals, but the opportunity to taste nearly everything on the menu if you have enough people and they are willing to share.  Highlights were the scallop crudo, carrots and waygu, but there was nothing to complain about with all the other dishes.  Nice drink menu and good wine by the glass options.  Pretty room and good service.  I am a fan and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. I highly recommend going here. We looked over the menu and couldn't decide what to get cause it all looked good. With about 12-13 items on the menu we decided to order one of everything and it was well worth every penny. The taste, presentation, and overall quality of the food was on point. Cocktails were unique and had great flavor, and they have a spectrum of beer/wine to choose from to make everybody happy. The owners/creators of the place started from scratch and have done an excellent job with the design/feel of the place. They made the overall experience exceptional and I look forward to going back and seeing what's on the menu next time we come here. Cheers to restaurant progress and the people who make this place so good!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, one of the most excellent dining experiences I've had all around. Chef TJ Culp has really established something special with Restaurant Progress. We chose to \"Leave it to the Chefs\" and be completely surprised by a 5 course meal of the chefs choice. Before I mention the food, I think the most impressive part of our experience was that our plates, as well as everyone else's in the restaurant, was prepared by TJ himself, and his guest Chef, Christopher Carl. They worked together so harmoniously and carefully to prepare each dish. Most definitely an excellent team.  (Also super cool, you can see the chefs making everything right in front of you!) So many unique and extraordinary flavors that fit together so well. To name a few, roasted chicken thigh, New York strip steak, an unbelievable mushroom, carrot and poached egg dish and so many more tastes that really were unparalleled to anything I've ever had. Besides the food being so amazing, our waitress, manager and bartender were kind and knowledgeable, ensuring we knew everything about the dish, down to the way each item was prepared. All in all, we were provided such an intimate dining experience that was incomparable to anything else. There is no doubt in my mind that this place will explode with success."}
{"text":"The restaurant is well decorated and somewhat trendy looking.  The service at progress was pretty incredible, which is why I gave them two stars.  The food on the other hand was a roll of the dice and questionable.  We started off with multiple Gnocchi appetizers which were amazing.  I seriously scraped the plate until there was nothing left, it was so tasty.  I got the quail as my entree, it was cooked perfectly and the presentation was really nice.  I took my first bite and all I tasted was salt, so much salt.  Oh my god, why is there so much salt on my dish?  Do the chefs smoke that much where they can't taste it?  I never send my food back, but I felt this was not edible.  I told the waitress and she fix the problem by saying they would remake it.  Under 10 minutes later they served another quail, unfortunately it looked and tasted burnt.  I spent the first 5 minutes shaving off the large amounts of charcoal bits off the bottom of the quail.  Which didn't help much, because the entire thing tasted like I was eating charcoal.  It seems like they were in a rush to get the second order to me as quickly as possible, which I appreciate.  I just wish they had payed more attention to the cook time.  My wife got the scallops, which were also heavy on the salt.  But I don't think it bothered her enough to say something.  There were these strange inedible flowers  in her dish, which didn't serve any purpose at all.  Maybe the chef thought it looked fancy?  I don't know, it was a bit odd and unnecessary.  I mean if you're going to a fancy place where you're easily dropping $75-$100 bucks a person, you shouldn't have items in your food that you either can't or are not pleasant to eat.  My mother and father in-law was kind of a mixed bag, he loved his meal and she made faces at hers.  So, I'm guessing she wasn't thrilled with hers.  Everyone got dessert but me, at that point I didn't see the point after my meal was so bad the second time around.  My in-laws got a carrot and chocolate cake.  The carrot cake was okay, it was moist, no complaints.  The chocolate seemed fine until you ate the strange baking health chocolate on the top of the cake.  It was not very good, kind of tasted like you were eating rubber.  My wife got some kind of lemon tart thing with champagne jelly and goat whipped cream.  Which was really tasty and I would love to have again.  My wife had tried chef Tj Culp pop up restaurant and really enjoyed it.  We were expecting more of the same, but it fell short.  After a $250 bill, I expected better tasting food and a restaurant thats not trying so hard to get a michelin star.  Keep it simple, be consistent."}
{"text":"Incredible meal! The food was extremely creative and approachable. The staff was just attentive enough, never hovering but always available. And the atmosphere was adorable. Definitely a must when you are in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place prior to coming, and it's very tiny and easy to miss. But well worth the trip.

Did the tasting menu (vegetarian style), which is limited, and extremely limited if you don't eat seafood. But when you make a butternut squash as amazing as they do here, there's no need for any other entree.  The pasta the butternut squash filling is wrapped with is home made, as is the filling. It's served with a light brown butter sauce and I'm drooling as I describe it...I would come back here every day for this course.

Coming in at a close second is the cauliflower...Idk what the sauce is that they serve in the dish, but I don't remember having had anything like this before, again something I would come back for again and again...it was even delicious as leftovers the next day. 

I had never had sea bass prior to this evening and was a little nervous...not sure why because this was absolutely fantastic. It came either pan seared or blackened, it had a nice, crispy brown crust, but was moist and delicious all the way through. Not an expert, but I'd have to say that was cooked to perfection.

The presentation of this menu is stunning. The colors are vibrant, the food is fresh and warm, the service was second to none, and the setting is very classy. 

The tasting menu is normally $75, but they gave us a discount of $65 since we did vegetarian. An extremely reasonable price for food of this caliber. 

I assume the pumpkin squash tortelli are seasonal so hurry and go here before the menu changes!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner at Restaurant Progress this week, what an excellent find! We all sat at the bar top and had an amazing meal. The radish salad to start was amazing and then the orange Duck was also terrific. My wife had pasta and she is Italian American and she said was some of the best she's ever had and the same for her sister who had the Flat Iron steak and said was one of the best steaks she has ever had. 

The kitchen is amazing, it's smaller than our kitchen at home (and is essentinally right behind the bar and totally open in the restaurant) and how they have 4 people working in that space and turning out such incredible food is amazing and fun to sit and watch."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere, service, and bartender!  The food was absolutely amazing!  Small menu, done VERY well!  We got one of each of the entrees and each one was better than the next!  The vegetarian option was very good as well!"}
{"text":"Hands down...amazing. We both ordered the 5 course menu and we didn't have a bad thing on it.  We also did the wine paring and it was on point!  Come hungry and prepare to drop some money but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I had brunch and it was way over priced and the food was just fair. They would not let us sit at a table due to there only being 3 of us, for a table that had 4 chairs which was odd, so we had to sit at the bar. The service was not very good, the atmosphere was nice and cute though. I will not go back, which is sad since I live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"What an incredible treat! My husband and I came to Phoenix from LA for spring training and had read rave reviews about Progress. It was even better than we had expected! The back patio is beautiful and serene with a great sound system (and playlist!) We shared the pork belly dish to start and then had the quail and duck. It was all amazing! Our server Sid was friendly, gracious and knowledgeable and the hostesses were welcoming as well. All in all, a wonderful welcome to Phoenix and an experience everyone should try!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Progress is a go to spot for me and my husband. It is chef driven and has some of our favorite cocktails. There aren't many places in the Phoenix area that can produce dishes executed to the level that TJ his team does. Progress is a treat for those of us that are looking for a little more creativity and a more authentic experience in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Progress is impossible without change, their seasonal menu has never disappointed my tastebuds. The cocktails has always been a delight then there's the ambiance because whoever manages their playlist needs a raise."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in a long time. We tried a couple of the small plates for appetizers, and one being a crab/egg/avocado combo and the other and mushroom and chicken lover dish. They were absolutely phenomenal and I can't stop thinking about them. For our entree we got the beef cheek, and every component was perfection. Our bartender Jason served up fantastic cocktails that we loved. We're already planning our next trip so we can eat these dishes again before the menu changes. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The rustic space is cool with soft lighting. Has a hipster Seattle/San Francisco vibe with the pretentiousness that comes with that. Everything was extremely expensive. $8 each for a bottled craft beer; the entrées were small and well over $20 each. The medium and small plates (curried carrots, lettuce wedge salad, poached egg, etc.) were around $13. No thanks. 
The chicken and dumplings was mostly gooey and tasteless gnocchi, extremely salty, and overall very bland--like something that would have been served in my junior-high cafeteria. The \"chicken-fried trout\" was like a large fish stick on a pile of flavorless beans and rice with something green and leafy thrown over the top. 
The meal was nothing special and definitely budget-busting. The restaurant is very small (it probably seats around 40 people inside), and on a Friday evening had several empty tables! I want places like this to succeed, but with so many great (and much less expensive) restaurants in Phoenix, this was definitely a one-and-done unless they revamp their limited menu and improve their food."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a small group. The service was great, we had out water cups refilled promptly and often! They keep the menu small but there is everything you could want there. I had the French breakfast and it was AMAZING! They were gracious enough to accommodate my request with my meal. I had a bite of the croque madame and the pork chop. SO GOOD! I came all the way from Tucson about reading about this place in Tucson Lifestyle. Did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food, the atmosphere, the service and how they make you feel warn, welcomed and special. Cannot recommend Restaurant Progress enough. A true culinary dining experience."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE!!!! My boyfriend and I dined here in early February and it was perfection. The food and service were top notch. On site parking is very limited (we had to park down the street), but the ambiance of this beautiful spot made up for it. Highly recommend for a Date Night!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  The prices are on the higher end, but well worth it.  The service is impeccable, timely and friendly all around.  The food is outstanding and the cocktails are unique and delicious.  The first time I went in October 2017 the vegetarian items on the menu did not get me overly excited, but when they I tried them I LOVED them.  Everything that I was skeptical of ordering I absolutely loved.  Thankfully, I've been able to able to return a few times since and have enjoyed every experience.  Do yourself a favor and go here.   Make a reso first since it's small or sit at the bar.  It will be a wonderful experience either way."}
{"text":"We are from Chicago and are visiting. Chicago has a lot of good restaurants but this restaurant is by far a five-star the food is unique it is delicious well presented this is a hotspot for the greater Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Excellent food at a tucked away spot. We have been here 3 times now and it has been great every time. It's a small space, so I would definitely recommend reservations if you think of it in advance. Very current as far as decor, and very comfortable. Love the service, both friendly and efficient. The staff is very knowledgeable of the ever changing menu. The menu is small but changes regularly, so you'll never get bored. This time we were there with 4 total so we actually ordered one of everything on the menu. There wasn't a single thing that we didn't like. The carpaccio and the duck breast were a couple of favorites. Of course we tried all of the cocktails as well. They did an excellent job of making cocktails that were refreshing for summer, but not overly sweet. I would also recommend trying one of the dessert cocktails, different from anything else I've had. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very excited to have this restaurant in the neighborhood. The food was excellent. I had the scallops and they were delicious. It's a really cute little place. We went on a Tuesday night and there were plenty of open tables. I confirmed that they do take reservations and if you're looking to go Thursday through Sunday I would recommend making one. It's tiny and I imagine the wait could get long when they are busy. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they had no diet soda. The price point was fine in my opinion, but I'm sure others would say the portions are too small. I don't like to over eat so it was perfect."}
{"text":"There has been quite a bit of hype about this restaurant and I can see why! 

Quaint, open and friendly atmosphere. We didn't have a reservation, but we were able to enjoy an amazing dinner at their communal table on the patio. I was concerned we would be cold, but he heaters kept us nice and warm. The patio is decorated with vintage lights and ornaments, perfect for the holidays. 

Our server was such a delight, providing exceptional service and recommendations. The chefs were also fantastic and truly care about their customers. They even stopped cooking for a couple of minutes to help move a bench so our group could be closer.

We started with sourdough and potato and leek soup, perfect selection for this time of year. The potato and leek soup was silky and included a poached egg which added an even creamier and fuller flavor. We then moved to mid courses, trying the seared cauliflower, tortelli (my favorite) and pork belly. While all were fantastic, the tortelli and pork belly had so much flavor. The ingredients in both dishes had a warmth and seasonal flare. For main entrees, we enjoyed the beef cheeks and sea bass. Again, both were delightful but the sea bass was the winner. The sea bass was fresh and was accompanied by chorizo and clams all resting in a perfectly balanced sauce. It was my friend's birthday and the staff brought us a carrot cake on the house. We were so full, but couldn't resist. The carrot cake was not too sweet which was a perfect way to the end the meal. 

Ordering a craft cocktail is must here! They have a few selections on the menu or if you provide your drink profile, they serve you a delicious concoction! 

I'm looking forward to going back! They change their menu about every 4-6 weeks so I'm excited what will be on the menu next."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot!  Love the drinks and the bartender Mingy is amazing!! Definitely coming back for dinner!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this was a delicious treat meal. We decided to do a la carte instead of the chefs meal because we had very specific cravings. We really enjoyed this whole meal though the portions were large and we left stuffed!"}
{"text":"Great new spot. The carrot dish was amazing and one of my favorites. Octo is awesome, along with the chicken thigh and fish entree. Great space. Brunch on Sundays and late night till 2."}
{"text":"Great food, great people,  beautiful atmosphere, but a little expensive. They don't mind explaining everything and how the courses work. Glad we split the meals, pretty healthy foods and plentiful size of dishes for one person. Good experience."}
{"text":"What a lovely new addition to the Melrose neighborhood!  We made reservations with friends for Sunday brunch last month and had a great experience.  The restaurant is small (which means the kitchen is really small), but quaint, the service was good and the food was high quality and very tasty.  I enjoyed the eggs your way breakfast with over easy eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast with homemade jam.  My breakfast was quite simple, but they clearly use quality ingredients and it shines through in the taste.  We'll definitely be back for cocktails or dinner next time."}
{"text":"Over-hyped. Cocktails were okay. Basically, what you find everywhere else. Nothing progressive about it. It's basically the modern day Chili's. Feels like so many other places. This could easily be a Sam Fox concept, but at least the food at a SF restaurant would be executed the same way every time. The food is inconsistent here. Tasting menu is way overpriced for what you get. The dishes are not well executed. Some things needed salt. Some items were not cooked properly. Amateur hour in the kitchen.  Better spend a little bit more and go to Binkleys."}
{"text":"What an incredible meal! Ester and JP were the hosts and knew every note in every meal. They described every meal and pairing perfectly. 
Definitely a spot you want to have a date at. We had 5  meals each (total of 10. We were full after the first) and wine pairing for both of us each meal. The total was $260! We tipped for a total of $300 (FOR 5 MEALS!!) If you want a real date with amazing food, this is it!"}
{"text":"The single star is for the interior design. Ridiculously overpriced. Most of the dishes were over salted. Bathroom was located in the next building and didn't have an AC (it's summer.. in Phx,AZ..) Staff was nice and trying, until one of the chefs scolded the hostess/ waiter for messing up our reservation first time around. Kinda ruined my mood. Cocktails were nice. End up paying $560 for 6 people and not all of us got an entree since choices were all meat except one. Had to do the small dishes and was surprised to find a tiny cup of gazpacho was $11?! This is served for free in Spain by the way in most places.. it was overly blended too. My 31$ seafood entree had couple of bad clams that had the chlorine taste to them. In general, I won't be going back to what had the potential to be my neighborhood hidden gem, except for cocktails maybe, it's cozy. As it stands food wise, this place won't survive a month in Seattle, NY or SF. I hope they get their act together, I really do since I believe we should have way more of the local food art independent establishments around."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a date night and loved it! Fine dining has come to Melrose!! Much needed addition."}
{"text":"It's not a $$ place. If you're going to have five courses and a couple glasses of wine, expect to drop well over $200 for two people. We had three and it was over $160. That said, the staff was very accommodating to our dietary restrictions and the food was excellent. We had the trout and pork chop main course. Their use of spices helped make each dish just a little more enjoyable.

I'd give them five stars except for having set unrealistic price expectations in their listing. If price isn't a concern, Restaurant Progress is worth trying."}
{"text":"Perhaps the best dinner we've had in Phoenix.  It happened to be a special occasion for us, but with food, service, and setting this exquisite, every single day should be a special occasion.  

The menu appears to change weekly so, unless you have extreme food sensitivities or preferences, just go and trust you're going to have amazing food no matter what is fresh at that time.

We decided to go \"all in\" with the chef's 5-course dinner, with wine pairings, and weren't disappointed.  Each course was exactly the right size to allow you to really enjoy it, but still be able to move on to the courses to come.  Our waiter described each wine poured with great detail, including why it was being paired with each course.  Melrose's dining options just went interstellar with this gem.  You're 50 feet from 7th Ave and feel like you're sitting in Paris.  

Go.  Go now.  Go often."}
{"text":"This place is incredible and easily one of our favorites now.  They did a great job with everything; the decor, the intimate size, staff, music, menu, and most important, the food!  

We had almost everything on the menu.  The poached egg was simply amazing.  Never had one like that before and it pretty much ruined every poached egg I will have thereafter unless it is at this place.  The scallops were the best I have ever had - seriously!  Pork tenderloin was cooked perfectly and really good.  The crudo, pork belly & octopus were really good as well.  The only downside of the night was the NY strip.  It seemed a bit too seasoned and not as tender as I like.  It wasn't bad, just not great.  This was the last item to come out and our expectations at this time were probably too high based on how amazing everything was coming out.  

As someone else mentioned in their review - make sure to try the poached egg!"}
{"text":"One of the best dining experiences and cuisine I've had in a LONG time. Everyone from the host to the kitchen staff put in so much care and attention to detail into our dining experience. The rotating menu keeps things new and exciting to keep coming back and try more. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful and feels clean and fresh. Had a wonderful time at Restaurant Progress and will be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"Don't sleep on this hidden gem! Everything about Restaurant Progress is carefully thought out and executed, without seeming like they're trying too hard. From the atmosphere, to service, to food - it's a delight. These guys go above and beyond what I expect from typical PHX restaurants. Seriously - this could easily pass for a Brooklyn or West Hollywood spot (& I mean that in the best way possible.)

Cocktails were fun but dinner was one of the best in recent memory. We had the tasting menu, which was filled with generous portions. Highlights included the beef carpaccio, sea bass and carrot cake. 

 Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"So much potential!  Most everything we ordered was tasty. The tortelli was way too salty. The scallops were delicious!!! The raspberry desert was so pretty, but lacked a little in sophistication and complexity. Yes, I ate it!  I will come back. I want to see how this place grows and develops in the coming years. Looking forward to the new patio and new bathroom. The temporary bathroom is a little creepy."}
{"text":"Yes. You just visit this place. I haven't been to 7th Ave in a while and hearing about this place we had to check it out. I've not been a handful of times and every time the cocktails and food options are so delicious. Somehow the hostess even remembers me! It also reminds me of a quaint restaurant in NYC or something. Watch out though, it's surround by some fun establishments!"}
{"text":"I don't like to give less than fabulous reviews, but we were really disappointed in this restaurant and will not be coming back. The food was horribly over salted; when we brought that to our server's attention, he didn't have the dish removed from our bill or offer any other solution. On a positive note, the decor is cute and the menu is interesting. If the kitchen can improve their execution, I think it has potential. :)"}
{"text":"I realized that I don't normally rate a place on my first visit, let alone on any ONE visit. I usually have developed some kind of comfort, or rapport with a place, before I put in my two-cents. Really, that probably remains the best approach, particularly in trying to review it for someone who's never been. One can vouch for consistency, for example, and not be swayed by highs nor lows on any one particular visit. Obviously then, you can gather my first impression with Progress was a damn good one, right?

Well then, here I am back, a week later to the day. Same time frame, even. There's a bit more business tonight, a higher vibe, and two more staffers on-deck...a good sign, all-around. I put in my order, and go sit at the head of the bar, farthest from the kitchen. The four-top to my right has obviously been enjoying themselves, and were piecing through the pork loin rather slowly. I complimented their discipline in not stabbing each other over who gets what. I was informed that this about their tenth plate, so they were winding down, LOL. They even got a long bench along ONE side of the giant patio table. Nice!

The Bluefin crudot had sold out for the evening, and I was surprise with what the chef brought me as a replacement...the beet salad. I've never been a fan, and would have NEVER ordered this of my own volition. BUT, he had the confidence, and he proceeded to explain this artful array of fruits, cheese, and wild honey on my plate. Suffice to say, it works....and works beautifully. I'd gladly have eaten a 2nd portion back-to-back, and will not hesitate to put it into my rotation. More on that later. 

Now then, the steak. I'm not a food writer, and I have little eye for the \"arts\". However, I know that plating is an art, and what was brought out to me could surely hang on a wall. 'Nuff said for that aspect. Again, it's the taste that counts...right? Some feel a steak is a steak is a steak, and it should stand on its own...alone. Obviously, that's certainly one way. However, I do enjoy accompaniments like good horseradish with prime rib,  or pickled ginger on my sushi, and yes...sometimes sauce on Carolina BBQ. Well, I seem to recall some special baby roasted onions, and a whip of celery root on there as it was described to me. In truth, I barely had enough time to ask too many questions about the presentation before it was all down-the-hatch.  Everything came together to compliment the meat, not overshadow it, nor diminish it. Surely the best steak outside of a steakhouse, that I've ever had.

Now, a bit more on the beets. I didn't mean to ignore its beauty on the plate, for it certainly had that. In hindsight though, this 'salad' would be what I'd recommend to you as a dessert item, on a menu that currently has no dessert items. With the fruits, cream and honey, it would really be a nice finish to whatever else you had explored there. So, just a suggestion for you before you try it out. 

Once, again...I left with even more respect for Progress and anticipation of what I will try next, and some of the chef's ideas-to-come. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Restaurant Progress based on a recommendation from a liquor distribution rep.  Read all the reviews, of which the vast majority were positive and so we entrusted this place with our 35th anniversary dinner.  We are glad we did.  Thoroughly enjoyed the rustic ambience and relatively small size.  We were serviced by Esther Noh, who also happens to be the general manager.  She was right on point with every aspect of our evening, from drink recommendations, to course pacing, to descriptions of the chef and bartender's offerings for our Chef's Choice dinner and wine pairing.  To be sure, it was a little pricey but the food offerings were very different and excellent.  We really appreciated that although we both ordered the Chef's Choice, each of us received a different offering than the other for each course.  So we were really able to experience 10 different courses over the evening.  The same was done with our wine pairings, each of us received a wine that was paired with our particular plate, so we were able to try 8 different wines and two digestifs.  What a smart thing to do.  We salute the chef, the bartender and Esther.  We enjoyed so many different tastes, each one better than the last.  Although, the evening was fairly expensive, it was worth it.  We will be back with friends in tow.  We may not do the Chef's Choice every time but we can still enjoy many of their other offerings and the great cocktails as well (we had a cocktail prior to our dinner experience), I had an ultimo palabra and my wife had the cachaca-chaca.  I will be ordering these drinks again next time we visit."}
{"text":"Amazing dishes. Lots of love and creativity goes into making the food. It's a small restaurant as others have said. Everything was top notch. From the drinks, to the food, to the service.
The beef carpaccio was the best I've ever had. The chicken dumpling gnocchi was incredible. The staff works hard, and you can tell from the experience you have in the restaurant. It was also nice because you could actually have a conversation with the people you're eating with. We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"In town for work and went to Yelp to find something different. Wasn't in the mood for Mexican or Asian fusion on this trip. You can find those on every corner in Phoenix. No offense.

Was blown away by this place.  Reading the Yelp reviews, I get it, wasn't going to be my standard $20 applebees dinner.  That being said, we got what we paid for then some. 

We did the Chefs tasting and it was unbelievable. The bartender and host were super attentive and courteous. We had the chefs in plain sight since it's a smaller space and they were engaging and having a good time. Always good when you can tell they're enjoying their craft. 

On the plate, from start to finish, we tried practically everything on the menu. Dinner for two with each of us doing a chefs tasting, they made it so they brought out two different courses each time. I will warn you, it's a lot of food. Not sure what people are complaining about regarding portions. If you want that kind of meal, go to Cheesecake Factory.  I love to eat and it was more than plenty of food for us both. 

My favs: carpaccio, the duck, and the raspberry desert. If you're going to order one thing, order the carpaccio. You'll see them and hear them pounding it out before they bring it to your table.  

Amazing dinner experience. Not your everyday dinner spot but very glad I found this gem and hope to come back on my next trip out."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing we had the vegetable salad and the pork tenderloin. The presentation was beautiful but the flavors were delicious and flavorful just a gorgeous meal.  Like we were eating a work of art and we were!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere. Great cocktails too! It's a small place so I recommend reservations. We also have always missed the bread as it sells out early each night."}
{"text":"A menu out of this world. Like nothing else. 
I found it hard to find as there is no a sign sticking out and it's very small. 
The food is crazy good, and they explain everything in it when they bring your meal. 
Wines and drinks are fantastic. I watched the bartender make new fashions (yes, a twist on the old fashions) with so much attention to detail. 
The bathroom could be scary for a woman. You have to go outside to a little studio looking place that is more like an empty location. Huge door and huge bathroom for some reason doesn't feel safe, but I guess it is."}
{"text":"The team behind Progress is built on grit. They are passionate about the work they do and put blood, sweat, and tears behind every dish they make. TJ and the rest of the crew love what they do and it shows. From the unique cocktails to the late night dinner menu, you can feel the appreciation this team has for their craft. You will be hard pressed to find a team as scrappy as the one at Progress who can create an experience this mind-blowing.

During my visit, we ate the yellowtail crudo, something with octopus, and a cannellini bean dish that made me question why I hadn't eaten something like it before. All of that was paired with cocktails that were on par with most places in the Valley and complemented by the inviting atmosphere of Progress. When you eat there, it feels like you accidentally stumbled into a chef's private demo kitchen. I would recommend Progress to anyone with an appetite for something new.

Full disclosure: I'm friends with some people at Progress. Take that as you please, just know that Progress will have you wanting to come back starting the minute you leave."}
{"text":"Fab new edition to the Central Phx food scene! I'd been waiting for this place to open since AZ Foodie hosted the chef at a pop-up dinner last year. Finally!! This place is off an running after only being open about a month. Dinner with another couple that likes to share was a perfect way to taste almost everything on the menu.

We started off with cocktails. I loved the nu-fashioned. The description made me think of a manhattan/sazarac twist, but I didn't notice the absinthe if it was there. I wasn't a fan of the root-beer style negroni. In all fairness- it was just as the waitress described- a negroni with root beer spices. Just not my style.

I didn't take a pic of the menu so I'm sure I'm forgetting some of the ingredients in all of the descriptions below, but each was presented as a gorgeous balance of textures and flavors. It would be impossible to pick a fave of the three starters. The crudo came with small cubes of fish, crispy nori, and a light creamy dollop of avocado cream. The kale salad was perfect- shredded and cubes of cheese, just the right amount of dressing, sweet and crunchy deliciousness. The roasted red and gold beets came with strawberries that were way sweeter than any I've found in a grocery store and was served over a sauce that held it all together from plate to mouth. For my money, this was the best section of the menu. I could've ordered two of each of these, but was glad I didn't since there was more goodness to come.

Second course. The carrots came roasted, shredded, pureed- light and flavorful. The sous vide egg with mushrooms was also good, esp the macadamia nut cream that it came with, but a little hard to eat. The egg was nice and runny and the sauce at the bottom of the dish tasty, but it needed some good bread to soak it all up. 

Main courses are small but pack a lot of flavor. My fave was the scallops- 4 of them with small pieces of candied bacon/cranberry. Wow! The steak was also good- with a horseradish powder dusted over the top. Our only complaint was that it came with 3 small bites not ideal for a party of 4. And for $30 it would have been nice of them to add one more piece- or at least offer it to us for an up-charge. That said, the half of a bite that I was able to try was cooked perfectly and full of flavor.

Only one desert option which didn't appeal to me. That said- there is a gorgeous shelf full of amaros behind the bar, so next time I'll end dinner with one of those. The waitress said the menu will be changing next month. Sad to see these winning dishes go away, but can't wait to see what comes next. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Every dish is unique - succulent with every bite. The cocktails are strong and absolutely tasteful! By far the best new restaurant in town."}
{"text":"This was our first time to try this hidden neighborhood gem. We are so very happy we did! We sat at the bar and had amazing service. We shared the farro salad, the tortellini and the duck. Everything was absolutely perfect. We will be back often and will recommend this place to our friends."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant, staff and menu. The food was off the charts and the drinks amazing! Perfect for a special date night or evening out with friends."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant back in March for friend's birthday dinner. We were a group of 12 and the restaurant was very accommodating. We had a huge table in the whimsical back patio. The only way to describe the patio is that it was darling, the lights and decor were the perfect touch. I think we tried about 75 percent of the menu that night, being such a big group we ordered everything and shared. We found it interesting that we really enjoyed most of the dishes but a few of them were way too salty. The things that really stood out that night were the beets, gnocchi and the duck were all fabulous. This restaurant has a rotating seasonal menu which is great because everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this spot near our hood for a while now. Love the melrose district location. Quaint and intimate setting. Reminds me of some cool spots we frequented in denver. Good service and awesome
Food. Sunday brunch may just become one of my regular spots. A bit pricy but all our dishes were tasty.  Still need to try the dinner and cocktail menu but until then they get five stars."}
{"text":"Treated like royalty, this crew really knows how to treat a girl! Great food, great drinks!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little gem with innovative and delicious food! The portions of the first two courses were large and could easily be shared. Esther was a delight offering suggestions and impeccable service. Lovely space and atmosphere! Look forward to many return visits!  The beef bourguignon was amazing, as was the carpaccio!"}
{"text":"This is a cool restaurant with really nice people but the food is just okay. We tried a number of dishes and the gnoccetti was the best but the sea bass over cooked with way too much going on taste wise. Also all the food could benefit from seasoning, e.g. Salt. It looks like from past reviews a number of people mentioned too much salt in the food, so looks like the restaurant trying to accommodate all but not tasting food before it goes out. I would probably try again cause the atmosphere is cool but stick to land items and be careful what I ordered."}
{"text":"We are from So Cal, we consider our selves foodies. We have traveled all over the world and have experienced the local cuisine in various countries. It was an extreme surprise/pleasure when visiting Phoenix's Restaurant Progress, the food, drinks and service was equal to any of our previous dining experiences. We strongly recommend a visit !!! 

Carlos & Adrian"}
{"text":"An absolute treat. If you are a foodie, you will enjoy every single bite from every dish at your table."}
{"text":"Restaurant progress is a welcome addition to the Phoenix culinary scene, the decor is very cool and the service is amazing, the menu has something for everyone. It will change monthly so I am sure to visit often to see what the chefs create each month. The steak I had rivals any I've ever tasted! And don't miss the cocktails that the bar has. I will definitely be back. Thank you for the  best restaurant experience I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night on a friends recommendation.what a welcome surprise. Made us feel we were in one of San Francisco's charming chef owned spots, only were were right in the middle if the melrose district. The ambience was charming and the candle lights added to the feeling we were in for something special . We had two appetizers and shared the pork tenderloin .Every bite was perfectly seasoned and the right kind of spicy. The wine list is well thought out and there is a full bar as well. They're working on their small outdoor patio and we re planning to get back there while the weather still permits alfresco dining. Truly a small gem in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I live in the North Valley and made the trek to Central Phoenix to give Restaurant Progress a try. To say the least, I was not disappointed! Finally a spot that doesn't have a massive menu filled with the same ole, same ole. The spot is cozy with warm, fresh decor that makes you feel warm and inviting with great music playing in the background that was not too loud that set the tone for a great meal. I highly recommend starting with a mixed drink professionally mixed by a skilled mixologist. Every dish I had was very fresh and prepared with care with spot on presentation and delicious. I would recommend anyone to venture out of your comfort zone and try some of the foods that you wouldn't ordinarily try as this is not your ordinary fare. Great spot to bring your special someone!"}
{"text":"Brilliant. If I could give 6 stars I would.. The ingredients are fresh and high quality. The menu selections are off beat and forces you out of your culinary comfort zone. In a quaint ambience and a price that is reachable for Arizonans, especially for this caliber of a meal."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is delicious: this last time I ordered the pork belly and I could not have been happier, it had a very interesting combination of flavors and textures. Definitely the quality and flavor of the dishes make up for the size of their portions. I have been here for weekend brunch as well and I have not been disappointed. What I love the most about this place is the fact they close late, we need more places in central Phoenix open late."}
{"text":"Went here for our anniversary. Food was incredible. Environment was quaint and very unique. We both ordered chef's choice along with the wine pairings. So much food and great value for the price! We loved every single dish. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Nailed it!  Atmosphere perfect, staff perfect, music perfect. And above all the food was perfect.  Fine dining experience- Small menu, which I think is smart, and every single thing was quality. I live in the Melrose district and can Walk here, and we are so thrilled to have such a great restaurant/bar in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"While the menu is small, it's not a problem because every dish my girlfriend and I had during the chef's choice five course meal was top notch. Seriously, their steak might be the best one I've ever had. The cocktails are unique, and great too. I'll be back very soon to see what new dishes are on the menu next month!

Pro tip: The decor is awesome, but the place is small so you may want to call ahead once this place gets busy!"}
{"text":"Came here for an evening out and was not disappointed.  The server/bartender did an amazing job of describing the menu along with tending to our needs and questions.  The team service that was present here kept our waters full and the ninjaesque which I always appreciate.  We started off with the beet Escarole which was delish.  My lady and I appreciate beets done to perfection and the dish did not disappoint.  We then did the entrees which were all good portions size and something that I love is that the menu is always rotating.

Overall I love the ambiance of the restaurant, the service and the unpredictable menu.  If I'm going to walk into a restaurant and have expectations squished for the good this is the place to go.  Always exciting and always a beautiful outcome!!! I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Bit skeptical at first but once we were inside it was an amazing experience. We decided to sit at the bar for the view of the kitchen. We had three people so we shared two appetizers ( melt in your mouth scallops, the ahi), two light dishes (gnocchi, the squash linguini) and one entree (duck and omg the carrot purée) and everything was incredible and I can't pick a favorite. We were full before we started desserts but we got one each of the desserts anyway and they were all amazing, perfect consistency like your grandmothers baking with the exception of the lemon semifreddo which was nothing like anything I've had before. Everything we had was full of flavor and you could taste every ingredient he used. 
In addition to the food the team atmosphere there was what really made the experience over the top. Peaceful and comforting and exotic all at the same time."}
{"text":"I stumbled into Restaurant Progress a couple of months ago on a first date. It has now become my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix. The chef is incredible, making the food beautiful and delicious. The cocktails are amazing and unique. And then there is the staff. UGH! These people are just so damn sweet and nice is its unbelievable. Definitely recommend for your next date night!"}
{"text":"Went for the Chef's tasting menu. Between four of us we were able to try practically all of TJ's culinary delights. The Carpaccio (prominently displayed in photos) was f-ing fantastic. Not a scrap was left. The Beef Cheeks were phenomenal. Everyone there was as fantastic as the food. Mingy served up some delicious cocktails while we waited for our table. We ordered off the drink menu which was diverse but not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Restaurant Progress is a restaurant in Phoenix, which combines elegance with rustic and vintage design, while offering savory and original New American food. If you have a visit to Phoenix with only a few meals to try local fare or are looking for a nice date out, Restaurant Progress is a solid choice for your dinner.

I was visiting for a work trip and ate dinner at Restaurant Progress. I was seated without a wait at table near the bar. As I entered, I noted the vintage Renault sedan in patina paint parked in front. The atmosphere was delightful from the lighting to the wood used for the walls and floors. 

I ordered the blue fin tuna carpaccio as an appetizer, which was thin tuna coated in panko and foe gras. For an entrée, I had the chicken fried trout. The name is deceiving; as there is no chicken. Instead, you get trout coated with southern breading and fried. It was really wonderful. I had a few local craft beers with my meal and was very satisfied. You can order a la carte or choose from a price fix menu.

Restaurant Progress is very much worth visiting. The decor is stunning, relaxing, non-pretensious, and the food is delightful. If I am in Phoenix, I will return."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, and love the atmosphere in the evening. The service is also excellent. Our server was so warm and friendly. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I love food, so when I stopped here on a day off and read some of the other reviews that were highly complimentary of this restaurant, I had to give it a try.

First off, it's small but beautiful, I was seated on the patio on a beautiful night and the ambiance was truly delightful. The wait staff were very gracious and accommodating, and I have nothing but nice things to say about them. I decided to get a Sazerac to drink (which was delicious) and try the chef's tasting menu.

First course: scallop crudo, almost like a ceviche. Anaheim (Or Fresno? Can't remember) peppers gave a really nice but not overbearing heat with a wonderful flavor, while some fresh mint leaves helped cool things a bit. A playful dusting of - I believe - chopped pistachio helped give a nice crunch element to the dish. A really nice way to start the meal.

Second course: raw heirloom tomatoes with blue cheese crumbled on top, and some olive oil and a fried green tomato on the bottom. Some of the best tomatoes I've ever tasted, and the salty tang of the blue cheese paired exquisitely with the warm, summer-infused, savory flavors of the tomatoes. The fried green tomato added a welcome texture component to the dish, and the breading was perfectly crunchy; not the *slightest* bit soggy.

Third course: These were mini-gnocchi in - I believe - tomato and cream or milk-based sauce. The flavors were good, but the entire dish suffered from being slightly overseasoned. Further, the gnocchi were perhaps half a minute under being perfectly al dente, and were the tiniest bit rubbery. The Kalamata olives in this dish were spectacular, adding just the perfect brine-y pop. Size-size, things started to get a little big here - the portion size could have been about half for this plate and the one that followed.

Fourth course: Quail with a tapenade, cannellini beans, and grilled onions. The least successful course, in my opinion. Like the last, this dish suffered from being overseasoned. Quail can be difficult to eat at the best of times because it's such a small bird, and in this case it was quite hidden under a thick layer of tapenade and other toppings that made it difficult to see to cut. The onions were a little stringy and difficult to eat, and there was a strong...smokey? flavor that I found...unbalanced. As with the gnocchi, less would have been more with portion sizes.

Fifth course: Dessert, and a return to deliciousness. A milk chocolate mousse crusted with cocoa nibs, and a mint-infused fresh whipped cream with a dulce de leche sauce and sliced blackberries with mint leaves. Not too sweet, but still read as a dessert. The milk chocolate had a fresh milk taste and the cocoa nibs were perfectly crunchy, and the highlight of this dish. The mint whipped cream fused perfectly with the chocolate and overall, this entire dish sang. My only - very minor - critique here was the stems of the mint leaves were a little tough and difficult to chew, but this is again very minor.

Overall, a delightful place to have dinner and a drink. I'd definitely come back. My only complaint about the restaurant itself was the kitchen staff *loudly* arguing and swearing at each other. Totally unprofessional. I get it, kitchens can be rough-and-tumble, but if you're going to have an open kitchen, do not bitch at each other in front of the guests. It's very poor form.

7/10."}
{"text":"Incredible environment with exquisite tastes in every course. Be prepared for emptying your wallet for a full course, but you will have no regret. Limited selection allows for focused menu that meets everyone somewhere, from steak to fish and cocktails to beer."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time the menu has been different.  Incredibly fresh and creative.  The place is small and quaint, the vibe is a mix of upscale and urban fusion.  Not a place for a quick eat and go.  Come here for a great experience, stay a while and take it all in."}
{"text":"You know, I'll keep this short. This was simply the best food experience my wife and I have ever had. Go."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. The service was personable and yet not intrusive.  The atmosphere is rather quiet but not boring at all. The decor is perfect. The food is truly inspired. The flavors complemented each other perfectly. I have rarely had a meal this amazing. It is a higher end restaurant, so plan on staying a bit and paying for what you get. I can't recommend this restaurant enough."}
{"text":"Are at Restaurant Progress last night and I can't say enough how impressed I was. Th service was impeccable but unpretentious, the food on point and the ambiance was totally surprising for Phoenix. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Restaurant Progress embodies everything you expect in a fine dining experience, with the intimacy of being in your mother's kitchen. The chefs and staff deliver a truly unforgettable experience. The rotating menu features seasonal ingredients, and when you taste the dishes, you can tell everything is fresh and in season. The cocktail list features some awesome drinks, including one with barrel aged Gin! I highly recommend coming to restaurant Progress, order the tasting menu to make sure you get the best they have to offer on the menu before it's gone!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience!  Did the tasting menu of 5 courses, loved every one of the dishes that was sent to the table. Everything is really approachable here, all their bottles of wine are $36, great cocktails, too. I will definitely be back and will encourage those who have not been here to come check it out!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Phoenix!! I've lived in the valley my entire life, and I can honestly say I've  never been to the Melrose district, but I fell in love with the area. This place could not be a better fit, and will be a great addition to the Phoenix suburb. I absolutely love this place, whether it be the amazing service, decor, lighting, cocktail list, food or even the gorgeous back patio (which is still in the works) these guys hit out of the park. This quaint little restaurant will be a name stay in Phoenix for a long time."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I am comparing it to other high-end restaurants in the same realm, not all restaurants. While my dinner here was quite good by most standards, I left feeling a bit disappointed.

Since Restaurant Progress came highly recommended, I decided to go all out with the 5 course Chef's Choice tasting menu and the accompanying wine pairing. The first course of the Tartare Toast and Brut Rose was fantastic, but the quality of each subsequent course deteriorated. The midcourse pairing of Roasted Carrot and rosé of Pinot noir was far enough off the mark that it felt like the team was starting to get lazy. I had really hoped for main course redemption, but despite an appealing Thai curry flavor concept, the Striped Bass fell a bit short and a particularly poor pairing with a Nero d'Avola didn't help. The zucchini cake dessert was wonderful, but was too little too late. 

I will note that my date ordered a few a la carte items including the Gnocchetti, which was top notch. Until the chef and sommelier craft the tasting menu and pairing more thoughtfully, I'd suggest ordering to your own tastes from the menu."}
{"text":"Waaaaaay too salty. People say I use too much salt, and I can barely eat some of the food here. The first time I went, I thought it was just a one time mistake. The second time, same thing. Really sad because the food is incredible! And the service is even more outstanding!! Please, go easy on the salt. I'm not the only one that thinks this, I just read a few reviews that says the food is too salty. Bummed. Please take this to heart."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited the restaurant on a Tuesday night and had a wonderful experience.  We had a reservation and contacted the restaurant a couple times to adjust since we were running late and the hostess took great care of us.  Fortunately it wasn't terribly busy but based off other reviews and speaking with the staff I would DEFINITELY make a reservation, especially Thursday through Sunday.  The food was everything we expected and MORE.  We were in a bit of a rush so we ordered 4 different items between us and shared them and it worked out great.  We had the bluefin crudo, cauliflower steak, tortelli and duck.  All were fabulous and our only regret is that we didn't have time to try more plates!  The decor is unique and cozy and the service staff was wonderful as well. Go and enjoy yourselves!"}
{"text":"I was in town for business and wanted something locally owned and unique.  This didn't disappoint!!  My dinner was \"lick your plate\" good. Esther, the general manager, served my food and drinks at the bar. She had fantastic drink suggestions and do knowledgeable about the food. Next time I am in central Phoenix I will come here for the full tasting menu!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight and the food was all very good.
Here's why I'm giving it a 3 stars:

Food: 4.5 stars
Price point: 3 stars (on the pricy side for small portion food)
Server: 4 stars
Hostess: 1 star (she was weird and had NO people skills)."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic -- from the beginning till the end. Started with the tartare and scallops -- then Orecchiette -- then duck l'orange. All phenomenal. Finished with the lemon / almond dessert. The atmosphere was very quaint -- you can watch the chefs do their magic. Cocktails looked great -- but we did a bottle of wine. Definitely a great date night place."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place five stars because the food truly commands five stars but there was a really big issue for me that took away not just from the food but the overall atmosphere and therefore enjoyment of the experience. That issue was the stifling heat. We were seating by the front window at a two top table and the heat and lack of airflow was so bad that I was drenched in sweat by the end of the meal. In addition, despite downing large amounts of water, I became so swollen I couldn't even remove my wedding ring from my finger. The whole restaurant was HOT and even our waiter was glistening with sweat. I found that I ate my food as fast as I could so I could keep things moving as I was just so uncomfortable and miserable. It really took away from the experience and I won't be back any time in the summer months unless they get the air conditioning problem fixed otherwise I'll just wait until winter. I wish I would've cancelled the rest of our food when it got so uncomfortably hot and just left because it was awful and made me feel sick. 

The issue with the air conditioner is really a shame because the food is simply amazing. My only issue when it comes to the food is the so called tasting menu. It's not really a tasting menu in my opinion since it's just the chef selecting one of each course to serve you. What you are getting is a discounted price which is great but understand if you order this tasting menu alone, you're only getting one of each selection and you don't get to choose and secondly if you do it with another person or several you will get so much food you will leave very full. Personally for me, I would've rather picked what we wanted to eat and done things family style rather then had two of every option because we left over full and didn't really enjoy the last few dishes we had because we were over full already as well as uncomfortably hot. I also must note that I think it's ridiculous that you have to pay for bread. At the very least you should get the first basket for free, especially when you are having a salad and pasta course. At the prices one is paying to eat here, this comes across as cheap and tacky. 

Again food is fabulous but the temperature in the restaurant makes the overall dining experience miserable. I recommend waiting to eat here until the winter months. Hopefully management will get the air conditioning problem fixed soon."}
{"text":"Great spot.  Just the right amount of options on the menu for this crew to make everything exceptional!  Cocktail program is a nice touch and the WINE list has developed into a great complement to the food.

This restaurant will quickly become one of the top dinning destinations in AZ!"}
{"text":"Really cool new place. Love the open kitchen. Bartenders were friendly and efficient. The yellowtail appetizer was fantastic. My complaint was that for the type of place (small, loud, casual) I felt the prices were high. I did not want to spend $30 on an entree. So, I limited myself to the appetizer. Good luck to the owners. I enjoyed my visit."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant on yelp and decided this place would be great for my boyfriends birthday dinner. It did not disappoint! I'm a big believer that if money isn't an issue, you should order from the left side of the menu (not paying attention to price on the right typically). Since this was a special dinner, we ordered what sounded good, not what was cheap. We both got entrees and a cocktail. They were spectacular! I got the scallops and he the steak. The combination of flavor was very diverse and the atmosphere was relaxed, but still formal. We also decided to get dessert and end the night with another round of drinks. I spent roughly $100 + $25 tip for the night and it was well worth it! Will be back for my birthday soon!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time last night, had no idea what type of a restaurant it was, read tons of great reviews on here so I decided to give it a shot. This place is the future of restaurant in phoenix, for a second there I thought I was in a restaurant in Greenwich village in NYC. The manager asked if I had any food limitations or restrictions so I told her yes so she made sure my food was prepared correctly. The food is excellent and the service is excellent here.  I loved my experience and I will return soon with more friends to experience this place."}
{"text":"Restaurant Progress is an awesome, diamond in the rough establishment.  Very open and extremely friendly atmosphere where you can see the cooks preparing your meal in a highly systematic fashion and smiles on all of the staffs faces! 

Initially we had came without booking a reservation (which I know better next time) the restaurant seemed a lot bigger on Yelp than it actually is in person.  Which is actually really cool to me.  You definitely get the intimate vibe and feel like the staff knows you and your life.  I was too busy being interested in the drink I was sipping on and forgot the waiter's name.  He was awesome needless to say and he was very knowledgeable about the food, as he explained everything effortlessly.  

After dinner we had moved to the bar, and ordered their carrot cake and coffee.  The carrot cake was insanely delicious, super airy and flavorful.  The buttercream they used was out of this world and the coffee was so good that when we left we were full and alert - haha! I would definitely recommend coming here, bring a date or the love of your life.  Just make sure to book a reservation as this place is up to that standard.

Keep up the amazing work team!"}
{"text":"We tried restaurant progress for the first time last night loved everything about the meal, service, and cozy atmosphere! Everything on the menu was fresh, prepared in the open kitchen, and perfectly created by the friendly chiefs that own the restaurant. I loved that you could try multiple different tastes with their small, mid size and entree plates. The bread with the chive butter was amazing! We ordered the beets with berries first and they were put on top of the creamiest best tasing goat cheese we have ever had. We then had the red lettuce salad which was like no other salad we have ever had! Every bite was exceptional and we especially loved the homemade green goddess dressing.  The orecchiette was perfection, made on demand in the kitchen, and the sauce was creamy but not too rich. The pork belly medium plate was perfectly cooked and we were a little full by the time we got to the main dishes. The two main dishes were full of flavor and we enjoyed every bite of the sea bass and steak. The chocolate mousse was the perfect blend of bitter and sweet. We will definitely bring our family and friends back soon!! Make sure to get reservations if you want to go too!"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with my family for brunch. Everything was delicious! We had the French Toast with those delicious caramelized bananas, the French Breakfast, the Lox Sammy and the Croque Madam. The Bloody Mary's were also fabulous. I'm very excited to come back for dinner. I have only heard the best buzz about it! Thanks for a great time."}
{"text":"Tried this place based on the great yelp reviews, but was really disappointed by the quality of the food. Had a pasta dish that tasted like an entire jar of olives was added to it. The service was okay and the decor was nice, so I'll give it 2 stars, but the relatively high prices and the terrible food will definitely keep me from going back. Also, the server should have asked what was wrong with the pasta dish that we didn't touch. Instead he just asked if we wanted a box to go, which we certainly did not. The chef may want to look at the full plates coming back and ask what can be done to improve. Don't waste your time with this place."}
{"text":"What a sweet surprise on my way to get cough medicine! Tucked in right next to Melrose Pharmacy, Restaurant Progress is a new restaurant here in the Melrose District.
The ambience is cozy and romantic, with a rustic but sleek aesthetic that is inviting for couples and groups alike. Though the space is small, I didn't mind it, as the location is the perfect place for locals to just wander in serendipitously, and that's exactly what the owner wants. We sat at the bar and chatted with the hostess, chef and bartender.
They were so excited to open, they just went for it, even if a few things were still in the works, like final business cards and their website (they're active on Instagram though). They had their first service last Friday, and just were happy to be a part of the neighborhood.
The menu has interesting flavors, including cocktails like Templeton Rye \"Banana Pancakes\" and dishes like the Octo and Pork Belly. Both tasted good, but were a little more on the higher price end for Melrose.
Either way, I welcome Restaurant Progress with open arms, we need more tasty restaurants around here, and this seems like a great addition."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an exquisite birthday dinner here. Scallops, carpaccio, quail, beef bourguignon, vanilla pudding, and red wine. Every dish was plated beautifully and every component seemed to meet its highest potential of flavor. The staff was knowledgeable and warm. It was a truly wonderful dining experience. Probably the best I've yet to have in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Just as expected! I had been dyeing to go here for dinner for awhile, my husband took me out for a date night and surprised me by taking me to Restaurant Progress! The ambiance is SO romantic, especially the back patio with the flowers and lights. Make reservations because it is small. I really enjoyed that the kitchen is literally right there in the restaurant, you can watch the entire process of your food being made. Service was beyond top notch, our waitress was so well versed on every menu item and was more than happy to share with us every detail. The menu changes daily with whatever is fresh, I can't wait to go back for another taste! Our dinner was excellent!"}
{"text":"We had a very good dinner there!  Everyone was very nice. The tar tar was salty but good. The scallops were really good. Light and fresh!  The pasta dish was great!  And the beef cheek was top notch!  Will go back soon!"}
{"text":"This place is a hard find; but a good thing because too much traffic will impose time limitations on great cooking... We felt like the cook and staff were solely attending to our palates ... It was Devine!!!  Great tasting menu; the menu choices are unique and small, but each plate has a narrative.. The fresh, crunchy toasted Brussels sprouts was so easy to do, but nonetheless sophisticated.   We loved the salad dish , it was a great addition to the meat and fish plates... The lemon dessert was a cold, spirited end to a slow pace and comfortable meal.  Alcohol was pricey , but it pays for the lights and aesthetic ambiance ...wine choices will satisfy even the woody palate .... A must for those who want to live good ....even for a day!!!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my husband's birthday here last night and each of us ordered the tasting menu. It was perfect because we were each given different items and got to experience most of the restaurant's selections. Each course was beautifully presented, delicious and not like anything I'd had at other restaurants. We started with the steak tartar and marinated watermelon salad before moving onto a fried green tomato salad with yummy bleu cheese and a beet salad. The avocado with crab along with the pork belly over white beans were to die for. The entrees were sea bass (cooked to perfection with crispy skin) and duck over pureed sweet potato. The meal ended with chocolate peanut butter mousse for me and a raspberry napoleon for my husband - simply outstanding. 
It's a very small space, so make a reservation."}
{"text":"This is small,  new restaurant that offers possibly the tastiest food in Phoenix! Save your money to eat out for a social occasion and then go here! I highly recommend the chef's 5-course tasting menu, so you don't even need to deal with making decisions. I guarantee each dish will be delicious. The menu changes every several weeks. Not only is the food just the tastiest, but both the GM, who has been our primary server, and the bartender and so friendly and wonderful to interact with.  Get yourself to Restaurant Progress!"}
{"text":"I heard about Restaurant Progress from my cousin who is friends with the chef/owner. I went to their brunch with a friend shortly after they opened. The restaurant itself is very modern and has a great atmosphere. The brunch menu is nice, if a little on the simple side. The dishes were a little more expensive than other brunch places, but not significantly. I ordered their egg breakfast (eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast for 11$) and added a side of gravy. This, my friends, is gold. The gravy is insanity. The potatoes were delish. I ate everything on my plate. My friend ordered their French scrambled eggs..... I usually hate scrambled eggs, but these were on point. So soft, light, and fluffy. They came with roasted tomatoes (which I love). I would probably get these the next time I go. We also tried a couple cocktails, which were tasty and priced at about average as compared to other craft cocktail bars (11$ ish). I'd love to come try dinner (it definitely is pricier) and I would definitely come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"That was one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while. Chef Frankie Romo outdid himself. Every dish was delicious and the presentation was like pieces of art. The ambiance was cozy, trendy, just a great vibe!  Aaaand the cocktails, unique and amazing!  Our time there was truly special!!
Will definitely make the trip to come back.... from San Diego!"}
{"text":"The night my fiance and I got engaged we dined at Restaurant Progress. I am SO glad we chose this restaurant to wrap up the perfect day. We selected the 5 course tasting menu and it was the best meal I've ever had (I have experience waitressing in the fine-dining industry and have had my share of masterpiece dishes). It was such a sweet experience to have the restaurant owner be our server! She was professional, friendly, and timely. Each dish was detailed to us as it was delivered. We had already ordered delicious cocktails (perfect pours might I add), yet the owner treated us with complimentary prosecco with dessert as a congratulations! I greatly look forward to returning! Thank you thank you thank you!"}
{"text":"Rarely am I blown away by a restaurant.. it would be an understatement just to state that \"this place left me satisfied and pleasantly surprised \". 
My wife and I happened to see a yelp advertisement for this restaurant and thought it looked cool and inviting, we made a reservation for the outdoor seating at 8:30 on a Friday night. From the moment we walked through the front door of this quaint, hidden gem, we were warmly greeted and immediately seated at our table on the outdoor patio. I was immediately drawn to the open atmosphere and \"out in the open \" kitchen area. They don't hide anything, the food is being prepared for everyone to see. Our server, Harrison, was exceptional. Just the right amount of friendliness, without being overbearing or annoying. He immediately took our dirty plates after the kale salad was devoured, and brought us new silverware when our entrees arrived. The presentation was immaculate. I had the duck, and let's just say, a \"steak knife\" was unnecessary. It fell apart while only using a fork! Delicious! I forgot what the dessert was called, but the sliced almonds, house made whip, and fresh blueberry ensemble was something to brag about. All-in-all, a FIVE-STAR experience. I CANNOT WAIT TO COME BACK, and will be recommending this establishment to everyone."}
{"text":"Wonderful ambiance and incredible menu. The salad was one of the best creations I've tasted and I was very impressed with the homemade dressing. I tried the mid course pork belly and it was good but over cooked. Not enough to be disappointed but more than I would expect for this caliber of restaurant. Overall great place and I would return."}
{"text":"I don't actually know where to begin. First off, I love food. And it absolutely blows my mind that this place was an expertly crafted crescendo, with each course building in perfect symphonic glory. I feel high as I say this. This is the kind of place you go to when you want to be shown that you have never actually had a gourmet meal before. Like. I thought I had? I've dined in 5-star restaurants all over the world. Let me be Frank. Or Sinead. Because seriously Restaurant Progress, nothing compares to you. 

Legitimately,  and with my whole heart, I didn't know food could taste this good. 

The ambiance, and aesthetic is perfect. It's romantic and beautiful and understated. Yet somehow every detail is bespoke. From the elegant wall art to the exposed beams and Edison bulbs. I'm a designer, so believe me when I say that this place is designed with every detail thoughtfully expressed for the ultimate experience. 

We had the tasting menu. I recommend it a billion times. I'm actually still stunned as I sit here contemplating the sheer value ratio for the price point. All together we tried TEN different gourmet dishes, each of them worthy of royalty. Each one better than the one before it. For $150 for two. I am baffled at how we got away with this. It seemed genuinely worth at least twice the price. Because it was the best meal I've ever had in my entire life.

The service was impeccable. She was so skillful and intuitive and seemed to read our minds. I'd had a craving for duck and she was able to arrange that as one of our entrees even though it's supposed to be chef's choice. 

Please just go to this place. Get the tasting menu and sit back in love-drunken bliss while you ponder how you've never actually had food before."}
