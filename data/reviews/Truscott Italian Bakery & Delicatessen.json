{"text":"Great selection of baked goods and also lots of amazing items from Italy and Europe. They have a small cafe with few seats. A great place to check out."}
{"text":"Their gnocchi is absolutely delicious! Their desserts aren't bad at all... But not the best Italian pastries out there."}
{"text":"Very nice bakery, been here a bunch of times over the years. What first brought me here were the Cannoli. Some of the better Cannoli you will find in the GTA. I've had pretty much most of what their bakery offers, all is well made. 

A few times I've gotten lunch at the hot table, it's good but a little too overpriced for my liking. Nice selection of goods to by in their grocery section, good parking and nice staff as well."}
{"text":"Came here specifically to try their pastries and I wasn't disappointed! 

Firstly, it was easy to locate with ample parking in a visible stand alone section of a strip mall on Truscott Drive. The exterior looked like it had been recently done and I thought it looked nice and inviting.

Once you enter, the left side of the bakery is a grocery/retail section which looked well stocked with items that you won't normally find in regular stores however, since I was in a hurry and on a pastry mission, I didn't stop to browse. Then I crossed the bread corner, which caught my eye and looked and smelled tempting. The hot dishes section came next which didn't entice me too much since I'm vegetarian. Further ahead was the all important pastry case and luckily there were two cannolis left so my trip wasn't in vain. I didn't want to appear greedy so I just took just one each of a cannoli, chocolate eclair, portuguese tart, tira misu and red velvet cupcake. On the way out I spotted the coffee machine and couldn't help order an americano as well. At the cash, I was told there was a discount if I ordered 6 pastries - so I promptly took the last cannoli as well :D Everything was reasonably priced and I remember paying less than $20 in total.  

I was helped by three staff members and all of them were exceedingly polite and friendly. I enjoyed my brief visit to the bakery and would recommend it highly just for the unique Italian-Canadian experience. The real icing on the cake of course was the taste and quality of all the pastries...everything was enjoyable but the cannoli and eclair were phenomenal! Can't wait to go back for more but I better hit the gym first."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the freshly baked goods specially the donuts and croissants.
In regards to the hot table, most of the dishes are bland. Pasta tastes very generic."}
{"text":"We moved in across the street and fell in love with this place. Everyday I walk across and buy the best sugar bun. Unfortunately they are so good they go fast and are not always available. Pasta is excellent and filling. Chicken is delicious. Nothing can beat fresh baking!

Love the new expanded building!"}
{"text":"I stumbles into Truscott's a year ago while out shopping with relatives who had come to town. I have been back 5 times and it is REALLY good. Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I'm sure you will agree, there's nothing quite like freshly baked bread; the smell, the taste, the warmth, it's all so very good! 

I recently discovered Truscott Italian Bakery & Deli - a charming little bakery in Clarkson. It's been there for many years but they recently did a refresh and boy it looks great! 

I ended up buying a few of their mini cakes for dessert the other day. 
Not only did they look good, they were pretty tasty too. (I had one too many that day)

Then there's their deli meat counter which boasts a variety of European meats. (Ask for a free sample). Moving on to the grocery section, they have a huge selection of pastas, sauces, fancy imported drinks (lemonades and juices), fresh eggs, dairy items and of course a massive collection of olive oils.  

This is a great place to pick up last minute grocery essentials, freshly baked bread and maybe a specialty coffee on the way out."}
{"text":"Great Bread! Some things are a bit pricey but their cakes and cannolies are a taste sensation, worth the extra. Everything is excellent quality"}
{"text":"Authentic Italian place and the staff is very friendly. The hot lunch items are excellent. You can also buy home made sauces etc there for reasonable prices. Good Italian dessert options."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for pastries and breads, and though this bakery is about 2 minutes from my house, in 20 years I never tried this local bakery. This morning though I took a little detour on my way to work and jumped in to see what they had.

They have a number of baked pastries including strudels, doughnuts, croissants, cinnamon buns and cookies. Prices were $1.50 per pastry (or $8 for 6) and $0.80 per cookie. I tried a doughnut and chocolate croissant, and while both were OK, but they didn't stand out from what you could get at any other bakery, or even your local supermarket. They weren't bad though. To be fair, I don't have a toaster oven at work to heat up the croissant. 

They sold pies for $7, but when asked when they were baked they said last Wed or Thurs, so I didn't pick one up. the lady said they usually bake them once a week.  I wouldn't be surprised if they did that with a lot of their pastries and baked goods. 

They had some buns as well that looked alright, and sold delis and meats as well.  Nothing looked especially good, pretty standard fare.

You get a free pound cake if you spend more then $30 at the bakery. (while quantities last).

So to sum up, if you live in the area it's not a bad bakery and you'd get fresher food than the Food Basics that is in the same plaza, but the prices are average for a bakery or supermarket. You may want to ask when they make a fresh batch of baked goods so you can time it and get freshly baked goods."}
{"text":"I've been to this quite allot and previous to going to it, I didn't hear many good things about it. 

Let m break it down - bread is delicious and fresh. 

Hot Table - it's bland, looks reheated and greasy. They serve arancini but they are so unauthentic they call them rice balls and if you do call them arancini they girls behind the counter just stare at you. I've had almost everything there and one of the worst things there is their meatballs with taste like pulverized meat without any sort of seasoning or fat.The pasta are incredibly bland and the sausage has an odd mealy texture instead of being hearty and juicy. 

I always get the chicken parm and potatoe wedges. 

The coffee - is terrible. The barista is adorable and incredibly very very nice - he's the young guy who just looks like he can't wait for his break. However even on his break he works and is always lending a helping hand. 

The cashiers are genuinely nice and happy to see you from my multiple experiences. 

However I will not be returning. The last time I was there, a middle aged man took it upon himself follow me around the store and refuse to give me my purchase or coffee till I finished at the cash register. That's not how I've ever been treated prior to and I felt very aware that I was the only coloured person in the store and he only did that for me. 

Overall - just go to Food Basics or the Tims down the street."}
{"text":"Been a customer since they open I find the new renovation has brought the price up on the items but still good food ,I like their Saturday roast beef sandwich ,the staff and owners are always courteous and attentive to your comments"}
{"text":"Amazing family bakery
It was good before and is perfect now
A great addition to the parkroyal neibourhood 
Don't go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Well the Deli meat is decent as are the pastries and bread ..defiantly no complaints on that . HOWEVER the hot table although looks good ...tastes mediocre and the portions are small !! Whoever says best sandwiches in the area  obviously hasn't been around ! 
The veal sandwiches are small half the size of there competitors in the area ! I mean I guess if the price was half then it would be ok but for the price I think it be the same size ! Just sayin ...
Some staff is unfriendly mostly the cashiers .
Just be aware of the portions they give you at the hot table considering your paying premium prices."}
{"text":"This place surprised me with its variety. Located in Mississauga's Clarkson Village (aka suburbia), this Italian bakery and deli is a small grocery-store-bakery-pastry-shop-deli-lunch spot, all in one large plaza near Southdown Road and Lakeshore Road West (a major intersection close by is Winston Churchill and the QEW).

First, parking. This is located in a large plaza so you won't have trouble finding parking. 

Second, the environment and selection. They have a good selection of breads, dinner rolls, garlic rolls, baguettes. They also have a large shelf filled with a moderate variety of freshly made pastries - chocolate croissants, muffins, apple fritters, a couple of donuts, among others. It isn't the greatest variety in the world, but you definitely have stuff to choose from. There's also a hot table with a good selection of lunch options - sandwiches, pastas, sausage rolls, were among some of the offerings on a day I visited. There's also a small counter towards the front with about 5 stools where you can enjoy your lunch.

I purchased the stuffed pasta with alfredo sauce, and 4 pastries (2 chocolate croissants, a sugar bun, and a cinnamon roll). The pastries were actually quite good - not the best ever, but still hit the spot! Very soft and fresh, chewy - the chocolate croissant was stuffed with chocolate, and when I popped one in the microwave this evening, it was positively oozing with melted chocolate... which.... yum. Delicious.

Overall, decent selection and great service. However, note that it's definitely a bit pricier than other Italian bakeries out there - for a takeout box of pasta and 4 pastries, I paid around $17.00 (the pasta itself was $7.99 and the pastries were $1.99 each). 

Also note: if you buy 6 pastries, you don't pay tax on them."}
{"text":"Great family run place giving fresh made bread and other hard to find specialty Italian items
THE JALAPENO CORN BREAD is amazing for all you spicy lovers!!!"}
{"text":"TIP:  Plaza entrance off Bodmin is slightly closer and you don't hafta drive around as many vehicles near the grocery store!

***Rating based on cannoli/Americano and customer service only.***

This Clarkson institution is in an interesting area.  It's a mix of really low and high-ish income housing.  Neighbouring towns/apartment buildings look rundown, but houses are being renovated, so the plaza is indicative of this neighbourhood undergoing a rejuvenation.  

The bakery itself has recently undergone some renos which includes exterior facelift as well as addition of indoor seating to enjoy your food from the hot table &/or espresso with pastry.

TONS of parking abound.  You will not find this amount of surface parking in newer strip malls.

Male server was RIGHT THERE as I looked at the showcases of goodies.  He was proactive in asking whether or not I needed help.  He did his job and got me to buy something.  I did not have to search or ask anyone for help. 

Prices, in terms of what I purchased were in-line with other Italian bakeries that I go to.  Cannoli - 1 sz - was $1.99 and Americano was like $2.25 or something like that.  I did not really pay attention of prices for the other items.

Cannoli actually had a CRUNCHY shell which is a good sign.  I've had soggy ones, not cool.  Stuffing was also light and not too sweet.  Americano was ok, similar to that of San Remo.

If you're in the area, this is a SOLID choice...although I don't think there's any other alternatives!"}
{"text":"Hot bar had such good choices that we went two nights in a row!  Great pasta, chicken parm, lasagne and saussage rolls.  

The fresh pastry offerings were so good that we took a box to go.  Watch what might be stale in that area. Flavor was good just maybe a little hard.

We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"We've been to Truscott Italian Bakery & Delicatessen a few times. To be fair, we've only had one item on the menu so I can only speak about that. I think it speaks volumes that we've ordered the same item for 3 visits in a row. Obviously it's delicious! We had the frozen espresso drink, which is more or less like a very thick frappuccino (or almost a soft serve coffee ice cream). It's thick and delicious with a great espresso flavour. It's served in a small glass with a teaspoon, or in a take out cup with a straw (but really is too thick to suck through the straw). I highly recommend it on a hot summer day. 

This is also a bakery and small grocery store, with fresh bread and deli meats and lots of other grocery items (including some gluten-free cookies and crackers). 

We brought the puppy on one of our visits and were told immediately that we could take her out onto the patio and they also brought her a dish of water. Very friendly staff and great service!"}
{"text":"Nice local bakery. Not everything is made by them but a lot of stuff is. I love their canolis."}
{"text":"Found it on Yelp! As I needed a quick but quality lunch while working remotely at a local library. Delicious panini with prosciutto and spinach on a Calabrese bun, accompanied by a cappuccino. All under $10! And very filling 
Their pastries look decadent, and would love to return to try those one day. They also have a great dessert selection, including small cakes, cookies, and mini desserts. Picked up some buns and parmesan and parsley bread sticks so look forward to trying those!"}
