{"text":"This nekter location I have noticed is much busier than the other locations, but I don't mind coming to this location because of the consistency of my smoothie and service received. Candice, the girl with all the tattoos makes an amazing date but smoothie that at any other location does not taste so satisfying. If you go in ask for her, I do, I promise you won't be disappointed and she has an amazing memory for remembering who are and what you ordered!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped in this afternoon after meaning to for months! it's right next to European Wax Center, and it's got a nice little outdoor seating area. the inside was very clean and a nice place to chat and eat, kind of reminds me of a Jamba Juice, but more modern? I got the acai bowl with peanut butter, and it was absolutely fantastic. the fruit was fresh, the granola was very good and so was the yogurt with the peanut butter. you can literally taste the healthiness in the bowl! the service was very quick and the counter girl was super friendly and sweet. I will definitely be back in again!"}
{"text":"The acai bowls are so good! I got the peanut butter and I wouldn't change anything about it. Great for after workout or breakfast. Also have great juices. Wish I could have this every morning!"}
{"text":"First experience wasn't a good one...unfortunately I wasn't even able to experience the product...waited in line for more than 10 minutes, staff was overwhelmed and struggling to even take care of what appeared to be the orders they had. Lots of customers waiting around...maybe next time even though I highly doubt there will be one based on this experience...unfortunate, I had high expectations."}
{"text":"This review is based on my visit on July 12th, 2015.

I visited this juice bar based on numerous recommendations from friends and family and I must say I'm glad I did! This location had a very trendy, modern feel to it. The seating consisted of high top tables and bars with a long booth as well. Very nice, eclectic beats really complimented the experience. I found it very nice that there was a wall that separated the kitchen area from the seating area, as it made the atmosphere much quieter. Behind the cashier, there were many baskets filled with fresh produce, adding to that fresh, clean atmosphere and feel of the restaurant.

The service was great for an order-at-the-counter type of restaurant. As I arrived at the counter, it was apparent that I was absolutely clueless on what to order, and the cashier actually asked if I needed any recommendations. He was very thorough in his explanations of what he recommended in each \"category,\" explaining more than just his favorite one or two items - really great service! 

In the end, I took one of his recommendations and ordered the \"Pink Flamingo,\" a smoothie made from strawberries, pitaya (dragon fruit), agave nectar, pineapple, and coconut water. While I waited for my drink, there was complimentary citrus water available, a nice touch. Now, the only negative was that it took quite a while for my drink to be ready, despite the empty restaurant. It was completely worth it! The smoothie tasted fresh, was packed with flavor, looked bright, and filled me up just perfectly. Another person in my group ordered a bowl, which was huge for the price and still contained very few calories.

I'm obsessed with this place now and can't wait to go back! Maybe next time I will be a little bit more adventurous and order something with more vegetables in it! If you're looking for a trendy, healthy, clean place to go with friends or just a nice place to order a smoothie or some juice, you HAVE TO visit Nekter!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I had an hour break together (we work at Fashion Square Mall) and decided to get of the vibe. We went North on Scottsdale road arrived quickly at Nekter. I've never been to a juice bar before but I make my own at home, and they were so delicious. We got one of each kind for my coworkers and I really loved my order of The Greenie. The PB acai bowl was incredible (my favorite was how it was topped in hempseed granola). All-around just a healthy and fresh lunch. We had a great time, the workers are very friendly and the atmosphere is unique. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Girl at the counter way extremely helpful and my mango smoothie is amazing  I'll definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Bought a juice out of the fridge and guess what.....expired a day before I bought it. Good thing I caught it before I got sick."}
{"text":"two thumbs up to the acai banana berry bowl! loved the atmosphere of this juice bar. I also tried the glow which was one of the juices featured. the celery in the juice was the dominate flavor so if you don't like celery I wouldn't recommend getting it. As for customer service... well could be a lot better, when I ordered my drink the girl had some attitude. Not hearing my order the first time  because the blenders were loud she responded bluntly with \"WHAT?\"  definitely not an appropriate way you talk to customers. I will be back for the acai bowl but hopefully I will have better service next time."}
{"text":"I've come in a couple of times and always had positive experiences. The staff is super friendly and always makes my business feel appreciated and they make it known that they value their customers. It's a bit pricey but I used to work at a smoothie place so I know how it works."}
{"text":"Good smoothies and juices but only 1 person doing the job.....ordered a smoothie and waited 30 min, this is the 2nd time it happens. Not worth the wait, don't come here if you are in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Best healthy smoothie ever on a hot summer day in Vegas. The service was luke-warm and slow but it gave us time to cool down."}
{"text":"I ordered the health nut smoothie. I had the almond butter base over peanut. It was great at first. Nice flavor, good consistency.  Halfway through it got really watery, diluted. I had huge chunks of bananas and big pieces of ice at the bottom. For 6.50 it was sub par. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Hands down, best acai bowl in Vegas! It took me right back to Hawaii when I had my very first one! A must-try when you go to Downtown Summerlin. I haven't tried anything else here because the acai bowl has kept me so content and always coming back for more."}
{"text":"I have been to this location several times, and every time I get wonderful fast service and a delicious juice on the go. I have also tried their 3 day cleanse and it felt amazing, highly recommend. If you haven't tried the ice cream yet, you are missing out. I preferred the chocolate, however both were great."}
{"text":"What's not to love! Best smoothies in town-home made cashew milk-no refined sugar in any of their products.  Cold Brew coffees are delicious too.  I can't even pick a fav out of the smoothies-they are all great!   And the new Skoop cashew milk ice cream is a must!  Chocolate Skoop, strawberry skoop-yes to everything on the menu.  Locations are super clean, friendly employees, great rewards program-Nekter is the best in town for juices, smoothies, acai bowls & healthy snacks."}
{"text":"Love this place great customer service the acai bowl is amazing and the toxin flush!! Love it"}
{"text":"Love that they finally have something healthy near Las Sendas. Cashew milk smoothies are delicious. Ask for the Date Nut. It's not on the menu. I wish they had the mint carob chip more often than just in December."}
{"text":"Great juices great customer service. Every time I come in I'm never disappointed. Always a good experience"}
{"text":"They are very hard workers, friendly and remember who I am. So when I pre order and go to pick it up. I don't have to ask they just get it and give it to me."}
{"text":"Friendly, happy staff. This place is clean and organized. Their acai bowls are delicious . I have never tried the smoothies, b/c I am an acai kind of girl, so I can't speak to those. BUT the bowls are awesome. I like the banana berry bowl (I add coconut) best. The tropical is also very good. I give 4 instead of 5 b/c I don't think there is enough berry on top of the berry bowl. I've ordered tons of acai bowls from many different places, and this place FOR SURE gives the fewest berries on top. AND they do not have a phone yet (?!?). I tried to call in a big order of berry bowls, but could find no number. I was directed to a voicemail from a corporate 1-800 number. So, I'm knocking off a star for the lack of berries and because phone-in orders are not an option. Otherwise, this place is great! Authentic ingredients and creative mixtures. I Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Detox Flush--very good! I waited for 20 minutes and then when I asked about the status of my order, I was told by the employee at the register, \"Just got here, I don't know\". Eventually got the drink, 25 minutes after ordering. Crazy for a 24 ounce juice."}
{"text":"Heard great things about Nekter over the weekend and was excited to try it.  Went in this morning and was disappointed to learn that they do not use organic produce!  Knowing that a bottle of cold pressed juice takes about 6 lbs of produce to make, I cannot imagine how many pesticides are in that bottle!  
To be fair, I left the shop without a purchase so I cannot comment on taste but will stick with a local organic juice shop!"}
{"text":"The customer service is great! Got the acai berry bowl and a kids pink flamingo for my daughter, both were delicious! Will definitely be my go to stop from now on."}
{"text":"Coming here was the highlight of my day at the aquarium (poor little sea creatures)!!
They have fresh juices, smoothies and acai bowls. 
Love smoothies and juices filled with fresh fruits and fresh veggies ( just wish they were organic ).
I am happy to see more of these type of establishments popping up !! Fruits and veggies are life, they give us life !! 
Beautiful and clean but a little ironic that they share a space with the chocolate company."}
{"text":"First time and won't be my last.  Told them what generally have at home and more than helpful to guide me to first juice.  Yummy.  Very helpful, professional and personable."}
{"text":"I am an avid juicer at home and usually hate paying high prices at the new cold press juice bars.  Nekter is a great deal, great options and amazing prices."}
{"text":"Went in there today.  Asked the girl if the fruits and veggies were organic. \"No\" was the answer.  Why spend $8.50 for a cup full of juice that has pesticides? Seems like at that price their product should be organic.   I will not go back."}
{"text":"I have tried most of the juices & they all taste great. Service has always been good and George is one of the most pleasant people you will ever meet, he makes the place. Such a great concept but I had to stop going there once I realized they are not using organic products. Organic is so important especially when your consuming such concentrated quantities. People juice to be healthy and organic is a must. So sad to no longer have Nektar as my go to place. Two stars for them not putting in the extra effort."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of juiciers after this place.  Plus I love the decor and interesting way of hanging baskets of fruit and veggies.  Very modern concept, great prices compared to jamba juice or whole foods."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.

Their juices and smoothies are fantastic and their cleanses are amazing."}
{"text":"We had the smoothie with greens added in a bowl. It was very tart. Was expensive! Due to allregies we have to be careful. We requested the gluten-free granola. Not sure if they properly delivered on that one because we experienced a bad reaction later on in the day....so if you're like us maybe try something different if you go. We would go again just to try the juices. They looked good."}
{"text":"I just want to say thank you to Nikki and the staff at Nektar Juice Bar at Village Center Circle. They are so knowledgeable about everything on their menu and VERY friendly. Every time you go in there, they always have smiles on their faces. I am so happy that I tried their toxin flush. It is AMAZING and it definitely makes a difference in my life. Needless to say, I made some new friends. They really do care about you and your health! Thank you Nikki and staff!! I am a regular customer now and it's great!! It's hard to get exceptional customer service these days for sure. You guys rock!!  Keep up the good work! Life is good with you in it!! 

Diane T."}
{"text":"The ladies here were very helpful and very energetic. The product is always good. Its so refreshing coming in. And even tho they had a small crowd they gave everyone attention."}
{"text":"So far so good.  Since their opening, I have already been here 3 times.  It is nice to have a juice bar so close to home.  I have tried every category of the menu: juice, smoothie, acai bowl.  Favorites so far are the sublime juice and the acai banana berry bowl.  Beware, the bowl is big.  The juices taste fresh and the sitting space is kept clean.  Service is friendly.  Prices are in line with the last juice bar I visited - Whole Foods.  I can't wait to try other juices and bowls."}
{"text":"The acai bowl here is good.  Much better than most of the bowls here in town.  

Definitely is a good choice here or Acai to the T.

Hopefully one day Las Vegas will get a real authentic acai bowl like the ones in Hawaii.  Where the acai berries will shine as the star of the bowl and not by some crappy super sweet concentrated juice."}
{"text":"Love this place and their drinks but shocked by the rude and slow service. Hopefully the holiday cheer will kick in."}
{"text":"Great juice bar! Staff is very friendly. Although when it's packed it takes some time to get your order, the wait is worth it!

Highly recommend the PB Bowl!"}
{"text":"The bowls are good, but the service is absolutely horrible. I placed an order through the app at 12, and it said it would be ready by 12:30. I got to Nékter at that time to pick it up, and the girl in there didn't even start my order yet. I had plans at 1, but instead I had to wait yet another 30 minutes for her to complete my order. Since when does it take an hour to make 2 bowls?? I have been to Nékter several times, and every time there is the same girl in there. Judging by other negative reviews of the service at this establishment, I assume quite a bit of people are referring to this same girl. She seems absolutely MISERABLE to be working there. I honestly wonder if the manager has ever seen her work before, because I sure as hell wouldn't have someone like that as an employee. She takes forever to acknowledge someone, let alone take their order, and she is rude about everything she does. It is sad because although I absolutely love the bowls, the customer service is just horrible. I've been very surprised that the same negative people work there, considering the store is losing lots of customers due to employee attitude."}
{"text":"I like their smoothies however their app and client program not fair. If I go in and buy 1 product I get 1 point. 10 points gets you a freebie. To save time I buy my smoothies for two days at a time along with 2 for spouse. I only get 1 point. So if I asked them to ring up separately I'd get 4 points. Not fair."}
{"text":"When you walk in the place, just the smell makes you fell healthy. I have had the acai bowls and several juices, all were great. The atmosphere is laid back and well decorated."}
{"text":"Super sad that the desert ridge location has gone down hill. Slow service, but the bigger issue is the cleanliness. It's a mess and I watched them use dirty utensils and blenders."}
{"text":"I've had Nekter juice at different locations and it really is quite good. This particular location receives a one star rating for the service. I went to this location at 12:45, a prime time for a lunch rush, there was one employee at the register. I waited in line for ten minutes before I left with no juice. During my 10 minutes in the store, only 3 people placed orders at the register and only 2 orders were served. Overall a very frustrating experience considering I had to return to work with an empty stomach. Put some employees at the register during obvious rush hours and my review will probably be a 4-5 star rating."}
{"text":"I can't really say anything bad about this place, all of the drinks are pretty good. The acai bowls are my favorite though. And for the most part, its never crowded to the point of having to wait. Quick efficient service!"}
{"text":"Popeyes Acai smoothie

Recommend by one of the girls working there. 
Acai, banana, spinach, homemade cashew milk, agave nectar 

Delicious drink. You taste more of the cashew and banana. Regular size, wish it was $4.xx instead of $5.xx

Good variety of juices and smoothies. Will definitely go back."}

{"text":"Quick service. Nice employees. A little bit expensive. But if you want a healthy smoothie this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place is great! Simple, fresh, and the acai bowls are a MUST try. A welcome addition to the Gray Hawk area for sure."}
{"text":"I never been to Nekter but I have to say it's not nearly as good as Thrive. I got the Sun Devil and it was very dull. There was way to much smoothie that had no flavor and hardly any toppings. The only toppings included were banana, strawberry and berries and barely any granola. It was not filling. It needs more of a kick. Thrive is better because they add honey and they have way more options."}
{"text":"Outstanding staff, incredible customer service, and did I mention the best pumpkin smoothies for the holiday season!!!  Highly recommended.....every employee goes above and beyond to take care of their customers...far from the norm these days!  I'm a Nékter junkie thanks to everyone at the Hayden road location!!!  GB"}
{"text":"Issues-man, this is overpriced. Not even organic or local (I imagine they'd advertise if it was). Saw some of their bottled (16 oz?) juices and drinks in display case. $6 for a cold pressed coffee?!?! Also, and the real reason for my complaint. Charged an extra $1 to add greens to my acai banana bowl. Total comes out to nearly $10 with tax which is absurd for the product and quantity. To top things off the handful of spinach I'm charged extra for isn't event blended in! Nothing like some soggy spinach leaves to turn your stomach."}
{"text":"I never did the clense, but had smoothies, juices and bowls. Its a bit pricey, but fresh. I can here the employees juicing away in the back. The pitaya bowls are delish! I crave them."}
{"text":"Excellent, helpful customer service. I was trying to decide between two drinks and they were helpful and friendly when answering my questions. I ordered The Buzz and it tasted great. It took a few sips for me to get used to the ginger, but after that it didn't bother me."}
{"text":"Great place! There are a lot of choices here from a protein shake to more of a smoothie and the best acai bowls! The service here is always great and things are ready quick!"}
{"text":"So stoked this place finally migrated from the sunny beaches of southern cal to AZ.  Everything is so delicious, most notable the Acai bowls.  Super good and healthy"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for a quick breakfast that's good for you. They offer a variety of juices, smoothies and bowls. I went with the Toxin Flush juice, so good! They even have promotions through their app that reward you the more you show up! Definitely worth stopping by to try out. Wish we had more of these places in Los Angeles!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for a refreshing drink! Staff was very nice! I'll be back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time and it was great! Great place to get a healthy refreshing drink. Will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Hi!!! I haven't been yet, but it sure looks & sounds awesome. 
Is there a menu with prices on your website?
It would sure help (:

If there is, I cannot seem to find it.
All I see are cleanse packages and gift cards (: 
Thank you so much!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Amazing quality, fresh ingredient, handmade juice. The only issue is that they frequently often don't open on time, so I can't depend on them for my pre-work/breakfast juice!"}
{"text":"Customer service is lackluster and I've been served half empty bowls. The girl behind the counter acts like she's doing you a favor and won't give you so much as a smile or a \"hello\" and \"thank you.\" I love their pitaya bowls but I might just start getting them from Chop Shop instead and forgo the attitude at Nekter."}
{"text":"Never been a huge fan of juicing, but man the açai bowls are amazing. Almost like a frozen version of yogurt and granola, they contain similar ingredients to a few of their other smoothies, but with a soft-serve consistency. The employees were polite, helpful, and willing to make anything just the way you want it. Coming back for sure, would be a great spot to get homework too."}
{"text":"Samantha was great! She filled me in on great promotions and the acai and juices are awesome here!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Super healthy and reasonably priced. I used to go to the ones in Cali and im so happy they opened stores in phx! They have A friendly and helpful staff. Always quick. The greenie (green juice) add cayenne pepper is my absolute favorite! Also the bowls are awesome and really feeling! Favorite bowl is the PB Bowl! They have grab and go drinks & snacks as well! This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"First time at Nektar juice bar, my first impression was that the place was very clean and the service was great. The only thing I found that it was confusing was that instead of calling the order by number or by someone's name they just called out the name of the item that was ordered. That could be very confusing for people that ordered the same item."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place. It is really cozy and beautiful inside. You're a healthier version of yourself right when you walk in! 
The produce is fresh and you can tell everyone who works there is health conscious and knowledgeable. 
I ordered the green apple detox and the almond butter acai bowl. Both were delicious - I will say the bowl was big and I wish it had more of the bananas and granola in it. Because of its size, the acai tends to melt and became soupy. Overall though it was very good. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"So, so good! All of the bowls are delicious and have great flavor! The bowl with spinach and kale is delicious and you would never know there are greens in it. The ginger shot is so fresh tasting. All of the juices and smoothies are great as well! There is nothing you can go wrong with here. I love that they are open late, too! I wish there was one in Seattle!"}
{"text":"Love the Acai bowls! Was in first thing when they opened on a Sunday morning. The cashier was friendly. Another person who was actually making some of my order was either super tired or didn't like her job. I asked for agave on the side, she said they didn't have containers to have that on the side.  Also this place is a bit pricey but worth the price for the product in my opinion!"}
{"text":"My beef with this place is its so dang slow!!  I'm going to stop coming I think. It literally takes 15+ minutes to get a small juice!  Definitely not convenient or speedy. I hate to say it bc I do like the juices but I don't have time to wait for them. I guess it's back to whole foods or juby true :("}
{"text":"Good bowls and smoothies. My only complaint is that I don't like \"feel good healthy\" places that don't share nutritional facts or calories. The majority of people eat this to eat healthy and they don't have any information here or on their website."}
{"text":"Amazing juices and smoothies. I love the chocolate dream, but you can't go wrong with any of their options. Healthy with no added sugars, fast service, and always tastes great. They open late on Saturdays which is a bummer, but overall I love this place! They sometimes have specials on their juice cleanses and special holiday options so I love to follow along on their instagram."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the acai bowls here for a while now so I was glad when I finally had the opportunity to try one out.
I got the superfood acai bowl, which is one of their new bowls, and it was topped with bananas, blueberries, strawberries, goji berries, cacao nibs, granola and bee pollen. It was a very sizeable bowl and the toppings on it were delicious but the base tasted a bit icy to me. However, that may have been because I started eating it right after I got it. It's also hard to compare because the only other acai bowls I've had are in Hawaii where they were using fresh fruit for the base instead of frozen fruit."}
{"text":"I work in the center (Tempe Marketplace) and stop here at least once a week. They are always friendly and helpful. If something goes wrong (which is rare) they offer to go above and beyond to fix it. :) 
Sometimes the new guys aren't sure how to interact at the register; but that will fade with time and experience. Overall I've never had a bad experience and their product is always fresh and delightful! I love their pancake cookies, too. Great job to whoever is managing this place!"}
{"text":"I ordered a acai banana berry bowl and after I had ordered they were telling customers they were running low and acai and couldn't make any more bowls. So when I got my bowl after 15 min of waiting I found out that most of my acai bowl was granola. Someone else complained and I over heard the split one acai bowl into 3. So I payed 8$ for 1/3 of a regular acai bowl. They could've let me order something different or gave me a refund."}
{"text":"I just went into Nektar to order the new mango acai bowl and specifically asked for no agave on top, the girl who gave me my bowl handed it to me and I asked her after looking at the bowl if it had any a agave on it as I could see it, she then told me \"no. When I cut the fruit it just looks like that.\" Then turned around back into the kitchen and whispered to the other girl working that she did put it on there and went into the back. I stood there and ask them again if she put it on top and she came out and said she did after lying to me. Come on Nektar. You're supposed to have employees with good morals."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Always fresh tasty products.  Warm friendly staff.  Excellent management.  Can't say enough good things about this place. Most importantly always brought my dog a bowl of water when I ordered."}
{"text":"Went to Nekter today, looking forward to an Acai Berry Bowl, something I've had a few times before. They've always been filled to the top, covered with bananas, fruit and granola. Price, $8.95. A perfect lunch after a hike or after a workout. Today was no different, except that my bowl was half the normal amount! I asked what happened to my bowl, literally half the size, (but the same price) and was told that that was the amount it is now. It's been changed. I was so disappointed and can't understand how a business can cut their product in half and keep it the same price. Not good business in my book and I won't be returning. They've lost a customer. Too bad. I really liked going to Nékter, but won't spend my money there."}
{"text":"Didn't even get my juice. I had to be somewhere at 10:45am. Got here at 9:50 ordered a juice was told it would be five minutes. After twenty minutes went up to see if mine was almost done. The lady said she was making mine next. After another 15 minutes. She made the wrong juice. Was there for over 35 minutes and had to lave without a juice. Can't comment on if the juice is good or not cause I never received mine. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Update: went to nektar again the other day (hoping they'd prove me wrong about their customer service skills) and I probably stood in front of the register for about 10 minutes while 2 girls behind the counter talked and completely ignored me. Not even so much as a \"we'll be with you in a moment.\" Just pretended I wasn't there."}
{"text":"I don't like the app but other than that it's good. Best location at making smoothies in the area"}
{"text":"I don't get it, acai bowls did not taste right. All three of us were disappointed. Looked like a couple corporate folks sitting in one of the two low top tables. Not sure what help they were providing. If I was the franchisor I would not be a happy camper. For goodness sake get out of the way of paying customers so there is a place to sit and train the staff whom are friendly but clearly not yet trained on correctly making the acai bowls!"}
{"text":"Delicious and refreshing. Great place to refuel and detoxify. It would be better if it was all organic. 

It was a little hectic at 1 on Wednesday when I visited but they were all working hard! Wish we had one in Denver."}
{"text":"I enjoy it here. Great prices for what you get and the product is fantastic every time. Try the PB balls, love them !"}
{"text":"I've gone to one of these places in California and loved it so when I found out that there is one I'm summerlin I had to come out. The employees were a little too nice. Willing to help me out with everything and anything. I ordered a pink flamingo and it was absolutely amazing. Watching them juice the items right there in front of me as well as making the complete drink made me feel like I am getting what I paid for. I Will never go back to Jamba juice or any of those other places. It's not worth it. Believe me when I say that this place owns all. YOU HAVE A LIFE TIME CUSTOMER NEKTAR!!!!!"}
{"text":"It was my first time to have a \"green juice\". I was advised to ask for double apple to make it sweeter. It was surprisingly tasty- I just wish it was colder."}
{"text":"I love this place! First time in and I got the greenie juice and the pb bowl. Both were delicious and the bowl was big enough for two meals. I could only eat half before putting it in my fridge to eat more later. I feel refreshed and charged and it's only 2 minutes from my house. I believe it's my new favorite and I'm glad I found a real juice bar close by."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PLACE! Being that I work right next door it's the perfect morning spot to get all the goods in! The pink flamingo and the PB Açaí bowl are my daily favorites! The staff is very nice! There regional manager was the sweetest woman! Great place! Cute atmosphere! Everything rocks! Clean! And it's clean, I'm super weird about places being clean and this one is! Great job Nékter!!!"}
{"text":"I visited this juice bar on a day that was considerably busy. They recently opened and it was lunchtime. Service is relatively quick, they got the juice out in about five minutes or so. The staff was helpful and informative. I thought the juice cleanses tasted great. Would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"On my last visit here I ordered a green juice...specifically the greenie. First off the guy at the counter made me extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome. He really made the experience not worth while at all. However another guy helped me out and got my juice started while the cashier guy was being unfriendly to yet another customer. I usually like this kind of juice because it always makes me energized and I know it is healthy. As soon as I got it I was excited to try it and see if it was better than the other ones I have tried. I was extremely disappointed. This tasted DISGUSTING. It had no appetizing taste at all when even on the menu it said that apples are added to at least sweeten the gosh darn thing. I only drank about a quarter of a small one and the whole time I kept wanting to throw up and I couldn't swallow it. I felt like I had wasted my money and not even had that great of service. I like the one by Scottsdale Quarter better. The workers are always friendly and make my drinks actually appetizing and make me not feel like I wasted my money. They aren't cheap either so this really was a unsatisfactory visit."}
{"text":"Great selection of fresh ingredients. Very friendly staff on Easter morning. Current prices for açai bowls is $7.95 very reasonable or $9.95 for açai superfood bowl. Also have good selection of juices and smoothies. 
Space is clean and good variety of seating including barstool tables and lounge area plus a nook for a large group of 6-8 if they are very friendly."}
{"text":"Obsessed with their Toxin Flush freshly squeezed juice. They are always super nice when I come in. I've been to multiple locations across the valley and none compare to this location. The staff is friendly, helpful and the place is always very clean."}
{"text":"I love Nékter and look forward to a healthy treat. I have gone to this location quite a few times now, and I not impressed with their customer service. Disappointed in the unfriendliness of the staff almost every time I stop in. I will drive a little farther to another location to have a better experience."}
{"text":"Very helpful! Never been to a nekter before and they helped explain the different drinks we were looking at and had suggestions. The drinks were good. Put only complaint was price..but it was all natural juice so that was expected!"}
{"text":"Great!!! First time in today. And I am enjoying my \"pink flamingo\" shake right now. The employees are very nice.  Clean store.  Many many options for shakes and juices.  Five stars."}
{"text":"Great service and great drinks! Love how its all fresh produce.  The ginger shot is potent!"}
{"text":"I almost gave it 3 stars because the pink flamingo smoothie was tasty, but overall it was a 2 star experience. 
There was poor customer service and I didn't feel any good vibes at all. They never acknowledged me or greeted me. They were not friendly. 
Next stop: the chopshop!"}
{"text":"They actually have a great concept and good menu! However, they staff is less than impressive. Drinks take  Foreverrrrr! I've been in about 5times thinking it would be better but always the same slow service. Not because of the drinks being fresh but lack of employee training and staff. The Shea location is a little better."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible. Smoothies all taste like dirt and are extremely overpriced. Go to Jamba Juice or make your own smoothie if you're obsessed with healthy juices and smoothies."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! You can ask for additional fruits/veggies and have your drink adjusted to your liking. I've been here so many times that they already know how I like my drinks made and Cimaron remembers my name because I'm always there. 

I read in some of the reviews that some of the staff can be sort of \"eh\", which I agree. I've had some great customer service experiences when the manager is there. He's very friendly and knowledgeable about the product and makes great recommendations. However, a good amount of the staff are...kids. I've walked in on several occasions and they're just chit chatting behind the counter without a care as to what the customer is looking for. I guess it all just depends on who you get. 

Overall, I'd recommend trying \"The Sublime\" or \"The Buzz\". Those juices are so bomb!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here a few days back. I had the peanut butter acai bowl and it was awesome!  I popped back by and grabbed another one a few days later. It was just as good. 

The next time I came, I had the superfood acai bowl and it was even better. That is now going to be my standard go-to when I come to visit this place."}
{"text":"My orders are always so so yummy but one time they weren't even busy and it took me 15 minutes to get my smoothie which wasn't even filled up completely. When I get a large Pink Flamingo smoothie it's like 7.50$ or something, but when I add chia seeds, my total is nearly 9$. If I'm going to pay almost 10$ for a smoothie I at least want it filled up completely."}
{"text":"Nektar website at the Hilton village Scottsdale location had a 3 day cleanse special posted ... so I drove in and went to get my cleanse on and was advised the special ended... well I googled real time the site and showed her the special and she said sorry it's already over and manager just forgot to update the site. To me you advertised it l, you should honor the price so I left an unhappy customer.


Update ... I was contact by customer service and they honored the cleanse price so picking up on Sunday to try the 3 day cleanse ... updating the review to advise they follow up was quite helpful !"}
{"text":"Nekter has a great healthy menu, however, it is a bit over priced for what it is. Also, it takes a really long time to get your order, even when they aren't busy. The place is really clean and the staff is friendly. My co-workers really love their juices, shots and berry bowls. I actually just tried their berry bowl and I was not impressed by it. But that's why everyone has their own opinions. If you want a healthier option for lunch or after a workout, then this place is a really good place to go."}
{"text":"Okay this place is great. I like this place because the workers r so funny and I love them all they r so hardworking. Also they make their own cashueow milk and that's amazing. 11/10 I wish I knew how to make cash milk because it tastes so wonderful with their smoothies."}
{"text":"Nekter juice bar honestly deserves not a single star in my opinion. Overpriced genetically modified fruits with little nutritional value. Coming from someone who has experienced the most natural and organic foods Mother Earth has provided us, I can tell you I'm not impressed. I feel as though the customers are being fooled into believing they are making a healthy choice and they capitalize on that alone. Besides that their customer service was great. the store was clean and well organized but not enough to bring me back in for another smoothie . Healthier more affordable options are out there if you know what's really good ."}
{"text":"Great place to get a juice. Glad to give them a 5 star review. Thanks for the good customer service"}
{"text":"Delicious smoothies and fast, friendly service! I love all the healthy options. This place is great!"}
{"text":"I just need to say that I LOVE their juices :) I was there today and the girl that helped me was sooo nice! That too makes all the difference :)  I'm a happy patron!!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service both visits to this new location.. flimsy cups that spilled my $8 juice all over my arm and counter when i picked it up, no acknowledgement from 3 teenagers working..super disappointed"}
{"text":"Love the bowls and smoothies here! But as far as customer service goes, it is terrible . They don't greet you and are not pleasant. I've been here multiple times at this location in Dana Park & the staff here are very rude."}
{"text":"Guess what? I love this place. Cold pressed juices, acai bowls, smoothies and protein poppers. I've been going since they opened their doors and have never been disappointed yet. I personally love The Pink Flamingo Smoothie, & PB Poppers. They are always friendly, they remember my name and the place is impeccably clean."}
{"text":"This place is my Families new favorite spot. Everything is so good and healthy for you. We spent a few hours here this weekend and plan to again this weekend!!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place...definitely my favorite juice bar! Toxin Flush with extra ginger is THE BEST!!! My kids love the Pink Flamingo smoothie too... can't wait to try the acai bowls soon :)"}
{"text":"Yikes! $9 dollars for 1/2 a banana, 1/4 cup coconut flakes and pitaya?  Rip off!  I've seen other places add strawberries, kiwi, pineapple.  I have no problem with the cost, but expect fresh fruit for that price!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Absolutely love the service! Stop by and ask for AJ, he's the best!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good, but it's nothing extraordinary and nothing you can't make yourself at home. I've been to both Scottsdale locations multiple times, ordered different things, and fair warning: don't go to either if you're in a big hurry because they are SLOOWW! They make everything fresh but should have more people or equipment to compensate for the time it takes. I've never seen more than 3 people at a time. 

They also have a punch card but don't tell you, which I find strange. It's by the register and they're happy to give it to you if you see it and ask, but don't expect them to ask you if you want one. I've only been asked if I have one once out of more than 10 trips."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"Acai Superfood\" bowl today - great blend of flavors, light and healthy breakfast option! Great quality food, always consistent."}
{"text":"What a little gem!
I don't always post the most positive of reviews but this juice bar is really as good as it gets!
I had some time to kill in the neighborhood, so I was so glad I stumbled upon this Oasis (truly an oasis), with its myriad varieties of juices, smoothies and acai bowls...
I got the peanut butter Acai bowel and it was amazing!!! It was so good and filling.  All the products are organic and great for people on clean diets.
I ordered the 16 oz drink so I decided to get the Sublime Juice, which contains lime, orange, Parsley, Kale, spinach, and cucumber.  It was really good!  Has a bit of tartness in it which I like. You can even customize your drinks as well and add on other ingredients to drinks that are already set with certain ingredients.
Friendly and fast service! This juice alone totally satisfied the craving I had been having. In fact, it hardly tasted like juice at all, more like a sweet savory dessert...
The medium size wasn't too expensive either - less than $6. I felt sad that I couldn't get ALL the juices because they sounded so good."}
{"text":"Great juice bar. Good recipes for green juices. I tried the greenie and the detox. I like the detox one the best out of the two but they both were yummy! Our order took a little bit longer than other juice bars and the ambient techno music was on the loud side so it made it irritating to listen to; that's why it's 4 stars. The decor is nice, not sure why loads of money was probably spent on fake fruits and veggies that line the juice bar but whatevs. It looks nice. I wish they were open until 9p like everything else in the plaza. I will be coming back to try the acai bowls."}
{"text":"I've been to nekter around 5 times since it opened and I am so happy with what they offer! I've not only tried a lot more items from the menu, but the staff is wonderful!

I ordered 2 24oz popeye açaí smoothies, and they looked a little more brown than usual (instead of the bright green color). the staff was super kind and offered to remake the smoothies for me! I greatly appreciated the extra effort to make sure their customers were happy."}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because of the poor customer service. Every time I have been there they are extremely efficient with getting the product out, but are not very friendly. I tipped them and did not get any Thank you, and when saying thank you to them for my smoothie, I get no reply of your welcome or have a good day. I have worked in customer service for 6 years, and I know what good quality customer service is. Wonderful product though."}
{"text":"This is the BEST juice bar I've found in Las Vegas. 

Get the \"Date Nut!\" It's amazing! 

Great friendly service and great food. 

The pre-made juices are delicious especially the lemonade with cayenne. 

This is a great place to go to when shopping or just to stop by when you're headed past the mall. 

The owners switched recently and the service has been way better since the change. 

I love this place and will continue to go almost daily!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Just like when would juice at home. It makes you feel good and gets you going for the day. I hope you love it like I do."}
{"text":"I absolutely Love this juice bar!  Service is exceptional, and the juices I've tried have been fresh and delicious.  They even ask if you want ice in your juice, which is a good option for people who don't like room temp juice. I have tried two of their green juices and intend on trying every juice on the menu. I also tried their PB Acai bowl which was like a decadent dessert.  It is open at 7:00 am so I can zip in there on my way to work in the morning before getting on the I-215. It seems like it is a little out of the way, but actually didn't take any more time than my usual juice pick up location."}
{"text":"Great customer service and great tasting drink. Like that you can get a 32 oz juice some places don't  offer that size"}
{"text":"I really like this place, the staff is friendly, and have fallen in love with it.  However, I have to voice this, if you're going to sell a detox, or a cleanse, it should be organic.  Apples, and greens carry the most amount of pesticides. Detoxes, and cleanses, should be done with organics.... I spoke with the staff, and they state that you're looking at going organic,which will be awesome."}
{"text":"Love the juices but wish they weren't so stinking expensive. Customer service is always really great and the staff is super friendly. The lemon cleanse to go is yummy with the cayenne pepper. Great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Very bland smoothie . Watery consistency. I got the chocolate dream and it tasted watered down. My husband got the banana nut and didn't like his either ."}
{"text":"Always great service here, their smoothies are awesome but I always get their juices. I love their little beet. I appreciate that they always ask if I want ice or not in the juice."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Very friendly staff. They were able to let me customize my order. Their tropical Cooler with Peanut Butter is amazing. Acai bowls are very good as well. Great place to go on a hot day! Get your micros in and stay healthy!"}
{"text":"Went in the other day and wanted something cold and healthy. I tried a bowl with a thick smoothly at the bottom with bananas, strawberries, blueberries and granola on top. This was tasty and very satisfying. I would recommend this place to everyone. great service and great products"}
{"text":"4 stars for a juice bar. Have never been disappointed by the quailty or taste. Quick service usually but could work on Customer Service interaction and appeal. Excellent example would be to check out Dutch Bros coffee shop and learn from their  service. Great service with positive interaction that's upbeat and brings you back. Cleanse product is a bit overpriced. I would also offer a certified organic option to the menu if not make all menu organic and pestacide free."}
{"text":"Warning!! I am about to sound a bit crunchy and pretentious. I juice. I have a juicer and I juice veggies. I sometimes get lazy and don't want to spend the time that it takes to do it so I was really happy to see this place open. I have been in a few times but I probably won't go back. It takes a long time to get your juice sometimes. It wasn't even busy the last time and it took forever. I also realized that the veggies were not organic. I get grossed out with the pesticide thing* (*crunchy and pretentious)  I will go out of my way to Pomegranate instead."}
{"text":"I am absolutely appalled - just discovered a PLASTIC BAG BLENDED INTO MY DRINK!!!!

I purchased a large Popeye smoothie about half an hour ago at the Chandler location. I got in my car and started drinking my smoothie as I headed back to work. I instantly noticed that there were small chunks of plastic in the first few sips. I pulled them out of my mouth and took a photo at the stop sign. I was very hungry and took a few more drinks only to find that there was plastic in each and every sip. When I finally arrived at work (hungry still) I fished into the bottle to discover that an entire plastic bag had been blended into my drink! I took and uploaded photos of the plastic with the date and time visible in the background. 

I CANNOT BELIEVE that I was DRINKING small pieces of PLASTIC let alone to discover a LARGE chunk in the bottom of the glass. I am very lucky that I did't choke on any of these pieces while driving down the I-10. This not only poses a health risk, but a safety risk as well. I cannot imagine what would have happened if a child was given this drink."}
{"text":"Let me get the one irritating thing out of the way first.  The wait to get a juice made here is ridiculous.  20 minutes to get what I purchased?  Out of control.  I'd suggest you go into this place knowing you'll be waiting for a bit, and they probably should front load peoples expectations before you order.  

Other than that, its the best product you'll find in that part of town.  Blows the doors off the juice bar at FLW and scottsdale rd."}
{"text":"This place is cute. I am not sure why other people say the girls are rude here, I didn't think so. I LOVE the tropical cooler! This is my favorite! Not sweet tasting at all like Jamba Juice. I believe the calorie content is less than Jamba Juice as well. I tried the Acai Peanut Butter Bowl. This was very good as well, but it was really big for me! :D I can never finish it! Tips for the owners: Maybe have smaller portions for us super skinny people and please try to be open earlier! I am an early bird and so are a lot of others in Scottsdale! It would be nice to grab a drink before work out or after! I will be back and I have recommended this place to my friends. I've been to the one on Scottsdale Rd as well, just as good as this one on Shea!"}
{"text":"First time in and asked what they suggest. Got a tropical cooler and it is fantastic! Great place, friendly staff. Try 'em out!"}
{"text":"We had the Banana Berry and Pitaya Bowls.   Nice presentation and tasted great.   Very refreshing."}
{"text":"I happened to stumble upon this place on a Sunday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the 16oz Buzz and it was delicious! Tasted natural and healthy, didn't taste any preservatives or frozen junk like many other juice places. I usually hate carrot juice but the combo of carrot and the other ingredients made it delicious and refreshing. I'll def return and try the other juices on the menu."}
{"text":"If you're in the Arcadia area and you're looking for your superfood fix, Nékter is the place to go. Service is great and the smoothies taste like you're having fresh fruit through a straw. Make sure to download the app for free perks."}
{"text":"I love this Nekter location! The staff is always so friendly and helpful with suggestions!"}
{"text":"I love this place for their healthy side. They use fresh ingredients and its made to order. All of their juices are really healthy and you can just taste the health benefits. I had the buzz, i definitely suggest getting the juices over ice. 
The smoothies im in love with the pink flamingo and if you like things a little more tart ask to subsititue the coconut water for orange juice. Ive had a acai bowl im not sure which one but i asked for no coconut flakes and the workers kindly asked me if i would like to sunstitute it for something else and they let me get strawberries instead. The acai bowl was great and had a lot of the granola banana strawberry and i think there was a honey drizzle topping. It was delicious and the smaller size was plentiful. I do wish that there was a location in henderson. Id be up in that joint all the time! Im only able to come over to nektar when i have work or i visit my friends on this side of town which is unfortunate."}
{"text":"So amazing! Got the best customer service by a blond girl named Caitlin. I wasn't feeling very well and so she suggested an updated version of the Sublime to help my symptoms and she was not only very informed about her work but so very sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"Lauren & Angie were awesome! I was in a rush and they got me in and out with ease! They even recommended a new drink to me so I just went and bought both to have a backup drink for later! Thanks for recommending I use the app too so that I can get in and out with my drinks even faster! 

Thanks Lauren + Angie!"}
{"text":"Nekter is a great find.  Fresh juice.  I love their cleanse products.  The blend are delicious and effective.  I really appreciate Nicky Watts.  She suggested I try the ginger shots.  What a difference it made to my well-being and allergies."}
{"text":"Employees are always super kind and accommodating. Whenever I call in they always have my items ready! Definitely a great location and the smoothies are fantastic !!"}
{"text":"Always my go to spot when out of town is to find Nektar. I love the menu and the people."}
{"text":"NICE TRY NECTAR! 
NOT ORGANIC=POISON \"NECTAR\"
Do not be mislead by this company, fronting as a healthy, nutritious juice bar. Unfortunately they made every right move except their ingredients. My first visit, I was delightfully surprised at how down to the earth the layout of the store looked. However, I was shocked to find that none of the fruits or vegetables they used were organic. I inquired further and was assured, as if it made a difference, that all ingredients went through a thorough 3 stage cleaning process. This screams CORPORATION. Non-organic fruits and veggies cannot simply be washed to remove the toxins leftover from pesticide use nor can the bio-energetic \"life\" of the plant be restored after it has essentially been raped by modern growing practices. This is not natural people. If your fruits and vegetables need a \"3 stage cleaning process\" they aren't for you. The dirt and organic compounds leftover after harvest are vital sources of minerals and nutrients straight from Mother Earth. Quite simply you have a juice bar, fronting as a provider of nutrition, juicing fresh fruits and vegetables that have been grown with pesticides. By the process of juicing, you are not only concentrating the vitamins and minerals but also all the TOXINS and byproducts of growing with pesticides and artificial nutrients. Great intentions, but I believe you have failed do either to lack of knowledge or an unwillingness to go the lengths to offer organic, quality ingredients, even at the cost. 
Not to mention when inquired about their wheatgrass, they informed me it was shipped to them. Do not support nectar. Support local organic growers and grow your own medicine. You can make anything you can buy at nectar at home for a fraction of the cost, without harming your health. Power to the people, people, not these corporations looking for money. Optimal wellness is really not expensive."}
{"text":"The smoothies are pretty good and the staff is nice as well. I like the nut milks they offer in the fridge by the counter where you order and the atmosphere is relaxing and chill.

This would be a 5 star review but I have a friend that comes here often and his acai bowls have been messed up the last few times and that bugs me. He always gets the PB bowl but somehow gets handed the Tropical. Happened to him two times in two/three weeks. What a bummer!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite healthy addiction!! Everything I've had is so delicious! I've even done the cleanse and although I didn't care for some of the juices, I followed it and can definitely see the difference it made with my sugar cravings."}
{"text":"I love everything about Nekter besides the price.  I could eat the peanut butter bowl everyday it is that good!
Most the juices that I have tried have been delicious as well.  I'm not into the cleanse routine so I can't comment on that business.
Staff is always friendly and the store is always clean!"}
{"text":"This place is tasty but super expensive. A small 16oz smoothie is $4.95 plus tax and a regular 24oz smoothie is $6.95 plus tax. 

The employees weren't very helpful either.  I asked for recommendations since it was my first time and they seemed annoyed and uninterested with me. There were two men working and after one took my money he went into the back to make my smoothie but he didn't wash his hands. 

I would go back if the prices were lower and the employees were nicer."}
{"text":"Today I'm having the superfood bowl it was just ok but my wife had the mango bowl it was great and like always great service"}
{"text":"After a couple days of hangover, Kim (my thirsty little baby) and I were craving for some wholesome cold pressed juice.  This is when we encountered Nekter. The friendly staffs from inside waved us in, and we got ourselves some fresh room temperature juice since it was freezing outside.  I substituted the cucumber with celery in my Detox juice, and it was quite alive. I loved the ginger, especially in the cold weather. It really did give me a buzz and kept me warm."}
{"text":"It's juice. Nothing special about it. Overpriced. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Have been in twice and both times have left very disappointed. The employees, especially the shift supervisor are rude and do not belong in a customer service based job."}
{"text":"Horribly disappointing! I love healthy juice/smoothie places and this one is on my way to work. I got an offer on Facebook for a half off deal and went this evening to try it out. There is no hours of operation sign posted but the door was open so I went in. It was 6:05pm on a Monday. There was no one behind the counter and I had to call out to the person in the back room. She said sorry we're closed but then another guy came over and said they could serve me. Well then I was turned away because they already cashed out the till for the evening. I left with no juice or smoothie only a sore taste in my mouth. Poor customer service for a new business in town. I'll keep going to Tropical Smoothi one mile down the road."}
{"text":"Had the peanut butter acai bowl and it was the best acai bowl I've had yet! Super cute inside too! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love this place. The fruit bowls are heavenly. I've tried all of em. smoothies are great too. I get a wheat grass shot every once in a while. Also good."}
{"text":"This location is way too slow in service. Also they skimp on the fruit in the fruit bowls!!! I took my family here to have them experience the great fruit bowls but that was a fail. The blended fruit in the bowls were melted by the time they got the orders ready. and they forgot the wheat grass shot, i had to remind & wait some more... The location near Scottsdale rd & Lincoln is way better."}
{"text":"I was planning on going to Kaleidoscope juice for my first juice cleanse, but saw the advertisement for the $39/day cleanse at Nekter during a trip to Jimmy Johns. I went in to ask some questions and I was helped by a very nice girl who said the deal ended on Saturday 2/15/14. On Friday, I saw via Facebook that the deal was extended to Sunday 2/16 and convinced my husband and a friend to do the cleanse with me on Sunday. 

Today (Saturday) I went in to purchase 2 one day cleanses. Initially, as I walk in, I see several people waiting for their drinks and food, and I am waiting at an empty register while 3 people are in the back working on orders. After about a minute, one of the girls who seems very busy and stressed says she will be right with me. No biggie, I'm not in a rush. When she gets back to the register, I order 2 one day cleanses and the stressed out girl comes off as a little rude. She says, \"well the deal ends today, so are you going to do the cleanses today?\" In my head I thought, on Facebook it says it ends Sunday, and why would I have to do the cleanse today when the juices are good for a couple days? I didn't quite get it, and I didn't think she was very friendly so I just said \"yes\". 

When I got home, I showed my husband the juices and we planned on starting the cleanse the following day. On the label of the juices, it says to consume the juice within 5 days of purchase, but as we inspect the bottles, half of the bottles have an expiration date of 5 days from today (2/20/14) and half have an expiration date of TODAY (2/15/14). Because we are concerned about getting sick from these juices, we decided to do the cleanse today even though we were not quite ready.

I give 2 stars because my first impression was not a good one, but I am willing to go back and try the smoothies because they are cheaper than other juice bars in the area. BUT I will not recommend this place to anyone unless my next experience is a good one. My suggestion to Nekter is to make sure they have enough people working on a Saturday so that the workers are not stressed and can be friendly at all times. I also suggest that they are consistent with the deals/advertisements they have on social media, and to make sure they're not giving old juices while telling people they can start the cleanse a few days after purchasing it.

_______________________________________________________________
*******UPDATE:
My husband posted on Nekter's facebook about the bottles having different expiration dates and they said \"we apologize as all bottles should expire the same day - we would be glad to give you new bottles to compliment the others. thank you!\"  SO my husband goes to exchange the expired bottles, the girl he talked to did not want to help him and said that the cleanse is supposed to be completed the day of purchase (although their website says different) and that is why the bottles expired that same day. He tells her that he was told that all of the bottles should have the same expiration date and she says \"well you must have spoken to someone in California because we do things differently in Arizona\". Really?! After going back and forth, she finally gives in.  I would have given them an extra star for fixing the problem right away, but it was such a frustrating experience, that I've decided to take one off. We will not be returning.

P.S. Tim G. I'm not complaining about a short shelf life. Read my review and do your research ;) thanks!"}
{"text":"I will not be coming back to this location. I have given multiple chances, but today just did it for me. I have experienced an unfriendly vibe the other times I have come in, however the product was always great so I've looked past the negative energy. Today not only was there an especially bad vibe, but the $9 bowl that I made a special trip to get was pretty sad (see photo). I'm not sure what's going on here and why employees seem so unhappy to be working in what should be a really great business.

The previous time I went in, I had to order a different product than usual because they were out of açaí. On top of that I ended up having an allergic reaction to this other product...which is not their fault (never knew I was allergic to mango). I probably should have just stopped coming to this location then, but even still I gave it another chance. 


I will be driving a lot further to a different location next time hopefully for a better overall experience."}

{"text":"I do thank the company for contacting me, I did explain what happened. Couple weeks later I received a check for the refund of the two drinks.

I'm sure it was just one of those mishaps that happen to happen when I visited. Every business will have them and again I appreciate this business contacting me to make it right! 

Haven't been in the area to try them out again but when I am I will certainly do so!"}
{"text":"I've been to multiple locations and this location by far has been the best ive encountered. The manager Samantha suggested the sun devil bowl and I was very pleased. She  is the definition of what a manager should be. Very kind, attentive, had the mentality of putting the customers first. If you're trying to go somewhere where you want to experience a lovely staff, management, and a chill environment, this Nekter is the place to be. If I could rate this 10 stars I would."}

I could not believe the energy I got from that Berry Banana Smoothy., that was then I realized this was going to be a part of my weekly thing. Nekters got a cool culture going with awesome  staff and awesome customers. I like the vibe there and would recommend it to anyone that's looking to improve their health and wellness. This is huge for sure.   Richard H."}
{"text":"My family and I make stops here at least once or twice a week. I've never had a bad experience with customer service at Nekter. I feel they are always very polite and helpful. My favorites are the turmeric shot, the toxin flush, the buzz, the date nut smoothie, and the tropical cooler. I always find it difficult to choose which drink I may go with that day since they have great variety. I've read many of the other reviews with people complaining of poor service (which makes me question the kind of customer you were being that day because I've never had an issue with the staff at this location) and bland flavors, you have to remember, Nekter actually does well at providing a healthy option. It's balanced well with fruit and veggies with no added sugars. If you want something terribly unhealthy and full of sugar you can go back to Jamba Juice which I find to be terribly disgusting personally since it tastes like old produce mixed with ice and sugar or you can make yours at home by solely using fruit which is also not a very healthy option. Healthy juice bars aren't going to serve you a cup of sugar. You may be so accustomed to added sugars you may not enjoy the taste of fruit and veggies without it, but if you want healthy that means no added sugars and more veggies than fruit. I love Nekter and I have yet to find a place that beats them in tastes, prices and amounts."}
{"text":"This place is expensive compared to your normal smoothie store. Everything is fresh and done in a \"healthy way\". The Berry Banana Burst with whey was relatively bland, but it's probably because they didn't load it up with sugar like other places would. Overall it's a solid place to go if you're trying to eat/ drink healthy."}
{"text":"I had the Dragonfruit (Pitaya) bowl, it was delicious, a little sweet, but very yummy. I have a severe nut allergy, so trying to find a smoothie bowl that won't send me to the E.R. is pretty difficult, but Nèktar did NOT disappoint. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm here at least three times a month I love it....acai bowls are what it's all about! They even accommodate for nut allergies....I always order the acai tropical bowl"}
{"text":"So yummy and very friendly staff! Try the Pink Flamingo smoothie!"}
{"text":"Nekter is truly heavenly! It's not only for the health conscious but anyone who just wants some quality juice. They serve almost every kind of fruit including pitaya! Their grab and go selections are also very unique. One of my favorites is the charcoal lemonade which has both a sweet tangy flavor with added detox benefits. They are quick with their orders and everything is made fresh. They also serve one of a kind açaí bowls and chia pudding!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the location more since it opened and have really gotten to know the friendly staff working there. They are always sure to greet me and it makes a nice stop on my commute to work in the morning. The smoothies and açaí bowls are amazing and make for a quick and healthy breakfast!"}
{"text":"Just what we needed for a flush! We'll be back, a bit of a wait but that's ok, Free wifi while you wait, sign up for Dwnld App before purchasing to get rewards free after 10drinks. It did take awhile to make 3 drinks but we see them making it fresh and not getting frozen fruits and putting it in the blender!"}
{"text":"So it's Sunday at 10:30 AM, the store hours posted on the door are 10 AM  to 6. We just got done with a run and figured we would go here for an acai bowl... door is locked with employees inside totally ignoring us!"}
{"text":"I love Nektar and all is has to offer, however, the service and urgency at the Indian School location is terrible. They are either under staffed or not very efficient. There are always people waiting and the staff does to not work well together. Hope they can work it out because the smoothies and juices are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly service and really yummy açaí bowls! I've been here a few times and am always pleased with my purchases and service. 

Their fake fruits and veggie decor kind of weirds me out though."}
{"text":"These workers need to clean up their floor. Papers all over the floor. The table that was broken like a month ago. Still broken. They're acai n smoothies are good but they need to maintain this place."}
{"text":"Would give it 5 stars but they raised their prices and the service can be super slow. Even still, the juices are a good value (compared to Kaleidescope, Juby True), and healthy and delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped by the other day just before closing... Pink Flamingo smoothie was pretty  tasty!  We have been here twice... Both times we enjoyed the smoothie. The location might be a little off the main street but the sun shine WARM during the winter. Great to sit outside when its sunny. We like that its also very clean... We will be back for sure... I approve this message J K KUHL. saving the planet from bad food."}
{"text":"So, I ended up responding to Nekter's request asking me to give them a second chance.  They asked me to download their app, or supply an address so they could offer me an menu item of my choice.  I opted for the app, which I strongly suggest using if you frequent Nekter as it's totally worth it, and went in on a busy Sunday afternoon for an acai bowl.  It was busier than the Thursday of my original visit, but it only took five minutes to get my bowl out -- which was delicious -- and the cashier, who was very pleasant, still apologized for my wait.  This was such a turn around from my first visit that I'm super impressed and had to update accordingly."}
{"text":"The pitaya bowl rocks my world, Melina always makes it exactly how I like and is always so kind and courteous! Definitely my favorite juice bar in town. I judge places on their pitaya and this one is on top."}
{"text":"We got the mango delight. It's neither mango nor delightful. It tasted really chalky. And had a nasty aftertaste. I believe they were waiting to grow some mangos because it sure took forever to get our smoothie. There wasn't a line.  Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! So AMAZING. The strawberry slimmer is delicious plus the pink flamingo is to die for. I am definitely addicted to this place and I am truly in love with this place. I will be visiting this place again soon!"}
{"text":"Serena, Jess,Victoria, and Sydney were all excellent at their job! I  so happy to go there"}
{"text":"Love this place ...Great... But be ready to wait around for the staff to finish their gossip session to get to your order. 15 min wait for juice is a little ridiculous, and no it wasn't during a rush....  Only few customer and I was the first of them in line with only 2 people in front of me waiting for beverages. Make sure you have plenty of time if you come here. Good thing it's my day off!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been reading a lot about juicing and its health benefits so I thought I would give this place a try. First time in it was a chill environment with a nice aroma. I ordered the pink flamingo and it was delicious. I would definitely order that again but I think I'll try another flavor soon. Great place and healthy."}
{"text":"Love this place and come here often. Fresh juices with a large variety of made that day juices or pressed right there when you order it.  Prices are reasonable for pressed juice as everywhere is expensive and this place isn't any more or less expensive than the other pressed juice shops. Haven't tried any of their bowls but pressed juices & smoothies are delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, and friendly. I love the taste of their house made cashew milk. I got the Popeyes's Acai and would get it again. Definitely give this place a try"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. I ordered the \"toxic flush\" and told them to add a little bit of pineapple to the juice. My friend ordered the same thing and when it came out my large juice contained 1/4 cup worth of \"juice\" and the rest FOAM/FROTH! Sorry, but not paying $10 for 1/4 cup worth of juice. Already waited 10 min and the lady said to wait another 5 min for a remake. FINALLY  took a sip of the new juice and basically straight lemon juice. So irritated at this point I just gave the juice back and said keep the sale. Never had a problem with this place except today. And there were only 4 customers."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Best acai bowl I have tried yet. So many toppings that each bite had a taste of its own! Would 10/10 recommend."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I have been there 4 times hoping it would get better.  It got worse.

The first time, I had an açaí bowl.  I have had hundreds of açaí bowls in my life, and I can confidently say this was the worst.  Totally flavorless.

The second time I got the Peanut Butter smoothie.  It was pretty bad, but not as bad as the açaí Bowl.  But I am trying to eat more protein, so I forced myself to finish it.

The next time, I tried the Peanut Butter smoothie again, but with a different nut butter.  Even worse.

So, yesterday, I convinced myself to give it just one more chance...  I got the Açaí smoothie and it was terrible.

If you're looking for a good smoothie or açaí bowl in NE Mesa, you're just going to have to drive..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The service great. I've been twice and I had a great experience both times. I like that they use cashew milk as the base of some of their smoothies. I've had the chocolate dream smoothie it's delicious. I would have never thought to use avocado in a chocolate smoothie. If your in the area definitely take the time to try a smoothie or juice."}
{"text":"LOVE Nekter, go almost every day. Juice, smoothies, and acai bowls are awesome."}
{"text":"A little heavy on the cashew (I'm slightly allergic so wish it was almond) and agave which is in no way shape or form a health food. Pure sugar is healthier than agave. Anyways, taste good so 3 stars."}
{"text":"What a joke.. First and only time here.  Saturday morning at 1045 my wife went in to order 4 juices while i waited outside with our 2 kids. As i watch people who went in after my wife come out with thier orders, 25 mins later my wife came out with only 3 of the 4 drinks.  Apparently if you order from thier App your drink is priority.  After i go in to get our missing drink we finally have a complete order after 35 mins.  Like i said first and only time here, will NOT be going back"}
{"text":"Went in here to try my very first acai bowl! There was no one in line (around 5pm) but a few people that seemed like they were waiting for their orders in the store. The staff was incredibly friendly when I ordered! I waited there about 10 minutes for my bowl that was delicious! I would definitely come here again, but it wish it was a bit quicker!"}
{"text":"I love coming here after a long rigorous hike.  The Açaí Power bowl is refreshing and filling.  The bowl has just the right sweetness and hits the spot every time."}
{"text":"It's a cute little juice bar and I've been quite happy with everything I've had here. They tend to be a little slow (I've only ever seen one person working in the back and one in the front). As others have said, it's a little expensive considering it's not organic but I'm not an everyday regular and I wouldn't say it's more expensive than most of the other places I go for similar things.

The PB bowl is AMAZING. Seriously, if you love peanut butter indulge in this goodness! Pitaya (dragon fruit) is another favorite...as the bowl or the smoothie. 

Just don't go when you are in a hurry and be prepared to spend a little for the fresh ingredients and you'll most likely be pleased as punch!"}
{"text":"Nekter is conveniently located for grabbing a juice or a smoothie while I'm running errands the weekend. There is a cooler of pre-made drinks you can buy or order a juice, smoothie or acai bowl.  I've had The Sublime (juice) and The Health Nut (smoothie). The Sublime is refreshing and not too sweet. The Health Nut is a great breakfast smoothie. I really enjoy both of them. 

The reason Nekter is only three stars is their speed and service. Every time I've been in there over the past few months - busy times, slow times, early morning, late afternoon - I've been very disappointed in how long it took to get my drink. The fastest time was over 5 minutes. That might not sound long, but...it's a juice. 

Drinks: 5 stars
Speed / Service: 2 stars"}
{"text":"Free WiFi. Friendly helpful staff. Really fresh vege and fruit  juices, smoothies, and even has vegan offering."}
{"text":"I love this place. Every kind that I've tried is delicious. The staff is very friendly and the place is always spotless! Try the Toxic Flush!"}
{"text":"Overall it's a great place, Fresh juices that are made on the spot, I like the fact that you can create your own juice, they are also have a selection to choose from, the pink flamingo is tasty. Some times it's take a while until ready so be prepared to spend some time there, however it is healthier and refreshing ;)"}
{"text":"As a regular Nekter customer, I am very disappointed with my visit today. I went to this location asking for the $3, 16 oz juice/smoothie 'radio' promotion when the young woman behind the counter informed me it was over. I was more than surprised as it had just been advertised on the radio (Kiss-FM) the day before and I had just purchased one yesterday, as well. When I asked if it had ended today, I was rather snottily informed it had \"ended, like, two weeks ago\". I mentioned it had just been on the radio the day before and was further informed. \"Yeah, well, I, like, asked my manager and she said it was over.\" I said thank you and left not only juiceless, but angry as well. I then proceeded to drive to the Nekter location at Tempe Marketplace where I was greeted with a smile and when I asked about the promotion, I was pleasantly informed it had been extended, though they were unsure as to when. I received no attitude for my questions.

Here are the caveats: I am a regular Nekter consumer and go several times a month. I had fully intended to buy a juice, regardless of a promotion or not. It was the attitude of disgust and dismissal that I received from this Nekter location that forced me to take my business elsewhere. The young adults at this location need a hard lesson in acceptable customer service and how to stay up on the promotions their own company is running."}
{"text":"The service and product at this location are consistently excellent. They're one of two of my favorite Nekter stores."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  I've been here about six times, and have gotten the \"Chocolate Dream\" every time. It's so good, I haven't wanted to try anything else. I wouldn't say Nekter is \"better\" than Jamba Juice, but it's a nice alternative. Nekter is a very solid choice in the (very small) world of smoothie places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"what a tasty smoothie I had the tropical green one I think I didn't have my glasses on so I couldn't read the menu but the girl read me the menu to me what 5 stars for service the drink was good but not the best I've had but I'll be coming again"}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE AÇAÍ & SMOOTHIE PLACE!!! I love Nekter Juice Bar, it's so yummy! I wish there was more of the shops all around!! It's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"I got the tropical cooler and it is honestly amazing! My friend got the toxin flush and it was fantastic as well, I highly recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"The smoothies are delicious! Try The Pink Flamingo  my husband favors their fresh juices, specially The Greenie."}
{"text":"Really good service and a very nice shop to go in and get you a healthy snack. Looks modern and what you would expect from a Juice and acai place. From the wooden chairs to the random portraits on the wall. 
After you go to a Pilates class then that's definitely the spot to go."}
{"text":"Tried the acai tropical bowl, it was perfect!
Nekter offers more than just acai bowls. I can't wait to try the smoothies and juices they have. Service was pretty fast, employees were nice and helpful, would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Love my new best friends at Nekter Juice bar. local grown veggies and making juice from scratch. And they custom built my Juice according to fitlife menu . Awsome friendly service and extended hours which really work well for me."}
{"text":"They desperately need more hands on deck here. I order ahead and STILL end up waiting an extra 20 mins past my expected pick up time. That's only because no one acknowledged me or asks me why maybe I've been standing at the pickup counter for over 20 minutes. When I finally catch someone's attention they tell me they never got my order. I'm in the service industry, I get it you get backed up and things happen . But kind, great customer service goes A LONG WAY."}
{"text":"Their smoothies and juices all sound so good but I was kind of disappointed in the one I got. I ordered the mango delight and it just wasn't much of a delight. The taste was VERY bland and it just tasted like ice. A medium cup of blended ice isn't quite what I want to spend $9 on. Maybe I will try a different drink next time."}
{"text":"My new favorite place for vegan, gluten free ice cream! The Bannana Merry Burst is another fave. And the vegan brownies. Yum! I'm here almost every day!"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot in the morning for a fresh delicious smoothie or acai bowl. I've been obsessed with pitaya and acai bowls lately and I think I found the spot. The app is super cool too, make 10 visits and your 11th one is free. So far I've tried the pink flamingo smoothie and the acai banana berry bowl. The bowl was well balanced with fresh bananas and agave nektar. Bomb! Love this place so much."}
{"text":"Thirsty for a healthy drinks and food? Stop by in this place for some good shake, juice, smoothie and yogurt bowl. They indicate how much calories per item as well. I was looking for a light lunch after workout and this is just perfect. I tried the mango bowl and it's quite filling. It has banana, coconut flakes, granola and strawberry yogurt. I was in and out and did not wait too long. It is located in the best shopping area in downtown summerlin. The vibe is lovely."}
{"text":"I always get great smoothies when I get here. The staff isn't very personable or nice but I wouldn't be happy if I worked there either"}
{"text":"Brandy is rude and never work customer service!!! She will get in your face and has no problem insulting customers.   She's scary"}
{"text":"Not impressed.
I had the Greenie the other day and it was just blah. Like super blah. 

I don't think they are organic and it seemed like this green selection was filled with mostly celery, yea the cheap stuff, as filler. 

I came home and my sister who was visiting said \"dang! smells like celery juice!\". She knows her juice, she owns a $2K juicer, can't remember the brand name, beautiful like a car.
For $8-9 for a 24oz plus a dollar tip I threw away the last 1/3 of the juice.

I will stick with Whole Foods, they really get juices right. Or of course Pressed etc. 

The customer service was not really anything, just asked me what I wanted (I didn't know so I checked out the menu) and verified what I wanted. Called out my juice when it was done, that's it. Believe me I don't need a song and dance but the place was empty and super quiet. Like eerily quiet. It was about 3pm so that's not a high traffic time but at least turn up some music or something. 

Maybe I'll try them again if I'm in the area. Meh."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Arizona! The juice is fresh, the employees are knowledgeable and very nice and the whole place is very laid back. I love it!"}
{"text":"I was here from out of town last Saturday. My family and I called in an order in which I ordered a pitaya bowl with gluten free granola... We got there and I asked which was the gluten free bowl ( as they didn't have them labeled) and they said none of them were... The cashier then went to the back where I could see him personally scoop off the granola to add the gluten free kind... I was utterly disgusted. I am severely allergic to gluten and could have gotten extremely ill if there were even a trace of it left in my bowl. I confronted the cashier after coming back out of the kitchen and asked him to make me a new bowl. This could have been a recipe for a disaster if I hadn't seen the improper food handling. Will not return to Nekter after experiencing this."}
{"text":"I can't think of anything to say that's bad about this place. 
Either I have great timing and never wait behind more than 3 people or they just aren't that busy. The smoothie selection is amazing ive tried them ALL not joking! There isn't one I didn't like which makes it super hard when I go in to pick one. The acai bowls are amazing. 
Tip grab a nekter reusable cup them give you a lil extra amount in the cup when you order the medium size!"}
{"text":"LOVE NEKTER!!!!!  Amazing customer  service, great delicious drinks, bowls, and cleanses...I can't complain about a single thing except I wish their was one in the GLENDALE, AZ area."}
{"text":"The juice is always good and I've been there many times. The reason I give three stars is because the employee was crass and was not happy to be there this morning. Also when I extended my cash to give her she told me with an attitude that she couldn't change my cash because they ran out. It's Village Center Circle and you don't run out of cash from the weekend. Also I don't care about your personal problems in your life, when you greet customers you need to be happy and go on like everything is good. She also because of her attitude forgot lemon in my juice. To sum up my review if employees were happier or at least acted happier in front of customers everything else would go smoothly because you already have a great product."}
{"text":"I had a couple sips of bottled juice that tasted kind of sour and now have the worst food poisoning ever!!!! Fever, chill, vomiting, and diarrhea . I haven't felt this bad in years!"}
{"text":"I genuinely used to really like this place. The staff used to be really friendly, and all of my orders were on time and tasted amazing. Two girls I always noticed there were always so sweet to me, made me laugh and feel comfortable. They made my orders PERFECTLY and I would always appreciate walking in to see either one of them working. Their names were (I believe) Milcah and Melina. But more recently, I haven't seen them at all! I was a little bummed that they weren't there to talk with and make my order perfectly, but I figured they just had the days off. But since recently, my orders have been HORRIBLE. None of my orders are ever on time, and they're never made exactly how they made them. Huge bummer that these girls haven't been there. Don't plan on coming back to this business."}
{"text":"I'd come back to Phoenix for this place! My friend and I went hiking on camelback mountain and to treat ourselves for making it to the top we decided to grab some smoothies. Looking for healthy and yummy options, along came nekter. 

Not only is everything fresh but delicious as well. I drank their toxic flush juice on our first visit and it was the weirdest mixed concoction that worked great together! Ginger and apples compliment another great apparently. My Taste buds enjoyed every sip and begged for another one. 

We decided to make this our treat yourself splurge and came back the next day after our second hike. I ordered the Pink Flamingo and it was blended to perfection.

I wish they were in Chicago because I would totes become a loyalty member in an instant."}
{"text":"To keep it simple:

Pros: great location, diverse menu options and flexible substitutions, fun atmosphere. I would give the menu and food 5 stars. I love the Acai peanut butter bowl and they have quick and easy snack options too. 

Cons: it is understandably very noisy inside so it's hard to eat inside if you need to have a conversation or phone call and there is no outside seating. (Recently got one table). Additionally, the bowls take a very long time to make. Also understandable due to the process but hard if you are in a rush. Lastly, the staff is not overly friendly in any way."}
{"text":"My first visit was great! The ladies were awesome! The juice is so yummy and refreshing!"}
{"text":"The 2 stars are for how clean & trendy the place is that's it. Tonight i ordered two smoothies for my husband & I and they were awful we had to throw them out. No kind of flavor at all, they were sour & expensive. Also the produce is NOT organic. I was bummed. I initially wanted to get the toxic flush green juice but after finding out the produce wasn't organic I changed my mind bc it defeats the purpose of a \"toxic flush\" when the produce is mostly likely spray with toxic pesticides & all kinds of chemicals."}
{"text":"Their place is always clean! You get the swift scent of healthiness as soon as you walk in. Their acai bowls are great. I'm not so big on the juices (I cant be THAT healthy), but their smoothies are my jam. Always a great substitute to a lunch when you don't have time/are dieting."}
{"text":"Kaitlyn is amazing! I'm at this location multiple times a month. This trip I had about 8 orders 4 that I called ahead kaitlyn was so patient and amazing making recommendations! They are my fave location!"}
{"text":"The Acaì strawberry banana bowl gives me a LIFE. I'm serious, it's so damn good. Do yourself a favor and give it a try."}
{"text":"Amazingly healthy and delicious smoothies and juices.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love the juice, but the service is absolutely terrible. Everyone in there seems half awake and when I went in yesterday for one smoothie and one bowl, I waited for almost twenty minutes. I understand that it is all made fresh but the girl making it was moving at a glacial pace. She would put one thing in the blender and then stand there for a few seconds, then slowly open the fridge and cut one piece of fruit at a time. I love the drinks, but I don't have that much time when I am running over from work. I wish there was a way to speed up service. Maybe having more than one person in the back making drinks would help ? Not sure but by the time I had left there were now five people waiting behind me."}
{"text":"Work across the street from this place. Was greeted by the staff when I was peering through the window. Super courteous staff. Asked a few questions and they were more than fine answering and chopping it up about the shop. 

I dig the layout of the shop as well. It's clean and good looking. 

Went back today and ordered a berry banana burst smoothie. Amazing. My girlfriend ordered The Buzz juice and it was the most vibrant natural juice ive ever seen. Definitely will be back to this place."}
{"text":"Great place for freshly made juices and bowls. Everything is made fresh to order which takes a little time to make. The staff is very kind as well. The only thing about this place is the cost is quite high for a healthy juice."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The juice is amazing and the customer service is too! I've tried the smoothies and my kids love those but I'm partial to the juices. The bowls are delicious too! Use the mobile app to order for lightning fast service. The app was recently updated and is easy to navigate and use."}
{"text":"This is my favorite juice bar in Las Vegas. Definitely the best acai bowls around and must try bottled mixers! 

The staff was very friendly and informative about all their products and the shop itself was very clean and organized."}
{"text":"I got the green detox it was okay the acidity burnt my tongue and throat. And the employees need more communication. It was really awkward when the guy took my order because there was another employee trying to fight with him. I'll try something different, but the vibes in here are off."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed several different smoothies and juices from here - super delicious, pretty affordable, great rewards program, and definitely a favorite valley location!"}
{"text":"After coming here a few times & trying a few of the smoothie & bowl options, I have to say that for the amount of money you spend, it's not worth it.

The things I didn't like - I've had the Banana Berry Burst which was completely tasteless ... I can make a better strawberry banana smoothie at home. Also, the Pink Flamingo which is supposedly the best seller in the store ... I thought it tasted really weird, my guess is because of the coconut water (but it was really bright & fun to look at if that matters to you).

The two stars on their whole menu are the Date Nut smoothie & the PB bowl. Definitely stick to those if you go. Even then, I'd recommend to only go once in a while because the money you spend on these items is going to be an obscene amount. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. I can't get enough of this place. Everything is incredibly fresh, the store is always clean, and their employees are very friendly. This is my go-to stop after a workout. The Toxin Flush and Green Apple Detox are my favorites. I have yet to try an acai bowl but they look delicious. Prices are on point - about $7.

I only wish they were open past 6 and that there was one around the corner from my house..."}
{"text":"love this place! My favorite is Toxin Flush. My husband always gets the Health Nut. And my picky 14 year old son, get the Berry Blast with peanut butter. Eveyone super nice and knowledgeable. Sometimes you can a grab a juice for 40% off in the grab and go case. ( juices are almost expired)"}
{"text":"This place is outstanding- best acai bowls I've had. smoothies are delicious as well!! Laurance, Cameron, and Ann rock- great service"}
{"text":"Updated: Ava, thank you for your response and consideration. I wish your employee had made the suggestion to try ginger instead of making me feel uncomfortable and alienated. Nekter has good product, it just wasn't represented well on that occasion.


My green smoothie was good, I did enjoy it. However, I did not enjoy being judged by the cashier when I asked if they had any caffeine add-ins like matcha, who replied that no, \"we only have natural ingredients here.\" Um....what? I'm sorry, was caffeine recently classified as \"unnatural?\" I had no idea that coffee and chocolate and tea and were artificially injected with caffeine! Yes, I was annoyed and yes, I probably need to chill out about it, but I am fed up with ignorance in general so I apologize that this comment just got to me. Anyway, it didn't feel good to feel like I was being judged for asking for an \"unnatural\" add-in and then I felt uncomfortable while I waited for my smoothie. My smoothie was yummy and I'm sure their other products are great. But my experience was not great."}
{"text":"So happy I finally got myself to Nekter. 

On Monday, I carpooled to yoga up at Gainey and on our way back home we stopped in for some bowls to go. I had the PB bowl - PERFECT for the chocolate lover. 

On Tuesday, I drove my niece and nephew to school with my brother. After drop off, he wanted a bagel which was when I suggested Nekter take 2.

This time, I got the cleansing juice (can't remember the name) but it was great minus the parsley. I definitely became accustom to the flavor but I think I would sub it out if ordered that again. My brother got the same juice along with the berry acai bowl which he devoured. 

Now, its Wednesday (7:27 am) and Nekter is on my mind again! Just found out they do $3 juices for babies. I heard the flamingo is good. 

So, clearly I am hooked and hope others hop on the band wagon too!

The prices are the most reasonable for healthy fresh breakfast bowls, smoothies, & juices in town FOR SURE.

For the first time in four years, I finally have somewhere to be in Hilton Village. I guess I wouldn't mind driving my brothers kids to school more often if it means being close by to Nekter. But wait, I also heard they may be opening a new location on 44th & Indian School :) 

That's my scoop. Go check it out. I love the atmosphere, vibe, ambiance, decor & they do juice cleanses as well!"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple bowls, they gave them to us in cups with a small amount of fruit and granola. They said it was because they were out of bowls, ok fair enough. Then as we ate our \"cups\" a lady came in and ordered a bowl and was given hers in an actual bowl????"}
{"text":"The green juices and detox blends are wonderful! Great menu, service and location!my kids like the bowls- neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"New location opened in TMP! Totally awesome! Pretty small but it's usually not too busy when we go there. 

Love the tropical cooler....I tried the Toxin flush last time...but it was too tangy for me.

It is pretty pricey...but I guess it is healthy and fresh.. I honestly wouldn't go here every day...but once in a while would be good if I'm feeling healthy and want something refreshing :)

Service is great too! They are super nice."}
{"text":"Great juice bar. Way, way, way better tasting than some others I have tried. Hard to drink them slowly. And, made me feel great all day! I am going back tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"I love nekter but this one specifically is the slowest one I've ever been to. I timed it today to see how long it would take to get my Acai Bowl and it took just about 20 minutes. Only reason I timed it is because this wasn't the first time it took this long. Nice workers and all, just a little on the slow side ¯\_(?)_/¯"}
{"text":"Nektar has great Acai bowls. Try their ginger shots for a serious kick. Staff is nice and helpful. We needed this in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"just opened. Great fresh juices plus their smoothies are awesome."}
{"text":"We love Nekter and frequent buy their delicious drinks and juices. This location is struggling though. The staff seem to not have enough support. There is a minimum of 30 minutes wait every time we come to this location. In fact, as I write this, I paid for my juice at 3:19 pm, it is now 3:45 and still nothing. I feel bad for the staff as they are getting grilling looks from the several people waiting for their orders. Will not come back to this location."}
{"text":"I give this place 4 stars because it is definitely on the pricey side! My smoothie was over $5! Beats getting Starbucks though. The lovely lady at the register was so helpful, kind, and very patient! She answered my questions promptly and gave great suggestions. I was very pleased with the pitaya bowl and the avocado smoothie! We will definitely go back for the acai bowl!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to get breakfast or brunch have a great acai bowl and good ginger shoots
Stuff is nice and friendly and price is good, the style is very welcoming and inviting and i defently recommend to check them out
Enjoy."}
{"text":"What happened to your bowls?
I just picked up a to-go order and was very disappointed to find less that 1 whole strawberry, a quarter of a banana, 8 mushy blueberries and granola that a disappointingly thin layer of granola. I have grown accustomed to a much heartier bowl from Nekter. I appreciate that fresh fruit isn't in peak season at the moment but the product is definitely suffering!"}
{"text":"Price is questionable for certain items (ex. a tiny tiiny vegan brownie), but I do really like their superfood smoothies here. 

The first one I tried was Health Nut which was about $7 or the 16oz. Well worth the cost (especially for superfoods). Really liked the cacao bits in it too. I've heard people say their drinks weren't creamy enough, but I think they need to take into account the ingredients the drinks are made out of (like cashew milk is much lighter than regular dairy milk). So it won't have a heavy/creamy feel or taste to it as other smoothies would.

Overall, something new and healthy that's worth trying out. Will be back to try their açaí bowls!"}
{"text":"I love the juices. Wish they were organic!  I've been unimpressed with the customer service. They don't smile. They just kinda stare at you like a deer in headlights. So after at least 4 trips in, I realize there is a \"loyalty program\".  Take a seat after you order. This ain't \"fast food\".   I'll try other locations to see if it's just a bit snooty over here."}
{"text":"I am giving Nektar 2 stars only because I do enjoy their berry bowls. I recently did the 1 day classic cleanse though which was a different experience entirely. I do have a very nice juicer at home - just thought the Nektar cleanse would be more convenient. The green juices included were disgusting. I choked down two of them, but just couldn't finish the third. They taste like I imagine the slime would taste at the bottom of a vase of flowers that has gone bad. In my opinion, this is because the juices are not as fresh as they should be. Fresh pressed juice should be consumed within 48 hours. These are quite a lot older than that. 

I picked up my pre-ordered bag of juice on 3-26. The bag designated for me had a tag on it that said it expired the next day. I saw a bag in the fridge with a tag that said it expired on 3-31. I asked if I could have that one thinking it would be fresher. I was told it really didn't matter since all the bottles were shipped to that location anyway. When I got the 3-31 bag home it also had bottles that expired 3-27! So anyway, kind of proves the point that if you are picking up a bag on 3-26 where some of the bottles in it expire 3-31 they are in the habit of keeping this juice around way more than 48 hours. Also they don't care much about when things expire apparently.

I had been under the impression the juice cleanse was made on site. It is not. Without even thinking about it I assumed organic ingredients would be used. Not the case. I think there is quite a bit of form over substance going on with Nektar.

Just make your own juices at home from fresh, organic, locally sourced ingredients if you can get them. A little more trouble but well worth the effort."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a clean, cool, healthy place in the area, then Nekter is the place to go.  The customer service was lacking, but other then that, I would have given this place a five star.  I'm just glad they have a store near me.  I would come back for my Pitaya Bowl and Pink Flamingo Smoothie. They always make it just right."}
{"text":"LOVE this location!! Domonique is so sweet every morning and always has a smile on her face. The smoothies and bowls are awesome!!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:
Such a bummer. I loved this place. Ordered a juice and ginger shot.  My normally light yellow ginger shot was bright green.  When i asked why, the woman who made it rolled her eyes and said don't worry about it. What? Why is it green? She said it's the same. Um, then why is it green? When i asked her to make a new one, that was light yellow, like every ginger shot I've ever had she angrily threw the shot in the garbage and started slamming equipment around while glaring at me. I asked for her name and the managers card and another employee sheepishly replied that her name is Priscilla and she is the manager.  I will be driving the extra 20mins to Grabba Green from now on."}
{"text":"I move come to this location several times I like having business meetings here lol. 

The staff is always nice and friendly. I normally get the banana berry burst (creature of habit). This visit I got the acai banana bowl. I wish they had different sizes because I could not finish mine."}
{"text":"The drink is good, but the service was meh. The girl that took my order look like she was sucking on too many lemons she needed to turn that frown upside down"}
{"text":"Great fresh juices of your looking to kick start your cleanse or take a massive do0-do0"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a Mango bowl based of a friends suggestion. It came with chopped bananas, granola, and coconut on top. I was surprised by the size. Perfect amount of sweet."}
{"text":"Everything here is good!  It's clean and modern.   It can run a bit slow in the mornings or right when school gets out.  I have yet to find my \"go-to\" order.   I am still trying everything and enjoying it!"}
{"text":"Great juice it gave me great power and made me feel great! The place was packed and looked like business is popping"}
{"text":"First timer! Expensive smoothie, my 16oz was about $6. At the time they were out of charcoal vanilla ice cream, which was heavily advertised throughout the interior. There were juice, acai bowl and smoothie options available too. The inside smells heavily of \"health,\" ginger, vegetables, the whole shabang. The people behind the register were extremely spacey and maybe a little high hahaha. It was a fine experience but for the price I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome juice bar. Great staff-Carl made perfect suggestions for us. Quick service.  We love this local place!"}
{"text":"This is conveniently located right outside Macy's. The staff is super friendly and eager to answer any questions about the menu items. All their food is fresh, and they have lots of options. Their restaurant is small ... two small tables and six bar stools. All items on the menu are under $10. Definitely will be stopping by again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's happened to this place over the last year, but the quality of ingredients has definitely declined; enough so that I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Everyone was super helpful and made some great recommendations for a first-timer to try out.  The PB bowl was quite tasty and will be going back to try out their smoothies."}
{"text":"Went there about a week ago. I loved the clean minimalist interior. As soon as you walk in you smell fresh vegetables and fruit. 
The staff was nice. 
It is worth the price you pay for it. Will be returning"}
{"text":"FINALLY. 

Juice is juice, so I am not sure how to rate their ability to get juice from a carrot or a kale leaf, BUT I can rate their ability to create an acai bowl. 

I have been on the hunt for the perfect acai bowl in Las Vegas since I encountered this delicious treat in Laguna and I have found it here!

They make the best acai bowl in town and I have tried plenty of them. 

If you like blended fruit with a \"sorbet like\" texture (most spots in Vegas make it too much like a smoothie) topped with granola and berries, then you have found your nirvana here."}
{"text":"The staff here is always so warm and friendly. The drink and bowl choices are vast and hard to pick just one of my faves. The manager, a wonderful gal by the name of Spencer, (cute, right?) runs a tight ship but is always super accommodating. I wish I lived closer to this location, but I'd probably spend way too much time there!  Go, enjoy, you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Love this place so much! Jesus started 4 months ago but he is awesome and makes an excellent smoothie bowls! He put in the extra effort to make the bowl look extra good with the fruit on top!"}
{"text":"I went into nekter for the first time in a while. It was about 6:55. The gal at the register was pleasant, but the gal in the back, after me placing my order, was heard slamming doors, etc. I felt very uncomfortable in the store. I am not sure why the slamming doors, but they were loud, like angry. Hmmm, you close at 7:00, right?"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the \"featured\" greens drink- someone must have mixed up the ratios of cucumber and celery, because there's no reason for what I drank to be so overwhelmingly bitter. Not sure if the specific person who helped me is to blame or if their drink ingredients are simply a rough guideline to follow. I make green juices regularly at home, but clearly no attempt was made at balancing the flavors in this drink.

In addition to fresh juices, menu also includes smoothies and a host of acai bowls- trying the peanut butter version is next on my list. Didn't notice until after I ordered at the counter that they have bottled cold-press juices (which I prefer) in the refrigerated case: I'll stick to those next time.

Location is by the Macy's entrance, you'll know you're near if you see the Bath and Body Works or Brighton stores."}
{"text":"They were out of the pineapple which they needed for their featured new pineapple mint drink advertised on their door.

This was early in the day too (before noon) and I even offered to help them buy more pineapple from the whole foods nearby but the manager was completely closed off to any chance of mutual help!"}
{"text":"I have always loved this place been coming here for years sometimes three to four times a week. Sometimes there's a wait but I have never minded cause I have always loved everything so much. However, I came in two days ago bought three things like I often do and one of the drinks I got just tasted off.  Like something was wrong with it. I had bought a smoothie, a green drink and some PB protein balls. So I came back the next day with my drink because it was in one of premade drinks and I had only taken one sip out of it. Everyone told me I should take it back and for sure they would give me a new one. But when I returned I told the register clerk and she just looked at me and said there was nothing she could do because I had taken a sip out of it. Uhhh.... how was I to know it was bad if I didn't take a sip of it? I am not normally someone to return a drink but I'm pregnant and I have to be careful with what I consume and I was super upset that it was so bad I couldn't even drink it. I normally love this place, so sad :("}
{"text":"I was so excited for the opening of Nekter at this location close to home.  I also went opening week and witnessed the owners/managers occupying two of the three tables in the establishment and almost the whole bench with computers and papers... What a mess!  All while paying customers stood waiting for their order next to the same bench.  Quite pricey compared to other Acai places, and who closes so early--especially on Friday and Saturday night?   I guess I'll just have to continue to drive to Gilbert for better taste, price, and customer service. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Polite staff. Juice revived in timely manner! Great atmosphere! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Pink Flamingo is my favorite drink here! Long wait to get your drink. 10-15 minute waits all the time and I don't know why. I come here on my lunch break and there's nobody in there at the time but the wait to get your drink is always so long."}
{"text":"Pitaya fruit bowl, and the Pink Flamingo smoothie are AMAIZING! I frequent this place about twice a week and took my niece there yesterday for the first time instead of her Jamba Juice and now she prefers Nekter. Their prices are a little high, however, give them a chance because it's well worth it. For a large juice to drink, or bowl is about the same price of a value meal at McDonald's. I'll let you decide which one is better for you. LOL!"}
{"text":"I visited Nektar last week for a juice and my free ginger shot (thanks to their app!), and was pleasantly surprised by this location. It's a little small and doesn't have a ton of seating, but it's cute, quaint and in a convenient location. I noticed that they have their new dairy-free/vegan \"skoops,\" made from cashew milk, which look AMAZING. 

After further investigation, I realized they use 3 types of sweetener in the skoops (ew....) Personally, I don't think there's a need for cane sugar, honey AND agave.. really? BUT... I'll give them credit where credit is due - It's vegan and gluten-free, so that makes me super happy. It's a fun take on Pressed Juicery's new \"freezes\" that I've been lusting over from afar. 

Besides that, my juice was great and I'll definitely come back. They're a little pricey, but that's what you expect for fresh juice. I recommend my favorite, less sweet combo: kale, spinach, cucumber, celery, lemon, ginger and carrot. YES!"}
{"text":"Honestly I thought the smoothies tasted bland. I ordered the pumpkin pie smoothie. To describe it is like putting a straw inside a can of plain pumpkin. Not very satisfying. As for the other smoothies, bland as well. The acaí bowls were better tasting. But overall everything was really missing flavor!!"}
{"text":"What a difference a few days make!! After speaking with Carly, the district manager about my experience, the ship has Definitely been righted. Everyone is extremely courteous, enthusiastic, and the product is terrific! They also have the card situation figured out. It is our regular go to spot for a healthy drink!"}
{"text":"Getting my \"Buzz\" going this morning. My 3rd time visiting the Trails Village location and my 2nd time having \"The Buzz\". Very refreshing. The carrots and oranges give it just enough sweetness, not too much. While the ginger gives it a little kick. Just what I need to start my mornings. A little on the pricey side, $6.25 for a 16oz. The employees are always quick and very friendly. I love that you're able to order and pay with their app online cause I'm always rushing to work and this helps."}
{"text":"Walked in on Monday at 5pm and the employee at the register just stared at me as I walked towards the register. No hello, nothing... awkward. I glance at the menu since it was my first time and the flamingo smoothie catches my eye. I walk towards him and I greet him first since he's just looking at me. 

I place my order and sit down feeling awkward AF and wait for my drink.. there are a few other customers before me waiting for their drinks as well. I get my drink like 10 minutes later and walk out of this place... feeling weird AF... 

I'd much rather go to Tropical smoothie and then have to deal with employees who aren't friendly and make you feel awkward..  oh and the smoothie? The smoothie was ok."}
{"text":"I love that you can order online and also that they have the loyalty program on the app. 

I visit often and find that I like their juices the best out of most places in the valley and enjoy that there are enough locations that I can pop in and out all around town. Their prices are also reasonable, as far as juices go, one of the best in the valley. If you're not used to paying $9 for a 24oz drink, you might be shocked, but it's inexpensive for juice."}
{"text":"Nectar is amazing. My favorite is the pitaya bowl with any of the fresh squeezed juices. If your looking for healthy and delicious look no further than Nectar."}
{"text":"First visit here and really like the atmosphere and the set up. The menu options are good.  My only thing is that I really wish they were organic. I asked why they aren't and they said to keep prices down. It doesn't make sense to me at the prices they are charging. They should be able to use local and organic and still make a profit. I would even pay a little more for organic options. I was prepared to do the week cleanse too! Unfortunately I will not be returning here, not until the have non GMO, organic fruits and veggies. If they used local that would be a bonus! The entire reason of eating while fruits and veggies is to eliminate all the toxins!"}
{"text":"OMG the açai bowls are the absolute best! The juices have a wide variety for different needs, and the smoothies look really tastey! Keep it up Nektar!"}
{"text":"All of their green juices are delicious and revitalizing!  Just has the super food acai bowl and it was divine. Always fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I come in here between 7 and 730am a few times a week and always get treated with super friendly efficient service. 

But last Thursday I came in at 655 pm (five minutes before closing!) after spin and ordered my usual drink. I knew I was coming in at the last second and it was rude, the tall cashier knew it was the last minute and it was rude. But I still got asked how my day was and told to drive home safe. 

Holy crap guys this is my favorite location for that very reason. Employees here make the juice gods proud."}
{"text":"I was in yesterday and ordered a bowl and asked for strawberries one top. was told it was an uncharged (not a big deal) but when I got my bowl I left and when I looked at it in the car I only got one strawberry for a dollar! I was charged a dollar for one strawberry, I'm sorry but that's unacceptable in my opinion.. if you are going to charge me a dollar for extra fruit it better be more then one strawberry.. needless to say I will not be asking for \"extra fruit\" again on my bowl because it's not worth it.. very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had to write a review for this place, heed my warning if you're planning on being a frequent customer. I really wanted to love this place since it opened, but I don't know what is going on with the staff of this location.

Have been to this location a handful of times periodically sense it opened, As you can tell by the pattern in the recent ratings, its a sinking ship. What happened to the great customer service I had when i first visited back in Fall? I haven't seen some of the employees that used to be there anymore and have seen some new faces, so I guess the customer service went along with those who left. Isn't good customer service a given when training the new employees? guess not.Customer service got lazier and the speed of service got slower, not to mention the product is hit or miss, depending on who's working. Watery juices, bowls, and even smoothies. What is the reasoning behind thinking its okay to send out something almost consistency of a juice, when its supposed to be a smoothie.

I will not be returning to this location not because of the infamous wait times, I do not mind waiting even if it takes 30+ minutes, because its most likely cause I came in during a rush or simply because its made fresh, so I know not to go to Nekter if I have to make a deadline. My main pet peeve is that my order should taste the same or at least very similar every time I visit,  no matter whos working, its called consistency. My tip to those who are still willing to put up them, is to look at who's working and make note if they've provided you with a quality product in the past cause that means they actually know what they're doing and not just cramming in celery or ice to fill up the cup. If you see some new faces, I wouldn't suggest making a large order, unless you're willing to gamble."}
{"text":"I loved the first one in the plaza but this one...eh. I got my usual, The Greenie and this place didn't come close. The Greenie was...watery! Tasted like watery green parsley. The prepackaged snack I grabbed was the only saving grace."}
{"text":"I've been going to Nektar for years since it's also in California, but this location happens to be the closest one for me. I can't wait for the one coming up in Desert Ridge, since I'm in west valley! Or it'd be great if they opened one up in west valley, off the 101!

My favorite acai bowl is the peanut butter bowl, but it's even better if you replace it with almond butter! The almond butter is an extra $1. I almost took a star off because it looked like it was lacking in strawberries, but individually, everything tasted amazing (and is huge! I shared with my cousin). The blend (acai/almond milk/etc) and granola were great, especially with the refreshing & fresh banana/strawberry on top.

Pro-tip: order ahead (call in or order with the app) if you're low on time! The app also has a deal where when you buy 10, you get something free. There's also some deals (like $2 off an acai bowl, or $3 for a 16oz drink) that you get through the app!

Favorite drink: toxin flush, sublime is a good similar drink if you want something more refreshing/sour. Both of these are green juices. I tried the seasonal pumpkin spice, it was a great one to try but not one I'd order repeatedly."}
{"text":"The weekend staff and teenagers that work there...... make this the weakest link of nektar locations nearby. This is the closest location to me, but after being burned 4-5 times, I actually drive further out to go to a different location. 

I've consistently had great drinks at other locations but for some reason it didn't turn out the same here. 

Not giving them one star because the location is well kept and the staff is nice enough. Smoothies are not terrible, I just wish they were consistent."}
{"text":"Started my day a little later than I normally would so I decided to call ahead an order. 5 calls later, not one single answer. At 11:30am, unacceptable."}
{"text":"Small spot for juice, smoothies, and acai bowls in downtown summerlin. Seating is limited, so plan to dine outside, take your order to go, or hope for an open seat by the window bar.
Acai bowls are decent..but their flavor combinations leave me wanting more. Portions are smaller than expected (based off of price paid), but if you must have bowl while you shop the mall..this will do.
On multiple occasions, I've noticed that the wait for my order has gotten longer. Perhaps a lack of equipment or employees to meet demand is to blame. 
During my last visit, I decided not to order after the cashier told my it would be about 15 minutes for my order to be ready (a family of 4 had placed their order right before me)"}
{"text":"Love this juice bar. They have the best acai bowls in Vegas seriously, I've tried so many none compare to this. Their acai doesn't have a bitter weird taste. Also love their berry banana burst. Seriously nothing taste bad here, great location, friendly and fast service. Love love love"}
{"text":"The juices are good and the acai bowls are great but the service is always SO slow. Seems like they're not appropriately staffed. We stopped by on a warm, Sunday afternoon and there were only two employees working. Took forever - more than 15 mins - to get a single acai bowl. The two poor guys that were working were rushing but they just couldn't keep up. They need more help."}
{"text":"Excellent juice and fresh treats at a great price. I normally grab a pb bowl (acai, banana, strawberries, dates, cashew milk) and some sort of juice. Healthy and nomtastic!! The shop itself is clean, quaint, and small. The staff is friendly and fast. Very good neighborhood vibe. They also sell juice for a juice cleanse if you need it!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this location, the staff is always super polite every time you walk through the door... they're always willing to help you select a menu item. & they even helped us with downloading the app this visit. I wish the app would allow you to get a free drink for every 10 drinks you buy because when I come with my family we purchase 2-6 drinks at a time... but the app is per visit... not per drink...so it's doesn't really seem like a deal. I also which this location did in store bottling... for drinks like the seasonal watermelon... we always want to purchase and take them home but it doesn't seem like the best idea in a plastic cup with a lid. Over all this juice bar is really clean the staff is great and the fresh pressed juice is even better. We also love the turmeric and ginger shots.. there amazing !! A must try!"}
{"text":"I love nekter. I like there is a place to get fresh juices, smoothies, and bowls. It's cute inside. The staff is friendly. The acai bowl is very good. You also have the ability to customize what you want. The pink flamingo and green smoothie are both really good too. Can't go wrong. Love."}
{"text":"Ordered the Almond Butter Smoothie \"Health Nut\" and it came out so-so.  I honestly wasn't impressed.  I took it to the counter and asked the girl, Katie, working if it would be possible to re-blend the drink for me as it was pretty bland and had a lot of chunks of ice.  She insisted on making a new one for me and it turned out great!  I would highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Super cool place, vibrant on the inside with seating. We have a similar place with this concept in MI (Jamba juice). I tried the The Sublime (I personally loved the taste of apple and parsley in this one) and The Buzz and both were very good and fresh. The menu likes to claim things like \"will give you instant buzz of energy\" or \"flushes your liver and kidneys!\" But let's be real, they are just really tasty fresh juices lol. Nonetheless, I'll be back for another refreshing taste!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with anything here! They have the best acai bowl and the their superfood acai bowl is packed full of so many healthy toppings! The prices can be very high but this is the same with many juice and smoothie places. 

I know i'm getting the best and healthiest ingredients here and the staff is always friendly. I'm a loyal customer and would suggest this place to anyone looking to improve their diet or for a healthy snack! Not to mention if you want a sweet tray their skoops are just as good as ice cream with seasonal flavors! 

Also check out their app, buy ten drinks get 1 free which is a nice reward for all the money you will have just spent!"}
{"text":"Awesome juices and smoothies! Try the chocolate dream if you are craving something rich in flavor. :D 

Employees don't seem too knowledgeable of the cleanses but my boyfriend and I tried it anyway. Six juices in a day - wasn't all that bad. We definitely felt better the following days and are now considering doing a 2-3 day cleanse."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait because you know they are actually juicing the vegetables not using some premix whatever could be in their base like Jamba Juice. Don't advise going in there right before closing as I did by accident and they had the machines already broken down. Also wish there frequent flyer program offered a free any size instead of just 16 oz. All in all its the only actual juice bar and worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Very good. 
I normally don't drink juice, but this stuff is great.
Yes, the wait can be a hassle at time,
but it is worth it.
Get the Toxic Flush.
It's sweet but not overwhelming sweet.
Good prices too."}
{"text":"So friendly !!  They were very quick and the suggestion they gave me was perfect, I love the orange crush!  Definitely recommend coming here and getting your cup of fresh and healthy!!!"}
{"text":"Since i've only had their ACAI bowl i can only review that.  Service was okay - nothing to brag about.  So yeah, I've had better tasting ACAI bowls.  I wish they would put more varieties of fruit on top instead of being blended in.  EX: Mango Bowl, This would have tasted MUCH better if it had mangos and pineapple on top instead of being blended in.  Trust me - I've had them in Hawaii and are way tastier!  But since i'm in the middle of the desert I shouldn't complain too much. But hey, its Yelp, and this is where i can air my Acai bowl issues - I guess I just miss Hawaii haha!   I'm sure everyhitng else is good on the menu but for the Mango Acai bowl - I wish I didn't order it.  :)"}
{"text":"My first time here and I would definitely come back. I got the toxin flush juice and it was tasty. Quick and easy. Sometimes it's hard to find healthy when I'm on the go, but this was perfect. I just wish it was closet to my house!"}
{"text":"I wish they had half stars. To clarify, my rating is 3.5 stars. 

I'm hooked on Nektar! I usually visit the one near my gym but I just found this location, which is only a few miles from my office. I can testify for the quality of their food/drinks - absolutely delicious. 

I'm docking stars not for the food but the service. I couldn't locate this Nektar (the shopping center it was in is huge) and when I called, someone kept picking the phone up and then hanging it up. Super frustrating. When I found it I ordered a pink flamingo, but they were out of a number of produce (not their fault, produce guy messed up the order) so I ordered the date nut smoothie. When I got my drink she only filled it about 3/4 full. I didn't want to sound like a cheap ass so I didn't say anything but Nektar isn't cheap (as most healthy options aren't), so I expect to get my money's worth. I paid for 16 oz, not 12 oz..."}
{"text":"Great juices and all but total waste of time. I ordered one bowl and waited 25 minutes. Ended up making me late for my shift. Not coming back again. Oh yeah and they only have two employees working.. Yet they charge 8 bucks for a bowl.. Must be too cheap to hire more people"}
{"text":"Tried two items here recently and I'm feeling healthier already. The coupons that arrived in the weekly flyer got me inside and the coupons were not shabby either, including free smoothies and BOGO as well. 
     My first acai bowl was not as big as some other I have seen, but it seemed to be pretty good until I sample others. It had fresh fruit, good granola and the acai mix. The smoothie is unusual because it contains almond milk and not yogurt like mainstream smoothies. It has a taste you need to adjust too, but in the end it was a good 350 calories for drinking. The place is small and contains alot of those stereotyped Scottsdale women, but you need something to look at while your pretending to be healthy once or twice a week."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with this place. I ordered the health nut shake for a pre-workout meal. I thought how can you go wrong with peanut butter & banana? Boy was I wrong. After 15 minutes of waiting I was handed the worst tasting shake I have ever had. Barely a hint of banana or peanut butter. It tasted like flavorless protein powder mixed with ice. Hopefully they just made it wrong and this is not the usual product."}
{"text":"This is a great juice spot. Comfortable, clean environment with both indoor and outside seating. Juice menu is short and sweet (literally). Prices were reasonable for both fresh juice and Scottsdale. 
I will be going back. Many juice combinations to try for both a healthy snack and for those days where I want juice for lunch.
Bonus, many, many attractive women hang around this place. Bonus points for eye candy."}
{"text":"Drinks are good, but very disappointing rewards program.  Buyer beware...you only get 1 credit per purchase no matter how many drinks you purchase. So instead of being efficient and ordering all drinks and paying once, they force you to hold up the line and purchase each drink individually.  Silly of them to not give credit for all drinks in one purchase.  Next time you go, buy each drink or item separately."}
{"text":"I would say this is my least favorite nektar location. Their juices are always good but their acai bowls always taste like they are using fruit that has been frozen for way too long. They have practically zero taste; it's like I'm eating purple ice. Seriously. 

Guys, you have to start using fruit that is fresh or that hasn't sat in the freezer for too long. 

I talked to the staff about the freezer burn taste and their response was, \"our sales have been way up and we're going through our supply like crazy, so it must be fresh.\"  Seriously?  Increased sales and going through stock does not equate to freshness, my friend."}
{"text":"The staff were very nice and patient waiting for us to order. My niece is vegan and was visiting from Missouri so this was a fun place to take her! My nephew and my boyfriend and I all really enjoyed it. I even had the ginger shot and was pleasantly surprised! Thanks Nekter!"}
{"text":"Super good açaí! There are lots of options and everything is customizable. The grab and go case has a lot as well!"}
{"text":"With our office being right up the street I often have to get something quick but want healthy too. The staff and food are always good and I am definitely a regular. The bowls are filling and so are the smoothies. If feeling sick, get a ginger shot!"}
{"text":"Love the bowls and the service. Jen was super nice and friendly. Appreciated a refreshing healthy snack and kind people"}
{"text":"For this particular visit I ordered through the app to skip the line. It was estimated to be ready in 30 minutes but it was already waiting for me in the fridge before then! Ordering through the app will also automatically give you a stamp on your mobile stamp card within 24 hours. After 10 visits, you'll receive one free item off the menu. 

All locations are very cute with their collage of vibrant picture posters on the wall. 
Their pitaya bowls are my favorite! If you want it in drink form - order a Pink Flamingo smoothie. 
Juices are always pricy wherever you go. I appreciate that Nekter has three different sizes to choose from and that you're able to build your own concoction with customized bases and ingredients. (If you love it, favorite the recipe on your app so you don't forget it!)"}
{"text":"Great staff. Consistent juices and lemon/ginger shots. They are always in awesome spirits and know the product. I had to get the boy a smoothie and can't have coconut so they told me their favorites and also provided alternatives. Love it. Please open even more locations so you can take more of my money. You can have it all."}
{"text":"Excellent juice bar, been here 3 times in the last week while in town on a business trip.  The quality was consistent each time.  Customer service was great too."}
{"text":"I always get the acai banana berry bowl, it's delicious, refreshing, and also filling! Great for lunch, although it's typically extremely busy during that time."}
{"text":"My new addiction. After a workout at Orange Theory I come here for a Acai Banana Berry Bowl or the PB bowl. Great stuff. Wi-Fi and happy, helpful workers complete the experience."}
{"text":"By far the worst Nekter in the valley. So dirty! The back where they make the food, has food everywhere and containers with dirty residue all over it. The people who work there are so unpleasant and are not welcoming. I asked for coconut flakes to be added on top of my bowl... they charged me for them but no coconut flakes to be found. My fiancé got his usual bowl but said it tasted not how it usually tastes. The fruit wasn't fresh. Honestly so disappointed since it's the closet Nekter to the house. Do yourself a favor and go to the other locations. Do not waste your time and money here. We will go back to the Scottsdale or Arcadia locations."}
{"text":"Good healthy options minus the fact that Rocky Mountain chocolate shares the same retail space. Kids size is perfect! And good snack options."}
{"text":"The pink flamingo smoothie makes me honestly feel like... I'm sitting on a beautiful beach.. perfect weather.. surrounded by beautiful women.. ahhhh so refreshing. Lol try it & you will fully understand what I mean lol"}
{"text":"Great juice and prompt service. Would have given it 5 stars but the bathroom was dirty."}
{"text":"My all-time favorite juice bar. I've gotten juice and an Açai bowl. Both are good, but I prefer the bowl. It has yummy granola and fruit ontop."}
{"text":"I have to say I wasn't horribly impressed here. I came all the way from Central Phoenix to try out Nekter's juices and instantly felt like I was an outsider. The girl at the counter was so completely unfriendly I wondered if she had somewhere better to be; she clearly didn't want to be there. I asked her what was good and she looked at me like I was an idiot and then offered no real help. When I decided on something I asked about adding protein, to which she again responded like I should just know that Nekter uses hemp protein although I didn't see it listed anywhere. I bought a $10 logo plastic cup with which I was supposed to get a free 16oz juice or smoothie, which didn't happen and when I called her on it she rolled her eyes. Since she had already rung me up, she told me to just tell them next time I come in that I didn't get it and they would honor it. Really? Although the smoothie I ordered was decent, it certainly didn't warrant the $20 price tag and the poor service. I'm thinking there probably won't be a next time."}
{"text":"Delicious healthy meal/snack/drink place on the go. Refreshing and healthy! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love love Nekter but this is for sure the worst location. Skimp on everything. So disappointed"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for Nektar to open. We definitely needed a juice/smoothie/acai bowl bar in Desert Ridge. The owner and staff are super friendly. We will definitely be visiting often. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Not clean- like at all (I am confused by the people who left a review saying it is clean, I come here a few times a week at various times of the day it is always messy), the staff is always chatting with each other even when there are customers waiting, staff unfamiliar with promotions going on. The drinks and shots are inconsistent. Every time I go up to order from everyone (besides the kind man who is there almost every day I am assuming he is the manager or lead) I feel as though they are irritated and I always tip. Another thing is that the staff will sample things in front of customer's who paid for the drink/shot if there are leftovers. Maybe wait until after we leave to do that. I am paying for a lot of money for a  drink and you have so much left over to make 2 more of my drinks and or shots... just does not seem right. I hope management steps in to give better training, consistency with the drinks/shots, and prioritizes customers first."}
{"text":"Anything I've ordered here has been great!  I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because sometimes the female employees can be a little crabby. Occasionally I'll have someone (usually one of the males) who will greet me when I enter, or say \"thank you\"..\"enjoy\"...\"have a good day\" when they hand me my order."}
{"text":"Have been coming into this location for some time now! The manager B and Zoey and staff are AMAZING! Super friendly, always greeting with smiles and now matter how busy they are they always ask how my day is! Super fun and clean location. I will never go anywhere else!!! There motto is \"Live the Nékter life\" it should also be \"Love the Nékter family\". If your in the surrounding area I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you stopping in and get your JUICE ON!"}
{"text":"Definitely the freshest ingredients I have ever had, or seen from a Juice Bar. The establishment is very clean and inviting. I have been to other Nekter locations and will only return to this location because of the next level customer service from the staff."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for quite sometime and love this place!  I was suggested to try the \"Buzz\" and it was delicious and gave me some energy as well.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I wish they would open more locations and maybe have a loyalty program."}
{"text":"Unbelievable!!! Yet another disappointing experience at this location!! I've been a regular Nékter customer for at least 2-3 yrs.. the Scottsdale locations are great!! Great service, always friendly and never any issues.. since DAY 1 this location has been plagued with slow service, broken air conditioning, faulty equipment and frankly staff that just don't care!!! We will never be back to this location!!!!"}
{"text":"Its so nice this is so close to me! Very friendly service. Love that I can get fresh juice without all the trouble. I ordered the beet juice and a Berry acia bowl. Both were very good. I also like the calories are posted underneath each item."}
{"text":"I think this one is super nicely decorated. And cozy. Just my opinion but nicer than Scottsdales!! Only 4* cause they need more help!"}
{"text":"Nektars Scoop Chocolate Bliss  is delicious.  I was very surprised.  They also let you sample the flavors. Under 200 cal a scoop , made with natural ingredients,  dairy, gluten free. Taste very close to ice cream. I cant wait to try the other flavors and have more of the chocolate bliss!"}
{"text":"My first NEKTER experience was a great one! A very trendy and fun place. The Superfood Bowls we had were beautifully crafted and unquestionably fresh and healthy! It was a bit expensive, but really is understandable since it is a full meal! Yummy!"}
{"text":"A fun little place to catch a veggie juice. They are relatively quick and very accommodating to suit your taste in making the juice a bit pricey."}
{"text":"First time at Nekter, I went with the Pink Flamingo smoothie! It was really good and drove me back for seconds a couple days later. Download the app for a free 16oz smoothie or juice!"}
{"text":"I really like the idea of this place. Making ice cream with no dairy and having it still taste amazing is an arduous task. The place is pretty small. Not too many people can stay inside at any given time. While we were there the music was super loud and we had to raise our voices to talk to each other. I can't think of a good explanation of why the music was super load at a juice bar. They had a special coupon to get a free scope of ice cream and the place was packed because of it. Then it took forever to get one scope of ice cream.

You have to park pretty far away but there is a lot in this area to see.

The employees were fun and always willing to help. It was our first time here and they helped us out ordering without any complaints.

This is a great place to check out. Defiantly recommend for others to try out."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location in the company. Priscilla & her staff are always on point & the products are consistently delicious."}
{"text":"Nekter Nekter Nekter.. I'll follow you even out of state. =] This location is in Vegas in the community of Summerlin! Nekter is my go to for juices, smoothies, and bowls. The good ones that I've tried include: \"The Buzz\", \"Toxin Flush\", \"The Little Beet\",  \"Health Nut\", \"Popeyes Acai\", and their bowls! The service here is pretty good and the wait wasn't that bad. Everything here tastes clean and fresh and is worthy of a visit. This is in a nice area with plenty of outdoor seating! When in Summerlin.. *Nekter* is a healthy option to swing by and get some.~"}
{"text":"I am completely OBSESSED with Nekter. My boyfriend discovered it a few months ago and since then, we have both been hooked!! Everything is so refreshing and delicious. The only thing I dislike that that its a little pricy, (not that it holds us back) and I also wish that they would display the nutritional information, mainly the calorie count. 

Other than that I love this place! Everyone is super nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"service is a little slow but the it is so worth the wait! the pitaya bowl is as good as it looks, it's bright pink and filled with amazing ingredients! it made me feel so full and satisfied after. also, Jenny is the nicest employee there! :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place, their juices are awesome, their cleanse even better! Can't wait to do the 2 day cleanse, sounds amazing!"}
{"text":"I had visited Nekter two other times this week, once in the afternoon and yesterday morning. I went for a third time this morning because their juice is quite good, and also reasonably priced compared to competitors. After telling my friend about this place, she asked me if I had a punch card with them, it's a pretty good deal: spend $25 and get a free 16oz juice. However this was never offered to me, and I didn't know about it until after I had purchased a few juices. 

The reason for the 1 star review is because I walked in this morning before work, and there were two staff members at the register. One staff member was showing the other how to do something on the register, not a problem, I understood this and I'm pretty forgiving, but I was standing there two feet away from them waiting and it was as if I was invisible. I waited some more..........no \"Hello,\" no \"We'll be right with you,\".........no acknowledgment at all. Feeling super awkward and unsure of how long I was going to be ignored for, I turned around, left the store and went to Juby True across the street.

I totally understand the need to train someone to do their job, but I think it's common courtesy to at least acknowledge your customers. I'm pretty sure I will not be returning here, as their customer service was non existent this morning."}
{"text":"Loved Nekter's acai bowls. I've had them twice now and it's great to see the calorie count and read the list of ingredients that go into them. The first time I went it took some time to get my bowl, so the second time I called ahead and had no problem getting in and out. Bright, fresh atmosphere and SUPER helpful and courteous staff."}
{"text":"Nothing better than a healthy juice or a perfect smoothie after a great workout!! Super happy to have a Nekter near my new home in my new home State of AZ :))"}
{"text":"Tried this place on opening day yesterday! They had $1 smoothies at the time I went. I forgot the name of the smoothie I had but it was a banana smoothie that had peanut butter but I replaced it with almond butter (had other stuff just forgot) but it was so fresh and tasty! Also friendly service! :) definitely a place to come back to!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I'm hesitant to go again. I've heard great things about this place so I'm wondering if I just caught them on an off day. I love açaí bowls. I ordered the peanut butter açaí bowl and took it Togo. Once I got home and tried it I was very surprised to find that it tasted awful. The toppings were good but the actual açaí part had almost no flavor, and the little flavor it did have was not exactly a pleasant one. It was a very light pink/purple color so I'm wondering if they forgot an ingredient or something. I didn't want to drive all the way back and after paying around ten dollars for it I tried to make the best and eat it, but ended up throwing it away.  I want to give it another try but I'm scared to waste another ten dollars. I'm giving it two stars just because the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Came here after a workout at the Sun Devil Fitness Center. We wanted to get a healthy snack after getting our \"Swole\" on. 

I got the chocolate \"ice cream\". It's a much healthier version (176 calories) and honestly tastes more chocolatey than other ice creams. The portion size is pretty small for costing $4.50, but that is my only complaint. 

The staff is friendly and efficient. A good treat for a 117 degree day"}
{"text":"I've only had juice here (no bowls). The juice was very tasty, and I love that it can be served over ice (def not an option on the east coast).
The juice was well priced.
The girl taking the orders just kept staring at my sneakers. Could have used a bit more in the 'pulse' department. But what do I care, I liked my juice.
RIGHT?"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fresh, healthy, and perfect for the person who is wanting to live a healthier lifestyle! Friendly customer service, but in particular Lexi is just amazing! She has a welcoming smile, great attitude, and truly defines hard worker with great customer service skills!"}
{"text":"Impressed with the variety.  Had the popeye acai smoothie and it was great.  The only drawback is it does take 30 minutes to get your order.  They have a hard time keeping up with the demand and were also out of all the pre-made juices in the refrigerator section.  I will be back but not if I need it to be a quickie.   Good prices compared to other juice bars in town, but I don't think they use organic produce."}
{"text":"Acai Bowl  was so pretty to look at I felt sad as I disturbed the presentation.   A good sized serving  with very fresh fruit being used."}
{"text":"My $9 24 oz \"smoothie\" was as thin as water. I ordered the Pineapple Paradise Smoothie. I asked if it was normally this thin and the girl said no and that she would put ice in it. Came back and basically threw the smoothie on the counter, said nothing, and walked in the back room. It taste awful. Basically I paid $9 for ice and and water with a little bit of pineapple flavor. This is my second negative experience here. I won't be back. Terrible customer service and terrible flavor. Overpriced product and untrained, rude employees."}
{"text":"This place can sometimes make my day. It's addicting. I'm on my third frequent flyer stamp card. If you fill one up you get a free drink. They have lots of great deals on cleanses, reusable cups, and gift cards. Every juice and smoothie I have ordered has been fresh, delicious, and super flavorful. The acaii bowls are amazing and enough for a meal. The staff is very friendly and quick. Try a ginger shot with cayenne pepper! That will wake you up!"}
{"text":"Nothing but great experiences with Nekter and with this specific location. My all time favorite fresh breakfast or snack. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This juice joint is the cheapest one I've been able to find in town! I recommend getting the medium with ice - it'll last you all day!

They have snacks, smoothies, acai bowls, and ginger/wheatgrass shots. I can appreciate that it is around restaurants and coffee shops so that I can pop in if I am out with a crowd that isn't a juicing crowd and I won't be a hindrance. 

I love their juice cleanses! They work wonders on restoring your GI tract. Although the cleanses are a bit on the pricey side, if you wanted to stay on the cheaper end of the spectrum you could definitely just come here 3 times in the day and not exceed $30! 

A must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Good place, good smoothies, good juices, good little bars and balls of protein, good acai bowls.  It's a decent place for sure.  

It get's 3 stars for being completely over priced.  I just paid $11 for a \"Health Nut\" smoothie.  That's just simply too much for a friggen smoothie.  Notice I said everything was good...not great.  There is nothing super special enough here to justify an $11 smoothie.  I could have bought a gallon of cashew milk, a jar of peanut butter, and a bundle of bananas with $11.  

If you don't mind the steep prices, I'd say give it a shot."}
{"text":"So this place is right around the corner from my house and I can't believe that I had not been yet! I had this misconception that juice places were always $9+ for a fresh juice so i've just been juicing at home. But news to me, I was wrong! A 16 oz juice or smoothie is under $6 here!! I was so surprised by their prices and will absolutely be back for more juice in the future. Juicing at home can be tedious and does tend to make a mess, so when I get the occasional hankering, I will head to Nekter! I ordered the Tropical Cooler smoothie and added strawberries to it. It was DELICIOUS and quite filling! I can't wait to try more of their yummy juices and smoothies. 

Major props to Nekter for making fresh juices and smoothies affordable!! 

Cheers, 
Hailey"}
{"text":"It's really nice to see a juice bar so close to the areas I frequent. I am an avid juicer at home, but I will sometimes buy juice if not to compare my homeade concoctions to what's being served to the public.

I had \"The Buzz\" (carrot, orange, lemon and ginger). This drink is almost entirely carrot, as the drink is near-neon orange. It tastes exactly as it is made: carrot and orange as the base, with a bit of lemon for a bit of tangy and a hing of ginger to wake you up. Overall, a well made drink. The store was nice and clean inside and the customer service was great. The store opened 3 days ago, so the employees were still training, but this did not dampen the service. I look forward to enjoying juice from Nekter again soon."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have yet to try something that I didn't like, everything on the menu is delicious. Some ingredients might sound strange at first but they actually blend really well. The staff are always friendly and courteous. If you download the free app it works as a punch card toward a free order. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst nekter from the few I've been to. The workers talk to their friends while one guy makes smoothies. Bad service in general as well. The smoothies are terrible. Won't be visiting this one again. Have gone twice and the first time i practically had to chew my tropical cooler (what i always get). And the second one was so watered down it wasn't even funny. Barely green at all, very watery. A waste of ten bucks. Don't go to this locat"}
{"text":"The place looks great.  A very clean, modern vibe.  Staff were very nice and the prices are very good!  My green juice was very nice and I think it's good that they also offer a \"build your own\" juice and smoothie.  It took 7-10 minutes for the juice, but honestly it's worth the wait because they make it fresh.  Will return!"}
{"text":"I love this Nektar!! The staff is super friendly and nice. Always my go to at Tempe Marketplace!"}
{"text":"First time trying an acai bowl at Nekter. I've had their smoothies before and can say that the smoothies are good. I've had the health nut and mango delight. I do want to try more of the smoothies and will definitely give an update once I get to try more on the menu. The presentation of the store is clean and the service is smooth. The staff today is very welcoming. 

Currently trying the acai mango bowl and it's pretty good. It is topped with granola, bananas, and coconut flakes. Yummy! I think I'll have the pitaya next."}
{"text":"My only complaint about Nektar is I wish they sold plain orange juice! They have so many juices but no prices listed for any single fruit juice. I wonder if there is some sort of secret menu for that?

This location outside of Macy's is really small; I generally get my juice to go so it isn't a problem for me. However, if you are the kind of person who wants to hang out after getting your juice, the number of tables here may not cut. I like the decor. I never buy from the cooled shelving they have, but I have heard good things about their cleanses. 

The charcoal lemonade was too sour for me, but that's a lemonade issue, not a charcoal issue. The Sublime is my favorite, go-to juice. Not too sweet but not too bitter, I get a medium because if you get ice they put it in the bigger cup, and I don't know how that would work with their largest size? The acai bowls are pretty legit here for a snack. The only reason I normally don't go for them is because for a snack they have a lot of calories."}
{"text":"I am Nicaraguan and my father (who is straight outta the jungle) always has educated me on our roots. I am also a lover of all fruit ever. It's pretty passionate actually. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE FRUIT IS DRAGON FRUIT. In Nica, we call it Pitaya. When I saw one of their acai bowls with my faaaaavvv I nearly drooled. Pitaya acai bowl.

That is all.

{"text":"Came here like a week ago. Had great choices!
Very Delicious and exceed my expectations!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Nekter for only about a month now, but I find myself visiting at least twice a week.  Their Toxin Flush is my absolute favorite.  It provides an amazing amount of greens and still has a sweeter taste to satisfy any sweet craving I may be having that day.
I currently on my 2nd day of their juice cleanse.  I started the 1st day with the Classic cleanse, and my 2nd day with the Advanced cleanse.  This is the first juice cleanse that I've done before so it's a bit hard to not think about food, but the juices they provide really satisfy you to help you get through the day."}
{"text":"Very clean and hip location, as most Nekter's are!  However when I walked in there were a bunch of younger adults (maybe teenagers) standing around talking outside blocking the door.  I made my way past them and inside where I waited for someone to help me. 
Turns out the female who was running the cash register and taking orders was outside talking.  So I had to wait for her to finish her conversation and come inside.  A bit unprofessional but she was young and I wasn't in a rush.....it just irked me a bit.
I ordered the Toxin Flush and got my drink after a short wait.  It tasted a lot more like apple juice than veggies and it was also a lighter color green than I normally get.  But I didn't want to have to bother them and ask them to remake it, so I stuck with it.  Still great! But I was nervous it might have been more sugar than I was anticipating.
I think I'll be sticking with my Phoenix and Tempe locations from now on."}
{"text":"The Chocolate Bliss and Charcoal Vanilla Skoops are seriously SO good! Do yourself a favor and try them before these flavors get replaced.  Apparently they rotate flavors every few months. 

I love their beet juice. So delicious! I usually have a hard time deciding between the beet juice and a green juice, so I just ask them to throw some greens in with the beet juice. Give it a try if you are like me and can't make up your mind."}
{"text":"Just ordered this place through UberEats and their smoothies are amazing! Did the Asai and Orange. Amazing. Worth the price for the quality and taste of these. Highly recommend for something cool and refreshing."}
{"text":"I don't like healthy stuff but I like their stuff. So far everything I've had has been good  my taste buds are  extremely satisfied."}
{"text":"I have recently become obsessed with this place! I've only had their juices, as I tend to be a creature of habit, but I must say the Toxin Flush is very fresh, tastey, and  refreshing! 
When you walk into a Jamba Juice, your hit with an overwhelming smell of oranges. But when you walk into Nekter it feels like you walked into a produce fridge. It's a very fresh and clean feeling. 
The drinks take a bit to make since it's all made fresh to order, but it's definitely worth the wait. 
I will one day attempt to try one of their daily or weekly full juice cleanses. But until then, I'll keep coming back for individual drinks!"}
{"text":"I try to juice a few times a month, not because I love it, but because I want to be a little healthy and keep weight off.  My taste buds still don't think the green juices are yummy, they just indulge me, however the Pink Flamingo is so delicious, I am sure it is pure sugar, love my bright pink drink.  I get a little upset when they don't tell me ahead of time that they are out of Pitaya, which is what makes this drink bright pink.  I might have one of their bowls soon, some sound really good."}
{"text":"I was feeling congested so stopped in here to get a ginger shot. Felt much better after I took it! It's hard to down but cleared my breathing.

I also has the toxin flush. It's probably the best green juice I've had. I love it, refreshing. 

The best thing about Nektar is they press the juice while you wait. This way you can customize.

Plenty of parking, next to Bikram, orange theory and Sprouts."}
{"text":"Yum! Perfect for my tastes of morning pick-me-up!
The clerk was extremely helpful in my choosing as these natural ingredients have benefits to my health.
I'm coming back!!"}
{"text":"The best acai bowls! I got the app and when you sign up you get a free 16oz juice or smoothie! Try the toxin flush for a juice you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My dad stopped by Nekter yesterday on his way to work to get his normal morning jolt of veggie goodness, however, it was not as he expected. Not sure who made his \"The Greenie\" but it was terrible. Now I realize \"The Greenie\" contains parsley, spinach, kale, celery, cucumber, lemon and apple -- and you would think that it would taste like a garden or like a liquid salad, right? Wrong!!! It was disgusting. 

Here's my theory on what happened... Whoever made it didn't make enough to fill up the cup to the top so they MacGyver'd it and added lemon water to make up the difference. I tried it and couldn't taste ANY of the veggies in it to save my life, all I could taste was watered down lemon water, with a hint of greens. When paying $7.50 for a green juice, I would expect it to have just that... GREEN juice, not watered down lemon water. I may give Nekter another shot, but I'm on the \"3 strikes, you're out\" policy... So, you have two more tries."}
{"text":"I'm having my first experience at the Nekter Juice Bar and it's great. The health nut is super tasting and the staff are lovely and its perfectly located at Kierland in Scottsdale, AZ"}
{"text":"Friendly and knowledgable staff. First time in a Nekter so I had a few questions about the cleanses and juices. They answered all my questions with a smile and they make great juices and smoothies. I wish them great success! 
Oh..I can't wait to try the acai bowl!"}
{"text":"Went in and got an amazing juice and had great customer service. The Asian girl was extremely helpful and answered questions I had about the cleanse. 

If you're looking for a juice cleanse this place is the least expensive and they have grab and go bags fresh pressed daily that contain the 6 juices you need. If you need a cleanse on a whim and don't want to wait or pre order just stop in and get their blue bag to go. 

The acai bowls looked amazing and their smoothies did too. I'll be back soon!! 

Only sucky thing is they don't have a land line phone. The company routes all calls through Corporate. Weird and not convenient"}
{"text":"This place is Good for Healthy drinks. Came here before and sometimes after my workout at LA Fitness. Fantastic! And the drinks taste really good!!!"}
{"text":"Quality juices/bowls. Service is slow and they often run out of various types of fruit toppings for their acai bowl."}
{"text":"Nekter Juice Bar is the cutest little juice bar located in the heart of Scottsdale in the Chipotle/Five Guys plaza across from the Scottsdale Quarter. Their menu consists of juices + smoothies + cleanses, acai bowls, on the go drinks, etc. I've experimented with the entire menu and I haven't found one thing I haven't enjoyed!! 

Bowls 
- My \"go to\" is their famous acai berry bowl. They're super filling and the fruit is always fresh and the granola has the perfect crunch! 
- The Pitaya bowl is also super yummy and refreshing! Love that they top it with coconut! 

 Smoothies
- I love the Health Nut with almond butter, bananas, vanilla cashew milk, protein, and agave nectar! So yummy!! It's like a healthy version of a chocolate shake! Perfect if you have a sweet tooth and want something indulging! The Date Nut is a similar version and is also super tasty!! 
- Tropical Cooler is like a citrus refresher! Perfect for the AZ heat! It's blended with spinach, kale, pineapple, bananas, coconut butter, and coconut water! 
- Pink Flamingo is another fave!! It has Pitaya which is an exotic fruit and gives it that vibrant pink color, strawberries, pineapple, agave nectar, and coconut water! 

Juices
- The Greenie
Parsley, spinach, kale, celery, and apple which ties everything together! It's definitely a meal in a cup and is their signature drink!
- Green Apple Detox
Granny Smith Apple, cucumber, lemon, kale, fennel, and ginger! It's super tart and refreshing! Who needs coffee when you can drink this? Totally gives you a burst of energy in the morning! 
- The Sublime 
Parsley, kale, spinach, lime, orange, and cucumber. It's more citrusy and super tasty! 

The ambience of this juice joint just makes you want to #livethenekterlife and live a healthier lifestyle! The quotes on the wall are super motivating, and I absolutely adore the decor. \"Be fearlessly authentic\" is a quote I now always go by everyday thanks to Nekter! One cool thing I just found out is that you can order online, or on the Nekter app and skip the lines. You can also earn points, or what they like to call \"fruits\" if you order on the app. WHAT? 

The staff is always super friendly and always makes my experience super enjoyable which is why I always come to this location. The general manager (I sadly can't remember his name), but he's definitely a people pleaser and always makes me and my family feel welcomed. Thank you Nekter for changing my life. Living the Nekter life is not just a hashtag, it's a lifestyle that changed my love for food and to live a more healthy and substantial life! Be fearlessly authentic taught me to always take risks and to live the life you want to live! Honestly and fearlessly!!"}
{"text":"2nd visit & this place is such a great addition to the neighborhood. I love the pumpkin pie smoothie (seasonal) you must try this treat. Made with agave, banana, nut milk, nutmeg, dates, pumpkin purée. They have acai bowls too."}
{"text":"I have had several bad experiences with this specific location. From not having materials to make things,  just not opening and horrible attitudes. This Nékter location is terrible for the franchise! Been to several other locations and this is hands down the worst! 

This morning I placed a mobile order to be picked up at 7:30am and no one was there. They facility was completely dark. An employee of another business came out and said there cars are not even here. So annoying! So now what with my mobile order. 

The dysfunction comes from the top. No management. Employees get by with murder here. Stay away. Go to a different location!"}
{"text":"I went to a different place (bowlology or something?) first based on reviews but their menu looked blah so we came here and I'm so glad we did!!! 

I got my four year old a pancake bar which her and my husband devoured. She also got a pink flamingo and drank the whole thing (perfect size and great flavor) 

My husband got the banana berry smoothie and loved it. Their lemonades taste kind of watered down. I wish they'd put out taste testers of them! 

I got the green toxin cleanse juice over ice and it's intensely parsley but that's the point. I LOVED my pitaya bowl. Delicious!!! I didn't think I could eat the whole thing but I did! Perfect combo of toppings and everything. So happy with my choice and I'll be back as often as I can afford this deliciousness."}
{"text":"Always a delicious healthy treat! Customer service is always great. Nekter has your juices, smoothies, and acai bowls. Urban atmosphere and always clean and tidy."}
{"text":"We love Nektar! Clean, fast, friendly, and most importantly healthy! Their Mango Delight is delicious!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. Used to be great but now is inconsistent and sometimes downright disgusting. Yesterday I threw my $8 drink in the garbage. Never coming here again. The one at downtown Summerlin is also awful now. From now on Acai to the T only for me!!!! Waste of time and money!!!!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here because I wanted to be healthy. The Pitaya bowl caught my eye due to the girlish, bright, fuschia color. It came with bananas, coconut butter, coconut flakes, granola, pineapple, agave nectar, etc. It was only 440 calories and $7.95. I liked it a lot. I can picture myself stopping by to order this again and I would like to try their other acai bowls and juices. I ate this for lunch and was slightly hungry after. The food smell at surrounding restaurants in Downtown Summerlin were overwhelming so I had to get out of there quick. 

No complaints about the service and the speed in which my bowl was ready. The juice bar has a cute decor too. They also sell juice cleanses which I'm curious about even though I have mixed feelings about them. I would have to do more research and read reviews before I spend $$$ on these juice cleanses. I will update if I do decide to try them out."}
{"text":"Loveeeee the pink flamingo! Great for their smoothies and juices. All nekters run different promotions."}
{"text":"Feels good from the inside out.  Love the honest taste and fair price. I just wish it was across the street from my home!"}
{"text":"There isn't much seating so don't plan on staying for hours to do some work.  The smoothies seemed better than the juices."}
{"text":"I love supporting Local businesses! And this place is set up with bright welcoming colors. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable in recommending something since it was my first time. I had order 2 medium smoothies and mine was delicious. I definitely like the cashew milk in there. I am a big fan of this spot because their drinks are good for the soul- non diary juices and smoothies and vegan goodies! PLUS there are comfy looking seats to hang out and chill. They also provide a 30 day supply cleanse ready to go in the cooler. I am definitely going to be back when I am on that side of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  The bowls are always amazing.  Everything always tastes fresh and will be coming back weekly."}
{"text":"Stopped here before a movie with the family. Shared two bowls and loved them! Sundevil bowl and the Açaí Peanut Butter bowl."}
{"text":"I am visiting my sister form out of town.  I decided I needed a nutrition punch and this place was only a couple miles away! We had the toxin flush, the greenie, the smoothie with pataya, and the chocolate smoothie (I forget the names of the smoothies).  All were delightful! I will definitely be going back multiple times before my trip is over."}
{"text":"I come here almost everyday - the health nut smoothie is favorite and I add extra pea protein. I also get a ginger shot every time and I love it!!!! The people who work here are really nice and the place itself is always extremely clean!"}
{"text":"Had the peanut butter bowl and it was great! I can't really comment on the attitudes of the employees, there were only 2 and it was busy. The girl at the register took my order and the other girl was making orders. It was delicious though! Best bowl I've had in town. I like that they just do juice and bowls rather than seafood and fruit like bowlology. I like that place too but I'm always paranoid that there's seafood in my açaí bowl lol"}
{"text":"I have never had an all fresh juice drink with such fresh veggies I of course thought the worst thinking it would be bitter or just because it was green it would taste strange 
Boy was I wrong I am I love it is a real treat to give yourself a healthy drink like they serve here 
The staff has been off and on with their cheerfulness but maybe I just got one in a bad mood or on a really busy day 
Try them if you would like to try juicing yourself before you go out and spend all the money on doing them at home it sure helped me decide I now want to juice at home"}
{"text":"Last week I went and ordered a açai bowl and took it to go with a lid. I noticed immediately that I didn't get the extra fruit that I paid for but they were busy, so I decided it wasn't a big deal. But then as I started eating it once I got to my car, I noticed the  acai mixture wasn't even filled to the top, and over half of it was frozen. I know you can order it over the phone and pick it up, but I did not do that, so I'm not sure why it was frozen at all. It changes the flavor and I was so disappointed how quickly and poorly it was put together. When I called to explain what happened, the worker seemed super annoyed and irritated by complaint. It was just all over a bad experience and sadly this isn't the first time it's happened at this location and I don't plan on returning there!"}
{"text":"The man at the register was really nice.. but that's the only nice thing I could say about this location.. everyone that ordered after me got their order first .. the guy that was making my order was basically Lollygagging and taking his sweet time easily distracted by the female customers , picked up a banana peel & tossed it in the trash, kept tugging at his pants to pull them up and went back to prepping without removing his gloves, washing & putting new gloves on.. I waited way too long for something that took maybe 3 minutes"}
{"text":"Polite, friendly and efficient.. And healthy! I'm hooked on the acai bowls after working out and Nekter delivers. It's in a rest location and close to my place so I've been here a lot. My favorite bowl is the pittaya and they indulge my requests with a smile. If you're getting healthy or looking for an acai bowl in Arcadia, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I can't help but wake up every morning now and resist the urge to spend all my money at Nekter. Their Acai bowls are unbelievable. I have tried the Acai pineapple, pitaya, and berry bowl. The juices are amazing too. I really don't have anything bad to say about this place except I wish it were all organic fruits and vegetable. If you go once, you will be hooked!"}
{"text":"I got the pb bowl as a blended smoothie! The girl working was so nice and made it special for me. I highly recommend it. Watch out for the blonde guy though - he can be moody! Lol"}
{"text":"Like the smoothies.  Open up in Nor Cal Bay Area."}
{"text":"Update: Ava has invited us back and suggested some alternative smoothies to try which may be suitable for a younger palate. Will update this review further after we check it out. Added back a star based on the A-grade customer service response.

Update 2: We've been back twice now. Pleased to say that based on Ava's suggestion we tried the Berry Banana Burst and my kid loves it and is now asking for it as a treat on occasion. Plus, last time we were in my wife tried the PB bowl and said it was delicious. Talk about a turnaround! Congrats to Ava for saving a customer as I'm pretty sure we would not have returned had we not been contacted. For now I'll leave it at a three star, which is my normal \"I'll likely return\" rating - 4 stars is extremely rare for me, and 5 is reserved for places I daydream about and would travel to a different country just to eat at. All I can say is, try different flavours - in our experience some of them taste like crap but as I've recently learned, some are actually pretty good."}
{"text":"I've been feeling sluggish so I decided to cleanse a bit. I'm loving Nekter! I've cleansed before and I didn't like how the juice at (insert competitor's name here) tasted. Here everything tastes so fresh!"}
{"text":"Wow, grab a bunch of veggies in their pressed juices to start your day.  Folks are very friendly; at 2nd visit, staff putting in ponytail while behind the counter. Just a bit more diligence with the hair hygiene may be appropriate. 

I did enjoy the juices regardless & love this option in Arcadia."}
{"text":"Waited over 25 minutes to get my acai bowl.. there was only 2 customers in front of me and 4 works in the back...
On top of waiting so long the acai bowl was plain, not enough honey, and not sweet. Pretty horrible experience"}
{"text":"Exceptional juice. Cool staff. Crazy good Açaí bowl. This is my go to place when I'm working in town."}
{"text":"I loved my juice, it wasn't too sweet. The place is really clean and organized and they made my juice really quickly. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this location! Staff is super nice and our drinks are always made so well! Continue the great work and fantastic customer service!

If you are new to juicing, try the Buzz, it's awesome! Perfect to boost your vitamin c and the flavors are OUT OF THIS WORLD! They offer other items like smoothies and acacia bowls as well. 

Make sure to download the app, you can earn free drinks and it keeps you in the know."}
{"text":"Sean is the best! He is totally knowledgeable and is super helpful when coming to find the right blend!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the smoothies are always very refreshing. The employees are super friendly. The wait is worth it because the smoothies are always so good."}
{"text":"Refreshing!  For so many reasons. 
1. Staff - Friendly, kind, honest and fast!  I was blown away by how quickly this sweet girl could juice the amount of fruits and veggies she did in just 8 minutes!  She laughed when I mentioned it looks like a workout.  She said her favorite part is being able to provide fresh fast nutrition for people who are looking for a really healthy alternative to some of the other options out there. Such a sweet gal!
2. Juice was FRESH!  I mean literally I got to watch as she took whole veggies and put them straight into my drink.  You don't get much better than that!  There is no question with Nekter about what is going into my beverage!  
3. Family Owned!  I had no idea that this location was family owned and operated.  I love the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.  If there is ever an opportunity for me to make my purchases with families who live in my community, own businesses in my community and raise kids in my community you better believe I am going to make sure I spend my money there!  
4. Refreshingly Clean!  - This location did a great job making sure everything was clean and sanitary.  This goes back to the amazing staff they have but it is just something nice to point out.  Even the restroom was immaculate.  

A must stop if you are feeling a juice fix on the north side of town.  Even if you are a little further away it's worth the drive to keep it local!  

**I ordered the large Buzz with an added green apple and turmeric and light ice.  Delicious and I'm thinking it was what helped me stay healthy during the peak of flu season!"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that they have so much turnover and what appears to be little to no training. Very seldom do I see the same employee twice.  And I have yet to get my order correct, not once. 
Today was another grand slam. All I asked for was a banana berry bowl with EXTRA granola. When They handed me the completed order (or so they thought) they forgot the extra granola.  So, they took my bowl back completely remade my order extracted all of the granola and then gave me a 16 ounce cup of granola. It didn't matter mind you that they charge me for EXTER  granola. So they knew what the order was supposed to be, which was not to have granola on the side. 
None of these errors are monumental but they are consistent. And if you own this company you should be mortified and the loss of revenue and lack of productivity has got to be staggering.
The young employee apologized numerous times for the delay and errors but I'm quite sure she had no idea what the errors even were. 
The owner should invest some time in training his employees. It's a great concept but it's going to drop off quickly.  
Providing excellent service and completing orders correctly, is the starting point in retail these days; there's no exception."}
{"text":"Very clean and the prices are extremely competitive.  I couldn't believe a 32 oz was 8.75.  I have been paying 12.99 at wholefoods for same thing."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved back to AZ from CA I couldn't find a place with decent acai bowls. So you can imagine my excitement after 5 years of searching when I came across this slice of heaven! Best ones yet! Haven't tried the smoothies/juices because I'm such a fan of the bowls but I'm sure they are just as tasty."}
{"text":"Solid every time the customer service here is on-point and the young lady put straws and napkins in my drink holder and bag, I could have done it but she took the initiative to make the little things count."}
{"text":"We went around an outside mall in the scorching heat. We needed a lot of water or anything liquid to hydrate the body. 
We decided to have some drinks here. I love smoothie so I chose the berry blast and my husband chose the charcoal lemonade in the bottle.

My smoothie was delicious and the berry flavor was very tasty. The charcoal lemonade was very refreshing, quite lemony taste. Charcoal lemonade hm quite different. 

The place wasn't too big, but it was a big result for the body after having some smoothie or bottle cold drinks here."}
{"text":"*****Read the comment from management in photo below**** I emailed them like they asked and 22 days later no response!!!!

 Came here for a smoothie for my daughter and it took at least 20 minutes to get it. Once I got it they didn't even fill it up to the top. You spend over six dollars for a smoothie and you expect to get six dollars worth. I believe I saw the owner or at least manager in the store but he was too busy talking to someone rather than looking at all the customers just sitting there waiting for their items they purchased. This store is dirty and the bathroom was disgusting. If you are providing a service make sure your store is adequately staffed. I highly recommend going to other Nekter stores and avoiding this location.

The \"business owner\" should be ashamed of themselves for not holding up to the Nekter brand. Ready other reviews for this location. Shame on you for not doing anything about your poor service."}
{"text":"I've written a review about a different location, but was passing by and thought I'd stop in for a quick breakfast. The man working was very nice and told me about their current holiday special: spend $25 and get $5 free. Doesn't take much to convince me and I do like the menu here!

This location is a lot smaller than the one on Scottsdale- limited seating and decor is definitely lacking. I ordered the PB Acai bowl to-go. He clarified after ringing me up the PB not the Berry bowl and went to make it. When I got home I realized he gave me the Acai Banana Berry bowl. It was still great of course, but not what I had ordered. Regardless, still like this place and guess it was time to try something different. 

Try it out, but maybe check your oder before leaving!"}
{"text":"I've tried Nekter multiple times and each time the wait has been minimum 15 minutes even when it looks empty. It's not a place you should expect to run in and out of. 

Their PB acai bowl was delicious and even more filling than I thought it would be. It was pricey, but not more expensive than any of their other competitors. Definitely hit the spot and was a great breakfast!

On the few times I have grabbed their pre-bottles juices I was very disappointed. I tried their Raspberry Slimmer, which was just ok. Wouldn't get it again, but wasn't terrible either. It was nothing special and definitely not worth the price. Protein Grab n' Go had almonds, dates, nutmeg, cinnamon, and vanilla bean. That sounded amazing, but tasted more like watered down almond milk with a hint of cinnamon and grainy consistency. 

Definitely wouldn't recommend it for just their juice, but if you like acai bowls it is worth trying. Just make sure you aren't in a hurry!"}
{"text":"This is so overpriced and the young people who work there have no people skills and are not service oriented.  The bathroom is gross and if you don't like something it's just tough luck.  Smoothies are inconsistent depending on who makes them."}
{"text":"So I came here with a group of girls for a quick snack during our lunch break from our Retreat and it's a cute place. It's on the small side though. Already about nine of us filled half the seating area lol. 

The worker @ cash was really nice and friendly. Sorry I don't remember his name. I ordered the PB Bowl. It has Acai, banana, strawberries, dates, peanut butter, and housemate vanilla cashew milk blended together. Topped with two strawberries, banana and granola. The amount I paid to the amount I got was...yeah worth it I say. I also bought a bag of chocolate bananas lol. Those are GOOD!! 

It did take a awhile for me to get my bowl, I know there was a few people ahead of me though. I believe there was only one person making the bowls so it did take longer than I thought.

The bowl was good. I liked it. I would get it again if I ever go back to AZ or Scottsdale lol.

My friend bought one of the grab n go protein drinks. The vanilla one. It was...interesting. It didn't go with my taste buds, but I'm sure people love them! :]

Oh I also had a sip of my other friends smoothie. The Chocolate Dream. That was GOOD! I really liked it. I don't think she did so much though lol. But like I said, this place will go with certain people's taste buds. :D"}
{"text":"Indeed, I am a fan!!!  Ever since I had an acai bowl near Redondo Beach, I've been craving one.  I've made it but sometimes it's easier to just buy it and now, I can get it at Nekter Juice Bar.  It is sooooo good and sooo yummy and sooo full of good stuff, nutritious and is satisfying as well...  Nekter has a vast menu of juices and smoothies, pre packed juice cleanse and raw food choices.  I heart this place and will definitely, definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"So expensive for the small smoothie you get.  Plus the flavor isn't amazing.  I will stick to Tropical Smoothie Cafe for larger/cheaper/tastier smoothies.  We bought 3 and one went to waste because my daughter just didn't care for it."}
{"text":"Nice juices, smoothies & acai. Good pricing and menu options. Nice helpful and quick service and a clean modern space. Took off one star for not being organic but no other complaints!"}
{"text":"I stopped in today after yoga and enjoyed a refreshing watermelon cooler.  The space was really nice - great place to read a book or do some work and enjoy your juice.  The staff was really friendly and there were many juice and smoothie options to choose from."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and super fast. Love their music every time I come here for my lunch break! Place is very clean and not too big.  They use fresh fruits! Never frozen!  Use their app every-time and  after 10th purchase you get a free bowl or juice! Wowzaaa!"}
{"text":"great customer service was recommended the charcoal lemonade and will definitely come back for an acai bowl"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I went in last week and noticed that the blender right next to the cashier was dirty and had dust on top. The floors and carpets were not cleaned. I've been coming here for about 8 months and every time I go in I notice the lack of customer service, but most importantly sanitation and the employees not being clean after each use of blenders and not changing/cleaning down the tables properly. I've been in the food and beverage industry for three years and I know how the protocols inside a kitchen work. This is defiantly not something that the health inspector in Arizona would approve of."}
{"text":"Love everything here and service is good. I just wish it was all organic...if you are looking for healthy and something to cleanse it should be organic! I would give 5 stars otherwise."}
{"text":"I went to buy a juice and the girls working didn't even acknowledge that I was in the store as they were busy making other juices.  I sat down to let them finish making the other customers orders.  A family walked in and the employees acknowledged them right away and took their orders.   The girls were so oblivious I don't even think they knew that I left nor knew that I was there. It is quite a shame that I will never be a customer of Nekter again as I am a regular juice consumer; particularly vegetable juices I will never ever refer this place to anybody.  Save yourself the hassle and go buy your juice at Sprouts. Sprouts makes it fresh too."}
{"text":"Meh. The bathroom smelled like sewage. Our smoothies were okay. The service was okay. It was pricy, but I'm not sure it was worth it. Also was not made aware of their student discount."}
{"text":"Love this place, best juice bar around! Love the acai bowls and juices. Fresh and delicious. Highly recommend. They also have a great apps you can use to get rewards."}
{"text":"4 customers in store Saturday at 5 pm (and about 10 teenagers who didn't seem to be customers). Ordered a smoothie with couple additives (spinach and protein). Took over 15 minutes for order to be made and we were second customer. No smoothies were made for any customers the first 10 min there. They were calling out names of people that weren't there to see if they still needed to make drinks because order receipts weren't organized (I assume they were earlier patrons). One lady behind us got a return and left because of wait, but we weren't in rush so we stayed. When drink can't it tasted good (although not sure it contained additives- I couldn't see any green particles for spinach we ordered and by default I had to assume no protein in shake). Not sure I'll return, had two experiences with not the best service. They tried hard and were understaffed but I think we will go somewhere else next time. $10 for a smoothie with this experience just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Hey make a amazing green juice. Taste super healthy and it's the only place you can get green juice around in Mesa"}
{"text":"I went on a family trip from LBC to AZ. There was a lot of eating out which I'm not used to. I was craving nourishment and was surprised to see a Nekter in Mesa (haven't been to AZ in about 5 yrs). I was even more surprised that they have a location in Redlands, CA too when I dropped off family! Compared to the Redlands location (I got the same drink), this Mesa location was much better! I agree with one of the other reviewers, definitely the cutest Nekter I've been to! (out of Long Beach, Bella Terra, Brea and Redlands locations) happy to see this company growing; I hope they don't compromise on ingredients as it grows."}
{"text":"I got the mango delight. Super tasty. Just very expensive. $6.74 for a 16oz? 
I went to \"splurge on myself\" but just too pricey to go back."}
{"text":"The 1 star is based on the customer service not the food. The lady at the register was really unfriendly and made us feel like a huge inconvenience for asking for a cup of water. She then asked if I wanted to buy a water bottle and again I said nope I'd like a cup of water please.  Her response told me she did not like that at all. 
AND they were out of granola which is one of the main things I wanted here. Not coming back to this one"}
{"text":"I love their acai bowls!

Their produce is always fresh and the staff is always friendly. I had an issue with an online order because they ran out of an ingredient to make an acai bowl but they were able to credit me for another bowl for the next time I came it. Keep up the great work guys  :)"}
{"text":"Love their acai bowls, but this place is horribly managed and understaffed. The last few times we've been the waits have been incredibly long, the place looks trashed (see picture), and the employees seem mad and flustered. Once they were completely out of bananas and last time they were out of apples...this is a big problem when your whole business is fruit bowls/juices/smoothies. They really need to get it together at this location."}
{"text":"Really nice juice bar. Their smoothies are delicious and my favorite is by far the almond butter health nut. I've tried a few other smoothies and haven't been disappointed. The staff is always friendly and the place is very clean and well designed."}
{"text":"Literally my go to place in Cali. I moved here last week and gave this location a try. I walked in yesterday, there was no line, nobody waiting around and yet it took me 38 minutes to get one drink! It was incredibly hot in there, no air conditioning and I could not figure out for the life of me why they were moving so slow but I will say... I will not be going back. With a line out the door in Cali I never waited longer than 15. To add insult to injury, my juice wasn't cold at all... Almost like they used warm vegetables and didn't put any ice. I am not one to rant (read my other reviews) but this experience was awful to say the least... So disappointed"}
{"text":"My first time here at nekter juice bar it nice clean and staff was friendly my son loves his pink flamingo drink"}
{"text":"Great drinks but today was the second day in a row that we waited over 20 minutes for two drinks.  The gals working both Friday and this morning were very nice and were working as fast as they could but there is nothing they could have done working the entire store by themselves.  There needs to be more than one person working here.  There was one couple a head of us this morning who ordered two bowls and one drink so when we arrived there was no one at the register as she was in back making their order.  9 min later she appeared to take our order and apologize.  Again this was not her fault as she had no help. Another 15 min later we had our drinks.  Although I love these drinks I'm not sure I will return unless staffing issues get addressed."}
{"text":"Love Nektar and the selection they have is great. Wish they offered organic choices. Great place to hang and have a healthy meal!"}
{"text":"Nekter's ice cream is incredible! The strawberry tastes so fresh and the chocolate will satisfy the strongest chocolate craving. It's great to eat something that I know is clean. I think I have a new addiction - my wallet may be in trouble!"}
{"text":"Great place,  but not many smoothies. Make sure u look at the menu b4 going. Couldn't ck in from inside - said it couldn't find me/my loc. Make sure to check in down the street & get ur coupon b4 going in ;) Yummy... strawberry banana blueberry smoothie..."}
{"text":"I love me an açaí bowl and a good green juice. Nekter provides both, but not without difficulty...

I was there on Saturday around 11:00 am and ordered three large toxin flush juices and two açaí banana berry bowls. It took them at least 25 minutes to make the juices (I know that green juice can take a while, but 25 minutes?! Without a lot of others going on?), and when I got the açaí bowls, the staff member said, \"We're out of fresh blueberries and bananas. So this is all we have to top the bowls with.\" I'm sorry, but how does a juice bar run out of blueberries and bananas? At 11:00 am? And why not offer to substitute the lack of fruit with something else? No bueno for customer service."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Nékter Juice and I am a huge fan, but I found a sharp piece of plastic in the bottom of my drink today! I felt it in my mouth and immediately spit it out. Scary."}
{"text":"I am always looking for a good fresh juice place in town. This happens to be one of them.
Friendly staff and prices are best in town for fresh juices."}
{"text":"My friend and I rode our bikes over, it's in Downtown Summerlin. They offer juice mixes and the option to choose your own blend. Everything seemed fresh and tasted great! Seems clean. I don't know if it was organic. Also some premixed blends and protein blends. I tried the protein drink with almonds, vanilla, and cinnamon. Yummy and filling! It seemed expensive but it's so filling I wasn't concerned. It's a meal or two. I was bummed that they didn't have bike racks to lock our bikes.. What's up with that in a place like downtown Summerlin?"}
{"text":"Ehhh........honest opinion?.........Hyped up Jamba juice. Very cool looking place with all the fresh fruits and veggies behind the counter, very modern looking. The smoothies were just......ok. I thought very pricey, nothing dazzled me about the place."}
{"text":"So, I love the concept but super bummed the juices are made with mostly NON-ORGANIC fruits and vegetables:( What can we do to change this?!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is naturally popular because of the trendy health craze nowadays. But Nekter is right up there in my opinion! I come here for the acai bowls and theirs is definitely one of my favorites in the valley! It is a huge portion, great taste, just the right amount of sweet/tart and they are generous with the fruit & granola toppings. One bowl is good for 2 to share if having it for a healthy dessert which is what my bf and I usually do. When we are craving smoothies, this is also one of our go-to places. This is also where I tried my first pitaya bowl and it was excellent! More tart than the acai bowl but still sweet and filling. The location is nice and convenient, right in the heart of Ahwatukee. Parking is limited though being next to other restaurants. I have never been here during peak hours so I have never experienced a long wait for my order."}
{"text":"I have been to this location twice now and while the juice is great the service is horrible. Today I stood at the counter for five minutes before I was even acknowledged by anyone and when someone finally came out I asked them questions about the cleanse and got one word answers and she seemed very disinterested in helping me. Their aren't many choices for juice in the East Valley and I would like a more friendly experience when I walk in to this one."}
{"text":"Preparing to get beach fit ready I figured the best way to start is with a cleanse. To feel refreshed and brand new I chose Nekter to feed my body with the essential vitamins needed since I would be skipping toxic meals. What a better way to cleanse then with raw veggies and fruits. With the help of the super friendly staff I choose the 3 day detox which was on special for $99.00. The Classic Cleanse worked best for me as I am more of a fruity flavored person. The deliciousness of each pre-marked bottle that I sipped on throughout the day gave me a big boost of energy.  The cold pressed juices taste amazing. You even get a really cool bag to transport them from home to work. This gave me the opportunity to make sure I stayed hydrated. I am surprised that I did not feel hungry. If anything I felt full because it was suggested by the lady who rang me up to stay hydrated with water. So I incorporated at least 2 quarts of water throughout the day. 

The hip juice bar is located in colonnade mall. A chill atmosphere like Starbucks with plenty of seating and dining options. The whole crew enjoys what they do and are willing to help you. Since the juice bar offers more than juice this is the perfect health bar to hangout."}
{"text":"oh my goodness this place is so good! Delaney made our smoothies with such expertise our tastebuds danced to the fun and upbeat music... I wonder what station they listen too! Love love love love nektar! Can't wait to be back!!"}
{"text":"Good but soooo slow, Im always waiting a while for drinks so don't go if you want a quick drink"}
{"text":"I looove this place! So many great options for a healthy lifestyle! The new pineapple mint is so dang good! Thanks to the sweet girl named Lexi who helped me find my new favorite drink. I haven't seen good customer service skills like that in a long time! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Awesome acai bowls here they offer and very great variety of fresh fruit and vegetable smoothies! I wish they put a little less granola and more fruit or less acai and more fruit as they only put a few pieces of fruit in the bowl. Pretty pricey for the thing but I wouldn't mind paying it if it wasn't for half granola half acai and like 5 percent fruit. Not even a full banana! Only half of one and a few berries here and there. Disappointed for the price and such little fruit! Been here a few times and usually has a very rude girl behind the counter. Both at the register than makes the bowls or shakes as well. She gives off a super rude attitude and is very sarcastic. Not only to myself but to the guests Infront of me and behind my as well. Again not only one time but two times. Please put more fruit less granola please!"}
{"text":"Come here a lot on my lunch break.  Great service and super fast!  Always clean and friendly.  Great location with plenty of parking.  The best juice is my favorite!  Love how we can earn points in their app!"}
{"text":"Very cute litte shop right behind Chipotle. I has to call the store to find out the location. So I had to take a star off just because of the location.  The staff was very friendly. The store was clean and nice not sure if it was because it was new.
Just wish the cups was a little more durable for drinks 24oz or 32oz with ice."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the Toxin Flush! Totally delicious!

I used to work at a juice bar for a few years and applied at this place when they were about to open. No response, kinda weird... I couldn't even get a response when I attempted to follow up. but didn't affect me or this review. 

I expected the staff to be great, but it was meh. They sort of fumbled around with things I could tell they were new. 

I was on my way to work one day and wanted to call in an order to grab and go. I might as well make a smoothie at home for the time they take to make one here. But they don't have a phone number listed anywhere?? I tried siri and google with no luck. I was nervous to head in because I was unsure if they were even open. I just had siri connect me to Jamba Juice down the road and I easily called in my order there.

Good product, but won't be in unless they are quicker next time."}
{"text":"We were thirsty and looking for a healthy smoothie or something similar to drink. We were on our way to Macy's and walked passed Nekter! How exciting to see a healthy juice bar in Downtown Summerlin! 
They offer great selections of fresh juices and smoothies. We ordered a \"toxin flush\" that was full of parsley, spinach, apple, lemon, and ginger. This great green drink wasn't too sour and to my surprise it was perfectly balanced.  We also decided to share a \"tropical cooler\" which was made from a purée of spinach, kale, pineapple, banana, coconut butter, and coconut water.  We enjoyed our drinks outside on their patio and soaked up the sun, and relaxed by the water fountain.
The staff was extremely friendly and helped guide us through the menu. Prices were reasonable for the quality of ingredients used to make these drinks.  I will definitely be back soon to try their other drinks on the menu!"}
{"text":"Yummy juice bar.  A bit noisy since they have the back opened up so you can see what's going on but also hear everything too.   Takes a bit to crank out a smoothie which from a get-up and go societal perspective, is a bit long.  Clean, great service, and it's in a good location in Downtown Summerlin.

No clue on the cleanses since I don't do that stuff but from what I read, YMMV."}
{"text":"OMG they are as slow as can be. At least when i was there! Also beware u r not allergic to CASHEW milk. 1 of our kids got an allergic reaction to it and all i got her was a smoothie and she has always had other ingredients that were in the juice except cashew milk. Other than these they were excellent smoothies and açaí bowls."}
{"text":"Really like nektar, and I come here at least a few times a week with my wife, the staff are genuinely friendly and welcoming, especially to dogs, they always bring them water with our food:-) All the bowls I've had are delicious but my favorite is definitely the protein bowl, 45g of high quality protein( no soy) and their prices are super reasonable imo. Best way to start the day, or recover from a workout that I've found yet:-)"}
{"text":"I came in without knowing a lot about Nekter. Emily greeted me and immediately gave me a couple suggestions to try. I ordered her suggestion and it was great, Mango Delight with Greenie Up option. She also suggested I buy a gift card due to their special offer though the holidays. 

Overall, it was a great experience I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nektar is good is you are looking for a smoothie/juice. I love their acai bowls, although they are a little pricey."}
{"text":"Looking for something healthy after visiting the gym, and Nekter satisfies. 
The staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I am literally NEVER stepping foot in this place again. I have had several shitty experiences here and have even contacted the higher ups who gave me free this and that which is the ONLY reason I ever came back. Fast forward to a few months later when I think to myself, there's NO WAY they can mess up a simple juice order. Turns out they can. When I went in today, I was ecstatic because we got to the register and ordered right before a rush of like 15 people arrived. Can anyone take a wild guess as to whose order got left until the very end? Anyone? THIS BROWN GIRL RIGHT HERE. It's hard to not play the race card when you're in a room of about 30 white people and your simple juice order gets left until the very end. I finally got sick of waiting and asked to speak to the manager at which point the same nervous, flustered bearded man who took my order said, \"That would be me.\" When I asked who was above him, he told me I could call corporate if I wanted to. I wanted to. And I did. I left a lengthy, detailed message and made sure to let them know that NO, I don't want any more free this or that to make up for your extremely unprofessional, possibly racist service and establishment. If you're not white, stay away from this spot."}
{"text":"Yum! Greenie for me, Pink Flamingo for Em and an Acai bowl to share! Doing the liver detox! Em's pic attached!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always notice the use of my name in every interaction. I love using the Nékter app to make my order. It's extremely user-friendly and I've never had an issue with my order being incorrect! They are great and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came in Today in the morning due to doing a 7 day cleanse that has me only Drinking cold pressed juice on the 4th day (Today).  Go figure I sold my Breville Juicer a couple months ago. 

On my first visit today around 9am, I was greeted as I walked in from Daniel. He was supper nice and made some great suggestions on what to get.
Daniel also suggested to sign up for the Loyalty reward app. By doing so I was able to save $2 off my drink. 
Who doesn't want to save a buck or two. After buying 9 drinks your 10th drink is free!!

My second trip back @1pm Whitney was so nice and helpful as well with another great drink suggestions. Despite it being a lot busier this time Whitney was  patient with me. The way she interacted with all the customers showed that she really cared. Very uncommon to find great customer service no a days. 
Never thought that Beets drink would taste so good !!

My third trip today around 5pm I was greeted by Carmen who was very knowledgeable in questions that I had about their 1 day cleanse that they sell in the store. 
Carmen brought to my attention that on Oct 9th,  their 1 day cleanse was going to go on sale for $20 off. I will be back to buy it this coming Sunday. 

Overall I had such a good experience on all 3 times times that I visited today. It's nice to walk into a business and get GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE consistently no matter who's at the counter."}
{"text":"I felt like I was coming down with a cold so I decided to go to Nektar for a healthy drink plus I remembered that Nektar had sent me a email for a free birthday shot so the timing couldn't of not been better

I was greeted by Brianna and Carmen which where supper friendly. I saw that they had promotional Gift cards. 
It breaks down to for every $25 spent you get a Additional $5 gift card. Not bad deal since I come here anyways. 

I also saw that they had a 3 Day Cleanse on sale for $99 normally it would be around $130-$140. It was a good deal. I decided to buy the 3 Day Cleanse because I was feeling not like my normal self from the last 2 weeks , especially with all the delicious food around for the Holidays, it's a little hard to not give in a little or a lot. 

The staff working here are friendly and easy to ask questions on for advice on what to order. 
FYI - their bowls are Really gooooood.....

Overall the staff has provided me with a great customer service experience every time I visit and not to mention a good tasting healthily product."}
{"text":"This place offers multiple different acai bowl, smoothies and juices. 

I ordered the mango acai bowl that had acai blended with other fruits then topped with shredded coconuts, banana, granola and added $1 topping of bee pollen. 

I never had acai blended with other fruits as I am used to the dark purple acai sambazon that I would blend with almond milk and ice then top if with other fruits. 

Being from Hawaii, the bee pollen has a taste and I didn't taste bee pollen; it tasted like a dry crunchy bee pollen that should enhance the acai bowl. I know they use agave nectar but it'll be nice to have agave or honey on top of the fruits of the acai bowl. 

I don't think I like acai mixed with other fruits and I might be biased because for a decade of so I use acai blended with ice and milk (almond or soy) then topped with fruits. 

I tried my friends' peanut acai bowl and that was really good to taste the peanut butter mixed with acai - highly recommend this acai bowl. 

The lowest review is the wait-time for your acai bowl, smoothie or juice as the wait could be close to 5 minutes or so. 

They have comfy chairs with cushioned seats with wooden back and pillows. There were only 3 seated areas with those comfy cushioned seats. 

I would go back to try the other drinks."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting to try one of their açai bowls. It was certainly enjoyable and worth the price compared to other places I've been. The ingredients were very fresh and used in good proportions.  I expect that I'll go back again in the future."}
{"text":"I ordered a peanut butter açai bowl and it was delicious and refreshing. The staff was also friendly."}
{"text":"They take forever to get your juice ready. The taste is great but pricey and super slow."}

{"text":"My Jack Lalanne juicer that I stole from my parents in 2003 finally broke :(  and instead of investing in a new one, I'm blowing all my money on the high mark up fresh juice at various valley juice bars. Probably not smart, but it is fun to enjoy the drink without the major cleanup!

I am a fan of Nektar juice bar. I have been here a couple times to get fresh juice and one time I got crazy and purchased their one-day cleanse pack. My first drink, \"The glow\" consisted of carrots, parsley, kale, spinach, celery, lemon and ginger. From my own juicing experience, I knew carrots would make the drink on the sweeter side without the high amounts of sugar from fruit and thus my first obvious drink of choice. I wasn't wrong, this refreshing drink is always on my mind when I walk into Nektar, but I wanted to try their Toxin Flush (parsley, spinach, apples, lemon, and ginger) on my second visit so that's what I did, and it was on the bitter side even with the apples so I'm not sure if I would order this one again unless I was partaking in a juice fast which leads me into my one-day clean pack. This pack comes pre-assembled with six juices either from the Advanced Cleanse menu or the Classic Cleanse Menu with the major difference being more veggies and less fruit in the Advanced, which was what I opted for. These one packs cost are around $50 + (after tax), but when I walked into this store that were have a Flash sale which essentially saved me $10 of retail so I went for it.  You get about 990 calories out of the six drinks which consists of two \"green\" drinks, two lemonades (one with just ginger and lemon, the other with cayenne added), one beet drink, and the last drink is the yummiest which is made up of raw cashew milk! All the cleanse packs come in a cute little cooler and other cleanse packs include a two day, three day, and five day, but I can't afford those! 

You can also buy single bottled juice drinks in their refrigerator for about $8 and sometimes those are marked 50% off depending on expiration date.In addition to fresh or bottles juice, you can also purchase smoothies, wheat grass or ginger shots, and food (well, acai bowls or pitaya bowls and some prepackaged organic snacks in the refrigerator). The staff have always been very friendly, polite, and helpful with the questions that I ask, even when there is a line.

I will be back because I really, really want to try their Date Nut smoothie because I love Dateland's date milkshake, but don't want to drive that far. Instead of ice cream Nektar's Date Smoothie is made of cashew nut milk and a banana which I think will blow Dateland's shake out of the water!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Nekter out of all the ones I've been to. It's my home base and the employees see me so often they call me by name and usually know my order. Kayla has always made me feel very welcome, she always gives me a good feeling and makes me want to keep coming back."}
{"text":"I get they make the drinks fresh but service was super slow and there was only one person in front of me and two behind me. Not sure if one of the employees was new which I can understand. Took about 15 minutes before I got my drink. I got the Dragon Berry and it was pretty good. I think I like the pink flamingo better but wanted to try something different"}
{"text":"Charcoal Lemonade is so delicious! (Insert several fire emojis here)"}
{"text":"I LOVED the Nekter in Orange County! I always would go there after a workout! The one here....100% still needs some work...the juices and smoothies seem great but their acai bowls are terrible compared to california nekter granola is not very good find ice chunks in the bowl...not enough toppings ever...still needs some work.."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick breakfast on the go, or after a morning workout. My smoothie was called the pink flamingo. Only about 270 calories."}
{"text":"Walked into this plsce felt very cozy. The staff was very knowledgeable of products and what's good to eat. They offer a Cleanse where all u do is drink the six bottles throughout the day, and u don't eat. U can have raw almonds. The one thing I noticed about the ingredients was they are fresh fruits and veggies. (Kale, ginger, spinach, coconut) etc. ......  for the six bottles of the Cleanse it's 48 dollars."}
{"text":"Super high expectations of Acai Bowls. I'm such a Acai bowl snobb and this place was Amazing. 

It was my boyfriends first time he loved it he is hooked and he is going to be a regular customer. 

The amounts where enough for me and him to share and he eats a lot so that shows they give a generous amount. Granola was nice and crunchy not stale like some places. The agave (whatever brand they use) was No tasty not To sweet or bitter and they did not Over load my Bowl. Very professional staff. Very patient, especially cause it was my first time there and I didn't have my glasses to see anything, they helped me out a lot and they weren't mean to me. 

This place is the ONLY place we will be getting Acai Bowls. I hope they do Card promotions like after u get 10 u can get a free one or something like that I'd love to share it with my co-workers .. there were cozy seatings and very cute spot to go a dye with a health freak."}
{"text":"Went two days ago, waited over 15 min for one bowl. No one cared or said anything.
Went today and ordered three bowls. The lady taking orders was so rude and it's just not worth this lack of service.
I would say, stay away, give your money to a place that appreciates your business."}
{"text":"Pink Flamingo! Delicious & amazed by the kcal vs. flavor. I was expecting a lot more calories for the deliciousness!!!!  Deducting 1 tar for cleanliness. Their other locations have this location beat in that area (in their defense it was empty boxes that  needed breaking down & they were very busy! But still have to be honest!). But all things considered,  the product & service was consistent is equal."}
{"text":"I seriously love this place! It's kind of funny to walk in and see baskets of fake fruit for decoration because everything is so fresh and delicious, but who cares. 

I always order the Acaí Banana Berry Bowl, which is seriously the most delicious thing ever! The wait time can be a little longer than other traditional smoothie bars, but in my opinion you're getting a higher quality product so it's totally worth it. 

Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Love their juices and Acai bowls. So good - my daughter and I are addicted. The juice cleanse packs are also good and super easy."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing! I went here this weekend when I was in Downtown Summerlin shopping. I was feeling a bit under the weather so I wanted a drink that has ginger in it. I tried the \"Toxin Flush\" asked for extra ginger. Man, it was the best tasting juice I've had! It was green so at first I thought it would taste bitter somehow, but when I took my first sip, I was in love! It was refreshingly good and the taste was very mild. I can drink that thing all day, every day!  

I cannot wait to come back here and try their Acai bowls! I saw that they have different kinds here and I will have to try them all!"}
{"text":"Great experience & seems the kinks have been worked out! The greenie PB acai bowl is to die for!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite valley location as the team is nothing short of outstanding. Friendly & hardworking employees- manager Priscilla is fantastic. The app makes ordering a breeze & the loyalty program is a great perk. Great acai bowls & juices - love the Greenie & the Pirates bowls."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here so we could catch up, around 10am. The interior was unique and slightly rustic. It would have been nice to see real food in their display baskets but I'm sure it's a pain to keep clean. It's small inside but there are a few tables and chairs. Their menu is posted on the wall so you can ask questions about certain things. If you want to get your fill of veggies and or fruit for the day in a drink, this is your place. I ordered a small Toxic Flush. I was pleasantly surprised that the taste was quite nice. I guess parsley does not like me as I felt the parley all day. I will remember for next time to ask for light parsley. I did go on an empty stomach and it did keep me satisfied until dinner. I saw the offer full day flushes and found those to be something I could be interested in the future.  All and all, I will be back to explore more of this unique place"}
{"text":"I am on vacation here in Phoenix and I was so happy when I came across Nekter. I'm from Texas and eating well is important for me, I looked on trip advisor before vacation and was disappointed when it didn't show there was a Nekter here, but there is one! Hooray!
The toxin flush is my go to green drink. I love to get a juice when I'm feeling tired or my nutrition has been off.
Nekter always has the friendliest customer service too. Its a great place to meet a friend and share an acai bowl too!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today because I was craving an acai bowl. They were pretty busy, but I didn't end up waiting too long. About 4 bites into my bowl I found a short black hair in it, my hair is not black by the way. But I've worked in food industry, I simply pulled it out and kept going. As I got further in I found a few chunks of acai that hadn't been blended in all the way and that was kind of frustrating. 
Overall, not too pleased."}
{"text":"If you want a juice this place is great. Only real problem here is that it is expensive. I have tried quite a few of the drinks. All good."}
{"text":"I so want to give this place 4 or 5 stars but I have to be an authentic Yelper. Mr./Ms. Manager, I'm a regular there as you can see by the amount of check-ins that I have. I've been in there multiple times and there has been issues maybe about 25% of the time that I've been in. One time the register wasn't working so the young clerk didn't sell the 24oz'ers because he hadn't memorized the price including tax. I know you have a quality gig goin on here, but when you hire kids only to run this type of establishment without a real grown up on board to manage it, the appeal or quality plummets. Arcadia is the perff spot for your business, but the \"slowness\" and the quality of service is going to turn people off. If I'm spending $80 on a cleanse program, I want a qualified, knowledgeable employee to answer my questions. Also, if I'm trying to get my day started on a healthy note, I still don't want to spend too much time waiting for a juice or bowl. Lastly, the ad on Yelp to get a discount was finally taken off because they didn't know how to discount it on the register...and also had discrepancies with discounts in regards to the Nekter cup that I had purchased. Consistency and education for your team is some food for thought that I'd like to offer please, so EVERYONE 's on board with the same answer."}
{"text":"Came right when they were closing but they took care of me anyway, super friendly staff & didn't have to wait long at all for my smoothie, will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Really good despite some unlikely ingredients..plus the good made great recommendations.."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and found this place. Every time I go a young lady helps me ( Lexi ) I almost feel like we've know each other for years.The TOXIN FLUSH and TROPICAL COOLER are outstanding. I always look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Normally I'm not one to do these kinds of reviews, but today my experience here was less than subpar. Working in a food and beverage place myself, I get it. I get how much it sucks. But finding a large chunk of frozen acai (? Ice cube??) in my bowl was just plain laziness. How do you even miss something that big unless you don't care? My friends also found chunks in their bowls too. The customer service when I came in made me feel very unwelcome, which I can brush off, but transferring it to the quality of your drinks and food is unacceptable. Bye nektar."}
{"text":"Picture this: 85 degrees out and you just wrapped a yoga class and all you want is a nice refreshing acai bowl. This location is one of the few places in my area (according to yelp) that has acai bowls... Unfortunately they're not done like a true bowl. I ordered the PB bowl and instead of the base mixture being icy and slush like it was thicker, almost like a smoothie. Don't get me wrong it was DELICIOUS but it's just not a true acai bowl unfortunately. Let the hunt continue for my go to juice shop that has it all."}
{"text":"I am so glad this place opened! I saw it on the way to my nail shop and decided to stop in. They have a pretty nice sized menu of juice and smoothies. They also have a small selection of bottled juice and nutritious snacks. Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Place was spaced, nicely decorated, but it was hot in there. Could've let the door stay open at least since its winter time. 

It was quiet cuz there was pretty much one person, or no one. Lol. 

The pink flamingo was good, but i forgot what i had. The taste was ok. I wasnt too impressed. I guess im comparing it to jamba juice and boba. Lol. I can say its good for a healthy drink? It was alright, im curious to try different flavors in the future.

The cashiers were ok, they seemed off key like they wanted to just get back to cutting fruits and veggies. Lol. 

I gave three stars, cuz it was aight."}
{"text":"Very great healthy juice and smoothie options. The prices are high but still worth a trip about once per week. Need to have more specials or \"juice of the day\" that's less expensive."}
{"text":"Nekter always has the best employees, and the best items! There is a nekter a little closer to my house then this one, but I come here because although the employees are great at all locations, this location nails it! They make me feel important here! They are all amazing but Brandy is exceptional! I enjoy driving the extra mile because of the employees! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"What a great addition to our neighborhood! The service is always quick and friendly. Try the green juices (especially the toxin flush) and if you need a cleanse they have you covered. Not such a fan of the protein shake to go (it's chalky). Bowls are yummy too- my whole family eats them."}
{"text":"Good service, healthy options and tasty treats.  We like to share the acai bowls.  Mmmm."}
{"text":"Perfect cool treat that's a healthier choice.  Consistently good and nice staff.  They usually remember my order and name."}
{"text":"Extremely expensive but extremely delicious. They are trying for the modern minimalistic look but it looks \"cold\" instead. Still a nice treat once in a while."}
{"text":"Fastest nektar I have ever been to. The staff was super friendly, responsive, and up to date on the current specials."}
{"text":"Love this location. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Clean and tidy inside is a solid plus. Always the best selection of drinks."}
{"text":"First time to Nektar and have to say, the customer service is beyond great and the food is amazing. It just smelled amazing walking into the shop. An absolute must if you've never been."}
{"text":"Nektar was good! I was recommended to try this out with my best friend! Been procrastinating this visit but after a good workout leaving Lifetime fitness we defended to head over and see what the hype was about? Usually i don't do these kind of places because I hate paying $10 or more for a drink that's not an alcoholic beverage hehe but in the world of trying to stay fit and healthy that's the normal kind of prices to get these raw juices and etc. They offer a variety of different drinks from the smoothies to the juices. I will definitely have to come back and get one of these yogurt bowls they look pretty tasty but after a drink and a yogurt you are gonna be close to $20! That's fair I guess compared to the other kind of places that have this whole juicing theory!"}
{"text":"Like very many modern smoothie shops, Nekter Juice Bar provides a great atmosphere that is enhanced by their flavorful fruit smoothies, juices, bowls, and scoops. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. You can pick you own blend for less than five dollats. And they juice it fresh. No wonder the line is longer than chipolte. One of my favorite joints of all time."}
{"text":"Great fresh Juice and Breakfast options, a little pricey but what fresh food place isn't. A must try!"}
{"text":"First ever experience where they read your mind.  We were waiting for a table at the breakfast restaurant next-door \"Snooze.\" They said it would be a 25 minute wait, so we walked into the Nekter and ordered some juice while at the same time the table became available. They immediately offered to bring the juice over to our table at the OTHER RESTAURANT! Which they did with a smile! Y'all are the best!!!"}
{"text":"This place is super hip. I got the acai bowl with all the works. It's amazing! Felt super healthy. It's great fresh, I wouldn't recommended saving it for later but must be eaten right away!"}
{"text":"I tried out Nekter Juice Bar at my daughter's urging and had a great experience. I actually went here twice on two consecutive days and ordered the Berry Acai bowl both days.  It was filled to the brim of the bowl with acai, fruit, and granola. The bowl is over $8 but is quite filling and so it seems worth it for a healthy, fresh option.

The staff were super helpful and even offered to make an off-the-menu juice that I requested. There was a good mix of people eating in as well as taking their orders to go.  They also have pre-packaged juices that I am looking forward to trying out."}
{"text":"Nekter supports the military! I stopped by after a workout and ordered a 16oz Green Apple Detox with whey and kale which was actually very good. It was sweet with zero bitterness. The lady at the counter said that will be $1.08. All I had to pay for was the whey. Military gets a free 16oz juice and I think smoothie for Veterans Day. That's an incredible discount and I incredibly appreciate it. I will be a repeat customer. Thank you for your military support."}
{"text":"If I could I would give them a 3.5, they do have great juices and smoothies, but they are not organic and they do not change their flavors up very much.

Juice cleanses are okay, need more flavors to have it compete with others on the market.

So glad they opened an app, this way you can order ahead of time and not wait in line (as much)."}
{"text":"You can find a Nekter near you in many areas of Phoenix and southern California these days. It is a good choice if you're looking for an acai bowl, smoothie or juice.  This location is great and located in the Hilton Village shopping center.  I had the peanut butter acai bowl here recently and substituted in coconut water for the cashew milk ... it was delish!  I only have 2 small complaints/suggestions for Nekter in general.  1 - offer 2 sizes for your acai bowls.  The one size is quite large and pretty much no one needs that many carbs in one sitting. 2 - Offer a milk alternate for those with nut allergies.  Other than that, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. My daughter and I couldn't get enough of these during our visit to Arizona. We don't have one of these places in our area in California. We had the orange crush and it tastes so much healthier than Jamba Juice. Super friendly staff and store is very clean."}
{"text":"My first Açaí Bowl ever, and it was amazing.  Mine had peanut butter and dates along with strawberries and banana with granola.  Filling and tasty.  Would definitely return here again."}
{"text":"You can only go right with Nekter Juice Bar. 

I love all their smoothies and this location is clean with excellent service! :)

Just tried Chocolate Dream for the first time and of course, loved it!"}
{"text":"Amazing açaí bowls and shakes. They filled my shake to the brim :) and their açaí peanut bowl (substitute almond butter) was amazing! And they don't skimp on toppings which is refreshing. I love this place and always swing by and grab a bowl when I'm in town on business. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Everything is ridiculously delicious! The atmosphere is wonderful (just not around lunch time, it's crazy busy)! The entire room smells so fresh & clean, I love that I can see the fruit they use. It's a really great place. My 4yr old loves the chocolate dream smoothie! And it has avacado in it! It's so delicious! The bowls are so yummy & filling! You truly cannot pick something bad on their menu."}
{"text":"I tried the pitaya bowl with bee pollen added for extra energy.  It was a nice and tasty treat.  pitaya is supposed to reduce cholesterol, lower blood pressure according to the literature.  I feel relaxed after eating it.

Definitely will come back again when I am in the mood for a healthy sweet treat."}
{"text":"I love nekter juice! I go to several of their locations and my favorite is the pink flamingo smoothie. It's bright fushia and has a sweet unique flavor-not your typical strawberry/banana or mango/pineapple.....I also used to love the \"date nut\" which tasted like spices and dates, but they took it off the menu. Oh well I can still get my date fix at Juby True"}
{"text":"I'm not a big smoothie/juice bar visitor, but after visiting Nekter, I might start frequenting juice bars more often! I enjoyed an acai bowl and it was the perfect blend of refreshing and full of nutrients. It was filled with fresh fruit and oatmeal in the form of a frozen smoothie bowl. They have plenty of juices and acai bowls to choose from and you can also order shots of wheat grass, etc. Whether your a newbie or a juicing regular, this is definitely a good option."}
{"text":"This location is very nice. Parking is scarce around lunchtime. Expect to pay 10$ for a smoothie (8.83 plus they force you to tip by putting the line on the receipt.I hate places that do this). Healthy ingredients. They have bowls which are kind of unique and are worth a try. They also have little protein snacks and chia parfaits."}
{"text":"Just came in for the first time and ordered a 32oz Greenie. It was a great juice. Definitely will go back to try an Acai bowl soon. They look very tasty. I have been looking for a good juice bar around the Mesa area. Will definitely to go back to try other fresh juices."}
{"text":"never been here before, so I stopped by after lunch for a smoothie and it was amazing. the girl on the register helped me out after I told her I have never been here before. if you like a good, all natural smoothie or juice, hit this place up. super delicious!"}
{"text":"There is just something about this location. The service sucks. The product is fine but the employees just bring you down. I more frequently visit the location on McDonald and I guess I have just been spoiled by the friendly upbeat staff there. Friday 12/26 I was picking up a couple of bowls for breakfast and I came in and the staff was busy juicing and making bowls with a few customers waiting. I walk up, patiently waiting looking over the menu, I'm in a great mood and having a great morning so far until the gal with the shaved sides, who took my order walked up. She walked up and I said \"hi!\" She gave me a dirty look and rudely responded with what did you say? I said.. I just said hi.. She says, \"oh I though you said something.\" Uh ya, I was saying hi. It was uncomfortable and it put me off right away. I then proceeded to inconvenience her by giving her my order, 2 bowls off the menu and one juice. I legit felt uncomfortable ordering from her she was so rude. She did not tell me my total I read it off the register myself and she took my money, gave me my change and turned around and walked away. No thank you, it'll be right out, not a smile, nothing. I almost said, you know what.. Forget it. I wanted to be done with her attitude and it really put a damper on me for a minute. Like how can she be so rude and the one taking the orders? I was waiting for my order and noticed a sign about the punch cards are remembered I had one. She never brought that up at the register and at this point I didn't want to talk to her again so I left punchless. Every time I've been here the employees have been less than friendly. Looks like I'll stick to the McDonald location."}
{"text":"Juices are fresh and taste great. Staff isn't so friendly unless you look like someone with a lot of money. I'm bummed they weren't as great as I thought they'd be as I would have returned every morning to get those juices."}
{"text":"Came in with a friend as we were craving smoothies and this place looked good. Probably never coming back. We walked in at 4:10 PM and just got both our drinks at 4:45 PM. My friend needed to leave by 4:25 to get to a lesson she was teaching. She and two other people that ordered after me got their smoothies before me. There were 3-4 people working, and they all kept messing up everyone's orders. One guy said he'd been waiting for 30 minutes. I'd had enough and finally flipped out on one of the workers demanding where my drink was, in which he said he was training the other 2-3 workers. That's ridiculous. You're training 2-3 people at once? My friend had to cancel her lesson, and my drink wasn't very good after all that. This business made my friend lose her money from her work and made me lose my patience. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Smoothie has a very strange consistency. Felt slimy going down, I threw mine away, could not finish it."}
{"text":"Love this Location! The workers are great and work fast!! I strongly suggest! I love Tempe marketplace in general and come here often and whenever I'm here I stop in to get a healthy fresh juice"}
{"text":"For any reason at all, this place is always a good idea.

Friendly staff. Everything is fresh & made to order. Plus, you walk away entirely guilt free!!! Lol

I had the green apple detox & it was delicious. I got the small size & my cousin got the medium for only a little bit more than what I paid for. I immediately regretted not paying the little extra to get a MUCH bigger size. The cup sizes displayed don't look too different in size, but when you're actually holding the cup, the medium size is actually much bigger than the small

Overall, this is a MUST try juicery in the area & I will definitely come back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Super frustrating to get to Nektar with 6 minutes before they close to have the doors locked. It's 5:54 on my iPhone. 
Way to cut corners! 
Wait time is longer than most juice places. Only continue to go because it's so close to my house or they would completely lose my business..... And my family eats acai bowls at least 3x per week."}
{"text":"The Toxin flush was what I tried, by recommendation of an employee and it was good! Place is clean & the worker bees are friendly. I will definitely be back to try The Glow and other things."}
{"text":"Wowee. I sure love this place, but to be honest, the best part about nékter is their book \"Sneaky Spinach.\" While it is a children's book on the surface, it touches the deepest parts of the soul when talking about the benefits of eating healthy. Definitely a 5/5 for nékter, but a strong 6/5 for the book \"Sneaky Spinach.\" Shoutout to my home girl Alexis Schulze for the empowering read."}
{"text":"Great location. Their Acai bowls are awesome and the juices that I have had have all been really good as well. The only thing that was just okay for me was the mango smoothie. Didn't really have that much flavor and wasn't very sweet. Other then that, this is a great place to get some nutritional foods and the prices are very reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Love this place! I could eat the AÇAÍ BANANA BERRY BOWL everyday. Make sure to add almond butter or peanut better. Also ask to have your bowl topped off with cacao nibs. It will leave you smiling!"}
{"text":"I have only been once but had a pleasant experience.  The staff was nice,, the facility
was pleasant, the options good , the wait time a little long but worth it because the drinks great!   we got 2 and each better than the other.  Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Healthy start to your day ! Great stuff 
Wish they had one where I live in NorCal ... 
  Was so addicted that came in few days in a row .. The staff is real nice too ."}
{"text":"Fresh pressed juices, smoothies & acai bowls. They have an assortment of health food snacks like coconut chips & sweet potato chips. They've started carrying soups but aren't available warm in store rather bottled for take home & heat use."}
{"text":"I love nektar but after today, I don't think I'll be back. I came in with my boyfriend and we both ordered acai bowls. It wasn't terribly busy, but there was a small rush of people who came in after us. A lady that came in 2 or 3 people AFTER we did got her bowl before us, but I didnt think much of it since my boyfriend got his bowl right after. But then they kept calling out orders that weren't mine and after sitting there and waiting for nearly 30 minutes, I was very annoyed. My boyfriend went up to ask them what was going on and all they said was \"sorry, we'll make it now...sorry\"... they made it and called it out, and another lady who also ordered the same bowl and I walked up and took it. I could hear the cashier tell the girls that they had just given away my bowl, which I should have gotten a while ago. They finally made it and the place was nearly empty. Almost 15 people that came in after me got their order before I finally got mine and I didn't even  get an apology for the wait. Will not be returning.."}
{"text":"I love Nékter but your customer service is garbage. Twice in two weeks I've driven 20 minutes to your location and have been told that you didn't have the items to make my order. I give you my contact info through the app, why can't I be contacted when you can't execute my order? 

(This also happened at the chandler location last week which brings the grand total to three orders in two weeks that I was not able to pick up. I'll give a separate review of chandler's store but these are the facts.)

Your location is in no way convenient but I love the products you sell so I'm willing to put up with the journey. Get your act together and improve your customer service. Contact a customer when you realize you can't fulfill their order, pretty basic logic for your industry. I'm not trying to be \"that\" customer but the frequency of this issue is a cause for concern."}
{"text":"I always come here to get my favorite pink flamingo. The burst of flavor is great for any warm day."}
{"text":"Refreshing always, especially the smell when you come in the door. 
 I do wish the bowl came in a smaller size as I love It but cannot finish a whole one so if I am not going home to save it I cant have one.
My favorites are the juices and bowls."}
{"text":"My newest addiction! Nekter is my favorite place to stop for breakfast or lunch! Although I haven't found a juice that I love, I can honestly say their banana berry bowl is the best thing I've eaten. With bananas, strawberrys, blueberries, and granola,  their ginormous acai bowl has me full for hours. Not only does it taste good, when I take it to go, heads turn. One morning I was stopped 4 different times to ask what that delightful treat in my hand was! If you want to try something fresh, delicious, and healthy come to Nektar, you'll be happy you did!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting since my  friend had a coupon for a buy one get one free& so we walk in were just standing away from the counter deciding what to get. The guy asks \" are you guys ready?\" We said not yet and after that it was complete silence , no suggestions on what to get but the guy was staring at us the whole time..

i got the pink flamingo & it had flavors of Pitaya , strawberry, agave nectar& coconut juice but when I tasted it was really bitter. It did not taste how it looked or how it was described. The guy was nice enough to pour more agave nectar in but personally just that experience alone got me double thinking not to come back& stick to my jamba juice or other smoothie/ juice places.."}
{"text":"Felt like having something quick and healthy on a lunch break so decided to go to Nekter.

They offer a wide variety of healthy smoothies, açaí bowls and juices that are very healthy and taste great for a reasonable price!

This location is in the heart of Downtown Summerlin in the Promenade next to Macy's, great location to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.

A 5 Star would have been easy if just reviewing the food/location. But the service ruined this trip for us.

Walked in to an almost empty room and no one behind the register. After a few minutes a young girl came out from the back it got a little worse. No hello, no welcome, no smile, just a robotic \"what can I get you\" in the most I Don't Want To Be Here attitude. She quickly takes the order and disappears. We felt I welcomed there and left as soon as we got our food."}
{"text":"I love this place the staff is always friendly. The only issue I see that will be them being understaffed during peak times like Saturday morning! No matter how good the product or how nice the staff , efficiency is important and that falls on management. Properly staff your restaurant or people will go somewhere else if they have to wait more than 20 mins for juice ! Juice shops are a dime a dozen , it's not that hard to go down the street and find another ! Either properly staff or pay your staff enough so they actually show up to work and show a sense of urgency! Remember you have Starbucks next door who could have double the amount of people in line and do it quicker ! I understand it costs a lot of money and if you can't afford to hire then I suggest you as an owner get in there and help !!!!"}
{"text":"I love juices! Addicted to them! I tried to be apart of their reward system, but it never worked. No worries, still love it here! Love the girls at this location! All sweet friendly girls! I like all the green juices the best! More on the toxin, cleansing side and the girls always make sure I love my juice before I leave! If I'm in the mood for something \"fun\" I always get the pink flamingo! Mmm! So good! I usually stick wifi my greens tho  hard to pass up! This location is particularly friendly, but I love all nekters I've been to! All great employees!:)"}
{"text":"Very friendly and excellent customer service. Juices and smoothies are so fresh. I prefer the flavor over comparable drinks at other juice bars."}
{"text":"I love this place I love the bowls and I love the staff I strongly recommend. The staff was lovely and the place was really clean. The service was also efficient and the hooked me up with a coupon they are lovely!"}
{"text":"Following up on the previous review where there was a hair in my food. Nekter made me the entire order again, at no charge."}
{"text":"It is so tempting to go here because there are not too many choices for fresh presses juices. Their juices are fresh pressed, however, I would only go if I have a good 20-30 minutes to wait for a juice.  The staff spends too much time chatting with each other with. I sense of urgency to do their jobs. Service is soooooooo bad."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Nektar since they first started opening up, and I got the chance to go last week. This location was smaller than I had expected! I had always driven past the one at Scottsdale Ed and greenway Hayden loop, and that one had seemed a little bit bigger.
I met someone there at 8am on a Friday, and there was only like one or two other people that came through there. I ordered a small juice, I can't remember what it was called, but it had carrot, orange, ginger, and I think one more ingredient. I was uncertain because I had ordered a juice similar to this from another juice bar and hadn't liked it. But this one was really good I thought! You could taste all of the ingredients, but none of them were too overpowering which I really liked. 
Prices weren't to terrible either. I think my drink was about $5, which isn't too bad. Some places if you want a fresh juice it costs like $10, so I thought this was reasonable. I have got to come back for a smoothie or acai bowl for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to a different Nektar before, but I think this one was nicer! Super clean, a little small but still pretty good seating. The staff was great too, helpful to us when we were deciding what to order. 
I had never had a acai bowl from Nektar, so j got one of those! I can't remember which one, but I paid extra to have kale and spinach added to it, and I'm glad I did. My sister got the same one as me without greens. We both loved our acai bowls and ate the whole thing pretty quickly! My mom got some kind of chocolate carob smoothie, and we all thought it would be awesome but I did not like it. To me and my sister it just kind of tasted like almond butter in liquid form. My mom said it tasted better as she got used to it though! I loved Nektar, glad to have a location nearby now, can't wait to come back and try more stuff!"}
{"text":"\"Always whole authentic and fresh!\" Says their cups but it's so true you guys!  The team is on point with great personable customer service, big smiles, and warm hearts. Check in offer is a FREE ginger shot for a good energy and immunity boost! Thanks for recommending the \"health but\" smoothie! So yummy! And housemate cashew milk?! What's not to love here??"}
{"text":"Be going here for a while. What a great acai bowl!!!  Nice staff, easy parking and always clean"}
{"text":"Juices & Smoothies are always delicious. 

I come in a 3-4 times a week between 10:00-12:00 and the early crew is always quick & very friendly. They give the best drink recommendations if you don't know what you want."}
{"text":"Came in here to grab a smoothie and Acai bowl before shopping. I have always heard amazing things about Nekter and I was very excited to try it out.

My first time being here I asked the cashier (remind you i was the only person inside the place) what his favorite thing was on the menu. He told me he didnt eat there. Ummm ok interesting? Then i asked the girl cashier who was standing there staring at me what her favorite thing was and she said \"i don't know, i guess everything\" Ummmm ok. haha So i asked if any of the Acai bowls could be made without Nuts because I am severely allergic. She said \"No\" and walked away.
I looked at the guy and he just shrugged. So I opted for a Smoothie. I asked him several times to please not put nuts in it for it had called for i believe cashew milk or almond milk and he said they couldn't substitute...

Now with my extensive background and knowledge in the restaurant industry I was pretty taken back by this. I really didn't understand why he couldn't just sub coconut water, soy milk, or even just tap water for the other. Then I asked to build my own Smoothie and they said There were probably nuts in all the smoothie blenders.

I was very unhappy to hear this. I will just stick to juicing and blending at home before going to DT Summerlin."}
{"text":"This is extremely unfortunate. Came in on Christmas Eve to grab a smoothie and a few wellness shots before work. I ordered via their app (they don't take phone orders anymore) and after 40 minutes I headed over. 
There were two girls sitting in the back on their phones. The hadn't started my order yet so I waited. Then they informed me one of the shots they didn't have. I said OK I'll just take the ginger. She handed me a shot which was supposed to be ginger and it was pure apple juice. 
When I told her that she remade it. But still made it wrong. Rediculous. 
When I tried my smoothie I immediately had an allergic reaction. I am severely allergic to Nuts and my throat closes. I told the girls numerous times of my severe allergy and they truly didn't care. 
When I called to tell a manager no one was available so I called the other location (in downtown summerlin)  I spoke with a manager there and she said her GM would call me back that night. 
Fast forward 3 days later and no word. I called the shop and the head the GM call me back. He pretty much said they can't accommodate people with allergies and can't guarantee safety. I sure wish I would have been told this prior. 
Nekter, you are losing a customer the spends on average $10-$15 a day there. It's a shame of the lack of customer service I have experienced. I will never return."}
{"text":"Nekter is my go to when I want to feel good! Love the tempe location! They're quick and friendly every time"}
{"text":"They do not use organic ingredients, but I think that's why they don't charge as much as competitors in the area. Their acai bowls are delicious. I won't be returning, though, because they have frequently messed up my order and also given it to a customer after me (they are disorganized) and offered nothing in compensation. Not even an apology. Kaleidoscope Juice FTW."}
{"text":"Service - quick, friendly, and relaxed! 

Environment - clean and trendy but totally welcoming! 

Product - YYUUUUMMMM!! The Sublime is my happy place."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Maybe because I came right before closing? While the staff was friendly and helpful. The acai bowl I had was just tasteless. How is that even possible?? The fresh fruit was fine but the actual acai blend tasted like nothing. I ordered the acai banana bowl at suggestion from the cashier."}
{"text":"Yum yum Acai bowl... On this particular day, I came to try Pitaya bowl. Dragonfruit at the bottom (pink one you see on the picture). 

Who doesn't like Nekter Juice Bar? I try to eat lots of veggies and fruits but I can't always eat as much as recommend. Nekter Juice Bar is a perfect solution for a day I feel like I not eating enough fruits and vegetables.

If It's during lunch hour, I order acai bowl, it's quite filling and feel good when I finished eating.

This particular location has a friendly staff and she takes time and answers any questions you may have. She doesn't rush you and her knowledge is helpful to decide what to eat/drink.

I would definitely stop by here again for more healthy and yummy drink next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Plain and simple...this place is amazing. My coworkers and I stumbled  upon this little gem one day after having lunch at the place next door. We now go there at least two times a week just for the PB Bowl. It's the most amazing vegan dessert/smoothie/whatever. We have all admitted thinking about it over the weekend, and head there first thing Monday for lunch. 

It's a great place. Don't skip it."}
{"text":"Nice staff, same great açaí banana berry bowl. Even got a little extra granola at no charge!"}
{"text":"If it were possible to leave 0 stars I would. Coincidentally the last time I was here the service was beyond poor it prompted me to leave a review which I don't typically do, but decided to give them a second chance. Fast forward 2 months later and sadly nothing has improved. We placed an order 35 minutes in advance knowing their service is substantially slower than most. I arrived 45 minutes later and it took 3 people to search the back and could not find the 2 bowls that were ordered. I then replaced my order and waited an additional 15 minutes which isn't bad compared to the 25 minutes we waited last time. Even midway of preparing it they realized they were making a smoothie, not a bowl... It was Father's Day and our time is limited so for them to not make this process any easier, we will take our business elsewhere. It's disappointing because I really do like Nektar's product but this particular location is not a mere reflection of their company."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped to get a beverage while we were walking around TMP. He got the berry banana smoothie - nothing special, what I make at home is better. I got \"the buzz\" juice - carrot, orange, lemon, and ginger - pretty good, but not worth paying $6.40 for it. While we were waiting for our drinks, we remarked how clean the place smelled and concluded that the place smelled like a combination of bleach and parsley. 

Overall, it's not a bad place, but probably not worth going back."}
{"text":"Ordered an acai bowl and wasn't really satisfied with it. Maybe it's just me, but it was really liquidy and didn't have nice consistency. 

Service was alright. They made the acai bowl but didn't really explain anything or help with the menu. Other reviews seem to love the acai bowl. Their acai bowl must have been way better than mine!"}
{"text":"Chocolate dream is my favorite here.  Can get crowded during the lunch rush."}
{"text":"The Chocolate Dream is my favorite smoothie at Nektar.  Their prices are very reasonable.  Be prepared to wait awhile though.  It also gets really loud with all the blenders going."}
{"text":"I tried Nekter for the first time about a month ago & the experience led me towards being a return customer. I take friends and family here often & they never disappoint. There is one gentleman that works at this location that is super awesome with customers & gives a great amount of knowledge if you have any questions. This shop is amazing, I will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Staff is kinda snobbish but drinks were super good! As a vegan, smoothies are something I could still enjoy as a replacement of my old favorite food, ice cream. Love that you can make your own combinations and fix what you don't like about the menu smoothies/juices!!"}
{"text":"Easy to get to, friendly staff, very clean! The whole place smells of fresh fruits and it just makes your mouth water. I really enjoyed this place. I got an açaí bowl (berry and banana) and it was amazing! I judged the size of it because of how small it looked but I ended up not being able to finish the whole thing, it is very filling. Which is nice considering after eating a bowl at Jamba Juice, I always feel like it did nothing. Prices are well set, considering what you're receiving. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"It never fails, every time we come to this location the service is extremely slow. The staff never shows any sense of urgency nor do they communicate if there is a problem with your order. After waiting 35 minutes for two juices we ask what the hold up is only to find out the juicer is not working. We will not be back to this location in the future."}
{"text":"What is there to say. It is a great juice bar albeit slightly expensive but worth it. I have tried three of their for Acai Bowls and my favorite is still the PB bowl. The chocolate dream smoothie is delicious (although the high in calories as is the PB Bowl) and the greenie juice is refreshing. All in all, when I am not hungry but want something, I always come here and it always satisfies whatever I may be craving (even if I am not really sure myself)"}
{"text":"They barely opened for the day and they were out of granola. Also got a health nut smoothie with whey and goji berries and can't taste either in it. It tastes like a bland ice drink with peanut butter. For how much everything here costs they don't have it together at all. The first time I came here the smoothie I ordered was out of this world but can't say any other experiences have been good at all"}
{"text":"The bowls are really good, and one of few places in our neighborhood you can find an acai bowl within walking distance.

However the service is extremely slow, and the people who work there seem to really not care about their jobs. Several times I've walked into the store with no one at the register. Instead, the employees are in the back, sitting on the counters and chatting. It normally doesn't bother me too much as I know they are young and the store can get slow at times.

Today my husband and I walked in and ordered an acai bowl, walked next door to grab a coffee, and returned to the store to get our bowls. When we returned, rather than going to the register we sat at a table and waited. After 5 minutes, the bowls weren't ready, and no employees had come out from the back to acknowledge us. My husband got up, went to the counter and found all 3 employees sitting on the counters in the back, chatting and eating acai bowls.

It turns out our bowls were made and taken by other customers. Fine, totally not the employees' fault, but the lack of alertness and sense of urgency in this store is appalling. A customer should not walk into a store and wait 5 minutes to be acknowledged."}
{"text":"This place looked very clean, the juice was pretty pricy as all the juice places are these days. But I guess I rather pay $6 for a fresh squeezed juice, then Starbucks for $5"}
{"text":"Had a slight issue with the take out option, BUT they made sure to have my order ready as soon as possible. AÇAÍ MANGO BOWL was yummy!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Everything here is fresh and delicious. All the juices are amazing. The açaí bowls are divine. When you order a juice WITH ice, they put your juice in the next size up cup. Love that detail. They are quick and efficient here too"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the people that work here. They are always in a great mood and give you such great customer service. Not to mention, the drinks are fabulous! Keep up the great work and energy! You're by far my favorite Nekter Juice Bar location."}
{"text":"First of all, what's up with the miserable life-hating gal working the register?  I mean, come on!  At least make the effort to pretend to be happy.  Then...about 3 people in back and only one making food.  Two people ahead of me and it took 15 minutes to get my Peanut Butter Acai bowl that came WITHOUT peanut butter!!  Thank goodness I've perfected this at home because I will not be back EVER!!"}
{"text":"Nekter just lost major points when they told me they don't refill water bottles .... but they'll let you add tot the plastic overflow In the landfill for $1.72.  WAKE UP.  Planet Over Profits.  Be part of the solution instead of the problem."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times to try different smoothies & they were all amazing.. Except one I was not a fan of but can't for the life of me remember which one! The service was good and my drink came out fast, which is a plus! Everything is so fresh ! I really want to try their acai bowls next! They look amazing! The drinks are pretty pricy tho... So it's a nice treat when I'm feeling too lazy to make my own!    The orange crush & pink flamingo are my favs!!"}
{"text":"I prefer to make these juices and smoothies at home, but if a place can actually make me eat, I mean, drink dates, then I'm ALL in!! I think my favorite menu item they have is their Date Smoothie, it's DEEELICIOUS!!! And this coming from a guy who doesn't like dates!! 
I've enjoyed their locations for a while, first in CA and now here, so I'm HAPPY that when I am unable to make my own, I can run in here. And their pre-packaged juices and smoothies are equally GREAT!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place I am there pretty often but my biggest complaint is that they should stop using agave nectar and use honey instead. I'm surprised a healthy juice store hasn't updated in that way as agave is pretty widely accepted as being bad for you while honey is a great alternative and health boost especially if local. 

Onto the things I like. Their acai bowls are some of my favorite because the consistency and flavor is good and their granola is yummy! They are huge bowls and very filling. 

I really enjoy their fresh pressed juices but I do not recommend the bottled ones. They have too long of expiration dates and from what I've read, cold pressed juices lose a lot of value the longer they sit. They also start to taste weird the longer they sit.

 My favorite juices are the toxin flush and the sublime. I like blending the sublime with pineapple- delicious!! The Popeyes smoothie is really yummy as well and I personally like it with cinnamon. I also was obsessed with their seasonal pumpkin smoothie and wish they would bring it back!!"}
{"text":"Really glad to see a Nekter out in Las Vegas!  We stay at Red Rock Casino when we are in town to visit family and always stop by Nekter when we are shopping.  The employees are great and the juice is always good.  FYI there is no better way to cure a hangover than a good juice cleanse."}
{"text":"I love this place because i fresh fruit and vegetables make me feel good and they are good for my tommy."}
{"text":"Nekter is life. It keeps me healthy. It keeps my poops regular. And it makes my skin glow like a healthy 11 year old girl. Nekter"}
{"text":"After a couple of visits and after trying 4 variations, Lacklustre. 
Interior is nice and clean. 
So tired of constantly being pushed to TIP."}
{"text":"I've been waiting and waiting for this location to open and today's the day !  Got my acai bowl and smoothie this morning.  Super fresh ingredients !  Nice staff !  Pretty sure I'll be a daily customer !"}
{"text":"The cold pressed bottled juices are good here.  

However, The fresh juices that they make are disappointing every time.  I am ready to give up trying.  All juices that have anything green in them end up tasting the same because of the order in which veggies and fruits are put into juicer.  And so they just end up putting many handfuls of celery or cucumber through at the end to get the volume to the correct level."}
{"text":"There's a new juice bar in town and I challenge you to check it out if you're down...

For some reason, the above line came to me this morning as I sipped on my fresh juice from Nekter... It was \"The Glow\" by the way, and it was delicious!  With carrot, parsley, kale, spinach, celery, lemon and ginger in it, they say that \"your skin will have a flushed and refreshed look after drinking.  I guess another side effect from drinking this may be creativity.  Way to glow!

This was my second of what is sure to be many many visits to Nekter in my immediate future.  My first time in, I purchased a few of the pre-bottled drinks and brought them home.  One of the ones that I really liked was the skinny lemonade... I loved the tart lemon flavor and the tiny bit of cayenne as well.

Alexa M told me about this place and she didn't steer me wrong.  The place is clean and welcoming, they have wifi and a decent amount of tables, and the employees seem friendly to boot!  There are plenty of other juices, smoothies, and healthy bowls on their menu that I look forward to trying and soon.  

Of course, if you're looking to do a juice cleanse, Nekter offers several options ranging from 1 day to 5.  Go try a juice... you've got nothing to lose!"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm super excited that a juice place has finally opened up in my area!  I walked in and the place is a cute small little spot, but very clean and I like the look plus they have a couple of outside tables. I was greeted right when I walked in and the girl at the register was very friendly and helpful... Customer service goes a long way with me  So I decided to go with a smoothie, but they also have juices and acai bowls which look delicious. 
I ordered the date nut which reminds me of yummie banana nut bread, which I love! 

Just a heads up for anyone looking to grab the cleanses or bottled juices, they said they wouldn't be getting those for another week or two.

I'll definitely be going back..."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!  This place just Keeps getting worse!  Was dirty when u walked in... no one was in the place and all the employees were in the back having a good ole time so I finally had to summon someone to serve me.  The teen acted like I was a disturbance and then gave me a tropical smoothie that was nothing like the tropical smoothie I have had so many tines at the really good nectar on Scottsdale Road.  The cup was about 3/4 full for more than 10$....Nectar should NOT allow this place to use their name!!!  Their service and product are NOTHING like the other Nectars and I am an avid juice/smoothie consumer!  Someone else PMEASE purchase and run this store!!!  I was SO excited when they opened at desert ridge since it is so close to me and now I feel like I'd be an idiot to go back.  This has been At least my 3rd bad experience there.   Help Nectar people that care!!!"}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale for 5 weeks and probably went to Nekter 8 times! The juice was main the draw, and the Toxin Flush was amazing!  It has apple, lemon, parsley, spinach and ginger.  Many a morning after drinking the night before this would wake us up and get us going for the day!

They also have amazing açaí bowls and this heavenly dessert called the skoop.  It's a cashew milk based frozen treat, and it was absolutely decadent.  Being dairy free, this was fulfilling an ice cream craving and chocolate need that is usually lacking.  I miss it here dearly, and will be returning on my next trip!"}
{"text":"To juice or not to juice, that is the question. 

Let me start this review with the fact that I've been trying to get to this location for over two weeks. Why the obsession out ask? I had the opportunity to visit one in Colorado in February 2018. I was an instant fan. The fresh fruit, great customer service and such a clean environment. 

We eat with our eyes first. Now, having said that, I was expecting the same or better experience in my town of Phoenix. The bar was raised in Colorado...and then lowered at this location. 

Upon entering the location, I was still excited by the anticipation of replicating my Colorado experience, but good grief Charlie Brown, this place was such a disappointment. The best thing I experienced was the awesome customer service given when I called to verify their location because my gos was clearly distracted by something because it had me going in circles. I wish I could recall her name. I called around 2:54 pm. Anywho, back to the review.

The decor gave a Huntington Beach  vibe. The oversized stretch canvas wall art was positive with being preachy (is that a word?)lol

The location was bright with minimalist decor. There were only 3 young ladies inside enjoying their healthy Nekter delights. So, I didn't think it would take as long as it did. I'm still waiting for my wig to be blown back, by great customer service, or clean tables and prep area...NOPE not here. 

Pros:
Fresh ingredients 
Agave nectar 
Reusable paper bags with handle to take your items home.
Great colored spoons and straws
Self serve cooler
A rewards program (that no employee here nor Colorado advised me of. I only knew of it reading other reviews.

Cons:
Uninviting, but not mean employees.
Dirty eating areas inside and out.
Minimally stocked self serve cooler.
Dirty prep area ( a friend came with because of my recommendation based on my Colorado experience).
Order taker/cashier wasn't very helpful with suggestions as Stevie Wonder could see my friend was clearly undecided.
The Strawberries weren't sweet and crunches like an apple  

My friend didn't like her bowl and went back to advise of such and the guy asked \"do you want me to just scrape off the toppings?\" Seriously? And the bowl cost more. So, I was actually due a refund for the difference. 

Marketing needs improvement ( I had a yelp coupon, for checking in, for a FREE ginger shot. The cashier wasn't familiar with it but honored it as they did on Colorado. I have a feeling this coupon was the idea of someone in corporate.)

The self serve cooler wasn't fully stocked.

Overall, I would come back to give this location another opportunity to knock my socks off. I wasn't completely in love  with this location, but based on the location and the demographics, this location will need to step up their game."}
{"text":"Very upset with my last experience. 

I visit Nekter several times a week. I've gone through several pages of rewards because I'm there so often. I always order the Toxin flush or pink flamingo. I just learned I am gluten intolerant and up until then, when I would have stomach aches, I would order a toxin flush because it would make me feel better. 

I live about 6 mins away from Nekter, depending on the traffic on 44th Street. And the other night I was not feeling well so I left to get a toxin flush. I am very aware they close at 7, so I high tailed it over there. I arrived at 6:49pm. When I entered, the lights were off which was odd. The girl working asked what I would like to order and I said a Toxin flush. She then told me that the juicers had been put away. I found that rather odd since Nekter is a juice and smoothie place so why would something that makes half the menu be put away prior to closing? If that was the case, why not lock the doors? I just said thank you and walked out. 

I found it rather unprofessional that he juicers would be put away before actual closing. I left the house specifically to get the drink and sadly disappointed. I myself was a manager of a retail store for 5 years and understand the importance of customer service. And I believe bat if customers were important to that individual that was working that night, that she would have made the drink."}
{"text":"This place is my nutritional sanctuary  I mean acai bowls....right up my alley. Everything here is so guilt free, full of vitamins and nutrients, and give you the best energy ever! I live 3 minutes away....thank god!!"}
{"text":"i decided to try out nektar after driving past it so many times on my daily commute to work. i stopped by after work and ordered an almond butter health nut. i was immediately greeted by milcah she was very nice and helpful and made my entire experience so much more enjoyable! not to mention she makes the most amazing almond butter health nut! i will definitely be stopping by here again soon!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to check out Nektar for awhile and am glad I did! The staff was friendly and prompt and made recommendations when asked. I went with the Banana/Berry Acai Bowl and it was delicious! It is essentially a THICK Smoothie in a Bowl topped with Banana, Berries, and Oats/Grains. I though it was a delicious and healthy post-workout snack and it was filling.

I would absolutely return to Nektar and can't wait to try some of their other Smoothies and Bowls!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this place after my workout with my fiancée. We came in here today and she got their chocolate scoop, and I got the health nut smoothy with almond butter instead of peanut butter. So good! I also love getting their dragonfruit bowls. Keep up the good work Nectar!"}
{"text":"I just recently came back from vacation feeling like a fat, drunk slob and decided I needed to detox. A quick google search and a couple of blogs later I decided that a Nekter Classic Cleanse was going to be just what the doctor ordered. Having never done a cleanse, I went 3 days instead of five (although they do offer in any increment you want) at $45/day. 

The first day was rough - no lie. Headaches all day long (could also be because I am an iced tea fiend and I went cold turkey on this with the cleanse), I couldn't wait two hours so I could drink my next juice. I had to have a little munchie (avocado wrapped in lettuce - Nekter approved snack on a cleanse so don't hate). I also realized that I would not be exercising on this cleanse -- even though you can and I had purchased extra juices for post-workout--because my workouts are rough and I would have certainly passed out. 

The second and third days were a breeze! THANK GOODNESS! The juices are delicious and I feel great coming out of it. I wasn't doing this as a weight loss method, and I swore to myself there would be no weight checks because any weight loss will be water weight and gained back once i started back on food. What I wanted was a reset and this did exactly that. It was head and body clearing and now i can refocus on eating healthy and exercising. Would definitely recommend and will definitely do this next time I need to reset and refocus."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Nekter shops both in AZ and CA and can say this was the cutest one! The people who worked there were extremely friendly. I ordered a banana berry acai bowl with whey protein and felt like I got my moneys worth. A few of the other locations I have been to don;t always put the amount of food that you pay for, but they made sure to fill the bowl to the top! Another great thing about this location was that it took maybe 5-7 minutes to get my food! It was around 11:30 when I ordered and was surprised when there wasn't a line at all to order. My food arrived a lot quicker than other locations as well which was a huge plus.

The outside patio tables are a bit dirty but when I tried to clean it, it seemed to be stuck on there, so I;m assuming they tried to clean it at one point but realized there wasn't much they could do. Something I also noticed was that their bathroom was clean and very modern. I was truly impressed by how the store was kept up and look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Generally I think Nekter has a good product. From my understanding, the products are not organic. The prices are very high. Watch the expiration dates if you are planning on getting anything out of the cooler and not drinking it in the next few days. The app doesn't generally work for us when we go in. I think they have changed apps several times. No phone number to call the stores when I called the corporate office they did not follow through with our conversation about about where to get some of the cleanses. I like their products but I'm not impressed with the rest of their operations."}
{"text":"If you don't mind waiting 20 mins for what you ordered or when u try to do their reward scan and they tell you since I already rang your item and I cannot give you your points, then have at it. Not a place to go to before work in the a.m. but the bowls are very tasty. Poor customer service. I will be trying another location. The wait happens every time."}
{"text":"The juices are tasty and the service is friendly, but I purchased a 32 ounce juice and more than half of the cup was foam.

Not sure if 32 oz includes foam?

I will be back, but I will mention a 1/2 foam / drink to the staff if it happens again. I was thinking that this was normal, but I looked through other Yelp pics and their drinks were very lose to the top of the cup. And if you are wondering, I took two very small sips before my picture.

Perhaps something happened to my drink along with the other person who ordered one as when I was about to leave in my car, the other lady who got a drink served at the same time was walking back into the store with her drink."}
{"text":"The Acari Super Bowl is super delicious here! The employees are very welcoming. Specifically, an employee named Jen H. her attitude is amazing! Every time I come to this place she seems to always be smiling and interacting with costumers very well. I appreciate the vibes from this place!"}
{"text":"I am a little hmmmmmm about Nekter...  I went to the location on 20th and camelback and they messed up my order, and now this location messed up today.  They are pricey, and the smoothies are so diluted, way too much ice."}
{"text":"After a workout a few doors down, we were looking for a place for a light bite to eat. We stopped into Nekter to get smoothies. I had the health but, and my friend had the mango one. The service was fast, and the store was clean. The smoothies were a good size, and very filling too."}
{"text":"The smoothies are really good and everything and I'm sure it is very good for you, but when it comes down to it our bodies break down everything into sugar fat and protein. Therefore spending 9 dolllars on a small shake is a little too much."}
{"text":"Ok..so yes I am stoked to have a juice bar close to home that is reasonably priced but the service...my God! 15 min waits for a juice?!? Not so fast food..it's not the employees' fault..everytime I've come in there is one working the register and 1 making the juice. If they had more employees I'd be here all the time but I don't usually have 15 min to wait around"}
{"text":"I got the Acai Bowl and it was so yummy. The Acai was kind of tasteless and it had a smoothie like consistency. The fruit was fresh and yummy. Super healthy treat."}
{"text":"Enjoying smoothies at nekter! I tried to look at a menu of smoothies online to write specific ones my husband and I enjoyed, but was unable to view one. Oh well! Mine had dates in it and my husband's had orange juice in it. Both of us were very pleased with the quality of our smoothies, which we felt were worth the price. The employees were courteous, efficient and knowledgeable about the products! Would definitely recommend Nekter to everyone!"}
{"text":"Love!  Love! Love this place!!  I feel like family when I walk in there!!  Lindsay, Nate, and Kaitlyn are always so friendly and welcoming!  I believe I've tried almost everything on their menu and love all of it especially after a hard workout at OT!!  Thanks Nekter for being so great!!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent smoothies and bowls. Had the tropical smoothie which seemed to have a lot more Kale in it than expected for \"tropical\". My daughter had the acai/mango bowl which she loved. Prices are kind of high for smoothies and bowls though."}
{"text":"This place is run by a bunch of 16yr old kids who answer the phone \"hello?\". If I wanted to be called \"dude\" and \"bro\" I would've hung out with my kids friends."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and it's been very hit and miss. The Pink Flamingo is one my favorites, however I'd enjoy it more if it tasted the same each time!

The first time I came, it was amazing. I went back the next day and ordered a larger size... That was a huge mistake. Not only was the wait SUPER long (15ish minutes, even though there was only three customers inside) but the drink tasted VERY different from the first one I had the day before! Not sure why, but there isn't an excuse when it's all the same ingredients...

We stop in every now and again to try new things, but nothing is over the top \"oh my goodness, I love it\" here."}
{"text":"1st time here! They would have received 5 stars BUT....the young man on the register was really nice, the lady B4 me was called 4 her order and a few minutes after I went 2 the counter to get the wifi info (that didn't show up in my iPhone)  then that's when I noticed MY order just sitting there. The guy from the back DID NOT call my name. So what if I never got up? He claimed he wasn't the one to bring it out...looks like that's your job 4 the day. Anyway things happen maybe it was a \"little\" mistake who knows. I'm going to still have a \"Fabulous\" day!
    I had the Acai Banana Berry Bowl  it was good but would have been better if that experience did  NOT happen. You know I'm NOT going to 4get it. The bad thing about it is that this location is 5 min. from my home. I'm BIG on customer service- I have to deliver the best everyday to my clients and I expect the same. 
Anyway NO 5 Stars due to that happening to me today."}
{"text":"This is a great place. One of the workers , chloe helped me and she made the most perfect pitaya bowl. She was super nice and asked about how my day was going. When I had questions she immediately knew an answer about all the different kinds of juices. Will DEFINITELY be coming back here. Gave her a nice tip as well!!"}
{"text":"This off-the-menu piña colada bowl is EXACTLY what I had in mind. It took me to paradise in the middle of the winter.  thank you to the kind, joyful man who made this for me."}
{"text":"Sour but delicious! The little beet is so healthy and organic. Fast service and just a delight to refresh with."}
{"text":"The staff is always very nice and welcoming, and the acai bowls always taste good. But if I hadn't also been to the Tempe and Phoenix/Scottsdale locations, I wouldn't be aware of how much they skimp on the fruit and actual acai in the bowls. The color of the acai base is MUCH darker purple and they put way more fruit in the bowls at the other locations. Significantly more. It makes me not want to visit this particular location just knowing that I'm going to get skimped on the best parts of the bowl. 

I'm not saying it's being done intentionally but it is noticeable. Maybe they're just not putting the right proportions? Either way, I would much rather visit the other locations for my acai bowl."}
{"text":"I doesn't get any more fresh or raw than this.  Green or fruit juices made on the spot.  I've tried a couple of the green juices and a smoothie, and all have been delish.

As others have mentioned, expect a 10-15 minute wait for your fresh juice/smoothie to be prepared.  It's still faster/easier than firing up my Blendtec or Breville juicer and spending 30 minutes in prep, juicing, and cleanup."}
{"text":"What I noticed right away when walking into any Nekter location is the delightful smell of freshly juiced fruits and vegetables. I love the smell!

I also love the baskets of fresh fruits and vegetables . . . it took me a couple of visits to realize the baskets of fresh fruits and vegetables were in fact realistically fake!!!  They look real enough to eat!!!

The menu is simple and straight forward. And I appreciate that they list the calories of each juice and smoothie so you can make the right choices. 

I've had 3 or 4 of their juices/ smoothies and they are all refreshing and tasty. 
Anyone who has gone here has told me how much they love their juices/ smoothies. 

As for the wait. Be GLAD for the wait- cause then you know you are getting the real product and not some type of syrup that they are calling real juicing. If you have ever done juicing or made smoothies from scratch before (like I have)- you KNOW each serving takes a while to make!!!  As for the price?  When you juice or make fresh smoothies on your own, you come to realize even one made at home cost $3-4 dollars by the time you add up the cost of all the fresh fruit/ vegetables and other ingredients!!!

I love Nekter- I hope they are successful and stay around for the long duration!"}
{"text":"Great service here!! Did my first order through the app, and it was ready a few minutes before I had ordered it for which was perfect because so was I. Super friendly staff and my acai bowl was super yummy! Been to other locations but will definitely be visiting this location lots."}
{"text":"Fresh juice and smoothies are always great but the circus show behind the counter is a bit much to tolerate when I'm on my lunch break. Waited almost 20 minutes while one girl wandered around aimlessly and the other screamed because there was a bee flying around.  I wasn't offered ice or a straw when my order was finally complete. I'll come back for the juice but I hope the customer service improves.  5 stars for this juice!"}
{"text":"So I was completely disappointed earlier this year when Nekter took away the vanilla Skoop! My husband and I love going out for a treat off and on and at that point they only had chocolate and strawberry. I consider myself unusual when it comes to ice cream because there aren't many flavors I won't try, but most people swear up and down by vanilla. My husband is one of those vanilla fans that isn't crazy about fruitty or chocolate ice creams. I guess my advice to Nekter is make sure vanilla is always on the menu, and switch out the other flavor or add more flavors instead of just two! Vanilla is so universal, that you can make it fruitty with toppings or chocolately with toppings as well. 

I hope one day to get to try their strawberry, but hopefully they will carry vanilla and strawberry at the same time next year! I do find their chocolate Skoop to be richer than the vanilla. 

So fast forward to our recent visit, Nekter brought back vanilla - but there's a twist.. it's black. So I love seeing new holiday treats, but what I don't love is all the added dyes, preservatives, chemicals and what not. I often wander the grocery store aisles seeing all sorts of new treats I can't have, because when I look at the ingredients I'm overwhelmed by everything they put in \"food\". 

I come to Nekter because things are more natural here and wholesome (and Skoop is dairy free), and their Scary Skoop is no exception. I was excited when I opened my email last week to discover a Halloween treat I could actually get behind eating. I'll be honest, vanilla to me is ok on it's own and not necessarily my first choice unless it has toppings or is part of another dessert like apple pie. I also do not like creamsicles - I'm not a big orange fan. I also 95% of the time do no order cones, because they are just added calories, and in my opinion don't add anything extra for those calories. So this being said, I'm probably not the target market for the Scary Skoop; my husband however is (loves creamsicles, cones, and vanilla). 

We both ordered a Spooky Skoop and I can say I was pleasantly surprised. The activated charcoal didn't impart any overly noticeable flavor to the vanilla (you just have to get over the look of it.. which is really neat for Halloween). The cone was light and super crispy and was not an artificial orange taste, strong enough but not too strong. I hope Nekter keeps the cones around and brings in some of the other flavors that Konery makes.. like Birthday Cake? Red Velvet? Cinnamon Brown Sugar? Chocolate Hazelnut? Yes please! Konery and Nekter have completely changed my mind about cones.. but no, I still don't want a normal cone somewhere else. 

My visit was good, but the only thing that could make it better would be quicker service. I was able to order quickly, but it took about 5 minutes before my husband and I were given our cones which is a long wait considering there were only a couple of people in the store (it was by no means packed). Better service would have resulted in 5 stars, so for now it's a 4."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of natural ingredients, so Nekter is obviously a fit for me. I've gone to other companies for their natural treats, and saw the free Skoop this Friday from 6-9pm and thought now was a good time to try it as any. I think this is a fantastic idea to introduce new products and get people trying your stuff. 

I ordered the chocolate, but was fortunate to have a little taste of the vanilla. I find the chocolate to be richer and creamier (funny, it's also lower in calories). I usually like both chocolate and vanilla equally. Toppings were delicious, though a little sparse when it comes to fruit. 

I can say for the serving and topping size, the price these will be selling at is too high. I've had similar natural offerings for MUCH larger portions for a couple dollars more. 

My recommendation would be to get the price point down to $3 for the plain soft serve and another $1 for the toppings. I can tell you I would be there every Friday for a weekly treat if the total cost was $4 instead of $5.25 (which me visiting more frequently will increase profitability than just visiting seldom). At a price point of $5.25 I could see myself visiting much less frequently and continuing to go to the competitors. For $5.25 I would expect 100% organic ingredients.  

I would also love to see a soft serve flavor in acai, which would work wonderful for your acai bowls. It is so much more delicious in soft serve - especially for breakfast on hot Arizona mornings! 

Service was quick and friendly at this location. Thank you for giving me the pleasure of trying this new product. I only hope you re-visit the pricing so you can see me a lot more!"}
{"text":"Every time I go here I leave extremely happy! The menu is great and has a variety of things. But what really makes the place, is the people that work there. It's the pinnacle of customer service! Friendly, helpful, happy, and fast service. As a consumer, and manager of a business, this kind of service combined with a good product makes this nekter stand apart from many many other businesses. I always look forward to my next Nekter trip by Scottsdale Quarter. The little beet today was amazing too!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their juices and smoothies, but there is consistently a 20 minute wait give or take 5 minutes. They need a better system or to at least notify the customer how long the wait time is when they order."}
{"text":"Personally, it's my favorite go-to smoothie shop. It's all vegan, and many gluten-free options as well. Don't be afraid to order some fun, exotic smoothies, they taste really good! My personal favorites are the pink flamingo smoothie, the superfood açaí bowl, and the pitaya açaí bowl. Highly recommend all of those! Also they have an app which is cool!"}
{"text":"It's almost ridiculous to have a section with purely Açaí Bowls (which happens to be a very strange invention for those of us who come from countries that have REAL açaí) and not really sell Açaí. Whatever you're putting in your so called bowls, coming from frozen, is definitely not açaí. You guys need to check your supplier."}
{"text":"Real improvement at both locations on west side of Vegas.  I haven't had any instances of them being out of something and I am guessing there have been some positive changes is staff and/or management"}
{"text":"I can't take nutritional supplements and can't eat enough fruits and veggies to maintain healthy nutrition so I rely a lot on juices.  I've had pretty much every \"green\" drink on the market - fresh and bottled.  Nektar is by far the best and since I watch them make it, I know exactly how much of what is going into the drink so it's dense nutrition.  I have a couple of favorites and usually stick to juice but I did try one of their \"bowls\" once and it tasted as great as it looked.

Definitely worth a try if you are looking for a healthy alternatives.

FYI - They are not organic."}
{"text":"Love this location. Great atmosphere, the drinks are always made perfectly and the staff is always more than willing to chat about any questions you may have about today's juice trends. Whether you're getting grab and go drinks or smoothies made to order- Nekter is always a great stop."}
{"text":"Although I had heard of Nekter, mainly from seeing it tagged in health conscious friends' IG posts, I had never tried it. This location is rather new and conveniently located to me, so I gave it a try. It's AMAZING! Staff and the customer service they provide are phenomenal, and the having tried the juices (fresh cold-pressed to order), smoothies & acai bowls, I'm in love. My 3 year old daughter even enjoyed the Pink Flamingo smoothie (which they sell in kids size for little bellies). They also sell pre-made detox and protein drinks in a small ready-to-go cooler area by the check out, although I haven't tried these yet. And there's a limited selection of granola & protein bars plus some kale chips in terms of snacks. 

If you're craving a treat, treat the Acai Berry or PB Bowl which is like sorbet almost and comes topped with fresh berries, banana & granola, making it a perfect breakfast or afternoon snack. Little less filling but equally delicious are the smoothies. Or get refreshed and energized with the juices without the hassle of cleaning your juicer at home (cuz anyone who juices knows it's a pain in who-know-where)! Drinks and bowls run around $5-7 ish and there's options to add protein, extra greens, or customize anything. 

For me, this place has been a great place to stop by with my daughter after preschool and/or a good way to ensure I don't go grocery shopping at Sprouts (same parking lot) hungry :)"}
{"text":"First time to Nekter today and was very impressed with Lexi's customer service. A great smile with a friendly attitude.She offered many selections and took the time to explain different menu items.  It was our first time here so we really appreciated it.  She really made our first visit a great one! Tried the seasonal Pineapple Mint juice. Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"The juices, bowls and smoothies are delicious. I especially like the superfoods acai bowl. The customer service at this location is awful! Even when there is no line it takes forever for them to make your order. I have encountered employees who have no idea what they are doing and some that are down right rude. Like the girl who asked if we were sure we wanted to sub OJ for cashew milk because that wouldn't taste good. My daughter has a cashew allergy so yes we want to sub and no, I don't want your opinion."}
{"text":"Quick Takeaway: 
Grab a nutritious smoothie, smoothie bowl or fresh pressed juice while you focus on your shopping game. Shop til' you drop then grab a smoothie. Done and done. 

Pricey?
Nah-- They're right in line with other juice/smoothie bars. Just don't come here expecting dollar menu quality or pricing and you'll be good.  

Worth it? 
Yes. You can't drive up to it easily so this isn't for your grab and go situations when you're not shopping (sad face). It's really targeted for those shopping and exploring downtown Summerlin. 

Where:
Downtown Summerlin (I believe it's right outside of Macy's)

Service: 
They were patient, friendly, helpful and outgoing during our visit. My husband and I were overwhelmed by the menu options and opted to try out their smoothie suggestion.   

We Ordered:
Two Pink Flamingos

Overall:
The cashier was friendly and suggested we try their most popular smoothie.The Pink Flamingo smoothie get's its name from the vibrant pink color.  The pink color comes from pitaya (aka dragon fruit). The pitaya was mixed with strawberries, pineapple and coconut water. Yum. This combo made for one cool and tasty beverage. I will be a customer and look forward to trying out their bowls and other flavors in the future."}
{"text":"Our favorite juice stop when we come to Vegas! Good service and a clean relaxed environment."}
{"text":"My favorite for a fresh squeezed juice!! I get the berry banana Burst or the toxin flush. Yum!"}
{"text":"Terrible app experience.  I order enough of these suckers to earn a free reward, redeem it through the app, then order through the app and receive an email confirming that if I have trouble with my reward, present blah blah code to the staff.   I did not receive the discount upon arrival, but showed the don't-worry-about-a-thing email to the workers and was given the deer in the headlights look.  Why have an affinity program that is impossible to use through the order-ahead system they promote???  

Also surprised when I called the GM the voicemail does not state name or company, just generic robot leave a message voice."}
{"text":"I have been to many Nekters around the valley and this one has been very disappointing on numerous occasions. Today I waited over 25 minutes for two smoothies and when they finally called my name, the cups were only 3/4 full. The sitting area was dirty and the kids working here couldn't seem to care any less. I hope this location gets their act together quick."}
{"text":"Amazing yummy juices!!! Love stopping by for a super healthy snack. However because they force you to use a horrible loyalty app and poor customer service I only will only rate them at 3 stars. Sometimes I feel like they are bothered I am here ordering a drink."}
{"text":"I came in the early afternoon. There were a few employees working and everyone truly seemed to be unenthusiastic and completely fed up. Not one smile on anyone's face, genuine or not. The store only had a few people in it including me, so I didn't understand why they looked so defeated. Not even a \"Hello, welcome,\" as I entered or a \"Goodbye, thanks for stopping in,\" when I left. Dropping by for a smoothie was a treat for me, but I was disappointed by the energy in the store. I really wish that it would have been a more memorable experience, but because of today, I think I will find another smoothie place to enjoy. On another hand, the prices are quite high for small smoothies that are mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service. I tried the detox drinks and some of those were awful but the acai bowls are awesome and the smoothies are great. Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience at this location yesterday. I frequent here a couple times a month and came in yesterday around 11 for an açaí bowl with peanut butter. After waiting 35 minutes and watching a bowl be made with just bananas and strawberries my name was called so I asked the girl did she not put açaí in my açaí bowl and she replied \"oh I must have forgotten \" and I asked about the peanut butter and she replied \"I forgot that also\". So with this I said how could you not put açaí in an açaí bowl and she then informed that as she was making my bowl they ran out of açaí and it takes about 30 minutes to \"cut\" so since I had already waited so long they just needed to give me something. No apology, no asking if I'd like something else or a refund . She just stared at me as I said I waited 30 minutes for an açaí bowl that I came here for and your telling me your his giving me something I didn't order since I already waited and she just blank stared back. I am not one to complain or wrote bad reviews especially at a place I love but I will never go to this location again. This was the worst customer experience I've ever received and I cannot believe there was not even an apology from this worker."}
{"text":"Was walking around downtown summerlin with my boyfriend & was having lunch later but needed something light that would be yummy! So we walked into this little cute shop first of all it was super hot inside no air conditioning. We ordered an acai tropical I was very excited but it took forever almost 20 minutes? Like really? My boyfriend had to get out of the building since it was so hot I stayed waiting for the bowl. After all the hassle of waiting and being hot the bowl came and I have to say it was VERY average. The acai was very sour and there was no sweetness to it what so ever. The banana is the only thing that provided sweetness. So I would really recommend to go else where!"}
{"text":"The pitaya bowl is a great pick, even if you are new to smoothie/acai bowl craze. Bananas, granola, agave, pitaya. If you prefer smoothies, the blueberry banana is okay- beware that it lacks sweetness."}
{"text":"I like the concept and we needed one of these here in Summerlin but the product is inconsistent at best. Some days they taste like flavored ice and you can't sip them through a straw. Other days the chunks are too big to get through a straw.  

They use tiny straw too, they need the larger smoothie straws! These straws are gonna give us old woman smoker face sucking through them. 

The girls that work there are hit or miss too on friendliness 

For the price the ingredients really should be organic and:or GMO free. 

And please get rid of the poisonous agave. Anyone healthy knows how this is made and it's very bad 

Lots of potential I'll try again next week. This is my fourth visit."}
{"text":"Nekter corporate Customer Service worked with me to resolve my issues, which is very much appreciated. It also appears that they have updated their website with information/nutrition for the new cleanses."}
{"text":"Great customer service! The young girl at the register was very pleasant. She even offered us the app to get a free drink next time!! 
   Ordered the pink flamingo ad it's very tasty!! I will definitely be back. They also have a juice cleanse that I've heard great things about. Looking forward to trying it out!!"}
{"text":"Great place if you're on the go and need to get your fruits/veggies in for the day or you just simply like drinking juices because they're yummy (me)! I go to multiple locations but this one is my regular since it's closest to me. 

Love the area, it's around so many shops/food places so it's perfect if you have other errands to run. It's usually empty when I go (like most of them) except one time I went around noon and it was pretty busy! Workers are typically nice, some more than others, and I'm pretty sure they know me by now as the customer who always wants her app scanned to earn a fruit! 

I've tried every juice on the menu and my two favorites are \"The Buzz\" and \"Toxin Flush\", and don't get me started on the pitaya bowl........amazing! I don't think I'll ever NOT go here at least once a week!"}
{"text":"The fact that this franchise is expanding so much makes me so happy!!! Perfect for anyone needing their healthy fix or just simply like the taste of fruits and veggies! Decor is light and airy, perfect location in the Biltmore area, it's around so many other stores/shops! 

They have plenty of juice/smoothie options for any tastebud, and they have recently added new menu items like the skoop nice cream (wooooo!!) and the \"blended juices\" (meh). I've tried everything under the sun basically but my favorite juices are \"The Buzz\" and \"Toxin Flush\", favorite smoothie is \"Tropical Cooler\", and favorite bowl is the \"Pitaya Bowl\"! Can't go wrong with any menu item but those are my staples. They also have pre-made juice cleanses and snacks in the cooler? (Don't know what to call it). They even have an app, which I find very useful because you get a free menu item when you scan the app after 10 purchases, they're always sending updates on deals and whatnot, and they even now have ordering delivery, whaaaat?! 

All in all, quality quality place, so glad it's in my life! Only thing is that I noticed the prices are slowly starting to go up, maybe because of such the drastic growth? Still worth it to me! :)"}
{"text":"I've been a Nekter lover for over 15 years and its sad to see the quality has deteriorated in the newer franchises outside of California. I was really excited to have a location so close to my house, but my experience was just so awful I'm inclined to switch to Bowlology or something else. 

I ordered an almond butter acai bowl to go, and when I got home I realized I really got half a container purple goop soup that with a sprinkling of banana chunks and a tiny handful of crushed up granola bits. For $10 its just unacceptable. 

I really love Nekter so I'm honestly just sad about this experience and don't know what else to say."}
{"text":"The only negative to this spot is the price, but then what you do get is good quality. I love to get the peanut butter acai bowl with chia seed. It comes topped with fresh banana and strawberry. My kids love their smoothies and I like them better than spots like Jamba Juice that use frozen yogurt as a base. The blends they offer are delicious or you can make up your own. My daughter also appreciates that she can get dairy-free options as she has problems with digesting lactose. Pricey, but worth the occasional splurge!"}
{"text":"Visited one day this week at lunch time. The wait for my juice was reasonable- maybe 5-10 minutes. The service was prompt and professional. I liked the little tables they had and waited there for my order. 

The juice itself tasted good, if not just a tad sweeter than I would consider perfect. It was called \"Toxin Flush\" or something like that. It was a blend of parsley, apple, ginger and maybe one other thing I've forgotten. It was just a little vegetable-y and a little spicy from the ginger. They gave me a choice of having it on ice or not (no ice!). 

The menu looks to be limited to the pre-designed selections. I don't think you can create your own combination. The price was lower than many other juice places and the location is convenient. Even though the huge parking lot is often completely full at lunch time, I found a spot right in front of the store the day I went. 

I will definitely visit Nekter again and try one of the other juice offerings."}

{"text":"This place is awesome to get some açaí bowls. Not many other options to go to in Vegas, but at least I know that this one is reliable.

Located in DT Summerlin, it is a perfect place to get a light snack or smoothie and stroll along and shop."}
{"text":"First time there, a little confusing but I had the Little Beet and the Toxin Flush, I was a little scared but both were very good, Great Service.  Also tried the Purps fuel and that was really good.  Might be a little expensive everyday but I think well worth your health!!"}
{"text":"AJ and  Lexy the dynamic duo!! Super friendly and helpful not to mention patient with 2 patrons that could not make up their minds! LOL."}
{"text":"Two words: BAD VIBES! 

I'm beyond surprised and disappointed in my experience I received here at Nekter. Maybe I hyped it up too much with the anticipation of wanting to come try this place out for a while now. 

Anyway, my best friend and I were in the area doing some Christmas shopping so we decided to stop and get a drink. Upon entering, all eyes on me. And not in a good way. I didn't feel like a celebrity but more so like everyone was dogging me and looking me up and down. The people there were already giving the place a bad vibe. While we were looking at the menu for some time we just went and decided on a smoothie each. Being our first time, we didn't know what to get. As we paid and sat down at the table to wait for our drink we noticed the ladies that were in front of us sitting across the way staring. I didn't mind that and I continued to stare at my phone and wait for my drink. 

As my name was called, I went to pick up both my drink and my friends. I didn't know which was which so I had nicely asked the lady. She said it so fast I didn't even know which was which still. After she had rudely said in her fast voice and disturbing attitude she quickly turned away so I didn't even want to bother asking a second time. I left with our drinks and we figured it out ourselves. 
Such bad customer service. 

After we both had a sip of our drinks, we noticed the two ladies that were in front of us yet again stare at us because they hadn't received their drinks. So they went up and confronted the workers. The rude lady deserved the confrontation by the customer but all in all it was such drama and bad vibes all together!"}
{"text":"Really expensive, not organic, and customer service is not great. It's super slow. That being said, I really like all the juices, smoothies, and bowls. Overall, I just don't think it's worth the money."}
{"text":"I really love their juices here but their customer service makes you not want to ever come back.  All 3 times I've been here the teenage girls act like they are doing you a favor by taking your order.  Usually takes 10+ minutes to get anything even if there is nobody else here.  They are just busy in the back gossiping."}
{"text":"I really like this Nekter location! I often order using the app, and my order has always been ready and waiting when I've arrived! The staff is super friendly, too. 

The juices, smoothies, and skoop are delish- I especially like the Pink Flamingo smoothie and Greenie juice. The choices are tasty but virtuous, too!"}
{"text":"I love the Greenie.  Just a great way to put more nourishment in my body and is so refreshing on a hot summer day.  Great environment and the staff is always so friendly!"}
{"text":"I love their acai bowls, tastier than Chop Shop's. lt's my third time here and I see a noticeable difference in the size of the filling. My acai bowl is filled just barely above the halfway mark rather than close to the top like they were the first two times I was here. And there's no granola on the bottom, what gives?

 So I asked the tall girl with tats who was helping me at the counter and she gets all irritated at me and says that the granola is a waste. Huh? A waste? What? She says that people don't like that the granola gets all mushy  being on the bottom. Okay...I said \"well I do.\"

I like the granola on the bottom and on the top like they made it the past two times I was here. It's like going to McDonald's and getting the fudge in the middle and on the top of a hot fudge sundae, it's just good like that. 

I also asked her why the bowls were smaller. Got the dismissive eye roll and she referred me to her manager. I'm shameless, so I ask him the same question because I love their acai bowls and I like to get value in what I pay for, I'm truly curious as to what's going on and I will decide whether or not I'll come back based on what he tells me. 

He says in a very nice, friendly, calm, tone that this store has been making them way over filled for a long time and that it's not happening anymore. 

The amount that is given is not worth the total price at $7.31. 

So three stars. Got to give them props for adding the granola on the bottom without charging me an additional price. And yes I would've griped about it if it happened."}
{"text":"First time having a smoothie bowl - and I shared it with my sis since I have some digestive issues when eating certain fruits. We got the ASU one, with blueberry/banana/strawberry/granola and let me just say... I just want to shove the granola in my gob with a smoothie on the side to wet it lmao!

It was pretty good, my only complaint was that it was hot and stuffy inside... like we we were going in to do some hot yoga... the floor was kinda sticky where we were at too so *shrugs* our smoothie bowl was good and the gals behind the counter were nice and helpful too :) wouldn't mind swinging around when I'm in Tempe Marketplace again, but I'd rather eat outside in the heat where there's misters so I don't have to bother with the inside..."}
{"text":"The acai bowl was really good. The vibe is cool and they also play good music. I would suggest they offer a small size in the bowls though, it was quite large and I wasn't able to finish it all. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Ended up going here. The vibe is cool and the staff was nice BUT my acai bowl was melting as soon as they gave it to me. I ate it there and by the time I was halfway done it was acai soup so I threw it away. I never had this happen at the other nekter on Hayden that I go to quite frequently.

Tried to call ahead with my order so I could pick it up on my way to work and the guy told me to download the app to place my order... Really??? 

1. I'm driving not going to download and then place the order on my phone 
2. Why would I waste space on my phone for an app I will rarely use?
3. What if you are like my grandma and don't have a cell phone with app capabilities?"}
{"text":"Great place!  All Nekter locations are good but this is my favorite.  I like the beet juice on the menu but all that I've tried are good.  Açaí bowls are fantastic.  Many times I stop in for the one day advanced cleanse bags that are ready to go.  Cooper who worked there was always friendly and helpful but everyone else seems nice as well."}
{"text":"i took my daughter and nephew here. We order two acai bowls and a smoothy...a total of $21 and some change. I do not mind paying this much if the food is good quality...this was not the case! the acai bowls did not have much flavor and the smoothy was tasteless. We will not be coming back to this place. Thrive is much better and the prices are more affordable. 
On a positive note, the service was good and the place is kept clean. very disappointed."}
{"text":"Although the Açaí bowls are good the employees have no sense of urgency, nor are they too welcoming. I'm currently in line with 2 people in front of me and about 6 ppl behind me with only one person at a register available. I've been here for a good 10 minutes and the same people who were ordering when I first walked in are still there. Pretty pathetic...will probably not come here again."}
{"text":"Good acai bowl, smoothie & juice options. A bit watery, but overall really great. Plenty of seating options, so that was a big plus for our large group over the holidays!"}
{"text":"A little too expensive for the portions. It's good but not enough for me to make a point of coming back."}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed with this place. Employees don't seem happy to be here, there's no happy greeting welcoming you, it's a rushed fast food style what do you want question I get from them while looking at the menu. It's not really inviting. 

This is my 3rd time here. We Recently moved to this area from the Sw part of town and maybe I was spoiled with Pressed for Juice, and Fruits and roots being across the street but the service and product here has made me want to make the drive to those places daily rather than support this establishment. 

My Cleanse I got the 1st visit. Although cheaper then the Cleanse's from Pressed for juice, it's packaged somewhere else not in this facility and not as many veriertys as the other Juice bars. 
2nd visit, employees were in the back took them a minute to greet me. 
Today's 3rd and final visit. They forgot my Almond Butter in my bowl I paid extra for, and once again when I noticed the employee was in the back no where to be found. 

This is not you local Mom and Pop Juice Bar its a corporate place lacking the care and love of every other local juice bar. This is one step below becoming a Jamba Juice. Go elsewhere for your healthy, vegan, juice options!"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Nekter, and my first at this location. The interior was clean, the menu self-explanatory, and the snacks shelf and cooler were stocked. 

The guy at the counter was not impressed with life. He was monotone, slow and not very friendly. The creation of my juice, however, was very fast. The guy that brought it out to me was super friendly, and thanked me for my business.

I had a 24oz. Tropical Greens juice. I thought that for having pineapple juice, it would have more flavor. I was underwhelmed. I did try some little packaged chocolate protein bites. It was like eating chocolate-covered peanut butter cookie dough. They were definitely my jam, and if it wouldn't defeat the purpose, I would pop those little nuggets like Pez!

I will likely try something different on another visit. I will also probably order online and pick up, which as you may know, I am quite fond of.

Oh, and I'll briefly address price. It is not cheap. A 24oz. juice and the bites was 14 and change. With an added tip, this wasn't a cheap visit to get a simple juice."}
{"text":"I ordered online so I could pick up and make it back to the office in time to enjoy my break. It's easy and convenient to order online... HOWEVER... they made the wrong bowl for me and I didn't notice until I was already back to my office.
I had wanted the BP bowl, but received the Acai Banana Berry. It was good. Very good. The fact that it's so close to my work and is vegan is awesome! 
But I'm still sad that I didn't get the peanut butter my heart was set on."}
{"text":"Really tasty, reasonably priced but.....SO SLOW! I completely understand the juicing process as I make them at home. I know how long they take to make and appreciate that. However, what I can do in my kitchen should not equate to what goes on in a restaurant. They only have 2 juicers. You will wait 10 minutes if there is no line...I've waited 30 mins before for my juice...so don't come here if you have somewhere to be. I do have to stay standing around watching peoples' faces while they are anticipating their name being called is quite entertaining. While the product is good, their productivity is poor. Juice bars are popping up all over the place...if these guys don't figure out a faster system to accommodate high volume, they will lose business quickly."}
{"text":"The pink flamingo is awesome!! Sweet and refreshing:) only reason why I didn't give it a 5 is because it's pricey, but all of these trendy juice bars seem to be:/ but was it worth the money? Sure as a special treat. But I'm not willing to pay $6 a day for a small one. Give it a shot it is good!"}
{"text":"Three simple words: Pumpkin. Pie. Smoothie.

Now, before you dismiss me as just another wild-eyed white girl inexplicably obsessed with all things pumpkin, allow me to reassure you that I am not that girl. Pumpkin and coffee are a combination as appealing as blueberries and cat vomit. Just... no. I will never photograph, post, or tweet about anything involving a PSL, unless I am making fun of someone. 

But pumpkin PIE? Let's talk. I had just finished returning an embarrassing stack of regrettable internet purchases to UPS when I saw the sign. First, a real live juice bar in my hood? On the way to work? Open when I drive by? No rush hour left hand turns required for ingress and egress? Boom. I hustled on in to be delighted by a nice big menu with juices, smoothies, acai bowls, and snacks. The green juices looked amazing but at this point I was like a dude in old town Scottsdale on Saturday night: on a Mission For Pie. I ordered one up from the marginally friendly girl behind the counter -- a little over five dolla. Not bad for a fancy ass smoothie. After the usual few minutes, the guy from the back (significantly friendlier than the girl) popped out with my glass of magic. 

It's a good thing I waited till I was in the car until I tried it because it was like a LOL cat came to life as the NOM NOM NOM sounds reflexively escaped my body. I have no idea how they do it. It is spot on pumpkin pie, minus a buttery crust and animal-derived ingredients. Perfect rich pumpkin flavor, heavy on the spices, and super creamy. AH-mazing. I got to the very bottom and there was one last small solid nugget so I scooped it up. Banana. BANANA? That shit IS bananas because I seriously did not detect a banana flavor at all. This trickery just added to the wizardry mystique of this glass of magic.

I am super stoked to have this place so close to home and I look forward to sampling every stinking item on the menu."}
{"text":"Their açaí bowls are great! Slightly spendy, but you are getting a good amount. I ate some of mine and then took it to go. It was so delicious! The fresh fruit was wonderful and refreshing on a hot day. I would definitely recommend and I know I will be coming back quite often. The açaí bowls can be eaten as a snack or a meal. My bf checked in using Yelp and received a free ginger shot."}
{"text":"Stopped in while I was running errands on this side of the valley...Nice staff, great juice. Too bad I don't live closer!"}
{"text":"The acai bowl really hit the spot on a hot, sunny day in Phoenix! This branch is conveniently located in a strip mall with parking. The shop has lots of healthy options but I was really satisfied with the acai bowl with bananas, granola and all the other fixings."}
{"text":"This is my favorite go to place for açaí bowls and is perfectly and conveniently located in Downtown Summerlin, just steps away when I'm finished with a hot yoga/Pilates class at TruFusion. Nekter has a great variety and selection of juices, smoothies and bowls for a healthy and delicious meal, snack or beverage. 

The employees are always nice and provide fast and friendly service. My favorite bowl is the açaí superfood bowl, which has so many good for you ingredients in it, including spinach, kale, chia, hemp seeds and bee pollen and topped with my favorite fruit topping combo of banana, strawberries and blueberries. And the pricing and portion sizes of the bowls are reasonable and good sized. 

Be sure to download the Nekter app where you can order ahead and earn rewards thru their loyalty program - one more left before I earn my free bowl!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb,! Juices taste just like when I make than at home, and the staff is always friendly.from laguna beach, and seal beach to Scottsdale, I will seek out nekter first when I need a green!!!!"}
{"text":"Very aesthetically pleasing atmosphere and the bowls and smoothies are delicious. I got the PB bowl and it was awesome! And it was healthy as well. Recommend to give this place a try"}
{"text":"Love the berry banana with protein smoothie. There is nothing but fresh veggies and fruit here. I usually get something for lunch and I'm not hungry again for four hours. Def. Recommended !!"}
{"text":"Omg!  I love the juices and smoothies at Nekter. Absolutely awesome service and wholesome goodness. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab a juice in Las Vegas! Tucked in near the entrance of Macy's in Downtown Summerlin, this cute spot serves up delicious juices that are juiced to order. And with a 16 oz for $5.95, 24 oz for $7.95, and 32 oz for $9.95, no other place can beat the prices. I'm actually really surprised by any negative reviews. I've been here numerous times and I always receive friendly service and yummy juice! 

I've only tried The Greenie and The Sublime because I'm a big fan of green juices and I think they are both really good. The Greenie is a standard green juice, something similar to what you would have in a juice cleanse. The Sublime is much fruitier while still being very green... the citrus makes this juice so good! It's my favorite. The best thing about the juices is that you can customize them! Don't like ginger? No problem. I always like to add ice to my juice and they always oblige nicely (they will put your juice in a bigger cup if you ask for ice).  If you're not feeling like juice, they have a nice assortment of smoothies for the same rates per size as the juices. They also have acai and pitaya bowls ($8.95 - $9.95). If a ginger or tumeric shot is your thing, you can get one of those for $2.75. 

Also, the cleanse is currently an unbelievable $39.95 a day (normally $45)! I don't think anything is organic, which is probably why they can offer such affordable prices. But do your research, organic is not always the best or necessary choice. And one thing is for sure, if you can't afford the organic places, it's better to have non-organic fruits and veggies than it is to not have any at all. 

Oh and one more thing! Their app is sooo convenient! I always place my order about 10-15 minutes before I pick up which is a time saver for me during lunch. You earn \"fruits\" with each order and once you get 10 fruits, you are rewarded with one free menu item :) I'm a huge fan of Nekter and I'll be back time and time again!"}
{"text":"Oops, my previous review was intended for the Nekter in Downtown Summerlin but as they offer the same juice at the same prices, everything I wrote still applies. The customer service at this location is even friendlier and faster. The girls working here on weekends are bright and smiley. I have used their app to also seamlessly order from this location. Love grabbing a juice here!"}
{"text":"Acai bowl was ok. Felt pricy at almost $9 for just one bowl even with the bowl being large enough for most people to share. It would be nice if they offered multiple sizes for those just looking for a quick snack. Wasn't personally a fan of the agave and will probably substitute my own honey next time, but that's personal preference. The cashier wasn't rude, but he wasn't overly friendly. I'll probably check out a few other places that offer acai bowls before giving the place a second chance, honestly."}
{"text":"I don't care to leave reviews but I'm actually taking the time to write one. This is this the third time they got the order wrong. HOW HARD IS IT TO ADD GRANOLA AT THE BOTTOM for acai bowls?? Plus they take forever making it so customers expect they'll do it right. The only employee that listens and is very nice is the Caucasian guy I do not know his name (I think he's a manager) at this point, it's time to go somewhere else. It's a disappointment because the product is actually good and tastes great. Pay attention a little more and you'll have repeat customer."}
{"text":"The bad thing is the juices are out of price control, the good thing is you get a free turmeric shot  when you check in on Yelp. Service is good and efficient.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing! I feel soooooo much better after drinking their juice. Will be back again for sure! And the staff is awesome."}
{"text":"What can I say, I'm a juice addict. Nekter just opened here Friday, but don't that fool you, this store has had a lot of success in other areas before gracing the Scottsdale area with its presence. 

  Upon walking in, the set up is open and inviting. There is a lot of seating so you can relax and sip your nutritional beverage. There's a \"grab and go\" section on the nearest wall along with nutritious bars and the like. The cashier area is in front of a great display of fruit. They not only do fresh juices but also the cold pressed juices in the grab and go section and 1-3 days cleanse packs! Nekter also offers various acai bowls, smoothies and wheatgrass and ginger shots. 

  Everyone is friendly and I enjoy the casual environment. I was able to meet Alexis--the owner, and Carly, the manager, who were both knowledgeable and extremely personable. Upon recommendation, I chose the Greenie. Of course the Greenie juice was sweet and delicious while I also grabbed a pre and post workout juice and a \"raspberry slimmer\" that had raspberry and chia seeds. 
  
 This is a great addition to the Scottsdale scene!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good healthy \"fast food\" type of place so I was super jazzed to find Nekter. I ordered a Tropical Cooler smoothie which was excellent, and a 24 oz is only ~ 300 calories (but it's enough to feel satisfied!). I am anxious to try the smoothie bowls, too!

The only reason I don't give Nekter 5 stars is because it did take awhile to get our order, but the employee indicated there was some sort of computer glitch so maybe it's a 1 time thing and I can update my review next time I go. It's also a tiny pricey, ringing in at $17 for 2 24 oz smoothies. But like I said earlier, it's filling and ~ $7 for a single person for lunch or breakfast isn't bad."}
{"text":"This place was alright. I guess I'm just not super into overpriced cold pressed juices and acai bowls. Not to mention there is only one table inside and it was occupied by a gaggle of typical Scottsdale women that just came from tennis so I had to sit at the gyro place next door. Most likely I won't be back."}
{"text":"Today while visiting my dentist office I stop in at this sweet find and boy was I happy I did. The orange crush was amazing. I'll will be back!"}
{"text":"Really unprofessional to run an advertisement that says $3 smoothies to come in and find out they're 2 for 10. 

That equates to less than a dollar of savings per smoothie. I wouldn't have driven 6 miles for a smoothie if I hadn't heard this false advertisement. I heard the ad the same day I came in.

Pretty disappointing for a first time visit. Don't think I'll come back"}
{"text":"Very cool place. Awesome industrial/modern design. Got the berry smoothie with whey protein boost. Tasty and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Need quieter juicing machines...sounds like an auto mechanic place."}
{"text":"I made a yelp account just to write this. I came in today and young man, I believe his name was Sam if I read the name tag right, doing 100% of the work while his coworker , a girl with short dreads, was doing nothing helpful and was being rude to me and him. I caught her going on her phone multiple times , and had the worst customer service I had ever experienced. If I ran a business I would not allow someone with this attitude to represent my store. That being said Sam made an amazing drink but sadly I don't think I'll stop back in while the young girl is working."}
{"text":"Every times I come in I have a wonderful experience! I recommend the toxin flush juice and my favorite bowl is the Acai Peanut Butter!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. They got my order wrong and when I asked for it to be remade the girl working was rude and had an attitude. The girl is Hispanic, dark medium hair, early 20s. Average build and about 5\"5'. When she remade it she dropped it off at the counter super loud and everyone looked at us. She didn't say a word, made a straight resting beach face and walked away. (She was the one who called out the order wrong) There was no manager on site?? Like what kind of business runs without anyone in charge? If you want to be treated like crap then I suggest you go here, other wise Jamba Juice is right down the street with much better customer service with a smile."}
{"text":"I love that they use cashew milk as a cream base, such a small thing that allows lactose intolerant people to try most things! Also, love the Acai PB bowl. If I could change something I would say the consistency. Sometimes its creamy sometimes its icy. also, I don't care for the apple slices they added recently either because I don't think it mesh's well with the flavors... but i just don't eat them so its not like my life is over haha.."}
{"text":"DON'T DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY here in LAS VEGAS!!!!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. I called to ask more information about one of the juice cleanses. An employee who sounded like an older man answered the phone as if it was his house phone without mentioning the company as any other business should. So I politely asked if I can get information about the juice cleanses. He rudely said \"go to the website\" its an \"800 number\" So I told him, don't give me an attitude all I wanted to know was information. So I told him, I refuse to do business because I was given an attitude as if I was stupid not to look at the website. So he then yells at me saying IT'S NOT MY COMPANY!!!!! . If you want to keep your business running..don't hire idiots like him. I was planning on buying a 3 day cleanse but from that experience, I rather have my money spent on a company who respects their customers not a company that YELLS AT THEIR CUSTOMERS!"}
{"text":"I am not the healthiest of people when it comes to food choices, however I have been feeling sick and ordered an acai bowl and a smoothie from this place. I cannot describe how amazing this is. I know I'm getting yelled at by my girlfriend tonight for ordering from post-mates again but damn this was worth it. 

GET THE ACAI BOWL!"}
{"text":"I stopped by at excacly 6:37 pm and the place was closed ... Two employees inside cleaning but closed... Google Maps, Apple Maps and even Yelp state that they are open until 8:00pm ... No business hour posted anywhere in the business ... Second time I stopped by and business is not open when they r supposed to ... Very disappointed"}
{"text":"The beverages are kick ass but I seriously wait from 20-45 minutes each time I'm here and it's kind of nuts. There is usually 1-2 people present but they definitely need more employees.. Like bad. It's always clean and smells great and some days I don't mind waiting because the product is so good but it's a real pain when they tell you 10 minute wait time and it's really 30. Customers are always upset and it shows. I will keep coming here because like I said, the product rocks!"}
{"text":"Delicious, clean, friendly! Here on vacation and happy to have found this place to continue my juice fast!"}
{"text":"I love Nekter! It is my healthy addiction! Always happy with the freshness of not only the juices, but with the day cleanses. Employees are always welcoming."}
{"text":"The toxic flush was good, the sublime was not so good. Pricey but healthy. Staff isn't very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"I was really happy with my visit there today. Thank you Nekter!"}
{"text":"Amazing healthy juices, smoothies and fruit mix bowls. The pink flamingo is refreshing and tasty! All natural and fresh fruit so its not overly sweet."}
{"text":"So this is my 3rd post? Nektar had full turn around in the staff and now they are running much better.  The juices are fantastic and the service is extensive improved."}
{"text":"Really yummy smoothies and acai bowls, and healthy. Large portions for the price, health food is always pricey so comparatively it's not bad. If you go here though, expect to wait in line for five minutes to order then another 15 to get your order, if it's a quiet day. Friendly staff but they do not have enough people working and enough machines to fulfill the orders they take."}
{"text":"Yay! Love Nekter and this location is great. Lauren and Angie greeted us with great energy and super knowledgeable with all the questions I had. They definitely made my experience. 

Get the Skinny Lemonade before you go!"}
{"text":"Love the juices. The charcoal lemonade is my favorite. The cold presses juices are really great, and the turmeric shot. The only problem is the some of the lemonade are never in stock. I been going two weeks in a row for the lemonade and still nothing. Hopefully, they restock soon."}
{"text":"Feels very much like a chain. I've been to many juice bars and this isn't my favorite. The fridge was nearly empty despite being early afternoon. I asked the girl if the juice is bottled at the location and she said no, they're shipped there. That was surprising to me. I got a small smoothie, juice, cherry ice, muffin, and cookie for $27 which I thought was very reasonable. My juice and smoothie were very good. My husband loved his snacks and cherry ice. One of the staff members was extremely nice and the other was less than pleasant. I felt bad for the nice girl because she had to go in the back to ask for help making smoothies."}
{"text":"Acai bowls are great. Smoothies okay. Juice costs way more than it should for what it was...and the main reason for 2 stars was that we have now twice been charged for tips that were above the amount written so watch out."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here a couple days each week they are wonderful here and most importantly Jen treats me like family.

Great smoothies and bowls too"}
{"text":"Nektar just opened very close to my work and we were all very excited. They have fresh pressed juices, blended smoothies and acai bowls. They are also going to be getting in a line of detoxifying cleanses in a couple of weeks. So far I have tried the buzz which is a mix of carrot, orange, lemon and ginger and it is delicious. It is around $7 for a 24oz juice or smoothie so, they are definitely not cheap but very healthy. The acai bowls are also delicious. They are pretty much a blended type of sorbet made of acai berries and cashew milk, topped with fresh fruit and granola, they have 4 flavors of these.

Overall my experience here has been great so far. I have met the owner/manager and he is very nice. The service has been great so far. It does take about 10 minutes to make a fresh juice so just be prepared for that time. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Looking for juice bars to try out is always on my list when visiting new areas. Being an avid juicer/vitamixer I am always open to new ideas. Nektar is located in the newer Summerlin shopping area and has a nice, earthy decor. Wooden planks and scenic naturalist photography line the walls. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The menu has a nice variety of juice and smoothie options. Most of the smoothies have cashew milk as the \"milk\" in the smoothie. My daughter got a strawberry banana smoothie which she said was fine. I think she thought it'd be sweeter, I tried it and it was pretty good, but I don't go for ultra sweet tastes. I got a green juice consisting of spinach, kale, green apple, lemon, lots of extra ginger and I added cayenne myself. It was good, I still must add a lot more ginger  to my home drinks than anywhere else (minus Fully Loaded in Leucadia ) bc when I say I want a lot of ginger, bring it on people. This didn't have the kick I was hoping for. 
Over all, the place is nice, I like how more juice bars are popping up and introducing more to healthier alternatives to enjoying beverages."}
{"text":"Hands down worst service ever. There was no knowledge on the products being sold. The manager at the time was extremely rude. If I could speak with the owner of this location that would be great. Will not return.  This is a disappointment since I was going to be using their juice for our pasta at a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that my score in no way reflects the service.... The cashier was not very friendly for it being my first visit. It was not busy so it wasn't like we were keeping her from helping other customers but for being our first visit, she seemed disinterested in answering questions about the menu. Ultimately I ordered what I thought would be good and when it was all said and done, the juice was delicious and I will definitely coming back! I tried the toxin flush and will try every juice they have on the menu"}
{"text":"I bought a green juice here and when I tried it I was surprised that I didn't like it at all. I tried to drink it and just couldn't. My friend told me to just take it back and so I did.

For some reason the drink tasted very spicy, which was weird because there was no ginger. Later I discovered that there was a good amount of celery in there that made the drink taste spicy.

Normally I'm cool with drinking green juices, but the fact that this had a lot of celery in it made my stomach feel weird and I didn't want to get sick. I will admit there are just certain food and condiments I just can't handle.

I asked the guy at the register if there was any way he could make me something else and he didn't even hesitate and said yes. Wow! That's what I call great customer service!

I paid the extra money for a more expensive drink and gave him a tip for the favor. I liked what I ordered the second time around, which was an almond protein drink that tasted pretty darn good.

I'm definitely impressed by the juice selection and the great service and will be coming back real soon. If you haven't tried Nekter I highly recommend you do so... you won't regret it!

Thanks NEKTER JUICE BAR!"}
{"text":"I love my juices! This place has so many options for kids and adults. You can add whey protein or pea protein to anything you order. They also offer things such as protein bites, snacks, pre made juices for cleansing. I have done a 3 days and as hard as that is the juices are pretty dang good. I usually get whatever I'm feeling like with no guilt. For those of you that can't have dairy or glutens they have an ice cream like treat called scoops and oh my Lord is it to die for. Add fruit or granola you won't regret it. They offer acai bowls that you can't beat. Try the buzz, the flamingo, the toxin flush. The flamingo is good for a first timer. I would say my only complaint is their close time. Most open early enough to get in there before work or after my early am workout but they close too early. I wanted to go for a smoothie this evening and came they were closed by 6 pm on a Saturday even. That would be my one complaint. I left the gym wanting a smoothie and was really disappointed to see they had already closed. They also at this location are not very friendly. I had a very snobby girl assist me the other day. She acted as if everything I asked for my 2 questions and my order were the most annoying things she's heard all her life. I am a kind person who has always been in customer service and owned my own business for years and I wouldn't ever allow someone that worked for my business or works for me now to come across to my customers that way. If you don't want to be there leave. But with that said. I go for the juice and bowls. And it's not all locations most are very friendly so don't let that stop you from trying it out. It's a health nuts dream in here."}
{"text":"Great service at this location. Quick service.  Made me a perfect smoothie. I went with mango, and protein."}
{"text":"Love nektar juice bar. It's a great place to go when your fuel is running low or a healthy pick me up in the morning. All juices are fresh and delicious. Nekter is always delivering great quality juices, with the freshest of ingredients, in an excellent amount of time, with a smile on their face, can't ask for more."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a shout out to the staff ! I have come here twice and both times the staff was very friendly with 
Great customer service!! I usually get the buzz or toxin 
Flush both are delicious!"}
{"text":"Was reaalllly craving a green smoothie or juice to rid myself of the New Year's Eve hangover - you know how it is. All the places I tried looking up prior to Nekter were closed for the holiday, and the others listed as \"juice bars\" weren't what I was looking for. Finally came across this place, made a short drive, and got my dose of veggies in the Toxin Flush. Felt so cleansed after and it even got rid of the headache I had been carrying around all morning. I also like that they will ask you if you want the juice over ice but serve it to you in a bigger cup so that you are not sacrificing volume. Great service, great product, great place."}
{"text":"Fun and interesting, this was a nice little place to visit. We went on a whim. The green protein drink didn't taste very good to us,  but the Pink Flamingo was great. FYI: Pitaya is dragon fruit."}
{"text":"Seriously had the worst experience ever at this juice place, enough to change my review. I have gone to all branches including the ones in California and have never had an experience like this. Every time I come I am always welcomed with a smile and positive energy and great conversation. Her energy was so negative and it gave such a bad vibe to the place. I come here often and always get discounted for bringing my own mason jar ( every location I have been to, including California), every single time. She told me that they only discount for their cup. She continued to tell me that she was the manager and they do not give discounts even though I have always gotten it, and even made a yelp review about how awesome it is. I have come here so many times and have always had a pleasant experience. Just because you are having a bad day, does not mean you need to push it on your customers. I will not be returning to this juice bar. First they encourage you to bring your own container so that you do not pollute the planet with plastic and then tell you it only works with their plastic jars. Such a shame. I couldn't even get a \"have a nice day\" I hope her day gets better. 

I also ordered a ginger shot and I just left due to bad energy.

At least my juice is delicious and lots of ginger was added."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I was really excited to try the açaí bowls. I got here are 7:20am and they open at 7am. I ordered the açaí banana berry and the lady informs me that they are out of bananas.... what? They have been open for 20 minutes and are already out??? Well I guess the delivery didn't come in... but still very disappointing- I know many other places would run to the grocery store near by and get some bananas until the delivery arrived but I guess not this place. I still paid $8+ for the bowl because I wanted to try it.  When I got the bowl- it had very little fruit on top- I thought that they would compensate by adding some extra strawberries or blueberries because of the lack of bananas but again- nope. Pretty disappointed and I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Overly priced for watered down product. Acai bowls have too much ice giving them a watered down taste and cost over ten dollars. The smoothies are ice based as well. Super boring. Healthy I guess."}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming staff! They offered me plenty off suggestions! Great place to come to for a healthy drink or acai bowl! Definitely will be returning :)"}
{"text":"I SO wish we had one of these in Orlando!! Amazing juices, acai bowls, and I can't wait to try their dairy free ice cream at some point during my stay!! They even have one day juice cleanses already packed up and ready to go out the door. Come to Florida please :) :)"}
{"text":"I love the açaí bowls here as well as the juices but after today's visit, I'm not so sure the wait is worth it. I placed an online order and had to wait over 40 minutes for it. People that came in and ordered in store after I'd been waiting for 20 minutes received their items before me. I get that things can be busy, but I think there needs to be more than two people working on a busy Saturday morning."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times since moving into the area. They are in the Sprouts/FedEx plaza. There are a lot of hot/cold drink places to visit in the complex but I think this place is worth a visit. It's a chain but I've never been to any other locations. They have a points system you can participate in via their app. There's info on their website & instore. I have ordered the beet juice,  the green detox, and the acai bowl. All have been freshly made, savory delicious taste and they make me feel GOOD! The green detox took about an hour to work, so keep that in mind... I'd hate to have been somewhere without a bathroom! The prices are decent and the restaurant is clean. There are only a few chairs/tables to sit at while you wait for your drink to be prepared. You can order ahead. I haven't been into the bathroom yet to report on it's cleanliness. The only thing I wish was that they used organic veggies. I would pay more for that."}
{"text":"Love the Acai bowls! Always fresh, always clean! Friendly, knowledge staff!
Enjoy time with friends and family. Kids love the fresh, fruity and nutritious taste of the mango Acai bowl. Love the Gluten free granola!"}
{"text":"Had the peanut butter acai bowl- it's amazing!!!!! So fresh and perfect post hike food. This place rocks."}
{"text":"This place is always great. I love that they have  Rocky mountain factory here also.

 So many things to do at the Odyssey complex."}
{"text":"First yelp review ever!
I got to say I really enjoy coming to this location. The employees there are so nice, personable and have great customer service skills. I always use the mobile app and every time I get there my orders are always ready. They always remember my name and really make it a personal experience. This location is   also well-maintained and very clean! Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"The PB acai bowl is one of the best things I've ever had. I'm afraid to try anything else because I don't think it can be topped! Also they play good music and have cool photography inside. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few different nekters and they were all super delicious! This one was kind of disappointing.. The past 2 times I've been there the pb acai bowl was missing something.. They definitely skimped on the peanut butter... And one of my favorite parts about the bowl is how pretty they usually make it, and unfortunately they've been making it kind of not so pretty.. Service is great though!"}
{"text":"Beware!!!! The ginger shots lately have been diluted w either lime, lemon or other stuff.. I'm really disappointed. I've had their ginger shots before but the last 5 times was disappointing. $3 a shot. I think I'll make my own from now on."}
{"text":"I love this place! The juices are so healthy and taste AMAZING. The staff is always so friendly and the location is always very clean and staff always wears gloves.  One day I called a few minutes before they were closing and was on my way, they made my juice and had it ready for me ad soon as I got there, so nice!!! Would go everyday if I could and will continue to come back. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Very, very tasty juices. I ordered one of the green juices with tons of kale and found it delicious. It's not cheap - $6 or so for a small is nothing to laugh at - but the ingredients appear to be high quality.

I had to knock it down one star because of price (though it's not insanely overpriced or anything) and because it took nearly 10 minutes to make my juice. There wasn't a line, so I'm not sure what the hold-up was."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time today and I'm already thinking about going back tomorrow.  I explained to the very friendly and knowledgable manager that it was my first time and she explained everything to me. I decided on the Tropical Cooler and it was amazing!!  The first sip was unbelievable! The perfect blend of flavors and texture was amazing! I already felt like I was doing my body good by drinking this smoothie. I will be back tomorrow and I have a feeling that my punch card will be filling up soon."}
{"text":"Everything I've had on the menu has been really good , quite addicting , especially when you work 1 minute away ! Everything is fresh , clean establishment ...the wait for your order can be long at times so I've learned to order and pay on line , then it's ready when I get there .
It would also be nice if they had a loyalty punch card for frequent customers ."}
{"text":"The açaí bowl is hands down the worst I've ever had. Zero flavor. It was like I was eating blended water with fruit on top. One star for the ripe banana in the bowl. Otherwise fruit was also tasteless."}
{"text":"This is my go to juice bar.  Although I love Whole Foods, the price here is a lot better deal.  I wish Nekter had a few more options for their juices, but otherwise a solid juice bar with a really nice product."}
{"text":"I came here with a few girls (including Akemi H.) to grab a snack during lunch time of our retreat. This place is a bit small so about 9 or 10 of us pretty much filled the seating area already. 

I got the Chocolate Dream smoothie.. to be honest.. I didn't like it at first few sips then the taste got better so I ended up liking it. It wasn't your typical Chocolate smoothie where it's sweet and all that sugary taste. I also got their Chocolate Covered Banana snack... there were good, chocolatey, chewy and a great snack.

I got to try Akemi H.'s PB Bowl and it was delish! I'm going to get that whenever we go back to a Nekter Juice Bar location.

One of the girls got these Vanilla grab n go protein drinks from the shelf.. I tried it.. it was not cat-approved but I'm pretty sure other people like them though :)"}
{"text":"I have visited this location many times in month that I have lived I Scottsdale and every time that I have asked the staff to add something to a drink it has been poorly executed. My last visit I asked for pea protein to be added to my drink. The powder was thrown in after the drink was mixed so the top of my drink was half pea powder and half pea protein foam that had the consistency of half mixed pancake batter. I love the idea of Nekter but this location is sub par."}
{"text":"First visit today and enjoyed the green drink!  Makes me want to open my own juice bar in Saint Louis!  :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff is so friendly, very clean and the prices are not outrages like other juice bars. I am obsessed with the Toxin Flush. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"I love Nekter!  Delicious and healthy smoothies, juices and more!  My favorites are Toxin Flush juice, Popeye's Acai smoothie, and Acai Peanut Butter Bowl.  Sign up for their app to get discounts from time to time.  I could go here every single day and be happy!"}
{"text":"I am so bummed to give this place a 2 star review, but they need help. It was a busy day and for part of my wait there was only 1 employee, finally another one showed up and smelled like  cigarettess. I ordered a small smoothie and even though i was first in line, my beverage came out last, i even had to ask if they had lost my order. I watched the employee use the restroom and then i went in the restroom and it was a disaster. The paper towels were not in the dispenser but sitting on the toilet tank. Why wouldnt the employee clean up the restroom? I wont be returning."}
{"text":"Nekter is my first choice for healthy smoothies! Prices are fairly reasonable compared to other small smoothie shops (like $6.25 for regular size). I love the pitaya smoothie, delicious and such a bright purple color. Employees are friendly and cool. If they had a drive thru it'd be perfect."}
{"text":"A very fresh and zen like place to get fruit juices, smoothies and acai bowls ... Clean and colorful place :) I go there once a week for detox and getting my share of fruits and veggies ... The blush and banana burst are my favorites.  ..............................."}
{"text":"I love the Nekter franchise, and this location didn't disappoint! The store itself was clean and had lots of fresh fruit and vegetables on display.

My açai banana berry bowl was smooth and refreshing, just what I was looking for on a hot Phoenix day! They also had a good balance of açai to granola. 

I would definitely recommend a Nekter bowl for a healthy, cold snack!"}
{"text":"Having moved here from Los Angeles and being addicted to green juices and going through withdrawal from my usual juice joint Pressed Juicery, I was looking for a place to fill that void and Nekter def fit the bill. The interior is adorable and very organic, the only thing I didn't like was that they have fruits and veggies displayed and they are plastic, kinda takes away from that whole fresh/healthy and organic feel. 
They have a pretty wide assortment of fresh
Juices and healthy snacks. I got the greenie, which I loved. It was pretty pricey though, more than I am used to paying."}
{"text":"Always greeted with a smile
Excellent ACAI bowls 
I love the energy shots and getting served with a smile"}
{"text":"Visited this store yesterday 4/7/2018 at 5:30-5:50pm  
And I'm not impressed at all...
The bathroom was  a wreck (toilet paper everywhere with a dirty Urine incrusted toilet ) and the employees where spaced(as in unwilling to help and very distracted with their own conversation)
The white blond haired cashier charged the person in front of me their items plus mine(without asking if we where together of corse) Thank god she was a friend of mine or it would have apparently been a problem sense she shrugged at both of us as said \"I thought you two where together ?\" And never even offered to refund so I could pay for my drink , instead after almost 20 seconds of awkward stares she said\"sorry it's already paid for\" then basically shoved me off to the side by trying to help the next customer instead of dealing with the problem at hand. then she quickly vanished to the back room to talk with her coworker, Which seemed to be more important then the actual customers that have been charged incorrectly. 
When my friends drink was finally done the young african American girl slid the drink down and was very rude/snappy about it when my friend went to go get it. She definitely needs an attitude check. 
(The Only reason I gave it two stars was because the products are actually tasty and well priced) 
Proper Communication (WITH customers) and the ability to Handel a situation that was as simple as refund should be retaught to that cashier sense she obviously didn't do it well this time. 



This is the first negative yelp review I've ever made and hopefully the last ! 
I usually keep my mouth shut sense I've worked in the food industry for 5 years so I tend to understand food workers but these two girls straight up ruined the whole experience and I will never visit that location again ! (If their reading this I bet their happy to hear that I will never return due to me making this review.)"}
{"text":"The products always taste good, but this is the worst customer service I've ever experienced! From the manager, to all the employees, they were beyond rude. Had questions on products and they acted annoyed that I asked. Even when I asked for a drink carrier, they threw one across the counter and didn't say anything. After paying $25 for drink you'd think they'd be nicer. Throughly disappointed. 


Update: Manager never called me back to discuss review like they wanted."}
{"text":"I walked in and ordered a mango bowl. Take it home and there's no mango or pineapple. Bring it back and the guy says we don't have mangos. Well then why did u let me order 1? Make me something you do have. Half a*sed makes it and sends me on my way."}
{"text":"I give this 2 stars strictly for how good the juices, smoothies and acai bowls are. However, as far as customer service this place gets zero stars from me. It is extremely expensive for the quality of service you receive here. Now, I gave them several chances before I chose to write a review to see if they were perhaps just having an \"off\" day but improvement never happened. The 2 instances that stick out the most happened on 2 consecutive days. I went here with a friend to enjoy acai bowls, my friend has celiac therefor cannot have the regular oats on top. Well considering this was not a new thing to her, as normal, she specifies she needs gluten free oats on top. Long story short we watched them use the regular oats. When she notified them of there mistake, the woman very rudely said \"you're just going to have to wait a minute\" and went on to help other customers before addressing the issue. They re- made her bowl however all the sudden the 7$ of what she paid for ( a full bowl) now looked like less that half that. Now I understand this place is still pretty new to the Arizona market however the quality of service they are offering in the Scottsdale area is by far the WORST I have received at any place of business. If they can get their act together and learn how to treat their customers and speed up the process (considering it never took less than 15 minutes from the time I ordered until I actually got my order) I might consider a future review. Until then I would say to anyone going here, Make sure you have at least 45 mins to spare even if it is just a juice you are ordering, and make sure you pack your patience that day for some of the rudest people you will encounter!"}
{"text":"The best frozen acai bowl around. Friendly staff, great taste and lots of options ranging from acai bowls, juices, frozen smoothies and even turmeric and ginger shots. Easy parking is also a great convenience."}
{"text":"Love love the product. But the horrible experience with the staff one afternoon ruined it for me. My friend and I had stopped in for drinks the wait was long which is understandable, but the immaturity of the staff went beyond normal high school kids working a part time job. After waiting for our drinks while watching the boy, who was supposed to be making one of them goof off ..walking around..in the back room.. Around the register..we finally got one drink, we ask for the 2nd and were told we didn't have another I had to show my receipt, then told they were out of an ingredient for the drink. Even though they were making the very same drink for another customer. I got my money back from a now apologetic employee. The boy behind the counter then started to argue and act belligerent towards my friend and dropped the F bomb. She called the DM, who a couple weeks later sent her a gift card. I'm not one to write reviews if something bad happens I move on but the one and only time my friend returned there the boy that swore at her was still working there . I will say that I have saved money over the last few months since that happened by buying my own juicer."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious with tons of good options between bowls, smoothies and juices! I love that I found this place and it's so close to home! The only complaint I have is how they close so early... We love to come here after the gym for some protein and they close at 7 on a Friday night.. Other then that this place is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Absolutely longest wait for 1 drink! 25 minutes!!!!!!! Pathetic and never again will I come to this location!!"}
{"text":"Ugh I love this place it's so good!! I feel fantastic after coming here if you are around one make sure you stop in!"}
{"text":"The girls were awesome that worked here today. I accidentally asked the girl for a greenie and forgot to tell her light apple. She was kind enough to remake it for me. They only had 2 girls working and were so busy on this Sunday. Those girls worked their butts off today!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I love Nekter.  And I intensely dislike leaving bad reviews.  However, today was my fourth or fifth time at this location and I won't return. Extremely slow service every single time. Today, there were two people working. They were very clearly frustrated at how busy it was and how understaffed they were. I heard one of the employees complaining about how he was going to be late for work and saw him throw his cell phone down in frustration. He rushed to make my drink, which I waited for about 15 minutes to receive, and he added way too much ice so it tastes terrible. I would have asked him to fix it, but there were 10 people in line and five other people waiting for their orders.  They are opening one in North West Peoria in my neighborhood, and I hope they get that one right."}
{"text":"I'm not that super trendy juicing person at ALL, let me just say.  I often mock juicers, in fact.  however a friend suggested it to me after a rough weekend. :)    I ordered the Greenie and it was actually drinkable. Did I LOVE it? no  but it wasn't nearly as gross as I thought it would be.  I then a few days later ordered the Cure and liked it a bit better.  

I then got ambitious and tried the Advanced one day Cleanse.  Oh good lord no. I didn't like ANY of those juices at all, but again, I'm not one of those juicing people at all.  I need to eat!  I prefer their freshly made juices over the premade ones.

A friend laughed and agreed about the cleanse and suggested I try the Acai bowl. YUM!!  Actual food is my dealio!!  I can see me going regularly for a light healthy lunch or snack.. I just wish they had a frequent buyer program or something."}
{"text":"Service was really good and the place itself was super hipster and nice! Not sure if it was an off day, but the acai bowls themselves were really terrible. The bases were so runny and not flavored well, and toppings were extremely skimpy. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm not into the green juice movement but I LOVE the Acai bowls here! I have a major sweet tooth and the PB Bowl is amazing. Seems a little pricey but the bowl is huge and VERY filling, I couldn't even finish the whole thing if I tried! Yummy, healthy and filling is a definite win in my book!!"}
{"text":"So today my sister and I both went here to get a smoothie for the first time, I mean who can ruin a smoothie? 

As we went to go order our smoothies the girl at the counter seemed to have a bit of an attitude problem. The 'I don't want to be here right now' attitude...so that was uncalled for. 

Anyways, I got the mango delight and my sister got an acai spinach smoothie. Both of our smoothies were warm, I'm not a fan of warm smoothies. I would rather have a cold smoothie, that's just my preference. I didn't know they would be warm. 

So the flavor for mine was okay, I honestly felt like it was lacking flavor but I could drink it nonetheless. My sisters had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. I have been to healthy juice bars like this one many times before along side my family actually owning one at one point and I have never not liked a smoothie! This is the first smoothie I actually didn't like. 

Long story short, at this specific juice bar you can expect attitude that you didn't ask for, very tasteless smoothies, and to wait a long time for your simple smoothie. 

The only good thing about this place was the price. Either way I feel I wasted my money. I would've been open to coming back and trying something else but the attitude was a turn off. 

I will definitely pass and stick to Kaleidoscope juice!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was super excited to try this place as I love smoothies, but was disappointed upon leaving. I have three complaints: 1. Ingredient shortage. I checked out the menu prior to arriving and wanted to try the Pink Flamingo smoothie. Unfortunately, the location was out of pitaya. So then I went for the orange crush, but was told they were out of frozen strawberry so I substituted with frozen pineapple. I showed up in a Saturday morning around 9 am. Why were they out of everything ?? 2. Unimpressive flavor. I had to substitute the frozen strawberry for frozen pineapple in the orange crush, so that may have affected the flavor, but it basically tasted like glorified orange juice. Nothing special. 3. The price. I paid about $10 for my smoothie after adding a little tip for the employees making my drink. I think it's $8 or $9 otherwise. Even without the tip, that's way too much for a mediocre smoothie. This place is just trendy and overhyped, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Nice place. Everything looks clean and fresh. A little hard to fine but it is sandwiched between Jimmy John's and five guys burgers. A little bit of a wait but worth it for healthy options. 
The fresh juices and bowls are priced reasonably.
Be sure to ask for 'light ice' they got a little heavy handed with it on the drinks I ordered."}
{"text":"I love Nekter, it's one of my favorite juice bars, though I go for the acai bowls and smoothies. It isn't cheap, but the smoothes and acai are the best!"}
{"text":"Nice local juice bar/smoothie bar. They actually tell you all of the ingredients in their smoothies (unlike places like Jamba). They've got everything from super green healthy juices, to sweeter juices, to mango smoothies to date smoothies to acai bowls with granola and fruit on top. You can get drinks to order or choose an already bottles juice from their case. My favorite is their \"date nut\" smoothies, which is made with homemade vanilla cashew milk, dates and nutmeg. Yum"}
{"text":"I Love this place!! The Manager Kori and all the staff are Great!! Everything is very fresh and the smoothies are wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"I Love this Store-The Date Nut Smoothie is wonderful!! And The manager Kaci plus all the other employees are great too!! I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for a nice refreshing juice. Gives you energy and fills you up! Love this place!"}
{"text":"8:56 PM. You can make me a smoothie in 3 freaking minutes. They deliberately hid as I walked up. I saw you bro."}
{"text":"This place is always amazing and the employees there are super helpful! Cameron was great answered all questions I had and was fast!"}
{"text":"I love this place. But if they get your order wrong and you try to return it, they will not re make it for free. If I'm paying close to $10 for a drink I expect better service. Super disappointed in this specific location. 

***Revision: Upon writing this review Ava quickly responded to me privately and was so kind and accommodating in helping resolve the issue and helping to make sure it doesn't happen again. Very please me with their customer service."}
{"text":"I'm impressed. I was excited to see a new juice bar opening close to home, and couldn't wait to try it. My first visit was good, but I wasn't really feeling the juice's after-taste. I have had most of the ingredients in the \"greenie\", except for celery and parsley, so I figured that was overpowering the juice. 

My next visit I asked the counter person, and he suggested making my own juice and leaving those 2 ingredients out. I was delighted to find out that 'build your own' is the same price, $4.75 for the small. That's a deal compared to the $7-$10 price elsewhere! 

Yes the juice is not organic, but many other juice bars aren't either, and still charge far more. The juice was perfect, great value, and no funky after-taste. :) I look forward to trying the acai bowls sometime."}
{"text":"Tempe Marketplace is one of our favorite hangouts any time of year. A couple of the restaurants we've tried there are exceptional, however most of the eateries, although good, are of the fast food or gastropub variety you typically find at a mall. Most of the time we're in the mood for something a little healthier, especially when it comes to dessert, so we appreciate having this restaurant available.

My girlfriend and I shared a Mango Acai Bowl with Whey Protein added, the portion size of which was plenty for the two of us.

The Acai bowls consist primarily of a fruit sorbet with various toppings. The mango bowl was topped with coconut flakes, granola, and sliced banana.

All of the ingredients tasted nutritious and delicious, the sorbet was smooth, refreshing, and not too sweet, and the fruit was fresh. The quality of the toppings was very good and they complimented the sorbet nicely. The flavor of the mango did not come through as much as I would have liked as a result of the berries that were also blended into the sorbet, but that didn't detract in any way from the overall flavor.

The service was prompt and courteous and the prices are reasonable for a mall restaurant. We both agreed that it's nice to have a healthy alternative for a snack when we're out at the Tempe Marketplace and I expect we'll be stopping here regularly.

{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars because I honestly love just about everything on their menu. However, when I went in today DURING my lunch break (meaning I was crunched for time) I had to wait over 10 min for my order when none of the employees were busy making anything else. All employees were standing around either talking or drinking their OWN smoothies while I waited for someone to notice my ticket. Probably won't be coming back to this location after this."}
{"text":"Anytime I try to call this location to place an order it takes forever for them to answer the phone. When they do answer, I place an order for pick up because I go on my short lunch break. Today I showed up at the time I said I would to pick up my bowl and they forgot to make it. The reason I called ahead is because I don't have time to wait. After it was made and I walked back to work I didn't even have time to eat. The only reason I give 2 stars instead of 1 is because I do love Nekter in general and all of their juices and smoothies are delicious. I just really struggle with the service and long wait times at this location."}
{"text":"the smoothie tasted good, but the place wreaked of chlorine so bad that our eyes were burning. They really need to wait until the store is closed before breaking out toxic chemicals to clean up."}
{"text":"They are always very friendly. Their juices/smoothies are pricey, but I'm obsessed with their bottled \"Skinny Lemonade\" with activated Charcoal. It's amazing. We went in their Saturday to get some and ended up with some fresh smoothies that were really good! I enjoy the service here and the products very much!"}
{"text":"I love their smoothies and bowls so I thought I would try one of their juice cleanses. After 1 day I decided there was no way I could do 2 more. The girl who worked their gladly returned all of my juice and gave me my money back with out any hassle. While I won't be going back for anymore juices I will definitely return for an acai bowl and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Not too bad. I enjoyed the atmosphere and setup. Tried a few things. Highly recommend the toxin cleanse with ice. Hope this place stays around for a while."}
{"text":"This juice bar offers to-go items, acai bowls, smoothies and juices. I've been so impressed by the environment and quality of Nekter's locations.

The bar itself is decorated appropriately and creates a calming coffee-shop feel.
You can usually see the associates making your order, which is reassuring that you're receiving quality products. The ladies at this location are friendly, but not overwhelming and are helpful if you have questions.

The store even offers recommendations for first-timers and the ability to create your own item.

As others have noted, it can be a little slow at times due to the capacity and the process. However, I don't mind waiting at all for a smoothie that I can watch be blended from scratch. Although a little pricey, totally worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"We decided to venture to Phoenix today for some breakfast and one of our favorite places and noticed Nekter next door and had to check it out. So glad we did. Cute set up inside with a couch and chairs or high table tops. There were quite a few people a head of us which gave us tome to decide what we wanted. The Açaí bowls looked to die for and if I hadn't already ate a big breakfast I would've gotten that. My daughter and I both decide on the skinny colada smoothie. It comes with  coconut water and sweet pineapple blended with creamy housemade cashew milk and a touch of agave nectar. We were looking st their cups for purchase and an employee let us know if we bought one they could fill it and a get a 16oz drink as well. Even with it being busy we had our drinks within about five minutes. It was so good and refreshing on such a hot Arizona day! I wish we had one on my side of town I'd be there every day ha ha. I loved the tiny pieces of fruit from being blended and texture was great. Cute cups, cute store and good service."}
{"text":"I was really happy to find this spot ! I have a hard time finding the time to use my juicer so I checked this spot out . I was impressed the juiced my detox right in front of me and it tasted great !"}
{"text":"Great juices at reasonable prices. Good, but not always great customer service. Unsure if they use any organic fruits & veggies. Minus one star because they don't allow phone-in orders."}
{"text":"Never going back again! Went to this location on mothers day to use their buy 1 get one free 1 coupon. My wife and I placed our order of 4 smoothies, (one for her, myself, and my parents who were visiting that weekend) the cashier scanned our coupon and gave us the total. Only one of the smoothies was free when we asked why she said that just how it is. We asked to just remove the two smoothies since the only reason we came in was for the deal. We were then told she would have to restart the order and we wouldn't be able to reuse the coupon. What kind of customer services is this. I can't receive  the discount I wanted the cashier knew we were using the buy 1 get 1 coupon and before scanning it said nothing to the fact it won't work twice in the same order and now I can't even change it. Never! Never again will I go back their. No amount of your $1 off coupons will bring me back. Not to mention on top of this the previous time I went in I had an allergic reaction to the smoothie they made me because they made the wrong smoothie which caused my throat and face to swell up. Avoid this place like the plague and find a better smoothie bar"}
{"text":"The staff is great here and the pink flamingo smoothie is amazing. I love the smell when walking
Into the doors and I highly recommend this juice bar if you're visiting Las Vegas or live in the summerlin area."}
{"text":"So I've waited a while to try Nekter, and meh ... It's alright. 

I swung by on my break one day in search of a good ol' green juice.

The store was definitely clean and bright. 

I tried the Toxin Flush with extra ginger. It was actually quite delicious and definitely soothed the GI distress, but I could get the same thing anywhere. 

The customer service is about what I'd expect for a chain; uninterested teenagers / college students. At least pretend to enjoy your job. 

Don't forget to use that $1 off check-in offer. $7+ beverages get pricey after a while . . . 

Also, as another reviewer noted: They don't use organic here. Boo. 

Maybe I'll give Nekter another try when I'm in a rush, but there's another local organic place down the road in Ahwatukee I prefer for my juices with friendlier (basic) customer service."}
{"text":"I love a good juice bar and it was spot on. Clean, friendly, tasty, and when I had questions she had answers. Great healthy choice!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and I loved it! I tried the mango acai bowl and has now become one of my favorites! I was so pleased with the flavors and the freshness that I can't wait to try out the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"We went in for their free Skoop vegan, ice cream? Not really ice cream. I got chocolate with strawberries, blueberries and vegan chocolate chips. My daughter got chocolate with vegan chocolate chips. I do wish there were more fruit options to choose from for toppings. Will definitely try the vanilla option.

If you had told me my new tasty treat was vegan I would have called you a liar. So rich and creamy. Reminds me of chocolate mousse. We also got a vegan double chocolate chip muffin and a vegan chocolate mint bar. Both very good. 

You can order ahead on their mobile app and skip the line.

We will defitinely be back. Super excited to take my lactose friends here. So many vegan treats."}
{"text":"The staff is always super courteous. The place itself is clean and inviting. They offer a variety of juices, smoothies, and acai bowls. I'm only had the juice, but each one has been wonderful. This is a regular place for me when I'm doing a juice fast. 

Because they are busy, they can get backed up. Often I'm told it will be 10-15min when they are busy. Personally, I have no issue with this, but some might. Could they benefit from another juicer and more staff? Maybe, but I don't know where you would put it, its a rather small store, but I feel it adds to the charm. 

My only complaint is they don't have pineapple for juicing. Maybe its just me, but I kinda think its a swing and a miss. 

Plus at 8.50 for a 32oz juice, you can't go wrong. Sure, I can juice at home for way less (and I do), but lets face it, I'm not coming here when I can/feel like juicing at home."}
{"text":"This place is good but not good enough for how much they charge... After tax, I'm paying $12 for an açaí bowl? C'mon...Probably cost $2-3 to make."}
{"text":"Great place with amazing juices blends. Everything is blended with fresh ingredients and each recipe is for different healthy effects and outcomes. Detox, weight loss, energy, protein etc. I'm not friendly m the area but people I know swear by this place for their healthy life style. Friendly and helpful staff will make first timers feel welcome. Like me, you'll get hooked. I can wait to come back."}
{"text":"I love nekter juice bar. The Acai bowls and smoothies are super delicious and a great healthy alternative. The staff at this location are friendly, courteous and quick with orders. I am a repeat customer 10x over and will continue to be..."}
{"text":"I really appreciate a good wholesome juice experience, Nékter fits the bill (pun intended, it is a bit pricey).  A new shop just opened up in Glendale which is closer than the others to me but still not close enough, not their fault therefore holds no weight in terms of review.  Nékter is consistent in quality from franchise to franchise so far, I hope this trend continues for reliability. I ordered a Tropical cooler on a Monday in a small and Wednesday upgraded to a large cause it was really refreshing and Yum!  I traveled from 35th ave and Greenway to 67th ave and the 101 during a lunch break, took up my whole break but was worth it.  I also enjoy their peanut butter Açaí bowls which usually last me a couple of days, its pretty rich cause of the peanut butter. The new spake is clean and staff are helpful and friendly, good vibes for sure."}
{"text":"Juices are really good and good for you. The reason I do not rate higher is because the service time to get your drink has always been long and as I write this we have waited nearly 15 minutes for two ginger shots with a total of two people in front of us. I understand the process is lengthy but the turn around time has gotten worse not better over the last several months . That's my opinion. I'll return but it is a constant headache I now expect going in"}
{"text":"I attended a soirée, last night, and although I managed to avoid the adult libations except for a sip of limoncello. I pigged out on all the delicious Hors d'oeuvre, cheeses, desserts, and crudites at the party.  
Feeling a little bloated, instead of eating a huge breakfast this morning; I decided to start my day with a bowl of superfood Acai bowl, and a glass of toxic flush instead. 
You hear a lot about the supposed health benefits of a cleanse or detox, designed to eliminate toxins from our body.  There are claims, but not sure if they are entirely valid since they are low in protein. But the good thing is there is benefit from increased intake of vitamins and minerals either naturally from juiced fruits and veggies or supplemented from drinks. I was feeling a little sluggish this morning, so the girl behind the counter suggested the Toxic flush. I decided to try it, and I must say it was pretty good. It also actually made me full, so I took the Acai bowl to go.  The toxic flush juice has an apple, spinach, parsley, lemon and ginger which I can probably make at home."}
{"text":"A very tasty selection of bowls, smoothies and juices.

The store is simple but nicely decorated in a natural earthy way. 

The staff are friendly and efficient! 

Highly recommend"}
{"text":"The Acai Banana Berry Bowl is good, fresh, reasonably priced, and SO filling! I went for a quick breakfast during a weekend in Phoenix and was pleasantly surprised. The store itself is easy to pass by since it's wedged into a plaza, but it's worth the go. Inside is clean and and bright, and service is pretty efficient.

I also tried the Pink Flamingo smoothie, which is pretty good as well. Very fruity and berry-y. Almosttt a little over-the-top sweet, but still filling and delicious like the bowls."}
{"text":"This place is like Jamba Juice on steroids.  All natural ingredients and they even have pre-made cleanses.  I could use me a cleanse.  I had the new mango and the misses had the pink flamingo.  Both were absolutely spectacular."}
{"text":"Good, a little slow. Somewhat pricey but good for when you don't have time to juice at home."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed. The restaurant was hip and clean, and the staff were friendly but the options were few and I am not sure some of the colors their smoothies come in are found anywhere in nature (eg the \"pepto pink\" berry concoction I tried).   For the cost, I expected more I guess."}
{"text":"I love there green apple detox with extra ginger. I find myself trying other juice places to compare to this but I haven't found anything better. I like my juices more veggie tasting & nektar def has it. I wish they had one closer to me in Chandler."}
{"text":"Inspiring people like myself to stay healthy my friends or as the most interesting man in the world would say....\"Stay thirsty my friends.\"?"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times already and I keep HOPING that my green juice (the Sublime) that I always get will not always be overpowered with bitterness...yuck! And I am a green juice freak. There should always be a perfect balance so that you do not end up with either an aftertaste of grass or lemons. All 3 times it has been way to bitter. They need to work on their ratios. On the plus side their juices for sale on the shelf are pretty good. The strawberry slimmer is awesome. Cute shirts and tumblers to. Pretty decent service."}
{"text":"I'm still a skeptic that açaí bowls are actually good for you, but either way I love them. I originally found Nekter first in Phoenix and was happy a location opened up a little closer to me at Downtown Summerlin. This one is located right next to Macy's and has lots of pressed juices, bowls and smoothies on their menu.

My most recent visit I had the Banana Berry Bowl. It's packed with fruit on top and it a very good size portion. Everything tasted very fresh & well made. It also was super quick, only about a 5 minute wait.

I would certainly come back here again. I highly recommend giving the bowls a try!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood and craving a good, healthy juice bar. This was my first time ever checking out a Nekter and I must say I loved it. 

I ended up going with the little beet juice and a mango acai bowl. I must say both were incredible. The juice flavors blended together very well, not too sweet and not too grassy tasting like some juices can tend to be. The mango acai bowl though, wow, honestly so good! I could probably eat this on the daily. Everything in the bowl was so fresh and it was super filling.

I'm sure I will be back again to try more juices and bowls. A perfect healthy & tasty option!"}
{"text":"I want to love this Nekkter over the one in Downtown summerlin, solely because the parking is better, but after three weeks now of trying I just have to give up. 
Three weeks ago, my son and I stopped in hoping to get, well, juice. There were no grab and go options made and the girl working (who was super nice!) told us it would be a long wait because she was behind on orders. A week later we came back. Again, no grab and go. This time, they were only accepting cash orders. After we ran down to the ATM, my son ordered a health nut and it was just kind of....gross. I can't quite explain what was wrong with it, but he ended up throwing it away. Having learned nothing, I went back today to pick up a cleanse. The two kids working were, again, really nice. But there was no juice made. They told me I needed to order it a few days in advance (?). 
So I headed over to the DTS location where a 3 day cleanse was prepped and waiting. I ordered health nuts for my kids again and this time they were delicious. 
As nice as the kids working are and as convenient as the parking is, it seems impossible to actually get what you want from this location. I'll be braving DTS from now on."}
{"text":"Every time I go into that store the staff is always very pleasant and so friendly.  Always willing to help.   They are very nice and very professional.  Great staff.  Good drinks and awesome service.   Great customer service."}
{"text":"After my review, I received a very nice reply from the manager offering to send me a gift card. I used that gift card to go back. It was a totally different experience, the staff was friendly and attentive. The smoothie I got was delicious and exactly what I expected from the menu description. Thank you! I'll be back."}
{"text":"I do love this place. Truly. But I'm not in love with their version of the Açaí bowls. Anyhoots! That's not to say I don't love their juices because I do!"}
{"text":"I never thought I would cheat on my other juice bar but alas I have! Nekter is so good! The drinks aren't as expensive as most juice bars in Scottsdale. I got the Sublime for my inaugural visit and the PB Acai bowl ... Yum!!"}
{"text":"Super clean cute atmosphere, pleasant staff, yummy smoothies!!! Love ginger and love this strip mall and area!!!"}
{"text":"This is right next door to my work. Great healthy alternative for a snack or a drink. My favorite is the buzz and the toxin flush.... Both I add extra ginger. The acai bowls and the pitaya bowl are also delicious, and very filling. Be forewarned, they are very busy, and since all these items are made to order.... You may have to wait a while. However, I've never had to wait more than 15mins even when its packed."}
{"text":"My favorite by far is the toxin juice. They're all natural and at times I add protein to make it a meal replacement"}
{"text":"I might update this review if/when I actually get my smoothie. We've been sitting here for 20 minutes waiting.... and waiting... no customer service apologizing for the wait time... they just keep telling us \"it's coming.\" If we could get our $12 back we would walk out. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I just walked in really looking forward to trying some overpriced juice! Hey, if it's as delicious as people say I'll try! Waited 5 minutes for anyone who worked there to show up in front. I guess nobody works at the Dana Park location? I ended up leaving. Lame. My I suggest a service bell? Lol!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The guy that's always there is extremely friendly. Always says hi, asks my name and says bye using my name! They put a lot of work into their products and each thing they make is made special it seems like! I especially recommend the Acai Berry banana bowl! :)"}
{"text":"Nekter is located just outside the east entrance of Macy's in DTS. They have several different drinks that they offer on the menu. You can also pick the ingredients yourself for your drink. I usually go with the carrot, Apple, and ginger. Everything tastes fresh here and the place appears to be very clean. It is a bit pricey, but it is in DTS. Definitely stop by if your in the neighborhood. You will enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I usually go all the way near down town to get my acai bowl fix and Im so glad this place opened up so close to home. I had the pitaya bowl and it was literally perfect. I could swear by it. 

The place is very clean and organized plus the staff is so friendly and know how to hold a great conversation.  Love the vibes of this place. Will definitely be making this a regular stop for me!"}
{"text":"Been to this location a few times already.  Every time I go the staff is very kind.  The manager Hannah goes out of her way for customer service.  I am a fan of their juice prices.  The Advance Cleanse if a nice way to start off the week."}
{"text":"I've been in here twice now. The first time I was one of only a few customers so the wait time was minimal. I ordered two different juices--The Buzz and the Toxin Flush-- because I really like fresh juice and I'd been excited to try this place. First of all, I don't get why everyone is raving about the customer service. Both times I've been in it's been standard high school kids clearly working a part-time job. I say \"clearly\" because it's obvious they're just going through the motions; I overheard a woman ask a question about the pricing in the to-go case and the girl behind the counter sort of shrugged. And on my first visit the guy who rang me up asked, \"Do you want ice?\" I told him no. \"Are you sure?\" He asked. \"It's going to come out warm.\" Now maybe they get a lot of complaints from people who aren't familiar with how juicing works so they feel obligated to ask that question, but the way he said it and his expression... It was such a turn off. Like he was warning me what I just ordered was going to be gross. 

Both of those juices were fine. They tasted pretty similar to one another. I'd give each one a B. The second time I went in, the place was packed. I ordered an acai berry bowl and a Greenie juice, both to go. So the acai bowl came out about ten minutes later (all the reviews mentioning long wait times are correct) but the juice took another ten minutes. Meanwhile this frozen acai bowl is just sitting there in front of me, melting under its to-go lid. When I finally got the juice and got everything back to my car, I had a chance to taste the Greenie... And it was gross. Barely palatable. Bitter and sharp, not at all what I was expecting-- and I drink a lot of greens. The acai bowl was fine, the fruit was fresh and it all tasted good. I don't know that I need another one. 

Ultimately I think I'll stick with The Chopshop or Whole Foods for juice. More customer service attention, faster (by far) and tastier. If you're looking for a good green juice, I recommend Chopshop's Kale Cleanse or the Chandler Garden at Whole Foods."}
{"text":"This place has an excellent menu and the chia cups are so delicious! Everyone is very friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"The health nut drink is awesome. Perfect for protein lovers. The 24oz is 660 calories and the 16oz is 440."}
{"text":"It was a blistering hot day and I was looking for some hydrating refreshment. I browsed through the menu here and decided on The Greenie since it was their signature drink and it sounded like \"jugo verde\" (Green juice) that I have had in Mexico and in Hispanic markets like Los Altos which has a refreshing clean flavor, lightly sweet. 

Unfortunately, it doesn't taste anything like jugo verde. It tasted like a salad threw up in a cup. There was a weird hint of sour flavor at the end of my sip and a strong flavor of celery. I think if you like V8 type juices this is your drink, but I could only take a sip and I was done. If this is their signature drink I'm not too sure I want to try other ones. 

Service was fast and friendly.

Overall, meh."}
{"text":"I am officially addicted to this place! I normally don't like kale but the popeye acai smoothie is amazing. It's delicious and it fills me up. The people who work here are really nice and the drinks come out pretty fast."}
{"text":"It tends to get really busy on Saturday mornings and afternoons so an easy call ahead and pick-up is perfect! I love the new grapefruit reboot, before that I just went for the jugular on the large liver cleanse. Staff is always friendly and helpful. Thanks for taking care of the local juicers!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! They have super yummy juices and breakfast bowls! The staff is always friendly and your order is ready very quickly! It's so nice to have a healthier option than fast food for breakfast or lunch. If you've never been to Nekter, I highly recommend you try it out!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The smoothies are 100% real Fruit, you can see them making your oder right in-front of you, they were very friendly and provided an Outstanding Customer service! Big thanks to the staff worker Joel M. For helping me figure out what was right for me!"}
{"text":"I was just here today and the gal and guy who worked here were sweet. Especially the tall, darker guy with green eyes- he had incredible customer service! He was very sweet and patient in remaking my smoothie. The first time it had tasted exactly as if the fruits were left in the freezer unwrapped for a long period of time."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after work and got the little beet and it was absolutely delicious. Super clean inside. Staff was friendly and attentive! And so cheap for such large drinks! No better way to get in your veggies. Your body will thank you"}
{"text":"I keep hearing about this place on the radio and gave it a shot. Right now it's by one get one free if you mention it prior to ordering.  Awesome selection and flavor, especially for me who is watching every calorie.  A must try!!!!"}
{"text":"Dear god, their green juices are overly sour and limey.... And they all taste the same. PASSSSSSSSSS...... !!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go!! I have tried almost all of the smoothies and some of the acai bowls. They are all very delicious! They are a little expensive though. Also, I tried a drink one time and couldn't take more than a couple sips of it, it had way too much ginger and was very potent. I just stick to the smoothies and I'm all good :)"}
{"text":"This place is great! I tried the acai mango bowl and it was delicious. I would love it a little tangier, so next time I'll try it with orange juice or something instead of coconut water! I'm not a fan of coconut flakes, and the worker let me substitute for strawberries and it was great! Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out with my hubby this morning after our morning workout. I have been dying to go in since it opened because it looked delicious and healthy! I got the Toxin Flush and my husband went for The Buzz. Both juices were amazing!  The prices were a little high, but for the freshness and quality of the juice, I would say it was expected. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because it took us 35 minutes to get our juices. If we had known it was going to take that long we definitely wouldn't have stopped in. The two girls working were doing their very best, but 2 people on staff was just clearly not enough. I think the manager here needs to better staff this location. It seemed like everyone was pouring in after morning workouts and wanting juices and bowls. I honestly felt so bad for those two girls. They were dealing with many irritated customers and it wasn't really their fault. 

Might go in again. But definitely not if there are other people in line and only 2 people working. Just a heads up!"}
{"text":"I was craving a smoothie while I was at the mall recently and found Nekter tucked away by the Macy's. I ordered a pink flamingo and a ginger shot (although I forgot to check in on yelp!), my mom ordered the summer special which is a watermelon cooler, and we shared a vegan brownie from the take-away case. 

The pink flamingo was really pretty and pretty tasty, it definitely took care of my smoothie craving, but I'm looking forward to trying a few different smoothies before I come back for a pink flamingo. 

The watermelon cooler was very flavorful and my mom really enjoyed it. It was also fun to get to watch them juice the watermelon, as the juicer is easily seen from the counter.

The vegan brownie we shared was super fudgy and delicious and I am definitely going to pick up another one of these next time we stop in. 

Overall, next time I'm back at the mall I'm definitely going to stop in, but I don't see myself making a trip especially to go to Nekter. Though I'd definitely recommend stopping in for a healthier sweet treat while you're out shopping."}
{"text":"Love this place for a cleanse. Recommend picking your own instead of their typical suggested cleanse bags, as you can save money that way. The original skinny lemonade is good; it's the master cleanse recipe, except made with agave nectar instead of maple syrup. The Tumeric skinny lemonade is my favorite; almost has an orange juice taste to it. Charcoal lemonade also a must try! Look forward to going back to try an acai bowl soon. Friendly staff and convenient location just off 101 next to Chipotle, Sandbar and Target."}
{"text":"Awesome juice here at a reasonable price! The greenie and Pink Flamingo are definitely my favorites"}
{"text":"Great product and consistent with the other Nektars I have been to. The staff does need some help, all the other locations I have been to staff was super friendly, awake and did not look annoyed with any questions I had. Manager needs to step up to the plate and correct this because I think this is a great addition to desert ridge and would hate to see it fail due to something as easy as customer service."}
{"text":"While the smoothies and food are delicious. I've come here several times and had to wait over 15 minutes for a smoothie. They are slammed in the mornings and need more help."}
{"text":"I took my sister to Nekter for the 1st time. Laurence, Cam & Lexi were at the counter. They were extremely informative & my sister loved her experience. 

What a great staff....."}
{"text":"I had such an amazing experience at Nekter in Tempe Marketplace! It was very clean and cute! Despite the large line my server Cameron was able to take my order and get it to me quickly and with a beautiful smile on her face! Very friendly and enjoyable experience. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Want a great energy boost definitely try the orange crush, very helpful staff that always have a smile on their face. :)

 Also great place to study outside and use your student discount!!"}
{"text":"How could you not love this place? It's friendly staff and super welcoming! Their menu is quite extensive and you can tell everything is FRESH!!!! I've had acai bowls world wide (I even run a Instagram account feature the best acai bowls) and this one TOPS IT!!! Way to go Nekter!!"}
{"text":"I stop by Nekter Juice Bar just to grab a quick little smoothie to start my day off service was great very friendly nice clean place with good music great lighting and a great service. The pink flamingo smoothie with pitaya was very tasty and you know at a reasonable price I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Upon entering, the establishment was very clean, good lighting, and positive environment. Very cute decor! The staff who rang us up, a young woman, could be a little bit friendlier, but overall the team was very energetic. Ordered the açai bowl with peanut butter and it was mind blowing! Definitely life-changing experience on my dietary needs!"}
{"text":"After a not so good experience and a bad review, the manager of the store called me and was super nice. He asked me to give it another try, so I went back today and he made me the same smoothie that I didn't like last time and it didn't taste like nothing I got the first time it was so much better and really really good !!! I would recommend this place and thank you for such good customer service.




Disgusting ! After I finished my PT I was recommended to try their smoothies. First of all the cashier didn't really care about what I wanted. 2nd the place where they made the smoothies look dirty... The girl making the smoothie had no gloves or a hat which really grossed me out. Finally when I got my smoothie it tasted like milk and not a smoothie. I said thanks to the girl which didn't even acknowledge it. Walked out and threw my 8.00 freakin \"smoothie\" away. Trust me if I wanted to drink milk I could do it for 2 dollars not 8. Waste of money and time. See you never again"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed this Juice Bar! Very affordable, and quality ingredients. Staff very accommodating. Love the fact I can build my own Juice also. Standouts for me was the ginger shot! Ginger with Apple - perfect balance - cleared foggy brain in seconds!
Will definitely visit again next time in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Love the services, very fast and friendly. The menu's option also quite creative and great! Love to go back and get healthy ;)"}
{"text":"I love the bowls and juices ... Although I've found it varies on the quality ( how much fruit/granola) is in the bowl based off of who is working ... For the price it always needs to be overflowing! It is some amazing stuff though !"}
{"text":"I'm obsessed--so many great veg options! Delicious smoothies, juices & bowls all perfect for summer here in the desert!! Two big thumbs up :)"}
{"text":"Very good service and drinks. I got the pink flamingo and it was amazing! Great place to grab a bite or a drink. Really good decor and staff overall!"}
{"text":"Cute little juice shop located here in The Trails Village Center. The staff was friendly and efficient. I had a green toxin flush and I did NOT care for it at all. Everybody has a different palate that's for sure. Maybe mine is just not that hip. lol

I did have a sip of my daughters Pink Flamingo and that was delicious. We grabbed some chilled drinks from their fridge, to ours,  to enjoy over the next few days. Charcoal lemonade, Super Food Protein Green- so harsh (yikes),and Skinny Lemonade Strawberry. Honestly, I didn't like any of them enough to re-buy them again. :(

If in the neighborhood I would stop in for a Pink Flamingo maybe, but unfortunately I will not go out of my way for one."}
{"text":"Got the Greenie and was VERY unimpressed! Tasted more like celery than anything else. With everything that is supposed to be in it I'm unsure why it tasted that way. Never again!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Omaha, Nebraska and wanted to start the day with something healthy. Had \"the greenie\" juice and it was delicious!!! Loved the atmosphere and the customer service was awesome. Thank you, I will be back later :)"}
{"text":"So my first açaí bowl ever and boy is the par set super high! I think i get a bowl almost daily. The ingredients are always fresh. I enjoy this being a normal in my life. I highly recommend the peanut butter infused bowl."}
{"text":"Good juice, poor service. I can't really blame the workers, they're young and inexperienced at service work, but I'm not sure why, on a two item order, one drink took 8 minutes, and the other took an additional 6. All the ingredients are prepped and ready to juice. I noticed two other couples dealing with split orders."}
{"text":"Okay - I gave this location another shot because I was in the area and desperate for a Date nut smoothie and my oh my am I glad I did! 

Ashley was FANTASTIC !! I walked in 3 mins before they closed and she was still so accommodating and pleasant! I would come here daily if she was working just because she made such a good impression on me, matter of fact, I'd hire this girl myself!"}
{"text":"Pretty good juice bar in downtown Summerlin.  Their acai bowls are packed and filling.  Their juices are great too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by while shopping at Tempe Marketplace. I have seen them over in Scottsdale before but never been in. I am admittedly not a \"health conscious\" diner. Had some time to kill while waiting for a movie so thought I'd check it out. The girls were extremely friendly and helped me out picking a smoothie since it was my first time (guess it was obvious). I tried a glowing pink smoothie appropriately named the pink flamingo. It was very delicious. I didn't even care how walking around sipping a pink drink as a grown man looked it was so good! Now I am excited to try some of their other stuff."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Nekter's and absolutely love them! My mother stays out in Mesa and while visiting her I saw one had just opened down the road! This new location is very nice and just like the others I have been to has great customer service."}
{"text":"Great place.  Only thing I wish that could be done is order an organic juice or smoothy.  You can order your cleanse as organic.  Some reviews have people complaining about the ready to go juices as having short expiration dates.  Keep in mind these are done fresh and nothing added to them.  They are not meant to have a long shelf life.  A great option and great acai bowls also."}
{"text":"Love the berry banana acai bowl !! Super nice staff and great atmosphere! Definitely give this place a try"}
{"text":"PB bowl is good too. But it becomes a little bland after a while. Couldn't finish it. I will be returning to the banana berry acai bowl next time."}
{"text":"Walked in, there was no one at the counter. Waited a few minutes and had to call to the back (because we could hear two kids talking), when finally a red head kid came to the counter to tell us that all the juicers were \"down\" for the night. I asked to clarify if they were down and he said they had to clean them all so they wouldn't make anymore juices. He would make smoothies and bowls for us though! So that makes no sense.  We were there 20 minutes before closing time. Asked when they stopped serving juice... He said 15 minutes before closing. -_- we walked out, came back in, and there was no one at the counter again. I could however hear him talking shit about me and the two people I brought in with me. Had to call back two more times before the same kid came out again to answer another question I had. I would not recommend this place unless you don't mind having poor service by a kid that will just lie to your face to get out of work early."}
{"text":"I cannot handle the heat anymore while shopping t Downtown Summerlin so I went ahead and checked Nekter Juice Bar!

The place is well lit, edgy and perfect hangout for teens. Lol. 
Ordered the pressed juice, little beet! It was refreshing, although I wished it was cooler. I also thought that the beet overpowered all the other elements when it was no longer cold, making it taste very earthy. 

Try this place while strolling at Downtown Summerlin!"}
{"text":"I've been ordering the same açaí mango bowl for a long time. Today, suddenly the bowl is different. The bowl had no flavor and no açaí even in it. I had them remake it and the same thing. I won't be returning. Very disappointed in the consistency of there bowls. Need to work on training the young employees better on making the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great pitaya bowls. Juices are mediocre. Staff is not pleasant"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always clean! The staff is great and their fruits and veggies always look and taste fresh. My favorite juice is the Toxin Flush sub green apple. They offer an app to gain points for future visits as well! This location is the best one in the valley :)"}
{"text":"I love the juices and smoothies here. Fresh ingredients and super friendly employees. I love stopping in for a tropical cooler, it is my favorite that they have. So delicious, nutritious, and refreshing. I also love that you can create your own juice if their blends don't strike your fancy."}
{"text":"So the dirty old men I work with like to tell me they go here for the yoga pants. I have to say that I've seen many yoga pants in here, but I guess I'm not old enough to have that low of standards. Mostly soccer moms with nothing else to do but put on workout clothes and go shopping as if that was the workout they dressed up for. And there were a lot of 60lb teenage girls who think they're fat. Lol... that's Scottsdale for you.

Now, the juices and smoothies and whatever else they serve... delicious. My wife craves these things and so do I. We'll actually probably go here right now...

Oh, and I don't know how they do it, but all of their juices/smoothies have ridiculously bright and neon like colors. It's crazy, my Jamba Juice never looked this cool! Just a weird observation both my wife and I had."}
{"text":"So I was fixing to go shopping when I spied across the parking lot, a sign with the word \"juice.\" As a firm believer that juice is good food, my conditioned response was to follow the sign just to see what it could be --

-- oh wait, here's Chompie's
cake, cookies, pie 
uhhh, snap out of it! --

I pulled myself away from Chompie's bakery section amazingly having resisted the temptation to buy a thick slice of cheesecake for $4.95. It turned out that the word \"juice\" belongs to Nekter Juice Bar where I spent that same $4.95 on a fresh 12 oz green juice.

The smell of freshly extracted fruits and veggies hit me when I first walked in and I stood there for some seconds with a stupid smile on my face. The cashier waited for me to come to my senses and place an order. After contemplating bitter or sweet, I went for sweet and chose apple as the base mixed with the greens. 

Happy choice. There was so much chlorophyll in that drink, I must have been photosynthesizing for the rest of the day.

The space is rather small, and I could see the juicers in the back. They work hard for the nutrition. No way would I be able to stand there and do it all day. It's a real workout. Forget going to Orange Theory (which is a few doors down), just get a job being a juicer.

The bar also sells smoothies and acai bowls for those who want something a little heavier."}
{"text":"First time at a Nekter. I ordered the Acai Mango bowl to go. It was good but it didn't have any mangos in it. It had bananas granola and coconut with honey drizzle and that was pretty much it. I would probably return for a smoothie since I live right behind this location. No one told me I'd get credit on an app though until I read a different yelp review on here I'll have to get the app!"}
{"text":"Raina(sp?) was amazing! I was unsure if a cleanse was right for me and she eased me into the process. She had a ton of knowledge and helped me pick what what right for me! When I arrived to pick up my cleanse they were packed for me in a cute insulated tote with my name for fast in and out. The special of the month is 99$ for 3 days cleanse. You can't beat that. Nor can u beat Raina's customer service!"}
{"text":"Nice location. Staff was extremely helpful. I asked the young lady at the counter if she knew the ingredients to an item and she wasn't sure so she took the initiative to go to the back and actually grabbed the box and brought it out to me so that we could read the ingredients together! I appreciated her going the extra mile without me even having to ask especially because I have a food allergy. The banana berry burst smoothie was okay. I'm not really that big into agave so I had them put just a little, but I should have also added peanut butter to give it more of a sweeter taste. The prices are kind of high but they offer really great ingredients and I don't mind. Needless to say this will be my go-to spot when I'm too lazy in the morning to make my own smoothie at home!"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy smoothie and juice options. Staff are very helpful. Juices, although pricey, are flavorful and healthy. Great to see a juice option at DTS!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Nektar. Fresh ingredients, great service, and is delicious. I do find most of their bowls taste similar even though they are very different on paper. The mango bowl doesn't have a hint of mango in it, otherwise I'd give it 5 stars. Either way, great spot."}
{"text":"Visited this location yesterday, split an acai bowl with my sister and left. I also grabbed a cold pressed ginger lemonade which one of the girls was nice enough to ground more ginger in for me. Bad news is that a plastic bag was in my sisters bowl and a few pieces of plastic in mine. Yep I said plastic. I think they must prebag the acai brick or something and some genius didn't take the plastic off before sticking it in blender...so we had to throw our bowls away...we were already home...ate about 1/3 of the bowl before I found my first plastic chunk but pretty sure I had already swallowed some...yuck"}
{"text":"Delicious! One of my favorite spots. Just make sure you go with enough time to spare cause there's always a line and they aren't the quickest... Be prepared for a wait. Also they should pre cut the fruit and veggies in the cups like Chopshop does. Much quicker."}
{"text":"Always good, always right. Love it for a healthy boost to start my day. The açaí bowls are really good, haven't tried the skoop ice cream yet but it looks good."}
{"text":"Normally I love Nekter it recently my experience wasn't so great. Three days ago I was diagnosed with celiac disease which means I can't eat gluten AKA wheat. Getting into the normal habit of not eating gluten is hard especially when you used to eat it every day. When they started making my acai bowl I remembered it came with granola. I was the only one in the store waiting on an order so I politely asked them to make it without granola assuming it wasn't made yet. They said sure but rolled there eyes. So they made a new one and I live in the desert ridge area so it's a three minute drive home. I got home and my acai bowl was completely melted, not pretty and no honey ok it. Of course I will go back because I love the place but they could have been a little nicer and maybe made the acai bowl better."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Nekter and i am OBSESSED! I have yet to order something that I don't like. The smoothies are delicious; the juices are refreshing and delicious. The Acai bowls are absolutely delicious! I just bought their 3 day juice cleanse and I am ecstatic to try it. My new found love for Nekter has motivated me to get healthy because healthy can be DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my peanut butter acai bowl. It was plentiful and fresh. $9 is a hefty price, but atleast it was tasty. I would give this place 5 stars, but their crazy loud music and dirty bathroom was not ideal."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for us it was a terrible experience, there was one customer in there with three people attending the one person who saw us come in completely disregarded us, didn't acknowledge us for about 5 min she was making a juice behind the juice bar three feet away, I mean not even a smile. Anyway once she got to us we made our order but unfortunately the juice I wanted contained pineapple my favorite and by 2pm they had ran out??? I said never mind mine my husband just ordered his juice. So we waited about 10 min another family came in ordered got there drinks and left and we hadn't received the one juice we ordered. I walked up to the young lady short hair asked her what had happened to our order she said she would get right on it and asked what we ordered??? I told her really, we have been waiting and she had been doing other things but not the one juice we ordered??? I was livid I have small children so they had enough of patiently waiting. To her surprise before she started the juice a young man pointed out he had already completed the drink more than 10 min. Ago and was just sitting there. Never again will we go back."}
{"text":"We love Nekter.....although...unfortunately this location was FILTHY!  The floors were gross, the kitchen is gross and dirty, the tables sticky dirty, the actual bowls were runny and smelled bad.   The health department needs to check this location out.  I think that everyone there is very young and need to be trained in how to clean the machines and facility.
We threw out our order and left."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! When we used to go to manhattan beach I would go to the location there every day! When we got back I said to my friends I wished they opened a location next to Starbucks and surely enough about a year later it opened up! I was sooo thrilled and shocked and excited to go there for breakfast a few times a week. I give this place a 4/5."}
{"text":"I always get their pink flamingo! I love the bright color and also it tastes so yummy!"}
{"text":"I only give it 4 stars because the they are so darn expensive. They are clean, friendly and the juices taste fantastic. Love that it is fresh  and healthy.  Wish they had a better order on the go app so I can just pick up when I'm in the hurry. They do have the app but it doesn't work all that well."}
{"text":"Cold pressed, served immediately, organic farm fresh veggies.  This is how juicing is supposed to be done. Five stars for not being like all the others."}
{"text":"What a refreshing place.  Clean, friendly staff, delicious fresh made, organic good for you drinks.  My favorite is \"the buzz\", a tasty mix of carrot, lemon, ginger and other stuff, it will \"pump you up\".  

My girls love the Acai bowls and make a healthy meal out of them.  They have drinks in a case, or fresh-made.  Whatever you get, I'm sure you will enjoy."}
{"text":"You may have to wait a few minutes for your juice and/or acai bowl. However, the wait is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Completely addicted. I love the friendly staff and their willingness to help of your looking to order something specific. I watch the grams of sugar and they are so helpful and knowledgeable about what I should and shouldn't have. Plus Everything tastes amazing. I've never once had anything I didn't like. My kids love the pink flamingo and as a health snack I'm ok going there often to get them one. I can't say enough positive things about the staff and the freshness and flavor of their products."}
{"text":"So disappointed in the lack of service.  Do not go to this place.  Ordered a cleanse and prepared for it, drove 20 minutes for them to tell me they never checked their email and ran out till Wednesday.

Horrible customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Came in last Saturday. Had never been here before, but was supporting a local fundraiser. Cashiers weren't on top of knowing about this at first- until we showed them the flier? I'm not quite sure how they were even keeping track either?

With that said, I ordered a pre made drink they carry in their refrigerated area. These vary in flavors and are a type of detox. I got the strawberry lemonade. It was extremely sour, a kick of cayenne pepper & chunks of fresh strawberry throughout. I wasn't a fan and it was tough to get down!

Also ordered the: Acai Banana Berry Bowl, Acai Peanut Butter Bowl and a \"skoop\" with strawberry. All were delicious. My husband was so surprised at how delicious the Peanut Butter bowl was. He really enjoyed it! 

Full portions and filling bowls. It's a meal in itself! A healthier alternative to ice cream too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love nékter! My experience at this location was great and my juice was the highlight of my day! Nothing make me feel better than a nékter juice!"}
{"text":"LOVE this location and all of their juices!!! My favorite, go-to is the Greenie, with ice and add ginger. 

Their customer service service at this location is awesome too! Yesterday our office, placed and order to pick up and even though they typically require you to place the order on line, I didn't want to have my credit card info saved so they allowed me to call it in. We had 11 drinks total and when I arrived to pick them up they had them ready and packaged up so I could get them back to the office without spilling. 

Excellent customer service, fast, friendly and everything is fresh & delicious!"}
{"text":"Their acai bowls are awesome. I got the PB one and what I like about this place is
1. They serve the acai bowls all day
2. You can customize what goes inside and on top

I just wish they had more size options. The bowls are beautiful but I find myself wasting about 1/3 of it every time and its not really something you can put in the fridge  for later. And for the price, I really don't like having to throw the excess away."}
{"text":"Nice place to get a yummy and healthy smoothie. They changed their hours and are now open at 7am, which is nice. I like getting a drink before work. The employees are super friendly and make quality food and drinks. 

The only bad thing I have to say about this place is my experience with the wheat grass shot. It was fine going down until I got home. And then it all came back up. This didn't just happen to me but my two friends as well. It took me awhile to go back after that experience. 

Stick with the juices & smoothies and you should be just fine."}
{"text":"This juice bar was not opened last time I was walking around DT Summerlin. I'm pregnant so a fresh juice or smoothie sounded good. I went with the \"pink flamingo\" it was between that and a berry banana deal. The girl said that was the better more sweeter one. It was $6 and change for a small drink. Drink lacked in flavor kinda. It was very odd because the drink was this HOT PINK color that didn't even resemble any of the fruit in the drink. So that's kinda creepy, maybe they add a color dye to it. Couldn't figure it out, it was so pink that it changed the color of my whole mouth & teeth.. Not really what I'm looking for with a \"fresh, healthy juice bar\". Doubt I'll go back!"}
{"text":"In case you didn't know, their bottled juices are made and shipped in from Cali... Not in store where they make fresh juices. I enjoy their juices but they are over priced."}
{"text":"This is a great place. The staff was friendly and provided some great suggestions. Smoothies were delicious and the kids loved them as well."}
{"text":"I am a huge Nekter fan. I go here every morning and switch up my orders all the time because everything on the menu is amazing. Great customer service as well."}
{"text":"Decided to get on the nutrition train so I decided to introduce juicing into my diet. Nekter Juice Bar is the best! Sublime, the Buzz, any of their juices are good. 

Use the app, you can get a free juice after 10 purchases and also you can add free items to your juice when you place your order on the phone. I'm pretty busy so I order my juice, add my free ingredients and then walk into Nekter and no waiting, they have my juice ready to go.

If you refer a friend to use their app, they kick you back $3. Not a bad deal.

Service is awesome, ingredients are fresh, the bar has a cool hip vibe to it."}
{"text":"So delicious. Decent price, but a tad bit lengthy wait. Try a smoothie!! Low calories and it tastes like it should be fattening"}
{"text":"I was super excited to try out Nekter after hearing people rave about it on the radio. I must say I was unfortunately disappointed. There were not too many people when I came in & two in line before me. I thought it took an abnormally long time to get two peoples juice order over 20 minutes at least. I grabbed a charcoal lemonade and ordered the pitaya the total came to about $15 which I thought was pricey but if it was worth it no biggie. I waited over 30 minute to get my pitaya bowl. Seemed pretty ridiculous since nothing needed to be cooked. Honestly the flavor wasn't there for me both the juice and bowl were bland and I felt it wasn't worth the price or wait. I may give it another shot with different items but will not go out of my way to visit again."}
{"text":"I really love the juices, the bowls and the service. To come here is a treat! Everything is really fresh and taste really good. My favorite is the Pitaya bowl.. I think that is what is called. I also recently tried some ginger juice shots which were so good. They sell a variety of snacks and already made juices if you want to stop by quick for a snack as well. Located directly next to Macy's in Downtown Summerlin. They should really think about doing a stamp card or something to that effect as I know a lot of people come on the regular."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location but I frequent others around the valley. 

I have to say this was the WORST PB Bowl I've had yet. Here's why:

A) Four employees on duty, only one actually doing anything. As it was lunch rush, this left several other customers tapping their heels as well. We all stood at the counter waiting for over ten minutes for something that should take half the time. Also one of the three 'on duty but doing nothing employees' could have offered to bring it to our table but of course scrolling Instagram was more important.

B) The bowl itself seemed smaller than usual, was very watered down in consistency and lacked a peanut butter taste.

This is a great chain and I love eating at the other locations...this new one definitely has some kinks to resolve."}
{"text":"Fabulous addition to the neighborhood... The folks are always friendly and the smoothies/juices are always fresh and fulfilling. This place is a regular on my rotation."}
{"text":"I got the toxin flush and my taste buds were hit with the amazing lemony punch and subtle parsley flavor. It was sweet enough to hide the ginger in the background without forgetting about it. Definitely enjoying this drink! The staff was super friendly and courteous. Very patient while I was scanning the menu for the first time. P.s. don't ruin your health with the other shared space of the store (Rocky Mountain chocolate place)."}
{"text":"I was so excited when I saw a Nekter opening in east Mesa! This one is by far my favorite (and I've been to every location in the valley because I love this place!) It's super open inside and very clean. They are normally busy right when they open but they do a great job at getting orders out fast! Every time I've been here since opening the staff has been super friendly and helpful. Hands down best juice bar!"}
{"text":"Soooooo happy the east side finally has an amazing juice bar-NEKTER-
Love all of the juice options and the staff are amazingly fun and friendly!    This will bet 2nd home"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Nekter. I had heard really good things about the place so I thought I should try it. 

The girls in there all seemed like they didn't really understand how to speak to humans let alone be nice about it. I walked up to the counter & placed my order & the girl looked at me like I was speaking German. Weird, but whatever. 

I got my smoothie & it was EXTRA thick, which is totally fine. I figured I could just let it melt a little then I would be fine. Like 15 mins later I still couldn't drink it. THICKER THAN A SNICKER.  I took it back in & asked them to reblend it just to break it up a bit & they seemed personally offended. As if i had dishonored their families. It was kinda weird, tbh. 

Probably won't go back. Not really into the vibe."}
{"text":"We went here Saturday afternoon and came upon the cashier who had a huge case of resting b**** face. She stared at us blank faced and didn't say a word until we ordered, but the whole time she looked absolutely miserable. 

We ordered a peanut butter smoothie called the Healthy Nut and were completely disappointed with it. It tasted like watery peanut juice. It was so bad that we threw it away after a few sips...a waste of $9! Won't be coming back here again."}
{"text":"We are vegan, gluten-free and very health conscious. This is the only juice/smoothie/açaí place  in Summerlin that provides all of our needs and, despite other reviews that I read, the customer service is always good."}
{"text":"The juice was good and the place looked cool to hang out, as long as you don't bring your toddler.
I would have stayed but there were no high chairs in sight and it had a bit more of a pretentious vibe than I bring my kid to."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I will definitely be back. I love great tasting Healthy stuff! Thanks Nekter!"}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! Best smoothies around!! Must try the acai bowls!! I have tried every single one of them and have never been disappointed!! They are absolutely delicious!! I could eat here everyday!!"}
{"text":"Date pits in my \"chocolate dream\"!  I thought the blender was a bit noisy when our \"chocolate dreams\" we're being blended - here is a photo of the chopped pits - $25.00 later yikes - not sure what to say -"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I found it to be very refreshing.  The concept of the smoothie in a cup smothered with fruits and granola is pretty doggone good.  I will be back to try more on the menu for sure"}
{"text":"Nice new Nekter Juice Bar at Desert Ridge Market Place. Friendly staff, ordering is easy. Can even order ahead using Nekter App. Just tell them when you arrive and they will make it! Great time saver. Juices are quick. Takes extra time to make those great acacia bowls but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Nekter is a quick, convenient, healthy place to grab a snack! I love their acai bowl - I add apple juice instead of milk or agave and it makes the perfect go to refreshing snack on a hot summer day! The service is also amazing and I always enjoy my 10 minute visit. You can even call ahead and have it ready for you when you arrive."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience here! I walked in and was immediately met with a bad attitude by one of the ladies behind the counter, she seemed upset that there was a customer for her to take care of. I placed my order while she spoke rudely to the other gal working as the try to figure out how to give the only other customer in the store his order without it spilling. One gal made my order while the other one continued to work on the other customers and they have a bad attitude the whole time. At one point they are talked 
about how another employing better hurry his a** up and get to work. At this point I noticed how disgustingly dirty the work area was. There were fruit and veggie remnants everywhere including the floor and dirty blenders all over the counter. They were having to push things aside to make room to slice ingredients for my acai bowl and the gal making my bowl pulled a dirty spatula out of one blender looked at it trying to decide if she could use it again and then decided on barely rinsing it with water. When she brought me the bowl I asked for it to go and she rolled her eyes, because putting a lid on is so hard. I then asked for a bag and she sighed and got a bag and napkin. She then realized there were no spoons and started storming around looking, when she finds them she says \"oh good I was about to freak out\" and then rips the bag open and holds it open to me In a way that would have caused my to touch about 5 spoons while trying to get one, I told her I didn't want to touch all them and she reluctantly opened it at the end so I could get out just one. Upon leaving I told them that it looked very dirty and that I am going to have a hard time continuing to pay $10 for a bowl of fruit if this is what the work space looks like and instead of apologizing she snapped at me about how they had been swamped. If I received service like this at McDonald's I would be disappointed, this is a ritzy $10 acai bowl establishment and it is embarrassing and shameful that your employees act this way!"}
{"text":"This location the Customer Service hmmm ok... Second time I ordered from this location and it still was bad.. Thanks but I will continue to make the drive to the Nektar on Scottsdale Rd"}
{"text":"Wow. I was shocked when I went online and saw similar feedback to the experience i just had. I have been to this Nekter a bunch of  times but stopped a while ago due to a bad experience. I gave it another try today. I logged into the app while I was in line and was happy to be welcomed back and give. $3 off a 16 Oz smoothie. The girl couldn't figure out how to use the barcode. A second girl came over and just gave me the smoothie for free. When they called my name, they gave me a bowl vs drink. It was my order and  I had already waited 20 minutes so I took it and left. I would have rather just paid and got the right thing."}
{"text":"Love this location!! Super friendly service. Lia gave us some great suggestions for new bowls to try! :) LOVE the vegan protein options as well!!"}
{"text":"Grab and go is a nice concept if you have someone who would actually ring you up! Walked in at 7:08, grabbed my grab and go,  and I stood there,  no eye contact, no let me finish this order,  nothing I just stood there, at no time did she say I will be with you in a moment.  When I walked in she was working on two bowls and a juice there was one person in the loby,  one bowl was for him. He left and I assumed she would say something to me,  she didn't, I was clearly holding my 2 items from grab and go fridge.  A minute later a guy comes in and she talked to him still ignoring me.  She asked him if he placed the to go order he said yes,  and went to the bathroom, clearly not in a rush.  Still no communication with me,  at that point I was mad that she never acknowledged I was there,  and I left the business without breakfast and late to work.  Maybe they were understaffed,  buy customer service is a must,  communication is key. Very disappointed that one of the few establishments I can eat in being Vegan has this poor of service."}
{"text":"Green juices taste like dirt.
Berry smoothies have too much texture to enjoy.

I love healthy shops and I especially prefer to drink organic products. But for $7+ drink, it's NOT worth it."}
{"text":"Best juicers in the biz! This place is great for whatever your feeling up to whether it's a cleanse or a bowl or a smoothie everything here is great but a little on the pricey side but you get what you pay for so you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm trying to like this place (a lot), but the service at this location is consistently horrible. The staff always seems frazzled, confused and frantic. It might help if they were a tiny bit more friendly, but doesn't seem like it's part of their DNA (or making an effort, at least). Outside of the service, I'd say the product is pretty good."}
{"text":"Consistent, quick service. The food and juices are light and refreshing but still filling. The rewards program is also a plus!"}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! Worth it! The price are a little high but for freshness you have to expect it. Never long lines and my Acai is made quickly. Im not big on fruit but this place has me liking fruit."}
{"text":"Pretty dirty bathroom and seemed like guys were new as my bowl was missing pineapple and the cashier was unsure how to ring me up."}
{"text":"Love the tropical cooler with protein , toxin flush is another favorite and a ginger shot! Love your staff! The morning girls are the BEST!!! I am in every morning to start my day right!!!"}
{"text":"A GREAT option for healthy food on the go. I especially like the acai bowls that are filled with fruit and granola. Decent sized portions for the pricing, friendly staff, and a very clean environment. I would recommend Nekter to anyone wanting a taste of healthy living!"}
{"text":"Staff was amazing. They are so welcoming and up beat! I tried the Pink Flamingo that the girls suggested, and I absolutely fell in love with it. I will definitely be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"With a new year comes a new me... that's what everyone says... so of course every gym is packed and everyone is all about eating right. One of my previous spots closed down so I decided to give Nékter a shot for a 3 day cleanse (I do this for all my tri-training so not a New Years Resolition fluke). All are cold pressed and you can order online or come in and get a full day cleanse in a nice cooler bag. I typically hit up when I have a juice crave and don't feel like making my own at home.  

Did the Advance Cleanse and it was as expected. I didn't favor bottle 3 which is beet based but drink that one with a straw as it will stain your lips if not careful. The last bottle of the day (6) was a bit thicker than expected but i was good with it. They have some good specials so check them out online."}
{"text":"This place has great juice. I ordered a custom blend and I had a couple of their smoothies and they were all good. From the cold case I recommend the vanilla protein, it is like desert. Everyone here is so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My fave juice spot in PHX. Affordable and fresh! For protein junkies, try the health nut. For regular juicers, my faves are the buzz and green apple detox.

Downside: wish they didn't sell out of the charcoal lemonade so fast!"}
{"text":"I heart juice, especially beet juice. Not only that they now have skoops which are vanilla and chocolate dairy free ice cream which taste AHHH-mazing! Lactose intolerant for the win!"}
{"text":"So I walked into the very cheerful cashier and ordered the Banana Berry Acai Bowl, made from freshness in front of you, awesome. This frozen treat is topped with granola and fresh sweet fruit. Recommend to anyone looking to try something new and delicious."}
{"text":"My Co-worker was raving about nekter's Açaí bowls and I couldn't understand what could be so great about essentially a blended smoothie with some fruit on top.. but gave it a shot. I got the banana strawberry açaí bowl and OMG IT WAS AMAZING! It was incredibly fresh and much thicker than a normal smoothie. The granola, fruit, and yummy blend really hit the spot! I had mine split in half to save for later but it's a huge portion but rightfully matched the slightly inflated price but overall worth it!"}
{"text":"We did let employees know ...twice actually both of them said it was right and kept on working"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm not enough of a \"health nut\" to appreciate this place, but the smoothie I had was not very good.  I can't help from paraphrase the Bible where it says \"neither hot nor cold so I will spew thee out of my mouth\" to say \"neither savory or sweet, so I will spew this out of my mouth\".  This is from a guy who has channeled Rocky and used to drink raw eggs, so I can tolerate a lot.

It was the unappetizing color of mud, super bland, couldn't taste ingredients, and it wasn't cheap.  I worked it down to the last third and threw the rest away.  My wife got a different smoothie, and also said it was bland.

Service was so-so, nothing to complain or praise - indifferent.  Place was basically clean, but hadn't been wiped down for a while - crumbs here and there.

The other reviews praise the Acái bowls - has to be a better choice than what we had."}
{"text":"I came here on a busy weekend morning with my good friend who used to work at a different Nekter location. When we walked in there were at least 8 people waiting for their orders and only one teenage boy working. My friend and I waited about 10 minutes before another teenager came from out back to take our order. After about another 15 minutes we finally got our order, but there were still many other people waiting. Our drinks were okay, not as good as other locations, but more than anything the service was bad. They are definitely understaffed and need better management because 25 minutes for a smoothie is fucking stupid."}
{"text":"The customer service was not good. Not very friendly. When I said I didn't want ice in my juice drinks now  one apologized for that. not good and we waited 45 minutes for 4 drinks!! The location at Town and Country NEVER takes this long. Unreal. The app said I would wait 23 minutes. It was 40 minutes and maybe 2 other customers in the store."}
{"text":"This place is OK. It's very pricey for what you get. I'm all for healthy and it definitely delivers in that arena, but over $6 for a 16oz smoothie is a bit much (especially since I'm not sure they even use organic non GMO produce). I do wish they had a bit more substantial food offerings as well (like oatmeal, quinoa, or something along those lines). Overall though decent place and cool retro atmosphere."}
{"text":"DONE with this location. EVERY time I come here someone making the food/smoothies is wiping their nose or touching their face with their gloves on. Just sick. 

I consume this food as a healthful treat that nourishes my body and I don't look to get others' germs and therefore sick because they can't be mindful of touching their face/hair/nose while making the items. 

Management: this is NOT the first time complaining about the cleanliness. Your location has just lost a customer (and possibly more)!!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. I had a peanut butter protein smoothie thing. I tried to give it to my dogs and they wouldn't even try it. It tasted like a cup full of water with a dollop of peanut butter. Like water peanut butter. It was so gross."}
{"text":"Drove 25 minutes out of my way to find that they're open but their servers are down (??) so I couldn't order ANYTHING.  Incredibly frustrating considering the employees were still there, can still make the order, and collect cash the old fashion way and just log orders.  Ridiculous.  Turns out the servers were down since 8am and nothing has been done since then to fix it. JUST CLOSE THEN!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting to write this review because I've been hoping these issues would be worked out on their own - I truly believe they have a remarkable product. I've been to Nekter (this location) quite frequently since they opened and was an addict for the first few months. The Popeye Acai is my favorite, Date Nut is great, and the green Toxin cleanse is delicious as well. I also love the prepacked green juices and have tried the famous Acai bowls. 

The product has been extremely inconsistent as of the last 3 months or so. The last 3 times I've been there the following occurred:

1) Chunks of frozen banana (Popeye Acai)
2) Chunks of some kind of tart/bitter powder (Popeye Acai)
3) Pieces (lots) of pit from the Date Nut smoothie which rendered this smoothie un-drinkable unless I wanted to use a strainer. I'm assuming the hard rock like bits were pieces of pit.... 
 
The last one was when I actually decided to call and tell them about what I've been experiencing. My hesitation was that I would call and the message would never make it to management... either way, I tried the phone number that came up on Google as well as the number listed directly on Yelp - first number seemed to be corporate office which was closed and the phone number to the store just didn't go through at all (was during store hours). Thus, I reluctantly resorted to Yelp. 

I love this product. Truly. And will be trying the North location from now. I will not return to Hilton Village."}
{"text":"I've become a big Nektar fan - and so far I think Nektar is seriously the best of the healthy juice bars in Phoenix right now.

My path to Nektar juice bliss was a bit of a roundabout.

I started as a fan of another fairly new juice operation in the area - Grabbagreen. I got addicted to the fresh juices at Grabba and visited then 3-5 times weekly for many months now.

But then Grabbagreen started to strike me as Grabba-Greedy (you can read my review there as well).

Nekter is the new juice & Acai bowl star in town, and they deserve your business.

#1 is the quality of the juices and prices here are superb. MUCH lower prices for fresh juices than GrabbaGreen or Whole Foods (and a little more than Sprouts, which now has a $3.99 juice operation at some locations).

They have a great menu of fresh juices and smoothie drinks as well. My favorite is the \"Date Nut\"  consisting of a yummy blend of cashew nut milk, dates, banana, nutmeg and blended with ice. The nutmeg add a really interesting flavor note, and the cashew milk is a creamy dream!

As others have said, the place is nice and clean inside - spotless and modern.

Yes the service can be a tad slow at busier times, but since everything is made fresh to order I don't mind waiting 10 min for some drinkable deliciousness. 

My oldest daughter introduced me to the Acai Bowls here and they are AMAZING. So far I've tried the Açaí Banana Berry - with Açaí, banana, cashew nut milk, berries and hempseed granola and topped with bananas and berries. This is really like a meal or dessert in itself.

The juices here are fresh and consistent.

I would highly recommend Nekter for anyone looking to get a healthy treat - I love this place."}
{"text":"While shopping around at Downtown Summerlin Nekter Juice Bar offers a quick fix to your thirst or hunger. I appreciate that the employees are usually friendly and attentive. 

One of my favorite juices is the Greenie. Based on their ingredient list online the Greenie contains, \"Parsley, spinach, kale, celery, cucumber, lemon, and apple.\"

If you're looking for something to indulge on, but don't want to fully ruin your diet the Berry Banana Burst is a must try. Based on their ingredient list online it contains \"Strawberry, banana, blueberry, housemade vanilla cashew milk, and a little agave nectar.\" 

I do recommend giving this juice bar a try if you're at Downtown Summerlin. 

Just be cautious if you're planning on paying with cash. A while back my fiance's mom was turned away for trying to pay with a $100 bill. Small bills or card is the best way to go."}
{"text":"Super friendly and helpful staff! Everything is fresh and the juices are delicious (and will no doubt help my husband and I kick our colds!) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  Exactly the breakfast we were looking for!  Up from Tucson for baseball and Yelped to see if there was a smoothie bar nearby. Our Acai Banana Berry bowls were tasty, fresh, and filling. Wish this was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"Very poor services.  The stuck up girls working there make terrible juices.  They taste like sour tart , mostly water juices.  Awful!  I will never go back there again.  If you want a really good, healthy juice, go to whole sale food market."}
{"text":"After a terrible experience yesterday at JUBY TRUE. I was really happy with Nekter Juice Bar. I asked the cashier what she recommended for a sweet drink ( I have a huge sweet tooth but wanted to be healthy) and she answered with the Pink Flamingo so that is what i ordered. It was delicious and well worth the price! I got a 16oz but I will get the huge size on my next visit!!"}
{"text":"I went in the first time just to try it, it looked like a cute little juice shop. I got one of the to go juices and it was amazing and pretty low calorie. I have gone back 3 times in one week, which is crazy because I was never a juice fanatic. The staff is really friendly and helpful, which is always a plus. I definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Yum Yum Yum! I come here everyday Mon-Fri. I have always received exceptional customer service and in a timely matter even when there are lines to the door! The staff members always suggest new items, take of their gloves when checking you out, being patient with you and making sure you get what you want. Amazing location thanks so much guys"}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly employees. I love that they make therw jucies fresh to order. Very tasty. I wish they offered the 3 day juice cleanse like their competitors of Juby true. They only offer one day the one day is a very reasonable price"}
{"text":"I am please to have a lot of Nekter around but I am a little disappointed in their Acai bowl.They aren't sweet enough and doesn't taste like the authentic one.I love their green juice way better like the Toxins flush is my favorite.

Thanks for being around :)"}
{"text":"Tasty acai bowls! Also, the guy at the counter was friendly, and gladly customized my bowl to omit an ingredient that I am allergic to."}
{"text":"I strongly believe in customer service. I wish it wasnt dead. I came into the store shortly after 9 PM. I get that the posted door sign says closed at 9 PM - but when the store has more than 15 customers in there and the employees are clearly still servicing customers, I would think 1 more wouldn't be so bad. What's serving 1 more guest while the doors are still open? Turning me away, a paying customer, seems like a poor choice in customer service. 

I will not be coming back. I was ready to purchase, now I will be moving on."}
{"text":"Nekter is a chain in California, Arizona and Colorado. They have juices, smoothies and acai bowls. You can grab a 1-day supply of cleansing juices for less than $50. I personally don't believe in juicing per se but hey, to each their own.

After having lunch in the area, I wanted a sweet treat. I also needed to undo the bad taste of a bad acai bowl I had hours prior to coming here. It took me 2 acai bowls to make it happen.

The place has a nice vibe. They have seating inside and outside. I ordered 2 acai bowls which came out quick. The problem I found is that they only come in 1 size (for about $8) which is large for most places and is anywhere from 390-520calories. They have lids in case you can't finish it.

PB Bowl:
Peanut butter, acai, cashew milk, strawberries, banana, hempseed, granola, dates and agave nectar. I added whey protein for a few cents extra. This was recommended by the girl behind the counter since I couldn't figure out which 2 bowls I wanted. Excellent!!! I couldn't stop eating this. The flavors and textures were perfect. The granola was light and crunchy even if I let it sit for a while. 5/5

Pitaya Bowl:
Acai, Pitaya, banana, coconut butter, coconut water, pineapple, granola, agave nectar and coconut flakes. Refreshing and fruity. Perfect consistency and naturally very colorful. 4/5"}
{"text":"So happy to have this juice, smooth & acia bar in the neighborhood. I highly recommend the Popeye & pink flamingo smoothies, the sublime juice and the PB acia bowl. *one hint of advice: they tend to overuse granola in the PB acia bowl*."}
{"text":"If you're going to develop an addiction, a healthy addiction is the way to go, and Nekter Juice Bar is definitely one of mine. The vibe inside this Gilbert hotspot is very beach chic and is reminiscent of Southern California. The inspirational quotes that are part of the decor (one wall reads, \"be fearlessly authentic\") give customers an uplifting message as they order up healthy, quick meals & juices. My personal favorite is the acai berry bowl, which is a delicious bowl of goodness filled to the brim with acai, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, granola, vanilla cashew milk, agave nectar and hempseed. I am also a fan of the juices, including the Toxin Flush and The Glow. The prices are reasonable and every time I have visited this neighborhood favorite, I have been greeted by warm, friendly professionals who are willing to take the time to explain what juice might work better for me depending on my specific needs. Visit Nekter today for a little bit of healthy heaven."}
{"text":"A little quiet establishment that produces some amazing healthy items. They focus on juices, smoothies and bowls.  There newest creation is an acai superfood bowl.  Recipe to follow.  It's a Starbucks but healthy.  Great for bringing in your laptop and catching up.   Fresh is the word here"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite juice spots! Any where you go juice isn't going to be as cheap as a soda but there juice is well worth the pay! The toxin flush is my favorite, tastes amazing and makes you feel even better. Friendly staff and cute setup! I go here all the time"}
{"text":"Always quick service with a smile at this location and delicious juices. I've had detox and greenie and they are both consistently good. 

Great location within Tempe Marketplace and late hours..I've found some of the other Nekter locations close around 7! 

One of these days I will need to try an Acai bowl!"}
{"text":"I love nekter! I come here alllll the time, and their bowls are literally giant. Cameron at this location is the sweetest. I walked in today and she offered me water immediately because it's so hot outside! They're the best"}
{"text":"First time in on a Sunday morning.  Several people ahead of me in line and it took what seemed like forever to finally get up to the front.  Could read the entire menu twice over.

While starring at the menu for 10 minutes I did appreciate the descriptions and caloric info.

Once I ordered my toxin something or other the customer service was friendly, but I had to wait another 20 minutes to get my small juice.  Was so bored I say there for a while unsubscribing from emails until I finally got my juice. They did apologize for the wait. 

Once I took a sip, it was surely delicious, but I definitely won't hurry back to come in here. I'll go through the trouble of making my own juice at home."}
{"text":"I love this juice/smoothie place. The place is quite small with only a couple tables to sit inside and one outside. There's a lot of free parking right outside. My favorite is their Acai bowl. I've only had the Acai Banana Berry one (never gets old)... the Peanut Butter or the Superfood one sound really good as well. The service was really good too! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had a big lunch and needed something different to satisfy my craving before meeting up with friends for a late dinner. I ordered their tropical cooler smoothie. It was supposed to have a puree of spinach and kale. I'm kind of obsessed with green smoothies. You don't actually taste the spinach and kale. All I tasted was just pineapple. I couldn't taste the coconut and banana. It was still a delicious power-packed smoothie. A great alternative to even skip dinner."}
{"text":"Okay, yum. I love smoothies and juices but have been curious to try an acai bowl for a while now. I saw a different location of this place by my work and had planned on stopping there before heading home but decided against having a smoothie bowl in a car in Phoenix on a half hour commute, so I came to the Chandler location instead. Walking in, I felt like a pretentious LA native on a juice cleanse. Menu items are a tad high (though I suppose this is a personal call to make) but so worth it. I got the banana berry bowl and it was so refreshing and tasty, I have no regrets. The staff were all really awesome as well!"}
{"text":"Ready liked Nektar.  Was in and out really fast.  I like that there are options without yogurt or ice cream.  There is one opening up near me also that I will recommend to neighbors."}
{"text":"Meh... not that great. I ordered the Greenie juice and it was extremely bland. It likely had way more water than anything else and it tasted like it was watered down. The order was not right because it was served to me with ice where I specifically requested no ice. I ended up sending it back for them to remove the ice and replace it with more juice. We also had to ask for straws because they were not available and were not replenished by the staff. Customer service was just OK and the taste was less than impressive. I what go to Whole Foods any day over this place for real juice."}
{"text":"Got the greenie and it was awesome! Service was great!! They were very friendly and helped us through the menu. Couldn't ask for more and it was great! Will be back"}
{"text":"Very tasty!! I had seen so many yoga pant wearing, top knot sporting, Michael Kors purse collecting chicks sipping on smoothies from this place I decided it might be worth a try. So I got up early this morning and headed over expecting my life to change upon trying one of the infamous Acai Bowls and it kind of did! Nektar really changed my perception of a GOOD breakfast that doesn't leave me feeling full and fat. I got the Tropical bowl and my SO got the berry bowl all together it was pretty expensive but I saw why once we got our bowls...they were HUGE. I really doubted I'd be able to finish the large amount of whatever it was without yakking. But I did, and it was really satisfying. If you're a person like me that had no idea what an \"Acai Bowl\" was just picture this: super creamy fruit frozen yogurt with granola, berries, etc., altogether it was a pleasant surprise!"}
{"text":"I work in the marketplace and come in for a lunch snack often.  Usually when I go in Lexi is working and greets me with a warm hello and smile. She's super helpful at recommendations when I want to try something new. She's works fast and always has a positive attitude. Great employee!"}
{"text":"Awesome juice and smoothie bowls! And the crew here is always Fast to get my order up. Keep doing what you're doing Nektar!"}
{"text":"This review is unfortunately so bad because of this location in-particular. Nekter itself is amazing ! Their pink flamingo and açaí bowls are the best. They recently did a menu change that slightly altered my new fave the peanut butter açaí bowl to include apples instead of blueberries. I'm allergic to apples so at this location I asked if I could please switch out my apples for blueberries. I swear he rolled his eyes and snatched my card. I left a tip per their prompt menu or 15% and I noticed he charged me $1.00 additional for blueberries ?meaning my bowl that was $8.35 was now $11.45 with tax tip and additional charge. Hate to be petty but back at my location in California they are kind and although they don't have the tips go through a prompt menu- I'm much happier to drop money in their jar for their awesome service. Desert ridge Nekter can take a couple tips from them!"}
{"text":"So glad Nékter finally made it to Tempe! Conveniently located at Tempe Marketplace, this place makes the most delicious acai bowls, smoothies, and fresh made juices. I highly recommend the \"Toxin Flush\" for all first-timers. I'm excited this location is open late, as most Nékters usually close at 7pm. They offer a variety of juice cleanses and on-the-go snacks as well. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Get ready to wait forever for a drink here. So ridiculous. The staff doesn't prioritize or make drinks in the order that they were ordered. I came in before work and waited almost 30 minutes for my drink. I was so close to walking out!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today after seeing this place on Yelp and I already can say I am obsessed. The place is actually easy to find and there is tons of parking close by. The inside is small but spacious and very clean and earthy. They do have a pretty big menu which I like so then depending on your mood or craving there is a lot to pick from. The prices are good, especially for Scottsdale and how organic and natural the food is. All together my price was $13 for two things which is not bad at all. I got, The 16 oz. Cure juice and the Acai Banana Berry bowl. The acai bowl was huge, and that's a good thing! you definitely get the amount of food for what your paying for! I had to wait about 5 minutes for my food which isn't bad at all since I went around 11:30 in the afternoon. There is lots of seating inside and outside as well. The employees were nice and asked right away if I needed a lid for my acai bowl which I appreciated since I was going to ask anyways. Overall if your looking for yummy juices and food for a reasonable price this place is for you! I definitely am telling everyone I know about this place and definitely will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Outstanding Acai Bowl. I don't do Strawberries so I subbed Blueberries. Staff was super friendly. Perfect breakfast on a hot day in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great place for
Fresh juice and to hangout for a little bit. They raised their prices over the years but still a good spot none the less. If you want a smoothie try Jamba Juice. For vegetable drinks go here"}
{"text":"I came here based on the yelp reviews. The juice was great and service was friendly (which is not a given at juice bars). 

Would come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love Nekter Juice Bar and today was another reason why. 

I ordered using the Nektar Juice app on my phone and ordered the new Skinny Colada smoothie and a Ginger Shot. I arrived about ten minutes later and the store had not received my order yet. Instead of making a fuss and trying to figure out the computer system, one person made my ginger shot while the other made the smoothie. After I received my items and started to leave, the employees then were going to get everything figured out.

Customer Service is always top notch for me and always so pleasant anytime I am in there. The store is clean, organized and I trust the food there."}
{"text":"Love this place! I am addicted. Perfect place to go for lunch on a hot day. My favorite go to meal is the PB bowl. So filling, and satisfying. A cold meal in the middle of this AZ heat is so satisfying. Not only are their smoothies, and bowls are delicious, but there also healthy. I highly suggest this place."}
{"text":"My first time here..i love the cleanliness and atmosphere of the place..lots of healthy options. I tried the banana berry blast which was the recommendation of the cashier. Turned out to be a very good choice! The staff are very personable. I hope to be back to try more of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great staff, yummy drinks. Cameron at the register was very friendly and helped me pick out a perfect smoothie."}
{"text":"My fave here is The Buzz but I like to add beet and ice. So nice and refreshing with a kick from the ginger!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love the one at 20th Street and Camelback.  Been to this location three times because it is significantly closer to my home. Always dirty, always empty shelves, always employees who do not acknowledge you to let you know it will be a few minutes."}
{"text":"After posting my allergic reaction story, Nekter portrayed EXCELLENT customer service in trying to review the situation and make attempts to fix the problem for future consumers

I appreciate thorough customer service and admire the overall company"}
{"text":"Just went in for an afternoon pick-me-up with my friend.  We ordered one after another.   She ordered the Chocolate smoothie and then a moment later I ordered the Date Nut smoothie.  I went to the restroom, and when I returned, my friend had already gotten her smoothie.  So, I thought it would just be a second or so.  Well about 7 minutes later, after seeing three people get their drinks who ordered after mine, I went up to the counter and someone came up to me and asked if I was still waiting.....DUH!!  I told her what my smoothie was that I was waiting for, she seemingly reluctantly made my smoothie, gave it to me without apologizing for taking so long and forgetting about me.  I took it and went on my way.  My first sip had a very hard rock like bit.  I took it out and didn't know what it was.  I had a second sip, another rock bit.  I decided to go back in and see what the hell that was.  \"Oh, it was a date pit, its supposed to be mechanically removed.  Do you want me to remake it for you?\"  Not if its going to have date pits in it!  So I asked for a different flavor.  She then brought it to me, said nothing...no apologies, no thank you for waiting, nothing!  So I wound up paying for a smoothie that I didn't even get to have or enjoy.  I am sorry, but the people who work there are so rude, and act like they are too good for anyone.  I will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here was amazing. I got an acai bowl and it was delicious. However, every time I've returned it's been horrible. They always mess up my order and everyone else's that I've been with. To add to that the staff is rude and incompetent. How hard is it to add some extra bananas or blueberries to an order? The quality of their juices and acai bowls is inconsistent. I've ordered the same thing each time I've been and it always turns out differently. When you bring up the fact that they made your drink wrong they are rude and insist it's right when you know it isn't! I would not recommend this place. They have horrible customer service."}
{"text":"The smoothies are really good and the staff is really friendly. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Had a coconut bar and a Popeye acai smoothie. Very nice people, nice interior setup. NOT ORGANIC. But tasty."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place! I only get juice and it's always great. I've heard the bowls are great too. Love the vibe inside and that it smells so fresh when you walk in. I feel the pricing is fair because juices are much more costly in places just up the road. My only criticism is that sometimes it takes a while for the juice to be made.  If you're in a rush, just grab one pre-made from the case."}
{"text":"Since Nektar Juice Bar has joined the North Scottsdale juicing options, it is now my go to. Nektar is awesome and way more affordable than its North Scottsdale competition: Juby True, Whole Foods, Grabba Green. By affordable I mean they are selling their juices for about $4 less per size than the competition. For example, Juby True 16 oz juice is $9.00 whereas you can get a 16 oz at Nektar for $4.75 or even a 32oz for $8.50! So far at Nektar, I've tried: The Buzz, The Cure, The Glow, and most recently, Toxic Flush - they are all really good. Nektar also has acai bowls; I've never had one but I've seen people eating them and they look really yummy!"}
{"text":"We love Nekter. They have a great product that is good for you, plus the staff is very friendly. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Shout out to Lindsey at Nekter Dana Park. Awesome way to add to my daughters graduation celebration. Acai bowls for a dozen people, travelled extremely well, packaging was amazing, all utensils and bowls provided along with individual sides for convenience. If you haven't been here, try it! It's addicting!!! And, if you have a party planned this summer this is a great way to keep everyone cooled off! Thank you so much Lindsey and team...you guys are fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Back when I was a youngin', the closest place to get an acai bowl was in San Diego. As California's exponentially lamer, younger sibling, Arizona has finally hopped on the bandwagon. 

We may never have an ocean, but acai blended with bananas, dates, strawberries, peanut butter and vanilla cashew milk, topped with hemp seed granola and bananas ain't a half-bad consolation prize.

Much love and appreciation (/primal cravings) for Nekter and their phenomenal peanut butter acai bowl."}
{"text":"Awesome juice shop!! Every time I stop by everybody is upbeat and has a great attitude... Great acai bowls too along with other protein options. My order is always made fast and right the first time"}
{"text":"My dinner last night consisted of a sesame bagel and a handful of tiny candy bars, so I figured I should try to eat a little better today.  I have wanted to stop by this place for awhile and swung by for a juice. I got a small Little Beet (16oz) and it was great!  The gal asked if I wanted ice and I said yes. Thankfully, they gave me a larger cup. Same amount of juice, just more room for ice!  It was fresh and delicious!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Quick service! I love how great the shop always smells. I'm so excited to drink my pink flamingo."}
{"text":"Experienced Great customer service with Cameron!
she let me sub pea protein with whey in the health nut and it tasted amazing! Definitely check this place out guys. - Daniel"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, free wifi, and good drinks. Try their Nektar app for rewards. Not particularly affordable (around $9 for a 24oz drink), but prices are still pretty competitive for Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Just not good. Had 2 açai bowls with my wife. It was icy and not as deep purple as you get with higher quality product. Would rather have paid more for something good...."}
{"text":"Nekter is a must! So much better than Jamba Juice or any other smoothie place. And the acai bowls are so good! Everything is fresh and very Tasty. My new favorite!"}
{"text":"I have come here everyday in the past week, sometimes twice a day.. I don't exactly know why I am so in love with this place, it's so refreshing in the summer! The juices are great, I love all of the smoothies I have tried so far. The acai bowls are really good quality and well made. My favorite treat to get when I come here is one of the Skoops, all of the flavors are excellent, especially the limited edition strawberry one. The staff is always very friendly and attentive, they are what makes this such a great location."}
{"text":"This place is so close to my nursing school that I'm here almost weekly and whenever I'm craving a delicious smoothie or acai bowl. I love going here for their Mango Delight or Pink Flamingo smoothies which are so refreshing! But one thing I'm not too fond of is their customer service. I've never realized how the employees acted until I read some of the reviews and started to notice the same things. For the past few visits, the employees weren't very friendly or gave a welcoming greeting and acted like they really didn't want to be there. I stopped by again today and there was no one at the counter for a whole 10 minutes. One girl finally came out from the back and didn't realize I had been there for that long, didn't even say a word and just looked at me and just waited for me to order. 

I really hope they do something about their customer service because I like this place too much haha I'd suggest to maybe have a tiny bell in the front of the cashier or to make sure to have a greeter at all times just so things like this won't happen. Other than that, their smoothies and bowls are great!"}
{"text":"Yes. I am a fan of Nekter Juice Bar. Such a fan that my in my first week of discovering it I went there 3 times. My go to is the health nut smoothie. The banana and peanut butter flavors are amazing and a medium smoothie definitely fills me up. 
I cannot wait to try their other products and maybe their juice cleanse after this pregnancy is over.
I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great place with friendly and knowledgable staff. Staff is aways willing to recommend drinks and bowls. Moderately priced but worth it. Everything is fresh and fab tasting. I also did the 2 day cleanse and after felt like a new person. I recommend any of the grab n go juices... The PB bowl is amazing... And the Pink flamingo smoothie is their most popular and taste great."}
{"text":"Great place, clean location, ok parking, great staff, quick service. If I'm in the area and feeling for something healthy I'd stop by here."}
{"text":"First time customer... The customer service was great! Super friendly and helpful. The juice I ordered is super tasty and nutritious too. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"I'm new to this great find. I've only been once and had the Toxin Flush. It is a wonderful blend of yummy! My next visit I have my eyes on their Acai bowls! It look great/ can't wait!

My 2 CON's here are: I called for business hours and the person that answered the phone, I assume couldn't hear me so hung up quickly. I called back and she just seemed pissed off. It honestly made me feel that maybe I should pay a visit today. Kinda ruined my good energy. Also, there were 2 people working and only use there and the counters were very sticky. I get why but there were 2 employees and no customers so clean up would be appreciated."}
{"text":"Just traveling through the city I needed a refreshing drink. Stopped to get  toxin flush. After waiting for the cashier to finish her 5 min conversation with her co worker I finally places my order. I ordered  medium, didn't notice was charged for a large. I wanted to try the vanilla latte, but after I realized the coffee wasn't fresh (it comes from a container they purchased from somewhere else) I didn't buy it. The Juice itself was good. Service, not good. Disappointed with coffee situation."}
{"text":"I love it here and the employees are awesome !!!! They have the best juices , smoothies, available bowls, protein snacks , everything is delish and super fresh . Top notch quality ingredients and amazing service !"}
{"text":"Got one of the bowls which was very good, but a bit pricey. Basically a smoothie with fruit slices, granola and agave nectar on top. Taste alone it was 5 stars, but for $8 it is 4 stars."}
{"text":"I couldn't help but appreciate the freshness of this place. Left full of clean nutrition and feeling healthy!"}
{"text":"Super cute interior and fresh juice, smoothies, and acai bowls. It's good and everything was as expected. Their acai bowl was really good, actually. Only downside is price (expensive) and takes them awhile to make your order."}
{"text":"Nekter Juice Bar offers up more than juices, which is a good thing if you're a fan of acai bowls (like me) and not so much of a fan of juices (like me).  After I saw Cathy C.'s photos for her acai bowl, my stomach did a happy dance, rejoicing that another place near me was offering up the fruity goodness.

I had the Acai Banana Berry bowl (\"acai, banana, nut milk and berries blended together on top of agave granola topped with bananas, blueberries, and strawberries\").   I also added spinach and kale for extra nutrients and I'd definitely order this again as it was fresh, flavorful, and fruity. I came here with Angela T. and she had ordered the Pitaya Bowl.  I didn't really like the sample of her bowl that much; it was too sour for my taste and she didn't exactly enjoy it, either.
If you're visiting Downtown Summerlin and have a hankering for a juice, smoothie, or acai bowl, stop by Nekter."}
{"text":"The second Nekter Nevada location has been open for less than a week and it's located in Summerlin, just like the first location.  Nestled next to a popular bagel shop and an even busier coffee place, Nekter fits right in at the Trails Village Center.  
Come here for juices, smoothies, and acai bowls.  Nekter also offers their Nekter Cleanse line, 6 cold-pressed juices daily to be taken from one to five days.  I don't juice, but I know it's a popular thing these days.
I'm a fan of the Acai Banana Berry bowl and the Popeye's Acai smoothie.  Their products have just the right amount of sweetness and I like that nutrition info is available for everything on their menu.
Grand opening is set for Saturday, September 12th, from 7:00am - 11:00am.  The first 50 customers get a $25 gift card.

HOURS:
Monday-Friday 6:00am-8:00pm
Saturday 7:00am-8:00pm
Sunday 8:00am-7:00pm"}
{"text":"Delicious! I love their grab and go options especially. Acai bowls, smoothies and juices are all great. The PB bowl is my favorite. Staff is very friendly too. I always stop by when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"This place has been fantastic for my daily juices. Tasty and if you use the app it's fast to walk in and out, however; the last 6 times I came in the online order machine is broken and I've been late to appointments for work because my order was not started until I arrived. If you own this business please fix the machines. I want to keep using your services."}
{"text":"I like the pillows in the booths. 
I dislike the length of time it takes to get a shot of wheatgrass.
The juices and smoothies taste amazing and fresh.
The prices are ridiculously high. 
Clean, great decor, aesthetically pleasing.
No patio or outdoor seating."}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from my job, not only is it close by but have a variety of Acai bowls that I absolutely love. I'd visit more often if it wasn't for the service, sometimes you get a nice girl upfront or a total rude one. To say the least when I asked for a bag the girl behind the cashier grabbed it & just threw it on the counter. She was quick to realize that that wasn't the smartest thing to do and put my bowl in the bag. It's unfortunate to have to stop yourself from coming to this location due to bad service but maybe the drive to a different location isn't so bad to get treated better."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious juice fresh tasting and crisp! The facility was in pristine clean condition! I'll be back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and got one of their acai bowls. So delicious!!! One of the best ones I had. Great service, felt very welcomed and the place smells great!"}
{"text":"I completely agree with everything Kristi J said.  I do love the acai bowls, but the wait is always long, the staff not very friendly, and the prices are outrageous.  Can't order online and they don't have a phone to call in a order so you don't have to wait.  I will try Thrive (where they have more than one size) and Jamba Juice has a decent bowl too."}
{"text":"Just picked up my 3 day juice cleanse and the products are awesome and bagged nicely and the price seemed consistent if not better than other juice spots. Each juice is numbered so you know which order to drink them in. 5 stars for the product but the customer service this morning was lacking. I ordered two 3 day juice cleanses with 6 extra bottles of a protein smoothie for a total of $300 and couldn't get a smile out of anyone working there, all looked disinterested in life in general. The guy who looked in charge gave me 42 bottles of juice and then stated \"I guess you need help to your car\".....the tone was too much for me so I lugged them all out myself and was just thankful that I don't hate where I work because being that miserable looks like a lot of work"}
{"text":"Nekter is a pretty affordable and relatively healthy juice, smoothie and acai bowl chain. I like this place for breakfast when I'm busy with work and want to drink my meal. 

Pros - Clean store, friendly employees, and tasty drinks (I'm fan of the Healthnut smoothie with almond butter). Plus for the price you pay, you get a HUGE portion. 

Cons - Orders can take a while, so even if you order ahead, give it 20 minutes for an order for multiple people. I also think they should offer smaller sizes because sometimes you don't want 16-24oz of fresh juice or a huge acai bowl that starts to melt before you're done."}
{"text":"So its Saturday at approximately 4:30 and some red head is putting up chairs on the tables and dragged in the sign out front...yelp states they are open till 6:00. Soooo either yelp is incorrect with the hours or this girl REALLY wants to go home. Basically kicked out customers who paid for their drinks and were sitting inside....thank goodness there is a Starbucks next door that we can sit at and be appreciated. NEVER COMING HERE."}
{"text":"Nekter is my go-to healthy food! I have been to this location almost everyday. The bowls are delicious. My favorite items include the: acai banana berry bowl, banana berry burst, and pink flamingo. 

This a great concept with delicious juices, smoothies, and bowls. :) 

P.S. Don't forget to ask for a punch card."}
{"text":"The Skoop is amazing!! I highly recommend this frozen treat to anyone with dietary restrictions. The chocolate skoop with coconut flakes, chocolate chips, And strawberries is yummy and refreshing. Also, I love getting the acai banana berry bowl and the orange smoothie. This location is right near Kierland and is a great stop during hot Arizona days."}
{"text":"Went today for a 24oz drink received a 16oz. I didn't bother to correct them. I remembered the service on the weekend is always subpar.  This is the reason I don't tip cashiers, they rarely get it right."}
{"text":"I love Nektar and we go here almost every time we are shopping. But every time we go to the DTS location they are struggling. Last time there was hard non edible chunks in my açaí bowl that kept hurting my teeth. That no one could explain. And today there is no toilet paper or paper towels in the bathroom. Staff is nice none the less, but there is huge lack of consistency at this location."}
{"text":"Pretty much the same as the other Nekter locations. The açaí banana berry bowl was good but could have used a little more agave nectar. I asked for extra but didn't seem to get it."}
{"text":"Love the açaí banana berry bowl. Staff is friendly and the place is always clean. The new Graviola bowl looks interesting, maybe next time..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Nekter Location because it's always consistent and clean. The manager Pricilla definitely has got her s#it together. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Favorite Acai Bowls in all of Las Vegas!
The place is small but they do have outside seating..
Their menu is very detailed & includes calorie information! 
Their peanut butter Acai bowl is absolutely amazing, I drive all the way from Henderson and to Summerlin just to get it..
Service is quite slow but I think it's worth the wait.."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! The acai bowls are all delicious and presented beautifully. My only complaint is how loud the music is every time I go in."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to get fresh juices and smoothies in Scottsdale! Highly recommend the toxin flush and berry banana burst smoothie! Shout out to Randi for always greeting me with a smile"}
{"text":"If you want to buy the \"cleanse\" , it is hit and miss if they have it in the store.  There is a group of us wanted to do it together.  This store told us to order online and they will be delivered to the store without a shipping charge.  Called their main office and was told they cannot deliver to this store.  There is a $20 shipping fee per cleanse.   I will go elsewhere now, across the street to Juby Juice for me."}
{"text":"Try their pink flamingo smoothie, it's delicious! Every time I have been here the drinks have been perfect. The atmosphere is great--it smells fresh and it is so colorful! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Good smoothies, mehhh acai bowls, but great service! No place compares to my fave acai bowl maker in little CDA, Idaho, \"The Wellness Bar\". Also, they are tad overpriced but aren't all the healthful places these days?"}
{"text":"They move very slow, their products (at least the acai smoothie I had) arent particularly good, and the wifi connection was shoddy. Boo."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and was in desperate need of a morning smoothie. I wasn't disappointed!!! It was one of the best I have ever had!!! I will be stopping back before I head out of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Nekter consistently makes a great product and has clean spaces. This location has plently of room and was a good spot to meet with a friend. A little difficult to hang out and have a conversation due to the loud blenders..if they could move them to the back or otherwise control the noise, this would be a regular hang out spot for me."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff. Smaller seating area than most Nekter Juice Bars, but that has been no problem. Always get my custom order correct. No issues. LOVE location! Conveniently close to physical therapy clinic where I run on antigravity treadmill & blocks from my OBGYN's office. Ample parking."}
{"text":"This Nekter is horrible! I go to Nekter every weekday at a fabulous Nekter on McDonald and Scottsdale Rd and order the same custom smoothie every single day (with few exceptions). There are no issues. No matter who is working, they never have any problems understanding what I am asking for nor making it for me. 

This terrible, horrible Nekter NEVER EVER has been able to just take my order and make it as I have asked without having issues, asking for clarification, lecturing ME, \"Well you know ... we will probably need to put ice in it ...\" 

No - I do not want ICE in it! I want you to make me my custom smoothie as I ordered it. Isn't that why it is called \"custom?\" 

\"Whenever I come here, there is always an issue,\" I voiced to the lady trying to pressure me to put ice in my smoothie telling me that without it it would be a juice. 

\"There is no issue,\" she replied, \"I'm just telling you you are not going to get what you want if you don't let us put ice in it. The other Nekter must put ice in it and just not tell you.\" 

I gave up.

\"Fine. Do whatever you need to do.\"

Then I heard her ask the lady who took my order, \"Wait, she wants mango in it too? Oh - I didn't see the mango.\" 

It appears she was wrong and I didn't need any ice after all. Like I told her from the beginning while the line lengthened behind me and she continued to waste time arguing with me to tell me I was wrong instead of just reading my order and making my smoothie. 

I hate that this Nekter is so much closer to my home and I am forced to come here if I want to stay on my strictly plant-based diet on the weekends because I literally dread stepping foot in this location. This is SO SO SO sad because I LOVE NEKTER!!! 

I have been to the one on Shea, the one on Scottsdale near the Quarter, and of course my favorite described above, and no where else have I run into such incompetence and annoying service. 

I am a Reiki Master and normally an extremely positive person. Not possible at this place. Would give zero stars if I could. Everyone has a breaking point. Having just left this place FOR THE LAST TIME, I have reached mine."}
{"text":"This Nekter is my favorite location anywhere! Marty and his team provide outstanding customer service on a daily basis! They know me by name, and they know \"my usual\" custom smoothie by memory. I come here almost every single weekday, and they do not disappoint. I rotate my protein choice, and they sometimes even ask me, \"Is it pea protein day or hemp protein day today?\"

Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name to just sit, relax, and enjoy a cold drink. For some, that may be their local bar. For me, it's my juice bar - my Nekter Juice Bar!!! 

#BeFearlesslyAuthentic"}
{"text":"Dan is the man!!! Amazing service and Nekter did not disappoint at all! Definitely a must see if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Pros: good for you so you'll feel full but completely satisfied after eating, small menu-in my opinion this is good because it's less overwhelming, they make it on the spot except the \"scoops\" but those are made daily, lovely farm house/market vibe, clean restrooms, friendly and informative staff. Located in the casa Paloma shopping area so there's shops to explore if you want to walk around. Also near an AJ's and other places that have outdoor seating of you want to leave but stay near to enjoy the area. 
The menu has a green juice cup next to menu items that would be good for fist time visitors. 

Cons: price BUT it is fresh and delicious and considered a meal but I still wish it was a bit cheaper. Small-this one in particular is quite small. The tables are high tops and that makes it not so family friendly and not much seating at all. There is seating outside but in Az that's not always best. 

I came in on a Monday. Not too busy but if a couple didn't leave, we would've had nowhere to sit inside. I also had my youngest in a stroller and was just fine but mind you,
It wasn't too busy. We ordered the chocolate scoop for 4.95 and 3 topping for an extra $1. Also the acai Berry banana bowl. I believe it was around 7 or 8 dollars. It was a big bowl and worth it. Scoops are rather small but they are more like creamy dessert and completely delicious!! I will go again. I want to eat my way through the menu!!!"}
{"text":"Service: The staff is very friendly and consistent, took their time and answered my questions about their products.

Food: It is always made fresh to order. Only draw back is they should use a better strainer before handing the drink over, two drinks had a considerable amount of pulp. 

Cleanliness: From the outdoor seating, to the indoor  dining area this place is kept like a hospital. Clean clean clean

Overall, I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Love this place... Nice and clean... Friendly staff  great healthy treat for all my walking around downtown summerlin."}
{"text":"This was very good! I had the Pink Flamingo, most the other things had bananas and I know you can ask to not have them but the Pink Flamingo is sweet and kinda spicy and very different so I just stick with that!  It's a very cool vibe inside, low lighting, lot's of wood.  It's a nice place!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the service is good and depending on if I order a bowl or drink, both are good! I'm always greeted when entering and most importantly my order is right! Will be back again soon!

Drink of choice: chocolate dream
Bowl: berry banana"}
{"text":"Very good! I love the selection of juices they have both pre made and on the menu. The chocolate dream is my favorite! Good service every time I've been! I haven't tried the Acai bowls here yet though. Kinda expensive though."}
{"text":"I really love those bowls including PB bowl and Pitaya bowl. I usually go there once a week for that bowl. I know that the price is kinda expensive but however I usually go there once a week.  Also staffs are amazingly friendly.  It would be nice if there is a reward club that will definitely keep me going! :)"}
{"text":"Nekter juice bar is incredible ! I love going there in the morning before work and on my lunch breaks when I can. The owner is SUPER nice! They just opened and staff there is incredibly sweet and charming :) i make everyone in my office go too! The Green Apple Detox is my favorite !!!"}
{"text":"The juice is good, but don't waste your time coming here. Even with 4 employees working and no other patrons in the restaurant, it takes forever to get your drink. Although the atmosphere is new and trendy, after waiting 10 minutes for a single drink I slowly began to realize it's actually kind of dirty inside, with litter scattered around the floor and the garbage bins overflowing. Will just go to Whole Foods next time, which is literally a few units down in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Summerlin is Nekter Juice Bar. Limited seating inside, so consider it a take-out juice joint. Vibe seems like Jamba Juice, but elevated because of the cleansing packages and fresh juices. After eating severely unhealthy for a couple of days in Vegas, I needed something lighter and healthier. Since I was in the area, I tried the Greenie and it consists of parsley, spinach, kale, celery, cucumber, lemon, and apple. It's double-strained so the juice was clean, foam-less, and tasty (well kind-of). Yes, it tasted like raw kale, but I knew it wasvgood for me. The apples helped add some sweet flavor.

Service was courteous and prices reasonable. I tried the 24 oz and it was a bit much. Next time I'll try the smaller size."}
{"text":"This team always makes me feel fabulous and taken care of!! They go above and beyond to make your day and the customer service at this location makes me not want to go to any other location!!"}
{"text":"I love Nekter juices! I always feel energized after drinking one. I've read other reviews about service complaints at this location but I've never had a problem. They've even gone above and beyond in the past to work with the other Scottsdale location when they ran out of cleanses to confirm they had this location had them in stock and held it for me until I got there. Very helpful and friendly!"}
{"text":"This location is amazing!! I used to go to the Scottsdale location but started going here after moving. I couldn't be happier with my experience there! First off, the employees are always really great and helpful! I ALWAYS get the pink flamingo, its amazing. I swear it tastes better at this location too!! I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for something healthy and refreshing to jumpstart their day!!"}
{"text":"This place has great service. My 1 star is because they increased prices 2 times within 6 months. Get over yourselves it's not that great to spend $9 for an acai bowl!"}
{"text":"I love nekter! However, the one reason I am giving this store ONE star is because I came here on a Sunday morning to order my favorite açaí bowl.  The young me in the cashier was very rude. He just stared at me waiting for me to say something instead of being considerate about customer service. While I was ordering he was having a conversation with another employee that working in the back. I love everything about this place but their customer service has some working to do."}
{"text":"Obsessed with their PB Bowl. Best Acai bowl I've ever had and I've had lots! Their smoothies are great too and everything I get is dairy free. The fruit is always fresh. Haven't tried their juice cleanses but want to one of these days."}
{"text":"went to the néktr at Tempe Marketplace. I got the açaí bowl, and let me say it's no Berry Devine. over all it was ok. had fresh fruit, granola, etc. so if you are in the mood for a quick healthy snack or smoothie, néktr is the spot."}
{"text":"This place is great if you don't care about customer service. It took us 5min for someone to even acknowledge that we were there, even though there were employees up front. Then, someone comes from the back to take our order and looks like she hates her job. She didn't smile once or even remotely seem like cared that we were there. 

Despite the poor customer service, every time I come here, I like what I get. I've gotten smoothies and the bowls and they are both great! It nice seeing everything being juiced and made in front of you. I would return, but only to-go because the unfriendly staff creates an unfriendly environment."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of places this is by the best. AJ was amazing each visit. He taught me how to use the app and earn perks. Make sure I'm happy leaving and makes good suggestions on the menu items. I've had the tropical cooler and liked it a lot. Their ice cream is delicious and fresh. It's not cheap but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I really like Nekter Juice but this location lacks in customer service. Today at 9:47 am a gentleman by the name of Pawel seemed to be pissy for no reason- rushing me to order when I needed a moment to view the menu. I asked him to separate my order of premade juice from my fresh order of juice. He crumbled up my receipt for the premade juice- didn't bother asking if I needed the item. I asked him if the premade juice earned points and yet again he was rude. There wasn't a long line behind me and I wasn't nasty towards Pawel but I couldn't help but think he was racist. I would likely suggest he separate his personal feelings from business. He also seemed very comfortable in his basketball shorts on with a hard on. The other guy with the short blonde hair who handed me my drink didn't speak to me  but as soon as I was walking out the door I could the two guys talk amongst one another which leads me to believe Pawel had something to say that wasn't nice. Today's green apple detox was great however my short experience this morning warrants a refund."}
{"text":"First time in and boy were they crowded. The staff was hustling like nobody's business and getting fresh stuff out quickly. I ordered a chocolate dream smoothie and the carob avocado mixture was just like drinking a chocolate shake. The berry smoothie was also very very good and as I watched the acai bowls go by, I was drooling. They are friendly, quick, and supremely healthy. Can't wait to go back and get another one!!"}
{"text":"Convenient location.
Clean and bright shop. Limited seating. 
Friendly service!
Long-ish wait times 
Juice is fresh, and tastes very healthy!

Came here for breakfast and had a blended juice (smoothie) - Supreme Green- and it was super fresh and tasty! They juice and blend all the fruit right when you order :)  Since there was only 1 guy working in the morning, I waited prob more than10 mins for my smoothie (due to mobile orders before mine), but he upgraded me from a medium to large drink. Great service!"}
{"text":"I love natural and healthy places to check out and today my son and I went to this new nektar! It was delicious. I want to go back and try there bowls!"}
{"text":"Love stopping here for some refreshing juices or smoothies. The staff is always helpful and polite. I've tried almost every juice and they are all delicious and healthy. Also the acai bowls are huge. Nekter has a modern decor and it is always clean. My only complaint is that the prices are steep. My medium size juice costs 7.95. And speaking of expensive, $5 for two protein poppers? Yikes! It's obviously cheaper to juice at home, but it's nice to have this as an alternative."}
{"text":"1 star for the price point and 1 for the decent taste but this location is disappointing.  The morning staff seem to hate their life and are pretty inconsistent in who they welcome and say Hi to.  Customer service isn't a complex concept.  'll pay extra at Whole Food's juice bar around the corner."}
{"text":"Loved this place! It's located in downtown Summerlin. The store is modern and very clean. The fruit and juices were so fresh! Loved the banana berry açaí bowl and the mango delight smoothie. I asked for extra granola in the bowl. It's a little pricey, but the portion size and quality is worth it. Great service and quick. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I LOVE the Acai Bowls at Nekter!!! They are far superior to Thrive and ChopShop. 

The reason for the less than 4-5 star rating is due to the amount of time it takes both to put in an order and to receive the order. Every Nekter I have been to has on only person taking orders... Even during the busy breakfast & lunch rushes!! Often times the line to order is so long it takes over 15mins just to get up to the front. And then it often takes another 20mins to receive your order. (This location seems the be far worse than the others I have frequented.) For that kind of time I could have a hot breakfast or lunch at a restaurant with table service. Often times there seems to be a lot of extra employees standing around behind the counter chatting to the employees actually working... Why aren't they helping?... Why are they distracting the employees trying to complete my order? Maybe Nekter could lower prices and improve service time if they cut back on unnecessary payroll. LoL!

I also wish they offered more that one size bowl. The current size is huge! Which is great for the price point but not when you can't finish it all without a friend. 

Regardless, I will continue to return to Nekter... Because like I said before the Acai Bowls are the best around!!"}

{"text":"Delicious smoothies!  I love the menu and staff has always provided great customer service and recommendations.  The one time I had a less than stellar experience, the Manager and District Manager went out of their way to email me and make the situation right.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I had such a nice experience at Nektar today. Mark was great, super helpful and kind. I got \"the buzz\" which is always amazing!!! Carrots, orange, lemon and ginger! With some hemp protein to round out a great breakfast  - so good! Love my cold press!"}
{"text":"The charcoal lemonade is great! My dad comes here a ton to get juices and he's done a cleanse or 2! They are affordable with tons of variety. I only wish they opened earlier so I could pop in before work."}
{"text":"Nekter is the most convenient juice location for me.  Everything they offer is really good but have had better at other juice joints. 
I struggle with 4 or 3 star rating a little.
The wait is sometimes ridiculous!!!!
If management reads this...PLEASE clean your restroom!!! It always looks gross!!!!  The seat looks like it might be stained with pee because that spot hasn't changed since I've been going here. Makes me second guess how clean other areas in the back are."}
{"text":"Found on yelp, great acai bowls. Good location too. But they should move the blenders to the back, a bit noisy inside."}
{"text":"This place is very slow compared to the one on Ray. They aren't very friendly, always understaffed and never say hi when you come in. Love the smoothies however customer service needs to improve tremendously."}
{"text":"Came here to take advantage of the FREE scoop of natural ice cream with 3 toppings last Friday. Wait was super long and they definitely should have better prepared for the crowds. Waited 20+ minutes to order and receive my food because they had to \"make\" more ice cream. Their organizational system was pretty flawed and they kept handing out the wrong orders. People that ordered more recently got their ice cream before those that were waiting for much longer. Seems like they corrected that issue once we told them they must've put the receipts in reverse order.

I tried the vanilla ice cream with strawberry, cacao chips, and hemp granola. The toppings were great but I wasn't at all a fan of the vanilla ice cream. I did hear from someone else the chocolate ice cream tastes way better. 

Prices aren't cheap at all so prepare to pay $7-10 for a juice/smoothie. They do use all fresh, natural ingredients so maybe that's worth it for some folks. I may give this place another shot at some point if I'm ever craving a healthy juice/smoothie, only because of it's convenient location within Tempe Marketplace. I'd probably skip their ice cream and go for the real deal next door."}
{"text":"I was feeling under the weather and needed something to detox my body and boost my immune system and energy. I figured that going to Nekter would do the job and it did more than just that. The girl working was very knowledgeable and patient with what I wanted/needed. I ordered the green apple detox and she recommended to add oranges, so I agreed. The drink ended up being so refreshing, I wish I ordered a size up. Thanks Nekter!"}
{"text":"I love the ginger shot! It was very delicious. The turmeric smoothie was refreshing and not too sweet, which I like. The tiny bits of mango were nice inside the smoothie. Lexi was very helpful in finding out how much sugar was in the drink. A 16 oz smoothie would be about $7, which is a lot. Yes it's natural food... but is it organic though? I'll visit again in the future."}
{"text":"When my friend and I arrived, there was only one other couple waiting already for their order. I ordered an açaí peanut butter bowl. The cashier (Miranda) misheard as a banana berry bowl. She didn't repeat the order back to me and I didn't look at my receipt so I didn't know this. The other woman (who was really nice!) asked what I had ordered after we had waited for ten minutes, and I said the peanut butter. I look at my receipt and it says banana berry, and asked if it was okay if they made the peanut butter (since I saw they were he same price anyways). Miranda made an honest mistake, and I was totally fine with it, however, Miranda is standing in the background, with a hands on hips/one eyebrow raised kind of attitude... and seems annoyed that she had to make another bowl because there was a miscommunication. Once she's done making it, she looks at me, abruptly places my bowl on the counter, and walks away. Where is the customer service? Non existent. At least with her anyways. 

The açaí bowl itself was pretty good! It was very creamy, and the peanut butter wasnt overpowering. The açaí wasnt tangy and acidic like many other places I've been to. However, my açaí was only filled less than halfway to the bowl, pretty much drowning it in granola. My friend got the banana berry and she had much more açaí with hers. 

Overall, it was okay. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"So I am not typically the type of person to walk into a juice bar but my wife is so that's why I ended up here. I honestly can't remember what she got, what it was called or what was in it but she let me try it and I was definitely surprised on how good it actually tasted. 

I don't know if I'll ever come into a place like this on my own but what I do know is if my wife takes me to a place like this I won't complain as much again"}
{"text":"This is my favorite juice bar! It's my home away from home for green Juice in the morning. Everything on the menu is healthy, delicious and refreshing. They are in NorCal, Vegas and AZ so I can trust I have a breakfast and post run/ride snack (-:"}
{"text":"Love the great deals you guys have with the gift cards right now. Staff is friendly and juice is always made fresh when you order! Love it! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I love their scoop ice cream! Both the chocolate and vanilla have great flavor and are super low calorie! 

If you're a little on the hungry side, opt for an acai bowl! My favorite right now is the Sun Devil bowl! A lot of fruit and sure to fill you up! Perfect for after a workout in the summer heat!"}
