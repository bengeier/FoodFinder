{"text":"New York City Bar and Grill is a shithole because of that loser,  so called manager named Vinny.  He is nothing but a bum.  It's amazing to me that the owner Lloyd, can't see through his bullshit.  But then again, every dog has his day; I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall... but cool.  I was there years ago and watched some of the best local musicians jam.  It was incredible.  I hear they still like to drop in but when I was there it was quiet.  Just a quick stop to see what's new.  Reasonably comfortable, gambling (video poker/keno), etc."}
{"text":"If you're looking a place that you want to relax and have a good time without all the crazy theatrics of the strip. This is the place. Make sure you see big Vinny for the full experience he is a true New Yorker who has a heart of gold and takes care of this place like no other. Don't be mistaken if you act a fool everyone will let you know. The staff here is the best and make sure to grab some pizza while you're in there. It is top notch."}
{"text":"Wow!  As manager of Scandals Salon & Day Spa, I chose this place for our Annual Holiday Party for 80 technicians and guests.  It was a blast!!!   The place was decorated like what you'd expect in downtown Manhattan, Larry cooked for us an amazing spread including his signature Sausage and Peppers (Yum!), and Janis was a great bartender.  The layout of the place was perfect for our event - we brought in a karaoke act, and tore up (in a good way) the stage and dance floor.  Can't wait to rebook for next year!"}
{"text":"Ohhhh boi!  If you like blues, this is a fabulous blues spot on Sat.  It's a hole in the wall.  But one of the guys use to write and sing with Bobby Blue Bland!  And I love me some Bobby Blue Bland!  The drinks are affordable, and the crowd is a more mature crowd!  The waitress was cool!  I will be back!  To hear some down home, southern soul blues! 
Starts at 8:30 p.m to 2;00 a.m."}
{"text":"Not a fan.
They had a karaoke night for a short time about a year or two ago, but every time the owner was in, the host had to turn the music down...almost to the point of not needing a microphone.

if you want a quiet bar, don't have a karaoke night.

I love dive bars, but this place was just seedy."}
{"text":"This is a drinkers bar. It's got plenty of TVs, a juke box, Golden Tee machines, pool tables and some couches to relax on to watch the games. NY Yankee fans will give this place 8 stars. No food here so I gave it 3."}
