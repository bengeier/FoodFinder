{"text":"To start off, there is nothing more romantic than tiny French restaurant in the middle of a francophone city with some beautiful night rain. 

To add to this, the service of this place was beyond excellent. Not everyone was comfortable with English but they still managed to understand and communicate. The lady server was so helpful and friendly. 

Being a vegetarian I had limited if not \"no\" options going to a French restaurant, but they managed to get me some brilliant sweet potato and ginger soup followed by a dense salad and bread with different kinds of cheese. And to top it off - one of the creamiest desserts I have had. 

This place is a must \"go-to\"."}
{"text":"Nourriture excellente. J'ai bien aimé la bavette que j'ai commandée. Bon rapport qualité prix: 21$ pour entrée, repas, dessert et cafe. 

Ambiance a la fois chic et décontractée. Joli décor, terrasse agréable.

J'y reviendrais sans hésitation."}
{"text":"Decided to give this cute place a try after getting sick of super expensive tourist food and I'm glad we did!  It's a little bit tucked away in a quiet residential neighborhood but the food, the service, and the general ambience (diners are mostly local families and couples) were all quite lovely. It does justice to its mission statement of providing French food at a good price: A full 3 course meal (soup/salad, entree, dessert and coffee/tea) runs less than 20$ and the wine list is reasonably priced as well. The food is solid--can't say I'm a connoisseur but I enjoyed my duck confit as much as one I had in Paris and my family members all liked their food, as well. The host/waiters were friendly and had great timing--we never felt like we were waiting for long or were rushed. Slight imperfections (a wilted salad leaf, a dropped glass) keep this place from a total 5 star review but it's close enough... Would give it 4.5 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Very glad I found this little French bistro tucked away in the Rosemont area. While unassuming the dining experience is excellent. Had braised veal with brie for my main course -- really fantastic; would definitely order it again -- and it can't up with a delicious soup, cheesecake and a coffee for dessert. And the price is hard to beat: my whole meal came to under $24. The service was excellent (especially given that I don't speak or read French!) and the atmosphere was relaxed yet elegant. Overall I would highly recommended this place."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in the neighborhood, 22 dollar full course meal with appetizer and dessert. Would definitely visit it again !"}
{"text":"This resto is somewhat off the beaten path -- it's not in a particularly touristy neighborhood, and its exterior is so unassuming that you might just miss it if you weren't looking for it. However, La Menthe Poviree is such a neighborhood gem that I wished I lived close by so I could make this a regular casual dinner spot. 

Most of the menu is three course prix fixe: salad, main, and a small dessert. First, we decided to split an order of escargots gratinee, which arrived bubbling hot, brothy, and cheesy. Delicious. The mixed greens salads were also great: fresh and lightly dressed. My entree, however, was a total standout: pork loin in a rich wine sauce, potatoes, and haricots. Awesome. Even the dessert (poached pear) was great.  Best yet, the price is super-affordable: my three course meal (not counting the escargots) was under $20. 

Service was really great, though I'll admit being a little put off in the beginning because I got a weird vibe from the maitre'd when he noticed we didn't speak French and we didn't have a reservation. (Oh, yeah: pro tip: come early, or make a reservation. The place was PACKED at 6:00pm on a weekday!). However, he warmed up to us and the service was quite excellent after, even if he giggled a little at my really awful French. :)"}
