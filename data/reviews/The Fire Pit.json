{"text":"The burgers here are delicious,  the poutine taste great as well. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Been going to this place for forever now new owners took over and the place is starting to take a dive I always get fried onions in my poutine this time was told they don't do it and wouldn't recommend it. Seriously?? How hard is it to shut up and put some stupid fried onions in or on the poutine regardless of what you recommend just do it and charge me extra!! never going back again"}
{"text":"Service is horrible, food is alright.. 
The staff is rude and they look miserable, seriously quit or shutdown the place.
It's disgusting when they touch your burger with their bare hands while putting on the toppings"}
{"text":"Read the reviews: VERY Disappointed!!

I think I've had better beef (if thats what they call it) out of the vending machine at work.  

- Fries way overcooked
- Everything very greasy
- Wasn't a good eat-in atmosphere
- Sandwich preparer was cleaning with his rag and stopped to put some onions from the countertop back in the bowl for next customer requests.

Quality of food to me.....made Wendy's look like a top notch place. I try to fully support local mom & pop shops but steer clear folks..... 

I will say the staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"Ate theyre poutine. Love the general vibe of the restaurant, the food is a bit greasy but makes for a great late night snack and they make it fresh! Loved the onion ring topped on the fries."}
{"text":"This is my favourite burger restaurant out of all that I have been to. I'm not a huge burger fan but the ones here are delicious and also love their fries and gravy. Staff are always very friendly too."}
{"text":"Everyone is doing poutine now but the poutine they sell is better then other restaurants. No cheese curds on the poutine but the gravy and the fries taste great. If you feel really hungry upgrade your combo to a poutine !"}
{"text":"This place disgusts me, I witnessed a manager fire an employee after he discovered she had a disability, I overheard their conversation and was absolutely disgusted with what I heard. The poor girl was in tears.

Save your money and don't spend it here where the managers have no dignity and should definitely be charged with discrimination. 

The food isn't even that great anyways."}
{"text":"Burgers were good. Prices are fair. Service is terrible. Extremely rude. I havent been back since."}
{"text":"If you're looking for something quick to fill your belly this place will fit that bill but that would be about it. 
I ordered the pork souvlaki with Greek salad, the pork was dry and tasteless the tazitki sauce was boring the rice was overcooked and bland. The Greek salad was the saving grace of the entire plate. I understand how this is a late night after bar restaurant but unless you're drinking I wouldn't suggest.
If you're in Mississauga and looking for good Souvlaki drive past this place and go to Zet's on Airport Road, they are much better."}
{"text":"Pros:
-Open very late
-Local business
-Fast, fresh food
-Wide selection
-Good portions
-Free refills
-Adequate prices
-Good staff

Cons:
-Setting is not great, it looks like a school cafeteria. Not too clean either.
-Onion ring and fries are way too greasy.
-Stay away from non-traditional menu items.
-Good burger, but just above average. Chicken sandwich is its best item.
-Cheap buns."}
{"text":"When I want a greasy, thanksgiving dinner kind of feeling in my gut-THIS is where I go. 

Great burgers and poutine (topped with an onion ring!) in Mississauga imo.

The cooks are friendly and great at what they do, even though they may look as greasy as the food itself. Give it a try! You'll thank me"}
{"text":"Amazing food fast service!

Get the Combo #1 with 1/4 burger with homefries (which includes 1 huge onion ring) and drink for only $6.80 (not including tax)!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for cheap eats and it's open late. It's not a flashy place and it doesn't look like much on the inside either, but it's worth the stop in.

I usually get either the burger combo or the chicken kebob with the salad and the food is flavorful and decently portioned. Sometimes it's a little too oily, but it doesn't taste bad. There is variety on the menu too so you don't have to pigeonhole yourself into one type of food if you're not in the mood for it.

There are quite a few seats both in the front and the back. The woman from big fat Greek wedding also went there apparently, and they have a newspaper article with her in it on the wall. 

When it's 12/ 1 in the morning and you don't want drive thru fare, this place is a good alternative if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. I travel and eat everywhere across North America and this is in my top 10 for burger joints.  They build the burgers for you on the spot and ,as the sign reads, they do not own a microwave. Quality fast food."}
{"text":"I love this place, i always get a large strawberry old fashioned, and they always remember that i do. The food is always top class, and the employees are kind and welcoming."}
{"text":"Nothing out of the ordinary about this place, but def fills you up quite nice. For $13.00 a plate, you will get you a skewer (chkn souvlaki) , rice/fries/onion rings,salad and a pita plus a drink. 
The food type is mostly Mediterranean & Greek. 
They are very generous with the portions so feel free to split a plate between 2. 

The venue itself is odd. When you walk in there's 2 sets of booths to your right, then a long hall to the cash/order taking area. Then the area opens up to the left with more tables/chairs. The bathrooms are along the hall, towards the entrance. 

I come here if I am craving a hearty lunch/dinner. The line up is quite fast and the cooks are extra friendly to the ladies. 
It's the 2nd restaurant I've been to in Mississauga that has cook/kitchen-customer interaction. I enjoy this. 

Parking is free but it's a terrible hassle. Make sure to drive slowly into this tiny lot to avoid any accidents. Also, this area is very high volume so traffic is almost always an issue.

{"text":"Oh my god. I just ordered a poutine which comes with an onion ring on top. I save the onion ring for the end because it's usually too hot to eat right away. When I went to take a bite of it, there was a long, thick black hair in the batter, fried right in. The owner didn't care, said he wouldn't give me my money back because I ate the potine. Had I seen the hair, I wouldn't have eaten it!! 

So gross. So, so gross. Makes me think of what else goes on back there, this place used to be one of the best in town.  Poor ownership,  poor customer service. Poor hygiene. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I tried the burger and onion rings and stole a couple fries off my colleague's tray. The fries are fresh and handcut. They are reminiscent of a chip truck fry. Pretty good. The onion rings are fresh and hand battered. The batter is pretty thick and somewhat doughy - kind of like a hush puppy dough. They're not the best onion rings I've ever had, but they are pretty tasty.

The burger, unfortunately, was a frozen patty burger. It hit the spot because I was famished, but I can't reward a top rating to a frozen burger. It's really not that hard to make a fresh burger. 

The driveway is so close to the intersection at Hurontario and Britannia so it can be very tricky to navigate when traffic is busy."}
{"text":"Update review: still coming to this place pretty much when I can, and I've never had a chicken souvlaki dinner like the one they serve here. The chicken is cooked fresh along with the salad, fries and rice. The  tzatziki sauce they give you for the chicken is delicious as well. This place is seriously amazing and I can't wait to go back. The prices have gone up just a tad bit but I don't mind. 

Overall this place is top notch and I don't think it can get any better. I believe it changed my life and made me see life in a different way. I love you."}
{"text":"If you are starving and in Mississauga, go to this place because their portions are huge! We always get the chicken souvlaki dinner. And it comes with rice, greek salad,fries, toasted bread bun and their signature one onion ring on top."}
{"text":"This place has been around for as long as I can remember. The Fire Pit was first introduced to me back in high school, as one of those 'late-night' 'after club drunk' must-go places to be. And that's what most sauga people know the establishment as.

However, drunk or sober, their food is good! (Yes, I've reconfirmed my taste buds here on not-so-drunk nights. ) 

Wally's, on Central Pkwy & Hurontario, is a well-known diner too. However, I prefer the food here. 

What should you get at The Fire Pit? Their souvlaki is amazing. Their burgers are pretty good, their poutines are bomb, and almost everything comes w/ that ONE signature onion ring. I wouldn't bother getting a steak though. 

There's no worrying about portions here. And if you're going to order a poutine, they drench theirs with gravy. Half way through ours, there was still a pool of gravy at the bottom. Oh my heart. 

For my fellow yelpers critiquing the cleanliness of the joint, it was pretty clean even the past few times I've went. Plus it's a diner, come on! Still much cleaner in comparison to Wally's and Master Steak. 

Open super late! Which is hard to find in the west end here. But you happen to drop by during the day, it'll be much quieter and free of drunk clubbers coming from My Apartment. Check it out!"}
{"text":"its food for those drunken bar hopping or after club nights, if you ever show up sober
you will not go back...the food sucks....IMO"}
{"text":"I love this place, my son loves this place, and pretty much any person I brought here loves this place. Their burgers and onion rings are the best in town, and their poutine is excellent. Even better when you add fried onions on top."}
{"text":"Looking at these pictures looks great! But the 2 /3 guys working there are very impatient, especially when you ask something specifically! They need a female working at cash! They don't give best customer service especially at night!

Ps: guy working there got mad because I asked him to wash his hands!"}
{"text":"I was craving a steak sandwich and this place just happened to be on the way to where i was going.  As i was placing my order, i had a friendly chat with the person on cash.  I didnt have to wait long for my order to be ready.  The fried onions on the steak was a nice touch.  The fries were decent.  I will be back I'm sure but its a bit of an awkward location depending on which direction you are headed.  Next time i think i will give the souvlaki a try.  I suppose i would have enjoyed my visit a bit more if the two guys sitting at the table behind me would not speak so loud in a foreign language and most of all if they would shower.  But we dont juge the establishment on the clientel so 3 stars, the food was decent."}
{"text":"This place is great especially since it's opened late at night.  It serves amazing food after a night of partying at a baby shower.  Me and friend stopped by at this place around 01:00 am as we were very hungry.  We both ordered a cheese burger and fries.  The meal was great and filling.  One thing I would say is that the amount of fries could have been more as it came in a small box.  Overall, the best place for food after a late night when hunger hits!"}
{"text":"Steak on a Kaiser.   

This place is so good and the staff are so friendly as well.  You are looking to spend about 10 bucks for a meal but it is so filling and tasty.  You get these huge burgers with all fresh toppings and some great bread.  The location is good and the dining is nice and comfortable.  If you are a burger man then this is your kinda place.  Don't forget about the Big Pit Burger too!  So good!"}
{"text":"The heartattack pit! Can we rename this place? Cafe style venue with metal tables and chairs that look like the will break. I got the gyros combo which comes with fries and drink. I opted for onion rings which is $.60 additional and got a bottle water as well. The gyro had 5 slivers of something meat and it's placed in a wrap with a head of lettuce, a mitt full of onions and a whole tomato. To top it off, mentioned gyros is now over packed with too many veggies so the food is now impossible to wrap as there are too many ingredients in the gyros - to solve the issues they put a rubber band around it once in the foil paper wrapping. So many things wrong with this picture. Can you order bigger bread pita things to hold all the contents? Why is the meat dark as night, do we really need a mitt full of onions? The best part, the onionrings has a sliver of an onion, ring - with about an inch of batter surrounding it! So again I find myself asking, who eats like this? Luckily I have hungry coworkers who ate the onion rings and a hungry garbage can which ate more than half the lettuce, onions and tomatoes so I can properly wrap what was leftover!  Maybe other options on their menu board from the 80's are better... but gyro... skip!"}
{"text":"I like the burgers here... and the fries and gravy.  The souvlaki is a tad bland and not my favourite thing on the menu.  The service is quick, it's usually packed around lunch on a weekday. I come here when I want a burger and fries."}
{"text":"It's a great old school burger, steak and souvlaki place. Large (too large) portions. Great fries. Seating pretty tight at lunch time. Great prices"}
{"text":"It's a local business, and I like going here. I like some items, and do not like others. I want to support the competitive advantage of The Fire Pit by listing the food I think they do well.

-burgers
-homestyle burgers
-chicken in a pita
-fries
-greek salad"}
{"text":"OK who doesn't know the Fire Pit.  There used to be many of these places around in the 90's.  Unfortunately this is the only one left.  Any one who lives is Mississauga knows this place is open real late on the weekends.  Prime place after partying in the Sauga area.  I am not going to say that its the best burger joint in town but it is pretty good.  I mean where else in that area can you get a decent burger or souvlaki.  Haven't really tried anything other than a burger and fries at the Fire Pit so I can't really judge on anything else.  Burger is tasty and juicy.  Fries are great and love how when you order fries they give you 1 huge onion ring on top.  Good touch.  Different is key.  Will definitely return to this location."}
{"text":"It taste so fucking goooooddddd and get the chicken souvlaki dinner it's fucking bomb!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is ok at best, except for their onion rings and poutine, they're pretty good. Very tasty gravy, however they use shredded mozzarella and purists hate that on poutine, but it is what it is. however fire pit  is one of the few open late, so you can't ask for much. I find it to be a bit overpriced as well. Overall a decent place when you're trying to find something at 2 am"}
{"text":"The only thing decent about this place is the hours its open and the low prices . Thats where the good stops !! The burger I had was horrible , I thought oh sweet a nice flame broiled burger , instead I quickly realized why it was so cheap .... The quality of beef used was that of a mediocre cafeteria just utter dog food!! I also ordered a chocolate shake which that was even less than satisfying. , I mean come on people how the hell do u screw up a milkshake?? Stay away or go to Wendy's across the street!"}
{"text":"I heard this place used to be good.   Well, now, it is OKKKK.   I had the pork suvulaki & salad dinner.  The salad was surprisingly good with plenty of bell peppers, onion, cheese, and decent dressing.  The meat was nothing special, and they threw in a small bread.  For $13, I could have eaten better somewhere else.  A friend of my got the suvulaki dinner with rice, fries in addition to what I got.  I think my friend commented how big the portion was and he can take the left over home - he paid about $15, before the soda he ordered.   If you are on a budget, and you are ok with ok food, with decent amount of food to eat, and take left over home, then this might be the place for you.  But honestly, if you are paying $15/plate, you need to find yourself somewhere better than this place.  The whole atmosphere is dead, the people who work there look miserable, and food is ok.  I cannot even argue this place has good value, given what my friend and I paid to eat here.  Does Mississauga need another burger & Greek joint serving what other 30-40 restaurants in the are doing the same?   Even if they just clean up the place, add better lighting, play some good music, this place would be a better dining experience for the patrons.  Until then, I would pass on this place, unless you enjoy a depressing experience.

{"text":"I had eaten here before, and, tried it again.  This location seems to cater to the Business Lunch crowd (me), and, the after the bar crowd (was me 10 years ago - LOL).  It's legit.  The owners are Greek, and, their menu is big.  I had a hamburger (which was delicious).  Next time I am going the try the Gyros (which the guy behind the counter ensured me they are 'the best'!).  With passion like that - I will be back.  Thanks for lunch guys"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice but that's all I need to say that the burgers, poutine, and Greek salad are amazing. 

It's your typical burger and souvlaki joint that's been around for 30 years. The burgers have been recommended to me as some of the best burgers in Mississauga - and they are, for the price. At only $5 and change, the banquet burger is essentially a large bacon cheeseburger. Luckily for me, that's all I ordered. Its size was much larger than other burgers at a fraction of the price. 

The second time I went, I had the Greek salad upon recommendation from one of my Greek friends. I'll have to seek her recommendations more often, as this was as good as it gets. Don't bother ordering the large size, the regular size is enough to fill your plate. I also got the regular poutine after seeing how good it looked. While it doesn't compare to more specialized poutine spots, this was equally as fulfilling and even had a large onion ring on top - a nice touch.

The food here is great, but what's even better are their hours. They're open as late as 4am on weekends! I think I have a new late night spot to go to in Mississauga. I'm glad I found The Fire Pit."}
{"text":"It was probably 1 am when I started craving some souvlaki so obviously I had to drag my boyfriend out for some greek food. When we walked in one of the staff was vacuuming. The restaurant is impressively clean! All the tables were wiped down and they had a bunch of seating available. 

We both got chicken souvlaki dinner plates. His with the upgrade for the poutine for like $1.75 or something and mine with onion rings for only 0.60. We also shared a chocolate milkshake (which tasted like Neapolitan ice cream, wasn't a fan of it)

The chicken was delish!! Surprisingly not dry at all and the rice and salad was perfect accompanying the chicken. And the portions were huge enough that I packed it up and ate it for lunch the next day. 

I would definitely come back if I was craving some souvlaki past midnight."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! every time I'm near Toronto it's a must stop. Nothing fancy but great Greek food.  My fav is the \"Steak on a Kaiser\" loaded with sautéed mushrooms and Onions. ... and steak too big for bun...attention all other Greek restraints in VA - do you have this on the menu?????? Because it sucks have to drive to Toronto for this feast! My son likes the Chicken Slovakia on a bun.  They have fresh cut fries and top with a giant onion ring. Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Good burgers. Wish they used smaller buns, quite often our burgers would keep falling apart as we ate them. 

Service was good and our food was made very quickly and correctly. Will recommend. Last visit was in spring 2014. 

Parking spaces is limited because it is located in a small plaza."}
{"text":"Came to your restaurant hoping to get some food but your website said open till 2. Showed up and your store said open till 10. Looked on Google and said closed for Sunday.  Please fix your hours."}
{"text":"Got VERY ill after eating here. Asked the guys if everything on the veggie plate was vegetarian, they said yes. I asked 3 times and he said yes. On my plate was salad, rice, and french fries. My guess is that something was fried/mixed with meat and I became very painfully ill for the remainder of the day because of their lies. Understandably, this is a meat joint. But vegetarians come here with their friends who do eat meat and if something is deemed to be vegetarian they should be able to eat it. Never coming to this place again."}
{"text":"Great little place for burgers, souvlaki, or other specialties like steak on a kaiser. Open late (until 4 am on Friday) when everything else is closed. It's basically a Greek takeout place with burgers and other items on the menu. Nice little dining area with a Greek feel to it. It's located in a small plaza at a very busy intersection, but there's still decent parking space. Check it out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Above average greasy spoon style food with super late hours to boot..

They make an *excellent* Greek salad with a ton of optional toppings you never see anywhere else, including all 4 kinds of peppers!  Red, yellow, orange, green.  Radishes, red onions, you name it, they've got it

I recommend their steak on a kaiser, pork souvlaki, chicken fillet dinner, or gyro's on a pita.

However I do NOT like their chicken souvlaki because they do a very very poor job of butchering it, and you always end up with a nasty gristly piece that is a result of them not trimming their chicken breasts properly..  Almost like they don't want to waste that extra tiny bit of chicken which in reality is doing them more harm than good, because people won't order it again

They've got fresh cut fries which are awesome. 

And their beer battered thick onion rings are definitely worth getting as well.  Both homemade daily, and fried to order.

Closed Sundays."}
{"text":"This place does a great chicken souvlaki plate.

Generous on the salad -- lots of feta cheese and a rich sauce.  Quite a variety of vegetables too.

Seem to do decent burgers too.

The fact that this isn't a horrible franchise like most take-away joints in Toronto gives it an extra star.  Bring back individuality and family businesses in food service!!

The chicken is pretty decent... and the fact it's open until 4am Fri/Sats is awesome."}
{"text":"I like their burgers and souvlaki a lot, but the reason I come here is they have the best fries and gravy.  Onion rings are also up there... which is why you might want to order the frings.  Even if you don't they make a habit of giving you one or two rings with a fries order so you can try them.  That is confidence right there and deservedly so."}
{"text":"Great service. Their veal sandwich is amazing. And open late too which is always great. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today after accidentally finding this place when I was in town with a work colleague in August. We wanted to go to Quiznos but it was shut down!  Very interesting place. I'd call this a Greek themed greasy spoon. Today I did not want heavy grease so I had a Greek salad with Donair meat. Very nice fresh salad and the Donair meat was greasy and tasty good. Also this was just over $13 with drink so I was happy. Everyone else was ordering steak sandwich and fries and burgers. You know a good greasy spoon when most clientele are all guys!"}
{"text":"Okay, the grill is okay.  The burgers/souvlaki are tasty and enjoyable.  

But I'm not here to talk about the burgers.  No. 

I'm here to talk about the rings. 

I stop in for lunch.  Get a burger combo, decide to try the rings. 

Heaven.  Little (and by little, I mean huge) circles of deep fried heaven.  

They're, first and foremost, light.  Not densely breaded, not thick, not hard to handle.  LIttle halos of joy.  If there was a hamburger saint, he'd have these rings over his head as a symbol of divine grace. 

They're fried, but they aren't greasy. So important, that.  And they're big.  You only get six or seven, but they're all a mouthful.  

The burger was good.  The pop was reconstituted sugar water.  But these rings will get me back in, and soon.  

So good. So so good.  The five stars are for the rings."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the first time it was me and one other customer but the second time it was a lot busier. Both times I got the crispy chicken sandwich and an order of fries. The fries come with 1 onion ring it's a fire pit signature. 

The sandwich is great, I always get it with hot sauce and its always the perfect kick to the sandwich. It tastes so much fresher then a chicken sandwich from Wendy's or McDonald's. Its always made fresh to order so I know it hasn't been sitting around.The fries and onion ring are always cooked to perfection. They aren't overly greasy or soggy. The meal fills me up and its a great lunch.

They're open late so if you're looking for a late night bite, I haven't been here for late night food but I'm sure I'll be here eventually. I will be coming here for more lunches and I hope to try different things on the menu. I will update my review as I try more items."}
{"text":"Every late night visit to this place has always been a pleasant experience. The staff is friendly, food is good and it's opened late which is really convenient."}
{"text":"Wear gloves please!  I don't appreciate seeing you wipe the counter with ur hands and then make my burger filthy. I dont want to think of other filth going on in the kitchen

Will not return. Burger is so overrated. I'm not even sure if it wad really beef I was eatting"}
{"text":"Came by here on a lunch break.  Still has the same menu since back in the days.  One thing I've noticed is the lack of customer's on lunch time.  I recall coming here 8 years ago and the line up to buy was huge.  I guess a lot has change probably new management??? I got the hamburger combo cost about $7.75 pretty much on par with prices and fast food restaurants. Cheaper than specialty burger joints so thats good to know.  Ive upgraded to a poutine side to go along with combo for extra $2. Id imagune if did this at a burger specialty restaurant i would be $15-20 in the hole by now.  Toppings are done as pee your instructions, i asked for sauteed/glazed onions i was told that cost extra. Hmmmm didnt know caramelized onions was such the luxury price hike.  Anyways the poutine was a good portion and the they always put their signature  onion ring on their fries or poutine.  I would definitely come back again the burger was tasty.  I would give them a 3.5 star for if that is possible.  Still has that throw back feel when i come here. Last time i was here probanbly over 5 years ago.  I'll probably pop in again within the end of the year. Check it out if your ever around."}
{"text":"My favourite late night place but great at any time! Grilled chicken burger is a personal favourite. Chicken Souvlaki on a bun/dinner or pita are all great. Steak on a Kaiser also great but messy. Fries are amazing regular or poutine, either is great! Portion sizes are large as well"}
{"text":"My all time fav Burger joint & love the souvlaki on a bun & home-fries!!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes it's the small things that a restaurant does that makes a difference. The previous owners were amazing, the food was consistent, and the owners literally kept the same staff. Now new owners have purchased this joint. The first thing I noticed were that prices went up right across the board, and the servings have gotten smaller, and more importantly, customer service levels have dropped. This is not the same restaurant I used to love and patronize. After spending $16 for a pork dinner and tipping the cashier, I realized that I forgot to order a small tiny cup of gravy. The previous owners always gave that to me. When I asked the server (who I am guessing was the owner) He advised that I had to line up and pay for it. Are you kidding me? So I am in a rush, and have to line up again and wait for 3 people to pay a lousy $1 for a micro cup of gravy lol.  There is actually a Mr Greek just down the street from here, that has now won my business, and I have gone to the Firepit for the last time. So in addition to raising prices and giving me less pork on my dinner, I am now getting dinged for another loonie lol. Good-bye Firepit."}
{"text":"I can't count the number of times I've been here, or the number of friends I've brought here who hadn't been. Great good and the hours make for a great combo and the staff are just awesome. 

The steak on a kaiser is great and the onion rings are little slices of deep fried deliciousness. As long as i'm in the GTA, i'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"I just never get enough of this place. There are three things that I may possibly order depending on my mood, and I am always, always, *always* in the mood for at least one of them.

It is no secret that the suburbs are bereft of interesting and tasty independently-owned eating establishments. I mean, there's a few, but seriously...there's a *few*. This is one of my few. The Fire Pit goes down in my personal history as pretty much being my first exposure to fast food of the anti-McDonald's variety. The original location very near my childhood home disappeared at least 10 years ago, so imagine my joy when this place sprouted up sometime later (maybe 5?). My old friend had been brought back to life. 

Though I am too old to have my mother drive me everywhere, once I am out of the downtown core...well, she does (I don't drive, ok?). When she is feeling particularly generous, and I am feeling particularly greedy, I manage to swing a ride over here. If you don't have a mom as awesome as mine, you just might not make it into Mississauga to enjoy the bounty, and that would be a shame. The burgers are fantastic, but it is usually the glorrrrrious steak sandwich and extras-laden souvlaki that I struggle over committing to each visit. Everything is just so plentiful, juicy and tasty (the one thing-- the rice that comes with the souvlaki is kind of plain, but I don't really mind since it kind of plays backdrop to everything else, soaking up the other flavours), that going there always feels like some kind of magical treat. I'm so serious.

Last but not least: the service. Best service I have ever had, anywhere. The whole staff is incredibly friendly (I know them pretty well by this time, but they were like that before I did...), always chatting, joking and topping burgers, salad and whatever else with about twice as much garnishes as most people do (when prodded, even). Anybody who puts five pickle slices on my burger without my asking is obviously my guardian angel."}
{"text":"Rude staff they make fun of customers in there native language and pass dirty comments about girls, the food is all frozen box meat the place sucks!!"}
