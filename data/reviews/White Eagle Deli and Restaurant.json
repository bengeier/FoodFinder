{"text":"I was so excited to go to a restaurant that had advertised European food with \"live\" entertainment. My family arrived at the restaurant at 6 pm on a Saturday night.. We ordered our dinners including Hungarian Goulash. The waitress stated that the kitchen was closing and they didn't have time to make the Hungarian Goulash. Really?????? You are closing the kitchen at 6:15pm on a Saturday night? Well, they didn't have the ingredients to make the Goulash. 10 people came in after us and ordered meals. Humm..... 
The beef stroganoff tasted like the Costco special and the \"live\" entertainment was a 1 man band. He actually did a great job. I would not recommend the restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Tried out Eddie's Bistro for lunch on Friday with kids in tow.  The atmosphere was comfortable, and the live music entertained the baby (and us all).  We had the pork sandwich special and the corned beef rueben, which was delicious!  The rye was soft, meat sliced thin, and just the right amount of kraut & dressing.  We shall be back for more!

Service was a mite slow, but we didn't mind, and the prices are a tad high."}
{"text":"Ah, the White Hair Deli. It has some promise because the food is quite good, but it seems to have contented itself with catering to the retirees who can get to dinner and be home by 6pm on a weekday. Which is fine, because that is the neighborhood they are in."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm absolutely, positively, well and truly DONE with this place. Last night (Wednesday) we had arranged with friends to meet there for dinner at 6:45pm. When we got there (6:45pm) there was a CLOSED sign in the window -- AGAIN! I've mentioned the ridiculous business hours before - such as taking Sunday off to celebrate the fact that it comes after Saturday etc. It seems that they have all new business hours, and what I read has permanently lost them four customers.

Closed Monday and Tuesday (?!) Wednesday open 11am-3pm (!?) Thursday open 11am-8pm. That's basically as far as I bothered to read.

This restaurant can go to hell - that's the third time I've arrived at a completely appropriate time of the evening only to have the place inexplicably closed.  I don't care about the recent renovations and frankly there are way too many other delicious places around to be bothered severely adjusting schedules and timing to get into this place during the three or four hours a week that they could be BOTHERED to open. Screw them.

EDIT 20120925: Apparently they've changed the name of this place to \"Eddie's European Bistro\". A lot of time has passed since I got the sh1ts with them; I MAY decide to return and see if anything's improved. If they're closed once more that'll be IT though."}
{"text":"To let you know! This place is a hit and miss place!! Food is great, But you need to get there when they are open! When we are able to find this place open, we just love the food. And since I raised their rating to 4, that is only because they were opened again!! I have had their meatloaf sandwich, cheese burger, vegi sandwich, chicken, and pork Schnitzel. I have yet to have a bad plate. I always tried to get something different every time I come here. But I may only order their Pork Schnitzel for now on. One of my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"The really do have some of the best peirogies in town. Their stuffed cabage is also wonderful with a tomato cream sauce on it. Comming from a Polish family I tend to be very picky about my Polish cuisine. this place deinfately did not disspoint!"}
{"text":"I LOVE White Eagle Deli.  The food is fantastic - the stuffed cabbage is delightfully delicate and the potatoe pancakes are heavenly.  If you don't like their hours, make your schedule work to meet theirs.  The Polka on Friday and Saturday nights is a fantastic show and the brave couples dancing will warm your heart.  This is a DO NOT MISS if you are anywhere near Surprise, AZ."}
{"text":"Deli? Not so much, although there is the obligatory little counter filled with a selection of smoked meats. But that's just dandy with me, because this restaurant does Polish food very well. 

The White Eagle is not a particularly pretty place. It's ensconced in a strip mall and the decor is utilitarian with dim lighting. But the aromas wafting from the kitchen are what truly matter here. For a reasonable price, you can down heaping portions of authentic Polish/Eastern European cuisine, just like grandma made it. 

If you're new to this food, one of the tastiest ways to try a little of everything is the restaurant's special platter, which introduces several favorites in ample portions, including a divine, chewy smoked Polish sausage, a cabbage roll with savory meat and rice filling topped with a creamy tomato gravy, three pirogis with a variety of fillings, real mashed potatoes, and several slices of light rye bread with butter. But the platters true star is something called sauerkraut stew, which elevates pickled cabbage to something special, with bits of meat, onion, tomato, and seasonings. 

For those who prefer something less ethnic, the Eagle does a great rendition of schnitzel, in both pork and chicken versions, which are pounded until tender and falling off the plate. 

Breakfast options are also on the menu, as well as single item plates from the platter's bounty, and more basic dinner favorites. 

Soups usually include a hot (temp) version of borscht, with beets, beans, meat, carrots and cream, as well as other broth based potions that are perfect on a cold December day. 

Service is polite and friendly. Though we've never been there to enjoy it, live music is offered on weekends. Weekdays, the tv is often tuned to the Food Network...just fine with me. 

Home baked desserts are offered, but look closely in the case before you order...more than once I've noticed that the gorgeous cakes have gone a little green. No matter. We generally leave here stuffed and with leftovers!"}
{"text":"I've come to the realization that some of the best restaurants are squished into shopping centers.

White Eagle is a little polish deli that has a lot in a small area.

In the back corner is a little market where you can get Scandinavian, Polish, German...etc. sweets and goodies.  In the front corner is the restaurant part, and opposite is the deli counter that holds all sorts of yummy desserts, deli meats, and fresh baked breads.

I've taken the breads home plenty of times.  Crusty on the outside, soft and squishy in the middle.  Best of both worlds.  The desserts are the best, and my favorite is a little heavenly number which is yet un-named...  It's a sandwich of light soft pastry that has layers like filo, but is much lighter...with a middle of the fluffiest custard cream.  Just sweet enough.

Then you get to the menu, littered with various hunter's stews, schnitzels, and probably the best pierogies I've tasted.  They have three kinds:  meat and rice, potato and cheese, and of course sauerkraut and mushrooms.  The latter two are my favorite.  One order comes with 9 pieces, and you can mix and match.

The restaurant is family owned, and every one of them are friendly and will answer any of your questions.

They close at 3:30pm and are closed on Sundays.  I haven't tried breakfast there yet...but it sounds appetizing."}
