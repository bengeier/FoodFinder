{"text":"It so rare to find somewhere that the food is both fat and amazing. My husband and I dropped in for breakfast and were very pleasantly surprised. He had their #1 Waffle special and their waffles were amazing!! They were light, fluffy, and flavorful. I had the Ultimate Herb breakfast which consisted of eggs, onions, peppers, potatoes cheese, ham sausage, and bacon all scrambled together. It was ridiculously good. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"This is just a fun place. Good food and great service! The workers are easy going and interactive with the customers. You can really tell its a place where the locals come.   The food delish - normal diner food. For the area, you get a lot for your dollars (Solon can be pricey).  The only knock is a lack of seating.  If you come at lunch, be prepared to wait for a table or counter seat. I suppose it adds to the experience, but can be a hassle if you're on a lunch hour."}
{"text":"Small Friendly Family owned and operated. The kind of breakfast place I look for. Wish I didn't live an hour away."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! I always love coming here and getting a western omelet, so much better than Bob Evans, probably my no.1 place to get breakfast!"}
{"text":"Super legit brunch spot, with old school hospitality and music playing through the speakers. I usually go with the Jack Special which is eggs, hash browns, toast, and bacon [or sausage if you want].  The flat grille cooks up everything in the way a buttery diner is supposed to.  Lunch selections like sandwiches are there too.  Heather is super nice and very attentive."}
{"text":"Always a great atmosphere. Great simle breakfast. I love you can smell their cookings from the parking lot. Love their hash browns!!!"}
{"text":"Under $10 for a great breakfast. Fast! Seating is tight but hey, rub elbows with someone at the counter. A go-to greasy spoon with do-wap in the air and a decent plate."}
{"text":"This place is awesome with amazing food!  It's a 50s style dinner that serves lunch and breakfast.  Staff is very nice and attentive even when super busy.  I've been here three times now and every meal was great.  Everyone should try their home fries, you might want to get a half order since the full is so huge.  Also the monte cristo sandwich is superb and comes with a delicious dipping sauce. Any of your standard breakfast items are going to be great, whether it's a waffle, egs, or anything in between.   If you are in the are definitely give it a go but bring cash since they don't take cards and come early since they close at 2pm on weekdays and 1pm on the weekend."}
{"text":"Found this great little place while driving through Solon. Small cozy diner with great food at great prices! My husband and I had the corn beef hash, ultimate herb Nelson, and a blueberry pancake. Quick service and delicious. Tip - they only take cash but there is an ATM inside."}
{"text":"Jim's in Solon, is a small restaurant and space is a premium, consisting of a series of small booths and counter seating.  You must understand \"Turning their tables\" is crucial for their staff to earn a living.   At peak breakfast and lunch hours, you could have trouble finding a booth.  Rest assured that the staff will go to great lengths, even beyond the bounds of customer service, to get you seated as quickly as possible, fed with great food, and out the door."}
{"text":"I genuinely love this place. It's a small diner with limited seating but it's constantly bustling with people. The food here is inexpensive and very filling. They practically cook it right in front of you and it has a homemade taste. I honestly wish there were more places like this around still. I recommend this place to anyone that is passing through in the morning when you want a good hardy breakfast and not fast food."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in cleveland.  An old fashion 50's diner with old fashioned good food.  Try the Herb Nelson,  eggs, onions, hash browns, and cheese  put together on the griddle, heaven on the plate. People are friendly, the Cheers Bar of breakfast where everyone knows your name. The place is nothing fancy and a bit kitschy, but it just makes for a great dining experience. Don't miss this place if you are on the east side of suburban cleveland."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my meal. I had a patty melt and home fries; their potatoes reminded me of my dad's Lyonnaise potatoes, ie, pan-fried thinly-cut potatoes. My husband had an omelet that he really dug. (He almost never orders omelets, because he doesn't trust people to cook them properly, so it was good stuff.) Our service was prompt and friendly; someone who seemed like the owner or a manager was training a new person, and he was really nice to her. I like that. Nice people are rad.  It's a 50's-ish diner but without the faux kitsch of a corporate chain; it feels homey, like going somewhere that your grandma or grandpa took you when you were little. The menu is pretty typical; I wasn't surprised by anything. Sometimes that's good. Sometimes that's just what you want."}
{"text":"A Solon Institution. As you open the door, you enter a time warp, taken back to the 1950's.  Best breakfast in town, with your order shouted to the chef right from your table.  Where the real business of Solon happens over coffee and eggs..."}
{"text":"I am giving this little place 5 stars for these reasons. First off, it is a cute, old fashion, 50's style, very small diner.  The food is great and it is very inexpensive.  If you're looking for clean though, look elsewhere. It's a little on the crusty side.  But the food is great, the service was fast and everyone was very friendly. We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Family owned diner. Good food made to order. Friendly staff. Never had a bad meal here. Breakfast or lunch. Rich will cook it up great. Herb Nelson to burgers to fish dinners. Just know your going to wait if you think your going on a Saturday or Sunday for bfast. Wait your turn!"}
{"text":"Awesome diner. This is where you go when you want quintessential diner fair. Sitting at the counter is the way to go.   Quick service, watching the line at work, and getting the authentic diner experience with the taste and quality you would expect.   The gravy is delicious and the eggs and potatoes were cooked perfectly. We left full and happy and will return."}
{"text":"Love Jim's !! Good food and friendly atmosphere! You'll see all your friends and neighbors there too! Highly recommend! It is a BLAST  from the past!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Besides being a dirty little greasy spoon, and having a rude staff, after waiting 20 minutes to sit in a booth, I was asked to move to the counter or leave because I was alone and they had a party of 2 waiting...this came from the manager."}
{"text":"This was not as pleasant an experience as usual. We had a different waitress her name was Kayla and she was not friendly nor did she bother to check on our drinks. She bused the table while we were finishing up and made us feel very rushed. All in all I do not want her as a waitress again."}
{"text":"If you want a real diner experience you shouldn't go anywhere else. Jim's has been around for 3 generations and will most likely go to the 4th generation. The reason it has lasted so long... good food, friendly staff, great prices. So if you are in northeast Ohio, take a drive and experience one of the last true family run places where quality and great food rule."}
{"text":"So glad we tried this place. Family of four, tried a little of everything. I had the ultimate Herb Nelson and it was very good. I recommend sitting at the counter down by where they are cooking (open kitchen). The whole place ran like a well oiled machine. It's small and they make they most of every inch. Give em a try"}
{"text":"Cash only, nothing special. I ordered the eggs, (scrambled with cheese) sausage links, homefries, and (2)pancakes. 7.95 carryout  I'd never eat hear again. There's somthing about restaurant eggs that i just cant dupilcate at home, but at Jims, my at-home scrambled eggs are definantly better. Jims open kitchen set the cheese ontop my eggs, a square sheet was evident. The sausage was similar to the jimmy dean that i purchase at walmart, nothing special. The homefries where very mushy with just a potato taste..no onion flavor or nothing ... My pancakes were burnt, i tried to eat around the burnt, but that smell and taste couldnt let me do it..both sides just chared. From the square cheese and burnt pancakes, its clear to me that this place does not take pride in the food that they put out. I will never go back nor suggest this place to a friend."}
{"text":"A great little family-owned diner. It's been owned by the same family for the past three generations -- for 49 years now. If you don't mind sitting at the counter you can get a spot in only a few minutes on a crowded Sunday morning. The \"Open Kitchen\" part is since the grill is out there in front of you so you can watch the cooking. It's a throwback to the \"old days\" with the waitresses shouting orders to the cooks. We've been going there for years now and it's a great place where they know you!  The food is uniformly good with almost of everything made on-site. Some good choices are the Jimbo which is a big, messy double cheeseburger or anything from the breakfast menu with all of the standard choices like the usual pancakes or corned beef hash to a surprising eggs benedict. All of the deserts, like rice pudding or cakes are also homemade and great. If you go on a weekday lunch, try the daily special since those are also great and even cheaper."}
{"text":"Excellent everything. YUMMMMM! Nice atmosphere good people great food."}
{"text":"I grew up in solon.. my mom took me here as a little kid like once a week.. Im talkin 20 friggin years ago.  Im glad jims is still open and crackin"}
{"text":"Classic breakfast/lunch kitchen. The reviews don't like. Great place for good American fare. Very friendly staff. Fast service. I had the Big Rich platter. Double bacon cheeseburger with fries. I really love their fresh cole slaw. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Solid, reliable, and down-to-earth. Best breakfast joint in Solon."}
{"text":"The original Jim's in Solon. What a place.  Located conveniently right off SR 422 at 43 and 91, this the kind of place you'd remember your mom or dad taking you to as a kid. Totally dated, small interior with a Cleveland friendly atmosphere. No pretense here, just honest, from scratch grill top cooking for breakfast, lunch, or a casual dinner.  My favorite is breakfast and I usually get 2 eggs over medium, home fries, rye, bacon and a side of sausage gravy. Heaven.   They are still cash only, but they do have an ATM in the front of the inside of the restaurant.  Try Jim's, you'll love it or we can't be friends.   And get the home fries extra crispy!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. We were there early on a Saturday morning and it was packed. Its a good little place with the look and feel of an old school diner with great food priced cheap. I had a breakfast sandwhich and she had one of the specials. After tip and everything we were out of there for about $15. I don't make it out to the solon area often but next time I'm around I'll stop back in to try there lunch menu as well. If you ask anyone from or near Solon they all know about Jim's so it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Another great local establishment for breakfast. Tried the Herb Nelson - I guess it's their signature dish. Enjoyed it; it was good. All menu items very reasonably priced. Although place is a bit small and crowded. Probably not a great place to meet a larger crowd... and they only take cash."}
{"text":"Jim's is an American diner that serves breakfast and lunch at the corner of Aurora Rd. and S.O.M. in Solon. Don't expect the servers to say \"it was my pleasure,\" on cue as they are programmed to in Chick-Fil-A and Time-Warner Cable. Instead, do expect non-scripted, authentic human interactions. Sometimes I miss that.  Jim's an excellent, affordable place to have breakfast. It is equal parts delicious and classic Americana."}
{"text":"Great place for a cheap breakfast. Been going to Jim's for the past 25 years. The service and staff are excellent."}
{"text":"Good food, affordable, and like a good \"old-fashioned\" diner, fattening. Definitely a local fave.  Haven't had anything besides breakfast here - the basic 2 eggs, toast, bacon & hash browns, all delish. The joint used to be open only for breakfast and lunch, but at some time in the recent past they began serving dinner and expanded their hours to 8pm.  As some others have said, space is at a premium here...counter seating and maybe 5 or 6 booths that can seat 4 comfortably - MAYBE 6 if you have smaller kids or you are willing to squish in. Best to go in off-peak hours (during the week, or if on the weekend, after 12)."}
{"text":"After years of hearing about this place, we went for the first time this morning. I had the \"Ultimate Herb Nelson\" with white toast. Wife had eggs, bacon, home fries and a bagel. Everything was cooked as we asked. Service was extremely friendly. Coffee was excellent. We arrived at 7:30am and were able to find a seat right away. The wife and I are diners. We eat our meal and leave. If your looking for a place to be able to take an hour or two to eat your breakfast, Jim's is not for you. Seating is very limited and you will get the \"stink\" eye from people waiting for tables if they believe you are taking too long. We definitely will become \"regulars\"."}
{"text":"We have lived in the Boro for almost 2 years and have not tried this place.  So far, we've been 2 times in a week and feel like we have missed so much.  Our choice has been breakfast but today at our most recent visit, a burger was coming out of the kitchen at 930 a.m.     The Half Nelson is superb!  Can't wait to try waffles, French toast, sausage gravy biscuits, eggs Benedict, and a burger.  Place is packed and now they take cards!"}
{"text":"Decent homecooking for a decent price. serves breakfast all day and you can watch them cook it! seems like a family business, everyone knows everyone type of place, and you can get seated at lunch rather quickly (not an easy feat in solon at lunchtime!) really small, just a counter and a few tables so not a good place for a big group."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Old-style diner with a row of booths on one side and counter service on the other.   I had French Toast and Sausage and Hubby had an Omelet, Home Fries and Toast. We both felt our meals were delicious! They were very quick and friendly too.  This restaurant definitely deserves all the good reviews it gets. We were visiting from about an hour away but are planning a return trip and will be returning here for some more Breakfast goodness!"}
{"text":"Love the greasy old school diner! Love how it is a mix of all types of people. THe food is incredible, the mood is happy and old-school, the staff is nice. The Herb Nelson is great. A Solon classic."}
{"text":"Great vibe in this funky little 50's/60's style diner. Great place for an inexpensive breakfast or lunch prepared right. Excellent friendly service. If you are in Solon at breakfast time check it out."}
{"text":"I had been trying to get a meal here for about a month with my daughter, but this place is always packed on the weekend after 9am and now I know why.     First off, it is a little cramped in there, but deal with it. It really is part of the charm, something I rarely say.    They only take cash, but there is an ATM in the corner so that is ok.    The service here is friendly and great! My daughter was extremely comfortable with our waitress, which does not happen 90% of the time. Our meals came to us within I think 6 minutes, which surprised me based on how many people were in the restaurant eating (26-30 people).     The food was great and, dare say I, better than my mom's cooking in terms of the home fries. My daughter got a waffle that was bigger than her head and stacked with chocolate chips and she said it was the best she has ever had, but the sample size is limited haha.     Anyways, I would go there any day of the week and I hope someone reading this takes the effort and makes a trip to this gem, because it is well worth it."}
{"text":"A favorite local restaurant.  Definitely not fancy. Limited hours, great food, fast service. Good for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"I used to eat at a counter restaurant a lot like this growing up.  I'm not old enough to remember \"lunch counters,\" in my head they look like this place.  A counter you sit at, limited other seating, open kitchen.  Came here after a night on the town, looking for breakfast.  I got an omelet, which was over-browned, which I didn't like.  However, home fries were great.  And I got a post-breakfast milkshake (this is not a habit of mine), which was excellent."}
{"text":"The best place for an old fashion diner experience with an amazing friendly wait staff and a great array of home style cooked food."}
{"text":"I am giving it three stars based on my friends experience, because my carry out food was not worth going back for, but he eats there often and he recommended the place. Next time I will try to eat in."}
{"text":"Super cool 50's style diner. The way it should be. People know each other, decent music, great food generous proportions. I'd eat here till I tried just about everything on the menu. Had some kind of breakfast mash. Really good!"}
{"text":"Jim's Open Kitchen is an old fashioned diner and a favorite among the locals.   The place is small and always seems packed, especially for breakfast. Seating consists of booths or at the counter on swivel type stools. The counter seating runs the length of the restaurant and overlooks the open kitchen and flat top grill where the breakfast is prepared right in front of you. For the whole experience, you must sit at the counter.   The menu consists of typical diner breakfast and lunch fare and everything is made to order. Prices seem fair and service is always top notch.   If you're looking for a cozy diner with food prepared by people who actually love what they do all the while patronizing a family owned business, then this is the place for you. The folks at Jim's put a lot of love into their place and it certainly reflects on the business they generate."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast but be ready to wait. You have to figure out the slower times to go but it's worth it! Omelettes, pancakes, home fries - sit down and enjoy! Streetsboro location is a bit bigger and just as tasty. Nice staff, fast delivery, good prices. Perfect diner!"}
{"text":"Here right now with my kids and my sons' friend. First we all love Jims So that's one plus   Nice staff good solid food!"}
{"text":"Great little diner. The food taste good and the price is right. Always a good choice if I want get something quick."}
{"text":"if a throwback diner is what you are looking for this is the place.  I have breakfast here 3 to 4 times a week.  Food is great, staff is fantastic and they play great music. If you are looking for a fun, friendly atmosphere where they know your name and really ask how you are doing Jims is the place for you."}
{"text":"Perfect diner. Period.   I have never had a bad meal here.  The Jimbo burger is delicious and the french fries are superb, but I always order the Big Rich Platter (double cheeseburger with caramelized onion, lettuce, pickle, and Thousand Island dressing served with fries, coleslaw, and a drink) or the Little Ricky...a smaller version of the the Big Rich Platter.    For breakfast, I always get the Herb Nelson...delicious!  While my husband takes it as is, I like to add mushrooms with sausage links on the side.   Jim's always makes their home fries (hashbrowns) from scratch...the best and only way in my opinion :)   My husband has been going here for years (since before high school) and we go to this place every time we visit his family....more than once.  The diner is small, so you may have to wait a bit for a table but it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"A true classic 60s diner. Take a step back in time and enjoy a true classic open kitchen diner. We stopped in for a quick breakfast bite. The ultimate Herb was a great choice. The potatoes were crisp and the bacon was a perfect addition. The pancakes were nothing outstanding, but still a solid pancake around the Twinsburg area. My wife had the corned beef hash... Out of the can taste. A little disappointing for such a retro establishment. The biscuits and gravy was good with large chunks of sausage. **Please note, Jim's is CASH only** Overall a good breakfast, but was just hoping for a little more after stepping through the door."}
{"text":"Lunch with coworkers last week, and we adventured here in Solon.  It is your classic old school diner - right down to the fact that is a CASH ONLY establishment.  Staff: 5 stars - friendly, down to earth, knew many of the diners   Ambiance: 5 stars for look and feel (vintage posters, jute boxes at booth, classic diner feel), 1 star for comfort (sat in a booth and there was absolutely no padding left - just coils, bumps and discomfort)  Food: 2 stars  - high levels of butter and grease everywhere.  I ordered the Hash Nelson, which sounded like a tasty veggie-potato-egg medley, but was nearly all potato and had unexpected hair found in it.  My coworkers ordered a sandwich (he said it was super tasty but greasy) and a salad (overall dull).  Price: 5 stars - super inexpensive!  See: cash only:)"}
{"text":"Went to Jim's Open Kitchen. Very much a small diner experience and exactly what we were looking for. Maybe has 5 or 6 tables total and a bar with about 20 stools. Seat yourself. The service was very quick and the food was delicious, good prices for the area. Lots of people working, and the cooking was behind the bar so you can watch them make your food if you sit there. We will definitely make this our regular spot for breakfast. We tried eggs(scrambled and over easy)bacon sausage patties French toast and pancakes between the four of us dining, everything was good. My 6 year old wants to go there every morning, we settled for once a month!"}
{"text":"Always good! If you're from Solon, you know Jim's has the best breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast, featuring your typical diner fare.  Space is, how you say, scarce, and there's all kinds of regulars clogging up the counter and booths.    If you're in the mood for a greasy spoon breakfast, and not averse to waiting for a bit, then come to Jim's and see why they have so many freakin' regulars."}
{"text":"Exactly what you would expect from a small, cash only, old-school diner. Very crowded on a Sunday morning, which surprised me. While it took a little time to get a booth, there was counter seating available for couples. The wait to sit was more than made up for in prompt service and quick delivery of our plated breakfasts. The cost-to-food ratio is definitely in the customers favors. My wife and I each got a breakfast sandwich with homefries, and split an order of sausage gravy and biscuits. My daughter got the pancakes kids meal, and we substituted a scrambled egg for the meat at no charge. Food came out hot and fast. And delicious. Will go back. $23 for 3 is a steal."}
{"text":"My first time there Saturday! Great breakfast and can't wait to go back. Eggs perfect, hash browns crispy how I ordered them, bacon just right, toasted bagel & good coffee. Waitress was efficient and friendly. Watched the breakfast being made on the grill right in front of me. Didn't have to wait for someone to take it out from under a heating lamp."}
{"text":"Da bomb. A classic in Solon with an easy going staff and impressive portions. I make sure to come here at least once when I'm home for the holiday. Bring your friends here!"}
{"text":"I've been to Jim's many times for breakfast and its always very consistent and the staff are friendly. I like to show up once or twice a month around 6 am when they open and the staff is so friendly and nice , the food is great and service is fast.   What else can I say just a all around Great place for breakfast and sure for lunch all so. The food is the home type of eggs,  home-fries, sausage, bacon, etc ..   Just a Perfect place even for a cup of great coffee and warm good morning..A terrific place!"}
{"text":"The reviews looked interesting, so I thought I'd try it for lunch.  Was a little hard to find - I drove by twice before I spotted it sitting right there on the street.  Sat at the counter and had fun watching all the people coming a going.  Quite the busy place, with a lot of regulars.  A lady sat next to me and kept apologizing for having to ask me for salt and pepper etc.,..  I think I had her usual spot right in front of all the condiments on the counter :-).  So it made lunch that more fun teasing her every time she needed something.  Had the Herb Nelson with a chocolate shake.  The plate didn't look that good when I got, but tasted great.  And the shake was even better.  Definitely didn't leave hungry."}
{"text":"This is a great place for breakfast or lunch. I love places like this. The Place to Be in Lakewood is also one of my favorite breakfast/lunch diners. My friend asked me to meet up for lunch here today and I obliged. The service was excellent and the people were genuine. The location in Solon kind of blew my mind because this place strikes me more of a nice, blue collar crowd. There weren't too many corporate types that can sometimes ruin a lunch with all that bullshit talk about work."}
{"text":"Two weekend breakfast visits. Same perspective: It's a diner. Pretty well kept. Small. Typical menu.  It's popular. Why?  I presume that it's because Solon is a soul crushingly sterile place to live, and Jim's at least has some color.  Expect to wait weekend mornings (when we went).  Average food. Ok by me, it's a diner. Reasonably priced.  The service? Grumpy. Tattoo's galore. Did I mention Real grumpy?  \"I don't wanna be here so I'm not gonna make a single effort to welcome you, introduce myself, smile or anything.  Here's your food. Eat it. Get out. Cash only (the ATM takes up half the waiting space).\" Average food and grumpy service?  Count me out.  Great food and ALWAYS happy to see me?  That's Yours Truly, and that's where you can find me."}
{"text":"Great/standard breakfast food, fast and reliable service, good price!  Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Old diner style feel!  Checkers countertops. Super friendly staff and its cooked right there.  Greasy and amazing.  Perfect for breakfast.   Toast is overly buttered but its oh so good.  Potatoes are browned to perfection and amazing with or without ketchup.  Fast and friendly! Awesome!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite little restaurants of all time. Solon has definitely changed since I was a kid. Not for the bad though, just more developed, more upscale shops, and much of the local charm has dwindled. However, Jim's keeps the charm alive. The owners and employees are very nice, and get to know their customers well. Complimentary cups of joe through out you're breakfast meal there are a regular thing. Classic sit in diner that hasn't changed since FDR's administration lol. Little table juke-boxes still work from what I remember. Every time I am back home, I grab some eggs and coffee here. After I stop in, I know I am truly home again, and no matter where you are from, you will feel the same way when you come in as well. Enjoy this little jem of Solon, OH."}
{"text":"My Grandpa has been going to Jims for almost 30 years. I've been going for more than 15. They are so nice to him and my family, and the breakfast can't be beat. If you're a local or want to know where the locals go--this is it!  If you go on the right day, Jim will actually be cooking!  And just a tip: If it's your first time and there is a line, don't dawdle at the booths!"}
