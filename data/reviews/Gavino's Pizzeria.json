{"text":"Specialty pies are amazing! Chicken bacon ranch is the best pie in the Rox. Always fast delivery and friendly staff. Salads are excellent along with the homemade ranch. Excellent wings! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First off let me state that my wife loves the Mediterranean subs here. I went for the Gyros platter. You know you are in trouble when a place cannot properly pronounce the food they are selling! It's Gyros \" Year ros\" or Yeros . I know Pittsburgh thinks it's the way it's said but it only makes people from outside of Pittsburgh think you are a ignorant jagoff. (See? I included Pittsburghese)
 Let's just say it's a good thing I was hungry . It was mildly average. I will break it down.  The pita was actually the best part nice and soft. The lettuce was good. And the purple onions were crisp and tasty. But the sauce was a poor imitation of the standard sauce. As very little was in it making it more like sour cream . It would had been better also if there was more of it offered. Now the meat of the review. Since this is more of a pizza place it was your average put together out of a kit Gyros meat with a little flavor and just a bit over cooked.  
I have been here many times before because of the location being close to my house, and I'm sure I'll be here again I just will remember to stick to the subs."}
{"text":"This review was for delivery service.

Not impressed for the following reasons:
-There was a language barrier when placing my order.  Several words and items had to be repeated multiple times for verification. Please have a native English speaker man your phone.
-Delivery time was about 20 minutes longer than told.  When called to check on my order, the employee was harsh and abrupt. Have someone friendly man your phones.
-Food was very mediocre.  Really lacking. My items were more dough than substance / flavor.

The only reason I gave 2 vs 1 star is because the prices were lower than any other delivery place to my Neville Island hotel."}
{"text":"both times i've tried this place, ordered one pizza and it took two hours to come. i live up the street there's no excuse. i could pick up, but that's not what i am paying you extra for. will try doughboy's."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE pizza place in the roxs! 

Their speciality pizzas are delicious and wings always on point. 

Very friendly staff!

Delivery is always fast and the food is always hot."}
{"text":"Meh. The pizza was pretty flavorless, and the delivery took 30 minutes longer than stated. The pizza was reminiscent of gas station pizza. I was excited about trying somewhere new for pizza, but I doubt we'll be going back."}
{"text":"On the way back from checking out a house for sale, the smells wafting in from the pizzerias were overwhelming. We made a U-turn and parked on the street across from this spot. The Mediterranean pasta was good, just like the service. Not life changing, but still good. My friend really fancied the mild wings. We enjoyed some Doctor Oz ironically playing on their flat screen. My dish was big (it turned into 2-3 meals for me) and I was served a nice piece of garlic bread, sliced. They have a good selection of drinks, among the normal ever so mundane pop, Arizona tea, and gatorade.  The reason for 3 stars is because the meal was just okay, but what you would expect from a pizzeria. There weren't any napkins around and my friend (who was munching on saucy wings) had to ask for some mid-meal."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent! The delivery man (named Jay) was friendly and fast! I gave him a nice tip for being so great"}
