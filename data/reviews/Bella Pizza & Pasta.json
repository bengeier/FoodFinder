{"text":"So I heard this place gave out a free rose and a free desert to any mother who ate there on Mother's Day, how awesome is that ! ! !   But I absolutely love the food here at Bella, just had a slice of mushroom today, apparently you can get a slice of whatever the heck you want any time of day, but my all time favorite is the Bella Delight... Fried eggplant covered with ricotta cheese, Italian sausage, homemade marinara and mozzarella... And then they bake it. No wonder I eat here all the time."}
{"text":"A real New York style pizza place not only in food but attitude in East Mesa!! Not the nasty New Yorker attitude but that \"hey let's have some fun attitude!\" The food is great! Everything's made fresh. The staff is fun and awesome, they really make you feel like home. Its a family restaurant, with great prices and great specials. It's definitely a place to go check out to eat."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I sent my brother into the store to grab a to-go pizza, while I finished a phone call in the car. Not only was he ignored for 5 minutes, but the supposed 7 minute wait turned into a 20 minute wait. I even asked for a refund due to lack of time, but the lady told me my pizza was ready. Then, she made me wait another three minutes. This was not polite. It is lunchtime, and I was on a time-crunch. They did not offer us water, but every other person that walked in the door was offered a beverage. I had to walk to the back to get their attention, because the two ladies were talking in the kitchen. I will advise everyone I know to NEVER visit this place. Bad service is unacceptable, and I will take my business to someone that appreciates me."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, I must say, this is the best NY style pizza I've had since moving out here.  I have look for NY pizza here in AZ for years so gratefully one of my friends took me to Bellas. Its now the only place I go with my family to have good Italian food.  BTW their wings are great. Yes Even better then the other NY Style pizza across the street."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome service. Everything on the menu is very good and taste great!  Employees are friendly and make sure you are taken care of.   I've brought many family, friends and co-workers here and they all have loved it and continue to come back."}
{"text":"Can't say enough kind things about the staff here. They are very accommodating and make the experience so that you want to come back. Not to mention the food is excellent. It's refreshing to find a restaurant that values service as much as the food, highly recommend dining at this establishment!"}
{"text":"Amazing first experience at Bella! Very friendly staff, and stellar service, and INCREDIBLE food! Definite NY taste to the pizza, huge slices. Was helped by Joyce and Debra who were both an absolute delight. Looking forward to a return visit for lunch very soon!"}
{"text":"Big fan of the Pizza.  16\" 2 topping and 12\" cheese feeds the family with some left overs for lunch.  Pasta and salads were OK - I go back for the thin crust pizza and the cheese.  Very nice family owned restaurant - service can be a bit slow but the food and atmosphere is worth it."}
{"text":"This is a true Italian pizzeria.  The restaurant is small, but the staff can rotate through patrons quickly.  Don't be intimidated by the small setting or if you have to wait for a table to open up.  The wait staff is VERY friendly and accommodating.  The pizza is absolutely one of the tastiest I have had anywhere.  This is New York style pizza, a little thinner crust, but a nice thick edge to grab ahold of.  The sauce is wonderful and the toppings are plentiful.  My wife and I heard many good referrals for the pizza so we had to start with that on our first visit.  We will definitely go back to try some of the other Italian dishes."}
{"text":"Neighborhood mom and pop joint.  Well worth the visit.  Only giving 4 stars because have not tried every type of food on menu.  Mozzarella sticks are always on our order have yet to try the fried zucchini.  The marinara is excellent.  Food is homemade. Nice atmosphere small, intimate setting.  Service is excellent.  Small sports tv on in dining area."}
{"text":"I am really glad we have this place so close.  I know upon entering it's not much but their food speaks louder...in a good sense. Well, i havent had the pasta but I really like their pizza. but what I mostly love ,and I'm quite picky about, are their WINGS!  They are big and they are cooked right!  I'm never disappointed with them and are priced fair.  Good soda so far, bonus!  But it's stuffy and kind of an eye sore inside. ..best to do take out.  Haven't had a complaint about the staff yet. Nice ppl.  I like it and plan to come here again and again."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Bella Pizza and Pasta.  Pizza, wings, garlic bread, and garlic knots are amazing.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Close to home, pretty good tasting food, excellent customer service, and fast food overall. One minor downside for me is I didn't find their chairs to be that comfortable but that's not that bad. They were actually pretty dang expensive, around $10-12 per meal, which was way more than I thought it would be when I walked in the front door.  When you walk in there, you'd think their main price point would be around $6-8 but you'd be mistaken. Not a bad place at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this spot. Service is awesome & hilarious. I love the Sausage, Pepper & Onion hero. Can't go wrong in this spot, everything is good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a slice a while back. Loved it!  Ordered carry out a few weeks later, also great. Stopped in tonight to pick up carry out and was very disappointed. The person that answered my call for the order was completely incompetent. He repeated my order 3 times and when I showed up to pick it up, it was totally wrong. I recognized the guy's voice from the phone order. He blamed it on someone else and told me that he was sorry and they would re-make the order. I get home and they did NOT remake it, only a poor attempt to \"fix\" my food. Two stars for take out is very generous. Staff stinks and food is good. Proceed with caution..."}
{"text":"We love this homemade italian food!!  Me & the hubby usually order the Bellas Pasta Trio or something like that.  You choose THREE dishes of your choice.  We usually order two orders of lasagne and spaghetti & meatballs!  Delicious!!!!  The garlic knots are incredibly good.   I love coming here!  Out waitress is usually the tiny little bouncy one and she is always pleasant!  So glad we found this off the wall place since we moved here.  They had great scores (I think) on TripAdvisor and that is how we located them!!!  Thanks for the great food and service every time!!"}
{"text":"I think Bella may have the best pizza in the east valley. I am not kidding... See for yourselves order a pie well done.. I Definitely will repeat"}
{"text":"I absolutely love to eat at this place. Love it all, no matter what I order. Fish and chips, pizza, subs, with one of my favorites being the spaghetti. Salads and homemade dressings are fantastic as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pizza isn't terrible. Don't get the Chicken Marsala. Super bummed I ordered take out and dropped $15 on that and it had zero sauce and the chicken was as flat as a dead cat on the US60. Dang it."}
{"text":"Had my first Bella experience today and it was pretty laughable. The place is not visually appealing, inviting, or very comfortable. I doubt it's been changed for 20 years. Had the Alfredo and side salad. It was not good. Will I get ill or was it awful? No. Do I have any reason to return? No."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time. Great pizza, awesome service. They make you feel at home and are so friendly! I have found my new pizza place!"}
{"text":"Solid pasta, great pizza.  Great little place.  It is not gourmet, but it is better than the chain pizzas and it is good simple pastas and sauces.  I forget to go here, but when I do stop by I am never dissapointed.  Nice employees too."}
{"text":"Wife and I just had lunch there.  Wow. Great, family-ran restaurant. Had the spaghetti and garlic bread special.  Delicious. All homemade, including the top-notch salad dressing. Great,  friendly service and a reasonable price.  I highly recommend,  and I am quite picky!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Glad we found it, thanks for putting out flyers in the area. We will definitely be ordering more from here."}
{"text":"Bella's is the best Italian food I've ever had. The people there are extremely friendly. The food tastes like it is strait out of Italy and their fried zucchini is to die for!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch have been back food was delis now my new place to go when I feel like Italian."}
{"text":"We don't eat out often due to our families food allergies especially my husbands allergy to tomatoes, but there is something for everyone on the menu. We had the pleasure of meeting the owner and he was so friendly and accommodating. The food was as good as it was before on our previous visit. What really made the visit worth the five stars though was the time he spent just talking to our family. It felt like eating with family. This is our new go to place. Thanks for the great experience and great food."}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm in love with their food. So good, sooo Italian! I love it. I moved here from New York and it just does not get any better. I visit Bella's weekly....i LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Great pizza small town feeling and family oriented and friendly. Excellent quality and good portions!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza and garlic Knott's i have ever had!!! The service is amazing and the manager Kevin was friendly and looked in on us to make sure everything was great!"}
{"text":"Always delicious and it's our families go to for pizza and pasta!  We've never had a bad meal & it's one of the few places that we frequent regularly!"}
{"text":"Friendly prompt service. Small but very nice. Very good toasted Italian bread!! Spaghetti and meatballs was great!! Wife had the Italian Hero which she says is better than Firehouse! Wwwwhhaaatttt??? Canolis give Casanova brothers a good run for the money.    Will try the pizza!!!# Great service Brandon"}
{"text":"Wow!  So many mixed reviews on the quality of the food. This review however, is for the awesome NY Style pizza slice only!  While driving home from work yesterday I had a craving for a nice, large slice of NY Style pizza.  Something as big as my hand and less than $5 a slice.  I took my phone out and quickly Yelp'd \"Pizza by the Slice\" and found this gem.  When I pulled up I could smell freshly made sauce, basil and bread, before I opened the door.  There was an older lady coming out of the restaurant with a huge carry out bag.  Huge!  That was a good sign.    Inside, there was a single man dining, eating the eggplant special and a party of 4 other women dining as well.  I noticed they had a bottle of wine so I assumed it's a BYOB place because I didn't see wine anywhere.  I ordered one slice of pepperoni pizza and decided to eat inside.  My total was $3.42.  It took less than 5 minutes to arrive and it was everything I was hoping it would be.  Crispy bottom, greasy, tasty cheese and pepperoni.  I asked for red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese.  I was delighted when the server and to go behind the counter and get it out of the refrigerator.  I love that they don't keep the parm on the tables that stuff is supposed to be refrigerated. I'd definitely rerun again for the NY Slice of pizza.  Despite the many mixed reviews (more like negative reviews) on the other food items, I still want to try them for a full course dinner."}
{"text":"Had the lasagna with a side salad and bread. The portion size was huge but the food itself was mediocre. It just wasn't spectacular in any way but at least it wasn't gross. I don't know about the service because my order was to go. Considering this place is across the street from a Venezia's I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"While trying to figure out where to eat with a group of friends we decided to try a new pizza joint, and boy our group was so happy to find this place. Portions were fantastic Branden our server was entertaining and yeah the food rocked."}
{"text":"If you are a true New Yorker and really want to have good pizza in Arizona this place is where it is at.  Thin crust pizza that makes your mouth water and taste buds go crazy this is the place.  Their lunch special (all you can eat for 6.95 pizza, pasta, and garlic knots) is amazing and their pies are pretty well priced too!  This is a family owned joint which I love and support with all my heart.  The owners are from NY and despite the NY reputation for harsh words and being brash they are some of the friendliest restaurateurs in the area.  I will continue to go here for amazing pizza until I move a significant way away.  This place is worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give Bella another star, I really did.  The pizza is decent,  the garlic knots garlicky and the fried ravioli crispy.   The customer service?  Rotten.  I called last night at 8:10pm for delivery.   According to the website they're open until 9.  When the woman answered she informed me they closed at 8, and had been closing at 8 for months. When I asked why the website said open until 9 she replied in an intensely snarky voice that she didn't know and ended the call.  Sorry Bella, the food isn't good enough to deal with rude workers and misinformation, I'll find another pizza joint."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great customer service. The meatball sandwich is out of this world delicious. Prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"I've been to Bella's Pizza and Pasta a few times and I've also ordered out a few times.  We were just there this past friday night and wow they have totally dropped the ball. It took over an hour to receive our food. Our food was coming out all different times so half of our group was done eating While others were still waiting on your food to come out and the sampler platter had all been over deep fried. The pizza is decent, the pasta was better a few months ago, the wings are good but Stromboli is the only reason I return. The cheese cheesesteaks are worthless and they nickel and dime you for everything. If you're looking for a good meat stromboli you should try this place."}
{"text":"I'm from New Jersey and finding east coast pizza can be a real chore.... then I found Bella's Pizza & Pasta not far from my house.  I started out stopping there for the lunch specials and now almost every Friday I order pizza delivered for the weekend munchies.   The pizza is delicious and we ask for it to be well done and it's always done just right.  You can't go wrong with Bella's.  Try them.. you'll like them!"}
{"text":"I work right near here, thought I'd try them out for lunch.  Ordered a gyro w/a side salad and iced tea.  Tea was ehhh, but I'm pretty picky about my tea.  Gyro was yummy and salad was decent, nothing special.  I thought it was a little overpriced, but  still good food.    Tough location they chose here, with another well-known delicious place just across the intersection.  But I will probably try this place again, check out their hot subs next time."}
{"text":"Just happened to be in the neighborhood and saw this place. Popped in and evidently there's an underground society of New Yorkers in Arizona that already know about this place. And of course that's a telltale sign of a good pizza place. I ordered the garlic knots with cheese and they were on the table in a matter of minutes. I ate 6 of them in under 5 minutes if that tells you anything. Before I was done there was a slice of New York style pizza. Huge and the price was right. It appears to be family owned with lots of regulars. Literally nothing to complain about even if I wanted to."}
{"text":"Steve is the man!  Great pizza, subs & service!  Stop & eat here at least once per week coming out of Queen Creek after work!! The only down side is all the ugly New York Yankee memorabilia!!   Hahaha, GO REDSOX!"}
{"text":"Natalie was amazing her customer service is far superior than a majority of people in the industry will be coming back again the pizza taste very good and thorough garlic knots are highly recommended"}
{"text":"I ordered take out (a total of 3 items) and they forgot my garlic knots! The pizza was thin crust, but very greasy. Also the staff was not friendly; no greeting upon arrival. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"OHHH MYYY GAWD!! This is BY FAR the BEST pizza joint I've been to in the ENTIRE Phoenix/Mesa area!! Traditional NY style pizza and baked, yes I said BAKED wings!! (Ask Matt) I travel the US for my job and this place is #1!! We also ordered the Garlic cheesy bread!! WOW!! A MUST try!! Garlic Knots were amazing!! My partner ordered the chicken parm sandwich 12\" DELICIOUS!! Steven (the owner) came over to see how everything was AND our waitress (Natalie) was extremely attentive and polite! This FAMILY owned business is a DEFINITE stop off on yr way to the renaissance festival or the large swap meet (or any east Mesa pass by) we will be back!!"}
{"text":"amazing service. we asked if they had any vegan options and the whole staff was helpful with recommendations and very accommodating. next time i'm in mesa i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"New to the area and decided to try this local pizza place. Based on the reviews, I expected phenomenal. I was really hoping for great at the very least. We ordered a ham & pineapple, a pick 5 toppings, & a Caesar salad to be delivered. We were told an hour which was fine. Salad wasn't with order, one of the toppings was missing from my pizza and honestly, the other 4 were skimpy at best (see photo-slice on left has half a slice of mushroom and neither have Italian sausage as ordered). Thought the flavor was okay. Husband thought it was good but not great. We both agreed it wasn't worth the cost. I'm bummed because there were other menu items that sounded awesome but in truth, I won't be back. Note- Post review- I commend them for refunding the salad cost and even providing a credit. They did the right thing but still not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from this restaurant for over the last year regularly and they are FANTASTIC!!! I have ordered their meat eaters pizza, veggie lovers, their pasta manicotti with Alfredo, salads, and a bunch of their different sides over this time and everything that we've received has been absolutely incredible. They're quick to deliver and the owner is one of the nicest people I've had the pleasure of doing business with. They use supreme ingredients with great recipes. I highly recommend them for everybody, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Let me say first that I hate to give negative reviews. I've eaten at Bellas several times over the last couple years and have always enjoyed both the quality and quantity of food, however, the last few pizzas that I ordered - gluten free - had hardly any toppings on them. In fact, The toppings on the gluten-free pizza were so minimal that I had to go to the refrigerator and add my own toppings. I don't expect tons of pepperoni, but the pizza I got only had one or two small bites each piece.  Since then, I haven't been back!"}
{"text":"Best NY pizza in Arizona! I don't normally care much for red sauce, but I devour the red sauce here! You can't go wrong ordering anything on the menu! The lunch specials are extremely inexpensive, and you can get a giant NY slice any time of day for under $3! Love this place! Joyce is a fabulous server!"}
{"text":"Where the pizza is good, everything else lacks! Pizza was decent. That's about it. We got a chicken and bacon pizza that was pretty good, the crust was a little on the soggy side but thin crust is tricky like that. The gyro was disgusting! The meat was very dry and just stacked on top of the pita like it came right out of the frozen package. This might be me being picky but I've never had a gyro with slices of what appears to be meat, its always shredded or thinly sliced. When it got to my house it looked like somebody threw a pile of cold fries on the bottom, then a pita and a slab of grainy brown meat. The fries are an upcharge which makes this place overpriced. We will probably try the pizza again but won't go out of our way to get it. I would give 2 stars, but the lady who took our order was nice so they have that going for them."}
{"text":"best food period! Homemade, great atmosphere great service!! Slices HUGE, N.Y. style."}
{"text":"My wife and I have just returned from Bella's and I must say that we both agree that we have had much better pizza. First of all they didn't give us what we ordered on the pizza (onion instead of green pepper) and it was also lacking sauce and cheese. The crust WAS very crisp but the burger tasted like it was made yesterday.  This is too bad because we were impressed by the other menu items and really wanted to like this mom and pop Italian spot. Next time, back to Mod's Pizza we go!"}
{"text":"They have delicious pizza and garlic knots... But I would recommend staying away from the fettuccini Alfredo. It wasn't gross or anything it just didn't have any flavor..and definitely not worth $11 even if it does come with garlic bread."}
{"text":"I thought I would try a new pizza place, the phone line to order was busy and their online ordering was not working (not a good sign) so I called a few more times and finally got through only to be put on hold. When they finally started to take my order they got my phone number and address and then click the line is dead. No calling me back...WTF!! Guess I won't ever know if their food is good or not!!"}
{"text":"Me and my family were referred to this place for good Italian eating.... Well they were RIGHT!!! Great food and friendly staff will continue to keep coming to this establishment and would recommend it to anybody I meet"}
{"text":"This is the best pasta and sandwich place to stop by in east mesa. Trust me you will never be disappointed with the service and really freshness of their meals. Pizza is good. I am not exaggerating as the best pizza in the nation but defensively one of the good ones around town. Prices are super reasonable and quantity goes well with quality. The place is very convenient. Super casual and lots of parking space."}
{"text":"Just had to add... we recently tried their mozzerella sticks and they were also amazing, and we later found out they are hand made on site.  Still love this place, and glad to be supporting local business!"}
{"text":"All in all a good experience.  The outside strip mall look doesn't do the place justice, because once you walk in you get a much cozier feel.  The service was very personal and polite.  He actually took real interest in our dining experience.  That's something you don't get much of these days.  Thank you for the terrific service!  The food.  We ordered a pizza and a pasta.  The pizza was surprisingly good tasting.  It had a terrific herb flavor and was ever so tastey.  The pasta was surprisingly good too.  I was half expecting a super heavy, get sick half way through, pasta.  It was quite the opposite.  I ate the entire thing and enjoyed every bit of it.  It wasn't too heavy, nor too salty, which often results in a to-go box that sits in the refrigerator for a few days before being thrown away.  My one and only complaint would be the price.  The pasta set me back a few dollars more than I would have normall expected, having to pay an additional $2 to add chicken, bringing the price to about $12 for the plate.  Service 5/5! Pizza 4/5 Pasta 4/5 Price 3/5"}
{"text":"Yup, 5-stars. Food was on-point. We will be back for pizza, we got Bella Calzone and Bella pasta entree. Bonus: this place was rated an \"A\" in its recent food inspection, many users don't check food inspections (just reviews). If you want a mid-west vibe, a New York style place, then go here! Bring your own bottle and relax (BYOB = $5.00)."}
{"text":"This guy (Steve) has the absolute best crust I have tasted in Arizona, the sauce is great as well. The pizza is exact to NY. They have Coca Cola products and everyone knows Coke and Pizza go together like peanut butter and jelly. The Antipasto salad is pretty good as well. They make party hero's and even sell italian holiday cookies (seasonally). They kept the name when buying this place years ago but dont' be fooled this NEW Bella is WAY better than the old one. The pizza always comes out piping hot and the crust is so crispy and delicious. It is a smallish place and family owned and operated, what more can you ask for?? 5 stars on the pizza and 4.5 on everything else, while you are at it try the garlic knots or zeppoles,WOW!"}
{"text":"I grew up in NJ in the suburbs of NYC. The Italian-American food at Bella's is very good. It reminds me of the mom-and-pop pizzerias I grew up eating at in NJ. Everyone in the East Valley seems to go bananas for Venezia's. Venezia's is ok. Bella's is better.  The pizza at Bella's is more reasonably priced than Venezia's. Bella's pizza is cooked properly, with some crispiness to the crust. Venezia's pizza is always undercooked. Bella's is a small, family run business. The family is from Brooklyn. They know what they're doing.  My favorite thing to order is the chicken parm sub. It is awesome! The pizza is great. The pasta dishes are great. I've heard that their wings and cheese steaks are really good too, though I haven't tried them yet.  Bella's is a small, mom-and-pop, authentic NYC-style pizzeria. The food and service are top notch. And the ambiance is quite nice. Its better than Venezia's or Casanova Brothers. My favorite local pizzeria. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Kind of slow on getting apps and entrees at different times.   Good food , I hope it stays around for a bit to  have a place to go to after work"}
{"text":"The meat lasagna is top notch. The Stromboli and Calzones are works of art. The spaghetti with meat sauce is as good as I make. The service is friendly, helpful and attentive. The prices are very reasonable. All in all this is the small close to home pizza & pasta Italian place we all dream of having just a stones throw away from your front door. Don't let the location or size keep you from trying the food. You will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Wow this place has really improved over the years---and is way better than the place across the street! The Sicilian pizza we ordered was so so good! The crust was thick and chewy, the onions were actually caramelized, and the cheese was gooey and definitely not the cheap stuff. We were really impressed and will order again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"What pathetic service.  I ordered a  16 inch pizza and 6 wings.  I saw a special 30 seconds after I finished paying, that was for a 16 inch and 12 wings for less then what I paid. I was told I couldn't get it because I already paid for my order.  Really?!  The manager refused to void the payment. This was my first and last time here!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here probably about 1-1/2 years ago about 8:35. It was and has been my only visit to here so I can't comment much on their full menu. I decided to order a pepperoni pizza, and a sausage pizza. The owner (a lady) kicked the order back to the kitchen. Within about a minute a man who I believe was her son came out and stated he had already shut the oven off, basically saying I wasnt going to get my pizzas. The owner basically told him well that is too bad, fire it back up and make the pizzas. He grumbled about it, and she said this is my restaurant and I said turn the oven back on and make his pizzas.  It obviously took a lot longer than normal, but I cant really fault her for it. I know it takes money to run an oven and he gambled no one was going to come in. I really liked that she fired the oven back up, and was appreciate that. Most places would have just blown the customer off or saud the oven was having issues... Now I did tell her when I arrived I hadn't been there before, so that might have made a difference.  Onto the pizza. I had the sausage pizza and I thought it was good. I like pizza with a good amount of sauce and they added extra sauce. It wasn't greasy, it had a good consistent flavor. My son and wife ate the pepperoni and they both saud they enjoyed it. I know my son has gone back and ate there several more times so he must like it enough to return multiple times."}
{"text":"Great place for a family meal. Accommodating for people with food allergies. Pizza, subs, salad, and fries are great. Back east pizza experience. Not fancy, just good food and great service.  Pizza is always hot and fresh. People really enjoy working here. Kitchen staff is friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service. Met owners, how can you not they are always around. Pizza is great and mozzarella sticks are hand rolled! Lasagna excellent too. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"First time there.  Food was fantastic.  Staff was awesome.  What to say but, \"I'll be back!\""}
{"text":"I've tried the pizza, pasta and sandwiches. I have dine in, to go and delivery. This place is family owned and the food is tasty with flavor. The service has always been good every time; friendly, polite, knew about the menu items, checked on our table often and always pleasant. I definitely continue to come back here."}
{"text":"Came here after Paintball today. Had the appetizer platter, thin crust all meat pizza and Italian donuts (zeppoli, I think).   So good!  Small, mom and pop with excellent service.  Brandon was the bomb!  5 stars all the way around.  We will be back!  Ok so we just demolished the little donuts covered in honey and powdered sugar.  Oh my!"}
{"text":"We've been here two times, and while it's not much to look at, the food is exceptional. One of the more authentic Italian restaurants in this area. The owners are super friendly and attentive. The complementary garlic bread is actually really yummy! We're happy to support a local small business and will be back!"}
{"text":"Always order for pick up, food is excellent. Just wish they would give you a realistic time for pickup, always have to wait an extra 5 to 10 minutes. Staff are  friendly and courteous. The place is neat and clean"}
{"text":"Truth be told, over the last 5 plus years we have eaten here, I don't think we've ever eaten anything here besides the pizza and garlic knots. Not because the other food doesn't look good, it's that the pizza and garlic knots are so good and filling. This is some of my favorite pizza in the East Valley. The ranch dressing pairs well for dipping the pizza crust. The staff is friendly and easy to do phone orders with. No complaints here, just keep doing what you guys are already doing and we will keep coming back! Tip: Some of the pizzas can get a bit pricey, so make sure you ask about specials. Also, they will sometimes give you coupons with your order for future visits."}
{"text":"Our first time going. We live near by  So we figured on giving it a try. When we walked in, We were welcomed by Joyce. She was very nice.  We were seated right away. We had our drinks when we got to our table. I ordered a small salad which was very good. Then we ordered the garlic knots which were highly recommend by Joyce.  Then we ordered the Create your own Pizza.  It was very good. Very pleasing atmosphere and very nice people. We will be back"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding and service parallels the quality of food. Always friendly and attentive to your needs. This place is always busy but never packed which makes it easy to get in and out. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We just moved to Arizona and found this place doing a Google maps search and thought the pics looked good... Well I can't believe we found or new pizza spot on the first try.  This is really good new York style pizza."}
{"text":"First impression is that I will not be returning. Sad that I live right across the street. I would say for the price there is much better pizza in the area."}
{"text":"Small local pizza spot, friendly staff, clean place. Pizza was very good, i had the Bells White, the wife had pepperoni. Crispy crust, thin pizza. Garlic toast order has lots of pieces included, almost a meal in itself. Price was right. Would def revisit next time in town."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the pizza / salad special, pretty good all around.  We decided to order a meal delivered  a few weeks later , this is when it all went bad .  The pizza was wrong , not just missing something but totally wrong . I called them right away, the driver couldn't of been a 1/4 mile away , any way we got the pizza we ordered 45 minutes later , cold and hard  as a rock and then they insisted that we give back the other pizza that had been sitting on our counter for almost an hour.  One & done here."}
{"text":"Ordered through Slice, they said my order would be $23.82. Called the restaurant to add some garlic bread, they told me my order would be $27 and some change. Driver gets here tells me my total is $24.95ish and there's no extra garlic bread. Spaghetti sauce is thin, watery, and pretty flavorless and the meat balls are just that, balls of meat, little to no seasoning. Meat sauce was pretty good. Lasagna and Chicken Parm were pretty good. They then tried delivering the garlic bread 40 minutes later, and I refused it. Overall, it was ok and we would give them another chance.   Edited to add: Blaming delivery services for poor customer service and a lousy dish doesn't encourage us to return."}
{"text":"Myself and a co-worker found this place while in town on a business trip.  We had an absolutely fantastic lunch of meat lasagna, salad and garlic bread.  The lunch size portions were just right, and at a really good price.  The garlic bread was so good that we got a second order.  We came back for lunch the next day, and ordered some more garlic bread for an appetizer, then tried the pizza.  Again, it was great food with fresh and tasty ingredients.  The service both times was fast and friendly, and I recommend this place if you're looking for some great Italian food!"}
{"text":"I ordered a16\" sausage, onion, mushroom, black olives and fresh garlic.   Crust was light and chewy and the sauce was well balanced.  I was looking forward to eating more after I was done eating.  I also ordered some garlic wings....Super tasty. Great little joint!"}
{"text":"We heard about this place from a friend so my husband and I thought we would check it out.  Brandon was our server and he was very friendly - the service could not have been better, it was perfect!  The food is the real deal - I mean seriously.  Everything and I mean EVERYTHING is made fresh by hand.  I ate enough for 5 people.  I would have taken a photo of what we ordered but it looked and smelled so good by the time I came up for air - it was all gone!    Yum, yum and YUM!"}
{"text":"Bella's never disappoints!  We eat here often and the salad and pizza are our favorites. Nothing fancy about this place, but the food is great, the service friendly and homey, and the prices right. A hidden gem tucked away in east Mesa that is worthy of a visit."}
{"text":"I must have went in on an off day or week but I was not impressed. The place was filthy. My daughters and I stuck to the floor, the furniture, and bathroom floor. The soda machine was so gross I could tell the machine had not been cleaned. Side note : I have worked with soda fountains for years I know a dirty machine. My tea was old and not fresh. The pie was greasy and the toppings slid right off the bread. I will NEVER go back! If I could give less I would. My daughter LOVES pizza, and she wouldn't eat the pizza, that was literally the only time she wouldn't eat pizza. After we ate we paid and went over to eat at Geno's instead."}
{"text":"Decent pizza but this place is a hot mess. No let me take that back, its REALLY good pizza. Especially if you're from the East Coast and like a nice NY style thin crust with some flavor.   Filthy floors and horrible service. Showed up at 1pm, ordered 2 slices of cheese pizza, by 1:30 the pizza ends up coming out. WTF?!?   Why in the worldwould you put your soda fountain on the wrong side of the counter??  Probably would go back if i ordered a pickup but definitely not to eat there."}
{"text":"I am visiting from Ohio.  I looked on Yelp to find somewhere near my mom's for dinner.   I read the reviews and we headed over.   Our waiter, Brandon was super friendly and the food was amazing.   I loved this place.   Can't wait to try the pizza."}
{"text":"Overall not to bad, however I've ordered here a few times now and I must say it's very very decent at best...  Ordered a meatball sub, and received a burned chicken parm...  :/ the plain cheese pizza is good, however the the BBQ chicken is just edible nothing special.  I was venturing away from the place across the way in hopes to find better food,  but looks like my search must continue if you're hungry and must eat you can go here,  if you're looking for great pizza and sandwiches. Keep looking."}
{"text":"Meh.........   2 stars is being generous.  Food is burnt, no flavor and 2 hours for delivery."}
{"text":"We loved Bellas and it is so close to our home.  However, recently, in the past few months we began noticing a deterioration in their pizza and their service.  The pizza dough has been over cooked and tough.  The sauce less flavorful and bland. We ordered 2 dozen wings and when we got home, there were only 21 of the 24 in the boxes.  We always pick up our orders and if they say it will be ready in 30 minutes, expect to wait more like 40-45 minutes.  Bellas prices are a little on the high side, but we didn't mind spending a little more back when the quality was there, but now, we wouldn't spend 1/2 that price on the pizzas they make now.   Sad, now we have to search out a new pizza shop."}
{"text":"To the first reviewer you are obviously not from NY...I am proud to say it's the real deal from the cheese, tomatoe sauce, and ultra thin crust with the black char on the bottom! Way way better than Venezios across the street who's tomato sauce is funky tasting and the crust way to gummy for me. If your from NY and live in the east valley try it once and you'll be back for seconds. How authentic can you get...they even have Zeppolli for dessert. FREAKIN AMAZING!!! If you don't believe me check out the reviews on Urban Spoon too :)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place.  We have eaten out 3 times now and each time it has been great.  The delivery time was accurate and the food was delicious.  It is a little pricier than the normal pizza place, but well worth it in our opinion.  Picked up the pizza one time and it is a cute little restaurant ran by some very nice ladies who treated us very well.  If you are in the area, definitely try this place out.  For now, we have only tried the meatball pizza, but it is delicious."}
