{"text":"Great customer service from Linda. First Affogato and it was great! We tried the strawberry and cheesecake gelato. It's all delizioso!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place!Linda makes the gelato right there in the place and she brings most of her ingredients from Italy! What a great place amazing views and she is so sweet just like her gelato!!!  Ask her for a coffee shakerado for a cool refreshment!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the owner has been rude each one of them. The flavors sound better than they actually taste. They open and close whenever they choose and follow no schedule...this isn't Italy."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best crepe experience in Vegas. Their crispy crepe is served hot with a scoop of their creamy gelato in a flavor of your choice. You can choose a topping of your choice also, but don't do yourself a disservice - just get the Nutella   I think because the crepe is still warm, you can really taste every flavor distinctly. It doesn't feel muddled like with other crepes. Every flavor really comes through very well! The crepe itself is almost the texture of a pancake, not thin and flaky like most other crepes. Super delicious.  The owner is very kind and inviting. My girlfriend and I will be back for more crispy crepes and hope you can expand into the greater Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"Happened to be at the village for a wedding, and had coffee and crepe at this place.. ordered the Nutella and banana crepe and it was really tasty.  The lady who greeted us super nice and made us feel welcomed.  I had the cappuccino and it really tasty.  The view was really nice, we sat outside facing the lake.  Highly recommend this place.  Food was great, and the place feels homey."}
{"text":"Stayed at the Hilton Resort & Spa for three nights and went here (Bellamia) every day as it was very convenient - walking distance from the hotel. Linda, the owner was an absolute delight to talk to. She makes the gelato fresh every day. The crepes - ( we tried Nutella with banana ) are amazing and the gelato is delicious! We tried four  different flavors and they were all really really good! (strawberry, vanilla, hazelnut and stracciatella) She's also got crispy crepes that you can get with gelato and fruit purée. Cappuccino was really good - perfectly prepared. Will definitely come back. The store front is also adorable- the interior is very inviting and refreshing.  If you are in the area, this little gem is definitely worth a visit. Your taste buds will thank you :)"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! I just had the best gelato in the world! Lake Las Vegas BellaLinda great service great food great company!"}
{"text":"Darling place but even more important, the gelato makes you believed you have savored enough of life and can now happily cash it in and know you have lived! Linda the proprietor, only a few months here from Italy is passionate about her gelato and it shows. \"Here, try this one too!\"  And her charm was unflagging even when a crowd came in. Don't miss this one."}
{"text":"By far the best gelato I've had here! Its nice to get away from the hectic city and find a jem like this. The service the owner Linda will give you, will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Wow! My family and I highly recommend this beautiful spot! What a delight to share exceptionally made gelato with my boys, overlooking a spectacular view of Lake Las Vegas! An easy walk from the Hilton. Many flavors of gelato - we shared vanilla, strawberry, and chocolate gelato! The crepes looked amazing but we decided to save that for our next visit. Thank you, BellaLinda!"}
{"text":"Such a cute place and the owner is so sweet. The gelato and Nutella crepe were amazing. I strongly recommend it"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for the Mardi Gras celebration at lake Las Vegas. Had a sweet tooth for some gelati. Went in and we were served by the owner herself Linda! What a sweetheart, so hospitable and genuine. Great product, amazing  flavors!. We will definitely be back!!  She puts her heart and soul into her passion and we definitely felt it and tasted it!  Bellissimo!!!"}
{"text":"The owner was delightful.  She asked me if I wanted to taste any flavors so I would know which one I wanted.  She's beautiful, sweet, and authentically Italian.  The service was great and so was the gelato.  I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful gelato! So many delicious flavors, and Linda will let you try every single flavor. We come every time we visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away in Lake Las Vegas. Foodies have longed for a place that serve great and authentic food: here's the place. Do not come in this place expecting altered versions of coffee or gelato: amazing drinks with a heaping of authenticity straight from Italy is what is served here. Try the small sized coffee (just like in Italy), and the delightful crepes. Come here for the food and drinks, and leave with a little piece of Italy."}
{"text":"My first Gelato experience and this was well worth the wait! The owner was so sweet and very helpful! Going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I really want to try this place!!  But my daughter went there about a month ago and they were still closed (even though it was February and the sign on the door said that they would only be closed in January).  I called there a few minutes ago and there was no answer, not even a voicemail greeting.  One other reviewer said that they are often closed and don't seem to follow a schedule."}
{"text":"By far the MOST DELICIOUS CREPES EVER!!   It was our first trip out to Lake Las Vegas, and BellaLinda Gelateria felt like being whisked to Italy to a cute little cafe. It sits on a corner of the village with beautiful views of the water by the entertainment stage.   We were greeted by Linda who was a total sweetheart!  She gave us a few of the gelatos to taste test, all which tasted fresh, authentic and heavenly!   We agreed with Linda's original recommendation of the Vanilla Cherry Swirl gelato to accompany the strawberry jam filled crispy crepes, added some chocolate syrup to top it off and it was SO SUPER YUMMY!!! Also had a great iced Americano!  BellaLinda was the perfect treat for a hot summer day! Definitely will be taking the drive out to Lake Las Vegas again for some crepes by the water."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Great espresso. Great little authentic shop. Wish it was closer to me."}
{"text":"Linda is the sweetest and this place has the best Gelato anywhere. My family stay in Lake Las Vegas so that we can enjoy this Gelato whenever we travel for business. Linda is the best and anything on the menu is awesome! Trust me, we've tried all of it."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! So adorable inside and Gelato is amazing! I had Marshmallow and another Italian  flavor but I don't remember the name it almost tasted like cookies & cream and she topped it with chocolate sauce it was delicious! I will definitely be back:)"}
{"text":"This coffee/gelato shop is overlooking Lake Las Vegas. I met Linda and she made me a cappuccino to remember. The inside feels like your in another country! Very well done. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Tiramisu ice cream is amazing.  Served in a waffle cone. Nothing better on a hot day.  Nice to sit outside by the lake."}
{"text":"It's a cute shop, but the service is awkward- most places encourage you to sample the flavors to pick what you want to order, and while this wasn't denied, the staff member helping us didn't seem thrilled. At other places, when a couple come in and ask for flavors, both people get samples, here it was like pulling teeth to ask to try the same flavor my friend sampled. Odd for a gelato store to have this perspective, to say the least.  Range of flavors was good- they had a few non-dairy options, and a few really creative flavors (orange-ricotta?). I got the coffee (not much flavor, TBH) and the banana (underrated, more of a sweet, cooked banana flavor rather than fresh!), and in the two minutes it took to ring me up, my cup was already melting all over the place. Perhaps their freezers need to be turned up, as this issue doesn't happen elsewhere.  Overall it's a cute location and the guy who helped us was polite. Prices were about on par with other spots, and they had a good selection of flavors. If you're in the area, stop by and check them out... but I wouldn't drive out here just for this spot.  TIP Location is right on the water by Lake Las Vegas Marina. FInd that, put your back to the water, and it's to the right by the grassy area near Essence & Herbs."}
{"text":"This gelateria is simply amazing! We live 5 minutes away from Lake Las Vegas and we absolutely love going there; I am Italian and whenever I go to Lake Las Vegas I feel at home. Bellamia gelateria is the cherry on top of the cake because now we love going there even more! Linda, the owner, is a real Italian, she's cute, gentle, always happy and truly cares for her customers! She loves kids and when she saw my 2-year old son she gave him a mini gelato cone, that was so nice of her! She encouraged me and my husband to taste the different gelato flavors and I have to say that it was hard to make a decision because they were all so good and creamy! I really love the way she decorated the store, it looks like a real Italian gelateria. I definitely recommend this gelateria and even if you live far from Lake Las Vegas you should go and check it out, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just had Strawberry Gelato. Was amazing. Linda the owner was nice a gracious. Cant wait to come back during summer."}
{"text":"Best gelato I have ever had if you are in the area come by and get sone gelato! owner are so nice :)"}
{"text":"I stopped in over the summer and had half passion fruit gelato, half coconut gelato in a cup. The passion fruit gelato was one of the best frozen treats I've ever had, hands down. The owner was incredibly sweet. Overall, I think this place is fantastic and I'd hate to see it go away!"}
{"text":"Love this place the ice cream is unreal!  It's for the best view!  Outside tables, friendly and generous staff.  Thanks you guys for the conversation and the positive vibes!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! And the owner, Linda, is so sweet and cares about each customer. She comes straight from Italy, can't get more authentic than that! They offer many gelato flavors, including tiramisu, birthday cake, and coffee. They also have cannolis and macaroons! Beautiful location right by the lake."}
{"text":"BellaLinda is soooo yummy!!! This is our little gem at Lake Las Vegas Montelago Village that we love to visit. She is so sweet and is an excellent cook. We come here for breakfast a few times a month and it's wonderful every time. We get the crepes. I get strawberry, hubby gets Nutella. (which is what I added a picture of). The Affogato coffee is to die for. When the coffee is strong, I'm in love. It's espresso with a scoop of gelato in it. I also get the tiramisu and chocolate gelato which is so tasty, especially in this heat. Thank you for the amazing experiences each time we come!"}
{"text":"Best crepes ever!! Owner is the sweetest person and you get the best customer service.  We live in the city and been here 4 different times. We've tried the gelato, latte, crepes and macaroons all have been delicious. When you visit lake Las Vegas you must make a stop here."}
{"text":"If you if come to Lake Las Vegas this place is a must to go. We love their Gelato & shakes!! Let's not forget the crepes & cupcakes too. I just wanted to stay here and eat everything they have!!"}
{"text":"What a cute little cafe! It was very small. There is more seating outside than inside. The glossy white bar separated the ordering area from the coffee and ice cream stations.  Fantastic cappucino but no flavored syrups and such a small cup. It was super hot and tasted like heaven. I needed 3 of those cups to do anything though.   I had the friendly barista add caramel, and it was 90 cents more. I would go back, but for $4.90 I got one small styrofoam cup of cappuccino. There was no option of anything larger, sadly."}
{"text":"Man that Salted Caramel Gelato was on fire.The yogurt Berry is my second favorite. If you don't know, now you do."}
{"text":"BEST. CREPES. EVER.   Seriously. This place was amazing. My boyfriend and I came to Lake Las Vegas for a date and decided to try this cute little Gelato shop. The decor is adorable with lavander stripes and everything has their brand logo on it.   We both got crispy crepes, his with dulce de leche and mine with the rich cream. Extremely creamy and rich. Tastes like they make it from scratch, I don't know. The crepes themselves are SO fluffy and amazing, I wanted to compare them to pancakes. They don't compare to any of the places in Las Vegas and Henderson.   We ended up driving back a few days later to eat them again and we live in centennial which is about 50 minutes away.  Thank you again so much to the owner. She was extremely kind! I will only be coming here for their ice cream and crepes from now haha."}
{"text":"Such a cute little shop!! The gelato was AMAZING and they went above and beyond to make the concoction my mom, sister and I wanted!! Have an affogato style gelato because it's the best thing ever!! Even though it was busy she made everyone feel welcome and hot everything out as quickly as possible and when we went back for our credit card we accidentally left she met us at the door with it. Definitely a great spot to get a sweet treat on a hot day!"}
{"text":"Variety and quality of gelato are outstanding! My husband and I stumbled upon this lovely little place while exploring near our hotel, Hilton Lake Las Vegas. Definitely make a stop and taste the gelato or order a coffee. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So authentic and delicious! The owner just moved here from Italy a year ago and they show true Italian love and hospitality! My sister got the caffe latte and I got the affogato(espresso shot with gelato) it was so good!"}
{"text":"Love little Gelato shop, with legit cappuccino and gelato, crispy crepes so delicious! Sweet service too!"}
{"text":"Gelato!! It was delicious and refreshing, I had the lemon and raspberry sorbet. My son tried the strawberry yogurt gelato and it was great. We also had a couple chocolate chip cookies but those were really dry and hard. My daughter didn't eat them. I'm giving it only 3  because the tables were not clean. We sat down outside and all the tables were dirty with ice cream melted on it and others with dishes. Over all the gelato was great, I will give it another chance when it's not so busy. Hopefully my experience will be a little better."}
{"text":"Autumn was awesome! We were in the area for an event and although she was the only one working at the time, she served each one of us quickly with a smile. The gelato was awesome and the coffee was great. 5 stars both for the impeccable service and the great food."}
{"text":"Such a gem of a place! The location is BEAUTIFUL and the gelato is incredibly good. We got the birthday cake and the salted caramel. Very high quality and fresh. Will definitely be coming back! Thanks again, Linda!"}
{"text":"This little gelateria at Lago Las Vegas serves the very  best gelato I've had in a very long time. Linda ( the owner) is truly a sweetheart. I am Italian living in Arkansas and I can really tell you her gelato is really Italian. Thank you Linda for your kindness, your conversations , I wish you the very best . Keep up your good work. I wish I lived closer so I could come and eat gelato from your place everyday.                              Renata"}
{"text":"A very cute shop with delicious Vegan options and very friendly service! The Watermelon Gelato was amazing :)  We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"THE BEST GELATO IVE EVER HAD! The service here was great and the girls there were VERY kind. The shop itself was cute and a great place to just go in and have something to eat.  We had the mango, lemon, and salted caramel and all three were amazing."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were enjoying a staycation at Lake Las Vegas today and stumbled upon a beautiful Gelato shop. The owner was so friendly and welcoming and the flavors were delicious! I highly suggest stopping by after a relaxing day on the water. We will definitely be coming back soon! :)"}
{"text":"Soft opening today for the newest shop in the Village at Lake Las Vegas. They are working on hours etc but you should definitely stop by. I had the vanilla and the orange, ricotta and almond gelato. Both were amazing. I just returned from Italy 4 weeks ago and this is as good as anything I had in the gelato shops in Italy. Make the trip, it is worth it. They will soon be serving coffee, espresso and crepes!"}
{"text":"BellaLinda Gelato is an amazing place to get an authentic gelato or macaroon! I live over in Summerlin and this was worth the drive just for the crepes. I'm defiantly going to be coming back soon. The owner takes great pride in her work and the prices are very fair. If you're in the Las Vegas area, take the drive to come here. It is worth it."}
{"text":"Review #097 - 2017  I actually held off on writing this review because I wasn't sure if my credit card was going to make its way back to me & it did.  Thank you!  I showed up around 4:30 PM on Tuesday, May 2, after our little mother-daughter Hoover Dam tour.  It was dying hot during our drive back to our hotel so I decided to search for the nearest gelato spot and BellaLinda Gelato popped up with 4.5 stars so I started driving there.  After I got to the area, Google Map told me to park at the deserted parking lot above the out of business casino (I forget the name) so I had a hard time finding the shop & called to ask exactly where they were located.  This area is very secluded and you can see signs posted all over asking people not to take pictures and post them on social media.  I guess I must have ventured out into the wrong neighborhood since I love taking pictures of everything.  I finally find the hidden shop and was greeted by a very sweet young lady.  I ordered a small cup of gelato, which I was able to choose up to 2 flavors so I asked for the berry and the cheesecake.  Unfortunately, the gelato was kind of disappointing because I could taste that it was kind of old & ice crystals were starting to form from the few bites I took & ended up tossing the rest.  I hadn't eaten all day so I was hoping to find something that I could use in place of a meal so I ordered the Nutella crepe with some bananas.  Thank goodness the crepe was good.  I also enjoyed a nice cup of cappuccino with my so called meal.  I would've rated the place at a 3 or 3.5 at most, but since I ended up leaving my credit card there and couldn't drive back to pick it up before I flew back home, the owner was kind enough to mail it back to my house.  This definitely shows that they are willing to go above and beyond to make sure that their customers are well taken care of."}
{"text":"Stopped in after an afternoon kayaking on the lake. If you're at Lake Las Vegas (or even if you just feel like taking a drive out) I highly recommend stopping by by for a refreshing, house-made Italian treat."}
{"text":"Owner is amazing! She's super welcoming and her amazing customer services shows much she loves her business. I ordered the Nutella crepe and it was absolutely delicious! I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We were looking for somewhere to eat dinner and stumbled across the most charming gelato shop. The owner has a pleasant demeanor and is as adorable as the ambiance. Stop by today!"}
{"text":"We went to Las Vegas last November and there was this cafe we had to try by our hotel. BellaLinda Gelato has nice decor, despite some limited space inside. The owner was really nice and took her time with our orders. You can have your gelato or drink outside if the weather is nice. Sure, it's not open in the morning and the opening/closing hours weren't clear, but it was worth the wait. The crepes are homemade right in front of you; did you know there's such a thing as a \"crepe iron\"? That's how the owner makes them. Crepes are topped with powdered sugar, but you can also have them stuffed too. Yes, you can have your gelato on top as well, that's what I did. I had my crepe stuffed with nutella and topped with a scoop of chocolate gelato and a scoop of marshmallow gelato. The marshmallow gelato was unbelievable. Not only did it taste like a real marshmallow, but I can tell the owner doesn't use any artificial ingredients or colors in her gelato. This was the first time I had REAL crepes, it was soft, fluffy, thick and crisp around the edges. Nothing at all like those cheap crepes that are thin and bland in fast food chains. BellaLinda also offers cookies, soup, coffee, milkshakes and macaroons. If we ever go back to Las Vegas, even if we don't get the same hotel, we got to come back here."}
{"text":"Adorable shop! Linda, the owner was so nice and her Italian accent is awesome! Yummy gelato and the whole atmosphere is a quaint little escape"}
{"text":"Sweets with a view! We got the crispy crepe with strawberry gelato and banana. Sampled the marshmallow gelato and loved it.   Lake las Vegas has an amazing atmosphere, so take your sweets for a walk around the shops or sit at the adirondack chairs next to the water.   Must try! Plus mention yelp and get a discount."}
{"text":"Great gelato!!!!!Bella donna!!! Great place to relax!"}
{"text":"The lady who works here is amazing. And she made me the BEST Affogato I've ever tasted. Truly remarkable and dedicated ambassador of the finer desserts, this woman. I wish there could be a BellaLinda Gelato on every corner I tell you. I would probably never sleep from the sugar, but I would need the energy to walk to the next location. This reminds me - can anyone explain how Affogato is not our national beverage by now? Come on!"}
{"text":"The service is great!i The location is really small and outside is too hot , so not everyone wanted to stay and enjoy the gelato. The plates are really cheap and my stuff almost fell. overall the place is a good spot for some quick gelato."}
{"text":"I loved this place . The lady at the cashier I guess she is Italian she is so friendly . We had espresso ! Affogato coffee it's so delish"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The crispy crepe is delicious.  The gelato is very good.  I absolutely love the coffee!  To all Europeans searching for a coffee as good as the one back home, this is the place for you! The only place in Las Vegas, that knows what cappuccino and espresso should taste like.  The owner Linda is amazing too.  You must try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Ok... so my whole staycation was ruined. Thanks to Las vegas water sports. But that's a whole other review. I was looking for a place to cheer up my wife and toddler. I found this place on yelp.... 2 scoops of premium chocolate and tiramisu priced at a very modest $6.50 later.... were all happy again. Toddler buddy is screaming for more and I'm fat and want some more. Employees were wonderful and the shop has a small parlor feel. I will NEVER come back to lake las vegas again I said... but now I have to. Best gelato in town!"}
{"text":"My family visited Lake Las Vegas this afternoon. We stopped by this amazing place for a quick afternoon delight and found out the owner Linda makes French crepes on the premises. It was the most delicious crepes I have had since I visited France awhile back. Stop by to say hi to Linda and don't forget to try their gelato too. I definitely will go back there for their sweets."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing customer service! The view! Love lake Las Vegas!! Please come! You will love it! Come support this local spot!!"}
{"text":"So delicious!!! We really enjoyed the hazelnut and coconut on a hot day in Lake Las Vegas. It was a popular place for everyone walking around. Check it Out!"}
{"text":"This place was perfect for an evening treat. Walked in not knowing what to expect and absolutely love the Gelato vibe. The owner was so good to my children, who typically takes for ever to decide their flavor. She was patient and was so quick to offer samples. She truly cares what her customers wants. I highly recommend this gem. Their Gelatos were very flavorful."}
{"text":"Beautiful Linda!  Our daughter came with us to this gem in quaint Lake Las Vegas.  Situated right along the water, it's the perfect place to rest and have high-end tea, fresh and delicious homemade gelato, or even cannolis.  Linda, the shop owner is a gracious host.  She is from Italy and she is awesome.  Her favorite colour is purple and you will notice this with sweet touches of purple all over the innocently charming decor.  While we are visiting here, we plan to visit every day.  You (and your tummy) leave here feeling a little more loved.  Lissa loves BellaLinda!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem.. deliciously made crispy crepes made with strawberry filling topped with bananas and vanilla ice cream.  Excellent quick service.  A place to visit if your in Las Vegas or in Henderson Nevada"}
{"text":"This is such an authentic Italian experience.  The owner is from Italy and is very engaged with her customers ensuring they have a positive experience.  The gelato is made onsite and is the real deal.  Other items are served including espresso which is just like you get in Italy.  I would highly recommend BellaLinda, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is probably the most generous three star rating I've given. They frankly don't deserve that many, but I'm trying to present the most informative perspective that I can while remaining unbiased, which is difficult for reasons that you'll read soon. If you just care about the gelato, fast forward to the middle of this review.  Judging from their web site, Bellamia is a gelato franchiser that originated in Italy. This franchise is at The Village at Lake Las Vegas, and it is the first in the United States. As a lover of gelato, I was very curious to try out this new place after I'd heard about its opening a few weeks ago, so I stopped by during a Pokemon Go event that had already lured me nearby.  Exterior signage is non-existent, and the maps of the place are awful. The map spot was way off (and hopefully will be corrected soon), but it's at the corner of a building that's near the lake itself. There's some counter seating on some rather awkward high chairs, but you might wanna plan to take the gelato outside if it's too crowded.  MAJOR NEGATIVES FROM TODAY:  My big gripes with this place are service/hospitality. When I asked the owner if I could sample some flavors (which most places are very happy to do), she replied curtly that I could try one or two. A surprising response, but I went ahead and limited myself to two. Later on during my visit, I decided to use an outlet in the back corner (NOT even close to behind the counter at all) to charge my phone after I'd seen another customer ask and receive permission to do so. The owner eventually noticed this and scolded me, saying that she did not allow charging.  Ignoring a possible \"lost in translation\" effect (which I personally couldn't because I've met plenty of kind, charming people with foreign accents), these can objectively be seen as two issues: not letting potential customers sample the product (which, I reiterate, is a very common practice at ice cream and gelato shops), and not providing a common courtesy to a paying customer. This was probably the most productive day of their business so far and she's being stingy over maybe a couple bucks on the power bill? C'mon. I was at three excellent small businesses in Las Vegas today alone and none of them had a problem with customers plugging in for a bit of juice.  Both of these issues made me feel very unwelcome, and I'm not sure that I'll be back even if I return to this area (and it's the first time I've been to Lake Las Vegas after 5 years residing relatively nearby). I just decided to give less weight to this whole situation when settling on a rating. Call it giving the benefit of the doubt if you will.  INFO ABOUT THE ACTUAL GELATO:  As for the gelato itself, I selected a \"large\" cup ($5.50, not all that large but not unreasonably priced) and maxed out on the 4 flavors that the menu board said I could have. The hazelnut wasn't quite as rich as I've experienced at other places, but it was good enough. The ricotta cheese with orange zest and caramelized almonds was fun, with sweet crunchy almonds and a distinct but not overwhelming orange tone. The crunchy rum was a little strong on the rum but otherwise wasn't bad. Finally, the passion fruit (which I'd been craving for a while) seemed fairly authentic and was definitely quite tart when eaten after other flavors.  The flavors all tasted pretty good, and the texture was consistently soft and smooth with no ice crystals. The one downside, which is a pretty significant one, is that everything melted very quickly even in the air-conditioned shop interior, as I observed with my own cup and with other people's treats. It's scary that it would've become sweet milk soup even faster if I had taken it outside.  By the way, I saw a Bellamia-branded publication on the counter in the corner next to those power outlets. There are 38 gelato and 19 sorbet flavors in this book (I'm not sure whether this shop rotates different flavors regularly, and I didn't ask because they were busy and shall-we-say curt), and most tend toward classic flavors. The book contains a comprehensive ingredient list (which originally tipped me to the commercial/chain nature of the business), perhaps to inform people who may have particular allergies. But I also noticed that many of the ingredients are what would generally be called \"natural,\" while others are regarded as \"chemicals\" (see photos for examples). I'm not a stickler for natural stuff, but I'm mentioning this in case some are.  I had a very colorful experience at Bellamia that was negative in multiple ways, but I'd still say that you can try it if you're at Lake Las Vegas and need a sweet frozen treat. But don't go out here if it's just because you're a gelato connoisseur. Just stick to the multiple superior gelaterias in Las Vegas proper. To me, this is not \"gelato as it should be\" (rough translation of their slogan) in more ways than one."}
{"text":"Rating this place one star because in the first week of February, I was seriously craving gelato and decided to drive up here & check it out. Couldn't find any buisness hours posted on here or Google, tried calling but the phone just kept ringing. It was early in the afternoon on a weekday so I assumed they would be open. After parking my car and walking around the cute little area on lake Las Vegas to find the place, lo and behold there's a sign posted on the door saying that they were closed throughout the month of January and how they looked forward to seeing you February 1st. Once again, this was the first week of February and they were still closed. Very dissapointed! :("}
{"text":"Super cute shop . Once we entered the grumpy man behind the counter didn't even say hi he just asked in an annoyed way if we were all together ?!?! Maybe because my hubby is white and I'm brown and our kids look in between I have no idea . For a place that is somewhat like a ghost town it seems the people behind the counter would be a little nicer to their patrons . Next time I'll just go to The seasons market and grab some ice cream for the kids . They aren't grumpy .  Oh and gelato is just ok . We've had better :)"}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH!!!! DELICIOUS!! I am Italian and rarely eat \"gelato\" at most establishments because it's rarely gelato and mostly just ice cream. But the beautiful, sweet owner is from Padova Italy  and she brought her authentic recipes to US!! MMMMMMMMM!!! I'm in heaven. This is a MUST if you're in Las Vegas. Worth the drive off the strip to lake Las Vegas. Plus the location is on the lake, at the bottom of a relaxing stroll through the shops, it feels a little like Tuscany. Molto delizioso!!!!"}
{"text":"The gelato was very delicious, and there were many flavors to choose from. You can also have it rolled into a crepe, which is creative and also absolutely divine! Our family loved talking to the owner, she was very kind and has worked hard on developing her business."}
{"text":"The shop here is cute but not very good gelato and very little options. My husband and I got shakes and they were like chocolate milk. Only two little scoops of gelato and a ton of milk. Mine tasted like vanilla milk I couldn't taste the coffee flavor that I got at all. They were pretty spendy as well $6.50 each for a small cup. Were we bummed as we love gelato. We wouldnt return to this location."}
{"text":"My son stopped by this afternoon for a milkshake and we are back for a second!!! I also ordered a vanilla shake and my husband had a cannoli. It was all wonderful!! The owner makes the gelato and it is authentic, delicious and I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Positives for this gelato shop are the great location in the village area and the gelato is pretty good. The negatives would be a small selection (eight flavors when I visited) and the flavors are basic. Pricing seemed a bit high for what you get too. The shop also sells some prepackaged cookies, cake pops, and cupcakes. Overall, this shop will help satisfy a craving for sweets."}
{"text":"Amazing gelato! Love this amazing place, and the owner is so welcoming. Guys if you're in Henderson, stop and grab a delicious gelato!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Worth the 30min drive every time. This is not a typical gelato place. It is a specialty high quality gelateria. Had the pleasure to talk to the owner for 20min last time and got educated on how this place is special. It is a true gem with different flavors every time I visit. My favorite is the tangerine and the cheesecake. One time I had the crapes and they were awesome too."}
{"text":"This Gelato brought me right back to Rome! It was absolutely delicious and such a cute little shop :)  BellaLinda Gelateria is a MUST try! Plan a trip out to Lake Las Vegas and relax outside of the city with some truly authentic Italian Gelato. It is well worth the drive!  (And stay a while and chat with the owner Linda if it's not too busy and you have time - we had a lovely conversation and she's just the sweetest)  Can't wait to go back again!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't die, lol. This is always a positive when I eat anywhere as I have lots of severe food allergies. I was able to have any of the delicious sorbets and chose strawberry which tasted like fresh hand picked strawberries. The owner Linda was very accommodating and got a fresh batch from in back which ensured it had no contamination from dairy  Great choice for vegans or dairy free."}
{"text":"Great service! great gelato! Owner was so very hospitable and friendly! Will definitely be back again! Thanks"}
{"text":"Found in the nick of time.  it was tooo hot out and I was fade'n fast.  Nutella Crepe was perfect pick me up.  Thank You"}
{"text":"Linda, the owner is SO nice & friendly! She explained the menu to us and let us tried different samples! This little place is seriously such a gem. You have to try the Crispy Nutella Crepes! They were delicious!  would recommend over and over again!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes and gelato!! We got the Crispy Crapes and they are to die for!! The owner is as sweet as the shop! She let us sample as many flavors as we wanted and was super kind! We will be returning very soon!!"}
{"text":"If you find yourself in or near Lake Las Vegas for any reason, be sure to check out the little village area behind the currently-defunct casino. There are some hidden gems here, but this is the shiniest. The proprietor is warm, welcoming and accommodating. We got to try a number of gelato samples before deciding on flavors. The gelato and the cones are excellent! Some of the best gelato I've tasted in the USA.   A couple of us enjoyed cappuccino. The preparation was absolutely perfect, just like you'd get in Italy! No overcooked milk or burned-roast like you get in many large coffee chains. The flavor was delicious.   There's just a few seats inside, but plenty of seating outside, which usually isn't an issue with Henderson's weather. I really like this place and will definitely be back; next time to try some Crêpes."}
{"text":"Great little Gelato place at Lake Las Vegas.  Staff was very friendly and the gelato was delicious. You can tell it's freshly made.   It is a little bit pricey but you have to expect that when you go to Lake Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a generous 3 star review. I was so, so hopeful about this place. Great branding and after reading about it, I was hoping for real quality.  My disappointment stems from quality. My children ordered a milkshake each and were asked if they wanted whip cream and to pick between caramel and chocolate (which didn't really seem to go with an orange milkshake/ peach mango milkshake). They picked between the 2 and when I paid the upsells of whipped cream (0.60) and a drizzle of sauce (0.90) were added to each. Now, for an $8 milkshake, it should taste great and the cup should be full. It was average at best and the cup was filled 3/4 way. Not sure if this is because the volume isn't there and they need to make each transaction worthwhile but in that case quality does too."}
{"text":"Affogato time ! I'm a sucker for a good affogato, especially when it's some good vanilla ice cream. This place is at the South Lake Hilton resort. It's quite nice to be able to walk out of your hotel and go down this lil town village they have created.  Along the way you'll fine various shops and restaurants, but as they say save the best for last  that would be gelato!"}
{"text":"The girl working there was exceptionally helpful. We asked her tons of questions about their special gelato panini, gelato flavors and she even offered a delicious idea for a double cone with chocolate inside the cone with their most popular flavor, stracciatella, and toasted marshmallow. It was like a glorious gelato s'more. Amazing! The gelato was very creamy, but not so much that it would make you sick. Yum!"}
{"text":"We had a fabulous weekend at Lake Las Vegas, we found this cute little shop owned by Linda. The gelato is amazing and the cappuccino is to die for. Linda is such a sweetheart and we will be back again and again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place even greater manager! best ice cream I've tasted in Las Vegas!!!  highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"The best Gelato I've had since I was in Italy.  With that said.  Do not finish your dinner with dessert but finish it with going to Bella Linda Gelato.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"1st know that it's cash only in a world where plastic is supreme. The guy serving didn't seem to want to give samples, so I still don't know what \"bacio\" is. I was ahead of a couple yet the server helped them who was in back of me instead. The Gelato is like the rest, but probably not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"This place is the best!!! A cute space to satisfy a sweet tooth. Ice cream is so good!! There're many flavors to try and all of them are delicious. The owner is the nicest lady, very friendly and always smiling. Highly recommended if you visit Lake Las Vegas some time."}
{"text":"Yum! Authentic gelato on a super hot day. Beautiful location. Watched a wakeboarding competition and listened to live mariachi bands for Cinco de Mayo celebrations. Really love the area of lake Las Vegas. Great family getaway from the hustle and bustle of the strip!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Delicious gelato and affogatto was a real treat.  Love this place.  Will be coming back real soon"}
{"text":"Love this cute little gelato shop! The owner, Linda, is super sweet and helpful. We've tried several gelato flavors and loved them all, but the Pistachio was our favorite. We are looking forward to coming back when we visit Lake Las Vegas next summer. Thanks again, Linda!"}
{"text":"In love with this place , I had the lemon flavor ice cream , so yummy . The owner is so nice and friendly ."}
{"text":"Wow... Shocked at the attitude of the young girl Carmen who works here.  Ordered crepe and asked how it came. The girl pointed to a photo showing a crepe with gelato, chocolate sauce and whipped cream said it comes like this. I asked for banana/Nutella with 1 extra scoop of gelato. She asked if I want whipped cream and chocolate sauce. I said sure. (Not knowing this was an extra charge.) When I got the bill I was charged extra for everything. When I asked about it Carmen interrupted and said this is just how we do it and pointed to the board stating extra toppings with charges. I said, you guys told me that this is what comes on top of a crepe. You should tell customers what is extra. Don't just offer it if it doesn't come with it. And don't explain that it comes with it in the first place if it doesn't.   Her response was \"if you don't like it, you can write a yelp review\". What a total lack of customer service and lack or respect for the owner to antagonize a customer to write an unfavorable yelp review. Good luck with that!  Later, Carmen apologized and said that people usually ask for their money back when they realize the were charged for each thing. She didn't want to refund me. When she realized that I was just explaining customer service expectations of communication to avoid frustrated customers and she said she never thought to tell people what toppings cost extra. She thanked me for the explanation."}
{"text":"Go see beautiful Llinda at the quaint village of Lake Las Vegas!  We shared a decadent, splurge Nutella Crepe with a scoop of hazelnut Gellato and chocolate sauce.  It was a taste of authentic Italy and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice and fresh gelato! You can definitely taste the fresh fruit in it. So refreshing! Got a \"kids\" size for $4.50. A little pricey but not bad for the location. Lady working was super friendly. Good customer service is always a plus."}
{"text":"The gelato in Fresno, CA is more authentic than this stuff. We drove 20 minutes from our hotel to get what Yelp said was great gelato. No offense, but no one who thinks this gelato is great could have actually ever had great gelato. Should have stayed at my hotel and eaten Ben & Jerrys."}
{"text":"Great place by the lake at Lake Las Vegas. Linda was so kind and gave us samples before choosing. The flavors are so delicious! She informed us that gelato is a much creamier version of ice cream with much less sugar. I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!!  I have found a proper coffee and true handmade gelato.  One of the drawbacks of being lucky enough to get to spend many years in Europe is, coffee in the US is not so \"special\".  AND, American ice cream can be wonderful, but real hand made Gelato is an art. Linda is an artist. AMAZING - Thank you"}
{"text":"Stracciatella gelato in a warm made to order crepe was THE best idea. Such a cute shop located at Lake Las Vegas. It was surrounded by the water and local shops. After ordering, feel free to roam and take in the beauty of the area. Though, if buying a crepe, I suggest downing the gelato for it will melt!"}
{"text":"Amazing gelato!!!! It was like I was in Milan having a scoop!! If your in the area please check it out!!"}
{"text":"Found this brand new gem on our after dinner stroll through the shops next to the Hilton at Lake Las Vegas. Got to meet the owner from Italy who was extremely nice and had great recommendations on flavor combinations.   Check it out and enjoy your Gelato on the patio overlooking the serene lake"}
{"text":"Love love love awesome, good, tasty, tea gelato. Did not have such a good gelato in quite a bit.  Not sure why some people are complaining about service - for me it was great. The girl was nice - I am buying ice cream - I don't need any special treatment and I'm happy as long as they are nice and courteous (.. and they serve me good ice cream). I would recommend this place. We tried banana, strattaciella,  yoghurt and berries, and toasted marshmallow. All flavors were delicious - my favorite one was banana."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful Cafe in the beautiful Lake Las Vegas Montelego village. Great crepes, real Italian Gelato and Linda is amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a very cute shop and I find all things purple to be cute! Their gelato is also very good! My favorite was the almond and especially the rich cream. Not many gelato shop serves rich cream and that's why I love this place! Totally recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"After a hot day out on the water, gelato was exactly what I needed. It's a little pricey but oh so hits the spot!"}
{"text":"This gelato was incredible. Serving for a small was enough for two people, but, this gelato was so good, I considered eating it myself. Before choosing, we tried passion fruit and orange ricotta. I loved both but chose the latter combined with chocolate. Mm mm! Sadly, tried to go back today, but they're closed Tuesdays!!  Creamy, flavorful, pretty friendly staff. A great new spot!"}
{"text":"The lady offered ice cream samples. She was very friendly. The pistachio, vanilla and salted caramel is so good! Highly recommended. Cute little shop!"}
