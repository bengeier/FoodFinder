{"text":"Persian treat steps from Finch subway station:  Our dining group came across this place by accident. It has a small storefront and is very unassuming. The decor is simple and very plain. Don't let that put you off. The food is amazing. Each one of us ordered something different from the picture/description menus on the wall (and there are ones behind the cash, which does not necessarily have the same items).  Everyone was very happy with what they ordered and very complimentary. The food was freshly made, tender and tasty. The flavouring was well balanced and delicious. Prices range from $8.99-12.99, depending on the amount and type of meat you order.  The tea + baklava ($2.99) is a must. When I complemented the unusual (and deliciously appealing) flavour of the black tea, he told me, \"I have a secret ingredient\". After some coaxing, he told me what it was but I promised to keep his secret! The 2\" square of baklava is a nice finisher to the meal and is, thankfully, not overly sweet.  I have been back since with another group of friends, and the same attentive service, quality and quantity of food holds. Sit-in or take-out, you are in for a Persian treat!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Persian food in North York, I have tried every Persian food place from Sheppard to Steels and you will not find any place else that's better.    The owner really cares about food quality and uses only the best meats and freshest ingredients.  The Koobideh kabob is by far the best I've had, but all of their dishes are great.  You can get it to go or eat there, it's not the fanciest place but it's very cozy, clean and welcoming.   Honestly there isn't any other restaurant I would eat at other than Tah Deeg around Finch, at least you know what you're eating is healthy and freshly made."}
{"text":"A tiny little gem! The service has been good almost every time I have gone here for food. The Koobideh is full of flavor and life. The barg is good for the most part, I have only on one occasion gotten it a bit dry. If the owner is there and you ask for the chicken he will ask you if you wish to have your chicken juicy or well done. He does an amazing job cooking the food and the rest of the staff are good as well. Overall I definitely I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The kebab itself was very delicious and juicy. But the rice was disappointing as well as the small tah dig came beside it. I would only consider this place for a koobideh take out."}
{"text":"I went to a restaurant on Yonge and Finch for lunch. I got the lamb special which was two minced lamb with charred tomato and rice. I added lots of paprika. Yes it was $18.60 with a coke but it was damned delicious!"}
{"text":"I was there last week whit my friends I never ever go back there .. it was a nightmare .don't  try it waste of money and time. ...boooo"}
{"text":"I've been walking past this place for over a year, and finally got a chance to try out Iranian cuisine. I was not disappointed!  My dad's a huge fan of middle eastern food, so he did most of the ordering. Most of the dishes consisted of meat and rice. The chicken and lamb were really juicy and flavorful despite the dry/slightly burnt exterior.   I might come back here, but I'd rather stick to the Korean options in this area."}
{"text":"This place has great Kebabs! I've never ordered anything from them except their kebab plate, which comes with 2 delicious grilled ground beef skewers and a mountain of rice. However, unfortunately I stopped going after trying other kebab places on Yonge, which had the same meal cooked just as well for less. While the kebab plate used to cost $6.99 plus tax, when prices raised to $7.99 it just wasn't as great a deal, especially when ordering two for dinner with the boyfriend, and considering our meager student budget. However, if price isn't an issue and your a fan of great kebabs, definitely give this place a try! The staff is super friendly too :)"}
{"text":"Good, tasty takeout Persian food. A bit pricey but I would say it's the best Persian in the area."}
{"text":"Always get their food as take out and call ahead of time. The koobideh, vaziri and zeresht poli are my fav! They used to include a free drink with a meal but then they stopped. I come here more because Taftan doesnt have the zeresht polo on their menu. Also their koobideh tastes way better than taftans."}
{"text":"This is a fine Persian restaurant. You have your standard kebob dishes but you also have the stews. Everything I've tried was good.   The noticeable difference with this restaurant is the guy behind the counter. He is so nice.   Prices are reasonable, though slightly higher than Super Khorak a few blocks north. The quality of the food is good. As usual for Persian meals, kebobs come with a ton of rice. This is not plain rice. For some reason, the rice at Persian places are delicious on their own even without additional condiments. Meal comes with free pop which is nice.   This restaurant is A-OK. I'd still prefer Super Khorak to this place partly because it's closer, and partly because SK is a little cheaper. SK also has greater selection of authentic Persian foods. But if I happened to be closer to Tah Deeg than SK, I'd go with Tah Deeg."}
{"text":"This place was really good...it's my first time here and I will definitely come back soon. We usually go for Taftan which is across the street, but we won't anymore, that place has dry kebabs plus it's noisy and messy...."}
{"text":"Best koobideh I've had. Love this place and highly recommend it. Prices are fair too and the owner is really nice. He gave me and my friends a couple free dishes to try because it was our first time there."}
{"text":"We were craving middle eastern food so we decided to give this place a try. The place is really small. Kabab took about 20 minutes to be served. Plates come with rice and a grilled tomato. I recommend that you stick to regular kabab as it was really juicy while saffron kabab was a little dry (Both were fresh though, its just that the saffron makes it taste a little dry). Portions are huge. Prices are about $10-20 per plate. Overall it was an A-OK experience. The food was tasty but the dine in experience was mediocre simply because the furnitures here are tiny and I have been spoiled with huge booths at other restaurants. Service was good though and they got free WiFi. This place is perfect for take out and not so much for dinning in."}
{"text":"After experiencing other Kebab shops in the area, I'm afraid that Tah Deeg just doesn't cut it for me anymore.  I don't know what exactly has changed with their meat but I'm finding that the fat content is way too high and the meat tastes almost... sweet.  We were here last week for dinner (takeout) and I had loaded up my Koobideh with hot sauce before leaving. When I got home, it tasted like I had poured liquid sugar on it. When I came here yesterday for lunch, I made sure not to add anything to my Koobideh so I could taste the meat on it's own. Nope, still sweet. Strange.  It was especially noticeable since I just had Koobideh Thursday night for dinner at Sardab and it was fantastic. It would seem that, when you eat as much Koobideh as I do, the variances in the meat become apparent.   Their prices have also gone up making them no longer competitive with the surrounding restaurants.  I'll give Tah Deeg one thing though, their Barley Soup is delicious! Unfortunately, it's not enough to keep them on my 'Friday Favs' list."}
{"text":"I love Taah Deeg's food!!! My wife and I eat here regularly. We recommend their food to the world!!!"}
{"text":"I needed some late night grub to carry me over 'til morning and, having already tried two other Persian restaurants in the area in the past 36 hours, felt compelled to give this place a shot. I strolled in 15 minutes before closing time and was warmly greeted - felt right at home in the cozy, dimly-lit surroundings. As soon as I placed my take-out order, the young man and woman behind the counter struck up a conversation with me. They were courteous and very friendly. My food was ready in minutes. Top-notch, prompt customer service, attention to detail, and a delicious meal - this place is my new Persian spot in North York."}
{"text":"Nice staff and food made on the grill right infront of you. Restaurant was clean and food was relatively cheap with many options (lots of vegetarian options too)"}
{"text":"We live close by and this is a regular haunt. The owner is real nice and they keep experimenting with their food. I love the fried fish + fava beans rice combo or the chicken + rice. They ahve this yummy yogurt dip which is made from shallots and garlic etc, great compliment with the food."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this quaint little restaurant as we were looking for korean BBQ and we were extremely happy to stop by!  Inside the place is small - about 2 - 4 man tables and a long bar-ish table that can seat 6-8 people. The menu is posted on the wall with pictures of everything.  It is a great comfy family run place - I think the owner is the chef and the daughter was manning the register. You can see all the kabob freshly made and stored on skewers in a fridge - the food is made to order!  So, being quite hungry we ordered:  Lamp chops - wow - excellent flavour and seasoning. For those who don't like the gamey flavour, their spices do a great job of blending it. You will smell a hint of lamb but it is not too strong. Personally, I love the lamb flavour -great dish!  Fesanjooh - this is a walnut pomegranate chicken stew. The chick thigh meat was super juicy with a sweet and tart stew sauce. This is is one of my fav places for it now.  Eggplant dip - I can't remember the exact name but this was an eggplant puree and garlic dip served with multi-grain pita. Smooth garlicky flavour!  Fish with dill&fava rice - The fish took a little longer as he made it fresh but it is excellent. It was coated with a thin batter and lightly fried - crisp on the outside and moist inside. The kicker was the rice - we loved the fava and dill rice - I could eat that by itself :)  Prices were very reasonable and we are now regulars!"}
{"text":"I'm not a koobideh fan, but my friends are. They were not too impressed with the safron koobideh and the regular koobideh was just mediocre. I sampled both of them and I have to agree with them. I got kashke bademjaan. It looked more like a soup, than the actual appetizer. The eggplant was hidden under the sea of kashk and fried mint. It looked very greasy. This place is more like a take out place."}
{"text":"First time trying Persian food, I must thank fellow Yelpers for pointing this place out and  highlighting #1 beef skewer as the best in North York. If it wasn't for all you lovely writers I would've missed this dinky little place and the orgasmic first Persian food experience.  Like I said, Tah Deeg just popped my cherry. And like all newbies, I have nothing else to compare it to, but solely on my first and only experience at Tah Deeg. I must say the skewers were displayed raw next to the cashier. Most may think this unsanitary to display such but it only tells me they were made to order instead of a big pile sitting in the back waiting to be ordered.  And when fellow Yelpers say it's reasonably priced.. they weren't kidding. $9 for a meal with generous portion of meat.. review posted pictures.   After this amazing experience, I'm excited and looking forward to trying more Persian food!!"}
{"text":"Solid.   It's been my mission for a while now to befriend a Persian person so that they could tell me what to eat and where. I'd been trying all the joints up and down Yonge up north by myself, never straying too far from the barbecued stuff. I was loving it but I wish I knew more about how people actually ate the foods, what they might choose, what combinations went well together, what else I should try, etc.  It took me a while - who knew my social circles were so homogenous? - but I finally met Sweetheart's colleague's wife, who is Persian, and she recommended this place. She said the chef used to work in a fancy restaurant back in the old country, or something.  I was really excited to try this place and it didn't disappoint (although again, I stuck to my go-to of the vaziri platter, which is a skewer of minced meat and a skewer of chicken - I prefer dark meat).   The meat was a little bit try but it was really well flavoured and everything was freshly prepared when we ordered them. The portions and prices were fair, although to be honest, some of the places around Yonge & Steeles that have no English menus at all seem to have slightly bigger portions for slightly lower prices. But this place is a step up, decor and ambience-wise.  Because this place is quite far from me and I have a closer option now, I probably won't make the trek all the way too often, but I did enjoy and would recommend it."}
{"text":"Good food, great grill entrees. They forgot my drinks when I ordered though which sucked and that is part of the reason I'm only giving 3 stars. Friendly staff made up for it though, delivery lady was so sweet I felt bad calling in and complaining about the drinks. Bon appetite yelpers"}
{"text":"I usually order their Koobideh because it's freshly grilled with loads of flavorful basmati rice and grilled tomato. Staff are also very friendly. Great place for filling dine and dash"}
{"text":"This was my first time experiencing Persian food and i was blown away. This restaraunt is a tiny hole in the wall and if you dont have a sharp eye, you could walk right by and miss it. Fortunately enough for me, the people i was with have 20/20 vision and my hazy eyes were not relied upon to find the place.   The food was excellent and very reasonably priced. The atmosphere is great with people of various backgrounds and ages hanging out enjoying great food and sharing some laughs.   The staff were smiling, happy and more than willing to serve you and help you out with any questions you may have had if you were a noob like me.  Overall an amazing experience and i'd definately be back to this spot for sure. I also cannot wait to try more Persian food at other locations, thanks Tah Deeg.   Wayne"}
