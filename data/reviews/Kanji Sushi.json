{"text":"Came here really wanting to like it since it's relatively close to home, but I was quite disappointed. The prices were very high for what we got.   While I do enjoy fusion, particularly Japanese fusion, this aspect was not well executed here. They served some spicy tuna on a Pringles chip and another concoction on a nacho chip... Perhaps that night they were short on tuna but all I could taste were the chips. Not good.   Also, we had a billing issue that the waitress and manager could not resolve so she consulted with the owner. Instead of coming over to talk to us, he simple said no and sent her back to us without an explanation. We always try to be gracious to waitstaff when there are problems with the billing because I believe that it is the establishment's responsibility, and so we told her that the bill is wrong but we will pay it to save her the trouble. But overall, this showed poor customer service on the owner's part."}
{"text":"We finally made it to kanji this week. Honestly I had been trying to go to this place for over a year but each time I tried, it was closed.   We found out that while the owners had been the same, the management had changed over a couple of times over the past year. Hence the constant opening and closing.   We were extremely pleased with our overall experience here. I was able to call the day of and make a reso for 2. They were very accommodating and responded to my voicemail promptly.   We had the crab meat salad which was So tasty and The treasure island - assorted sashimi pieces on avocado, nicely textures and to die for if you're a avocado lover. We also had the spicy dynamite roll again this was excellent. We were still a little hungry so we ordered another spicy tuna roll which was lovely as well. I think we ordered some other food too but I can't remember exactly what it was.   The staff was very pleasant as well. I think it was the manager who greeted us when we arrived and thanked us for coming. He came over a couple of times to see how we were which was nice  I think our waiter was new and being trained that night. He was nervous but was very friendly and attentive. He did a great job and we're sure that with practice he will be an excellent server.   The decor of the place is really contemporary and simple so that was nice and what's even better is that the prices were generally reasonable to us. We had a lot to eat and a drink each as well as desert and our bill was $80 after tax.   Will definitely go back to this place and would recommend it. It's so nice to have avgood sushi place close to us. I'm so excited!,"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place as there are no other sushi joints in the neighbourhood. Also, I saw that the executive chef has worked at Nobu and also Yuzu, so it couldn't be a bad thing, right?  I would classify Kanji as a place that is trying too hard, especially with the \"gallery\" in the front. The plates were far too large for the tables, and since the place was half empty on a Wednesday night at around 8pm, my friend and I ended up commandeering a second table just for our food. Great washrooms, though!  First impressions on the food were good. We had the avocado and tuna salad with citrus dressing, and it was fairly tasty. This was followed by okonomiyaki which was satisfactory (not enough sauce!), and a selection of rolls that included the Crazy Tuna roll and I think a tempura roll (cold and chewy). After a few tastes, everything on the plate started tasting the same. A lot of the dishes also have fried leeks on top, and this could perhaps have added to the sameness. Maybe we should have had some nigiri, as I couldn't really get a sense of the freshness of the fish.  All in all, I think the flavours would be more successful if they were more pared down and simple. There is only so much fried leeks can do."}
{"text":"Heard some good reviews about this place and thought to check it out for a Friday night dinner.  We ordered the sashimi salad, tempura, beef tataki, crazy tuna, sweet potato roll, sweet potato cheesecake and sake.  The food was mediocre.  I was expecting more based upon the hype - the only thing that was good if any is the sashimi salad.  The sweet potato cheesecake dessert sounded interesting but was a huge disappointment!  It was not fresh and extremely expensive for $9 considering the portion size.    Overall the service was good, but food highly over-rated - will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful, the vibe is great, the service friendly, the sake/vodka/lemon Mantango is delicious, and food poisoning is the secret ingredient.  The food tasted fine - not remotely bad in flavor. I had the spicy salmon which had just the right amount of spicy bite without drowning out the flavor of the salmon, and the cavi ecstasy which was a simple tuna sushi rolled with asparagus and topped with caviar. It was mild, the asparagus did nothing for the sushi and seemed extraneous.  They got my tempura order wrong. The table asked simply vegetable tempura - no shrimp. We were served shrimp non the less. When we to,d them of the mistake it was taken away for another table, and then we were served another bowl... Again with shrimp.  Odd.  They lose a star there.  But the worse was my friend who ordered the crazy tuna and the sushi Buddha - no drinks as she was staying dry for the night.  Well one of the two gave her food poisoning because less than an hour after the restaurant she became feverish - violently ill - and after dropping into bed, woke up fine the next day.... Sounds like food poisoning to me."}
{"text":"Toronto really doesn't have another place like Kanji With chef James running the show, this place puts out some of the tastiest, most creative sushi this city has ever seen It really is a different experience eating at Kanji....things that sound gimmicky are actually a stunning evolution....Crazy tuna roll with sweet and salty and textural contrasts that make it incredibly addictive...a sushi taco with a bevi of fresh foliage and spicy, savory and sweet sauces is the ultimate in fusion The quality is such that if you want to stick to the more conventional sushi menu you would be very very happy, but you'd be missing out I only worry that given the large space people will not realize the amazing find that is Kanji given it's hard to fill that space and stay away.....It even offers a pretty decent dessert selection (yuzu creme brule, anyone?).....this place is the real deal.... Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Pros: Washrooms are co-ed and individual. Clean and well kept. I like the little towels -very sustainable. Mirrors are a little confusing. Also, Kanji has good ambiance for date (low lighting, open concept, trendy music). The staff is friendly and insightful regarding the menu. The water and tea service is also top notch.  Cons: The food is mediocre and leaves something to be desired. I had the crazy tuna and the Buddha sushi -they both tasted similarly to me...like spicy mayo. Presentation seemed unimaginative, but at least there was an effort.   Would I come back?: yeah, I enjoyed the experience but I felt the menu could have been more differentiated. I would considered returning, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"asked if the salmon was wild and they told us it was.....but when it came out it was definitely farmed atlantic salmon! gross"}
{"text":"Visited Kanji last night with 4 fellow diners. Truth be told we had planned to visit neighbouring restaurant, Grand Electric, but the wait was too long. We saw newly re-opened Kanji on the corner so we figured 'can't go wrong with sushi'... We were mistaken.  I've been fortunate with my reviews to not have to post many, if any, negative reviews in my Yelp career, but Kanji is undeserving of more.  Kanji was about 30% full when we entered; there was no front of house presence so we waited 10 minutes and then asked a waiter if we could sit down. Water came out fairly quickly. The menu is pretty basic and uninspired as far as high-end sushi is concerned.  The place filled up to about 80% capacity pretty quickly and I don't think Kanji had ever been this full before. Their waitstaff and kitchens could not handle it.  We received our appetizers about 15 minutes after ordering and a couple sushi rolls along with them. We then waited over 45 minutes for our main courses, only to be told that they were still queued up in the kitchen and that they didn't know how long it will be. We took our bill, told the management of our dissatisfaction and went off into a city which thankfully has many more reliable options for food! (Yes, we were hungry!!)  From what we did eat: Miso Soup -- untraditional and mediocre (6/10) Gyoza - basic and what you'd expect from an all-you-can-eat place (5/10) Cucumber/Avocado roll - fell apart and I'd sooner recommend mall sushi (4/10) Crazy Tuna Roll - this roll was great! (8/10)  Drinks: specialty caesers (6/10) -- took 30 mins to arrive and way overpriced.   I don't recommend this place until they figure out how to properly service clientele. Food had promise, but for the price there is no way I would be back."}
{"text":"First and foremost, the owners of this restaurant would benefit from re-examining the delivery of service here.  It's clear that there are staffing issues, but more importantly the front of the house lacks basic restaurant service levels. Fundamentally, a restaurant should get this aspect of their business right, especially if their product is underwhelming, which leads me to their food.  The food at Kanji is mediocre at best.  When you factor in the price, you leave the restaurant feeling disappointed.  There wasn't a dish that was offensively bad, but there was nothing that we had that made me want to come back for more.  There are far better options in the city for much better value.  I would not recommend this restaurant and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is severely understaffed. Our server rarely came by, and the food came out very very slowly.  In general, the food was decent (not great) with the exception of the beef ribs, which my companions said were way too tough to chew through.  Even though they re-made it for us, the 2nd attempt wasn't any better.  Way too expensive for the quality we received."}
{"text":"Great place! Best sushi in Toronto and a really good service. The crazy tuna roll is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place looks like it has amazing food but at high prices. It does have great food but prices are more than reasonable for the quality.  There was a group of us all of us were more than impressed with the staff, ambiance, and the great food. We never had sushi like this.  Started off with crunchy taco sushi which was absolutely amazing and like nothing we've tried. Next was the Crab meat salad which was very distinct and flavourful. My main was the highly recommended (by staff), Crazy Tuna, it was pretty crazy and different. Oh and you have to try the Green Tea Tiramisu. MMMMmm so good.  This place has a nice vibe, spacious seating, and high end restaurant quality presentation but the prices are very reasonable. Will definitively coming back and recommending it to friends."}
{"text":"Don't expect traditional Japanese fare or decor.  A twist on Japanese food with obnoxiously loud music, dark lighting and high prices - just because.  We tried the crazy tuna, treasure island, edame, gyoza, 2 diff rolls and some sake. It wasn't bad, but just not good enough to come back again."}
{"text":"I don't understand why on a Friday night at 730pm they do not open up the full dinning area.  Instead I'm forced to sit in front of the entry door where I am freezing.  They see me with my jacket on, make it comfortable for your clients! 20 mins later, they finally listen to my complaint and let me change seats.  Food is okay.  Still won't come back."}
{"text":"Not your typical sushi place. As my girlfriend said - if your looking for a great restaurant this is it. If you want a traditional sushi vibe keep walking. Just about setting expectations.   Food is excellent. Agreed with the reviewers that the Crazy Tuna and Miso Soup were all fantastic. But we actually enjoyed the Buddha roll the most. Dynamite roll was also very good. The hardest part is choosing what to eat. It all looks great.   Overall a fantastic restaurant with a great casual yet modern vibe. Just don't expect bamboo dividers as part of the decor!"}
{"text":"Beware of the mirrors - they're confusing.  I came to Kanji on a tuesday night around 7 and it was pleasantly busy for Parkdale.  Our order consisted of Miso soup, gyoza, tempura, green dragon roll, crazy tuna roll, tuna tartare, and green tea tiramisu. For two people our bill came up to $120.00 with tax and tip. Its good food, but I don't understand previous reviews about how its priced reasonably. If i wanted 'reasonably priced' sushi I would go to the Bloor street mecca and eat all of the above for $14.00.  With that said a lot more labour and preparation goes into Kanji's product. You wont find browning avocado wedged in your california roll, and you probably wont get food poisoning from some slab of rancid sake sashimi. However, out of everything I tried, their signature crazy tuna roll was the only item which excused the sushi price hike. The atmospheres a lot of fun, and they have an eclectic sake selection, along with an interesting mix drink menu.  It was an enjoyable experience, would recommend giving it a try if you consider yourself a sushi conosur. Just dont order in from them every night to feed your family of 12 as you may personally be responsible for Canada's next recession"}
{"text":"Sushi lovers rejoice! Kanji delivers a delicious innovative sushi menu that is fairly priced. As a former Vancouverite I nearly swore off Toronto sushi which was either over priced or terrible quality or both. After going to Kanji I'm willing to say it's quality, presentation and flavor put it on par with some of my favorite spots in Vancouver.  The taste and presentation of each dish delivers real value while the relaxed and beautiful space bring home the experience.   Kanji loses a star because at times service can be slow but the meal and drinks are worth the wait. I'd love to see the restaurant figure out its staffing so that there are less complaints. Still, with any new spot a little inconsistency can be expected.   Things you must try:: Miso soup- a tasty miso base with vegetables and crunchy cracker sticks  The Crazy Tuna roll- I can't say enough about the dynamic flavor and interesting texture of this roll. It is to die for. Black sesame deep fried ice cream- I normally would go for the green tea but the black sesame is out of this world, it tastes a little like a light peanut butter with a delicious crispy crust. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Food was great but experienced ruined by horrible service. Some of the worst I've had. Host didn't greet us for 5-10 minutes. Waiter was very unhelpful unorganized and rude. Hair in the gyoza. Had to ask to get the table cleared between courses. Poor knowledge of dishes and menu. We're not given water refills. When water was refilled it went into a  cup of beer. Brought the bill in the middle of the meal without asking how everything was or if we would like dessert. When asked what the black sesame ice cream was like, the waiter replied \"it's like black sesame.\" It took 3 hours to complete our meal. Luckily we enjoyed the food and the company."}
{"text":"Tried this place out with a date recently.    The place looks and feels expensive, the food however is quite reasonably priced = 1 star!  We arrived late on a Saturday night, with no reservation...they didn't have a table available as it was packed, but the hostess offered us a seat near the bar area.  We ordered a drink and by the time our drinks arrived, the hostess came by to let us know that someone had canceled their reservation and that she had a table for us. + 1 more star!  We ordered 4 different dishes and they arrived quickly.  The service was surprisingly fast given how packed the place was, 1 more star!  The 4 items we ordered (Crazy Tuna Roll, Dragon Roll, Spicy Tuna - with jalpeno, and one more dish that I cannot recall) were not only beautifully presented, but the food was quite possibly some of the best sushi I've had in Toronto.  1 more star!  The music and atmosphere was very chill, and though there were a lot of people there and the DJ was spinning some great music, we were still able to carry on a conversation without having to shout.  So, one final star for that!"}
{"text":"Best miso ever! Everything else was pretty good too. Smaller menu and food was a little slow but good overall, I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Kanji has just reopened in Parkdale and has taken up the mantle of the only sushi in the neighbourhood.  The food is incredibly expensive for what your receiving and the service really, REALLY sucks.  When they're not trying to sucker you into ordering more food or over priced cocktails they seem to think that the best method to keep you ordering is to ignore you - we asked for the bill and after 30 minutes of waiting and a conversation with the floor manager were finally given an opportunity to pay.  Our waiter then presented us with a lame excuse about how the place was so busy he couldn't make it over to our table and yet there are over 5 waiters on the floor on a Tuesday.    The food was fairly mediocre, we ordered a Boston roll, a veggie plate and a salmon selected plate and it was all quite good but nothing to get excited about - its food which is served with a myriad of pretty but un edible and thus useless garnish. We also ordered two cocktails - my companions drink was lovely and lemony which complimented the sake nicely, mine was what appeared to be an old fashoned made with sake instead of bourbon and no sugar - which gave it a kind of rotten taste that reminded me a little bit of steaming compost.   I suspect It would have been easier to order these drinks or any drinks at all for that matter if our waiter had actually given us a drinks menu rather than saying in a barely audible voice what of the two cocktails were selling well.     Bottom line: Food okay, service unforgivably awful."}
{"text":"The soft shell crab appetizer disappointed in the flavour department, although deep fried anything is tasty.   The sashimi platter was fresh, well presented and a good value for the fish quality. The platter came with Salmon, red tuna, yellowtail, markeral and white fish. All well presented and delicious tasting.  The spicy salmon roll pieces were crispy, melt in your mouth bite size glories.  And finally the Estascy roll was average, not taste bud explosion as the previous plates.  Overall a great sushi experience. Tax and Tip for two: $100  The soft shell crab appetizer disappointed in the flavour department, although deep fried anything is tasty.

{"text":"If you had asked me before going how I'd feel about a large sushi place in Parkdale that kind of turns into a lounge with multiple bars as the night progresses, I'd tell you that sounded like my nightmare. Boy was I wrong. I Heart Kanji and so will you!  They're nice if you're a walk-in even though they get slammed on the weekends. They're really great about sending you to the bar area for one of their artisan cocktails, and seating you promptly for dinner. Their food price point is low considering how fresh their rolls are, and their tempura plates are large and in charge.   Don't let their sleek lounge-y-ness intimidate you, this is a great venue with an authentic sushi/Izakaya menu and once you're full... why not stay for a drink or two? The DJ is playing fun yet not intrusive tunes on the weekends. Word.   Kan I get some more Kanji? Yes please!   PEPPER POINTS for being so great with large groups. A splendid place for a celebration of 10 or so!"}
