{"text":"I love this place!  The food is good and such a great selection unlike other buffet. This is my first choice buffet off-strip."}
{"text":"Fantastic buffet for brunch. All the possible breakfast fare from eggs benedict, porridge,  biscuits and gravy, fresh fruits, yogurts,  peppers, Mexican and Asian and Italian assorted dishes. Plateful of bacon tops it off.  If room, have dessert, too. Peach cobbler with bread pudding icing tastes great. Good value for $9.99."}
{"text":"The Aliante has changed hands and the buffet is no longer managed by the Station chain and has changed it's name from 'Feast' to 'Medley'.  Definitely a change for the better!!  We tried the old Station buffet a couple times and decided not to go back.  The fall in the quality and selection in the offerings at the Cannery prompted us to try Aliante again.  Excellent quality, lunch is only $7.95 (!) and vast selection including a couple carving stations and a barbecue station that would be acceptable in a BBQ joint.  We always liked the look of the Aliante, now their food measures up, Try it!"}
{"text":"My most recent trip here was at the beginning of July for my dad's birthday. My little sister and I were treating my dad to dinner at the buffet, a movie and we even split the cost of a gift for my dad. This is not the first time I have been to this buffet, and it isn't too bad. It may not be the best buffet in the world but if you go with 5 or less people you have a higher chance of finding a table. Oh, make sure you have your players card on you so that you can take advantage of the discounts to get inside. Honestly, I would come back here again. Mostly because it is close to where I live. They were well staffed and tried to get everyone seated as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Went for Easter brunch after church. Was really good lots of selections. Line Moved pretty quickly. Our server was Laurie she Was very personable ."}
{"text":"Horrible buffet and customer service! They charge a 2 year old child who doesn't eat crab $30, which is ridiculous. The quality of the food has gone down, no gelato."}
{"text":"I love this buffet, most of the food is delicious but the sushi is a DISAPPOINTMENT. The ice cream  is delicious! I love it! So is the fresh bread! Also a big pick of fruitsIt's an ok place to spend time with your family I go there often and I see a LINE of people, ( it goes by fast ). This is a good place and depending on your taste you might like it! Altogether 85% good (4 )"}
{"text":"If you have to wait in front of a hostess for more then 20 minutes and 40 minutes in line without any acknowledgment from the hostess then that's when you make sure you take that place of your list. Complaining to a lady manager who ignores the fact of a senior and 3 kids in line is morally unfair.  Red rock casino sure will never again have my business."}
{"text":"If you are planning on eating at the Feast Buffet and have a family with children reconsider and go somewhere else.  They are charging FULL PRICE for TWO year old children.  How much is a Two year old going to eat?  Take your money somewhere else that will appreciate your business and not rip you off.  That is ridiculous. We walked away."}
{"text":"Red Rock Hotel was one of my favorite local hotel casinos to visit. The buffet here is delicious compared to the other Station Casinos I've been to.  They have a wide verity of food and desserts you can choose from. It's beautifully located in Summerlin, where it's classy and conveniently located near the Downtown Summerlin Shopping Center where I enjoyed strolling after an awesome meal at the Feast Buffet. I highly recommend visiting Red Rock Hotel and Casino if you're tired of being on The Strip!"}
{"text":"Beastly.  When the only edible morsels at the buffet are the cornbread, egg drop soup and the mussels (I know...who would risk shellfish when everything else was so awful) something is very very wrong.  The BBQ pork was so tough if fired from a slingshot it could have downed a mastodon.  Not since high school was a dissection so difficult as the one I performed on the sweet and sour chicken, looking for chicken.  It was missing.  The rare roast beef appeared to be painted pink.  And the hot dogs?  Ha ha ha.  Gray, floating in putrid water.  Salad was wilted and brown.  Never to return."}
{"text":"I have been to Sunset Station, Red Rock Casino, Palace Station, Boulder Station casino and I have to say Sunset Station has the best buffet of them all. It has a lot more selections for a vegan like myself. The Mongolian bbq is great. The person who makes the Mongolian bbq knows how to keep the veggies crisp and good. The salad bar is great. They have more fruits for me. It is clean and the service it good. One thing I do not like is that the buffet is not enclosed so if you sit close to the slot machines even if you are inside the resto you can still smell the cigarette smoke from the casino, yuck! Another thing that I like is that if you sign up for your Preferred card you get you meals at a discount. Lunch buffet for $6.99 and dinner/brunch for $9.99. What a steal! Be ready to line up during the weekends because it is busy! Eat during the week and you get better service."}
{"text":"A very solid buffet. That's it though . Solid is as far as it goes. The waiters and front desk associates are always helpful and you can't beat the 7.99 price if you join their rewards club. The food is decent nothing atrocious and nothing spectacular. The food is sometimes left out for too long but I'm sure that has to do with it being a slower buffet and also being lower budget. They have live chefs (I recommend having them make you a fresh pasta as they actually come out delicious and seem the best way to enjoy a fresher meal and get the most bang for your buck. (I got a pesto penne with sundried tomato and chicken and it was amazing.)"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for dinner during the holidays.  The price was good and the the quality of the food was not bad.  There were not too many choices, but you get what we pay for.  I liked the relaxed atmosphere in this buffet compared to the busy and established ones at the big strip hotels.  I would recommend this buffet to anyone.  Just remember the food is basic, but it is pretty good."}
{"text":"Good choices.   -clam chowder -salad bar -ice cream station  Everything else is mediocre and really don't go for seconds on anything.   It is worth the 10 dollars because it is so cheap and in the morning it is cheaper. My dad thought it was okay but was sick from the other food selections next day which are produced like slop for pigs.  Literally.  Not much care put into dishes like chicken etc but then again it is only 10 dollars. In this case you get what you pay for.  I would go back but would only eat the salad, soup and ice cream."}
{"text":"If the Fiesta and Red Rock had a child, Boulder station would be that child. Casino aside, wanted to check out the buffet here for lunch. The food was slightly more salty for my tastes (kung-pao chicken). I'm a large fan of pizza but each different piece was lacking in terms of taste. I did enjoy some dishes I never seen at any other Station casino (egg foo young, pork chops with saurkraut). They even had little M&M cookies which reminded me of childhood. Service and decorum was great. For a place that's out of the way I'm more of a fan for the Texas Station."}
{"text":"Beef brisket. BBQ ribs. Since they added these two items late last year this buffet has been amazing. The el pastor tacos arn't much to boast about but worth a try. Make sure to check them out after 4pm though for dinner when they start serving them. Other mentionables there is their pulled pork and bread pudding. Delicious and filling if you're on a budget. Also helps from burning a hole in your wallet."}
{"text":"The buffet is one of the cheapest you are going to find here, but it's one of the worst buffets in Las Vegas. I don't know how people even give this place a 5 star rating, and I'm thinking some of these reviews are fake. They have the most basic food you can find - hard shell tacos, hamburger, spaghetti, pizza, cheap ham, and water down ice cream."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend definitely returning! Great service great food variety very inexpensive"}
{"text":"The Aliante Feast Buffet is ok. Nothing there is spectacular or interestingly different, but I have never left feeling hungry. I've eaten all the buffets before, but we typically go for lunch every couple months when I have the spare points. I'm not certain I would ever pay full price for the food, as you can get a better buffet downtown at Main Street, where the food seems a bit fresher.  The desserts are probably my favorite part. They have a variety of pies, as well as mini desserts  Overall, if you are already in the area, it's fine, but don't go out of your way to visit this buffet, as you can get the same thing at whichever Station casino is closest."}
{"text":"Tried a few times to come back. Unless you have 2 hours to kill to wait in line, don't bother. Even on weekdays the line is painfully slow and long."}
{"text":"1st time at Feast Buffet and was very surprised , walk in to the Casino no stale cigarette smoke smell. Bo obnoxious elevator music that makes one angry listening to it. The food was fresh, hot, and tasty no dried out meats or sausages and could not believe the pricing $5.99 with players card. To quote the terminator I Well Be Back."}
{"text":"Last week we went to eat at the feast at green valley ranch, my girlfriend , myself an both kids got so sick after eating there..we went around 5 in the evening an we all woke up early morning, vomiting non stop. We have ate there a lot in the past with no problems. But after the last time I'll never eat there again. After I was feeling better I emailed green valley ranch. An have still not heard a word back from them, that was my favorite casino in town.  But it shows they really don't care at all about there customers. I'm debating on ever going back there. Thanks, I just wanted to put this out there  D."}
{"text":"A buffet should serve breakfast till noon. 11 is not lunch. Especially if you had fun last night lol.  They need new highchairs since most of them are broken"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my family because my uncle said it was good. Line was long but arnt all buffet lines long in vegas? We came here during breakfast and im not much of a breakfast fan so it wasnt really good for me, although they were putting out lunch since i guess it was lunch time also. The breakfast was alright they got a little stuff the usual. They had desserts which were my fav and i especially loved the cinnamon or were they sugar cookies? nonetheless they were the best part of my meal! Haha i wanted to take some back with me but they didnt have a lot left!   I would come back here though for dinner and see how it is!"}
{"text":"Attitude sucks here!  Some people don't deserve jobs working with public. Food was okay."}
{"text":"At $15 I still felt cheated. Struggled to fill my plate up once with something appetizing, seriously one of the worst, cheapest looking spreads i've seen, dennys is better, not kidding."}
{"text":"I can't let this experience go, even though it happened a few weeks ago. The dessert section at the Sunset has always been bad, but it went from bad to worst ever. I asked for a piece of peach pie. The very elderly lady behind the counter handed me a meager crappy piece, but I took it and went back to my table. I then noticed a human hair right in the middle of the pie. I took the pie back to the dessert counter and handed it back to the old lady and said that it had a hair on it. She leaned forward for a look with her mouth drooping wide open way over the piece of pie. She said \"where?\" Meaning where is the hair. I didn't even bother to answer, just said \"its not mine.\" She said \"its not mine,\" and the big guy spooning the ice cream said \"its not mine.\" I just walked off. Wouldn't a trained person have said, Oh, I'm so sorry about that, I'll get you another piece? Ugghhh The rest of the line was almost as bad. Crust on the pudding, macaroni, spinach on salad bar was bruised and wilted. We've eaten at this buffet dozens of times, but we won't be going back. They need a new food manager and some staff training."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is great, lots of choices of course, also several stations where they make omelettes, pasta to order etc. Definitely have a mimosa or two they were very good. Attentive and friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"Definitely the bang for buck value of Las Vegas. It seems like most of the buffets are terribly expensive, or total dumps. This place is generally reasonably priced, maybe a tad expensive on weekends but nowhere near what you pay on the strip, but I can't get over how clean it is! Yes, you won't find fancy seafood, but what they do have won't make you sick, and generally tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"Food was very good for what we paid, $37 for 5 people. Selection was good and the service as well. Will definitely come back on future visits to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I lived in Summerlin until recently, and my family loved to eat at this buffet. Price- Great Atmosphere- Good Food- Very Good Waitresses- very friendly"}
{"text":"it has everything you expect. Nothing that stands out. I liked the meats at the carving stations, they seem fresh and tender. Everything is a bit too salty for my taste. Don't order mixed drinks, for $3 it seems a bargain, but they were awful. gelato was smooth, cream spinach was awful, like they used cream cheese. I would like some new american cuisine like quinoa and other salad options, but oh well. With the players card you save $5, so it might be worth the gut busting."}
{"text":"The selection for the dinner buffet was good.  It included Italian, Mexican, Asian, American, dessert & salad stations. Your typical carving station.  Can't beat $9.99 dinner buffet (make sure you sign up for the players card to get discount)   Only complain is our server was a bit rude & seemed bothered with our party."}
{"text":"A good buffet with a little better than average food. A wide selection sure to please most everyone. I've eaten at a lot of buffets in Vegas but we somehow wind up going back here. The prime rib is the best buffet prime rib I've ever had. It rivals that of some finer Prime Rib establishments. The crab legs are hit and miss. Sometimes they are really good and sometimes I don't go back for seconds. I love the bread pudding here, it's some of the best I've had anywhere. Overall it's a good one and it's 24.99 on Fri night w/player's card and 17.99 on Sat. night."}
{"text":"No it is not the best in LV.  But I was pleasantly suprised for 10 dollars!  The food was fresh, everything was delicious. Nothing was old or cold or weird and the salad bar did not taste like the lettuce came out of a bag. Everyone here was very friendly and pleasant and for a buffet it was decorated kinda classy!"}
{"text":"Went here a couple weeks ago on a Saturday with a group of 18. Given the small seating space this buffet had, we were seated after 20 mins or so.. not bad. And we were all able to sit together. In our group their were a variety of ages & preferences so this buffet was perfect.. & they did things fresh.. I stuck around the salad bar & fruit..lol. But they have a burger bar where they make your burger cooked to order with any toppings.. Also a fajita station where they will make you fresh fajitas.. and last but not least a icecream staion where they will make you shakes & sundaes :) This buffet is also very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Last minute plans for a buffet.. Yea lets go.  I been here for brunch and dinner a few times with family and friends. I like it, nothing amazing but I like that everything I try doesn't disappoint. They have shrimp and a pasta bar where they cook your pasta to order. Everything I try taste fresh, the buffet and dining area is clean and comfortable atmosphere. Paid $10 for a bottle of wine and I was happy."}
{"text":"I am going to give a 1 star rating because the Roast Beef is overcooked and the meat is chewy. My experience at the Feast Buffet is less then perfect. Visited on 11/15/2013"}
{"text":"Never have I ever gone to a place paid my money then ask for it back!! The food in this place is so bad I wanted it back. Ok first of all while waiting in line I was looking around and was liking the decor and the seating arrangements the red rock has got to be the best casino for foot traffic. But the people they hire to prepare the food needs improvement. Let's start with the Asian section think of the worst Asian buffet place you have been to. It's still better the stuff they try to call Asian food here. (I'm not the only one who thinks so cause when I sat down to try it my self an Asian couple had left their plates full of the food from the Asian) Now the American food they had macaroni and cheese that I regretted getting the butterfly shrimp they had was ok needed a little ingredient known as salt. Everything their could have used some salt. There was no flavor in anything other than the soft serve ice cream I got. They don't even know how to make Italian food it's really disappointing. I wouldn't give it any stars but the decor and atmosphere give it one star. Red Rock employees if your reading this you need somebody to come and show the people in the Feast how to cook because what they are doing now is insulting. Just because it is a buffet doesn't mean putting out crap is acceptable."}
{"text":"Feast buffets is taking Las Vegas by storm! They r getting so much better each time I m here. And I heard they r also taking over the Palm Casino n is remodeling the Palace Station. Can't wait to try the Feast buffet at the Palm when they finish the renovation. Anyway, the Feast at Palace Starion is stil one of my favorite! There is never a wait. Even though it is one of the smallest Feast buffet in the valley. But it is sufficient to keep U full n satisfy!"}
{"text":"Feast Buffets never ceased to amaze me! Their buffets r some of the most value n honest deal u will ever find in Vegas! Also their fresh order omelette n pasta stations are already worth the ticket price! Red Rock's Feast Buffet is a little above the rest for its sophisticated dining space n greater selections of dishes. And they r all well n carefully prepare for! I usually prefer to go to the one at Palace Station for its lesser crowd n simplistic choices but good selection like the Egg Foo Young n Burger/Steak grill! Now that I had a taste of the Feast at Red Rock! I will make this my permanent place to entertain out of town guests n families!"}
{"text":"This Feast is a bit better than the one at Boulder. But it is no Feast like Red Rock. Customer service is efficient.  My table was constantly check upon. Just wish the food could be better. Had such high expectation before coming here. Still a good n affordable buffet if ever in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, great food, cajun schrimp is deluctable!  Italian, just couldn't stop eating it.   Mongolian,  BOMB! Authentic mexican.. not enough room for desert, bummer."}
{"text":"Good selection, great staff, clean, nice atmosphere, and CHEAP!  Best buffet deal in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food selection for the price. Very happy with value, cleanliness, friendly service, discount option, and drinks included :)"}
{"text":"This review is based on the Friday night seafood buffet. I went last night and paid $30 with tax to get in. Pricey, I know. I went straight for the crab legs, just like everybody else. I piled on about 5-6 sections and tried to chow down. They must have a gotten a great deal on these crab legs because I was barely able to get anything out of them. When I did get some crab meat it was falling apart and stringy. It's a shame these crabs gave their lives to have most of their meat thrown away. I moved onto the muscles and clams, thinking they had to be better. Now, I know all of these things come from the sea, but they were the fishiest tasting specimens I've ever had. Again, a waste of a living organism. Finally, I gave the fruit a shot. That was the only thing I ate all of. My advice is to go to the oyster bar and pay $32 for the 1.5 pounds of crab legs where you can actually get some quality meat out of them."}
{"text":"Pretty good value...this place is what one would think of as true, classic buffet. No gimmicks."}
{"text":"Great Customer Service. Good food, a lot of Variety of foods at this buffet. Pineapple juice is a must. Unl mimosas is also great for brunch. I recommend this place to all you Foodies out there!"}
{"text":"The good:  cheap, good selection of food, great dessert, you can eat as much as you want.  The bad: rude service from start to finish, hosts are super rude act like you should tip them, then when they seat you they act irritable.  Manager Mary Anne is by far the most unprofessional manager I've ever came across.    The ugly: Yesterday night saw a chef preparing fajitas while chomping down on some food.  Absolutely disgusting and unsanitary.  Not to mention health department violation.    I will be back because of the strawberry cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Last night, my mom decided to take us to the Green Valley Feast Around the World Buffet. She said it's good so we decided to give it a go. Since it was a Saturday night it cost $21.99 per adult. The difference being that it had \"Surf & Turf.\"   As with all Vegas style buffets there are different stations dedicated to different ethnic categories of food. There was a Chinese station, a Mongolian station, a Mexican station, an Italian station, a carving station, a salad bar, and a dessert bar. Perhaps there were other stations that I can't really remember at this moment.   I thought the food was alright. It definitely wasn't spectacular, but then again no buffet is. I'm not a buffet snob, but being that my dad used to own several restaurants (most of them being buffets) and me even working at two of them I believe I have the background and experience to say what's good and what's not.   They had crab legs but there was a pretty big crowd around it so I didn't even bother. Why wait in line to get some skimpy legs when I didn't even bother eating it at my dad's restaurants, ever? I can even eat King crab legs at home several times throughout the year. The carne deshebrada was way too salty. Salty to the point where I had to toss it out. The oysters were just whatever. Most of them were small and lacked the creaminess that I desired. Believe me, I love oysters but these weren't that great. The prime rib wasn't bad and neither was the cheese pizza. I was hoping that they would have creme brulee since that's the only dessert I like. However, they didn't. They had a pretty good selection of other stuff including bread pudding, cookies, cupcakes (miniature ones), pies, etc. Nothing I desired in the least but my sister got a plate of assorted desserts and I ended up eating the bread pudding. It was rather good.   I decided to get a plate of Mongolian noodles. I loaded it with mushrooms, pineapples, spinach, ginger, and chili sauce. They had beef, chicken, pork, and seafood to choose from. I would have preferred lamb but since they didn't offer it I chose beef. The cook gave me so much meat that half of the plate consisted of beef and the other half noodles. It was even too much meat for me and I'm a meat person.   Overall the experience was alright. The one thing that really sucked is that they don't have Coke products but instead have gross Pepsi products. I went with an unsweetened iced tea instead."}
{"text":"Love this place great food love the omelets pastas with shrimp and is only $6.00 then $9.00 for lunch with the player card me and my family always come here the waiters are really nice everyone is excellent I would give 100 stars but I could only give 5"}
{"text":"Good selection, but the food was rather boring. Ate here once. Won't go back. Go to the food court or tgi Friday's instead"}
{"text":"If you like cafeteria food, this will be a great place for you. The waiters and waitress are very friendly but with that said. The food just straight sucks. The choices for a buffet are limited and it looks unappetizing . Don't be fooled by the cheap price . You definitely get what you pay for. I won't ever eat here again. Spend a  few more dollars and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good thing I only paid 8 bucks for this buffet.  For the same price you should go to the Santa Fe Station buffet. WAY BETTER!! The Mexican fare is better here though still a smaller selection than Santa Fe. Asian is not good here. Dessert bar very lacking I don't think the desserts are even made here since I can see a bunch of bakery boxes and aluminum pie tins around.  Definitely going back to Santa Fe for the buffet from now on."}
{"text":"By far one of if not the best buffet in nevada as far as value goes .. awesome omelette station .. very good chinese mexican and italian food and delicious deserts all at an affordable price .. i would recommend the weekdays to avoid the lines"}
{"text":"Whenever we go to Las Vegas, we always try to eat at the GVR Feast Buffet, it's always been a great deal for the price.  Just visited again last night (saturday night surf and turf), and it was even better than ever!  They had a tenderloin roast that was perfectly cooked, the crab legs were as good as ever, the salmon was delicious, and they also had seabas that was outstanding.  The also have a mongolian grill which is great, but I was way too full this time to make anything.  Overall, for around $20 on a Saturday night, I don't know of a better buffet in the Las Vegas area!"}
{"text":"Never Ever Ever Come Here....If You Do It At Your Own Risk ....  I normally come here to gamble and I have eaten at Fat Burger which pretty Good, but the Buffet was awful. The food servers that should be cleaning the stations and putting out hot and ready meals, where completely rude. I asked if she can refill the soup at the international station because it was only water left and she stated that she wouldn't do that until it was completely gone...  Everything from the fried rice (which u can still see where they mixed the white rice and soy sauce) to the deserts....After eating here i felt completely sick and I hadn't eaten anything else that whole day ...i went to the hospital after vomiting and constant trips to the restroom to find out I had food poisoning stay clear from this place ....  Oh my server Rosa was nice ...but other than that you are on your own .."}
{"text":"This is the most reasonable well-done buffet in Vegas. Everything is fresh and they strive hard to make it unique and not just run of the mill. From raspberry vinaigrette beets, cous-cous feta salad, to sweet potato salad they push there salad bar into  interesting. They  even had German selections for Octoberfest.! The prime rib is very nicely done(with a selection of rare to well) and you can't beat it for the money. The ribs/chicken bbq items have a very nice rub and smoky flavor and are worth a try. The pies are from a local baker and very good. wait staff and decor very nice, clean and well run!"}
{"text":"Food sits out for too long, everything I tasted was either dry or tasted old. Worst buffet of Las Vegas. The only thing I really appreciated was all you can drink wine and beer they offered for an extra $6.99."}
{"text":"Went here w/parents for lunch after son's graduation.  Only vegan food at lunch is the mushy fruit (watermelon and canteloupe).  Salad bar is pathetic.  3 choices of plain veggies (carrots etc).  Most of the offerings were premade salads like coleslaw etc.  Pasta has egg in it.  Rice made with meat broth.  And so on. I highly doubt dinner would be any different.    Hour wait in line, 30 minute wait for table - couldn't eat a thing.  $15 for a plate of mushy fruit and dry salad.  Now I remember why I only eat at the Wynn's buffet."}
{"text":"The manager is Very, very rude and unhelpful!!! Very bad experience. And about quality of food, VERY mediocre for the price. Never again! I'm giving 1 star because I can't give 0!!!!"}
{"text":"Same ol' Station Casino buffet if you consider price and selection.   I like gathering a plate full of cold shrimp, garlic, onions, green onions and having them saute it with their red chili paste. These simple ingredients along with their seasoned grill makes it tasty and soooo good."}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's wedding reception.... Food was standard buffet good. Nothing that blew me away. I liked the mongolian bbq option the best because it was the freshest. Gelato station was bomb...Not sure what the prices were since we didn't pay...   Desserts, Salads, \"American\"..\"Italian\"... \"Asian\"... All your standards.. pizza, fried chicken, mac n cheese... spaghetti meatballs, chicken alfredo, garlic bread... orange chicken, spring rolls, white rice, fried rice, spicy beef, different veggies at each station.. carving station with turkey & prime rib... as for the desserts they had different cakes & pies.. I only had the gelato & a bite of cheescake which was good...    Overall, would I leave the strip and eat here again? Probably Not. Would I ever stay at the Green Valley Ranch? In the summer very possible..."}
{"text":"This place is a great value. So many options...Asian, Italian, American, Mexican, and dessert. The pizza is great, salad bar is pretty good, and the dessert bar is excellent. My favorite was the cappuccino gelato. The service is also consistently good. For 10 bucks, this is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"The buffet is decently priced.  There is a great selection of foods, but the quality was a-okay.  The sushi section only had a few types of sushi.  The rice was pressed too firm and just fell apart after the first bite.  We were really looking forward to the desserts section, but it was a disappointment.  The gelato was almost melted by the time I ate it.  After eating at the buffet two days straight, we had to pass the next day."}
{"text":"Not only for locals. The Feast Buffet in the Vegas area has been the best buffet I've had   In this city. For price, service, and quality of food.   I visited the green valley buffet this Christmas Eve with my wife. Arrived about 7 pm for dinner. The line was not long at all. If you go on the strip, you are waiting for an hour. The Christmas Eve dinner price was about $20 per person that night. We actually paid $10 per because we got a 2-4-1 coupon in the mail for being a club member. Which I suggest guest get for the discounted prices and deals onfood and play at any stations casinos.    After paying we were seated right away. The table was not on level ground but I fixed that with the extra napkins I got. They served our drinks before we got back from the bar and was on there best service refilling drinks and clearing our plates. Its the reason We come back over and over again. I can say so much about the food good and bad but that would be a long list. The price you pay for the quality of food you get surpasses any bad.The soft serve ice cream is my favorite with all feast buffets because it's not yogurt. Mmm and they let me walk out with a cone for on the go. Thank you for the experiences."}
{"text":"Lunch was amazing. Great service. You can make your own hamburger I have never been to a buffet that offers that. I recommend it"}
{"text":"Of all the Station Casino Buffets this is by far the best. While no one likes to admit they like the buffets, I do. Not because I can gorge my myself but because I have a hard time making a decision on what I want when I go out. Here, I can get a bite of a few different things and I love it! And if you hate it? Don't eat it and go try something else.   The sushi station is usually really good, and I love the Mexican options. The dessert selections leave much to be desired. But maybe that's better for a fattie  like me. Ha.   Oops I meant foodie... Or did I?  The brunch is great, simply because who doesn't like bottomless mimosas? Happy Sunday!   I've eaten here quite a few times and I would come back. Of course I eat here free, so why wouldn't I?   If you're in the area, def give it a try. You'll surely find something you like."}
{"text":"The fried  was a little funky. There was no sushi The brownie with a splash of mint chip chocolate ice cream was delicious. The fresh made burgers were good. That was the highlight... Might as well of had gone to fatburger across the casino..."}
{"text":"We use to come here once a week three years ago but since the changed their menu things got worse here. The food quality got so bad that only go there twice a year now to see maybe something changed again. My wife convinced me to go  there last week.  Service: We got one of those small table for two. after serving the drinks, our server disappear. She never came back to take the plates. If I remember right it use to be her job.   The food: most of the items were over cooked to a degree that they were uneatable. The  roast has too mach liquid smoke in it that leave you with awful after taste for hours and the rest  of the food is just bland. The only thing I somewhat enjoyed was the wonton soup and an egg-roll."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch the other day and it was a pretty decent meal. Like most buffets, there were hits and misses.    For most people, the brunch buffet would be a great value.  Cocktail shrimp, fried shrimp, sushi, multiple carving stations, and 2 glasses of champagne for $15 (with boarding pass).  For a vegetarian like me, buffets are never a good deal.  But compared to other buffets, there was a good selection and I left feeling full.  Potato pancakes, french toast, green beans, mac n' cheese, a good salad bar, and even (not so good) tofu veggie stir fry.  I was also (super) excited to have (a lot of) cucumber sushi rolls.  Service was great, the place is clean, and the food turns around quickly so it's fresh.  There is a ginormous line to get in, however.... you will get stuck behind families of 9+ people trying to get a table.  Don't get there when you're starving or you may pass out before you are seated."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. They have a nice variety of food, it's all cooked well. For the price of 7.99  a person and the fact they serve breakfast until 11am.. it's a pretty great deal."}
{"text":"Feast Buffet is good for the price with a Rewards Card. Although if they had a better selection of food it would make it all the better. I recommend their Salad first and for most, Macoronni and cheese, Pizza, and last but not least their Meatballs. And of course their deserts!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night. Just like any other local casinos buffet. The one thing that was different was they had a hawaiian night. So there was a full pig on hand, roasted I think. Decent kalua pig with the right dipping sauces. Deserts were ok, again nothing special just like anywhere else. Our server was great though. Forgot her name but our drinks always stayed filled and empty plates were taking off the table right away. Overall food, ok. Service good."}
{"text":"Well the selections for our breakfast were great, our server was fast and friendly. And where else are you going to get a breakfast for $4.99. However, my husband and I both got salad's as well and half way through his salad, little bugs were coming out of his salad. I freaked out and asked one of the servers to take the plate, she said she would tell the manager, It took about 10 minutes for a manager to get to our table, and she says sorry can i make you another salad. Are you kidding me. Who wants to eat here when bugs are in your food. So disgusting. Due, to this we will not be back.  The reason they get one star is because of how long it took to respond to the situation, and the fact there were bugs in the food. YUCK"}
{"text":"Great price Is the reason I give this 4 stars. Depends on your luck if you  get a good waiter/waitress. food has many options. Overall pretty good."}
{"text":"I come here for two reasons a.) to redeem my rewards b.)it's cheap. They could add more variety to their Sushi bar. I love the Salad bar. Soups are forgettable. The Flan in the dessert section and sesame balls in the Asian section, ROCK. Free champagne,  free refills. Definitely Bang for the Buck."}
{"text":"Great omelette! Bacon done just right. I have eaten at a lot of buffets in town. Everything came together here today. It was best experience in long time at buffet. This is legit. I wasn't riding a high coming off the tables or anything...LOL"}
{"text":"For the amazing price and the variety of food its not that bad. Some taste authentic and others almost hit the spot. But overall very good and full tummy!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving \"The Feast\" Five stars for VALUE!  If you go late in the afternoon you can slip in the Prime Rib, which comes with DINNER.  If you go for DINNER that one plate of Prime Rib alone is worth $16.99 at wholesale prices, and $30.00 - $60.00 at Restaurant prices.  YES, their Prime Rib is of the highest quality -- as of this writing.  Prime Rib is generally NOT available for LUNCH, but they may include it, usually right after a Holiday or major Vegas event.  Even without the Prime Rib, there is world class glazed Ham, Turkey, Pork Roast, Chicken, Ribs, Fish, Crawfish, generous regional and international MEAT dishes.  There is also an ASIAN fresh to order STIRFRY bar, wok artistry at it's finest.    What I miss: I have been coming here since Day #1 and some things have been cut back.   I wish they would bring back the array of fresh fruits, cold cuts, cheeses, kosher foods like mini bagels, pickled herring, salmon, lox ...  I hope they perk up the salad bar, and add a bit of elbow room at the dessert station.   Not that I'm complaining, the food here is always impeccably prepared. The kitchen staff is top notch!   Long story short, value and quality is what one finds at the Feast.  Get a Players Membership Card for added value, and avoid rush times. You can save an hour in line by going an hour after each set meal time.  Be sure to leave a tip for the attendants. at least $1.00 per person served. Little known Vegas fact is, tipping brings you Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Bleh.  So I had been to Aliante's buffet a few times before, but the last time I was there I would say was about a year ago.  In the past it had served its purpose: a cheap way to fill up on a weekend afternoon without having to stray too far from my house.  There were always enough vegetarian options to leave me full and tons of desserts to share with my husband.  This past weekend, however, showed me that this buffet had taken a big turn for the worse.  There were hardly any veg-friendly items, and what I could find was not good.  There were several occasions when I took one bite of something and then left the rest to sit on my plate.    The noticeable trend was that nothing was fresh or made from scratch.  The tomatoes in the marinated salad were soft and just a day shy needing to be thrown out.  The lettuce at the salad bar tasted like a sweaty foot.  I'm pretty sure the mac 'n cheese was made with Velveeta.  The hush puppies were completely dried out like they had been sitting under a heat lamp for 6 hours.  I looked at the different pastas and sauces and they appeared to have been sitting out for far too long, so I didn't even bother trying any of it out.  The vegetables they offered all looked like they had been frozen and then steamed into oblivion.  Again, I just didn't bother.  The chow mein was completely inedible.  I want to say they used spaghetti noodles (not positive, though) and the noodles were overcooked and just covered in a thick, nasty grease.  One bite and I was done.  The only things that were \"ok\" to me were the pizza, mashed potatoes, and desserts.    The buffet is only $7 for lunch, so I guess you get what you pay for.  A year or two ago, I'd walk away feeling full and thinking it was a good value despite the fact that as a vegetarian I can only eat a small portion of what they offer.  But after this fiasco, I will be spending my $7 elsewhere.  For all you non-vegetarians, I would say that $7 is still a really good deal....unless they managed to screw up every single item they offer.  Which at this point, I would believe to be completely possible."}
{"text":"This is my 1st time coming to this buffet! The service is great and the food is delicious. The sushi and fruits are always fresh. Loved the pistachio gelato that they offered, it was a nice way to end a stuffing meal. The buffet has a lot of different great options and offers an amazing price! Make sure to get a players boarding pass (it's free) for a discount. I will definitely come back!! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"At the time we went it was $8 each and it was actually pretty decent. Everything was fresh and hot and they had a good variety. We will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"My favorite so far of the Station buffets. Very reasonable mid week price ($14 or so), and I came with a buy one get one free. The selection was grand, and the food was fresh. For price and selection, you cant go wrong here."}
{"text":"This buffet advertises 2 free breakfast vouchers with each room.  My son and I waited in line for over 1 hour  for breakfast, the host tells us that we have to pay because breakfast ends at 11 am.  The restaurant manager, Jenn, refused to do anything to make the situation right, because breakfast ended 10 minutes earlier.  So, if you want free breakfast, make sure you arrive more than 60 minutes before you would like to eat."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were hungry and decided to try the buffet. We arrived and stayed in line for quite a while since they only had one credit card machine working. I recommend that you get a boarding pass before you get in line. Otherwise you will have to pay extra for the buffet or get out of line to sign up for one, not cool if you are starving...lol The food was great and the staff was friendly, the selection is what you would expect at a buffet. The best part was that when we went around 12:40pm the food was fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"decent food great prices if they had crab legs this place would get 4.5 stars the food is good quality the sides are delicious and everything looks fresh not like old sitting around buffet food"}
{"text":"I love this place because I can never chose what I want for breakfast. I always want a little of everything and I can get that here! I like everything I tasted and the service was great. The line is a problem, but if you have a club card you can cut the line and get a discount. My husband loves being able to make his breakfast into TexMex if he felt like it, and he said the have the BEST coffee."}
{"text":"Unlike other feast buffet, the one at Red Rock is a very good quality buffet with reasonable price, breakfast $6.99, lunch $8.99, dinner $13.99, prime rib dinner $16.99 if you show the preferred card to the cashier. You can obtain one for free.  Breakfast was good. Very standard, nothing was too special but they have 2 stations that you can order your own omelette.   I like the Asian and BBQ stations at lunch. Cookies and pies were good, but the gelato was a bummer..  Dinner is almost the same as lunch. I have never tried the prime rib dinner as I am favor in lawry's. Maybe I will give it a try someday."}
{"text":"Attempted to make it for breakfast. Got in line 45 minutes before breakfast was over and didnt move very quickly and missed breakfast. Let me add the line wasnt very long. The food was ok for a low price buffet. The server that waited on our table was very quick, very friendly, and had a good sense of humor which is needed when waiting on my crazy family."}
{"text":"The feast buffet is a real find for those of you who are looking for a reasonably priced place to eat!   Good service and an attentive staff that works hard to serve their guests.   I found the food well prepared and hot and fresh. The salad bar was stocked with salads and fruits galore.   Is this comparable to a $65.00 buffet on the strip? Maybe not but you decided !   It's located in the Green Valley Ranch Casino Resort ."}
{"text":"I eat here on Sunday's. Besides getting half price off, just don't forget to play and sign up for players card and be on mailing list.  Since beginning of this year, the buffet has improved. I stopped going last year because of the quality,  but I must say this year is better. The salads are prepped well. Chinese section has improved.  And overall it is not bad. Hopefully they will continue to make it better."}
{"text":"I had two bad experiences at separate Station Casino Feast Buffet's.  At Palace Station's breakfast buffet fruit bar, I took some fruit to eat then became extremely disgusted. After I tasted the fruit, it triggered some kind of perception like there was a dead rodent found in the refrigerator that morning, but that the food next to the carcass was still served to unknowing customer's - so I asked myself, is it me who is at the bottom the food chain here? ha, ha...just messin' with ya  At Boulder Station I had as gross an experience as one can have at a smorgasbord. It was the lunch buffet. I took from the Asian vegetarian counter, then also had juice to drink. All I can say is that when I got home I suffered from food borne illness or poisoning. If I died that day I doubt anybody would have found Salmonella, Listeria, E. coli or arsenic as the cause!   If you go, I wish you luck."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at the Boulder Station lunch buffet. The problem came from inside the Asian vegetarian or fruit drink I consumed. When I arrived home I began suffering from food borne illness or poisoning. I was discouraged and decided to count on my immune system to carry me through. I didn't seem to have the savvy to get what I ate analyzed and file a lawsuit. If I died nobody would have likely found Salmonella, Listeria, E. coli, or arsenic! What can you say, foul play, carelessness in food preparation .... ?  Someone said once that \"if it doesn't kill you it makes you stronger\" but when I think of Boulder Station Feast Buffet I shudder."}
{"text":"Feast Buffet is a cheap breakfast alternative about a 20 minute drive from the strip. Cheap is the best thing I can say about it.  The chef carving the ham should teach a class on serving without a smile because he seemed to be an expert on the topic. Ham, eggs, bacon, the usual standards were OK. Hash browns were burned. Nothing could save the bitter coffee. Gelato appears to be off limits during breakfast hours. Maybe a sign would help. Donuts had the taste and texture of something purchased at a week old bakery outlet. Server looked at my plate and actually asked \"Is everything tasty?\" If it was tasty, do you think my plate would still have all that food on it?  Two stars for cold orange juice, cleanliness and free garage parking."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the experience could have been better. Frankly, for what they serve the price isn't bad. $8.99 is fine and the food is decent. But today we ate there and next to us sat a homeless looking guy. I have nothing against the homeless but this guy was not only filthy, he was asleep. He had a full plate of food in front of him and food was spilled all over the table and the floor. After 15 minutes they told him he couldn't sleep there and he left. Couldn't SLEEP there? Why in the world would they allow someone so filthy to come in? It was terrible, not what we expect to be looking at and smelling while we eat."}
{"text":"I went here on my Wedding night. My husband and I are from Europe living in California,  and we appreciate bloated American food quantities.   In Europe (we are from Holland and Norway respectively) we have little concept of \"all you can eat.\" I find American buffets wonderfully indifferent to the common good, much like American motor vehicle (I own mustang with wasteful but FUN V8 engine)  We have some \"buffet,\" however, it is almost always \"all you can stack on a plate\" and then you have to pay for the next plate.  This buffet is easily one of the best deals for the price in vegas. My husband ate nothing but meat until he fell asleep at the table, and I was able to indulge my sweet tooth. The sushi is a little dry, but the prime rib is excellent and worth the price of admission alone."}
{"text":"This is my wife and i's favorite place to eat my favorite day of the week l mean my favorite 2 days is Friday and Saturday rib nights . All the other days are wonderful too we can't get enough of the healthy choices and the staff are very friendly and accommodating we just love it ."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all . First and last Time here. The buffet area smells of cigarette smoke awful! The food is comparable to Golden Corral buffet in Utah , bland, no quality."}
{"text":"Best place ever!! Food is on point delicious!the cucumber salad is the Best! I would also recommend the burgers they are so good!& the price is incredible for the quality of the food,everyone is super nice! Something else I love is that it's on the second floor away from the smokers and the have tile inside the buffet something that makes it cleaner love this place"}
{"text":"My family and I love and enjoy this buffet very much. Always great service. And of course the varieties."}
{"text":"You can't really beat a breakfast buffet for $5. I didn't eat lunch or dinner, so I can't comment. But the selections seemed good. They have Mexican, Asian, Pizza, etc.  For the breakfast, at $5, that's a bargain. And with all the choices, it was amazing. They have waffles, pancakes, and french toast and all the fixings (didn't see a sugar free option though). They have churros (and a pretty large selection of mexican options). Sausage, sauteed veggies and sausage, bacon, ham, chicken fried steak, biscuits and gravy, spanish rice, beans, tortillas, hush puppies, chicken veggie soup, Chorizo and eggs, scarmbled eggs. They have fruit. One negative is their pastry selection is all donuts. But for $5, I can honestly overlook that as I was never a huge pastry person.  The biggest plus is they have made to order omelets, which is a winner in my book.   A bargain for $5, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Service was great and for $8 you are getting your money's worth. If you are expecting to get same type of food at Caesar then you need to head to Caesar and pay their price. I won't compare this place to Caesar but as a local buffet it is not too bad. I would say it maybe better then Paris or MGM but won't compare to Aria, Mandalay or Cosmo."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in over 2 years plus, but based on the same menu, I wouldn't have noticed. Looked like the same as before. Meat in carving station dry. Lack of flavor on most of the dishes. Salad and fruit bar not much to choose from. I know you get what you pay for. Maybe the owners need to put some money into a new menu."}
{"text":"Do not go here. Food is stale and old. Went for dinner. The food was gross, tasteless, and left over from the lunch. Every thing (everything) was dry due to being left on the counter for hours. There is no quality control what so ever. Even fork and diner ware was dirty and stained."}
{"text":"I had a rubber band in my baked potato yuk so disgusting. It was from either sombodies hair or who knows . Never going back"}
{"text":"The food was overall good. There was a wide selection of different cuisines. Lots of different meats soups and dishes. Most were pretty good. My girlfriend has been eyeing the deserts the whole time so they must be pretty good as well. Overall worth going to."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets we ever had. We went for lunch and the create your own pasta was fabulous! My husband said the orange chicken is the best he's ever had. The create your own stir fry was good too. Drinks are included and it was only 10 bucks. The service wasn't the best but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Sigh. This place used to rock, but just went during a weeknight (Tuesday) and it was horrible!  Turkey too dry, roast too fatty, and ham too salty.  Goldilocks would have been disappointed as nothing was 'just right'.  Desserts were 'ok'.  Weekend buffet has crab legs and seafood that I remember being great, but man what a disappointing experience this time around.  Hate to say it, but I preferred the Sunset Station buffet better..."}
{"text":"Went Sunday night, and the prime rib was excellent! Melted in your mouth. Everything else was standard buffet fare high in carbs and preservatives, but the prime rib alone was memorable."}
{"text":"Only went to this buffet because we were in the casino because my parents like the hotel.  we all got player cards  so we saved a few bucks, but honestly, even at the reduced sunday price, it wasn't worth the money at all.  the good: not too much, but the salad bar was alright, it was nice and fresh, the mexican food was probably the best of the regular food and what i had the most of.  dessert was pretty good as they have a lot of pies and stuff you can choose from, and a gelato bar with a few flavor so it was decent  the bad: the fish in the sushi was brown (not light brown, but browner than my skin which is pretty brown).  our waitress kept saying she was sorry for taking forever bringing drinks and how she is swamped with all her tables that she has and she was so busy.  that excuse could have worked if you werent just standing around chatting all the time lady.  if you are so busy, don't stand around chatting to everyone, get your work done.  overall, most of the other food at the buffet was just really bland and didn't taste good.  ill pass on coming back here for sure, and i probably won't be back as red rock is so far out of the way from the strip or downtown"}
{"text":"Defiantly better then most station casino .It kept really cleaning has a nice atmosphere .Food wasn't that bad very good for the price.I would recommend if your looking for less expensive option"}
{"text":"All cheap carbs.  Selection and quality are gone.  Was once good, years ago, now hotdogs, burgers, pizza and noodles. Chinese and mexican are all carb dishes, save some cheap bowl of something i cant make out.  Very little protein, and what there is isn't worth the price.  So very sad.     Don't bother.  Wasn't even worth the price after I used a bogo coupon.  The grand cafe is much better.  Eat there."}
{"text":"Fantastic value compared to other Vegas buffets. With a boarding pass card (sign up is free online) it costs $13.99. They did not have prime rib but did have top round which was fine. The beef noodle soup was tasty. Chilli verde with chicken was very flavorful (I had it on spanish rice). The salad with pecans, gorgonzola cheese, strawberries was awesome. My son liked his pizza and the cha shao bao. I thought the bread pudding was a winner. Not the best buffet ever in terms of food quality. But I would go back because the food was good quality, and I felt that the value was high. As hotel guests, the line for us was shorter."}
{"text":"Been here twice already...once for breakfast during a week day and last Saturday for dinner where they offer prime ribs (only on a Saturday). Let me just say the prime ribs was simply fantastic as it is carve for you that can be seared on request. Tender like how it should be done full of flavor that could put Lawry's to shame. Yes, I said it cause I had Lawry's $50 cut the last time I was in Vegas which my Mom has stated as the best she ever had like ever and can't stop raving about it when discussing such topics. Well Mom, this one just tops it for me :) Sorry I didn't have any actual images because I was too busy stuffing my face with prime ribs at this buffet in Red Rock.   For breakfast, they will make your omelette any way you like it. Nothing new there as many other buffets in Vegas casinos offer the same service. Just tip a buck if you do have it made as you wait a bit cause I saw 80% of those waiting did which is the right thing to do!  Along with the omelette, I like the baked ham which they will carve for you, bacon and small size waffles the most. And don't forget to save some room for the gelato in many flavors at the dessert station.   The waiter was attentive in accommodating our drinks for breakfast despite how busy it was. Overall, it's one of the best buffet I had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food and very nice atmosphere. Price is a bit high for what is offered but still much better than most buffets here in Vegas. I would highly recommend both this location and the other at the Red Rock Casino."}
{"text":"We got inspired by the ads on the 15 freeway with $7.99 buffet specials to go here. Not the greatest buffet in the world but you get what you pay for and then some.  Decent food with the fried chicken and Chinese food.  Deserts were pretty good especially with the cheesecakes but just your average buffet and a cheap price.  Not a bad place to eat especially for some that needs to save their money, in which you need in Vegas"}
{"text":"Located 100 yards inside the Sunset Station casino. Breakfast, 8A-11A, $5; lunch, 11A-4P, $8; dinner, 4P-9P, $10; Sunday brunch, 8A-4P, $10.  (Prices reflect $1 players' card discount.)  Lunch/dinner features Asian grill with chicken or beef; pork ribs; soups; hamburgers; carved brisket or turkey, pizza, Mexican dishes, salad bar. Roasted garlic cloves, yum!   Salad bar OK but is contained in a low-height cabinet; if you're tall like me you'll have to seriously contort your body to get at it.    Gelatos, frozen yogurt for dessert.    Lines can be long unless you have a handicapped placard or premium level players' card."}
{"text":"Haven't been to the buffet in 4 years because it got so bad. Tried it today, and everything was awful, the dessert was the only thing tasty. Every station I went to had empty bowls, I asked if there was anymore fried chicken and was rudely told it wasn't ready yet. Will NEVER be back"}
{"text":"The food is awful for the amount of money they charge. It would still be awful if they charged less. The service is ok and the atmosphere is nice but it is all ruined by the large group of extremely cranky and overly opinionated senior citizens who seem to think we are eating at their home. I will not be coming back to this station buffet."}
{"text":"This place SUCKS my whole family threw up 2014  Santa fe SUCKS 2009 Santa fe was awesome don't eat here just go to in and out"}
{"text":"What a sucker I am. All it took was another 2for1 offer in the mail to bring me back in. This place is heavy on southern-style cuisine, barbecue, Cajun, and they'll have a carving station with turkey and ham.   The buffet is large for an off-strip site, lots of selections but all the selections are average to poor in quality.   I don't go for the fare as much as the local color, which might frighten most but I find it entertaining as hell. The last time I went the place was crammed with characters, I was half expecting Charles Ramsey to bust in any second to start chowing down on some ribs and make an explicit 911 call."}
{"text":"When it comes to buffets I like to call myself experienced!! I love them! They are always full of an awesome variety of food and you can never go wrong with the fresh made stir fry.... Unless you eat here  What a terrible I mean terrible Dinner Starting off with the worst customer service ever. Vegas is known for there buffets and great food and service at restaurants and other things but we are are talking food here!   I kid you not after about a 15 min wait in line which is typical for buffets around dinner time so I'm not complaining about that but what started the hatred was the simple fact that it took 45 min to get our drinks. Yeah ok we had a table of 9 including kids but seriously 45 min to get water and a soda. We all were on our second go around of plates and ready to make the third trip down when we finally got our order of drinks that was placed when we first got there. Then to top it off as normal we finished our drinks fast yeah we were thirsty the lady took roughly 15-20 min To come back to our table with our refills. At this point I asked if she could just bring us a pitcher of water. Which to our surprise was pretty fast. (Now after you read my rant go through there pictures and witness first hand the nasty filthy pitcher she put on our table.) as we examine the filth inside and out and with the disappearance of our server again we decide to go to the front and ask to speak with a manager. Lady says what table are you ok I will send the manager there. 10 min 20 min 30 min 45 min go bye and finally after the waitress who just sees all of us sitting there asks If there is anything you need. At this point we say yes the manager that we have been waiting for! Now side note I'm not one to complain and moan but when it's bad it's bad. Finally after over 45 min the manager comes to our table we explain to her our issues with the wait for her, the drinks, the terrible service the terrible dried out food....which I've yet to rant about... The dirty nasty pitcher were just a few things that we laid into her. Much to our surprise She begins to defend her staff and say well thats not what she said, and on and on... lady look at the pitcher and examine the situation before you speak... then she goes on saying well you asked for a pitcher.. Damn straight we asked for a pitcher of water. Well I'm sorry sir but we don't give pitchers here. Ok wtf you did and look at it. Yes sir it appears to be dirty but again we do not give out pitchers and sir the water is clear... Wait what did she say. The water is clear so what my dogs bowl water is clear and you don't see me drinking Out of there bowl! Anyway she results to saying after she finally examines the situation and sees that it's been bad she lays into the server and basically tells her off she says well I can give you 2 comps and you can eat here again for free....um let me think about that. The service was terrible, the dish wear was filthy I mean so bad I wouldn't let my dog use it, the food was less than mediocre... hmm yeah I would love to come back said no one ever!!"}
{"text":"Just went to Feast Buffet at GVR and found it to be just OK.  Granted it was Easter Sunday which might of accounted for the 11/2 wait for a buffet that had no stand out dishes at all, but you get what you pay for $18.99.  The staff was polite and very helpful.  I don't think I'd go back for the buffet, but the resort is a yes."}
{"text":"Literally one of the best buffets ever! The food was really good and loved the selection! Also the price was outstanding. Haven't gone for breakfast, but dinner was yum!"}
{"text":"Seriously yuck! It might be decent enough for SAD eaters but for people with limited diet requirements it is just plain sad. The reason I came here in the first place is, I received a free buffet voucher from a friend that works at the Red Rock. The only way I'll be back is if it's free then I can munch on oatmeal, salad or whatevs. I actually spit the hash browns back onto the plate and walked out."}
{"text":"Excellent food and staff is always pleasant if not down right friendly. I enjoy \"Chairman\" status it pays to lose money in the casino - it shortens the buffet entry lines. Ha!"}
{"text":"How Bad Can a Brunch Be?  Only can blame myself for giving The Feast Buffet at Red Rock Casino another try. Was our favorite place for a number of years after the casino opened in 2006.  Stayed away for quite a while because quality and variety of food has gone down hill. On this particular day (4-10-16), the only thing that was edible was the omelet.  The most disturbing was the lack of care of the cooking staff, especially at the carving station. Next to the roast beef, there were pile of dried up pieces of meat and the roast beef was not trimmed until people ordered. Rather disgusting. The meat was so tough even the carver joked that he needed to sharpen his knife.  A lot of other food items were so old, they should be trucked to the pig farm."}
{"text":"This place was great. I had a bit of everything they had. From their Asian cuisine to the American section. For dessert, I had the mint and chip gelato.  All you can eat for a really cheap price. And, if you have any rewards, even better. My wife and I ate for $2.90. Good place to go if you don't know what kind of food you want to eat."}
{"text":"This is a good buffet.  One of the better Stations buffets overall.  It's $13.99 for dinner with the players club card.  Sarah A mentioned crab legs... they actually haven't had crab legs in over a year since they lowered the price.  The crab legs really used to be the big draw here, but sadly no more.  It's still good though and well worth the $14.  One of the highlights now is the mongolian station where you can also get Kalbi Beef Korean short ribs, along with the normal mongolian stir fry choices.  There's the typical Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and American stations.  And they also have a decent dessert variety with plenty of NSA items as well."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best buffets.  USED TO BE!  Now its terrible.  The kicker is that Stations charges more at this one and Green Valley Ranch than their others.  While GVR is still good (not as good as it was before the price drops, but still good) Red Rock is NOT GOOD.  Several of the Stations $9.99 buffets put the Red Rock to shame.  The last 3 visits were terrible.  The last straw was for Thanksgiving dinner.  Nothing tasted good, and the variety was a joke.  They had advertised many things on the special Thanksgiving menu.  Well, let me just say that the 'Barbecue Shrimp' was the small cold cocktail shrimps drown in nasty cold bbq sauce.  Who thinks that's Barbecue Shrimp?  And the 'Lamb Chops' were just hunks of lamb roast plopped onto your plate.  And the sushi... SUSHI?  What sushi??  Mini tuna rolls and thats it?  You get the idea.  I understand that when they lowered the price about a year ago, that the variety and quality would go down.  But this one isn't worth any amount of money.  And the $18.99 for Thanksgiving was just ridiculous.  The ONLY saving grace was that we skipped the looooong 1-2 hour lines with the President card.  3 strikes and you're out!  We will definately NOT be back."}
{"text":"The best place in town for weekend brunch.Only 11 dollars a person! Fresh omelets made to order,carving station,shrimp,awesome biscuits and gravy,and all you can drink champagne! A bit out of the way for me,but it's worth it"}
{"text":"I've been to this place quite a few times, and most of the time they have pretty awesome selection of food. The place is pretty spacious, and most of the staff is nice. The price is good as well. The ambient is also good.  I recommend it."}
{"text":"It's warm trash served with a grin. Save your money!  Prime rib is over done and seafood is fishy at best."}
{"text":"It's not bad for the low price. My only complaint is about the desserts--some were awfully dry. That aside, the servers were efficient and friendly, which made the experience pleasant."}
{"text":"This was a good buffet considering the price is very reasonable. Six of us went, three adults and three kids. Our service was excellent. Our waiter took very good care of us, making sure we always had drink refills and taking our empty plates in a timely manner. The food was decent, some of it was a bit dry or bland but we liked 80% of what we ate.  The dining areas and food serving areas were clean.  Of course you can't compare this place to the bigger, fancier Vegas buffets, but we would definitely go back if we were looking for an inexpensive buffet option."}
{"text":"I have been to the Feast Buffet at Boulder Station over and over again. I have been for lunch and dinner every time so far. This is the first time I have been for breakfast. It was on Sunday for their Sunday Brunch. I have to say that I was very impressed with the brunch. Lunches and dinners have been very lacking, but this Brunch was very good. The bacon was cooked just right. It had a wonderful flavor and it and was cooked as to be not to crunchy or limp. I had a slice of ham that was so succulent and tender. I also tried three different types of potatoes. I had some mashed, au gratin, and hash browns. Each was done quite nicely and had a good flavor to them. Most of the time when I have fruit at the Feast Buffet it is not flavorful at all. This time both the watermelon and honeydew were very juicy and flavorful. I grabbed a bit of cherry cobbler and was impressed. The cherries were not to tart or sweet. The cobbler had a nice texture and flavor to it. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but I did enjoy it.  We were seated pretty quickly. We arrived before the big rush and did not have to wait to long. Our server got to us soon after sitting down. She got our refills on our drinks in a very timely manner. All in all I was impressed this time. I will be happy to give the Feast another try."}
{"text":"I will never step foot in Boulder Station again because of this buffet. The whole time I was wondering am I at \"Dicks Last Resort\" you know the restaurant where you pay for the staff to be rude to you. Every single person who worked there from the front staff to the waiter to the people behind the buffet counter...RUDE!!! It might have made up for it if the food was half way decent, but it is not! Save your money, there are far better buffets with better service for a better price elsewhere. Boulder Station, your buffet staff has lost your casino a local patron."}
{"text":"We went for this buffet twice in Dec. 2010, when there was a pretty decent promotion on the buffet price. We got $6.99 for the lunch and $4.99 for the breakfast.  The dining area is pretty nice and comfort, better than most of the hotel on strip. But the food is just ok. You get what you paid.  But with the low price, it certainly worth a try."}
{"text":"3 stars because the price was great, beers were cheap, and enough of a selection that I was full. However you get what you pay for when it comes the quality and taste of the food. I think most the time I would rather pay the extra money to go to Cravings at the Mirage and get amazing food and all you can drink beer and wine. But if you want to fill up for $10 or less than this will do just fine. One bonus with the Station Casino buffets is you can earn points towards free buffets just by cashing your paychecks."}
{"text":"I had not been there in over ten years and had a great meal last time. Sadly things are much different now. The price for a weekday dinner was over $8 with a 50% off coupon and it still was not worth it. First I tried the Orange Chicken. The chicken was cooked properly but the flavor is the cheap Orange flavor like what you get with the generic frozen version of Orange Chicken. Next I tried the pasta noodles. They too were cooked fine but the Alfredo sauce was as bland as water. The bread sticks were hard as a rock.  New batch came out later and they were also hard as a rock. The pizza looked good but after I took a bite, all I could taste is salt. I like salt but heavy salt use in pizza sauce just ruins it. I then went to try the tacos. Flour tortillas were soft and the cheese and other condiments were fresh.  Not sure how the ground beef was made other than relying on a lot peppers both red and green. Flavor again was lacking. Dessert was a chocolate fudge cake. Sadly fudge type is all the rage these days and it is hard to find a regular good old Chocolate cake. The icing on these things is not just on top but at two layers before you get to the bottom. Way too sugary for most folks. The Chocolate Chip cookies were decent and soft. I would not recommend this buffet to anyone. Go to the food court they have there to get some flavor for your $8. Just throw the coupon away and eat elsewhere.  The seating was also close and cramped so getting back and forth with your food  often meant getting cozy to someone eating at another table in order for someone to pass the other direction. Pretty place but what a shame the quality of the food is nowhere near what it used to be many years ago."}
{"text":"Saturday afternoon my wife and I, who love local buffets, decided not to go to our favorite buffet at Red Rock for lunch.  We heard the lines were long because of a number events in Vegas.  We decided instead to go to an old favorite, the Sante Fe buffet.  What a mistake!  We were amazed at how far it had fallen in the last few months since we last visited it.  We understand the economics of a buffet, and the somewhat tough economic times,  but they cut corners way to far.  Poor selection, low quality and unappealing presentation. The didn't even have my favorite, sausages and peppers which almost every buffet has. The service was spotty, but acceptable. Since it was Saturday, we didn't have two-fers and paid full freight.  I think in the future, I'll brave the lines and go to Red Rock."}
{"text":"Sunday night, my wife and I went to our favorite local buffet...the Feast at Red Rocks. As always, the food was very good, the service fair, great variety, and the  presentation was excellent. They now have cordon bleu which was really good, even though it was not labeled and many people didn't seem to know what it was. And my wife just loved the very nicedly grilled salmon. But this review is not about the food, its about the extremely long wait lines.  Though you would expect long waits on a Sunday evening, the experience did  not have to be quite so difficult.  We got on line about 6:00 and paid about 6:30.  Then the line just stopped with practically no movement.  We seemed to mill around in that small area for the longest time. It was about 7:10 when we finally got seated.  The seating process was chaotic, to say the least. One lady seemed to be running the whole show and she appeared overwhelmed.  The most bothersome thing was that it was obvious that there were many open tables ... they just weren't cleared so they sat empty. I asked a manager about this.  He said that they had a large tour group come in and they had to assign a good part of the wait staff to this group. Couldn't management prepare for this and put on some additional staff? The people immediately behind us in the line didn't want to wait so they turned around and returned their ticket.  Really, I love Red Rocks and would like to keep going, but I would hope for a more pleasureable experience the next time."}
{"text":"Delicious and super friendly Vegas buffet. A must try. It's at the Red Rock Casino which is about a half hour drive from the strip. Saturday night dinner starts at 3:30-9 pm is a definitely stop by for prime rib and shrimp lovers. It's costs a little over $20 per person. Nice drive and a different taste of Vegas."}
{"text":"So where do I begin.  They had hamburger buns but no hamburgers.  Taco shells and meat but no lettuce or cheese.  The best part was the ham.  Everything else lacked flavor and made me feel not to well.  Never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Being that I don't really live in the area, and it is the OLDEST of the \"Station Casinos\" (starting as Bingo Palace in 1976), I make it a point to avoid Palace Station. It seems a bit run-down, old, and there is a \"funky\" odor about it.   I've eaten at the buffet several times prior to 2004, but stopped going when I had a bad experience, not to mention moving into another part of town. I usually stick close to where I live when it comes to eating.  Now, I've been to the Santa Fe Station's buffet, the one at Red Rock, Green Valley Ranch, Sunset Station, and even Texas Station. They're awesome. I do love GVR and Santa Fe buffets more.   Palace Station? My visit on 9/19/2014 was a reminder of why I don't go there.   Being that I played \"myVegas\" Rewards on Facebook, I was delighted to see that they had \"comps\" and rewards to Red Rock, Palace Station, and another Station Casino.  Since my mom works 4-hours on Fridays, I decided that the lunch would be a great idea since she works in the area.   It was the worst idea. Thankfully, it was free. That's the only good part of the meal and experience.  First I had to stop at the Rewards Center to get my \"comp\", then it was upstairs to the buffet. There was no one in line, so my mom and I walked up to the counter. The cashier was quite nasty even before I brought out the comp slip. I had to show my Driver License and Boarding Pass.   The cashier rung up the meal, and handed my \"loyalty\" card to my mother and dismissed me entirely; despite the fact it was MY \"comp\" that paid for the meal. The cashier didn't even look at me as she handed the card and receipt to my mother.   At age 38, I think I've passed the \"oh, you look so young stage\" that the cashier felt she needed to hand my card to my mother. Sorry, but I found that insulting. One has to be 21 to get a \"Boarding Pass\", and mine has my \"member since date\" on it. It was issued in 1997, over 17 years ago.   Getting over that incident, my mother handed my Boarding Pass back to me so I could put it in MY wallet. That didn't start off the experience that well. But, I let it go. Maybe for some reason, the cashier was having a bad day.   Then we waited, and waited ... for about 15 minutes to be seated. The reason? NONE. There were PLENTY of tables. In the one section we were seated in, there were only eight other patrons. That area could easily seat 150, or more. Yet, we had to wait.   Sorry, but if you have the seating available ... you should seat your patrons asap. But, that's my take on it.   All unoccupied tables were clean and ready for people to sit at, so it wasn't as if they'd been busy and were cleaning up.   We were able to order the drinks quite quickly, but once we got our food? We weren't asked if we wanted refills on our drinks until we were bone dry, and ready to leave. We were cleaning up our area, and grabbing our purses when we were asked if we wanted refills.   No thanks, we're leaving.  The staff didn't bother to check on us, only took the dirty plates and walked away -- place wasn't that busy either. Again, only eight people in our section, and there were 3-4 servers working the area. Maybe they're having a bad day. So, I figured we'd ease their load and leave.  As far as the food ...   The food was terrible. Honestly, it SUCKED!   In addition to such a small selection, the meats, including the turkey were OVERCOOKED, TOUGH, and DRY. The supposedly \"hot\" pasta was COLD, most of the cold foods were on the warm side, the warm foods? Stone cold. The only good thing? The desserts.They were the ONLY edible part of the meal.   Again, since it was free, I can't complain too much. But, I wouldn't pay for it whether or not it is a \"great value\". Isn't a great value if you can't eat much of the selection and the service is not up to par.   Maybe they were having a terrible day, maybe they were off. But, I don't think I will visit again. I can't justify rating a place simply on price. I have been to better, and I've been to the worst. The worst was the old (now gone) Boardwalk Holiday Inn Buffet on the strip. This one? I'll pass. It's not going to be the end of my world."}
{"text":"They need to close this place down and start all over !! What a shame from the horrid service to the lousy food this is by far one of the worst, if not the worst buffet in this town !!  We got there early on Saturday around 4:30 and almost everything was empty. But it really didn't matter because when they did replinish the food it was so bad that we wished we had not gone at all.   They don't have prime rib but instead \"roast beef\" which was so tough that it could not be chewed....desserts were mouths full of sugar....salads were limp from sitting so long and a piece of chicken one of us got was actually \"ice cold\" and white colored as in \"not cooked\".  The Mexican station had several soups and we asked for a bowl and they said we had to go over to the salad bar to get a bowl...what ????? same thing with the Chinese station and the egg drop soup...no bowls.  That pretty much sums up the lack of management in this place. We will NEVER go back and you would be wise not to either !!"}
{"text":"Its been several months since my last visit and I'm happy to report that it is much better. Its always been consistent and good but now its been kicked up a notch. It seems they care a little more as their is a much better variety of foods to choose from. Instead of a bunch of pre cooked stir fry. They now have a stir fry station where you get to pick your own fresh ingredients and have it cooked fresh, right there.  As I was typing this, chef Mark stopped by our table to see how we enjoyed the food. We asked him what changed and he told us that he was hired in January to make the buffet better. Nice job, chef! Keep up the good work!  The food is much, much better, with more variety, and a chef who obviously cares about his customers."}
{"text":"Decent buffet off the strip. The quality of the food is good (except for the meat which was fair). Not a large selection but for the price it was not that bad."}
{"text":"Went to Sunday brunch at the feast buffet. They are not serving crab legs on the buffet in Dec,that doesn't  bother me I don't really eat crab legs at buffets to messy for me.         The good thing about this was they charge less about $12 per person. The quality is pretty good too. Everthing I ate on the the Chinese station was tasty and fresh.   The menudo soup was very good , better then most Mexican restaurants in town, for some reason I always have to season my menudo soup at Mexican restaurants not here. The prime rib was good quality not like some other buffets where they went too a cheaper off tasting product. I can't explain it , but I know it when I taste it.               I saved the best for last, the bread pudding is one of the best or the best I ever had.  When they first opened I fell in love w/ this bread pudding, There was a time I would crave it .  It is crusty on top and very moist at the bottom, it is very custard like , they also have a creme anglais( thin vanilla custard sauce) that u can put on it to make it even better.             Very glad that the quality has not gone down like some other station  casino buffets."}
{"text":"Came here for Veteran's Day lunch and they were giving free meals to Veterans.  WTG Station Casinos!  The line was a little past all the ropes and took about 20 minutes to get seated - not bad.  All of the food was hot and fresh and very diverse.  My favorites were the lightly breaded sauteed fish with lemon caper sauce - excellent-sauteed brussell sprouts with bacon, pierogis (little potato pancake pastries), pecan bleu cheese spring mix salad, roasted chili peppers and pumpkin gelato for dessert.  I will be going back to see if it is always this good."}
{"text":"If you want GOOD buffet, go to the WYNN or RIO, but you get what you pay for. This is the \"on-the-cheap\" low low end buffet for desperate gamblers to get a fill and head back to the slots. This is in no way a good dinner spot unless you just happen to be there and need something quick and cheap. I would suggest TGIFridays which is in this casino. I go here on occasion when I get a 2 for 1 coupon in the mail or if we are at the casino already and just want to grab something fast. Avoid when possible. The food lacks flavor, is not satisfying and this place would not survive if it was a stand alone restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm always satisfied when I eat at Feast Buffet. There's quite a few reasons I enjoy this particular buffet. I receive the 2 for 1 coupon from Red Rock Casino in the mail usually once a month which is nice to use! My roommate and I take turns buying the one buffet for 9 dollars! Feast Buffet is a good deal even when you don't have the coupon!   The food is also pretty good! They have a decent amount of vegetarian and vegan options! Even a lot for people who are gluten free. My roommate is vegan and gluten free while I'm just vegetarian and she gets just as much out of the buffet as me! They have constantly put out the same lunch buffet each time. Today was exceptionally good though! The flavors were right, everything was fres"}
{"text":"Nice enough place. The second best of the station casino buffets, the best being the one at Main Street Station. Fairly large selection, while not a ton for a veggie like me. Very friendly staff, but mediocre food and everything else. My server was great, even anticipating when I would finish a drink and bring a refill. That's pretty much all I enjoyed. There is a lingering smell of smoke that was quite unpleasant, but most casinos have that. Anyway, if you want a very cheap buffet with average comfort food and desserts, this place is for you."}
{"text":"Drove all the way out here for crab legs. None to be found... Mangament told me to pound sand food was ehhh customer service can get f*cked tho."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since 2008.  Tonight the quality and selection were so bad we will no longer be coming back.  Lots of hot items were cold, wouldn't pass a health inspection on food temp.  Even the desert selection was considerably limited.  Cakes were dry and crusty.  I was lucky to find anything to eat at all.  Bleh!"}
{"text":"Disappointing!  My hubby and I went here a couple weeks back on a Sunday evening around 7 pm.  That night was quite good, not real crowded and quiet.  Fast forward to this past Sunday, 12/16/12.  Oh my gosh!  What a difference 1 hour and 2 weeks make!    We arrived around 5:45 p.m.  The place was crowded with a bunch of families.  The kids (pre teens, teens) were running around and I even overheard one say as he walked past \"they f***ed up my cornbread!\"  Really?  I waited at the carving station and asked for one slice of top round and one slice of turkey.  Mind you I had an empty plate at this point.  My turkey slice was more like half a slice and if I could shave my legs as close as the cook shaved my slice of turkey, I would be a happy camper!  It was so thin I could practically see through it!  After perusing all the food stations I ended up with salad, one piece of top round, one half-slice of turkey and mashed potatoes.  That's it.  My poor hubby ended up with salad.  We both had to steer clear of the ranch since it was a nice off beige color.    A lot of the food stations were either empty, contained obvious old food, missing name plates so we had no idea what the item was or dirty.  There was a broken coffee mug on the floor near the Mexican station that the kids were kicking out of the way.  We ended up leaving about 6:10 or so and headed to McDonald's so hubby could grab some food.    Between the type of clientele there that night, the lack of food and the condition of the food that WAS there I don't think we will be back.  We will stick with the Santa Fe buffet."}
{"text":"Went here tonight looking forward to their \"Prime Rib\" night. The line was long to get in and the place was busy. Well needless to say we were attended to right away. So my friend goes and gets some prime rib. He asks the cook to cook the slice some more two times. Upon his third request the cook continued to ignore him and then places the meat on the plate and says that once the meat touches the plate he can't take it back. Oh, now you heard the customer's request?  So when my friend tells me this as he arrives at our table, I tell him to leave the plate and get another. As our waiter comes by he asks if he should take the plate. We say yes and why. The waiter gives us a real nasty look like we are crazy. I go to the salad bar and there's an Asian salad. I'm allergic to shell fish so there's a staff member behind the counter and I had to yell to get her attention. I ask if there's any shell fish or shell fish ingredients in the Asian salad. The staff member gives me a flip attitude and tells me \"It's Asian Salad\". Um really? I ask again, she turns away then turns back and says its vegetarian. So I'm about to take some and she stops me and says not to take any as they use a fish sauce in the dressing. Oh? So then it's NOT vegetarian! The food stations at the international section were empty and lacked any appeal. The food was sub par. I'm really really disappointed and came home hungry. I will never go back and will never recommend this Buffett! Staff was flip and rude and the food was gross."}
{"text":"They've lowered the price - and Everything Else. At 6:00 PM on a Friday many items in the buffet were dried out and tough. Service was below average. At one point I just got tired of waiting on a refill and walked into the service area and refilled my own glass. This was the Seafood Buffet, at a higher price, however from what I saw most of the seafood swam away from this Buffet. They should be ashamed of calling this a Seafood Buffet. You can do Much better in Vegas for the $ 17.00 spent on this lower quality buffet. And did I forget to mention it was almost an hour wait from entering the line to being seated."}
{"text":"It's a Cheap Eat.  It's not worth a drive out of the way; however for the price of a burger and drink at the Fast Food Joint I would eat here instead.  Plus you will find a few things in the Buffet you will like in addition to the soup and salad. Use a Free Station Casino card to get your discount."}
{"text":"Station Buffet has seriously downgraded over the last few months. Rotton Tomatoes in the Salad Bar with indifferent workers to take care of it. Casino is in serious financial difficulty (like most), however with the new lower prices I believe the Pigs at the nearby Pig Farm get  safer food than what is served here. If you eat at Station Buffets limit yourself to Red Rocks and Green Valley and know they have downgraded also."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with my family and I have to say that we are all disappointed! Giving two stars only for the staff who were super friendly and came by often to make sure our drinks were full, other then that the food was terrible!"}
{"text":"Okay so the only reason I would and did come here is because with a 2 for 1 coupon (dinner for two was about $12.00 including drink and tip) and it is convenient for me. I would not stand in line for this place or go under other circumstances. I should preface this by stating as a general rule I do not like buffets, of course, there are exceptions i.e. Bacchanal, thai or indian lunch buffet. However, for the price (with coupon) who couldn't pass up a okay salad bar and a drink. The majority of the food is barely edible, sometimes the mexican and the chinese food is okay (at best). I think once in awhile the prime rib is okay (of course you have to assess if it is medium rare before they cut it). Tonight they served roast beef so I took a pass on that. The salad bar is not as good as Sweet Tomatoes as to variety but they have the usual fair - iceburg lettuce, spinach, cherry tomatoes, onions, croutons, broccoli salad and the like. How can you screw up salad?   The servers are attentive and the dining room is clean which is a plus. I have been to some buffets where this is lacking in both respects.   I don't find the dessert area appealing - the ice cream has a decent flavor but there is something about the texture that screams powdered milk product to me - the texture is somewhat grainy and leaves a slight filmy feel in my mouth if  I recollect correctly."}
{"text":"I came I came here about 3 weeks ago for the breakfast I had bacon and eggs with French toast it was amazing the service was amazing everything was clean and organized hoping to come back bring the whole family along"}
{"text":"Not all buffets are created equal.  Anyone who has been to one can tell you that you've got your buffets that are well-tended, and your buffets that look like a horde of ravenous beasts have just passed through.  The Feast Buffet is well-staffed and well-stocked, and has enough selection to keep anyone stuffed.  If you're coming here for Sunday Brunch, expect a line.  I have, on one occasion, counted eighty people in line...and that was just in the non-guest line.  There's a separate line for guests, individuals with small children, and handicapped persons.  That line was somewhat shorter, but still involved a wait.    Why were these people waiting in such a line?  Frankly, because the place is worth it!  Prime Rib was on offer, along with dishes from all the major cuisines.  A sushi chef prepared fresh sushi and sashimi at one end, a chef prepared lasagna at the counter next door, the smell of barbecue wafted from the counter beyond that while a woman restocked the quesadillas at the counter down the way.  And that was only on one side!  The other contained breakfast foods, desserts, Asian foods, and an ice cream counter.  The large salad bar was in the center and had it all.  Breakfast here is an inexpensive $5, while lunch will run you $7.  On Sundays the prices are higher on account of different (read: more expensive) food offerings.  I would consider the prices here quite reasonable for what you get.  If you're in the area and looking for buffet, try this one first."}
{"text":"The breakfast choices were so so. But I suppose it's what you get for $8.99. Just when I thought I was only going to eat one plate of decent food (home fries, chorizo eggs, spinach with eggs, and mini waffles), they started putting out lunch! Yay for us for being typically late to everything. We were able to get some lunch items but I was more excited about dessert! They had some delicious chewy cookies and a wide variety of ice cream. Super yum!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much you get what you pay for. For a cheap price you get all you can eat mediocre food. Service is decent as they took care of our part of 14 real nicely, and constantly checked up on us. My only concern is that the air reeks of cigarette smoke, making the experience unenjoyable. If you can get over the smoky ambiance, and the sub par food for a decent price, then this place is for you. I definitely won't be coming back, as I'll probably try somewhere else tastier and with fresher air."}
{"text":"Long lines because they delay seating new customers. Lots ov completely empty tables, they just are in no hurry to seat anyone.  We talked to Buffet Manager \"Brandy\" about it and she openly stated they control number of customers inside by making people wait in line. We were somewhat surprised at her answer and asked if customer satisfaction was her primary concern, and she coldly replied \"NO\" .  Needless to say, we will not return and advise all others to avoid disappointment as well. Go to Sunset Station or SouthPoint or The M, they are nearby and do care about customers."}
{"text":"Hey Station casinos don't ever send me your coupons again. All your stupid boarding pass gimmicks and all the other hoops that I have to jump through in order to redeem some of your pathetic games just simply isn't worth it. It's too frustrating and the unbelievable hassles and then after waiting and planning to go up there and spend my money Alls i get is a runaround and hassle... Sorry keep your coupons and your business! Never again!  Too complicated"}
{"text":"This buffet is FIIIRE!   It's the newest and nicest buffet in Vegas right now hands down. Red Rock Resort is crazy with the decors from the top to bottom! Well worth the $11 for lunch and the long line.   This place is huge! They have all the basics down like every other buffet (Asian, American, Italian, dessert, etc.) The food came out fine. Nothing impressive, but nothing to complain about. Customer service was great. Our cups were always kept filled to the top.   3 stars for the food and an extra star for the decors, vibe, and cleanliness."}
{"text":"I prefer the Sunday brunch due to  the upgraded options. Good service for a casino buffet"}
{"text":"This place is one of the most reasonably priced buffets that is still very good.  They have a variety of cuisines from Japanese, Chinese, BBQ, Mexican, and Italian and a pretty good salad bar.  The desserts are also very good and they have multiple gelato flavors.  The wait was over an hour though. Overall, I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We ate at the Feast buffet last night since we were staying in Henderson. It was pleasantly surprising and a good value at $9.99 with their rewards card. I met locals while waiting in line and they came here often. Last night was BBQ night and it was moist, tender and tasty. The carved meats were also good. I tried the turkey and stuffing with gravy and everything was good. What was nice is that everything seemed very fresh and nothing was dried out. The service could have been better as our server took a while to clear our plates. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Run as far as you can, (to the opposite direction ) this place smells horrible, wouldn't recommend it even if you could get it for free, very limited food options, quality and flavor 1 star, 2 stars for the service. red rock, green valley or sunset station (all of them feast buffets are WAAAAAAAY better."}
{"text":"The seafood night was bad.  Everything is salty, from crab to claim chowder.  Don't waste your money on seafood night.  The line is short, but it will take forever to get into the restaurant."}
{"text":"It's not much to complain about for the price, paying less then $10 at a buffet in Vegas that has at least some variety and free coffee/soft drinks is a pretty solid deal for the location. Only downside is that the food between lunch and dinner didn't change much so if you like it once, you'll probably like it again. I was pretty good after the first night but didn't really need to go again"}
{"text":"Literally everything I tried was so good. Prime Rib, pasta (although a little on the excessively oily side), sweet n sour rice, Gellato. I didn't care for their cake or cheesecake, but the rest of the food I got was spectacular. The only thing I would have changed was being able to serve my own drinks/refills. Took a bit to get them, but server was very nice and happy. Would definitely try this place again!"}
{"text":"Horrible management. The buffet closes at 930 and they were still letting people in at 9 (the buffet areas stopped replenishing their food at that time!).   In my specific case, my party paid at 8pm, but due to POOR management and organization, they let us in at 850pm. It was too late to leave coz we were fully paid and we just hoped and prayed we would get in the buffet area already.   All we were able to eat was the pasta, a cup of soup and scraps of veggies and meat. Additionally, the lady servers in the dessert bar made the situation even worse than it already was. The asian lady in the pie area wouldn't tell you what pies she had left even when you asked. She just gave me a blank stare as if she didn't understand what i was saying. On the other hand, the hispanic older lady in the gelatto bar wouldn't give us creme brulees even if she just gave this other man 5pcs! I asked if i can have one and she said she was out. SHE WASN'T! I saw she had so many left behind her station!   The only thing i liked about this place was the lady making the pasta. She was really nice and the pasta she whipped up for me was delicious!   DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for here.  If you live close by and want a low cast place to invite guests, you should give it a try.  If you live further away or are looking for quality food, I would suggest looking elsewhere.  The ice cream is shaved, the burgers are flavorless, and the juice tastes like the fruit punch you can buy in a gallon jug."}
{"text":"Just arrived. Based on the reviews I was a bit sketchy about this buffet. Our wait was a bit over 15 minutes. FYI this place is very similar to Home Town Buffet (all you can eat). Would I eat here again, NOPE!. For those who will like to know the prices are very reasonable we paid $30 for 3 adults and 1 child. You can receive points/discounts if you sign up for a reward club card. The card can also be used to play the machines. They also have $2 Margaritas two flavors Strawberry and Lemon."}
{"text":"We were very pleased with the lunch buffet. Catherine was our server. She was always smiling, cleared our table in a timely fashion & provided us with everything we asked for. Their glasses & pitchers are made of plastic. They're a little cloudy as any plastic cup thats been used & washed many times, but that didn't affect the taste of our beverages or the quality of our experience any. $10 per person for the lunch buffet is a fantastic value. There was a good variety of different foods & desserts. All the food we ate was very good. We will definately come again. Thinking about trying the seafood buffet."}
{"text":"u can eat till u drop for a very reasonable price if u sign up for theirs player's card. Weekends only offer lunch/dinner, no breakfast. Mimosas.... remember to get the mimosas... drinks r included in the paid price."}
{"text":"Maybe two stars is not fair.  Maybe I should never write a review for buffets given that I think I am biased against buffets.  I have eaten at the $60 buffets and the reasonably priced buffets (like Feast) and in my opinion they are all just so...yuck.  When I see people lined up for 45 minutes to go in and eat food that is processed and mass produced with a quality that rivals that of the Safeway deli.  I ask you, If you saw a restaurant near home whose sign read \"Italian-American-Chinese-Japanese-Seafood-French Restaurant, would you go?  Hell no because you know it is impossible to do all those type of foods with quality.  Why do I go?  Because I love my partner who likes to go.  The sacrifices we make for love.  I'm telling you.        But I digress.  If you are more interested in quantity than quality, just got back from the dentist and have numbed taste buds or need a place to take your 500 pound mother-in-law and not break the bank, then by all means Bon Apetit.  For me, I'd rather go to the Fat Burger in the casino."}
{"text":"Great for brunch, but I expected more and better tasting. Great to bring groups, The food wasn't its best though I like the prime rib. The price was fair for a buffet in Las Vegas. Not really a great tasting so called feast buffet..."}
{"text":"wow.horribad buffet.got a 2 for 1 coupon, ate more than i should, and i still feel like i overpaid.the food itself was not completely hopeless, but the selection and size of the place was.the wait staff seems completely bored and walk by to check up on you so much that its annoying.i know you want a tip, but cool it a little.i wasn't expecting filet mignon here, but a wider variety of food would be nice. it is a buffet after all.if they got rid of the ridiculously large desert station, they might have enough room to fit some more actual food."}
{"text":"Outstanding buffet. The salmon, steak fajitas and prime rib were outstanding, as were the salads and desserts.  I'd highly recommend this eatery!"}
{"text":"For the price this is a great buffet.  This buffet is 1000 times better then Golden Corral. They really have decent quality food.  There is a reason the cheap cab drives of Las Vegas eat here.  Please live a decent tip if you eat here.  The servers really deserve it.  They don't get many good tips from those cheap foreign cab drives.  Get a club card sign up is free and go during the week and the buffet for dinner is like 8.99.  Please make sure you don't forget your club card.  Or you will have to deal with Hitler attitude cashier."}
{"text":"This was our first Las Vegas buffet experience and Red Rock Casino did not disappoint. On this particular Friday night, we waited about 30 mins to pay and be seated, but the line was managed efficiently.   Entering the buffet we were impressed by the variety of food options which catered to several different cuisines. There were no lines at food stations and all items were stocked and plentiful. The barbecue and American stations really stood out. The dessert station primarily featured gelato and several varieties of cream pies, sliced on demand. As another yelper previously mentioned, the woman behind the gelato counter was sassy but we found her unintentionally delightful.   The cost ($22) was well worth the experience, however the prime rib, which distinguishes this buffet from others, ended up being pretty forgettable."}
{"text":"Don't come here if you have children. You will pay the same price as if they were an adult. The hostess was incredibly rude. Food was decent. Be careful in words in their  prices. \"$12.99 and up\" for the buffet. You get to the register and now you paying 15.99. I hate trickery. Pretty desperate if you ask me..."}
{"text":"The food is great, the price is just right.. My wife is so picky she hates buffets.. But for a reason... She loves this place... We have been to many places and this beats... Alot of the places..."}
{"text":"I wish there was a review less than a star. I ate here this evening and will never go back. I had the catfish and it had its guts still inside. It was disgusting. I talked with the manager and they said its how it comes."}
{"text":"Buffet was GREAT but the managers' attitude SUCKS !!! They need to retrain in Customer Service."}
{"text":"I'd eat here every Sunday if I lived in the area.  The brunch was perfect and what we were looking for. Mimosas included! Plenty of items to choose from. The casino is an added bonus... our lucky place."}
{"text":"Amazing deal this buffet. Staff is attentive and always around. Me and my boyfriend went there around 1pm and we didn't have to wait more than 3 minutes.The food is delicious and you have so many choices !! I would recommend not to eat for the day if you plan on going there so you can actually enjoy a lot of food. Only negative point is my boyfriend got a coke and while he was drinking we realized the glass was awfully dirty..eww... It was really disappointing to see that especially because we were enjoying the food so much.  But there is such a large choice of food and very tasty that I will go back again and definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best breakfast buffet for only 4.99 which includes drinks, same price as a combo meal but a lot more selection and better quality food."}
{"text":"i went there for lunch. With my reward card the price went down from $13.99 to $9.99. The food was just ok. i should have gone to M. But the service was good. My server was very nice to us."}
{"text":"Being that I LoVe food and Awesome people... I thank God I found Feast Buffet at the Red Rock Casino. They have pretty much everything you're looking for!  The salad bar is to die for! The Turkey and dressing makes me Soooo home sick! From the Great prices to the sweet girls at the front who check you in, to the host who seats you, to the server who serves you...everyone has a smile and treats you fabulous. What I think is super cool... is that every kitchen has their own chef! I highly recommend the Feast Buffet to anyone visiting or living here in Las Vegas. Not to mention when you're done eating, there's a movie theater and bowling alley in the Red Rock Casino!! Yoo-Hooooo!!!"}
{"text":"Well this was the buffet that took my virginity since it was the first one I went to in Vegas.  I was very impressed by the décor and the size.  I thought the price was reasonable and the service was fast.  The main items I enjoyed were the Sushi, Carving Station and the Deserts were incredible because of the gelato.  This is a great place and will always be on my list for the best buffet in Summerlin.   P.S. DO NOT GO DURING LUNCH because it will be packed with people who think EATING IS A SPORT and get  Competitive to finish everything before you get to it LMAO."}
{"text":"The long lines and poor management is not worth the wait for average food for this local and his wife. I now remember why we stopped coming to Red Rock."}
{"text":"I came in from Summerlin several times to try out the Feast Buffet, they open at 8 in the morning.  The cashier line moves fairly fast but that's about it.  The stations for breakfast are slow if not missing items. We would wait and wait and wait walking back and forth until the tray is put into place. Why? You take money at 8, right away but we are left waiting to eat with an unprepared kitchen staff.  Not right.  Get it together Feast! This is part of the station casino systems,  not small,  but fairly large but they act like this is all new to them.  Losing customers and bad reviews would be the normal thing here. Avoid this place.  Red Rock is way better."}
{"text":"The line wasn't too long so that's always a good thing. It's a small buffet area. I found the variety of food pretty good. The desserts section could be a little better (more variety) but it was okay. Our waiter was awesome...very friendly and on top of it. I'd go back to this spot and its very reasonable for dinner...no more than $8.00."}
{"text":"Excellent value.  They have everything for breakfast... Meats, eggs, country fried steak, donut bar, the list goes on."}
{"text":"The wait to get in for lunch is ridiculous at 1:30. There was only 1 cashier and she just walked off. Finally someone showed upto help."}
{"text":"Dear Menu Decision Makers of the Green Valley Feast Buffet:  It almost brings a tear to my eye having to determine if you are now a \"Meh. Ive experienced better\" or now an A-OK in my book.  I opted to go with the A-OK because me and you go way back.  For those that know me I am a simple girl with simple taste buds and I do not seek out those razzle dazzle fancy pants buffets that most enjoy.  That is why I thought we had a good thing going here Feast Buffet.  I mean you are always sending me coupons telling me you like me and want me to come back for a visit.  That is why I can not understand for the life of me why you have replaced your mac and cheese (my favorite item) on your menu with \"chili mac and cheese\".  The first time this impostor mac and cheese and I came into contact it took my breath away, and not in a good way.  I immediately became panicked and it through off my entire routine.  After I calmed down and collected my thoughts I tried to give you the benefit of the doubt and think maybe you had some ingredients you needed to use up so you decided to through the kitchen sink into the simplest staple item on any decent buffet.   Fast forward to our next encounter.  The chili mac and cheese is still there and now it looks like it has a permanent home.  I don't know what to do.  At this point I have told my husband you and I are through until you get your act together.  No one likes chili mac and cheese.. what is this a family reunion?  Take a look at the pot, there is usually one poor soul who has taken a scoop of this nonsense because they are either color blind and doesn't notice the mac and cheese now has a horrible burnt sienna hue to it or maybe just feels bad that no one else is eating it.   This is a test of our friendship Feast Buffet.  The ball is in your court."}
{"text":"To my understanding, buffets fashion all you can eat and all you can drink. Even if it isn't true for the drink part, I would expect a glass of water with every plate of food.  As of now I've finished one plate of breakfast food, one plate of fruit and got a third dish with just a bagel hoping that my server brings me something to drink.  A porter just cleared my table of empty plates and cups and still no maintenance visit for a refresh on my drinks.  This is the second time in two days that I've gotten really bad service from the brand that used to be the best for employment. It doesn't look like people who work here now like their job anymore. Btw, I'm still waiting for my drinks. The manager and host I had reminded before I got my fruits, probably also don't care. I'm also dropping my two star review to one, because it looks like I'm not gonna get my glass of tap water."}
{"text":"lunch is usually around $17 which is totally worth it. its a buffet that i can rely on the quality of the food. i usually eat the  -roast beef (always perfectly cooked the way i like, slightly pink) -creamed corn -cal zones (love, love, love them, stuffed w spinach, pepperoni, and     cheese) -FULL GELATO BAR! -soups  but the perfect time to go is towards the end of breakfast and beginning of lunch, so you get the best of both worlds. YUM! and its a great deal because you pay for the brkfst price."}
{"text":"I've been to the Feast buffet at Red Rock a few times for work events and enjoyed it so I took my friend to this one since it was closer when he was in town.  Talk about a bad idea.  It was seafood night and everything was either too salty or too greasy.  Both of us got sick afterwards....1 bathroom for my friend, 1 for me, and 1 as a sanctuary.  Sorry big D, next time we'll spend the extra cash and try one on the Strip."}
{"text":"This Buffet was good depending on what you get. We paid around 7 bucks per person for breakfast. The price goes up depending what time of day you go. I went around Brunch time as they were changing out the food from breakfast to lunch. They have sections like international, sushi, american, asian, pastries etc. The breakfast / lunch was delicious, so much to choose from. Some things were definitely bland but overall it was good.   Round one was waffles, sausage, bacon, hash browns and chilaquiles. The shredded hash browns were good but the oval one I got was stale, i'm guessing because it was sitting there for awhile. The waffle was a bit hard. The chilaquiles were better than i expected. The bacon was delicious. The sausage not so much.   Round two was a pizza slice, mac n cheese, some steak meat, fried rice, fried pork, some noodles, and I forgot what else. so much! The pizza was alright. The steak meat looked good but didn't appeal to my taste buds when I took the first and last bite. The mac and cheese was mediocre. I enjoyed the chinese food more so than the rest. The fried pork was good.   The desert round included some fruit, cookies and a cinnamon roll. It was all good and there is nothing to complain about.   I wish i had the stomach capacity to try everything. What I got was only 40% of what they offer.   The one thing I didn't like was waiting on the water to bring me a refill of soda. I mean it's a buffet, why not have the soft drinks available right there as well?   I also overheard a lot of elderly folk saying their table was too far from the buffet, which can be an issue for the elderly or disabled but I didn't have a problem with that.   I do recommend this place. Everyone's taste is different. I happen to be sort of a picky eater."}
{"text":"I like the place I had a coupon and the girl at the counter made it seem like she was trying her best for us not to use it until she found it so our coupon wasn't accepted :( I mean it was valid will try using it another time. Because I had much better service from them before"}
{"text":"Then Feast was great! We all ate so much we just about had to be wheel chaired out of the place! I recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"If you like your breakfast, cold, dry, bland or super salty then this is the place for you! Very little options subpar customer service and the coffee is terrible.  I guess you get what you pay for. ($6)  looking for a decent place for breakfast this isn't it."}
{"text":"Worst ever buffet today. Valentines day \"Special\" charged extra for extended menu. Only one extra desert, a cupcake the size of a quarter! Manager could have cared less when we complained! We are locals that will not be back. Good luck on ripping us locals off!"}
{"text":"Love this buffet. When we lived in Rhodes Ranch we used to get coupons in the mail all the time for a buy one get one free (with player's card). Never had breakfast or lunch there, only dinner. Never had a bad experience.  SERVICE: I LOVE their iced tea, (not sure if it's fresh brewed or not), and I will literally drink at least 7 glasses of it throughout my meal.  Servers almost always replace my tea without me asking, and before it's completely finished. Friendly and prompt service. Dirty plates always removed promptly.   FOOD: A great selection (in my opinion), and a lot to choose from for vegetarians.  This is important to me since I am one. Constantly putting fresh food out. (I've been to buffets where you can tell the food has been sitting out for a long time.) Not a huge selection of desserts, but I'm not a fan of sweets anyway, so doesn't bother me. They do offer gelato, however, (in addition to the chocolate/vanilla soft serve machine), that's really good!  ATMOSPHERE: Always very clean.  It's really close to slot machines, so it is fairly noisy. But hey, it's a casino, it's to be expected.    Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Line was super long then found out it's only $9.99 per person if you have a players club card so ended up paying 16.99 per person. It was $9.99 for my 3 and 4 yr old. The food was only subpar and the set up was stupid."}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet I have been to in 20 years of living in Vegas. Everything was cold and there wasn't much variety of good food. The service was awful too. I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite buffets.  The food is great especially the salmon.  There is such a huge variety of food.  Definitely something for everyone.  The staff is so helpful too.    We came on Easter and they were quick to help us due to my medical situation right now."}
{"text":"Two stars only because of the food besides that the \"server\" was the worst got the drink order so wron took nearly the end then continually made us to blame then came and said put yourself In my shoes well lady \"Elvia (her name)\" I am a server as well. I told her I do everything she does and more! Her only job is to get drinks and bus tables that's it and for continually say she was \"one of the best\" that's just sad. Horrible experience because of her."}
{"text":"IMO, this is by far the best buffet on the east side.  We have eaten at the buffets at Sam's Town and Eastside Cannery, and of the three, Boulder Station's Feast Buffet easily beats the other two.  The carving station is top quality with several options and large cuts. The soup and salad bar are great. There is a cook to order pasta bar. There are fish and shrimp options on the regular buffet, but they are just ok. The desserts were also very good. Overall, excellent buffet and we will be frequenting it."}
{"text":"An incredible selection of food to choose from for an insanely small amount of money (with your station card) that just can't be beat. Service is wonderfully pleasant with staff that have truly warm smiles and are attentive and friendly. I was impressed and I am not usually easy to please."}
{"text":"I used to eat here alot of times since 2014. The service is getting worse and worse each time I go there. The lady who served our table terribly and THE LADY at the ICE CREAM CORNER had attitude on me. She was very rude and I feel like I'm Insulted. I was in the line and asked for coffee Gelato but then she goes sneer at me had deep breathe \" sigh....! O.k. sweetheart. You guys don't mind Right? \" I was like what is going on \" I was on the line\" and she sneeer and said \" I know sweetheart you was.\" I wanted to say something but I just left. I should have called supervisor that I don't know what I did to her.  She had BLONd bang, African American. I feel Insulted"}
{"text":"We have stopped eating here as almost every dish is poorly repaired, displayed and doesn't have ant taste. Forget about ever getting a refill of your drink. Be prepared that once you get to the head of the waiting line to maybe wait another 10 minutes even though the buffet is only half full. Can't understand the wait EVERY time we came here. Couldn't believe the amount of animals eating off their plates while getting food and putting their spit on the serving spoons."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation of a work associate during a business trip. The hot tip is to sign up for Station Casino's \"Boarding Pass\" players club card [free] I saved $5 off of dinner buffet with players card and since the sign up gave me free slot play, I used it on my way out and won $8 bucks, so my dinner cost $5.99 [normal price is $18.99]  Considering that the cost was so minimal, it was a good value. I normally dont like buffets, but not totally opposed to them. This one is not one of the better buffets, it's typical of most average buffets.   The food I liked best here was from the Italian station \"Stromboli\""}
{"text":"The service staff is usually friendly but not always.   The food is just OK .   The salad bar needs to be maintained more often.   The menu items have been cut back.  I haven't seen decent vegetable is months.  It's just not what it was.  They are cutting back too much to spite their own face."}
{"text":"First of all I LOVE that my parents are in town right now. It means I get to go out to eat ... and they pay!   (love it) My mom has been wanting to go to GVR for the buffet for days - and I have had a little cold and haven't felt like doing much, but relented and went last night.  SO glad that I did. :) First stop CRAB - plated it and handed it to the nice lady behind the grill where she grilled it with tomato,garlic, thai chile, butter and cilantro.  Messy but so freaking good that you can't help but eat til you make your self sick  I also got some shrimp done this way... kind of a spicy shrimp scampi if you will.  They had some Oktoberfest foods on the line ... pretzels with mustard sauce (pretzel good sauce sucked)  red cabbage, brats and sauerkraut.  fun times. For some reason I only allow myself to have a small amount of potatos here ( normally I don't eat them at all) but there is something about them and the turkey gravy that satiates a need.  We got there about 4 pm and the line moved fast.  Enjoyed the food and our server was phenomenal - if you put your plate to the side it was gone before you could blink. ( can she come work at my house please I am adopting) GREAT meal soooo delish ..  Yes I will be back ... again and again ... and again."}
{"text":"This was one of the best buffets I have had in a while. I am a frequent visitor here to a lot of the buffets locally and this one stands out. On the recommendation from a friend I came here for breakfast and was not disappointed. It was a little pricey but the location, selection and atmosphere make it worth it. A lot of the local casino buffets lack variety but I was happy with our selection. As a Christian father of two it is hard to keep my kids happy. If you go to the omelette bar make sure Erica H. is the one cooking for you. She was more than happy to deal with my rowdy kids and also is quick at serving with no issues with my odd requests. You don't usually see this level of service in a Vegas buffet. Especially at a locals casino. I don't write reviews often but I was impressed with pretty much everything about this place that I will for sure be back.   Thanks, you all rock!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite buffet in Vegas, quality is there and also service is great. What makes it even better - you can't beat the price for the quality offered."}
{"text":"Great buffet. I always go here if I bring people to Vegas. It's only $12 for dinner if you show your players card...which is free. Great variety of food and desserts. Its as good as the buffets on the strip...maybe even better since it's so cheap for the same quality. Its a local buffet also so no annoying young people screaming and being drunk. All around good buffet for price and quality."}
{"text":"Basic buffet food, with good prime rib. Thanks to our pleasant and efficient server, Kim, we were well supplied with drink refills. Overall, it was worth it, with something for all four of us.  Recommend signing up with the club, to get the discount."}
{"text":"Stood in line for over 1 hour at the Palace Station location on January 14, 2018 @ 1 pm. Upon being seated as a hungry customer, we noticed that we were missing a fork. So we kindly went looking around for one, but to no success. So we found a server named \"Julia\" who just so happen to have a bunch of clean utensils in hand. Asked her if we could have one of her forks, cause we were missing one. She refused & said that we needed to ask OUR server & not her. I told her that we were yet to see our server & that we were hungry due to waiting in line for over 1 hour. At this point, she finally reluctantly gave us a fork, but scolded us about it. I immediately asked for her name & inform her that she shouldn't treat paying customers that way."}
{"text":"This buffet is located inside the Green Valley Ranch Hotel, this is the 3rd time we've had cold food for the Breakfast Buffett. Today is Monday am and $9.99 per person, they open at 8. Everything is presented nicely, got 1 small pancake, 1 small waffel, 2 sausage links, and the worst looking runny and not even cooked scrambled eggs. I stirred them up and took some from around the outer banks. We ordered coffee and small milk brought to the table. Told our waiter we had a complaint, he went and got the floor manager, Jack. Showed him the uncooked eggs, and how cold items were. No sorry, but he said he would check. Never returned, we took another plate and went back to get other items, so disturbed, saw Mgr. Jack, said oh ya just need to stir the eggs, I said how unappealing to see cups of liquid through out eggs..... especially eww. We went got a bagel toasted, fresh fruit and called it a horrible experience for the 3rd time. We live here and it is unacceptable. Plus Jack did not offer a comp for the $17.98 we paid nor the tip we always leave. Shame on you GVR....clean up your act!!!!"}
{"text":"The buffet was okay I would rather go for breakfast or for dinner came here for brunch and it wasn't really that great it seems that they took out a lot of items and replaced them with healthier options which might be good for other people but not me LOL I happen to use my boarding pass points and I'm kind of glad I did so I didn't have to pay for the buffet all on all I would return here only for dinner or breakfast though, they need more meatier options during lunch"}
{"text":"Overall a good buffet, I love the selection good variety. I really liked that they had caprese salad as an option on the salad bar..you dont really see that. The desserts were designed sooo cute instead of just slopping pie slices on a plate. The staff was friendly, just wish our server had been around a little more but it is a buffet."}
{"text":"Stay away from expensive buffet (Feast buffet, Palace station, Las Vegas) for low class eating in all department. very bad quality food,no flavor (like public hospital) all boiled and dry, even the buffet smiles greasy, tables sticky, the creamy shrimp alfredo  was watery and no shrimp!! you have to wait until they load a few very small shrimps!!! desert serial or few kind of dry cake or peanut butter cookies. they bring you the drinks then you have to wait for a while for the straw , then wait for another time for a napkins. very bad service!! the steak dry and no flavor. was very bad experience i never back again, not too much to choices!!!"}
{"text":"Food is ok. Place is nice and spacious for families.You get what you pay for. It wasn't bad at all but lacked flavor in some foods."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch $12.99 and an hour and a half later we were finally seated!  Longest wait EVER considering we went there for breakfast and didn't even get seated till after noon. We ordered 2 $.99 Margaritas - they couldnt get the machine to work because it was frozen so refunded our money.  Off to a good start already.  We all scurried to get our food as we were all starved.  Had we known the wait would be that long we probably would have gone somewhere else.  This place is a typical everyday boring buffet.  It seemed everything I chose was hard as a rock - rolls, pizza, potstickers....just simply not consumable...and being that the place was so busy you wouldn't think anything would be there long enough to get hard.  Dumbfounded. The sausage gravy had instead of ground sausage had 3 inch chunks of linked breakfast sausage.  It seemed so wrong and gross.  Ugh.  Not even to mention the gravy needed stirred...bad.  I went up to the meat counter where the guy was slicing the meat for people.  I asked for turkey and he slapped a piece of completely uneatable raw bloody prime rib right in the middle of my plate.  Thanks for listening Mr. Man.  I guess I should pay better attention or else he should.  The waitress was pleasant though.  The company was great.  The food not so much....I'm giving a one star to the 1/2 of a donut I indulged in at the end.  I do remember now why I don't do buffets and I definitely wont be waiting in line for one anytime soon."}
{"text":"The Buffet is Pretty good and the price is not bad. Service is good, Big dining area, sometimes a little crowded. Food wise, you have a big selection -  Crab legs you can have seasoned  the way you like, a Mongolian Grill type the has beef, chicken, Pork, Kalbi beef ( I saw someone get a full plate of just Kalbi -Korean style marinated rib beef). Good amounts of seafood and a big carving station and Lots of desserts...Alot of food and the price wasn't bad at all...."}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet a couple of times previous when it was Station's Feast Buffet.  This was my first trip since the ownership changed.  This review is based upon a lunchtime visit.  The buffet was nice and clean and the wait staff were very friendly.  Now, for the food........  I'll start with what I thought was decent.  Most of the salad bar is just fine; there could be an expansion of the salad toppings and that would be a plus, but no real complaints here.  I did think the cold broccoli salad was pretty good.  Also, the selection of gelato is quite nice and tasty.  Now, for what definitely needs improvement:  The majority of the hot items are similar to what you would find in a high school cafeteria.  Seasoning is not in the cooking staff's vocabulary.  There are too many items that are deep fried and that just does not have a long holding time and hence the quality suffers.    All in all, I think I probably discarded 3 full plates of food that just wasn't worth eating.\  I still felt like I got my money's worth by taking a couple of trips through the cold salad bar and a number of plates from the dessert bar."}
{"text":"What can I say except...home town buffet.  This used to be a great buffet, what happened.  We always ate here when in town but everything that made it great is long gone...I will try another buffet next time and urge you to do the same if you haven't been in awhile.  Gone is the seafood, crab, customer service and overall taste...still here is the $20pp charge for Sunday buffet."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on a Monday. The place was not busy at all. The food was far from spectacular. We used points from the players card to pay for our buffet. Thank goodness because the  food was horrendous. I would never pay for this buffet with my own money. The service was great other than that this buffet just like the establishment its built-in,is on a downward spiral into.the toilet."}
{"text":"Not good. Food is old. See picture of soup. Yuck  Had to sneak photo staff was rude at best. I do have to say Meatloaf was good."}
{"text":"Five stars for the service, accommodation, friendly staff and food.   I contacted Bonnie from Medley Buffet at Aliante Casino. She gave me a good price and assured that me and my 17 guests will be accommodated... They did! Two thumbs up for the Medley Buffet team.  So, if you're planning a get together and don't want the hassle of cooking, planning, cleaning, etc.... just give these guys a call and they will help you out."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday for lunch and it was just ok... It used to be better before but I don't know what happened. I never saw our server. I thought the guy busing tables was him but no one ever greeted us. They were in the middle of shift change while we were in line, and they seemed like they didn't really know what was going on. Their was at least 10 different employees standing around the cashier booth. With the manager yelling for someone. Will definitely be back and try it again. I was disappointed that they no longer carry crab legs. That was the best!"}
{"text":"We had lunch at GVR today, waited almost an hour in line since they sent out 2 for 1 buffet coupons to station club card holders recently. The food selection & quality was good for the price $9.99 lunch buffet w/ club card, children 2 & under are free.  The mapo dubu (tofu in a mild chili sauce) in the chinese food area was pretty good & the salad bar was fresh.  I'd say the buffet was better than The Silverton when they have promos going on but not as good as the buffet at Red Rock Resort, another station casino.  I'd be happy to come again for lunch but not during promos, waiting an hour for lunch is a little much especially w/ our 3yr old."}
{"text":"All the buffets at the various Station buffets are not equal. The food offerings at the Feast Buffet at the Palace Station are no where near as extensive or as well prepared as the buffet at Boulder Station or Sunset Station even though the prices are all the same. So if you are thinking of eating here, instead consider the buffet at one of Station's other properties."}
{"text":"We ate at 3 buffets during our Las Vegas trip and this was my favorite.  I feel like the super popular buffets on the strip try to make each dish very unique....which is fun but some foods are downright unusual or oddly prepared.  Feast does it just right...everything is very good and tastes as you would expect...pasta dishes, soups, meats, mashed potatoes, etc.  This buffet is also more reasonably priced then some and in a stunning location.  My favorite was the mini creme brulee...amazing!"}
{"text":"This buffet is good.  Excellent with the 2 for 1 coupon in the Las Vegas Review Journal which recently started up again for buffets monday to thursday.  This is just as good as red rock station without the long drive, and better than Aliante Station (except for thursday night steak night).  Prime rib is excellent with a wide array of desserts.  Seafood night has shrimp and oysters.  I don't remember what else they had in terms of seafood.  Staff is always friendly and clear your plate so you're ready for more.  Gelato is good and so are the pastries.    It's just as good as red rock station buffet, and a little cheaper."}
{"text":"This buffet used to be really great.  There have been some major cutbacks.  The sushi now only consists of rolls, no more sashimi, they stopped at the beginning of this year, I asked because I was very surprised and then disappointed.  Also, for seafood night, there are NO crab legs, what the frak?  and you call this seafood night?  basically the only seafood is several varieties (i mean differently seasoned), shell your own shrimp, cold clams (decent), and semi dried up fresh oysters.  Seafood night is Friday night.  Desserts are ok.  they have gelato, but now you have to ask the service person there to get  a slice of pie for you.  you can't pick your own anymore.  They also tried making some cupcakes, they are mini, hard, and tasteless.  The only flavoring comes from the sugar of the frosting and sprinkles.    A way better deal is to just give this place a try on a weekday night, at least you still get prime rib, and in the Las Vegas REview Journal (our local las vegas newspaper), there is a coupon for a 2 for 1 buffet at any of the station casino buffets or Fiesta buffets.  If you are only only person, it gives you half off your dinner.  Only downside, is that it is not combinable with the station rewards card to get $2 off your meal for dinner or $1 off for lunch/breakfast.  It is worth the $.75 to get a newspaper to save the $15 for dinner Monday thru Thursday."}
{"text":"We went to the Palace Station's Feast Buffet during their Wednesday 50 plus 1/2 point dining promotion.  We earned some extra points during January's Point Giveaway so we used our Boarding Pass and got two free dinner buffets. On most nights you would pay $8 each for the buffet and we've done that many times.  You can't really beat that price which includes a beverage.  They can't compare to a Strip Buffet but they aren't trying to, and people shouldn't expect the same quality and selection.  You aren't paying $30 per person or more either. There's plenty of choices on the buffet line and also the made-to-order pasta line that's super.  The Staff was friendly and quick to remove plates and refill drinks. The long line at the entrance shows that the bad reviewers are in the minority."}
{"text":"The food at this buffet is pretty good and the waiters are on top of it the only problem about this buffet is that they have the window open without glass so you can smell all of the cigarette smoke while eating which is very unpleasant."}
{"text":"I love bringing my little brothers here for lunch because it has a little something for all of us! And they are extremely picky with there food! They always have great service here and you will never see an empty cup of soda/water!"}
{"text":"It's a good value for an average breakfast or lunch. The décor is actually very upscale-looking and the atmosphere is a little more relaxing than some of its sister casinos. Lunch here is fairly standard with Mexican, Italian, American, and some Asian specialties. For less than $10 you can satisfy your breakfast or lunch appetite with a variety of okay-quality items. The place was filled with customers but fairly quiet when I was here for lunch - many seniors. Counter cleanliness could use some improvement. Table service was okay. Desserts were average but there were many choices. This buffet should consider upgrading its offerings and draw customers willing to pay a little more for greater choices and better quality. Access is easy. I'd stop here again for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Impressive experience here for lunch. I've been here for breakfast before but not for lunch until now. The place was very busy with an almost festive atmosphere. Cashiers, floor workers, and counter workers were very congenial. Table service was very good. My server was especially active in taking good care of her tables. Tables and floors were kept clean - not an easy task with small kids and teeting/tottering seniors. Food counters were kept clean and organized. It's a \"meat and potatoes buffet with a decent food selection and a few specialty items.   The turkey at the carving station was moist and tender and the best tasting turkey I've ever had at a buffet. I'd return here anytime for breakfast or lunch - outstanding value, good food, and a staff that seems to work well together. This place looks extremely popular with families. I've been here four or five times in the past year and it seems improved each time. Watch out for long lines at prime meal times."}
{"text":"This buffet still has the facilities to pull off some unique offerings. It may not be gourmet here but you can certainly satisfy your lunch (and probably breakfast) appetite with an average variety of fairly good-tasting items for less the $10. Barbequed foods are one specialty but probably more so for dinner. Chili is excellent. Asian foods seem to miss the mark; Hispanic foods - not bad. The lunch atmosphere is very busy and somewhat noisy. Table service was okay. I usually eat three buffet meals a day when I visit Las Vegas - so I'm just looking for a moderate, fast lunch with multiple choices. I'd stop here again at breakfast or lunch times if nearby."}
{"text":"Went to the \"Feast Buffet\" @ Sunset Station for what they advertised as a \"Mother's Day Champagne Bruch\". I Called on Saturday to find out what hours the \"Champagne Brunch\"actually ended.  I was told \"All Day\"...I said Champagne Brunch ALL DAY? They said \"YES. ..8AM -9PM MOTHER'S DAY CHAMPAGNE BRUNCH\". So we got the abou 4pm..waited in line for about 45 minutes. When we were sat & I ordered Champagne they said \"There is no champagne.\" This is after paying over $100 for 3 adults & 2 minors. The waiter said they were out...\" no more\". I Then asked the front entrance staff who said champagne ends at 4pm. The HUGE sign in the front of the Buffet ALSO said Mother's Day  Champagne Brunch...all day. I then asked yo speak to a manager. ..told him my issue..he walked up to the huge sign & said. ..\"Champagne ends at 4.\"  The sign is wrong. It ALWAYS ENDES AT 4\". I then pointed out that it was a HOLIDAY/MOTHERS DAY & told him I had called ahead as well, and was told \"Mother's Day Champagne Brunch all day...he wanted to know THE NAME of who I talked to. Then he was making up excuses as he went.             1. IT'S 17.99 ANYWAY            2. THE CHAMPAGNE IS                 COMPLIMENTARY..NOT INCLUDED                IN THE PRICE. (  WHAT !??)            3. THE SIGN IS WRONG.            4. YOU COULD'VE TALKED TO A \"MAIN HUB\"...whatever that means..they addressed me by name when I called Sunset Station..so Not a hub..jerk. So hear I am \"The Mom on Mother's day\" getting the \"Too bad for you...go away attitude.\" By now my husband had realized what's going on and also want's an explanation.  The same clueless bald guy manager comes over so we asked for HIS manager...so here comes another guy spouting the same REHEARSED EXCUSES..didn't care AT ALL about us,  our problem...NOTHING. I  told them and now I am telling all of you. I will NEVER go back to The Feast Buffet at SUNSET STATION. We came for a special day and I was do upset at how we were treated that I could BARELY eat. The food was s 4 out of 10. The selection 3 out of 10. The waiters & waitresses are the best thing about this place.  But something tells me from the way we were treated that they probably aren't treated great either. Bottom line here. I got 2 glasses of Champagne that were very readonable & tasted for good $ 3.74 each.....BUT it's the point that they advertise one thing...get you there and then say. ..basically. ..YES, WE MADE S MISTAKE,  WE ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT RIGHT & TO BAD! YOU ALREADY PAID! VERY POOR MANAGEMENT."}
{"text":"Food was terrific. For $5 you can't eat anywhere like the breakfast here.  Had the scrambled eggs. They were from a carton so they always seem to have that strange texture. Could also use some seasoning. I could have asked the omelet bar to make me a couple of eggs, but I didn't. The bacon was just ok. Stuck together (baked) so I ended up with more than I really wanted. Sausages were good. Biscuits and gravy were average. Shredded hash browns were average too. Had a jelly donut for desert. Same quality as a convenience store donut.   Ok for a cheap breakfast."}
{"text":"As we drove from Hoover Dam back towards Vegas, I saw the sign for Sunset Station and remembered reading about the buffet, so I decided to stop here for lunch.   Large buffets in and around Las Vegas are numerous and this was no exception. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feast-buffet-henderson-7?select=P04-AN-OEFvVa0iE1hXaxA  PRICE: On the Friday afternoon we stopped in, lunch was $13 ($12.99) each.  If you sign up for their \"players card\" (free and only takes a couple minutes) that saves you $3 on each person on your group!   SERVICE: Pay as you enter, no surprise there.  One thing I found interesting, they asked if I wanted to include the tip now, or leave it at the table.  I never had that option before.  You are then escorted to a table and are then free to attack the buffet.  Our server was very nice and quickly filled our drink order.  Though he only checked on us once after that initial visit.  Most of the staff manning the buffet stations were pleasant enough, but the woman at the \"carving station\" must have been having a bad day, as she had an attitude and didn't try to hide it!  FOOD: Like most buffets, there's a good variety of items to choose from: An American station with a hand carved meat station. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feast-buffet-henderson-7?select=E1RqKgfXm_n5LmlbDcBFgg https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feast-buffet-henderson-7?select=YHEoyQTG6vo6Dsmvn3N8MA  An \"International\" station. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feast-buffet-henderson-7?select=biMjKMGodPBeGBbgJf7CnQ  Italian & Asian choices too. https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feast-buffet-henderson-7?select=MPd_RFAgP39eaFWpv7YKGQ  Last but not least, the dessert station with a variety to choose from, including some amazing gelato! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feast-buffet-henderson-7?select=3LiGA_MOV2IaMugasLqdmQ https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feast-buffet-henderson-7?select=HruLYRYtH4_OB9nCdbaYEg https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/feast-buffet-henderson-7?select=sEdhwChoJMI239gNJvBPng  OVERALL: This is not a high-end buffet like you'll find on the Strip in Las Vegas, but that's OK for me.  Most things were good, some were bland and \"meh\", unfortunately a couple things I tried were \"OMG horrible\", specifically the beef brisket, WAY overcooked, dry, chewy and flavorless, UGH!   But then for the price point, I shouldn't expect too much, should I?   Should I???  3 stars A-OK for this one."}
{"text":"Very good and tasty buffet for the price.  You can spend a lot more than this in Las Vegas for mediocre buffet.  The Asian section was great - Pad Thai, and many excellent Japanese, Korean, Thai and Chinese dishes.  The sushi was below average with tiny amounts of fish rolled up in lots of rice.  The dessert bars were good, you have to ask for some of the pies and things behind the counter and I am glad we did, the coconut cream pie, and the little chocolate cups filled with mango cream were awesome.  We went on a Sunday night at dinnertime and there was a 45 minute wait in line in the way-too-smoky casino.  We'll be back though!"}
{"text":"once again I went in expecting better,  nope.  Didn't happen. They should fire the fat head cook that walks around early and doesn't do anything! Head cook of what?! Mediocrity?!  I know it's Vegas but the expectations are high,  the cooks and staff should not be high in their jobs and stay sober,  at least until the customers are better feed,  yo."}
{"text":"beautiful cheerful room. outstanding desserts - try the mini cupcakes! prime rib not bad. pork verde good. one notch below village buffet at paris and 40% cheaper ( 17 not 25). dollar off with slot card too. best of all, had good luck with high limit slots afterwards!!"}
{"text":"Sorry but this rating isn't for the food. Somebody in this establishment during breakfast, stole my \"Mommy Clip\" from my children's stroller that we parked near the cashier station where people pay and wait to be seated.  Every mommy out there who knows what a \"Mommy Clip\" is can attest to how important this gadget is to our stroller and overall sanity. I approached the casino security and was told basically that they don't give a rat's ass about stolen property or \"Missing property\" as they call anything stolen in their facility. They only look at surveillance video for gaming issues. NIIIIICE!!!!!! So if you're getting raped in the corner, nobody will care. UGH!!! anyway, thanks for reading my rant."}
{"text":"Place is pretty good but found a long piece of hair in my coconut cream pie. Since I am pretty bald it's not mine and the guys serving gun behind the display have short hair and hats not sure how long it was there.  Always check your food before eating."}
{"text":"This is an enjoyable buffet. I feel like for a locals buffet it is a little on the pricey side compared with other Vegas buffets however the food is fine and it is a very large buffet. Wish they had a seafood night, a real seafood night, like a lot of other casinos do."}
{"text":"For such a big operation it took the Host 15 minutes to seat my party of 6.  It set the wrong tone to have them move us to the side, literally, and continually seat 12 other parties ahead of us.  I guess it IS really hard to push two tables together, which is what they ended up doing.  The wait staff seemed overworked.  Drinks came VERY slowly, which is disappointing when you consider that is half of their job.. drinks and busing the tables.  They had a good range of food in their salad bar and the carving stations in the 'American' section.  were good.  Desserts were average at best."}
{"text":"This buffet wasn't all the great. Food was alright I can defiantly cook better. Only cool thing was the ice cream in the case. Mexican food sucked. Pizza was alright. Mac & cheese flavorless. Don't waist your money eat at the cafe."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Las Vegas. The food is tasty, wide array of choices and an unbeatable price of $6.99.  I couldn't understand how some casinos with less food to offer charge four times more for four times less. My family enjoyed our eats and treats!"}
{"text":"Food was average, but considering we had two for one it was just okay.  However, we won't be going back.  The Buffett had a very unpleasant dirty stink to it.  Floors filthy with dropped food, and trash every where but the trash can.  Strong odor of cigarette smoke drifting up to dining area.  Been there many times, but no more, even with a deal.  If it was for free, the wife and I agree no thanks."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.  Went for breakfast with the wife today.  We took advantage of locals deal for two.  Buffett cost us $6.48 including tax.  Clean areas, nice and cool, and simple food stations kept well stocked.  Eggs Benedict, hash browns, sausages, bacon, corn beef hash, egg/omelette station, Mexican breakfast, fresh fruits, cereals, yogurt, pastries and donuts plus much more.  Very satisfying meal and great price, even with out locals bogo."}
{"text":"Worst buffet  , food was old looking like it has been out for hours  ,desserts were so hard I could bang them on the plate and they didn't even crack.  It is cheap so I guess you get what you pay for"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here, gotta say the omelette they make is pretty good and you can have it anyway you like. Apple cobbler was a bit on the sweet side buy very addicting after one bite."}
{"text":"When we stay at our brother in laws place in Henderson, I always have to go to my favorite breakfast buffet in Vegas... Ceasar's? Bellagio? The M? Cosmopolitan? Wynn?... nope, I've been there and spent a lot and stayed in line a lot... but for $6.99 (?) there is more than enough for me to be satisfied... where else can you get made to order omelets, and the rest for such a low price?  And it's right down the street where we stay... I usually get there around 10am have my oatmeal... omelet... corned beef hash... one egg over easy... country gravy on everything... a couple of drinks (included of course), coffee... then stick around and have a gelato for dessert... I truly am \"buffet\" out... that's why I stay away from the Vegas Strips buffets now... especially after I did the 24 hour buffet buffet... so go the Ceasar's... and wait to get the different juices... the smoked bacon (that bacon was good by the way) and pay $40 or $50... while I get my little waffle and put strawberries from the salad bar on... and enjoy my neighborhood hang out..."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of buffets since I stuff myself after 2 to 2 1/2 (never 3) plates and then don't feel that great. For that reason and the fact that buffet food is usually mediocre, I'd rather spend my money on one plate of great food. That being said, Sunset's buffet is not bad, especially the brunch with its many selections. Also you can't beat the price of $10.99 with your player's card, which I never use. A few things I remember liking were their mashed potatoes, greens and brisket sliders. The meat at the carving station was too dry, as usual. I liked their unlimited mimosas for brunch. What a great idea!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service award goes to......Karla, cashier at the front!!! I asked for my transaction split into 2 and she ran whole transaction on my card. Never offered to fix transaction and was extremely rude towards us. Karla, while acting arrogant & discourteous, put the whole thing basically on me, the customer who does not even touch the register and had a I don't really give a crap attitude! I spend a lot of money in this casino, I am a chairman level and have never had any problems with any staff here until now that is. Very sad to say I don't ever see myself coming back here as I was truly disappointed."}
{"text":"The 4 stars are for value.  This is old Vegas when there were real food bargains.  Definitely wind through the casino and get the Player card for the discounts.  Fancy, no.  Large selection with Chef station, yes.  Best that you have a car or you'll give your savings to the taxi drivers... Many of whom are eating there too!  Does that tell you anything?"}
{"text":"The old adage is true here you really do get what you pay for, the food is ok nothing great but if you leave hungry it is your own fault,  Do not go a peak times otherwise you will be waiting a while in line, but for the price it is great value"}
{"text":"This place was great, then it sucked. Now it's great again. For low price food of better than low price quality I figure they're breaking even at best. They need the local trade to support the neighborhood market so after years of trade they found the sweet spot. It's five stars are not meant to imply an equivalence with the best restaurants but in comparison with its peers like Arizona Charles, Suncoast, the Palms and the Cannery. The food is really good enough to eat and you can still get the iconic buffet dessert-lemon meringue pie. It always takes some discipline not to over eat and be gluttonous only with thine eyes. There is enough fresh food and non- fried entries to be good on the salad and meal so you can be a little bad on the sweets."}
{"text":"It's been at least 3 years since I have been at this buffet.  It was good then and it is great now.  There wasn't much of a wait to be seated.  Good variety of food.  I like the new Well and Being Section.  The tricolored cauliflower was delicious.  Everything was fresh.  The salad bar had a great assortment of lettuce types and lots of toppings.  The carving station had  chicken turkey pork beef and sausage.  The beef was medium rare and tender.  The cooked vegetables were crisp not mushy.  I didn't eat any desserts, but they looked heavenly. Went on a 2 for 1 deal with the hubby.  We will be back."}
{"text":"tried it again but nothing has changed. food is cold and some unidentifiable! We won't be back to this buffet for a long while. the only saving grace was at least the prime rib was rare but warm."}
{"text":"If I could give a 0.. I would.  My husband our 11 year old daughter her friend and myself went to the buffet I believe the Mondsy before Thanksgiving. We arrived at 5pm.  The wait was not THAT long and our server was prompt and it went down hill from there.   90 % of the  tags THAT said what food was WHERE  missing and the other 10% were  breakfast.now BE ING A VEgatarian. That is very bad news for me.  I spoke to a manager who didn't seem to care and then as I was taking photos of the breakfast signs she came up and asked what I was doing so I explained.   Feeling frustrated at her poor excuse of why the signs were missing.  The chef had an emergency and had to leave, I called the Food and beverage director. No response for a week so I called back.  He seemed to care and asked if he could buy our next meal so I said sure. And gave him my address and repeated it.  Well a month later no free food passes. ... like promised.  And I WILL NOT EVER GO BACK. NOT ONLY because I exspected more from.a higher end Station casino but I was lied to  by the main chef.. SMH"}
{"text":"I like the food, not bad. We go here almost every Sun. Most of the time we get a really good server, especially this one man (sorry forgot his name!). But...last server we had looked like she's carrying the world on her shoulders. Didn't even crack a tiny smile, rolls her eyes all the time, and it's so obvious that she hates her job. Also the cashiers are just plain rude and my mom is a VIP, u would think you'd get a better treatment. Next time we go i'll make sure to get their names and let the higher ups know how bad they are. Not that i'd expect something to be done, lol."}
{"text":"Good slightly above average buffet. Definitely worth your money. No problem with service other than a little bit of cockyness displayed by the the guy bussing our table, when he thought he can memorize my groups order of drinks...Wrong! Use a note pad, we won't judge  you! Somethings that stuck out although not necessarily tasty were the chicken adobo and also their soulfood station that had collard greens. I've never had soulfood at a buffet and the adobo I think only at one of the northern California Indian casinos. What I enjoyed the most was broad selection of the Mexican station, i.e. They had chile verde, carnitas over tortilla chips, some type of tamales that's hard for me to describe and there \"were\" some chilecuilles that decided to run out before I got there :( next time take the sign off right away, to save me from food want agony :). Anyway they have the rest of the stuff that we've all come to expect from a buffet like this. Another problem I had and IT MIGHT NOT HAVE COME FROM THIS PLACE, was my \"run\" to the restroom when I got home. It was once and it was quick."}
{"text":"You know. Buffet's are not my style usually. But since I live out this way. I decided to go here. I must admit, the food was real! Nothing had that can and plastic bag taste you get on the strip.In fact, the food was exceptional. And tasted sooo good. Like home made! Salad bar is even perfect and not over done. Use your player club card for a discount if you want. As this place is very very low priced for a buffet. 6-8 bucks isn't bad for all you can eat, and rare in Vegas these days, I would give this 5 stars. But this place has one major draw back. Crowded. The lines are so big, it can take a 1/2 hour to 45 min for a seat. It is just too popular. I do a lot of hiking in the Red Rock area. And then having to wait almost a hour to eat after a hike? LOL! I must admit. Its worth the wait even. Thanks Red Rock! Great Food---Great Price even!!"}
{"text":"Meh...  It's a buffet.  Not too crowded on Thursday night.  Food was average.  The décor is very nice and the price is $14 of you have a players card.  $19 if you don't."}
{"text":"Went today for lunch had a good selection of food that tasted fresh & hot. Desserts were abundant and tasty the chocolate cake  was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"This was our first time here today.  This will be our only visit here.  Never again!!  It's expensive,  and the food was mediocre at best!  And even that might be giving too much credit.   There was absolutely nothing great about any of the options here!  I don't know what I was expecting,  but this buffet was boring!  The meats were dry.  The sushi tasted old.  The pizza tasted like it was lil Caesars.  Panda express has way better Asian food than this place.  The desserts were minimal hospital grade stuff.  I promise you can get the same quality food at an Arizona Charlies buffet,   and you'll save a lot of cash.    We have two receipts, because the cashier rang up one person less than we told her.  As a result when we went to go get seated, we were told we didn't pay for everyone in our party.  So we had to walk back to the cashier, and pay again.  We told them the first time exactly how many people were in our party . Their mistake, not ours.    Anywhoo......go to the Yard House in the casino or somewhere else.  Don't waste your money in this buffet"}
{"text":"Years ago Texas was the premier Station Casino for buffet eaters. Of course, with the advent of Red Rock, Green Valley and Sunset that is no longer the case.   Still, for my money, Texas is nearly on par with Red Rock and Sunset, better than Boulder and miles ahead of Palace (which should be shuttered!).   Lots of options and cheap, Texas is a \"hit or miss\" buffet for me. Different days, different chefs, its all a crap shoot, but every time I go I can fill a few plates with food I enjoy.   The host staff are very nice and the table service is more than efficient.   The big positive for me is that I rarely have to wait more than a few minutes. The long lines at Red Rock are not worth the slight upgrade in quality.   The only negative I have experienced is that the deserts seem very processed. I would bet against them being freshly made and if so they may need to rethink some recipes."}
{"text":"I think buffet's in general are difficult to review with any real sense of context. We are all so very different. Along with this are all the daily buffet variables related to work shifts, different chefs, time you arrive, special days etc.   With that said, Ill preface my review by saying that I am not the most discriminating eater. Any buffet that offers the staple \"thanksgiving dinner\" selection gets my first star. I also look for fresh pasta, different types of chicken and some good Asian dishes. Apart from this I have higher expectations for value, cleanliness, friendliness and atmosphere.   Over the last decade my love affair for everything Station has waned. I used to spend a lot of my casual dining and gambling time at one Station Casino or another. It just seems that over the years Station has opted to save money over preserving the quality of the experience.   Thankfully it seems that Sunset Station is experiencing a revival of sorts.   I have eaten at the Sunset buffet a dozen or more times over the years until I finally opted out last year after growing tired of the increasingly dull experience. I returned out of convenience this last weekend and was so surprised I came back 2 more times (and without a coupon even!).   The food was fresh, the serving areas were kept clean, and I liked everything I selected. There was even a hostess who said hello to us twice. I honestly don't remember a Station buffet in the last few years making any sort of impact on me until now.   I still think Palace is a silly after-thought of a cafeteria line that should be shuttered, Red Rock and Green Valley only makes sense with a coupon, and Boulder Station? well, ill pass. Texas is passable on most days and before now Sante Fe (after its upgrade) was normally where I cashed in my 2-for-1 deal.   Despite the commute Ill be putting Sunset on my monthly casino rotation and keep enjoying the buffet (at least until something changes again). If you haven't been back for a while you may want  to try it again for the first time :)"}
{"text":"Alway good too eat here. They improved there menu since the first time I've came here back in 2010. So I give it 5 stars. Plus we use 2/1 buffet special coupon mailed to me. Check it out."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting old food. Went there on a Sunday at 2 pm, was told it's 20 per person. Eggs were powdered, sausages old and hard as rocks, bacon floating in grease, and way too much breakfast stuff, hardly any American lunch items. I demanded my money back after one taste of the eggs and sausage.  What exactly are they charging extra for? Will never come back here. It was on par with Sunset Stations's 'feast buffet' and that's an insult."}
{"text":"Ok, we have been here a few times for breakfast, but never for dinner.  We liked breakfast, so we redeemed a couple of casino rewards for dinner.    I have to say that I am not sure which was worse, the quality of the food or the taste.  Over salted, undercooked, tasteless, and unappealing are the first things that come to mind.    There was food laying over the sides of plates and bowls in the serving stations, and some food was clearly left out too long and dried out.  I tried to draw attention to the soup area where someone had spilled split pea soup all over, and the server just shrugged and walked away.   I tried to overlook it, but it was quite possibly the most unappetizing meal I ever attended.  Sure made it easy to stick to a diet!    Our server was a joy as well, he came over once when we came to the table and then brought our iced tea. He did come and bring my husband some more tea, and that was last we ever saw of him.    For the record, it was not busy at all. There was no line to get in.  I guess that should have been the first clue.    In the event I ever receive another offer from them I can honestly say the gastrointestinal issues from this visit will keep us from taking advantage of it."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. The place is pretty big, very clean and well kept place. We waited in like for about 15 minutes but it didn't seem to be that long. There are a variety of different foods to choose from so everyone should be able to find something. I am vegan, and when my family decided to eat here I imagined I would be SOL on options besides fruit or salad but I was surprised to see more vegan options than I thought.  I do have a few complaints, though.   A lot of food lacked flavor. Not to the point where I couldn't eat it, but it was just a bit bland.  We got to the buffet right after breakfast so it was just the beginning of lunch and the staff seemed to have forgotten about changing the labels of the food because most of them were wrong/not there so sometimes I wasn't really sure what it was that I was looking at.   The salad bar is a nice touch but there are only a couple options for salad toppings like black olives, tomatoes, chickpeas...but it was missing a lot of things like cucumbers, carrots, broccoli, stuff like that. A bit lackluster. I still enjoyed my salad though.  I think it would be cool if this place included some nutritional info on/near the food labels so people don't have to be constantly asking about what it is that they're getting. For example maybe a \"V\" next to the things that are vegan and/or vegetarian. Or warnings about nut allergies or things that are gluten free.  There's a big variety of desserts available but I wasn't surprised that just about nothing was dairy free. A lot of people are vegan/lactose intolerant so it would be cool to see more dairy free options!  Overall I think this would be a nice place to go with your family or whoever, but I think I'll stick to yard house when I go to Red Rock Casino. I probably won't be back, unless someone else is paying (lol). Although sometime in the future I may just give it one more shot to be fair, but I won't be planning on that for awhile."}
{"text":"Best buffet ever ! We paid $59 for 5 people's launch including drink  It was great selection and quality  Don't be fooled with high priced buffet around Las Vegas blvd and strip area  This is the deal"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem for locals. The quality of food and the variety is wonderful. In terms of all you can eat buffet deals I would give this place 5 stars. For 10 bucks during lunch time you can't get any better than this. Palace station is cheaper but compared to this place it feels like a fast food place."}
{"text":"Not too bad, I haven't been to a buffet in years and decided to go to dinner there with a few friends. I guess you need a players card to get the 10.99 deal but that's ok, paid the $18 and immediately went in to meet with the rest of my party. Our server was nice and polite, she had our drinks in a timely manner and was just a sweet older lady. I ended up trying everything from each section. The prime rib was ok, the mussels were alright. Tried crawfish for the first time, I loved the flavor but think it's a waste of time for something so small...but that's just my opinion. The tex-mex side I enjoyed the rice and some chips and cheese, everything else looked like it was slowly drying out. The noodles on the asian side could've been better, had no flavor but I did enjoy their fried rice and steamed veggies. Potato wedges were ok, a little soggy and the creamed spinach was pretty good! Loved the cherry cheesecake!"}
{"text":"We arrived here on a Sunday morning for brunch, before we left Vegas to go back home. The service was a bit lacking and the labels for food were just plain odd at times... like a sign above the green jello that said applesauce. The roast beef was there from the day before and so overcooked they could have made shoes with it. They replaced the soft serve vanilla with pumpkin... don't mess with artificial vanilla soft serve, it's a classic! The breakfast selection was good but oddly simple scrambled eggs were missing (you had to line up at the omelette station to get scrambled eggs."}
{"text":"Waiter very busy but always able to get what needed. Very excellent service. Crab legs and shrimp saluted in butter, herbs. Excellent."}
{"text":"A ver, no llevaria a una cita a  omer a este buffet, pero si he de reconocer que cuando  voy lo hago a proposito .... De mi mismo no de Henry,, como en algunos otros bufegs baratos hay muchos comensales locales, a veces por usar los generosos cupones y otras veces porque las ofertas son tentadoras teniendo en cuenta la calidas de los productos. En este concreto las carnes las trabajan muy bien, lo demas es como en todos lados. asi que claro que si, ve y cuentanos tu experiencia personal, la agradeceremos mucho.."}
{"text":"Have been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner. All three have a large selection to choose from, and almost everything is high quality for this price buffet and everything is always fresh. If salads are your thing you will love the salad bar here. Selection at dinner buffet is very good however it would be great to get a nice thick cut of beef instead of something that looks like it came out of the slicer at the deli. Even when you ask for a thick slice it comes paper thin. They try very hard to be exotic at the lunch buffet but it would be nice to be able to get a fresh grilled hamburger for people like me."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast (not brunch) because of the very cheap price and a buy one get one coupon.....ignoring some of the bad reviews. I should have listened and turned around. There was an omelet station but the line was always long so my husband & I didn't want to wait for it. Looked good but who knows. There were a lot of other options but just strange. Salad bar, quesadillas & chips served with waffles, watermelon & honeydew served with tomatoes & pickles.....strange. Everything we tried was barely warm and not the best. My coffee wasn't even warm. The waitress did bring another cup that was but I don't think that should have ever been an issue. The hash browns were gray...my brave husband tried them but he said they were cold and blah. The best thing I ate was a piece of bacon & a semi warm tamale (another less breakfast more lunch choice). Needless to say we won't be back even if it was free. I would rather pay more & have a decent,hot breakfast that I can enjoy."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet for $12 bucks. The food was great and of course I ate way too much!!"}
{"text":"I was violently throwing up within an hour of eating!! All night long, I have never thrown up that hard! My body was sore for 2 days afterwards! I called the buffet to report it, they said I had to call the security office, so I did. Made a report and they called me back with questions and that's it!!! $22 and I was sick all night! So no I won't go back!!! Horrible!!! Needless to say, they don't care!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted to have a buffet for dinner, so thought we would try here. Very nice dining room atmosphere and decor.   Food: Turkey was quite good, tender and juicy. Roast beef a bit dry. I wish they would have had little cups for your condiments though, if you use aujus, everything else on your plate ends up tasting like it as well. Carb dishes were fair, scalloped potatoes, mac and cheese, etc. They do have a chef made pasta bar available as well. Salad bar had a decent selection. Biggest complaint was that all the veggies were cooked beyond well done. Dessert bar was average. Ice cream machine could not keep up with demand, it was too soft for cones.  Also, there are signs stating that children have to be attended at all food stations. They were not. Hubby waited 10 minutes to get some \"ice cream\", due to there being two little girls taking there time dressing their ice cream. Making a huge mess by the way.  Service was fair, ended up having to hail down the waitress for a drink refill.  For the price, I guess it was fair."}
{"text":"One thing I love is variety. One thing you'll always find at the Red Rock Buffet is variety.  The Grand Cafe, Movie Theater and Buffet are the only things I like about the Red Rock Hotel (I hate that place, but that's a different story).  Out of all the buffets I've been to, this one and the Rio are the only two which have good sushi. Sushi is always lackluster in buffet settings, but at least here it's fresh most of the time and is at least somewhat comparable to the quality of an actual sushi bar.  The service can be a little snooty at times (the Red Rock is essentially a giant Strip wannabe), but they do their job by always providing your requests.  Dessert section=love. Cannoli, Cheesecake, Gelato and Tiramisu, hooray for diabetes.  The Red Rock is essentially in the middle of nowhere so I rarely ever come here, but I never regret the trek out here whenever I do."}
{"text":"Not worth your money here. Food Selection is very limited. Taste is so-so. I wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"Don't come on Sunday morning.  She said today is Sunday brunch. When I'm come inside.  Omg!!  This is buffet??   Very small kitchen and don't have seafood at all on Sunday brunch. Food is horrible. Service very good"}
{"text":"Every casino has a buffet. However, Sunset Station is a few notches above the rest. First off is the atmosphere. I love the Tuscan inspired dining hall, topped off with soothing cool blue lighting. When you walk in, you pay at the cashier (make sure you use your rewards card!) and a server then comes to you and asks how many are in your party. Next you are seated and asked what you would like to drink. They keep things neat, orderly and clean here. Love the food stations, they are all well laid out with regards to foot traffic. Utensils are logically placed and the servers are attentive. The food is spectacular, it was all I could do not to gorge. In fact I had to run up to my room afterwards and take a few Tums, I ate so much. Just go already!"}
{"text":"I took my out-of-town relatives here yesterday, before their return flight. NOT as I expected. It was the Sunday Champagne Brunch. We were not offered champagne. We're all adults. For a Sunday Brunch, there was NOTHING great to differentiate it from an everyday brunch, sans champagne. The entrees were VERY limited. carving Station had sausage, turkey and ham. The only chicken offered was a chicken piccata, which was terrible. No baked or fried chicken. Sam's Town Everyday Buffet has MUCH more variety! The veggie selection was virtually non-existent. Fruit?? Forget about it. Only 2. No pineapple, peaches, etc.  The only reason I didn't give 1 star is the waitress. Even though she didn't offer champagne, she was delightful.  Moral: If you're in that area, go to Sam's Town."}
{"text":"Great buffet at a great price.  We went for lunch and the selection was good and seemed to be of good quality.  The people were very nice too. Take a break from the strip and come here."}
{"text":"Vegas baby! Getting that fire buffet food! Not bad at all for the price! Food isn't amazing but for what you spend here it's fantastic quality! Good service good atmosphere overall a nice budget buffet with good variety."}
{"text":"Compared to similarly priced buffets, this buffet is very good.  We are local to this one and have eaten breakfast, lunch, and dinner here.  Like all buffets, if you come at the end of the meal times, the food will not be quite as \"fresh\"  As a general rule, Station Casinos buffets are above average.  Of course there are other things to do at this property."}
{"text":"There are better buffets in Vegas, but not many are better for the price and location (for us) than the Feast at Texas Station.  I only come here when I get two-for-one coupons in the mail, because you can't beat an all-you-can-eat dinner for $5 per person. My husband and I each always get a taco, although I was sad to see there were no flour tortillas tonight. (We both usually make a \"double decker,\" wrapping a hard taco inside a bean-smeared flour tortilla.) It's also hit-or-miss what foods will be on the buffet. I usually get a plate of mussels and crawdads, and while they had some (overcooked) mussels available tonight, there were no crawdads in sight.  That said, what do you want for $5? I had a tasty hot link, a so-so rib, and some fair-to-middlin' red beans and rice (along with my aforementioned taco). Finished off the meal with a small piece of carrot cake and an ice cream cone. As usual, they were good about refilling the drinks, although it took some time to get our dirty plates cleared away.  Say what you want, but I will keep coming here for a cheap meal as long as they keep sending me coupons. I just wish they'd bring back the crawdads and cut back on the cooking time for the mussels. And how about those flour tortillas?"}
{"text":"We started our visit at the players club kiosk to see if our players club card had any offers. The kiosk was so user unfriendly that it was impossible to use or get any information.  At the buffet the cashier scolded us for being in the wrong line.  After eating we looked at the entrance again and neither line is marked.  The hostesses never know where the empty tables are, they escort guests in then try to figure out where to put them. Inside the buffet there were two servers, a woman who did not speak English and a man who was almost too fat to maneuver between the tables.  The woman was supposed serve our table but she never brought the water we requested.  The floors inside the buffet were very dirty. We noticed the same thing in the casino area, especially in the corridor leading to the movie theater."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting a 5 star experience. This buffet is average at best. When I say average I mean that it's good but not great. They do offer unlimited momosas and/or champagne on Sundays. You can never go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"FRIDAY NIGHT BUFFET!!!! The crab legs are to die for...I want that recipe!!!"}
{"text":"We went during lunch and there wasn't much of a good selection but it was only 8.99. I have heard the breakfast one is really good but we missed it. I'm not really a buffet person but this one wasn't too bad. I had the turkey, the chorizo sausage(good), the mashed potatoes and some other type of sausage. It was all good enough I thought the mashed potatoes tasted homemade.  Our server was fantastic! He was always there with more sodas and to pick up our plates. Up font is a different story there is no organization and it needs to be run better."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and never thought to review it.  As far as Vegas buffets go, it's a good one.  The price is pretty reasonable when you look at the price places like Bellagio and M are charging.  But you get less of the high ticket items at dinner which is the one this review is based on.  Once they let you in, they have an Asian, American, BBQ, Mexican, Italian, dessert and salad items each at different spaces with nice big signs over each (except for the soup and salad bar which should be obvious...)  This place is always consistent too.  You can always count on the cocktail shrimp, a diminutive selection of sushi, Mexican items that have clearly been under the heat lamp too long, Italian food that has suffered the same fate, two selections of roasted meat that they will cut for you, fried chicken and shrimp, corn on the cob, some type of mashed potatoes, ice cream (low and full sugared).  I avoid all the starchy stuff, bread, pasta etc.  I also stay away from their dim sum.  Go here for the roasted meat, pot roast if you're lucky, fajita chicken, fried chicken (yum!), cocktail shrimp and if you're craving Italian, the meatballs.  I don't know why they don't always have spaghetti to go with them, but I won't complain.  More room to fit other good things!    The ambience is upscale for a buffet too.  Lots of tables.  Of course, buffet ettiquette being what it is, be on the lookout for that hundred foot gape on the faces of the crowd.  They'll swoop in in front of you or knock you to the floor altogether in their haste to pig out.  One couple lingered in front of the shrimp for several minutes, with the wife trying to convince her husband to \"just use your hands, just use your hands; they work!\"  Eww.    Fair warning:  The staff are pretty strict here about taking any food from the area and they're not particularly subtle.  Doesn't matter if it's one cookie or if you're stuffing shrimp in your pockets.  They let everyone know what you did!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't TERRIBLE but options were limited.  My son hit his ear VERY hard and was bleeding and started to swell!!!  Staff acted put off just by me asking for a bag of ice!  I wasn't needing a manager or complaining but after the way the guy handled it I was sooooooo upset!"}
{"text":"One of the Best Buffets in Vegas and at a reasonable price. Both Breakfast and lunch were great!! For lunch there is an excellent salad bar and great choices of food from all over the world including a couple of grills. So whether it's the Freshly carved meats, Parmesan encrusted fish, Philly, Burger or Pizza there are tasty bites here for all! Worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"The Feast Buffet at Green Valley and Red Rock are the best.  They offer a huge selection of different food items.  Don't pass up dessert though and try the spumoni ice cream.  You can also have milkshakes made to order.  You should definitely get the Station Casino Boarding Pass (even if you don't gamble) so that you can get discounts at the buffet.  If you do gamble and spend boat-loads of money, you can get upgraded to Platinum and Chairman status and don't have to wait in line for the buffet."}
{"text":"Even worse than Arizona Charlies buffet, nothing was even close to being hot enough to enjoy eating, the turkey was luke warm and dry as a bone, the mashed potatoes were watery and runny, the brussel sprouts were hard and cold and even the milk had a turned taste to it. As for the desert station it was horrible as well, everything was dry and hard and inedible except the Ice Cream, of course, but had to wait over 5 minutes to get someone to scoop us out a scoop, astonishingly enough the ice cream wasn't bad.  I have eaten at the Feast Buffet at Boulder numerous times and never had a complaint, this is the first and last time visiting Red Rock Feast Buffet.  If I could give it negative star rating I would, stay away from the Feast at Red Rock, it is not worth any money let alone $15 a head after tax."}
{"text":"I love their breakfast buffet. You cannot get a better deal for the price. Their selection is perfect (anything you'd get at a local IHOP or Denny's and for the same price, except you get to eat all you want). Staff is friendly and place is clean!"}
{"text":"I am going to go on the record and say that I love this place. This place is as good as it gets when it comes to local buffets. It's no Wynn buffet, but it caters to locals both in price and friendliness.  A few items really make this place great. I'll break it down by sections that I love:  Asian: Tilapia/Sea Bass in Teriyaki Sauce, Eggplant, and the Shrimp and Pork Wonton Soup are delicious. I recommend adding chili flakes to the wonton soup to really bring out the flavors.  International: Quesadillas and Churros. Now here's the key to navigating the international section -- it's all about the condiments! The salsas are surprisingly tasty (most places underseason their salsa -- that's right salsa needs salt! -- but this place has it down pat). As for the churros, next to them there is a stack of seasonings with cinnamon sugar at the top. GET THE CINNAMON SUGAR! Really makes the churros delighful.  Dessert: Two things make this place work -- the coffee gelato and the bread pudding. But here's the thing, I like to tweak these two items. When I am ready for dessert, I ask the server for half a cup of milk, then I get three scoops of gelato and some chocolate syrup and make myself a mocha shake. Kind of embarrassing, but completely delicious. For the bread pudding, like most, I add the vanilla sauce BUT here's the kicker, I top it with the cinnamon sugar next to the churros. Talk about diabetes in the making. A-mazing."}
{"text":"I frequent the Sunset Station Feast buffet. It is tempting to give a better rating because of this, but the truth is the value and service is just good enough to keep the family satisfied. If deciding between feast Sunset and Green Valley Ranch, this one has a slightly larger variety of items (by guess-stimation) and GVR is just a notch above in quality and overall experience. In this most recent visit, the broccoli and beef was good, meatballs were sensational, and our server put up with my odd drink requests. However, the chow mein was lacking flavor, roast beef was slightly undercooked, and whatever that chicken I had from the Asian section had lots of tiny chunks of bone in it, picking bones from my mouth is not something I enjoy.  Our server had no problem with us hanging around from 2 PM until 5pm, and I am sitting here typing this now and intend to go get dessert next. Stay away from the pecan pie if you do not want sugar free, I had to go through that a couple of times before I realized it was always dissappointing."}
{"text":"This is one of the better buffets we have been to in Vegas. It is a huge buffet with tons of food selection from American, Asian, Italian and Mexican cuisine. It also has one of the largest dessert sections I have seen at buffets with a large selection of pastries, pies and Gelatos to choose from.  With the Sunday brunch, you get complimentary champagne or Mimosas which is a perfect way to wash down all that food."}
{"text":"amazing buffet for cheap price.  Great selection of food last evening at Feast Buffet Red Rock Resort. Good taste for this price $16.99 with Boarding Pass Card. Look at my pictures from last evening."}
{"text":"Feast Buffet is okay  $10.99 for Dinner Buffet including soft drink is okay for this Food selection. Quality is good and fresh."}
{"text":"We came here as a group of four on a Saturday morning and had to wait about 15 minutes in line before we got to the cashier to pay. It was 10:45 am and they charged us the breakfast fee which was $7.49 with boarding pass (each boarding pass will give a discount for two people). The drinks are included. Heck yes. What a deal! Five more minutes of waiting till we were seated.  Because of our impeccable timing, we paid the cheaper price and were able to get the best of both worlds. Although not many breakfast items were left, we were still able to enjoy waffles, French toast, bacon and some other breakfast items in addition to the lunch menu. Perhaps coming a bit earlier would have resulted in an even larger selection of goodies from both the breakfast and lunch menus! Plan your visit accordingly!  The sushi line had to be the biggest disappointment as there were only a few assortment of rolls and some Japanese flavored vegetables. By far the best line was the BBQ line which included things like roasted turkey, baked potatoes, chili and cheese, and corn bread! Other lines included Asian, Italian, farmer's market and American.  If you have a sweet tooth, that tooth is sure to rot with all the goodies in the dessert section! Thank goodness my boyfriend is in dental school because I went wild! The banana cream pie had to be my favorite. The selection included ice cream mixed to your liking with your choice of cone and all kinds of pastries!   The food isn't top of the line but they have a great variety for such an amazing value. With all the money you save, you can hit the pai gow tables ($10 min bets at the casino during the early afternoon)! If you're a black jack type of person, they have $5 min bets during lunch time as well!  My best advice is to get there right when breakfast is about to end and lunch starts so you can get a good variety. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE unless you want to get punked by the staff.  Mark, the unprofessional lazy server, was upset that we did not want him to serve our table after making us wait 15 minutes into our meal for our drinks. We asked for a new server and got one.  No one bothered to tell Mark so we had to be the one to tell him.  That clearly pissed him off and he grouped up with a few servers to talk about it.  Yes, we SAW you and HEARD you, Mark.  Yes, that is also very unprofessional, but we didn't care that they wanted to have group therapy because none of them were our server.   Mark  must have cried to the assistant manager, Erica because she felt compelled to bother us 30 minutes into our meal to \"hit us up\" about it.  She said she heard there was an issue and if we start cussing, she'll call security and have us escorted out of there.  Excuse me???  Where is this \"cussing\" thing coming from and why are you harassing us?  We asked her if she heard us cussing and she said no, but she can review the security tapes.  Huh??? We asked why she was threatening us during our meal and where is the manager because she is not handling this situation professionally.  Upper management was not available per Erica.    Bottom line is, we didn't like the slow service so we asked for another server.  That was done and we were satisfied.  That should have been the end of it.  We thought it was, but not so much.  We were made out to be a bunch of cussing complainers according to Erica.  It was an especially nice touch to have 8 servers stand side by side against the wall on our way out to stare at us.  I felt like we were going to get jumped.  Eat here if you want to be treated like dirt."}
{"text":"Well.. Lets just say I'm glad this meal was free. I got two free dinner buffets for cashing out my income return tax here.   We came here on a Sunday around 4pm. The service was really good. And there was a large selection of food. Of bland food.  I tried many things including: roast beef, turkey, hush puppies, pepperoni pizza, corn bread, corn, mashed potatoes, baked potato, soba noodles, mac n cheese, nachos, beef, pineapple, and cookies n cream ice cream. My boyfriend also tried a bunch of different stuff. We both agreed, the food was extremely bland.  My pepperoni pizza was rock hard. I thought it would be fresh since they reopen for dinner at 4... The mac n cheese didn't taste like cheese at all. To cut it short, the only thing I did enjoy was the mashed potatoes, baked potato, and corn bread.   I would not return. I don't know if I would even return if it was free. It just didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"This is a beautiful casino with a beautiful buffet.  Too bad the service is horrible.  We were made to wait in line for over an hour (while we could see empty tables).  Making us miss the breakfast pricing by 3 minutes and not honoring the price.  The manager Rosa Zelaya has no training on customer service.  We were next in line as the lunch pricing started. We suffered because of the inability of the staff to process the line and seating quickly enough.  This is the place to go if you want to be herded and processed like cattle.  Extremely disappointed in the service of such a beautiful casino."}
{"text":"Clean with good service. For the price, the selection was dismal. I have seen more variety at the Golden Corral. The food tasted fine but when you pay over $30 per person you expect a bit more."}
{"text":"We use to eat here regularly, but its always only OK. It use to be our Sunday after church spot, but we haven't gone in a while. It is one of the better Station buffets compared to the Fiesta Rancho (absolutely terrible).   The line tends to vary depending on the time of day. It gets packed starting in the afternoon. The good part is that you can get discounts for taking surveys and having a players card. If you like fast food, you won't be disappointed. Its only slightly better than the drive thru."}
{"text":"Ask me what I had for dinner........everything! I traveled the world and seven seas at the same place! I had Chinese, Mexican, Italian, seafood, Vegan, sushi, seared, fried, baked and raw. I had so much food, I made up for what I paid three times! Human nature. Pay 10 eat 20 = happy human. Not only you get to beat the house, everything else  is very good including service and cleanliness. Every time I have company from out of town I always bring them here and they're always impressed. The only bad thing about coming to this buffet is all the calories You put in, I think I'll have to hit the treadmill now......nah,.. I'll just have a diet coke."}
{"text":"If you like low end food and enjoy losing weight by experiencing explosive diarrhea, then this is the place for you. The breakfast choices at this casino are limited to the buffet or the crazily overpriced, service challenged, and mediocre at best, Grand Cafe. So the challenge when staying at this hotel is knowing you have to eat breakfast at a sub-par restaurant......so you just eat only enough so that your're not hungry for a while!  Anyway, I and a friend each got sick within minutes of each other shortly after eating breakfast here. I am on guard at this buffet since the last time I ate here I found mold on several of the English Muffins at the toaster. When I reported it to the manager, she said she would report it. She was completely unfazed and unsurprised.  This time I ordered two eggs over easy. The \"cook\", Colin, was unable to handle more than one order at a time, and I got the eggs over hard.....very hard. It wasn't worth complaining since my expectations are already low. My friend got an omelet that was much smaller in size that we'd had in previous visits. Oh....and there were no plates at the omelet on each of the three days I was there.....that was another story! What a joke!  Shortly after eating, the stomach pains started and impacted one full day of a short three day trip. On days two and three, I went back to the buffet for breakfast but would only eat the fruit.  The quality of the food is low - VERY low. One day our server reported that they had \"run out of orange juice\" - at 8:30AM!!!!!!!! The workers are nice enough, but each time Green Valley's managers decide cost cutting in order, it seems that the buffet is the target of their cuts.  I've read other reviews of this place with similar stories of sickness, so I know it's not just me.  It does make you wonder whether or not they  lower the payback percentages on their slot machines too........none of the players would ever know!"}
{"text":"My parents live about 5 minutes away so I've been here several times over the years. My most recent visit will be the last. The cashier was short with our group and rude.  I will say that our server was very pleasant and on top of everything we needed. The Asian menu items were very good. The egg rolls were tasty and fried rice was flavorful. Desserts where pretty tasty. Everything else was mediocre. The final straw was when we noticed a pair of used men's boxer shorts in the buffet area on a pedestal. We tried getting the attention of a server( not our server)  who told us not to bother her because she couldn't leave her area. Finally alerted the manager who apologized and had them removed . Between the abrasiveness of a good amount of the staff, the meh food and the used boxers, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, Thursday afternoon. The people were nice, and the service was acceptable.   The food was 2nd rate; meat quality was not poor, but definitely substandard. Pastas were over-cooked and dried out. The fresh fruit wasn't spoiled, but over ripe and past it's prime.   This place has been going downhill for the past 18 months, and now it's to the point that I won't be back."}
{"text":"Knew they were trying to offer some VEGAN items so we went to check it out again.  It was a little confusing as the there is a sign that indicates vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, and dairy free.  But right under the sign we're some black bean quesadillas so I had to ask which items were supposed to be vegan.  Not the quesadillas, lol.  Kevin was the cook on duty and he very nicely explained each item and the types of oil used or even coconut milk in the whipped sweet potatoes!  They were great.  I had 5 or 6 small dishes in addition to a little hummus and pita.  Vegetable kabobs, curry vegetables, a rice dish, and fiesta corn were all vegan.    My main suggestions to improve are to label individual items as vegan so people like me don't have to pester Kevin.  There was also a quinoa salad on the salad bar that could use a sign if vegan- otherwise I have to ask somebody or just not eat.    Finally, there are a ton of vegan desserts in the world but none on the buffet.  Red Rock would be great to offer at least one - even if it was just a coconut ice cream or something."}
{"text":"Came here for a meal with my grandmother today (Friday, Feb 3rd, 2017). Had heard from a friend, this specific \"Feast Buffet\" at the Green Valley Ranch, had seafood buffet on friday's and they take their hot crabs and cook it to your liking (adding garlic, onions, chili, tomatoes.)  We had arrived around 0230PM and got to the cashier. Right before paying, the cashier had told me the buffet closes at 0345PM, if i wanted to stay for dinner, i pay for the difference between the lunch and dinner prices. I had talked to my grandmother and shes like eh since we were here, might as well eat, just $10 per person for lunch, with boarding pass (station casino's players card). I've never heard of a buffet have their customers pay additionally so i decided to test it, wondering if it was just a gimmick the cashier used  For lunch, there isnt much of a selection. Their buffet isnt big to begin with in comparison to other buffets around town. Dessert area, italian, american, mexican, and Mongolian/Chinese. Oh also a salad bar. Decided to kill some time, get a plate or two of the mongolian (i like baby corn, water chestnuts, and mushrooms... and oh garlic... so guess what mine consisted of... xD)  italian had 3 different pieces with calzones and breadsticks.. some pastas and raviolis that look dried out from being untouched, normal alfredo and tomato sauces and meatballs  american had ham and turkey at the carving station as well as the usual catfish, potatoes, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, mac n cheese, brussel sprouts, meatloaf, etc.   mexican had tamales and like a taco bar...  mongolian is the usual mongolian hot plate thing where you get your own ingredients and they cook for you with your choice of meat and sauce (oh they are very heavy handed on the sauce... let them know if you want it lighter!)  chinese had the usual uhh fried rice, chow mein, veggie egg roll, fried wonton skins, chinese bbq pork (not fatty), eggplant  For a buffet, kind of a low selection, considering im almost able to name em all in such a short review.... off the top of my head hours after being there...   Essentially ate at a slow pace while chatting. 0345p hit, no one came around aside from one person saying last call for lunch and thats it.... a few tables left around me and a huge party int he area next to us. By 0400pm, a decent amount of people were rolling in. The people around us that were here as long if not longer than us got up and got crab. So we did too. They have cold and hot crab, also the option to hand the hot crab to chef's next to the station to cook with additional flavor/seasoning. Seemed like a lot of people knew about this style and the line formed fairly quickly for it. I had asked for everything and spicy. Not bad. Pretty messy. As mentioned before, they used garlic, onions, tomatoes, chili sauce and cooked over a hot plate.   By the time i almost finished my plate, a new waiter had started working the area, checked out receipt on the table, and i guess called the manager or someone over. That person explained that they had someone come around saying last call.. I assumed it was last call to get food before they closed to prepare for dinner. Usually any other buffet, thats what it meant during their \"down time/last call/etc\". They explained either we can leave or pay the difference. Never had i ever experienced anything like this. I'm almost tempted to call it a racist thing as we were the only asian table in the area. They didnt have any other table leave except ours, and they've been here longer, as my grandmother had noticed. We just decided to get up and leave and didnt want to argue. we were kind of prepared to leave anyway but it just seemed really weird for this to happen."}
{"text":"It was a buffet.  I did really like the Won Ton soup and the beef was pretty good.  I sampled lots of other stuff and it was just meh.  My mom and I had never been to this one so thought we'd give it a try.  It was what it was.  The Sunset is closer and I think a little better so if we buffet it up again we'll just go back there."}
{"text":"The place is beautiful, it was recommended to us by a family member that mention to us it had great food with decent places. Everyone has their own perception of great places but for our first experience it was not worth the 65 bucks we paid for 2 adults and a 6 year old even with a players card. Don't know if we will make it back."}
{"text":"Definitely get your money's worth here. 40 bucks for a family of four! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I was really hopeful to have found a good cheaper buffet in Vegas. We at here for dinner and half the food was very obviously sitting out for ages. The oriental side was very very disappointing. The Italian was pretty good. Dessert left a lot to be desired. And the apple juice is nasty. Ultimately there was enough edible food that I left full and somewhat satisfied but I would not recommend this buffet at all."}
{"text":"At first I was hesitant visiting at this buffet but I was told the food is decent and it's affordable. So I gave it a try. I came here on a Sunday after a great workout. There was already a long wait line and I'm hungry. It took one hour to finally be seated. The first thing I went for was something hearty. Thank goodness they brought out a fresh hot tray of Chicken Parmesan. They have other hot food varieties but I'm a picky eater. There's also a good selection of salad. When I returned to my table I was ready to eat, but there's no utensils, no napkins, not even a drink. I had to wait for a server to come by to get utensils. I can understand how busy it can get around lunch. I know that on Sunday brunch you can get bottomless mimosa but I chose grapefruit juice, and the server I had was quite friendly and attentive in giving me refills. As for dessert, there is only one thing I like that taste good -- Peanut Butter Cookies."}
{"text":"Horrible lunch buffet.  I don't know if we went on a bad day or what but the food tasted old and dry.  The price was excellent so we thought we would try it....but I would never go again.  Not even worth the cheap price."}
{"text":"Price was good, food was good.  There is a large variety for lunch and everything was fresh and tasted good.  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars was the server was slow, we had dishes stacking up and right before we left she asked if we wanted another drink.  Other than that...worth going to."}
{"text":"We came here for the dinner and for the lower priced buffets, it was excellent!  Their bbq beef was excellent as well as many other things.  Well worth going to."}
{"text":"Best buffet in town? Ya right! We came on a Friday morning at about 10am We waited about 50 minutes in line to get in. We still got the breakfast price of $6.99pp. We immediately got in the omlette line because we knee it closed at 11. After waiting about 20 minutes the breakfast turned to lunch and the omlette line became the carving station and burger line. I decided to get a burger instead and the guy decided to give everyone in line behind me a burger first and then i had to wait another 10 minutes for him to make more. It was horrible! Had no seasoning or flavor. I continued walking around the buffet to discover they only had salad lettuce to put on the burgers. I make a Ceasar sakad, grabbed some meatballs and a pasta all tasted horrible. The selection was not very great at all. I probably would not come back"}
{"text":"Excellent variety of food.  Clean.  Only $9.99 with a players club card.  Can't beat that value when you consider Chipolte costs $30 for only two salads and chips/guac!  Definitely recommend.  Only complaint are the ridiculous long lines that start forming around 11am and breathing your way through disgusting cigarette smoke to get to the buffet."}
{"text":"Delightful variety of food, veggies, meats, sushi and deserts.  With the players club card it's only $9.99.  Great value stop if you're up this way."}
{"text":"Been here many times as the price value quality is a solid three and half stars. Keep your expectations in check as this is not going to be a high end gourmet buffet and you will be happy.  The Friday night crab leg buffet is incredibly funny to watch gluttons of people pile on double fisted mountains of crab legs on plates of made to order sauteed crab legs in a delicious burnt garlic chili paste green onion mixture. It's truly funny to watch the spectacle of people fighting in line for crab legs, that unfortunately come short of quality in that the legs rarely get a clean break from the meat so it is extremely cumbersome to pick the meat out.   I come here during breakfast or lunch simply because it is priced well for locals."}
{"text":"Eaten here countless times. Food is good value. Make sure you get a player's card as it reduced the price. Also if you play you can use your points. Good local buffet."}
{"text":"Took a party of 8 here for Christmas Eve. The charge was $18 and they charged an additional 18% gratuity! the table wasn't set up for us, service was nonexistent & food was terrible. It was so bad my husband walked out & went to Fat Burger. What a disappointment. I thought I was going to really treat my kids to a special meal. Instead the memory left us empty handed."}
{"text":"We paid 8.99$ for lunch. We also had a two for one coupon we received in the mail. The buffets presentation was well, Service was also nice. I liked the fact that the buffet wasn't overly crowded as some would be such as the Texas station buffet. It seems like the basic food wasn't all that great but some of the others were very good so they seem to balance each other out. We enjoyed the pork ribs and the chow mein. The pies at the dessert bar were ok some were very good and some weren't so great. They had a large salad bar as well as a large fruit bar after everything we experience today I will be going back the price is Right."}
{"text":"$20 lunch for two with drinks and dessert?   While the food is standard fare comparable to a good ole Chinese buffet, the dessert is quite good. A lot of \"NSA\" options. As if you'd be worrying about sugar when you eat at a buffet. They have different ice cream flavors, gelato, AND soft serve with a topping bar of course! You can even make an ice cream cookie sandwich if you so desire. The pastry section offers different kinds of pie and again, with sugar-free options.  $3 specialty drinks if you want some adult bevies.  Excellent service, it's like they're secretly watching you eat and clear your plate as soon as you eat your last bite and refill your drinks right away.   Sign up for a boarding pass card for $3 off :)"}
{"text":"It's a very good buffet with a variety of food.I need to go back on Friday for their seafood.nice fresh food"}
{"text":"Dinner and breakfast at this buffet is very good. Service is decent. And the dessert station is delicious. Only a lackluster lunch  prevents this place from getting a five star"}
{"text":"I've been coming for 6 years and this used to be a great reliable place to get a decent buffet. For the price range, it was the best. Now the selections are bland, unappetizing and so strangely random. The \"international\" section tonight consisted of weird veggie sliders, sweet-potato quesadillas and Green Giant-esque peas and carrots?? Really??   The presentation was really bad as well. Lots of signs that didn't match the food, and about half the food didn't have names at all. Serving pans with burnt residue. Unappealing.  Service was pleasant and friendly. Desserts/Gelato were the highlight. I'm glad they haven't ruined those yet.  2/5 because of how far the quality has diminished in the past year. It used to be 4.5-5 stars and to drop to barely a 3 is disappointment."}
{"text":"We decided to give it another try last night since my aunt had some 2-for-1 coupons. It was their Friday night seafood buffet.   I skipped the oysters this time. The clam chowder barely had any clams. The shrimp cocktail were not fresh once again. The ceviche was ok. The beef tenderloin was really tough. The ginger crab in the asian section was ok.   We were here mainly for the ginger crab legs. I want to apologize to those who had to wait behind me as I was stacking ginger crab legs on my plate. I was getting about 12 deep on each plate, and I got at least 4 plates of ginger crab.  Our waitress was nice. Last time there was a waitress going around just to empty the crab shells off the tables, not last night though. Our table was always full of plates of empty crab legs."}
{"text":"At the Green Valley Ranch Resort -  Decent food for the price $5 for breakfast, $12.99 for dinner- decent selection, clean, etc.  Apply for the gaming card (Station Casinos) for these prices.  (I've been going to too many buffets lately - time to do some sit ups)"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love the gluttonous affair of partaking in a buffet! The choices! The idea of bottomless trough of chow! The price paid of admission to a smorgasbord of delectable delights! With that being said, I love me some buffet. The query at hand though is the \"FEAST BUFFET\" at Red Rock Hotel & Casino. Now being a Vegas Local, I've had my experience of buffets.  From  Excalibur buffet, Planet Hollywood Spice Market buffet, RIO world buffet,  Wicked Spoon Buffet at Cosmo, Studio B at M resort, Buffet at Wynn, so on....Where does Feast buffet stack up against the competition? To make is simple I fall back on the overly used yet overly appropriate quote \"you get what you pay for\".  Though it does not compare to the upper echelon of buffets (i.e. M resort, Bellagio, Wynn) it fares more closely to mid-tier choices such as Rio world buffet and MGM buffet.  That being said the thing that sets it apart from those buffets is the price! 13.99 for dinner? Yes please. The choices are moderate for a Vegas buffet, offering you 2 different cut to order steaks and usually a honey baked ham as a main entrée, worldly offerings such as sushi, Mexican, Italian, and Chinese medley of fare.  The taste was nothing extreme with some choices being bland and desperately asking for some hotsauce, gravy, or a little salt and pepper.  There are lots of other pre-cut entrees though, such as a multitude of chickens (the most versatile of meats!) and beef and pork products. The salad bar is decent with your typical choices of fresh veggies but one thing I like for the gluttonous AND slothful is that they have premade Caesar salad.  They also have about 3 typical soups (chili, chicken noodle, minestrone) in the salad bar and a few ethnic choices in their respective cultural sector of the buffet. The desserts were standard fare, with ice cream, cookies, cakes but best of all pie! There are a bunch of pies in the display case and you simply ask them to slice you a piece! I tried the lemon meringue, the banana cream, and the cheesecake (GLUTTON! GAH!).. They were all decent with the cheesecake being my favorite. Ok, it's hard to review a buffet as there are too many choices so I will tell you overall, FOR THE PRICE, it's not bad! If it were more than $20 I'd pass, but as long as they run their special (you need a players card which is free so get one first) then I might go if I'm lazy to cook and can't decide what to eat and too lazy to drive to Rio (better choice same price IF you are a local - Mon-Fri half off for locals at rio World buffet). Ok fellow connoisseurs of the culinary empire of AYCE..buffet away!  (geez how many times did I said buffet? 10 e-props if you can't count them!)"}
{"text":"We frequent this buffet when we are on the west side of the valley. Good solid buffet, price is very reasonable, if you use your player's card you are given a discount.  Staff is friendly, at times they do seem a bit overwhelmed. However they do seem to bounce back quickly.  The carving stations carry grilled veggies which personally I find a huge plus! Salad station is nicely appointed. Hubs feels the Asian offerings to be acceptable.  Dessert station is okay for off strip.  This place is worth the price."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong here for breakfast. Omlettes made to order and the service is great. They guy Jose that makes the omlettes is great always on point when making mines. Can't go wrong for the value on this. 4.99 with players cards.....All good...Just so you know im sure it was mentioned here on some review...Its no longer a STATIONS CASINO, and no longer called FEAST BUFFET its now MEDLEY BUFFET."}
{"text":"Second visit in two months (actually ate here twice in two nights in April). Exceptionally fresh food, brought out in smaller caserole dishes. Asian food is always excellent (try the sesame, teriyaki or orange chicken). Meats, veggies, different international options, are all very good. Wifi is super fast closer to the dessert area. Get there before 5pm to avoid the line ups which can exceed 1hour. $10 price is tremendous value."}
{"text":"I got to eat here for free. It was actually really pleasant. Most of the stuff was good. The best thing was definitely the duck."}
{"text":"Another Station Casino. Another good place to belly up to the buffet!!  We were very pleased with the variety and the superb quality for a buffet. It certainly is not anywhere near gourmet, but for a family dining experience, this is tough to beat for about $14 for dinner. And the deserts must be shared among the Station Casinos. They have the same splendid Spumoni ice cream as the Red Rock Casino, and the food was virtually identical. And in this particular case, that is a very good thing!  We were very pleased with the entire experience at this Casino, and this simply added to the appeal. We will return on our next vacation in a few months!"}
{"text":"Better than I hoped! After a morning hiking at Red Rock, I was tired and hungry and wanted something fast. When we saw the line, we almost went elsewhere. I'm glad we didn't. The line moved fast.  There were several different ethnic varieties as is common at Casino buffets. I tried several and found them to be better than average on all accounts. The food was fresh and frequently updated.   However, the real kicker was at the dessert counter. The Spinoni ice cream was outstanding. And their cheesecake was good too. But don't miss the ice cream. What a treat!"}
{"text":"Typical Las Vegas Casino buffet except maybe a better price due to location. If you just want some food and are not too concerned about quality, this should do. I really expected a bit more."}
{"text":"The food here is gross - not fresh, very dry, overcooked and doesn't taste well at all. I give 2 stars just because of the fast service."}
{"text":"It's bland and gets the job done but would not recommend .. You're in Vegas eat anywhere else! Heck, even yard in red rock is a lot better (came for lunch 2:30pm on a Thursday)"}
{"text":"Decent food at decent price. Staff is friendly and would recommend this place. If you have the Players Card you get a discount on the price. Would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Suspiciously quick line to pay, suspiciously slow line to get in... about 10 minutes in line in order to pay for brunch and then 45 afterwards. I'm standing here, hungry, looking at dozens of empty tables large enough for our 4 person table."}
{"text":"Went here this evening for dinner with friends and found that options at the buffet were very hit or miss. Considering the reputation, I expected better. Pricing is good though, and there are 2 for 1 deals out there- three of us dined for $30 and change.  There was a good wait for a Sunday night at 5:30PM but the line went relatively quick. Was disappointed to see that the sushi selection was very small and consisted of cucumber and California rolls-- and when the meager amount was depleted, we were informed they were out for the day. At 6:15PM. Seriously?  Didn't have as many options as RedRock, which others have compared this buffet to. The Chinese/stir fry options were good- HUGE shrimp, for one. Lots of Mexican options but they were rather poorly done. Carving station had roastbeef but it was tough and difficult to cut with the provided butter knife. Dessert options were very odd- froyo and gelato available and several fresh-looking cakes/pies, but the cookies were clearly store-bought and did not look appealing at all. Fresh-baked cookies are my kryptonite, and I was super bummed to see this.   The majority of what I ate was peel and eat shrimp- it's at the Farmers Market salad bar area, FYI. Also, if you go to the tomato-mozzarella salad and just pick out all the mozzarella balls, there is a special place in hell reserved just for you. Don't do it!"}
{"text":"Food is great, place is clean, and the service is great!  We particularly appreciate the warm service of the Ms. Mary Ann Villanueva who took care of us and even gave our 3 kids easter egg chocolate.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The breakfast buffet has a good variety of plates that great potential and you can not beat the price and service!  My waitress Ms. Irma was phenomenal and made the visit extremely pleasant.  But back to the food, the potential of the food to be great is there, but the caliber of the food is not the problem here! It's the caliber of the chefs!!! Every entrée was over cooked and lacked seasoning. My eggs  were rubbery, my French toast rubbery and dry as well, and sausage was the same over cooked to the point were it felt like I was eating a slim Jim!   With better preparation and presentation, this place would draw more traffic! Station Casinos, please retrain your kitchen staff, because the lackluster food is causing your servers who are phenomenal to receive mediocre tips and lowering their moral!"}
{"text":"Good value, especially if you have the Player's Card. The selection is good - from Chinese stir fry to Roast Beef and Ham, to Mexican, to Italian and good ol' American classics. Whenever we need to satisfy a group with diverse tastes this buffet is a good go to option."}
{"text":"This became one of my favorite spots after moving out to Henderson. I really like coming here. Good assortment of food. Great pricing especially if you arrive for breakfast before 11:00am. Staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, stayed for dinner. With the players card (good at all the station casinos) you get a discount. We got her at 2:30 so they charged the lunch rate, and dinner comes out at 3:30.  This buffet is better than the other feast's IMO.  I am full."}
{"text":"Stop in for breakfast during the week because we saw it on Buzzfeed as a cheap option. It is about 30 minutes from the strip so unless you are heading to Red Rock Casino it is a bit out. We already had our boarder pass from a previous visit to one of there other casino so breakfast was cheap. The food is your basic breakfast food but for the price it cant be beat. The food tasted fresh and not like its been left out nor all greasy.  Overall I would go again if I was close by."}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet was very good. Have never been to a Las Vegas buffet so we decided to try dinner here too. Always saw on tv shows about the great food at the buffets here. Ribeyes, crab legs, fresh fish. Didn't see any of that here. Food was bland. I will certain commend them on options. They have variety covered."}
{"text":"Most of the food was dry. The service was bad. I never got a water refill until the very end."}
{"text":"Went to Feast Buffet 2x during my stay at Vegas. Suffice it to say, that I am done with buffets... for this month.  I went for dinner and breakfast.  Selections are plentiful no doubt. It's not the greatest quality of food but for the price, it is more than decent. I actually preferred breakfast over dinner.  At breakfast time, you can build your omelet. It tasted pretty good and was very cheesy. There's even cereal!   You even get unlimited drinks! Our server was really nice and got us every drink my group wanted.  If you're looking for an affordable Vegas buffet, Feast is the one to go!"}
{"text":"We have dinned here many times in the past but have not been here in over a year. We decided to have dinner here because we had a bogo offer. We were so disappointed in the food, to start we went to the italian station to have food cooked to order the lady chef had a bad attitude was slapping and slopping stuff everywhere my husband ordered the fish with white wine and a little lemon and asked for his penne pasta on the side. He didnt get the pasta on the side...She finished by slamming the food on his plate and said hope you enjoy. I ordered the chicken with alfredo and penne noodles, the chicken was over cooked and the garlic she added took over the flavor of the food. My husbands food had so much lemon thats all you could taste. We went to the meat carving section my roast beef was tough and lacked flavor, my husband asked for a piece of the roped italian sausage and they gave him a portion size for a toddler. My husband is 6\"1 and 250 pounds. Other than that there was nit much else that looked good to us the desert was a let down the cakes were a little stale out the outside like they had sat out all day and we use to love the ice cream but i think they changed whi they ordrt from because it tasted artificial and it never did before.   Now on the service we enjoyed our server our drinks were never empty, and he was always around when we needed something. He even said thank you more than once when my husband tipped him."}
{"text":"While staying at the Boulder Station last week we ate lunch one day and dinner the next at the Feast Buffet.  The food was pretty good, not great, and there was a lot of variety.  The restaurant was clean and organized.  I noticed the choices were almost identical both days which would have kept us from returning a 3rd time.  The price was very reasonable and service was good.  Not bad, but I've certainly eaten in better buffets.  Would go again the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite buffets when I'm in town. I love the made to order, right in front of you omelets. I've never been disappointed  especially when Kendra is our server. She's such a friendly face and always has a smile."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Horrible.  Horrible.  Tons of open tables.  Line is long and not moving.  Can no longer recommend."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, it is pretty standard buffet stuff.  But, if we're looking at what you're getting for the price, its not too bad.  If you're a Station member then the breakfast is only around $5, so that's usually what I go for"}
{"text":"Very reasonable price for what you get. , I'm going back this weekend  for brunch"}
{"text":"Being a new Las Vegas resident... I'm not yet a buffet expert... but this buffet was good! They had a huge selection of foods to choose from. Everything from American, Asian, Mediterranean, Italian..etc. The one thing missing was crab legs, but I read that they feature that on the weekends.  We stopped in the dine because of a comp I had receieved, 2 for 1 from MyVegas (check that game out on Facebook!). I was not disappointed! I also had a comp for a strip buffet and went to that buffet later that week...This buffet was way better. So if you get the chance to stop by here, the buffet is worth checking out...just bring you appetite though because we had a hard time walking out since we ate so much haha!"}
{"text":"Prime Rib is very good, tender, flavorful. If you want Medium Rare, you don't even have to wait for them to cook it further. Thursdays is all you can eat. The desserts are interesting. The Main Course selection is very good."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! We should've known when we asked the cashier if the food was good and she replied \"Well.....it's the best priced buffet in Vegas.\" Everything was horrible !"}
{"text":"Considering we went at 8 pm SUNDAY night this buffet was not super packed and only costed us $17 per person!!! By far the BEST budget buffet in town!!! Everything was above my expectations and if they had proper labeling I would have given this a 5 star review. Service was attentive and welcoming also, we all really enjoyed the atmosphere! Absolutely, will make the trip again when friends are in town!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful breakfast place for me who don't eat meat. All the eggs - any way I want it ! TexMex veggies and salsas too. Thank you Feast buffet! And 2 for one Military rate - Mon. Through Thurs. Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Dirty tables dirty carpet and mediocre food sums it up ... here's an idea why don't you try cleaning up and for example cut the Broccoli on your mongolian Station into bite-size pieces and cook the food so that it's not raw especially the veggies.....and as far as the Mongolian Grill employees go unless the tall white guy is on the grill avoid the Mongolian Grill at all costs the rest of the employees are despicable."}
{"text":"One of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas!  Delicious food even though they are not that fancy looking. Most of their food were very tasty, well-seasoned and cooked well.  Price was very affordable.   Service was great.  I always have to stop by and eat at this buffet whenever I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here for a late lunch. It's your standard typical buffet but better than most buffets in old downtown. Hubby and I got to eat free cause he had comps for 2 adults. I have been here for breakfast before and it was good. However, the lunch buffet was okay. Not too much to chose from. I enjoyed the dessert section. I enjoyed the cheese burger here. I forgot to take a photo of that but it was delicious! I had an iced tea to drink. The waitress didn't even bother to refill my drink. I enjoyed eating the vegetable noodles and the eggplant Parmesan. Very tasty and seasoned perfectly. The pork was tender. Tasted like Tocino. It was a little on the tough side and didn't enjoy chewing on it, so I spit it out on a napkin. Uggggh!  I also got to try the deep fried catfish. Yes, I said catfish. It was delicious! It was crunchy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside.  For dessert, I had the pumpkin pie which was great since I love the flavors in a pumpkin pie. Perfect spice and sweetness to it. I also sampled a canolli, a small blueberry muffin and a cookie (not pictured).  The desserts were good.  Service was okay. There were a few waitresses working the floor that were busy. The waitress that took our drink order forgot to refill my iced tea. Other than that, my experience was okay. This place is a must for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with this Buffet considering the price and location. I've really enjoyed spending more time out at Red Rock and this is a great place to have dinner before heading to the movies! Make sure to get a players club card, it will save you $5 on the buffet"}
{"text":"It's been here for years and the menu has changed a few times but $7.99 for dinner with your players card is what brings us here. The food is Ok and you can always find something to fill you up and that would sum it up. Also, I am not a dessertee (THAT'S A WORD NOW) which works out because the dessert station there is maybe the lamest I've seen in town."}
{"text":"ECK !!! Not Going Back. It Was The Land Of Bland. The Only Saving Grace Was That It Was 2 Fer February. No Need To Trash Food Items Individually. I Wonder What It Was Like When Stations Owned It."}
{"text":"Pretty decent buffet inside Green Valley Ranch. For $5 (with a preferred member card), how can you beat it! We lined up at around 10:15am and had to wait about 30 mins, so we were just in the nick of time to get some breakfast food before they cleared out for lunch.  The omelet I ordered was pretty huge, lots of ingredients, and I was able to order egg whites only. The rest of the breakfast food was solid. Then I tried their Chinese section (lunch), it was nice to actually see a Chinese chef cooking the food, and actually, most of it was pretty good! Had a decent dessert section too. I was looking forward to the ice cream, but I'm not sure if their fridge wasn't cool enough or what, but the texture of my ice cream was melted already. But again, for $5, totally worth it. Heck, even for $10 it's not that bad. Our waitress was pretty good too, and kept our drinks refilled."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet, and the prince it's  so cheep. Buena variedad en el desayuno y si llegan como a las 10:30 pueden disfrutar de el lunch por el mismo precioso. So delicious"}
{"text":"Visited the Feast Buffet at Palace Station recently for breakfast. There was no line to wait in this weekday morning - making me think this might not be well known. After we were seated - the server came right over and took our drink order. The buffet selection for breakfast was excellent ! They had an omelet station, dessert bar with donuts/danish, salad bar, and many of the usual items such as chicken fried steak, bacon, potatoes, sausage, pancakes, waffles, etc. Everything we had was very good ! We ended up going mutiple times during the week for breakfast. The price was very good and Wednesday is Senior Day where you get breakfast for half price if using casino credits to pay. This turned out to be a great breakfast option while visiting Las Vegas !"}
{"text":"Super expensive and not worth the time or money. Food is cold, and always the same selection. I had 2 kids and myself for 55.00. What?! Plus we had to wait over 30 minutes to get in. Not a fan of this place."}
{"text":"One of the main reasons that I rent a very fast car is so I can quickly skittle to Red Rock Feast Buffet!   The resort is first class and elegant in a cutting edge way and you can park right next to it. The buffet is different from other buffets in it's:  1: Half the price of a strip buffet - expect $ with a generous tip. 2: Food is scrumptious and hot regardless of when you visit. No leftovers or stale items. 3: SERVICE IS OUTSTANDING 4: Wide selection of food categories. Asian is very good. Dim sum and sushi! 5: The desert area is to die for. Great ice creams, pies and specialty items - worth three trips. Diet later!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Real quick, for the price you pay, this buffet is totally worth it!  Now on to the details:  Like many reviewers have said, make sure you sign up for the boarding pass before you eat.  It does not take too long to sign up BUT the lines for the buffet will be long so get there early!  I waited at the Green Valley Ranch location for up to an hour before finally piling food onto my plate.  In other words, if you want the breakfast buffet special, arrive AT LEAST 2 hours before the transition to lunch time, just to be safe.  So what about the buffet lunch recommendations?  Pizza, Mongolian Chow Mein, salmon, french fries, any fresh meat cuts, potato, and salad.  What you really don't need at the buffet:  Pasta, tacos, and fortune cookies (unless you really want your fortune before gambling)  Dessert wise  I say try any of it, at least a scoop of gelato if they have it.  Other than that, if you want to save money but still want pretty good, if not exceptional food for the price, definitely come by one of these buffets!"}
{"text":"Kinda Just okay -- like a hometown buffet.  The best part about this place (for lunch) was the fact that they have a pasta station that they make in front of you.  The pasta itself if okay... not the best, but not the worst either.  They have a variety of other options that are okay, but for the price of $7.99 (was it $7.49?) you get what you get."}
{"text":"It's a Feast buffet so don't expect much from the food! It was $12 for lunch with my players card. I got my money's worth but I cant mention any notable food that tasted good. It all tastes like frozen reheated food. It's all served luke warm or cold. I feel like if the food was actually warmed or hot it would make a difference. Small selection also. My three stars all go to service. I had to tip $10 because my server was so awesome!"}
{"text":"The food was good, as the Station Casino buffets usually are. I'm not expecting fineries, because this isn't the buffet at Caesars or Bellagio. But for its class, it's great. So try to remember perspective. This is not a 4-star review relative to the higher end buffets. It's simply a 4-star review for its class.  Sunday brunch was great. The Feast Buffets are always clean. Our server was also fantastic. The reason this is 4 stars is because our service was great, the price was right, and we even had a special buy one get one free pass.   They have their usual international selections. I always try to taste something from every section. And I have to say, there wasn't anything that I didn't really like. I was surprised to see lettuce wraps as an item in the Asian section. That was good. And I know fried chicken is just fried chicken, but theirs was good. They have a hamburger bar where they cook it for you fresh and you build your own burger. That was good too, the meat was good. The dessert station has a gelato bar. The salad bar includes salmon lox and bagels and a lot of other breads. Lots of fruit, too. Good!!"}
{"text":"The price and taste are really good...there are other buffets cheaper or averaging the same with horrible quality. The servers on the other hand are not great...they do not pay attention or come as often."}
{"text":"It's not fine dining, but it's great for the price. Get there early for breakfast at the lowest price around (with player's card) and get an omelette made to order. Yum! It's a buffet, not fine dining, but it sure tasted good for casino buffet food!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit here in quite a few years. Truthfully, the food quality is typical AYCE buffet.  However, the variety was amazing!  On one plate: collard greens, black-eyed peas, fried plantains, pizza, pot sticker, a spring roll, and Manhattan clam chowder. (Don't judge me! It's Vegas!) The dessert selection is excellent. Several reviewers have commented on the bread pudding, but I chose to regretfully pass in favor of cappuccino gelato.  Oh, Sweet Polly's Purple Petunias!  That stuff is incredible!  Besides that, I was most impressed by the people I met. Our server was an amazing gentleman named Will. If you're fortunate enough to have him care for you, count yourself well-blessed. He could not possibly have done a better job and cheerful and smiling to boot!  Add to this the price, we spent $60 for four people, including a nice tip (after all, it was Will!).  Many Vegas buffets are now in the $25-40. Great value!"}
{"text":"I came here for the breakfast buffet which is relatively cheap and the food was pretty good. I'm not a huge fan of buffets and food that sits under heat lamps, but it wasn't too bad. The thing is, once the breakfast buffet was over and they switched the buffet into lunch mode, everything went downhill.  The lunch items did not look appetizing at all and tasted worse than they looked. Their \"ok\" breakfast looked like a 5 star meal compared to the lunch.  I haven't come here for dinner in a long time so I feel like I shouldn't review on that.  Anyways, if you can wake up early enough for the breakfast buffet (it ends at 10:45 AM) then it is a steal. Just make sure you get out fast enough before the lunch menu comes in."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. My husband and I, along with our 6 month old, have been coming every Sunday since we moved here in July. The food is amazing. The service is even better. Between the cashiers, the seaters, the waiters and the managers, everyone is so friendly and so welcoming. Always making sure you are taken care of and have everything you need. Nicole, who works at the omelette station is so sweet and attentive. Kathy, who is a waitress makes you feel like you've known her for years. Hollis, a manager, always makes sure you're getting everything you deserve. And that's just to name a FEW. We tried the buffet at Fiesta and were so disappointed compared to our experiences here. 110% recommend this buffet. A million times!"}
{"text":"The Feast breakfast is currently $4.99 with a player card.  For that price, you get a nice spread of fresh fruit, a made to order omelette bar, all you can drink of non-alcoholic beverages (I had coffee, and it was good), carved ham, and all the other stuff you'd expect on the line (waffles, pancakes, bacon, sausage, toast, oat meal, cold cereal, the list goes on and on).  I can't go to a restaurant and get a small bowl of fruit and coffee for that price.  This is a hell of a deal!  It don't open until 8 a.m., and I'd prefer to start breakfast earlier than that.  If it opened earlier, it would get 5 stars!  Feast on, yelpers."}
{"text":"Las Vegas has so many Buffets and so many are not good. However, my boyfriend and his family decided to take me to Feast Buffet, which is a popular franchise for Buffets, that put other Buffets to shame. Make sure you get the rewards card for discounted buffet meals it was only $25 for my boyfriend, his mom, sister and I.  The lines can be long and we barely made breakfast while they transitioning into lunch. We got lucky and made the omelette station which was perfect for my new lifestyle of healthy eats at the time. However, with all buffet chains in Las Vegas you gotta wait to be seated and they will take your drink order.   Once we found our table we all jet off to the buffet war field. We get omelette and I am such a foodie so I look at everything they have to offer which is Asian dishes, Soul food, Mexican, Italian, American, and other foods that are mouth watering good. They even have a fruit, soup and salad bar too. Dessert bar filled with cakes, low fat and sugar free options...cookies and other yummy stuff like ice creammmmm!  Man I wish I had a huge appetite but I don't :/ the only negative that I have is that the pineapple was canned which was so gross! Other than that the food is fresh and delicious. I am never satisfied dining at Feast Buffets you definitely get your monies worth!"}
{"text":"The boy wanted this...not me.  I see the the name \"Feast\" and pretty much have figured out that id you have had one \"Feast\" buffet, it is going to be the same as any other \"Feast\" buffet you visit at any other Station casino.  With that said, I am not hating...FB will do when you want to graze on A-OK edibles with other humans.  The sushi was A-OK.  The salad bar was A-OK.  The desserts were A-OK."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Monday to have some breakfast with some buddies of mine.  Between coupons and using player's points the meal for three was dirt cheap!  Basically the same lay out as any other Station's Feast and the same quality.  I doubt I would go out of my way to partake in any style of human grazing here, that is unless...The company is good and if the cost to feed three people is the same price as a Big Mac."}
{"text":"Good buffet with lots of choices. Value and atmosphere is there in spades. Carving station, salad bar, oriental, Italian and deserts all good."}
{"text":"I'm generally not a fan of buffets but this one isn't so bad for the price. For the breakfast buffet, without a players card, it's $7.99 and $2 off with one. Made to order omelets are the highlight. There's a sweet bar for those with a sweet tooth and of course beer for breakfast, if that floats your boat. (I mean really... its Vegas!) My disappointment was in the fruit selections and otherwise healthier breakfast options. It really deserves 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food with exception of sushi.  Nothing fancy, but every person can find good food here including people on diets.  Staff is great all around.  Very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Toll booth attendants and great food!!! Great again! I went back tonight because I had a 2 for 1 coupon and I'm glad I did. The last time I went the food was horrible and had fallen off but they are back on their game and it was really good again. No crab legs but the prime rib was well seasoned, and med rare. The people who work at the stations are very strange and unfriendly but the food made up for the horrible, cold and unfriendly personalities. Scampi guy the worst, I talked to other clients while waiting and felt sorry for them having to put up with his abusive tone. The carver was cold and rude, and lied to us about not having rare prime rib, then as I sat there I saw if going out. The person at the ice cream went out of her way to be a jerk and insulted my friend. If not for the employees I would have given it 5 stars but the service at the stations made you feel as if an angry cop was pulling you over for a traffic ticket."}
{"text":"This buffet was \"ok.\"  It's affordable and there are plenty of options. I wouldn't necessarily drive all the way out to Red Rock to go there again though. Our \"server\" Stephanie was wonderful!"}
{"text":"It's usually and inexpensive place to take guest from out of town and family but the prices keep rising and the quality the same. Had family come in from Denmark and my wife just wanted to visit and not eat. Spoke with management and they did not give us an exception to their policy which cost me $11 for my wife to visit family or maybe I should think that it cost me $22 for lunch. I can see that they cannot monitor every who doesn't eat at a buffet and understand somewhat. But I didn't appreciate the way in which they handled the situation. I think the management needs some training in customer service rather than just restating their policy repeatedly. Not sure we will return any time soon even with a coupon. There are other places to enjoy."}
{"text":"It's an \"okay\" buffet at an \"okay\" property. Usually go for brunch on Sundays but their options are repeated on the different style tables.   Staff is, once again, \"okay\" since they are just there to react rather than to act. Takes a while to get a table sometimes but in the end there is always ice cream and dessert, which makes everything a tad bit better."}
{"text":"All you can eat and then some!  When I get the 2 for 1 coupons in the mail I feel like I need to use it.  For the price of 7.99 for two of us to eat breakfast, it's a great deal.  Obviously since its located in a casino/resort, the lines can get long.  But if Lady Luck is on your side, you walk right up and seated right away.    Service here is fairly good.  If you get coffee, they will bring you a carafe so you don't have to wait for them to refill.  The buffet is kept clean.  For breakfast they have all of the staples such as eggs, hash browns, eggs benedict, fresh fruit and breakfast meats.  For the most part they try to keep up with filling the empty foods.  They also offer an omelet station which is always busy but moves along fairly quickly.  Don't forget to save room for pastries off to the left side of the buffet. They offer a good variety of donuts, muffins and cookies along with some regular dessert cakes and pies.    If you have some picky eaters, sometimes a buffet will please those with plenty to choose from."}
{"text":"Not the best buffet in town, but with the price seems justifiable. Breakfast crew is much better than dinner. Evening servers are rude. Can't complain too much about the food too much though."}
{"text":"I went to feast for breakfast. I felt like this was pretty safe. I must say that everything was ok. The waitress was nice and attentive to my drink. The food was ok. It's hard to really mess up bacon, sausage, and waffles. The selection was underwhelming. There were the items to make eggs Benedict but the hollandaise sauce looked lumpy and thereby sketchy. Today is a travel day so I didn't dare brave that. The dessert section was very underwhelming and looked like it was made by a high school home economics class. The pie was cut haphazardly and the cakes all leaned. The donuts looked dry and the crisp appeared to be missing fruit. For $8.99 ($1 discount with the rewards card) it was ok but nothing to write home about. This was not worth the stop, even if you don't consider the truly wonderful strip buffets you can find. There are plenty of other dining options at GVR, and I suggest any of those."}
{"text":"Having eaten at this buffet for the last 3 years, I watched a steady and consistent decline in food quality. Shrimp are rubbery and not deveined, turkey and chicken are loaded with preservatives (taste and texture are the giveaway), and overcooked, and many other items are overcooked or lack freshness. Exceptions: the omelette station, fruit, smoked salmon, 3-bean salad, yams, baked beans, and surprisingly, their coffee. $36.78 for 2 includes $2 Stations discount."}
{"text":"Feast buffet is a great value with their gaming card. We were there on a Monday night and was only $14. The food choices were numerous and food quality was very good. Especially liked their salad bar area with many great healthy choices. Recommend the lobster ravioli freshly made and roasted Turkey was juicy and tender. Dessert options were many and gelato was wonderful. Servers were good and quick to clear your plate or to offer refills. Have eaten at this buffet many times. Worth the 20 minute drive from the strip. A great value with quality food offerrings. Get their free gaming card first to get a $4 discount off the regular price."}
{"text":"Didn't like this buffet. The tables and chairs were filthy and the food all seemed like frozen food that was microwaved. I even had a BOGO coupon and still didn't find the buffet here worth it. What happened the Stations buffets used to be better than this?! I remember a larger selection of desserts in the past compared to the mostly sugar free desserts they had during my visit. The prime rib even lacked flavor. Just not worth it for me."}
{"text":"I love it here. It always had great quality. And also. Most importantly. Great service. Always very polite and kind people. From the line cahiers to the cooks. I always come here since it opened. And please. If you can. Please stop by. They have asian and mexican and american and deserts as well."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood, figured GVR's buffet as an easy option.  It's a good buffet at a bargain price.  I would put Sunset above it, but people probably like this one better (and inexplicably, Red Rock even more).  It's an attractive space and layout.  I find the options somewhat limited, but the food quality good (given the price).  My favorite secret: you can get milk shakes, including malts, made.  Only buffet I know that does that."}
{"text":"Had a comp for a Friday night. The buffet is okay.  I enjoyed several different soups.  There's good pizza.  Though, some areas are lacking.  The Mexican section is sad.  The desserts are only average. Good for free.  Good if you're paying half price.  Not worth traveling out here and paying full price."}
{"text":"I've been coming to the GVR buffet for years. It's not the fanciest buffet in town, but you can't beat it for the price. The won ton soup is phenomenal, the sea bass is yummy (when it's a fresh plate), the rigatoni is usually nice too and their deserts are on par with most local buffets. It seems like the dishes don't really change much, they seem to cater to the \"Sun City\" crowd and go with the usual safe choices. Don't expect anything fancy or special, just the usual stuff. Service is so-so, minimal interactions with the waiters, but that's how I like it anyways."}
{"text":"We had lunch today.  Lots of choices.  Mostly everything was good.  Except the crowd chicken,  and  the ceasar salad was not the best."}
{"text":"This was very disappointing.  I had read the reviews and people were raving about it. Plus, it was cheap.   I shouldn't have listened.  Upon arrival, the buffet looked very nice. It was packed, the decor was nice, and it smelled fine.  But then I started eating.  The food was alright, definitely not the best but not the worst.  I tried the sopes, Turkey, mussels, various salads, eggs benedict, and so on.  Nothing memorable, really.   And who puts warm plates on the salad line?  The food was average. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"I love this buffet!  It is extremely inexpensive and has lots of options. Where else can you get all your drinks, salads, meats, pastas, and desserts you want for $10? And...and.. if you have a players card you get multiple discounts. Don't get me wrong, there are great buffets on the Vegas strip, but they will cost you up to 6x's as much.  Check out this Buffet! It will be worth the trip."}
{"text":"I would say that this buffet is just ok. There would not be a return visit for me considering the tough competition of buffets in Las Vegas. Restaurant ambience is on par with other buffets however I would say that the range of entree items is a little limited. I am speaking of a Saturday Brunch which I attended so I cannot speak for other dining times. Price was $17ish and apparently a Lil cheaper with the player card. Service was good. We had Mimosa's.Seafood eaters would be disappointed that there is only a shrimp dish. Not much Mediterranean items.... I kinda see the buffet as a brief summary of food styles. Salad options were boring. Not a lot of meat dishes compared to other places. Highlights include the multitude of Fruit Pies and Gelato flavors. Ok for the price but definitely not a return for me. I would likely go to Aria or M which have more impressive menus."}
{"text":"Blergh, no. I kept thinking well it was under $10 for lunch (with boarding pass card) so I couldn't expect much. I now realized I'd rather get one or two GOOD quality delicious items at places like Bread and Butter or Greens and Proteins then bunch of crap that this buffet was dishing out. This one is located inside of Green Valley Ranch and hence my expectation of higher quality food. WRONG.  Everything I tried tasted microwaved or stuff you could find at the grocery store. Some items were down right inedible. I had a piece of bbq chicken (I have found better quality at Vons), cheese ravioli that tastes so doughy and disgusting, mac and cheese which was decent but only because of the overpowering fake cheddar cheese out a jar that I used to love as a kid. The orange chicken was mushy and slathered in gross corn starchy syrup deeming it inedible, and the tofu was a mushy mess. The dessert section looked like grocery store bakery rejects. Never again."}
{"text":"Just an update, still a 3 star buffet but this experience was a little different than last. Wait times were only 5 min minutes and the servers actually greeted us with a smile and had us seated upon entering.  Standard food, I ate my 10 dollars worth."}
{"text":"Not a bad buffet and can't beat the price. If you have a players card you can get a discount. We only tried lunch and dinner which are pretty similar. Servers make sure to clear dirty plates quickly and keep your drinks full.   No one ever explained to use what the playing card they placed at the table was for and couldn't find anything on the website.  Can get crowded with a pretty long lines at time we lucky picked times with no lines ... they do close at 9pm and stop serving food at 9:30pm"}
{"text":"I have always really liked this place, and I see the reviews are really erratic-both sides of the spectrum. I have been here numerous times on several occassions, or none at all.  Went for breakfast today (get the free players card, it made breakfast $4.99) and really for the price, you can't beat it.  I pretty much go for the eggs benedict. The way to my heart has always been large variety in small portions, so hence the reason I love this place. I think I had 10 things on one plate. Eggs benny, hash browns, a sausage, bacon, biscuit with gravy, corned beef hash, blintz with strawberry sauce, mini blueberry pancake, mini potato cake, small scrambled egg pile and 2 mexican breakfast dishes I forget what they were named.  ok so 12. What really blew me away this time was : 1. our server was the best damn buffet server I've ever experienced-big bald white guy, awesome!!! I wish I had more tip money to give him! Very attentive and didn't forget anything. 2. The water is now served in big glass decanters with lids, like at Wicked Spoon. kudos! 3. The coffee was delicious, and it was real cream in a little pot They've really upped their game since last time I went there.  If you're gonna complain about a $5 breakfast, you're obviously an assh*le, and maybe the really low price makes me bias, but I just love this breakfast. Where else in Vegas can you get everything you want on one plate for such a low price? As far as buffet breakfasts go, this place is my fav hands down!  You can get $5 breakfast any day except Sunday, when they are doing Sunday brunch ($13.99 and you get mimosas!!)  See ya next time red rock!"}
{"text":"The Chinese vegetables were awesome, other than that, it was disgusting.  I also had a hard time getting a Bloody Mary for lunch, really, isn't this Vegas, shouldn't I be able to get a BM 24 hours a day?  I will NEVER be back..well, except maybe for breakfast, that is the time for a buffet I have ever liked anyway."}
{"text":"You know it is bad when you wish you spent your 8 bucks on Fast Food instead.  This place is a dump.  What can I say about the food.   It was just bad bad and more bad.  Nothing but the salad tasted good.   Everything tasted old and stale.  Man you know it is bad when you were happy to get a left over donut from the breakfast buffet.. hahahahaha...  Yeah it was that bad.  Chicken dry, Chinese food taste like crap.  I could go on and on...      I will close it out with this.   I might think twice about going here if it was FREE..  Not joking."}
{"text":"Every time I've been to this buffet there is a line.  That means other like it too, else why is there lines every time I'm here?   I like this place, its off the main drag of vegas, so its not super crowded and over priced.  The price is good and the food is very good.  Love the BBQ nights here. normal nights are just as good.  All the food I've had here has always been good.  If your in town I recommend stopping here."}
{"text":"I have a family of 4 and we're not picky eaters.  But for $15 a head I have a right to expect good food and good service. ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY CHARGE ME GRATUITY UP FRONT.  I'll start with our waiter. Can't remember his name. He wasn't rude, but he wasn't polite either. He took our drink orders but when we had questions about the food he looked like we were keeping him from whatever he'd rather be doing at the moment. He then disappeared forthe majority of our meal and refilled drinks only at the end.  The food selection was disappointing considering how big the buffet is. I walked up and down three times before settling on some sausage and prime rib for my salad. Nothing looked particularly appetizing.  The salad bar was a joke. Almost no toppings. The cucumbers and mushrooms were empty and when the patron next to me waved down the server he rolled his eyes, walked over to us and responded with, \"what.\" She asked him to refill the veggies and he proceeded to slam doors and toss food into the containers, making a mess the whole time.  That prime rib I mentioned? Dry and tough to cut. I didn't eat but two bites before scooting it to the side of my plate.  My kids opted for pizza and pasta. The pizza looked like it had been sitting out for hours. The pasta sauce tastes like it came straight from a jar, in the worst way.  Dessert selection was average. Cake, Brownies, cookies, pies, pudding, ice cream. Nothing crave worthy, but you don't go to the buffet for the pie I guess.  There are plenty of better places to eat."}
{"text":"First time at this buffet and it was good. This is located at the Green Valley Casino. Affordable pricing, but you have to get their \"boarding pass\" in order to get their prices. They were accommodating, but couldn't fit us all in one table, which was fine because we came as a group of 21, which we had a kids and adult table. The service was EXCELLENT, which we had a Filipino waiter and he was entertaining. The food was your normal buffet food. Depending on how many buffets you have eaten, this one is worth it for the money that you pay. Your sweet tooth will definitely be satisfied with their ice creams. Get there early because the line will get long. Overall, It was a great buffet experience for Vegas."}
{"text":"Decent buffet food and a bargain price - huge bargain, especially if you have coupons (and definitely have a player's card).  Options are what you'd expect from Sunset Stations including decent Mexican and good pizza. They seem to have more options than the top-rated GVR or Red Rock.  Two examples: at GVR, they had two types of pizzas out, cheese and pepperoni.  There was something like 5 at Sunset.  Another example, soup: at GVR, they had two.  At Sunset, they had 2 and chili in the salad bar, but then more at each station, for example posole at the Mexican or hot and sour at the Asian. They will do a to-order stir fry in the Asian area, but seldom do people utilize it. It's like a secret menu.  Remember two decades ago when people lined up for 20 minutes to get the Mongolian Barbecue at Rio?  No line here. Nor do people use the pasta station much. For the price, the food is very well done.  I don't hesitate to stop in.  4 stars, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Good price average breakfast,  thinking I may have been here towards the end of the breakfast service."}
{"text":"Anyone who appreciates a good tasting buffet is wise to skip this one. The wait in line is long, long, long. By the time we were seated many of the offerings were either empty or dried up. The dessert selection was extremely limited as I guess they ran out of options.   The biggest disappointment was the lack of quality of food. We were looking forward to a nice dinner but left hungry--almost impossible to do at a buffet."}
{"text":"I had heard this place was good from a pretty reliable source...a local secret of sorts...FAIL!  $25 each isn't bad.  $25 for a 4 year old is highway robbery!  The food is average quality and selection here.  Crab legs are not sliced open for you but they did have a slick station where you can have the cooks wok up the legs and make it spicy.  Gellato tasted like supermarket sherbet.     Not too impressed with this one.  sorry."}
{"text":"A coworker treated us to breakfast on his players card.  So if you have a Station's card don't forget to use it.  Without the card the breakfast buffet I believe runs around $5.00ish.    The server for our table was very friendly and with speed and accuracy our drinks arrived.  The buffet is a rough one for me.  10 years ago when at a buffet I would always challenge myself to eat plate after plate.  Being the simple carb, simple sugar junkie that I am it's an internal battle with myself.  Today I focused on the nothing but breakfast.  The items presented were as fresh as a breakfast buffet could be.  The lady making omelets was all smiles.  Not wanting to overdue it, I just hung back and watch her apply her trade.  Don't forget about the salad bar located in the middle of the serving scheme.  Port side is the salad and the starboard side contains other tasties like fruit and fresh chicken salad.  Inexpensive breakfast served in a chipper atmo.......cool by me."}
{"text":"Here is a different kind of buffet review, and the sort I never thought I'd write. I avoid these places like the plague. FB and RRCasino, though, they did me right. Read along for healthy insights and Pro Elite Tips (PET).   In my three years of visiting and now living in Las Vegas, I had been to two buffets, and Excalibur's was the second, miserable, and last some 36 months ago.  Or so I thought.  But I have taken up sports gambling the past two weeks, went bowling with friends at RedRock a few times, enjoy and have been racking up points on my Station card, and like to get my complimentary Starbucks coffee on Station's Military Mondays. Military Monday's also includes a 2-for-1 (or 50% for a single) deal at their buffet. How could I resist, for about $6? It is my patriotic duty to experiment and attest, so here we are.   My goal: eat breakfast or lunch for cheap, and see how *healthy* I could buffet since I've been on a solid-but-not-depraved health kick for awhile. Is it possible to not be ruined by buffet, but to have it fit your fitness goals? The answer is a solid Yes. RedRock's buffet allows you to. It practically encourages you to. Thanks, buffet coach!  I had numerous greens of all shapes and sizes and preparation styles. Salad and quinoa. Whole squash roasted on a grill. Sautéed mushrooms. I had fish, both cooked salmon and sashimi.  I had a mountain of turkey, cut right in front of me. Their three-bean salad was on point. There was cottage cheese for you protein hounds.   Service was excellent, though hurried because of the holiday crowd. After stating that I was a buffet virgin, my waitress informed me of how to enjoy and to signal her for drinks or that I was done dining. She was sweet. Folks, tip your buffet waitstaff. I had my own carafe of coffee. Oh boy! The atmosphere is nice for a buffet, too. The lighting is soft, design is almost upscale, and the area is open so nothing feels too cramped, even when I had babies and families all around me.   And last, dessert.  I did *try* to keep things healthy, but again, I feel obligated to sample and report to eager readers. I had three scoops of gelato: mint, coffee, and chocolate. They have several others. The mint left something to be desired, but the choco and coffee were dandy. I tried two pie slices, which are presented whole in an easy-to-view case. The lemon merengue was a bit too tart, but I was impressed with its toasted-top appearance. The chocolate cream pie was quite good, though a bit light on the chocolate and heavy on a somewhat gummy crust.   All this worked so well into my weekly diet that I am making it a point to go every Monday now. It fits the budget easily, and I max out my macros and other nutrients in no time.  Give it a shot. Dollar-for-product, it's a steal.    **The PET are short and sweet, and I would hope intuitive for the average diner: 1 - don't go on a holiday and expect this place to be empty. I mean...come on. It will be packed, and loafers will lounge and take up space forever, and waitstaff will be ever-busy. Don't be surprised by this. 2 - For AYCE, the price is right to begin with considering what they offer, but take advantage of various discounts, especially for veterans.   3 - You can absolutely eat a pile of healthy food here and feel good about going buffet; choices were better than many garbage dedicated vegetarian spots in this city."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good place to eat. The line was long, but worth the wait. We ate there the day after Christmas"}
{"text":"The price is fine. Food is average. I arrived at 1:30pm and was seated right away. Server was very friendly and brought my my drinks right away."}
{"text":"I went on Sunday around 4pm for dinner.  Salmon and sea bass were both really fresh, and Salmon is not too over-cooked or dry.  I got the buy one get one dinner coupon from myvegas, considering paid $14 for 2 dinner.  Have cocktail shrimp, some mixed olives.  The food is not bad for the price, and their sushi taste even better than Aria, or wicked spoon. They have the Mongolian stir fry dish, but I was too full to try any.  If you like crab, this is not the place for you, I didn't see any.   I don't like crab anyway, so I don't really care."}
{"text":"I went on Monday around 1pm for dinner.  Fish were really fresh.  I got the 2 free breakfast or lunch coupon from myvegas, if not you pay $8.99 for weekdays lunch.  Had some mixed olives.  The food is not bad for the price, and their sushi taste even better than Aria, or wicked spoon.  What I tried and liked including the following: sweet and sour chicken, sui mai, turkey, hummas, greek cucumber yogurt, pineapple, pineapple juice, grilled summer squash, smoked pork, and varies salads. If you like crab, this is not the place for you, I didn't see any.   I don't like crab anyway, so I don't really care."}
{"text":"First there was a long line, stepping up to the cashier, seeing her very unfriendly face, then to the table, where we waited for the server to get our drinks,  she never came,  hostess had to get our drinks,  then the drink order was wrong,  got coffee, no cream, waved at another server,  she looked straight at me and totally ignored me, by the time cream came,  coffee was cold, selection of food was terrible,  no way are we going back ever"}
{"text":"First time we've been here since it changed hands and is no longer a station, we weren't sure what to expect.....it's been totally awesome!! $5.99 with players card (can't beat that), lots of selection but watch out for the omelette guy, Jose, he's a tricky one! You ask for easy cheese & he'll give 1 little shred of it, ask for lots of cheese & he'll make it look like he's giving you 3 scoops of it!! The best way to start the day is with a good laugh & he definitely did that!!! Thanks Jose the omelette was delicious! My husband & I are looking forward to our next \"ditch work & sneak off to breakfast\" day."}
{"text":"Worst buffet I've ever been to!  Between my girlfriend and I, we tried 95% of their offerings, and nearly everything was either flavorless, overcooked or old.  Literally the best items we had were the salads we made ourselves and the sour cream that came from a container.  The service was lacking and inconsistent with other tables in our area, and the service at the dessert station was unfriendly, uncaring, and nearly non existent. Even the coffee was undrinkable at this place. On our way out I asked to speak with the manager, and when I told Edward about our miserable experience he didn't show the slightest concern. I told him I'd never return and he wished me a goodnight. What a joke.  If this buffet were the only \"food\" establishment open for a thousand miles in the Nevada desert, I'd opt to eat sand. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Checked this place out because of BuzzFeed. I thought it was a great price. Loved the food and bottomless champagne. I tried the sushi and was pleasantly surprised! The orange chicken and roast beef were my favorite. I wish they had Mac n cheese, but other than that it was great .  Definitely coming back here again and would recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of buffets; I think they're kind-of a guy thing, but I loved this one. Breakfast is the best time to go. It's cheap and the omelettes are excellent! I really like that the food is separated by culture. They have an Asian section, Mexican, Italian, American, etc. Every time I've been it's been busy so there is a wait, but the staff is very efficient so it's quick. If you're  local you can buy a station card and get a discount :)"}
{"text":"Been coming here for last 6 years and never had a problem. Food is always fresh, lots to choose from and staff are super friendly. Great local location and remember to always use your players card!"}
{"text":"Update:  they have hit bottom.  Don't get it.  They put up the effort and they fall flat.  There are a plethora of great recipes that can be done on the cheap but they don't seem to bother. The salad bar, fresh burgers and their chili soup are pretty good but the majority of their cooked dishes don't make average.  I don't get it and apparently the chefs don't also.   Their pizza is for the trash.  The dough is no good and is oily.  Their dessert choices are poor and have deteriorated over the years.  One guy behind the counter couldn't even understand if something was sugar free when asked!(something critical for diabetics)!!  Not even basic english skills!  How do they get this job? Also, I don't see the \"love\" when they say \"we love locals\".   If they did, this buffet at least should have been way better."}
{"text":"As mentioned the buffet is OK and nothing spectacular.  Some days are better than others depending on the daily selections.  Salad bar is very good and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"If you want a mediocre buffet at best with extra salty foods, then this is your spot."}
{"text":"I am seriously disappointed with the food and service! This WAS the Buffet to come to, now... Easy to replace.   Service absolutely disappeared! Our table and the next table went to go find the waitress and our drinks!   Very unfortunate."}
{"text":"I've been to this particular buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner over the past year, and feel it's a solid three stars. The selection is pretty good but dinner has been underwhelming- lunch is your best option.  Breakfast: Typical breakfast buffet selection. On weekends you may luck out and find shrimp and grits, which is done excellently here. Other than that, it's just fine. Nothing in particular stands out.  Lunch: Best time to go, selection is large and you'll have most of the dinner options. Start with massive salad bar, end with a smorgasbord of desserts including a gelato bar. The Mexican food options are surprisingly solid.  Dinner: Underwhelming. Little to differentiate it from lunch options. Seafood selection (my favorite) is limited, sushi quality is comparable to a grocery store, shrimp are small and not very clean.   Service is consistently good, and you can find locals discounts pretty easily. Always surprised by how busy this place is."}
{"text":"Ok, so I definitely love that this buffet is totally cheap like 6.99 I think if you have the player's card and the breakfast is Yum, Yum, Yum!!  I loved everything at the breakfast (spec. the French toast, waffles, frittatas, sauseeg), and of course being a little piggy at the buffet I stayed for the overlap to lunch so I could have the best of both worlds for less than 7, how can you beat that?!"}
{"text":"I already reviewed the Feast Buffet over at Sunset Station, but I decided to compare this place in terms of quality.  It is a step above the Sunset location, but still pretty ho-hum in terms of buffets.  The selection is wide, but not all items are created equal.  I stayed close to the Americana section; the prime rib was good (as it usually is) and I liked the flavor of the BBQ chicken.  But the real gem here is the dessert section...remember to leave room so you can indulge in the ice cream, milkshakes and a variety of pies and cakes.  I hear this place has a good breakfast variety, but I just can't convince myself to get up that early to stuff myself with food.  Pooh on me."}
{"text":"Wow my sister and I ate for only 17 dollars because we had a buy 1 get free coupon.  This buffet has a little of everything  Italian ,oriental, barbecue, international, Mexican food. I had a salad and humus freshly made along with chicken jambalaya. Finally for desert ice cream mint n chip and cheese cake. Dollar for dollar the best deal in vegas."}
{"text":"If you're a local, make sure to pick up a player's card to get a discount.  Went right before breakfast ended, paid breakfast price, but also got to have some lunch! For how busy the flow was overall, the servers did awesome. Haven't tried the weekend menu yet, but love the dessert options. It has a decent selection and variety: Italian, American, Japanese, Mexican, you name it. For the price and the quality of the food, I'd say it's worth a visit.   Oh, and if you play Pokémon Go, it's a pokestop ;)"}
{"text":"You have to sign up for some casino rewards card for the advertised price, the atmosphere is old and ugly to say the least. The greeter people are rude and see no value of customer retention."}
{"text":"5 stars for the cooked and seasoned crab legs. The lady that cooks it is freaking awesome. Side note: I hate it when people stand in line to get their crab legs cooked and then they have their people get 5 additional plates and then when it comes time, they have 6 plates that need to be cooked. It's rude because the people standing in line only have 1 plate each. I'm throwing down next time for sure."}
{"text":"Had dinner on weeknight with a party of ten here recently.  It was fairly busy but wait time in line and to get a table for our large party was less than ten minutes.    Food was surprisingly not too bad quality wise.  I was happy they had sesame balls (Buchi) that were just deep fried and split pea soup. .that's rarely served in restaurants. The salad bar had variety of pasta salads but was lacking in fresh fruit. All the stations were clean and well maintained everything was hot. IM NOT a fan of buffets in the first place so I checked the SNHD inspection record of this place first and was relieved to see not only an A grade but ZERO demerits.   Staff did great and kept up with keeping our glasses filled and our tables cleared.  Our out of town guests were impressed overall. Spent less than $90 with players card and 2/1 coupons. .great deal for feeding 10 people. Overall I was happy that dining here turned out to be good choice to make and won't hesitate to suggest the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station again."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to hit up the Red Rock Feast Buffet for thier Thanksgiving buffet.  The buffet cost $25 and was billed as gourmet--it was not. We live in the north west and have visited the Aliante buffet on a normal night and could see no difference (besides some paltry shrimp) between the two buffets. After waiting in line for 2 hours, while the Red Rock let multiple tables sit empty, we were very dissapointed in the spread. It was the same spread as a normal weekend night only at twice the cost. I wish we would have spent the time to drive to Green Valley Ranch, the only \"locals\" buffet I have actually enjoyed and found worth going back to. For Thanksgiving this buffet was the same price as the Red Rock and I suspect was much closer to gourmet."}
{"text":"A bit of a drive from the strip, this place has it all. I'm probably the last person who needs to be going to a buffet, as I have virtually no impulse control and can't ever really tell when I'm full, but this place was the best I've seen.  Highlights sadly do not include the sushi, which I usually run to first, as it wasn't refreshed very often and didn't seem to have much variety- there were probably three rolls out the entire time we were here, and we took our time. Oh well- plenty of sushi places in vegas for me to overlook this minor detail.  The highlights DO include some large and meaty meatballs, large calzone slices, some thai chicken dish that seemed to be an experiment but tasted amazing, barbecue, and about a million salads.  But none of that compares to the shrimp and cheddar grits. I would go back JUST for these grits. As it is, I probably had three servings, which is now reflected in my ongoing battle with the scale. But they were damn amazing. If there are any grits when you go, try them. I don't care if you think you don't like grits: you haven't had these.  EDIT: downgrading rating due to inconsistency.  I've also yet to see the shrimp and grits dish again."}
{"text":"My first buffet in Henderson.  It was decent, a pretty standard buffet selection with Asian, Italian, American and \"International\" (Mexican) stations to choose from.  I'm a big fan of their brisket.  I should have saved more room for dessert though, because they served real ice cream there!  Definitely the highlight of the visit...I wish I could have been back for more servings.  Overall, not as good as some of the buffets on the strip, but it's a fairly inexpensive place close to home."}
{"text":"Avoid if you can Dinner prices are quite high for the quality. Poor variety and the quality is not great. Most food was cold/warm and not tasty at all"}
{"text":"I visited this buffet after church with my sons and this was our 1st time going here it was really nice and very nice atmosphere the food was delicious because it was after church it was during the brunch hourd at that time they were serving mimosas and champagne which was very good the host that we had at our table was delightful the atmosphere wonderful I really enjoyed this Buffet so my suggestion is yes go visit the Feast Buffet at the Santa Fe casino it is really really nice you will enjoy it!!"}
{"text":"Seafood Friday at green valley is so worth  it!!!! The way the lady cooks and seasons the crab and shrimp is amazing!  So worth the wait in her line!!!! The rest of the selection isn't bad either.  Lots of different seafood options. Definitely a must!"}
{"text":"As far as Feast Buffets go, Red Rock has the best one. Love the omelette bar, salad bar, assortment of breads and desserts.   Not the best food you've ever had but it's the best you'll find at the $12 -$20 range. Definitely a wide variety of food and attentive servers who never leave your glass empty.   Champagne Brunch (on the weekends) is the way to go. If you haven't already, sign up for the boarding pass (near Starbucks at the food court) for discounts, it's free.   Newly added: All You Can Drink Beer & Wine for $5.99 (with boarding pass). $6.99 without. Bottoms Up!"}
{"text":"Always been subpar, but we always have comps for free.   It is not even edible for free.  I joke my diet plan is the buffet.  I don't even eat anything more than not.  Today, I finally complained (again) to the line staff, called the manager over and she just looked at me and said she couldn't reverse points (I had a voucher and didn't ask for any refund at all).  She then says she can give me a comp for one, there were two of us and I don't want a refund of my (free) dinner.  I want edible food that isn't dried out, crusty, mystery tasting with unidentifiable flavors that don't belong and food so unappetizing looking you don't put it on the plate. I select a few foods and can't even eat them.  Fried chicken dried out, baked beans taste like straight vinegar, didn't plate dried and crusty mac and cheese.   Go back to try and get a second plate of food and watch them put \"fresh\" spaghetti on top of old dried out spaghetti, same for fries.  Plucked a \"fresh\" fry from top and taste for freshness and they are old and crusty.  Another lady asked for a refill on fried chicken and with a bad attitude says he will check.  Goes and grabs already made pan from back that is not for fresh.  This had been years.  We don't go there except when it is free and it is still not worth it.  I'm about to just use my points so that I won't even be tempted to go there.  Stations also has zero customer service ever!  Stop monopolies in vegas!   It is killing customer service and quality control.  Half of what they were doing I am sure is against health code....refilling dirty pans and leaving food set out too long."}
{"text":"I really love this place clean and verity of food and waiters always helping and coming to check on you and not expensive at all recommend eat here :) Especially getting a players card comes out cheaper , people here are very nice and courteous and polite always trying to accommodate your needs :)"}
{"text":"Came here with other friends because they had 2-4-1 offers.  It was OK.  On the whole, the quality at the Feast Buffets at all the Station properties has gone down substantially.  Is it worth it?  Yes, if you've got a discount.  Otherwise you can skip it.  Take the drive and go to the Studio B at M Resort.  Way better"}
{"text":"Boy has this gone down hill!  Went last night and it was a disappointment.  No shrimp or prime rib.  Just chicken and veg and cheap stuff like popcorn shrimp.  The service left alot to be desired too.  My suggestion...spend the extra money and time and go either to Green Valley Ranch or Red Rock.  MUCH better.  If you don't want a locals casino head to the Wicked Spoon art the Cosmopolitan.  Much more money, but worth it.  I wouldn't bother with this buffet unless you get a fr  coupon for a free one."}
{"text":"A-OK.  For the money, the price is great and right when I went they had a $3 off with your players' card. So it was $13.99 instead of $17 So I was happy. It's good comfort food. Yes the prime rib was actually really great. And the price for Vegas is right there in the midrange but for midrance food the quality is better. Some shrimp. Respectable size, not the itty bitty kind. An okay selection at the dessert bar, gelato bar, same.  Service staff attentive and at the ready when needed. My only gripe was that I found it weird that they have plastic glasses. It just seemed cheap to me. I mean I'm not asking for stemware but geez.  Anyway, no crab legs, but it's all pretty good. Good atmosphere. Even though you have to drive a bit out there to get there. Worth a look. Maybe not a return trip, but whatevs. It's nice in there as well as the casino. And you could always find security biking around in there. A good sign."}
{"text":"This place is one of our go-to off strip buffet places.  It's a part of the Station Casinos branches and it's one of the la-di-da hotels of the group.  The food is good, it's not Bachannal, but the food is good. That have an array of decent food choices and they taste good. Their desserts have a good display and they're made and cooked deliciously. They are decadent. The staff are all friendly and efficient, at least when we go there, their performances are on point.  It's a place that I recommend to locals and visitors. It's not one of the voted Best Buffet in Las Vegas but it's a good place to go to."}
{"text":"Buffet quality was below average. There was a selection of fresh carved meat, yet the already made/cooked foods looked old. The Chinese food regarding taste, fell very short. The desserts were OK, nothing that sparked my interests.  I was only impressed by the excellent staff and the free mimosas given during breakfast.   I would say try a different location for the FEAST Buffet, only because I have tried other station casinos and they were better than GVR's buffet."}
{"text":"They could spruce up the salad bar with a few other items.    The carving station was pretty good .     Service is good.   Desserts are not fresh or tasty.     Other station buffets are much better Quality and variety."}
{"text":"Not happy at all! The food choices are below mediocre. Shrimp was not fresh. Asian section has food that looked like it has been there for days. The grill section does have sirlion but it was a bit tough. The italian section has limited choice of spaghetti meat balls and that sausage with sauce. American section has fried chicken that looks like 3x fried. Even the tempura doesnt taste fresh.  The dessert section is ok.  The stars i gave is for the location and neatness of the place. Definitely will not go back, i would rather spend my $ in a burger joint."}
{"text":"My brother and I ate here for dinner.  We thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service was great! Nice selection. Great value for money!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan and a regular at this location, Feast Buffet inside the Sunset station casino. I love the Veteran Monday get one free buffet. They exhibit love and support to the veterans and active duty military personnel and being a veteran myself, I advocate places like these. The alone gave them my 5star rating.  Our regular hostesses, Yvonne, Cathy, and Miss K are all very pleasant to spend time with and they are very attentive and kind.  The food is good and since we frequent this place during breakfast, I love their breakfast menu and the unlimited coffee is amazing!  I recommend this off strip buffet to everyone! Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch is the ONLY reason to come! Brunch is from 8am-4pm on Sunday only!  Cost, $9.99 with players boarding pass, and if you are a local and get the monthly mailer from Sunset Station, you have a few buy one get one free buffet coupons, making it really only $5.00 a person for all you can eat!  not too bad of a deal!  we have only really waited in line once, and normally show up between 9am-10am and wait only 5 min... maybe!  A HUGE plus for the brunch..... FREE MIMOSAS!!!!!!  They took the free mimosas away for a while, but as of yesterday, they were back!  My fav is the hand made omelet station.  They have two people making them at separate sides of the buffet, but i always have Ricardo make mine, he is amazing and seems to always remember his customers.  He is on the Asian station side, the other person is next to the desserts.  Its a great deal, and every time my family is out here to visit, we always have Sunday Brunch!"}
{"text":"Previous reviews on this joint are quite eclectic. It's practically unpredictable to judge yourself if you haven't been there yet but I made my judgment and a good one.  Go get a \"boarding pass\" (player's card for Station Casino(s)) and your buffet rates will be discounted. I went for the Sunday brunch at about $10. For the price, this is probably the best buffet I have ever been to as of yet. Not only is there a large selection but the quality is great. I started with the omelette here and it was very well cooked and the line for the food is organized. I like how the cook took orders in line, that way, she knows who went first and anyone who tries to cut, she boots them off for me rather than me booting them off. Surprisingly, there wasn't prime rib which was a bit of a shocker. Especially since it breaks the Las Vegas buffet norm of serving it.   The service was decent. Because there was such a high volume of customers, it was understandably difficult. Especially since they were serving champagne.   If I had to take an out of town visitor to a buffet, I would take him/her to this. This buffet is sure enough to make them happy financially and internally."}
{"text":"Good buffet , very spacious so you can enjoy your party and not feel apart of the party next to you . Very friendly customer service & helpful . Waitress kept table clear of plates at all times & very nice her name was Tammy , the bartender was even a joy made me laugh every time I got a glass of wine his name was Chris . The food was decent for the price and for a buffet , I think my favorite was Asia then Italy . The salad bar was fresh and had a lot of varieties , Tammy told us Sunday is Salmon night so I'll have to go back on a Sunday night to experience it again . Definitely recommend it"}
{"text":"The food here is awesome and it is cheaper than many other buffets. The staff keep the plates cleared off the tables. Even when it is very busy the servers are good to keep drinks filled. The line is a little long at prime eating times but they move you along quickly. Well worth the wait. Highly recommend the 25 min drive off the strip. Tons of other stuff to do at this casino."}
{"text":"I can say that this is the best buffet I've been to. The prices are great and they have amazing food. The variety of food is great and the quality is too. They have a lot of pastries and desserts. I wish I went more than once during my trip. My dad said he'd drive just to Vegas just to eat there! LOL"}
{"text":"VERY affordable buffet at a high end casino/hotel. DON'T let the prices fool you, as everything from the scrambled eggs to the country fried steak is absolutely A-MA-ZING. Also, keep an eye out for the waitress, Linda. You can tell just by looking at her that she's very nice and VERY genuine, which is a rare find."}
{"text":"This made up for the horrible Gold Coast buffet I tried. RR had great variety and flavors, and freshly cooked food. The babaganoush was delicious...as well as the bbq and Chinese ribs. Salmon was perfectly cooked, with a crispy skin...I will say the dessert was not a large section, but so good. Spumoni gelato was fantastic, and the passion fruit tapioca was so yummy. Maybe they should give the Gold Coast pointers on keeping food fresh!"}
{"text":"I only gave 2 stars because I've had breakfast or brunch here before and it wasn't too bad. Dinner on the other hand, yuck! Do not pay full price for this dinner buffet! Ever. The food was mediocre at best. The mexican & Asian selections were pathetic. I guess if you like fatty, rare cooked pieces of beef, this might be the buffet for you. I'm a fatty and can usually get in a few good trips at a buffet, I was almost ashamed of myself for not even finishing 2 plates."}
{"text":"It's a small buffet, with typical buffet-type food and quality. It's not the Bellagio buffet, and you're not going to find any exotic concoctions or pre-peeled shrimps here.   It's well worth the $7.99 price tag though.  Hell, you can't get McDonald's or Chipotle for that.  Drink refills were a little less than prompt, but I enjoyed the meal and wouldn't hesitate to go back again.  It's as good as several of the more expensive buffets on the strip in the same quality and size range.  There is a free shuttle that runs between Palace Station and the Fashion Show Mall on the strip about every 90 minutes."}
{"text":"Had a great time with fam bam great service bottomless mimosafor sunday brunch fav spot to go to after church"}
{"text":"At first I was surprised at the low ratings for this place but as I read other reviews, many compare it to high end buffets in Vegas which in my opinion isn't fair. Example, if a buffet is charging $40+, I expect quality and selections to be up to par.   But for $5.99 for breakfast (except Sun & with club card), its cheaper than IHOP, Carrows, Hometown etc. and you also get varieties along with an Omelette station! I'm not going to complain.  For lunch its ONLY $6.99 (except Sun and with club card) and the food is descent with good amount of choices along with a burger and pasta bar!!! I have tried many buffets (low and high end) and as a low cost/lower end buffet, I really LOVE their pasta bar the best for lunch. Honestly, the pasta here taste better than the same/similar selections you get at Olive Garden. My favorite is the pasta with garlic, olive oil and lots of clams and then the spaghetti & meatballs with marinara  mix with a little Alfredo sauce, yummy! You can totally modify it with spinach etc added. Just delicious! I would get lots of vegetables to eat with this and other choices.   Generally, if I'm craving Omelettes, I would come here instead of an IHOP etc. If I want pasta, I would come here instead of Olive Garden. If you want a few simple items, nothing too fancy without spending a lot of money, then this would be the place to be. Unless you the ambiance etc, you wont find it here but when your paying between $5.99-$7.99 and $9.99 for Sunday brunch, there shouldn't be anything to complain about.  Service: Is good 80% of the time.  Wait time: Believe it or not, A LOT of people come here (that tells you something), so try to go earlier before prime time hits."}
{"text":"Great price and decent food selection. Discount available if you have Player's Card.  $6.99 Breakfast $8.99 Lunch"}
{"text":"My rating is a 3.5.  I'm rounding up because of the great service we got from the server.   We came here for lunch the day after Thanksgiving.  The place itself is beautiful for a casino. The trendy orange lamps. high irregular acoustic ceiling to help disperse smoke,  and earth tone carpets and unusual chair colors makes this a quirky and contemporary place. Though I love today's music, their muzak system plays sing a long classic hits from the 60s, 70s, and 80s.  They know that the 30-60 year olds got the cash.  The buffet is smack dab in the middle of the casino.  The cost per person at lunch is $10, but they gave us a discount for $2 off if we return in December. We hope to go after Christmas, and that there won't be as many people burping, slurping, and inhaling their food. I guess that's a good sign when people in several tables don't talk and just get serious eating.  It's clean and spacious. Some dishes, like any buffet looked dry and limp, like some of the melons, salads, and veggie dishes  They had a nice station for prime rib and ham.  My brother got a great looking piece of rare prime rib, just like he orders when in a steak restaurant.  However, the meat was cold because the server cuts a large piece from the roast from which he cuts other pieces.  I asked for the rarest slice he could give me, but that slab was medium well.  Also there were only two seafood dishes, shrimp and veggies and a poached tilapia dish.    Then,  I took a lot of time to look at every section - Salad Bar, American, Chinese, BBQ, Mexican, and Desserts. I was very picky but really enjoyed what I got.  The sweet vinegar cabbage salad was kind of plain but fresh, the Chinese veggies had baby bok choy, Chinese peas, cabbage, and carrots that was just freshly put out.  The rice pilaf was buttery with pieces of peas and carrots but no browned  noodles.  The collard greens with bacon wasn't quite like Johnny Rebs, but it was decent. Their best veggie was the moist and sweet baked in skin yams.   Then I hit the desserts, and opted for the pumpkin ice cream and spumoni.  I also got one of these mini tiramisu cups.  Not bad. They had many kinds of pies and cakes, including some that were no sugar added. Their display case looked pretty good.  The whole time the server was quick to take out dirty plates and bring drink refills - they didn't ask you, they just brought them..  Overall, I enjoyed eating, being with family, and hearing classic hits.  Some of the items didn't look that great, but I enjoyed what I did get. It was sweet that after lunch, my relatives won money in the penny machines...enough to pay for the lunch we had twice over."}
{"text":"It's a love/hate relationship.  I love this buffet because the food is always good and there is a great selection to choose from. Also, for the month of August, they have a 2-for-1 special going on for Boarding Pass members.  What I *hate* is the awful line and wait. My family got to the buffet line at around 5:10pm (pretty early for dinner) and we didn't get seated until 6:20pm!!! This is pretty standard as I have waited similar times in the past but UGH, I'm hungry!!!!  Not only are you waiting in the 3rd class stewage line (not staying at the hotel or have mucho $$$ to upgrade your Boarding pass) you have to compete with the lines of the hotel guests and Stations High Rollers to get a seat!  I read from previous yelp posts that they do not have enough servers to fulfill the demand. UH! Vegas is one of the most unemployed cities, open up these serving jobs so I can stuff myself and dance in gluttony faster!!!!"}
{"text":"We came here twice for breakfast as it was included in our Groupon purchase to stay at Green Valley Ranch. They have your typical breakfast buffet items.  The sausage, bacon and hash browns are good.  They have an omelet station but it looked like the wait was long.  Skip the eggs Benedict, they had a funny taste.  They didn't have the \"expensive\" items like roast beef or lox for breakfast.  Ketchup was never at the table and we always had to ask for it. They have separate lines for hotel guest and players to avoid the crowds. Players also get a discount. The servers were nice and got our drinks quickly."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times I was disappointed. At dinner, everything was dry/stale like it had been sitting there all day. The fried shrimp were not deveined either. Gross. At breakfast, everything lacked flavor and the eggs were so watery I'm guessing they were made from powder.  I will not go back to this buffet. It's inexpensive, but even that couldn't make up for the state of the food."}
{"text":"Food here is subpar, but it's what I expect from a buffet. I never felt like getting another of any item after trying most of it because it wasn't that tasty. The only things I really enjoyed was the shrimps and the desserts. Everything else just tasted ok. I would give it less stars, but for a Las Vegas buffet the price is decent. If I was in the area and really hungry I would go here again, but if my budget doesn't limit me then I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went on Google to find the top inexpensive buffets in Vegas. Feast Buffet at Boulder Station Hotel & Casino was the first buffet they suggested. $5.99 for breakfast with players card (free) and $7.99 for lunch. The first day we went for lunch and I was NOT disappointed.  The second day we went for breakfast, again, was NOT disappointed. Even the slots paid well. Make sure to play Willy Wonka penny slot."}
{"text":"Always come for the breakfast buffet. I love the French toast and the fresh fruit. The waitresses are always nice to deal with.  Being a club member you sometimes get deals in the mail for buy one get one free and that always makes it nice. Breakfast is 8-10:30"}
{"text":"Visited the first week of June. Breakfast was outstanding- every kind of breakfast meat including carved ham and  chicken fried steak and gravy. Made to order omelets, eggs benedict, waffles, French toasts, potatoes, cheese blintz with fruit toppings. Fresh fruit, oatmeal- cream of wheat, grits- with raisins and brown sugar- salads- a bagel section with several flavors and cream cheese flavor choices.  Too much to choose!  Plus served both coffee and a huge glass of O.J.  for $6.99 with the players card a steal! Came right near the end of the breakfast so lunch items coming out and got to try some of those too.   Lunch was very good on another day. Stand outs were the turkey, stuffing, carved ham and stuffed pork. fall off the bone BBQ chicken, beef stew- Lots of salad choices- Mexican- chicken enchiladas, menudo, quesadillas- all the fixings you could ask for !  Hot and sour soup.. soups- ( sushi- don't eat it but lots of people were..) pasta, masala chicken, tortellini- nice sauces.. Oh, and save room for the coconut or banana or chocolate cream pies- toffee pudding was to die for- gelatos.. so much to eat- great selection and all for $8.99 a person.    Something for everyone. Lines go fast- worth the short wait.  Service was prompt- friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"For the price and quality of the prime rib here. 16.99 on a Saturday ? Can't beat that and the meat was so tender and juicy. Especially if u can get a coupon book then it's bogo free. Superrrrrr deal!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great, service was wonderful, big difference from garbage we have experienced on the strip!"}
{"text":"With all the buffets in Vegas, it's really not hard to overeat. The Feast Buffet is located in the Red Rock Resort, an insanely gorgeous and large casino. The prices are amazing for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. My mom and I received coupons in the mail, so I think we went for dinner for around $12 each. An incredible deal.  The Feast Buffet deserves a 5/5 for price, decor, and service. Compared to the over $60 dinner meal at Bacchanal, this is such a steal. The line to get in at around 5:15 PM on a weekday was about twenty minutes long, but it does move pretty fast. Variety is pretty equal to other buffets I've been to. You have a salad bar, pizza, Italian, Chinese, American, etc. However, most of the food isn't labeled, so just beware.   The food probably was the worst part. Most of the things I tried I didn't even finish. The sushi tasted really old, the fried foods were way overfried, the dessert was subpar. Some of the meats were too tough. The dessert was subpar. There's a large variety of pastries, pies, and gelato, but the pistachio gelato was pretty gross.   I'm not from the Vegas area, but if I ever go back, I probably won't come here for dinner!"}
{"text":"It's not very good. The best thing you can say is that it's cheap. You get what you pay for as it goes. Some of the food tasted as though it was cooked days ago. The prime rib for some strange reason had the flavor of rubber. It looked good, it was tender but the rubber taste was sort of odd. Certain items were good such as the spare ribs but all in all it's pretty much sub par."}
{"text":"As I sit here and write this I am feeling sick to my stomach. We went there on a free comp we had. We arrived during breakfast time and were highly pleased with breakfast. Lunch was fixing to start and we were excited to see what options we had.   They have a hamburger grill as a lunch option. As hubby walked up to order a burger he said they had the patties in a pan of water on the grill (I guess cooking them) and then they placed the burger on the grill for 30 seconds then handed it to him. Needless to say the burger was raw.   Other lunch items were inedible and we were highly disappointed. The small things we did eat for lunch quickly made us all feel ill and we were done.  Now as I sit here sick to my stomach I think this free comp was a waste. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Sadly I have to say not to much of a fan. I always go to the Green Valley Buffet and love it and we wanted to change the scenery so we thought to try them out. We went for breakfast. The staff from the Cashier to the waitress were very rude. The Cashier instead of handing my husband back his debit card and player card she smacked it down on the counter. We never got refills on our drinks and in fact only saw her twice.  My blueberry muffin was HARD. I tried the Red Velvet pancakes with cream cheese. YUK!! Hard as a rock and the cheese did not taste right. No one cared to listen to us regards to it so we left. NEVER to return"}
{"text":"This is a review for weekday breakfast buffet.  I stopped by the players club booth to get a players card to get the discount on my breakfast buffet for $6.99.  For just under $7, this is probably one of the best (if not the best) values in Las Vegas.  The cashiers, waitstaff and the hosts were all professional.  You get plenty of variety with all the continental breakfast fares and a formidable omelet station.  I highly recommend the weekday breakfast."}
{"text":"Must hit the omelet station and the prime rib.  Always save room for dessert"}
{"text":"I never leave any reviews on yelp  Here it's so ridiculous we came here with 4 adults and 2kids 1 is 3 years old and 7 years old  the price is $34.99 with play card  And they charge a kid 3yrs old $34.99  And I asked them there any price for kids and they said yes  Then I asked how much for a kid $34.99 and I asked what a difference adult and kid?? They said $1. Discount ... it's sucks Do Not Come here . I wish I could leave zero star for a manager also"}
{"text":"Buffet was great. If u sign'd up for one of there club cards u got it at a great price. All the waiters were nice and smiled at u while taking ur drink order and checked on us frequently. Food was great had everything I liked on the buffet and then some. I never got to make it to the dessert station. I be back for that tho."}
{"text":"Through the whole meal i couldn't help but to think 'Wow the chow hall back on the Marine Corps Air Station where i spent 3 years of my enlistment tasted a whole lot better then this'  When you first walk in they have a buffet style of various beers, be warned the beer is a lie you still have to pay for it. This kind of pissed me off the way they displayed it but have a small note card barely readable until up close with prices.  Sushi was dry both fish and rice which most likely means it sat out for a while, Everything was borderline meh to okay from a place like the Red Rock i was expecting at least good to great.   Nothing displayed really stood out from the other buffets, very bland, tastes like you would expect from a massed produced menu  If i ever go here again i'll be thinking about the Chow Hall..."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite buffets. Went for Saturday lunch. Noticed price increase now its champagne brunch, thought ok we will try it.  Other than serving champagne it still seemed the same food wise.   The food was fresh and had a good selection. The lines for omelettes can be a bit long. Nice selection of fresh fruit, great salad bar lots to choose from.  Our server was nice altho we did have to request refills on our iced tea.  Overall the lunch is worth the price."}
{"text":"$15 weekend brunch includes free champagne!  We came here for brunch last weekend and found that they incorporated a \"Well & Being\" section with food offerings dedicated to vegan, vegetarian, gluten friendly, and dairy free diets! The lady in front of me in line pulled the chef aside to ask him if the pancakes were gluten free. When he said \"absolutely\" she smiled and said it was the best thing she had heard all day.   I had the vegetarian Polenta and Eggs Benedict, Egg White Sopes, and some sort of root vegetable quesadilla. Many dishes were being cooked right behind the buffet line showing how fresh it really is (unlike other buffets with their mystery food in trays from the back). With the fruit, soup, and salad bar, as a Vegetarian, I definitely got my money's worth.   My husband made his own steak and eggs by ordering two easy eggs and put in over a giant top round steak. He was content with his creation.   With Station Casino player's cards you get two-for-one offers here about 6 times a year on the mail.   Did I mention the free champagne on weekends?!"}
{"text":"For a $6.99 lunch at 3:30 was a deal instead of In and Burger down the street. Use your free players / boarding pass card for this discounted price.  We got in around 3:30 for lunch and finished my first sampling when dinner service starting coming out. The food for lunch was okay, Chinese food with orange chicken and beef, fried beef noodles, dumplings..meah.. Fried chicken and collard greens were pretty good. Taco bar was a good set up.  But, when dinner was setting up with a pasta bar, turkey, prime rib, clams, rappilini it was aallll good. Couldn't eat any more, just trying a little of each.  Maybe 3 1/2 stars for this buffet in smaller Casino. Can't beat $10 buffet.  I'll be back"}
{"text":"It is not worth the price to go on Sundays during \"brunch\". There is barely any selection. We waited almost 1 hr and 30 minutes to be seated only to have terrible service.  Once seated, we asked for Sierra Mist and was given soda water. I understand the machine being broken or something. So we asked for it to be checked and our drinks replaced. Once again we got soda water and that was the last time we saw our server. Even after we asked for a water refill. I ended asking the hostess to replace our drinks. She stated that she would bring me a small cup to test the soda from the other side, and more water. She never did so, and three times she came near us and avoided eye contact. Sunset buffet is the worst station casino buffet; and I can say this after being there several times."}
{"text":"When you move into your new apt and the previous tenants leave a coupon in the mailbox and the ultimate come up presents itself before you. Yes it was a 2 for 1 coupon to the feast buffet at sunset station... Quality eats for a buffet...chinese food...Italian food...Meat slicing station...caucasian food... All good and to be honest the 2 for 1 was a blessing from the food good because me and the family got full af for under $20   Oh fyi you gotta have a sunset station pass to get the 2 for 1 coupon"}
{"text":"As of late 2015, the Feast Buffet at Palace Station may be the most underrated buffet in Las Vegas - and the best-priced when you sign up for the obligatory Stations Boarding Pass.  For $11 including tip, you get a decent salad bar (do give the greens more than a quick once-over; I have occasionally found Romaine that's beginning to get black on the edges), a fair selection of foods (i.e., DIY taco station, pizza, Chinese dishes, American comfort foods), and a well stocked dessert station.  Also, despite the price, there is a credible carving station that rotates between roast turkey, ham, roast beef, corned beef, and even the occasional bona fide prime rib (same quality you'd have in the restaurant downstairs).  Service is attentive.  The dining room has been remodeled in the last few years; ambience is budget, but it's comfortable and well-lit.  Is it the Bacchanal?  Heck no.  But you can feed the whole family for what you'd spend for one person at the Bacchanal."}
{"text":"My review will be the pictures I post. Dried out, shriveled up: Sausage, sweet potatoes, old spinach pizza pizza, and what they want you to feed your kids...hot dogs (if you can still call them that!)... and Pulled pork that had been sitting there for a long time. When I complained, they put more sauce on top instead of changing the product out. I scooped some out to show the dryness of the product underneath.  Santa Fe buffet closed down for a while due to lack of business. They reopened with great food, now the food has again gone down hill and who knows, they may not have learned from the last shut down! See pics..."}
{"text":"I absolutely give Feast Buffet 5 stars...They truly deserve it...My family and I get the most value for our money at Feast Buffet at Sunset Station in Henderson Nevada...The food is topnotch!! I love it so much...I go in for breakfast or brunch often and enjoy the nice variety of breakfast items as well as the delectable lunch menu ( I use a rewards card so I save $1 - $2 per meal ) Which makes my meal cost $6 - $7 and if you go right before lunch..You get to enjoy the vast array of southern...Caribbean...Mexican...Chinese... Italian..American and Mediterrean dishes...Ohh! and just when I thought it was so good...They had to throw in fried plantains!! One of my faves ( As I'm Panamanian ) I have tried two of their other locations..Boulder Station with a family member and ( We weren't fond ) I've also tried Green Valley Ranch... ( Which was okay..But a lil more pricey ) Green Valley Ranch Resort is absolutely Gorgeous!! My advice is go right before lunch and go very hungry! Your tummy will thank you for it...As well as all your senses.*"}
{"text":"Ok buffet.  Nothing to write home about, but good for the points on the players card.  Nothing like a \"free\" meal"}
{"text":"I'm giving this buffet 4 stars because of the $12.99 pricing when you present your player's card.  While they do not have crab legs, they do have shrimp at the salad bar.  The selection is pretty decent also for the pricing.    There is an sections for Italian, American, Mongolian, Chinese, Mexican a carving station , salad bar, and a dessert bar.  Our wait staff has been efficient and our plates and drinks refilled without asking every time we have dined here, (dinner only) which has been about 6 times in the last 30 days.  The won ton soup is actually edible, with the won tons not being overly pasty or foul tasting like I have experienced at several other buffets.  They also offer free house wine which is actually pretty good.  If you want a decent selection with decent quality, try this buffet."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the food hadn't disappointed us at all! The staff are friendly! Small wait in line.... that means lots more folks like the place also! And with your players card the price is right!"}
{"text":"One of the best buffet in Las Vegas!  They have a variety of selections from Italian, Mexican, international, asian, salad etc Service is great here!  The waiter was very mí diff when our Bev was getting low and the plates are always cleared.  Just be mindful, there is a LINE?  So plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Never a bad idea to stop here and pig out, Feast Buffet is a legit buffet with flavorful food, fairly decent service and hours that are convenient. Breakfast, lunch or dinner it's possibly my favorite buffet in Vegas, 2nd to South Point. Choices are wide and great here, options ranging from Chinese, Italian, Latin, American, desserts and huge salad bar.  You'll definitely gain 5lbs here and it'll all be worth it. Worth the visit  Service has varied based on time. Ive experienced 5 min sit times and I've also been completely ignored. It does get busy but there is plenty seating. Become familiar with your servers, changes will happen and you'll be stuck.  **Food quality makes up for everything else**"}
{"text":"I will most likely never return to any Station Casino buffet after last night's experience. The food was below sub-par and they should be embarrassed. But casinos don't get embarrassed as they know there will always be people willing to settle.  It was as though no one in the kitchen knew how to use seasoning on anything. I even had to ask for steak sauce for the prime rib because it had no slow roasted flavor. I tried everything from fish to pizza to Asian - stuffing to mac & cheese.  The only flavor was in the bbq pork on the Asian section. Was I stunned that they used canned jellied cranberry sauce? How about the frozen and probably bought in bulk egg rolls and pot stickers which were so hard they were impossible to eat. I could go on.   I was truly disappointed since I rarely go to buffets and was looking forward to having a little bit of lots. My mistake."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our brunch thanks to Vince. I truly believe that a great server can make or break a restaurant.. Staff here from cashier to line cook are wonderful."}
{"text":"Service was quick at getting us seated and getting our drinks. We came to this one because its closest to my friend's house. The pork was very good, as well as the mashed potatoes. Quite disappointed the other food wasn't all that. The Asian food served wasn't good to me.  I feel the best things they had there was the desert.  They had gelato!  So good.  But, yeah, overall was a bit disappointed.  I think it was about $11.50 when I went around 11:30 AM on Saturday."}
{"text":"we only go here because its the only place that we know of that serves crab legs every night and the ice cream bar, but I like Texas Station's buffets better, it has way more selection, in my opinion...  Anyways, tonight they had a real problem with the food keeping its temperature once it got onto the plate, I wasted so much food because it got so cold...and it wasn't just me, other people were doing it too...also, some sections have a 2 hour limit of eating, which is kind of going against the all-you-can-eat description, its the only place I know of that does that...  The mashed potatoes had something hard in them, the pork ribs had too much sauce, the meatballs got way too cold, way to fast, but the mongolian BBQ was great, although I think there should be more vegetables...the price is fine, since we use our points...i just don't understand the hype about the place, and it seems like they think that menudo is the only Mexican dish that they can serve, and who eats that anyway, selection is really lacking...I'd rather go to Texas Station or try another buffet..."}
{"text":"This buffet has really gone down hill. We have come here for years and I'm disappointed.  The wait staff was great as usual but the line chiefs were rude and the food selection isn't what it once was.  The quality of my food was poor. Pancakes were hard and noodles were not edible.  We will only come here as a necessity when family is in town. Not as a choice."}
{"text":"I'm sitting around 3.5 stars on this.   Feast is a solid buffet choice. I visited on a Thursday and kept my expectations low, keeping in mind that the options would not include all of the bells and whistles that would come with a weekend visit.   That said, I was here for a holiday party and didn't pay for my meal, so I can't speak to pricing. To be honest, I was so hungry that I didn't even look at prices.   The entire area is well maintained. Despite the fact that almost entire party ventured out for food at the same time, the buffet really only felt crowded at the carving station.   The food selection was good and replenished quickly. To my surprise, the standout items were the tom yum soup and the roasted pork shoulder. The soup was served in individual bowls with mushrooms and shrimp. I was happy to find just a bit of heat (I like more, but I still enjoyed the soup as is). However, the biggest surprise was the roasted pork shoulder on the carving station. It was juicy and tender and even came with a bit of skin. It was so very close to lechon that my pork-loving filipino was a bit giddy on the inside. The carving attendant almost scrapped the skin off of my serving, but I quickly begged for every last morsel. I topped some of the pork with chimichurri sauce that I got from the beef carving station and threw it into a roll from the salad. Needless to say, I went back for seconds on both the soup and pork.  The salad and dessert stations were just okay. Pretty standard.   Service, on the other hand, was great. Everyone was attentive. Plates were cleared and soda/water refills were plentiful.   I don't know if I'll back just because it's out of the way for me, but I enjoyed dinner more than I expected. Can't complain."}
{"text":"Not awful, as far as buffets go, but the menu never changes.  It's the same thing over and over.  I can't understand why anyone would eat here every day (and some do.)  Plus, a lot of the food is either high carb or fried.  I can go three months between visits and know what's there.  Yes, it's reasonably priced, but it wouldn't hurt to tweak the menu on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot, probably 4 times a year which is a lot for my family since we dont eat out much. I never had a bad experience and we enjoyed that they send out coupons. When it comes to the food its just average. its not TERRIBLE but i can relate to a few other reviews. the orange chicken is 100% always too dry. the chicken wings are too sweet, but im assuming because its in the Chinese section that its supposed to be that way. the sushi is absolutely terrible. its like eating rubber. all of the basic foods such as pizza, pasta and deserts are always made well and taste great. i favor the bread pudding when i go there. & i really liked how they added a mix in counter for ice cream. Im giving it 2 stars because, they charged my 2 year old $15 dollars. I think its absolutely ridiculous that they charge for toddlers THAT much. I wrote a \"suggestion\" to the casino directly and received no reply so here i am to warn others. It does say on their website \"under 2 are free\" but what the problem is , is the PRICE. my son ate 5 bites of macaroni and cheese that costs pennies to make but i paid $15 for him to sit there and watch youtube after that. They could do with childrens pricing or raise the \"free\" age. Newsflash, toddlers dont eat like adults. It also kind of confused me as to why on the receipt it says \"kids buffet\" when its the same price as an adult one. why have 2 separate buttons for 1 solid price? I probably will not be going back here again because its still bothering me especially since my son turned 2 just a few days prior to that. One thing i forgot to mention above is when i questioned the pricing, all the lady did was say \" i can bring my manager over if you want \" ... but why? prices are prices and we waited 30 minutes in line to eat not realizing they charged for 2 year olds."}
{"text":"I went once for lunch and once for breakfast.  IT IS THE WORSE BUFFET IN VEGAS.  Dry, ugly, limited, unappealing.  There is nothing redeeming about the food here.  the don't even have a good dessert bar..  NO PIE!  DONT EAT HERE!  And no one ever wins at the tables here."}
{"text":"So.... I made the huge mistake of coming to Feast on Thanksgiving Day with a group of friends.  This past Thanksgiving was our first in Vegas without our immediate family, so we thought we would do something fun & hit up a buffet for turkey dinner.  We got there early, around 3:30 p.m., to beat the dinner rush.  Hah! Two and a half hours later, we finally got into the buffet.  Once we all paid, we had to stand around for another 25 minutes waiting on a table to fit our 7 person party.  Once we finally sat down, we all headed to the buffet where we had to stand in line for ANOTHER 30 MINUTES just to get food.  The stations were so backed up, we were all eating in line when we finally got to whatever food we liked.  They were also running out of food.  Never again.  I will never, ever go to another buffet on Thanksgiving Day.  I know this isn't the norm & it was a holiday - yatta, yatta, yatta - but they should have been better prepared.  Next year, we will either be going somewhere that takes reservations or cooking at home.  Normally, this buffet is not that bad.  I've been there once before on a normal day & the service was great.  The food is mediocre.  They do have a lot of stations with a lot of international selections which is cool for people with different tastes.  & with a $10.99 price tag (with your casino rewards card), you can't really beat it.  Obviously, it's no Bacchanal, but it will do for a family who wants choices or the tourists staying at the hotel.  The best part - they have real gelato and it is delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good food and the service is friendly, and quick. It can be pricey but you get what you pay for. The steaks were cook to perfection, very enjoyable evening."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for breakfast but ended up getting to our table just as lunch was changing over.  So we had the best of both worlds, eggs, snausages and bacon, biscuits and gravy all delicious.  Lunch options were even better.   mmmm creamy Mac n Cheese to boot.  They have so many different stations (no pun intended) that it's difficult to choose.   We were impressed with the competent service regarding clearing dishes, the fresh food items and over all experience.  The decor is tasteful too.  Love their gelato selection and the lemon sorbet rocked.  Red Rock Feast Buffet gets 2 thumbs up and we'll be back.  I made a pig out of myself so a nap was in order when I got home, but isn't that what buffets are meant to do?  4 1/2 stars, I would give 5 however my friend asked for a sierra mist and it never came :( easily forgiven."}
{"text":"This buffet was horrible .... food looked old not a lot of variety the only thing that was decent was the service. .... would definitely never recommend this buffet"}
{"text":"Go here for breakfast mostly,  and because it's close to my house. Their breakfast selection is not very good. Repetition of pretty much the same items. The service is extremely slow. There are only two servers that i will ever request. Their lunch menu is a bit more diverse. Their build your own burger station is pretty good. The coffee ice cream is always the highlight of my dining experience."}
{"text":"Hmmm...I always have high hopes for a buffet but then it seems many are just mediocre.  This buffet falls in that category.  The Asian station had good ma po tofu...not a whole lot of flavor but fresh.  The salad bar was fine but again it was just getting by with romaine lettuce and a mixed iceburg lettuce selection (nothing exotic here), standard ranch, blue cheese, thousand island, or Italian dressing and some tired croutons.  The Mexican station has some flavorful refried beans but nothing else really packed a punch....such is the problem with a buffet.  Lacking in flavor and leaving you full of bland food. :(  If you have a coupon or discount I might try it but nothing remarkable IMHO."}
{"text":"This is one of those OK buffets that you would not really write home about - though, I probably will, but then I don't live a very exciting life. But you probably do, so you might want to take a raincheck on this buffet. It's not bad, but for the beautiful Red Rock Casino, I was expecting something a little more special for lunch. They must be saving the good stuff for dinner... at least, we can only hope.   This buffet falls into that category with the Luxor, you know, where you expected something unique, but you only found cafeteria food. Not bad cafeteria food, but you feel a little short-changed. Service just ok.   That's it, I have to go send an email now...... \"Dear Mom, Hope you are fine. Today we went to the Red Rock Buffet. It was good if you like cafeteria food. So, how is your cat?\"."}
{"text":"Decent food. A lot of choices. You get a good value for the money. I always leave full. As long as you get there at the right time, it's worth a try. However, if there are more than 20 people waiting in line, I won't waste my time."}
{"text":"The food was awesome and the staff was wonderful. Kudos to the big guy flipping burgers and slicing meat."}
{"text":"I'm not a buffet fan, but since i didn't have to cook-I came here. It was great the only thing that was I didn't like was the long lines."}
{"text":"Food sucks!!! But service is good!!! This is the worst buffet that I have ever had! I won't come again even it's free!!"}
{"text":"The food here is very well flavored. It is hot and the service is very good. Our server Hugo knows the regulars and still takes care of everyone else. I never had an empty cup on my table and there was never a plate that was not being used piling up. Thanks for the great service Hugo keep it up. Green Valley Ranch Feast Buffet is blessed to have you. The cooks here are friendly and good."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. Went again last night. It's good food for the price. Never had to wait in line too long. Very good service. Love the turkey and roast beef."}
{"text":"Better than I thought it was going to be. Great selection of Asian food and things you wouldn't even find at a typical buffet. Thai Larb, Tom ka kai soup! If you get a players card you get a fairly good discount."}
{"text":"Mediocre to poor food selection and quality. The quality gets half star. Most of rhe food tasted like it was a day old. Selection is decent. If you care about quantity instead of quality, this is your place. The days of quality Vegas buffets are long gone."}
{"text":"I'm only giving 2 stars because the desert was good.  The food was bleh at best.  Potstickers were not cooked all the way and the BBQ pork my husband got was overlooked. The egg rolls were cold and old. This buffet is VERY small! No signs above to notify you of what food is where such as: Asian, American, Italian and so on.  The waitress who took our beverage and coffee order said \"no we do NOT bring a small pitcher of coffee over.\" I asked why, she just kept stating \"NO'.  I went to get my food, came back and guess what was on the table? The pitcher of coffee! SO WEIRD! But then again after that she never came back to offer refills of soda etc. Not going back to this dump."}
{"text":"Biggest variety of food in town and I always come with my kids and never once was bad. Good, I don't know about fresh, food."}
{"text":"This place cost $10 for dinner and they have the same beef steak as The Buffet. They don't have everything like the king crab legs and desserts but it pretty good for the price. Lots of Canadian French in the summer. Margarita taste pretty good. Get free comp when you gamble. Pasta is ok. I tasted it once with shrimp and never tasted it again. Soups are good. Salad bar is good too."}
{"text":"My husband and friend came early for a concert tonight and decided to eat in the buffet. My friend had eaten already and just wanted to sit with my husband and me but a very rude person who seats guests told her she couldn't sit unless she paid! Not only that she had another co-worker who claimed to be a supervisor come and shake her finger at my friend and told her she had to pay $12.95! My friend repeated told them she wasn't there to eat, just sit wit us before the show. After my husband and I returned to the table, my friend told me about it so I asked our waitress for the manager. The manager was very pleasant and condoned the others behavior, but my friend had just left in disgust! This was our first time here and probably the last. The manager spent considerable time outside talking with my friend and said she would have approved her staying. The food overall was not as fresh or good as other Station Casinos. Time was 7 pm."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here on Sundays after church, the only problem is the line! But overall is pretty good, not a lot of options but what they have is very delicious and worth the price specially their steak!"}
{"text":"The food is decent some - the Chinese food is it's weak link. Generals chicken is borderline uneatable, the salad bar is great. The line is a mess. The arrows for upper play cards is not clear the arrow doesn't exactly make it clear. The arrow points straight when it should indicate an immediate turn. I think fixing that would help."}
{"text":"Overall my experience was average. I came here for their \"brunch\" buffet, but because it took so long to actually get it most of the brunch items were already out away. Was a bit of a bummer. I had heard raves for this place and it ceased to wow me.   What little breakfast I did have (chicken and waffles, yum!) was delicious. I also added on the bottomless mimosas which is a must have if you come here for brunch as it is totally worth the extra! They of course had a very large variety of food to please everyone in your party. The only things that really stood out past my breakfast item was the chicken noodle soup and hazelnut gelato. Both were the saving grace of my visit.   I will say the service staff was attentive and filled our mimosas often so that was much appreciated. As far as buffets in Vegas go this one was average."}
{"text":"They have a variety of dishes for breakfast. From omelets to nachos.. it is all So good and fresh. They replenish the bar like clock work... I never had to wait for anything to be refilled.   The staff is friendly. A good buffet to go to anytime."}
{"text":"I've been to this buffett twice now (lunch and dinner) within the last couple of months and thought it was very good for the price. However, with the local discount I think I'd prefer the Carnival World buffett at the Rio which I think is very similar only with more to choose from. It was nearly two years ago since we went to the Rio so I could be wrong. I just remember the Rio had Lasanga which I thought was quite good for a buffett."}
{"text":"O M G....  So here's a HUUUUGE tip, get the playing card, you don't have to use it, it's free, no nothing with it, just get it, it gives you a great discount for the buffet forever!  So this place has this awesome weekend brunch that has champagne/mimosas for free!!!! :D Also, they AREN'T watered down! Yikes! It's a great deal except that the alcohol stops you from eating as much, so beware! Okay, the food is good and interesting. They have a little of everything from mexican, american, chinese, indian(the health food options), sushi, salad and dessert bars; also breakfast, cuz duh! I enjoyed almost everything I ate and just hate that my stomach won't fit EVERYTHING in like it used to, without clogging me up. ooops, tmi.   Just give it a shot. This will be a new monthly thing I do, for sure!"}
{"text":"January 7th 2017. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Had a party of 6 & with the \"Player's Card\" it came out to be $6.99 each. Only waited about five minutes for a table and the entire staff was enthusiastic considering it was only 8 in the morning.   The choices for Breakfast ranged from ham, scrambled eggs, waffles and pancakes to donuts, bagels and tacos. The food tasted fresh and was absolutely delicious. Nothing about the dishes were too salty or undercooked. I appreciated the variety this buffet had to offer. I prefer the Feast Buffet over the French Market Buffet in the Orleans."}
{"text":"Very bad service , the cashier are rude and stuff is rude . Don't want to give good service if you bring a complementary dinner.  If you go pay cash comp are not good."}
{"text":"Best value for buffet we've found.  Fairly good variety, although I wish there was more seafood.  Great variety on salad bar and in fruit.  Love the gelati."}
{"text":"Great quality food at an amazing price.  The reason why is because it's located inside of the Aliante Casino.  A casino catering to the local gambling degenerants of Las Vegas  ^_^"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. My family and I love it. Affordable and good food. Plenty of parking since is in the Green Valley Ranch hotel."}
{"text":"Affordable, nice staff, and not as crowded as buffets on the strip. Have had the dinner buffet twice and have yet to be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Stay far away from this buffet, I'm still in the dinning room as I write this review because it couldn't wait until I got home. I'm a local so when I say the food quality has gone down, I gave 10 years of comparisons of quality. First off, the sign out front that tells you lunch is $7.99, is NOT true, only if your a big gambler and have a higher level players card. You have to read the really really small print or you get charged $8.99 at a minimum. Now for the food, there isn't too much food to be had. They really wait for the last scrap to be removed from any pan before starting to cook. I waited 15 minutes for fried chicken, 3 people went in the kitchen to check on chicken and then just went hiding. Then I was told \"ok, we will START cooking chicken now\". Of course I'm upset so I asked for the manager, someone came to my table, I told them what's going on then they said, \"nice story and nice concern but I'm not the manager\". Then after another 5 minutes the manager comes to the table with a helper from the kitchen, the manager didn't say 1 word, not can I help you, what's wrong, NOTHING! The chef said, we are cooking chicken now. The chicken was finally cooked, the first piece I took was bloody and NOT fully cooked. The cream of broccoli soup was so thick and lumpy it was like stew but curdled. I told the chef about the soup as well but he didn't care and the garbage is still on the buffet, no surprise but it's full because nobody wants that crap. Unbelievable quality, honestly your better off going to a local hospital and eating the cafeteria food from there. Management is weak, not ONE word when she came to the table. I'm done with this place, better off going to Red Rock buffet, they have never let me down."}
{"text":"Was treated like crap by Viola, she would roll her eyes and question if we were even able to pay! Completely unacceptable. We called earlier and confirmed that they were serving brunch. I record all my calls (work related). When I played the audio and they said it was their casino operator and that its not their fault  I was misinformed. DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU WANT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"I remember when this used to be one of the best buffets in town.   Tonight the buffet bar was empty, food was of poor quality, salad bar was a joke, and the dessert bar only had about for choices on it that repeated on both sides. Our server was actually nice and kept our glasses full. We told him how disappointed we were and he apologized and went to tell the manager. The manager never came to talk to us.  We will not be eating here again. We are locals and will take our hunger elsewhere."}
{"text":"Well, we decided to go out for dinner. I should have known it wasn't going to be that great when they told us that it didn't matter if Our granddaughter has a feeding tube and doesn't eat that much - and their answer was \"we don't care how much she eats... it's the fact that she is in the restaurant so we will be charging you full price\". $10 for a buffet for a 4 year old that ate a half a piece of pizza, a quarter of a glass of water and three popcorn shrimp.  The shrimp was over cooked, the turkey was dry, the stroganoff was made with pot roast not steak, the noodles were gooey, there was no sour cream. The Asian food was meh, the spring rolls were stale, the salad bar was bare, the ham was slimy. The best part was the ice cream- just don't get a cone because they are stale too. All I can say is if you are thinking about eating here - don't.  ***UPDATE*** After eating here everyone in the family got sick - including the baby who only had a half a piece of pizza and some tomatoes and a few bites of shrimp. Due to her stomach surgery, she's not supposed to be able to throw up, however, she did for two days. We all ended up needing Imodium and Pepto Bismol. Be very wary."}
{"text":"Planning ur wedding is not easy specially if ur from a different state... A family friend recommended this place for our reception..  Jumped online and started my inquiry... Michelle who's in charge of the reservations was helpful.. She's kinda busy most times which I fully understand.. Email is actually a better and faster way to communicate with her which actually helps at least u can always go back with the previous convo..  On d day of the reception... Everything was smooth... Our server (wasn't able to get his name because of the chaos lol) was very attentive glasses was always filled...  Can't give a review for the food because I wasn't able to eat much... Lol Kudos to the employees..."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner last night because we had a 2 for 1 coupon. We were waiting in line for about 45 minutes. Our server was great, she kept our drinks full, and table clear.   The food was good, it was better than your average buffet, I really enjoyed the meat selection. The deserts were kind of lacking.   I would recommend coming here if you want a to have a variety of food and have coupon!"}
{"text":"Most of the food is decent. The scrambled eggs were delicious! The desserts are a bit bland and dry. Service is so so. The drink servers make very few rounds. About 30 minutes or longer for them to come around and ask if you need a refill. Worth the money. I've tried expensive buffets that are worse."}
{"text":"Staff are nice. I don't like much of the selection but my husband swears on the fried rice."}
{"text":"Great Value!  We went for the Sunday Brunch.  With players card you get $5 off, so the Sunday Brunch was only $15.  Good selection of breakfast foods with some lunch items as well (carved Turkey and Beef).  Asian food selections (Sushi, Orange Chicken, Chow Mein), Italian food as well.  I expected to face a long wait, however, we were seated in about 5 minutes.  This is certainly not the Rio Buffet or Bellagio....but for the price you can't beat it anywhere."}
{"text":"One of the best local Stations Casino buffet in the valley right side by side with Green Valley Ranch Casino! This place is kept clean & classy.  Feast Buffet at Red Rock has a modern feel to it! The food and quality is pretty decent...not your creme de la creme of buffets but definitely not your cheap down town casino buffet. The food comes fresh and tasty enough to enjoy!  Your usual various stations from Mexcan, Asian, American and Italian.  They have an amazing pork chop done with mushrooms and onions and a gravy mix similar to alfredo sauce.  Tender in texture and in chew, the cream compliments the savory meat in your mouth.  you will find an assortment of fulfillment. At a reasonable price, one can find deals every now and then.    Sign up for a local stations card at red rock and receive discounts like 2 for 1 and sometimes a certain percentage off buffet prices.  A few times last August my wife was able to get a buffet for 4 people for only $12.00....practically $3.00 per person....amazing! Check out my tip on this place for a secret suggestion that is not really a secret at all!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Feast Buffet at Red Rock. It is a great option for off the strip Buffet. I've been a handful of times or so in the past 2 or so years and I've seen the same consistency.   The prices are 1/3 of what they are on the strip yet the food is still tasty. Don't get me wrong, it's not Bacchanal quality, but it is still quite good! I believe both Saturday and Sundays brunch comes with bottomless mimosas. All told, comes to about $15 a person or so if you present a (free to obtain) Station Casino players card. When I have friends in town and I want to take them somewhere where we can get the Vegas Buffet vibe at a fraction of the cost of the strip casinos, we always go to Red Rock.   I'm relatively critical of food and I can say that they truly will have some options for every palette! Carving station, large salad area, gelato, large dessert area, sushi, Asian, American, Italian, pizza... you really can't go wrong here.   I definitely recommend stopping in! I know I'll be back in the future."}
{"text":"They need plate warmers for their buffet plates, the food turns cold by the time you start eating it because the plates are cold. Every casino buffet I've been to in Biloxi MS uses plate warmers. It's a simple fix Redrock..."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to get lunch for $7.99(with player's card).  Servers are nice and on top of refilling your drinks and clearing your plates, but then there are a few that aren't perfect.  Like I said, $8 for a good selection of food; Italian, Mexican, Sushi, American.    Bonus is the dessert area.  The ice cream is wonderful, but they need to cool down the bowls.. Ice creams melt before i can get back to my table.  They also need more chef/servers in the dessert area.  No one is usually available to get my cheesecake for me since they keep it in a glass cooler as a display.    Overall, I gave it 4 stars because of the price."}
{"text":"Meh. It's okay. I mean, it's only $9.99, so how can you complain. (I guess) I try and stick to the roast beef or turkey and then make my own salad.  But honestly, most of the other things that I've tried there have been marginal, at best.  Pad Thai tastes NOTHING at all like Pad Thai, egg rolls are completely pasty inside and have no flavor. The beef and broccoli is always terribly overcooked, rendering the broccoli pretty much inedible. In fact, their vegetables across the board are usually overcooked and utterly bland.  I do like the BBQ pork, the beef fajitas and the pork asada. And my boyfriend is easy to please because all he ever wants is hamburgers, pizza and spaghetti, which he claims they do quite well, but his standards are dismally low, so I take that with a grain of salt. (he's not much of a foodie, much to my dismay.) One thing I can say is that the service is always good....with dirty plates taken away quickly and drinks refilled fairly often.  I guess the bottom line is that I've paid a lot more on the strip for buffets that were certainly no better, so it's a good deal, all in all. (Kind of.)"}
{"text":"As far as buffets go, you can't beat $9.99 for a buffet that's loaded.  Has all types of cuisine: Chinese, Italian, American, BBQ, and Mexican.  I'm not saying that it's the best quality stuff here, but if you need good value for money this is the spot.  Especially if you're quite indecisive about what you want to eat."}
{"text":"It's 9.99 ok the weekdays and 14.99 on the weekends. But they make you sign up for an ID card for red rock hotel, which doesn't take too long.  They have a huge selection of dishes from Asian to seafood to American. Most of the dishes were pretty ok but if you're only paying 15 bucks, it's good enough.  My favorite part were the pie and gelato selections! They were all pretty good, especially the chocolate Creme pie!"}
{"text":"Visited this local spot a few times with family. I'll add each time was a comped meal which made the food taste even better! Service was good but the lines were long.   Didn't mind the lines after I was able to try their food. Their Asian Selection was huge! There was oxtail soup, mussels, clams and oysters...   Their other stations were good too but standard when compared to what you'll find in Vegas.   I will add that service was excellent. Servers came and refilled drinks quickly and took plates as well as utensils away as soon as they were available.   The dessert selection was good too!   If you find yourself in Red Rock or the Charleston Area in Vegas, you'll need to visit this place. Be sure to come hungry and prepared to sit for a while."}
{"text":"Sat lunch buffet review  For being one of the nicer, if not the nicest Station Casino, I was shocked to see just how small this buffet is. Now there are plenty of things to eat, and of what I ate, most everything was very good, but it is noticeably smaller than the Red Rock buffet, which I think is the best out of the Station Casinos.  When I go to buffets, I have a rule for myself. Well not so much a rule... more like a guideline. I eat only fish and veggies, no meat (besides a bowl of menudo, my favorite) or carbs. Even with this er, guideline, I was able to find lots of eat, but this is not Vegas' largest buffet by far.  They do have a Mongolian bbq station, which you won't find everywhere. However their salad bar and dessert section is smaller than average.  I did like how they have pesto sauce by itself in the pasta station. I love pesto so I put some on my grilled zucchini. Also they have a huge bowl of anitpasti there too; several kinds of olives, onion, pepperoncini, artichoke hearts, etc.  At the salad bar I like how they have pre-dressed salad options, my favorite being the spring mix with dried cranberries, walnuts and feta. On the other side of the salad bar was a very good and very rich hummus and israeli couscous. Yum.  Some of the misses: Bf said the turkey was dry. There was another meat at the carving station and he asked the carver guy what it was. He mumbles something then just cut him a piece. This was also dry. The pizza didn't look good. They only had cheese or pepperoni out, and looked like no sauce and a thick crust, which is the opposite of what I prefer, so luckily for my waistline, I skipped this.  Overall it was perfectly ok. But I do prefer Red Rock, more choices, larger dining room, and closer to my house."}
{"text":"Well I at least had to try one of these things once. Good thing it was lunch and I didn't waste more money. Living over here by the Galleria, there just isn't a lot of good selection for restaurants. I was REALLY craving mashed potatoes and some sort of home/american cooking. I thought surely they couldn't ruin mashed potatoes and I could find some basic meatloaf or something. Hurm, so much for thinking...  Cost - I'm not really cheap so the price wasn't that much but I was annoyed that it says everywhere $7.99 but when you get to the register they tell you it's $11.99 without one of their cards. WTF? Well charging me an extra $4 does really endear me to want to stay-and-play.  Wait - I really felt like I had to wait in line FAR too long for a Tuesday lunch. The place wasn't packed but it probably took 15 minutes to finally get through and \"sat.\"   Food - First off the selection wasn't that great. They had stations like \"International\" which amounted to quesadillas and \"Italian\" that was stocked with pizza and a few meatballs. I mean for crap's sake. How expensive are noodles anyhow? The \"American\" area had mashed potatoes but they were runny. I don't know how talented you have to be to mess up mashed potatoes. Again there wasn't much selection and the ham was a bit dry. Almost everything else I taste was just BORING BORING BORING. I know they are cooking for masses but seriously, you could try a LITTLE.   I can pretty much guarantee that unless I get drug here by someone else, I will never go back. It just helped remind me of why I HATE eating at casinos."}
{"text":"This is a review of their weekday lunch buffet.   The Skinny: so-so savory dishes with pretty bad dessert offerings,  the salad bar was highly picked over(2) service: pretty good for a buffet (4) value: inexpensive and dirt cheap if you factor in plentiful BOGO coupons but worth 1 hour wait in line? No. (2)  We have been trying to hit Feast buffet at least 4-5 times to take advantage of a BOGO promotion which was valid between Monday through Thursday. Each time we turned around because the lines were ridiculously long.   Finally we go online and see that hey! Feast is no longer continously open like it used to be.  They shut down the lines between breakfast/lunch/dinner; 15 minutes between breakfast and lunch and 1 hour between between lunch and dinner. They are pretty serious about it too. We exited the buffet at 3pm and the line was completely shut down. No one was in line.  All this explains why when we'd get there at like 4pm, there would be a massive line of people waiting for the buffet to open. Insane.   In addition, nearly everyone in line had either a complimentary buffet coupon or a BOGO coupon. I guess we're not the only ones with the same idea.   Given that the buffet is comped to hell,  the line gets pretty long. We got in line at 1pm and didn't get seated until 2pm on a Thursday afternoon. One can only imagine what it is like on weekends.   Once we get in,  the hubs hit the buffet right away (he didn't have anything to eat all day) while I waited for the server to order drinks. Our server was pretty on the ball and got to our table pretty quick. She cleared our plates and refilled our drinks promptly. FYI -  drinks included Pepsi products, juices (pretty generic tasting but all the flavors that one can mix alcohol with including grapefruit and cranberry),  coffee and tea.   In terms of lunch time buffet, the offerings were okay.  The salad bar was really picked over which was a huge disappointment. They had bowls of plain greens (spring mix,  romaine, iceberg),  standard toppings (carrots,  beets, chickpeas,  croutons,  cucumbers,  etc... No eggs though),  a few sad bowls of marinated salads and cold pasta that were half/nearly empty. They did not have charcuterie or any cold cuts. It looked like they did have some Mediterranean cold dishes like hummus but that was literally meant scrapping the the bottom of the dish. Had half the salad buffet just sitting empty (piles of ice) with no refills during the hour we were there. Fruit consisted of fresh melon, pineapple, and  watermelon. Plus some canned peaches and pears.   They did have some soups. The hubs tried the tomato bisque which was the best thing at the buffet in his opinion. He also said the tomato bisque I make at home tastes better.   Lean protein wise, they offered roasted turkey (a bit dry and a little salty), chicken (okay,  Costco chicken tasted better),  sausage (salty) and pork loin (okay). The chimichurri was solid and made up for the dryness of the meat. They also had a bowl of barbecued chicken legs which were nothing special. The only real beef (I do not count ground beef) was a some tri-tip swimming in a grayish brown soupy mess with some sparse mushrooms in there. It looked scary enough that I did not partake.   Sides wise,  they had your standard creamed spinach,  corn, greens,  mac and cheese, potatoes, and a few types of beans.   In terms of ethnic food,  they had Asian, Italian and international stations.   The Asian station looked pretty awful. The steamed charsiu bao were piled on top of each other in one soggy mess. Their vegetables,  chow mein,  sweet and sour pork,  spring rolls made Panda Express look like Michelin star cuisine. Yeah,  they also had sushi but it looked pretty funky and prepared in massive platters. That = disaster in the making.   Tried their sopes in the Mexican station which were impossible to eat given how hard they were. Skipped the generic taco kit offerings which were potential Taco bell in quality.   The stromboli from the Italian station and it was too salty and doughy.  Ruined my appetite to try anything else.   Dessert was a huge miss for me. Nothing looked particularly appetizing especially the ice cream/gelati. Give me store bought Talenti any day over what they had there. I tried one slice of lemon meringue pie which I took one bite of before I stopped. It tasted way too sweet and artificial. After that I stuck with fruit.   Although the service was good,  you can't overlook the fact that the food ain't that great. The variety is there but the quality certainly isn't. Yeah,  it's cheap but time is worth a lot too. Definitely not worth a one hour wait. (2 starred review)"}
{"text":"Well you get what you pay for the old saying goes. Rule number 1 all way look at the food BEFORE you go and pay for it you have the opportunity to leave. Once you paid well...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this buffet last night. The food was great and I was really happy with all of the vegetarian options. But we had one major issue with this buffet. Online, it says that preferred members get to eat dinner for $11.99 and when we went to pay they told us it was $16.99 for preferred cards. My boyfriend brought up his phone because this was the reason we chose to go to this buffet. And even though we proved to the cashier that it does indeed say $11.99 for preferred cards on the site, she didn't give us the price we came for or grabbed a manager to view the site. She didn't care at all, she just said that the website is wrong. We didn't argue with her or anything, we paid for it because we were hungry."}
{"text":"This food has no flavor. I've eaten better tasting food in the field at 29 palms. Even though it was cheap don't waste your money and time, spend a few more dollars and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Ah! A buffet. Love 'em or leave 'em, I've always said. Well, actually I have never said that until now.   I have eaten breakfast here and also supper. Both were good-not spectacular, mind you, but good. The waitstaff and servers are excellent. I had carved beef. Others have said that it was great. They were right. Then, I had grilled sausage with onions and bell peppers. It also was pretty good. I would have grilled the peppers a little more but I happily ate them.  Dessert was ok but I have always been disappointed by buffet desserts; and that includes the Bellagio and The M, The Rio---all of them. They look great but only taste ok. Ok means so-so and don't waste your time with them.  All-in-all, I liked the experience and will come back. Of course, that's because that's how I am. Not changing either. Just give me some wonderful CHERRY pie and I will fade away in happy contentment."}
{"text":"We came for the Prime Rib and Shrimp buffet. We should have taken the hint when a guy walking out said he was going to McDonalds. We thought he was making a joke. We were there at 7pm, not right before closing, and all the food was old. The prime was rare, but so tough that you couldn't even cut it with a knife. It was very chewy. The only shrimp I could find was some small, deep fried, and some peel and eat. They were both mediocre. The mashed potatoes were good. Stuffing was dried out. The chicken taco meat was old and dried out. Mac and cheese was dried out and crunchy. I could keep going, but you get the point. We tried telling the manager, and he was making excuses and very dismissive. So we paid $80 for 4 sodas and mashed potatoes...."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent the Feast Buffet at Red Rock Casino.  The prices are reasonable especially if you carry their gaming card.  I would have given 5 stars but for some reason they always serve the same meats.  Turkey, Smoked Sausage, Prime Rib, Fried Chicken ( which by the way is nasty, overcooked always, and always tastes sour)  I mentioned it to management nothing done about it and I also said something to one of the cooks behind counter and his smart as replies it's the oil we fry it in. so I recommended they might want to change the oil, which was not done.   I really wish the served Ham more often though.  Be prepared sometimes for long lines and also be prepared of people going against the flow and then they look at you like you are the idiot. Even with these few flaws we will continue to keep going back because for the price you just can't beat it."}
{"text":"This is the worst Feast Buffet out of all the Station Casinos. We came for lunch and there was a long line outside. Waited for at least 45 mins. The cashier was really slow, and the hostesses even slower. When we finally were seated, there were empty tables everywhere! Clean tables with settings on them, all ready to go. What the hell was the holdup?  The buffet itself is very small. Not many selections. You can go thru it once and pretty much get everything you wanted. On my second trip back I didn't see anything else I wanted to try that I didn't get the first round.  Upside, is they do have the chile verde here, like at the other Feasts, and it's also very good. Roast beef was tender. Menudo was good like the other Feasts (not too salty or oily, hominy tender, tripe also tender). But I would not come back here bc of lack of choices and long wait times.  Our waiter was very good and efficient. But I felt bad for him that many tables didn't leave him any tip. There was a table of 6 by us and they didn't even leave a dollar per person, nothing."}
{"text":"Hey not bad for $8.99 lunch. I like this Feast Buffet the best out of all the Station Casinos' buffets I have tried so far. They have a pretty solid Mexican station. And I don't mean the yellow cheese sauce and ground beef. Skip those and head on over to the chile verde and carnitas. Bf had an ingenious idea to get some of the chiliquiles and top them with the chile verde. Also lots of toppings to add on, incl real guacamole, not some thinned out watery green sauce, pickled carrots/onions.  Carving station had ham, turkey, and roast beef. All very good, and none of it dry.  Lots more to be eaten too!  Make sure to get your Station Casino boarding pass for a small discount!"}
{"text":"Why didn't we try out this place sooner?! $8.99pp for a weekday lunch is a steal! Many of the other Station Casinos are the same price for lunch, but the quality, service, and decor are far better here than any of the others. Good thing it's close to our house; this is our new spot!  The line was pretty short at 11:30 but still moved pretty slow. However once we got past the cashiers we were seated promptly.  Lots of choices here! Let's start from the very left:  Sushi This buffet is the only Station Casino that serves sushi for lunch (however I haven't been to Green Valley yet so don't know about that one). These are basic maki rolls, but were pretty well done. Philly roll, spicy tuna, CA roll, shrimp tempura, veggie, inside out CA w masago. Everything was decent except the shrimp tempura which was soggy for obvious reasons. There was also a shrimp ceviche dish next to the sushi which was made of bay shrimp (no veins in them, nor were they overcooked or powdery), cucumber, avocado, tomato. I went back for thirds on this.  Mexican All the Feast buffets have Mexican food and this one was no exception. My faves are the menudo (not too oily or salty) and chile verde. There's also sopes, enchiladas, make-your-own-fake-tacos, and a good condiment bar with thick guacomole, crema, and all the other toppings you'd need. Also they have street corn!  Chinese Your basic Chinese-American fare here, but my fave was the mini bbq pork buns (cha shu bao) which were not overly sweet like they usually are in buffets. Other dishes were egg rolls, chinese broccoli w oyster sauce, tom yum soup (very good with actual shrimp in there), hot and sour soup, egg drop soup. And next to the Chinese food is the Chinese condiments, including super hot Chinese mustard! Yay! I didn't care for the curry chicken in this section. I didn't taste any curry flavor at all. Though the meat was juicy and well cooked.  BBQ/American While these sections were separate from each other, I didn't eat much from here since I am staying away from red meat and carbs, but bf had lots from here and most of it was pretty good. Carving station had ham, turkey, and two kinds of sausages. Also had mashed potatoes, grilled talapia, grilled veggies, bbq chicken, etc.  Italian Lots of pizza, garlic bread and pasta here. Again I didn't try any but looked really good. I did have some of the antipasto at the right end of this section. Salami, olives, etc. Yum!  Salad bar Don't miss out on this. It's not just your regular old salad bar. They had this great frisse salad with strawberry and candied walnuts (I got seconds). Pickled beets which I had with bleu cheese, farro salad, tuna salad, egg salad, caprese salad, so many more I'm sure I'm forgetting, and of course the make your own salad part. Also plenty of cut fruit; cantaloupe, honeydew, etc, not just the canned peaches and pears in heavy syrup.  Dessert We just shared a tiny soft serve cone, but if you want pies, they got them here! Pumpkin, lemon meringue, cheesecake, etc. Plus donut holes, brownies, bread pudding, AND regular scooped ice cream in addition to the soft serve. Only thing missing was cream puffs and eclairs.  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Came here and enjoyed a quick meal before catching the \"upset weekend\" UFC196.  The food was good and the service was great. Shot out to our server Victor who kept clearing out plates and topping of our drinks.   The prime rib and peel shrimp were on point.  This place is comparable to the Red Rock Buffet but at a discounted price. The stations have a great selection to choose from.  The dining area is spacious and clean and the decor is nicely done.  I would recommend this to anyone if in the area.  The hotel/casino is a bit of a distance from the strip but well worth the visit.  What made this place even more appealing was the two for one promotion the my were running for new players card members.  I will be back for sure.  Thanks Feast Buffet and Santa Fe for keeping my tummy full and wallet full!"}
{"text":"After more bad experience than good, I don't plan on ever going back. The only reason I give two stars is for convenience. Here are two of our worst experiences.   We went one Saturday for the mimosa brunch. After a few mimosa's, our server attempted to 'cut us off!' We had our kids with us & would NEVER get drunk in front of them, we only had 2-3 very week mimosa's per person (in the span of an hour), & if you knew us-we aren't heavy drinkers-at all! It was very insulting. She took it back after we confronted her asking which of us she thought was drunk and merited being 'cut off'? She brought us another, which we left untouched on the table. It should probably be noted that this particular server could not understand the thick accent of one in our party & became very impatient with my friend. (Before the mimosa incident).   We tried Thanksgiving also! Big, big, big mistake! Only if you have a 'high' players card and can bypass the line & you like their mediocre food. Before we started, they said it was a 2-2/12 hour wait. No problem. We knew being Thanksgiving, there would be a wait. We arrived at 10:45 for this reason! The line actually moved pretty good for the first two hours....then it basically stopped!!! The lunch hour hit & all the 'high' players cards started coming in and getting priority! After waiting 2 hours, that added another 2 & 1/2 hour wait! 4 & 1/2 hour wait!!! We were starving. At this point, there was no other place for us to go! Wait time would still be 1-2 hours unless we went to McD's. My dad was here from out of state & it was what he wanted so we stuck it out. I would not have! The food is never that great! I thought thanksgiving would be better. Turkey & a bunch of casseroles!!! Ok...so the turkey was only breast, which you had to wait in another line to get it because they only had one turkey carving station on THANKSGIVING! The sweet potatoes were not cooked (hard as red rock) with a few marshmallows thrown on top & there were really no other traditional casseroles. I was not impressed with the dessert. The pies were made somewhere else & they ran out of whip cream by 5pm. Let's just say.....I'm thankful for the knowledge to never come back!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great location. Plenty of helpful staff.great vibes. Clean atmosphere. Not smokey at all. short expedited service in the lines. All the food was piping hot and delicious. I didnt like the lo mein noodles, per se. But that's a personal taste.   The desserts are amazing.  The salad bar was super fresh. The staff was always there to answer a question and deliver great service. The locals were right. This place is hard to beat. Price, plates, and perfect location for a knockout buffet experience."}
{"text":"Only other Feast I've tried as of yet is the one at Sunset Station, this one is virtually identical but has more meat options at breakfast for some reason (despite being the same price). Coffee was also stronger and tastier here.   Only downside to this location? Be prepared for a bare minimum 5 minute wait in line at any given time, 10-15 minutes at busier times like dinner and on weekends, and more like 30 minutes if you try to get in on the free Veterans Day buffet ;p"}
{"text":"If you play at all at the Station Casinos you can frequently get these for free or nearly free, and at like 7 bucks the breakfast buffet is still really cheap even if you pay full price ... for some reason this particular buffet seems to have less meat options than the same-price one over on Boulder Highway though, but otherwise it's pretty good.   It's also definitely less crowded, usually no to almost no wait on any given weekday morning, vs usually at least a 5 minute line on any random weekday over at Boulder."}
{"text":"Tried out this buffet after our LV local friend recommended this place and it did not disappoint.   Before I go on any further with this review, I would like to preface that I had a bad experience with one of the hyped-up on-the-strip buffets and I have always found that buffets that locals usually recommend are usually consistent with good service with a relaxed atmosphere. I also took off a star because with the hype of a lot of Vegas buffets,  Feast's food is more humble and some people can be turned off with that. If you are expecting food with names that are made up by some Francophile, then this is not your place to eat.  Atmosphere and decor of Feast is simple Mediterranean. It is also very clean. The staff was very efficient in seating me and my family. Our waitress was very attentive to us and made sure that drinks were refilled and plates were put away, even to the point that one of my sauce cups were thrown away, even though I wasn't done! It was my fault, though, as I should have not put it in the vicinity of our used plates.   Food, like I said, is not fancy, but humble. It really hits the spot and has a good variety of diversity. Some of the food was rather bland, but it's okay. I think the majority of guests there prefer it that way and you can spice it up a bit with condiments.   There is one specific thing they don't have, which can turn off some parents, which are booster seats. My toddler son usually prefers booster seats and not high chairs. However, they do have high chairs. It's not a huge compromise, but it may be worth noting.   Last, but not least, the prices are really fair! With a player's card, our total came out to less than $20/person and that was for dinner! Our two-year-old got in for free.   Overall a great place to eat! Our local friend steered us to the right direction and my family and I walked out of there happy!"}
{"text":"Good value for $10 with a players card. Food is decent and I usually go between this one and Firelight Buffet which is down the street at Sams Town. Check them both out."}
{"text":"Definitely a very good buffet for the money. A wide variety of tasty food including LOTS of crab legs. We were very satisfied by the varied selection of hot foods and desserts.   Be prepared for a significant wait to be seated during meal times. This buffet is popular. Perhaps go a bit earlier."}
{"text":"For 8.99 with a players card you can't beat that. The food is a pretty good selection, but the cashier is always terrible! The older lady who's normally there for dinner time is a bitch. Who charges full price for a 2 year old?? My daughter doesn't even eat a full plate. & she's just rude all the time."}
{"text":"Aww hell naw! Stay away,, keep ur money. The simple foods that I couldnt imagine a way for someone to mess up are all n here. Something as simple as a dinner roll, pretty much tastes like cardboard,, at least 2 me. I want my $8.99 back!"}
{"text":"my husband and I just had dinner here tonight. it's Tuesday we got there a little after 6, the line was long and slow. we literally waited in line for an hour. my Dad goes to boulder station everyday to swipe our cards. he racks up points on all our cards ( my mom,my sister,my husband,myself and his own card). because of this my husband and I can pay for dinner with our points and it's free, we just leave the tip. that part is awesome and I feel I can't complain too much. but I definitely would not wait an hour in line on a Tuesday to pay for this buffet with my own money. I would rather pay for bellagio buffet or just a restaurant I actually like, love. it's not awful, I've never gotten sick from it. there's a decent salad bar ( I'm a salad lover, I almost never eat meat at buffets, my husband is a big meat eater though), the dressings are decent, they have blue cheese crumbles and beets which I love. the macaroni and cheese looks straight up gross.their creamed spinach is ok and they have little fried popcorn shrimp which are ok. I had a couple slices of the white pizza. it had just been put out so it was not that bad. it's cheap you can tell, but it's edible. you are going to get what you pay for (or don't pay for in my case) here. with a players card (boarding pass they call it) Dinner tonight is only 9.99, for us it was 5 bucks cuz we paid with our points and just left a tip. so you can't expect some like mind blowing gourmet dishes. for a practically free dinner date with my husband it's  alright. minus the wait though, f that. had I know ahead of time we would have to stand in line for an hour we would have stayed home a hundred percent. I had a good Sunday brunch here a while ago though, I will say that. and I did pay cash for that. it comes with mimosas and it's breakfast food, like eggs Benedict and cheese blitzes and bacon and other yummy things. I was definitely more satisfied with that brunch than this dinner that's for sure. but it's food, I got fed at no cost to me so I gotta be grateful for that.  there is nothing at this buffet that I come specifically for except for a cheap dinner out of the house, if not for my dad and the points,I would not come here, buts it's not the worst."}
{"text":"After I ate at this buffet last Sunday I went home and was severely sick. I am almost certain it was the ribs I ate at the buffet. Needless to say, I will not be back to this buffet again."}
{"text":"I love me some Feast Buffet.  For the money, you can't really beat it.  For those complaining about the quality, please keep in mind that you are eating a $12 buffet dinner.  This isn't Wynn or Bacchanal - but for $12 it's pretty darn good.  Lines at Feast can be hit or miss, so don't let that deter you.  The place is huge on the inside and they usually crank through the line pretty quickly.  I found the food selection to be above average.  There were some items missing, especially in the Asian section.  This Feast has almost all of the Asian section relegated to stir fry and Mongolian BBQ.  Very few pre-cooked items other than ribs and greasy spring rolls.  The one item you must try is the carved turkey.  I got the last nub of turkey before they replaced it with a new one and it was still tender and moist.  Incredible that it was so delicious, and you must try it.  The stuffing was decent and so were the mashed potatoes, but the turkey really stood on its own.  I have yet to try the pizza at any Feast buffet, as it always looks rubbery and greasy.  The meatballs are pretty good, although not necessarily the 'freshest' tasting.  Marinara sauce is flavorful enough.  And dessert.  The cheesecake is among the best I have had.  Ever.  It looks like it's going to be dense and sticky, but it's really light and whipped.  it truly is amazing.  The mini-eclairs are good although they lose a little from being cold.  The ice cream / gelato selection is huge with some fun flavors (the mint chocolate chip tastes like a shamrock shake).  All in all, this is a great value.  The food is pretty good quality for a buffet, and it's even better quality for the price.  As with any buffet, some items are going to be awesome and some are going to miss the mark.  At this price, just keep going back and trying more stuff."}
{"text":"My bf and I want to try all the buffets in Vegas for when guest visit so we tried this one tonight. It wasn't that busy thankfully since it was a Sunday night. The food was just average, not bad but not fantastic. The pizza was less then impressive, the pasta was good, Asian food was decent, desserts were okay, some better then others. Overall we decided we would go back if we got coupons with our players card. Otherwise we will eat else where."}
{"text":"Went in last night for the first time. We got a bogo deal in the mail so figured for $11 it was worth a try. We tipped on my credit card before service since I forgot cash. We were seated by a nice hostess right away. We left and got our first plate of food and sat down. Over 10 mins go by and no one came by to take our drink orders. Numerous servers passed us since we were by where the drinks come out at. After 10 minutes I found another hostess and asked her how we get drinks since it's been over 10 minutes. She rudely said \"they will bring them to your table\" and ran off. Didn't care at all about customer service. After 15 mins of sitting there, finished our plate of food we finally got our sodas ordered. She was okay with bringing them out after. This will be the last time I tip first. The food was subpar. Pretty much what we expected from a station casino. I have been to a few of their buffets and it's never been even good. They had a few items like mashed potatoes, potato salad and ice cream that were actually good. But I assume 2 of those come premade. We might return for more bogo deals since we left full on $11 plus tip which you can't really do through a drive through. But if we want a buffet we will hit the casino on the far south side of town.."}
{"text":"Great Casino with a horrible buffet! It's mediocre at best. Ive been twice and it was bad both times. Please GVR you have a nice casino in a rich neighborhood step your food game up. Down the street at the M the buffet is putting you to shame."}
{"text":"The lines for non-hotel-guest and non-players-club we're super long, almost an hour!  That said, the food was definitely better than many buffets we've eaten at.  One of the employees, Rosie, was SUPER helpful!  All in all, we had a great experience there! :)"}
{"text":"It's right in the name, Feast Buffet! Tons upon tons of options for your plate. We found out about this buffet through a friend. And decided we had to go check it. It's right inside of the gorgeous Red Rock Casino. We saved a few bucks by signing up for the rewards program and headed inside. While a server takes your order for drinks. It's up to you to decide how full your plate will be. We got there during breakfast time. I had already been piling foods like Country fried steak. Then bacon, which I was sad to see it was thin brittle pieces. I believe the fat was cut off and it is made to be crunchy. Which isn't for me at all. Eggs were next, unfortunately for me I scooped watery and soggy eggs onto my plate. My guess is I grabbed too close to the bottom of the dish. But that was ok, I changed it for Eggs Benedict , and it was the best. Various other breakfast foods were added and we ate that. Then something super lucky happened. When we inside still eating, they switched over to lunch! Now we were getting two meals for one. I could have Sushi, pizza, grilled food items and more. So I did, the only bad thing I grabbed was grilled eggplant. It needed to be grilled in thin slices not a whole half. It was icky, wet, and tasted bitter. Everything else (especially dessert) was amazing."}
{"text":"We came as a group of 17 and came here as part of our family vacation. Each family paid for their own. We came when they opened for dinner at 4, so there weren't many seats filled. We wanted to sit near each other because we barely see each other, but there was a 15% gratuity fee if we wanted to sit even NEAR each other. I understand if we all paid in one and wanted to push some tables together, then a gratuity fee is somewhat understandable. But as we were entering, the hosts were talking on the radio about our family and ended up separating us in different parts of the restaurant! They could've just simply put us in the same area.   The highlight of the night was our waiter, John. He makes sure we have enough napkins and everything is taken care of. He is pretty much the only reason why we were to enjoy our dinner.   In short. Way to be discreet about your absurd \"policy\" of not seating family close to each other. But great job John for making my family's night."}
{"text":"Made to order al pastor tacos? Cool! Not so cool? Waiting for someone to make said tacos, even though you've been standing there waiting for more than 5 mins.  That was my experience. First round there was a guy already there dishing out the tacos. I got two and they were good! Went back for another round. This time no guy standing at the cook top. But there's a guy not two feet away chopping a bunch of al pastor.  CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP  *looks me in the eye, then...  CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP  I kid you not. He looked me in the eye at least three more times and went right back to chopping. Then finally he says, you need something?  OMG are you serious? I should have just ordered one taco after all that to piss him off, but they were good, so I asked for two. Then a lucky guy after me, doesn't have to wait and he gets three. You're welcome dude.  Bottom line, the Mexican fare here is pretty decent. They also have the bomb chile verde and carnitas that they have at the other Feasts, and the chunky real guacamole and other toppings. Menudo was good, not too salty. But I probably won't come back here unless I really want some al pastor. That guy really pissed me off."}
{"text":"My Hubby and I were very happy with the buffet here it is reasonably priced and the food is actually pretty good. Like all buffets you have a few dishes that aren't up to par but they were not the norm. I was pleasantly surprised usually if you find a decent priced buffet the quality suffers but that is not the case here. They have several types of cuisine including Chinese Italian and sushi my only real disappointment was the desserts non of which were very good. And like with most buffets getting refills was a little hard but not as bad as some."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this buffet. We went on a Wednesday during lunch time. The wait to be seated was actually quite long. This is not our first experience with a station buffet... but our first at Green Valley. Honestly the Sunset Station, which is near by, was a far better buffet for many reasons. Reason one... the Sunset is a little cheaper than Green Valley. Green Valley's food isn't any better than Sunset. Actually enjoyed Sunset better and it was cheaper. Reason two... our waitress at Green Valley was not very helpful and seemed more irritated when we asked questions about our drink order. At Sunset the staff was very friendly and helpful. Reason three... they didn't seem to care for big party's of six with kids. They seemed to grouped all the party's with kids in the far back corner of the restaurant. Sunset station is very kid friendly. Don't want to sound terrible but they seemed to cater more for older adults... which brings me to... Reason number four... the other restaurant goers (mostly older adults) seemed rude and put off that there were kids in the restaurant. Sunset seemed to be more family oriented and very kid friendly. All in all... I probably won't revisit Green Valley. Next time I will head over to Sunset."}
{"text":"Eh, it's $8 for lunch - but for that price, you're not seeing the shrimp and crab, obviously.  The only seafood was a white fish of some sort, baked or fried.  But honestly, for $8, there's a ton of options including a plethora of desserts.  I enjoyed some big hunk of carved beef, plus turkey breast and some other things I can't remember right now.  I was happy that there were plenty of proteinlicious offerings.  Just wish I had some shrimp, too. ;)"}
{"text":"Riding home now so full I am almost in pain.   Went with my family and they enjoyed it.   I  started with soup and a salad.  Been a long time since I have had clam chowder that taste right.   It was delicious and had a lot of clams.  Next was the salad which I was able to enjoy for once since I  didn't have to worry about getting my money's worth.   The vegetables were very fresh and I liked the way they cut the carrots in  small pieces   the blue cheese dressing tasted nothing like it should. The carrot salad was a bit off.  Time for main course and I was impressed with the selection.   Asian,  Mexican, American, Italian, wow.   The calzone was almost on the mark but missed it by omitting the Italian Meats and substituting with chicken,  blah.  The creamy spinach was very good.   Thumbs up for having Brussel sprouts but they didn't taste right .  Tasted a bite of my husband's rib and the meat was a bit old tasting.  The dessers were standard fare.  why 4 stars?  My son loved it.   The variety was super.   The service excellent. But the price cinched it.  $35.00 for 3 people for a dinner buffet that did have some excellent choices nowadays is amazing.   Oh yeah we took the advice given by others and got a boarding pass card.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Feast buffet Palace Station casino is a great place to eat for the price. The food was good and nothing was unpleasant. The waiter was friendly. The line before entering was long, high, maybe 45 minute wait for lunch.  As many others have mentioned, you need a Boarding Pass to get the buffet discount. Getting the pass is free, and simple to do. I just handed the agent my ID and she took care of the rest.   Each Boarding Pass will allow you to purchase 2 adult buffets. So if you have a party of 8 adults, four people will need to sign up for the card. Children eat at the discounted rate without needing the cards but I don't know what the cut-ff age is.   Soda is included in the price of the meal. You can upgrade and add beer or wine, I think for an extra $2 (not certain on this - I saw a sign that said '$2' but I didn't read the fine print)  The pasta station had good food, but I didn't like having to shout my order through a plexiglass window. The ingredients offered aren't even listed anywhere so how are you supposed to know what's available? I ordered pasta with mushrooms, spinach and clams in Alfredo sauce.   Another good entree item was the Hawaiian BBQ chicken.   Dining here will cost you less than dining at McDonald's or Taco Bell. I recommend it for larger groups and families. I even have a picky eater in my family and she ate until she was full."}
{"text":"Terrible service, which is a shame because we found the service throughout the casino to be great. In here for about 45 minutes and saw our server twice. Food was average. Nothing special. Won't be making the trek back especially since it's so far from the strip. Free parking though, so that's a bonus."}
{"text":"The food at Red Rock's Feast Buffet will not sweep you off your feet but it does satisfy your appetite. The food selection is decent but the sushi bar was a little bit of a let down. The prime rib was decent.  The price is quite a bargain with a player's card. As, I am writing this review, I can not think of anything memorable from this dining experience. I know I did not have a bad experience. So, I should just leave it as that."}
{"text":"I'm in vegas 1 week so my friend took me to this place was really good and decent clean place $10 plus tip for my servers was good thanks :)"}
{"text":"Well i have been coming here since this placed opened and every time I've dinned here it has been great! But this time was awful! The chicken tasted like rotten fish, the ham was hard and dry, the mac n cheese was clumpy and powdery. The service wasn't great either, the guy who cuts the meat at the station was texting on his phone! How professional? Honestly the only reason i gave this place 2 stars because of their salad bar and gelato, that was actually not bad. This place used to be great but their quality is definitely going downhill. Its a shame too because i really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and breakfast the next day . For Lunch the food was flavorless and had nothing special about it . For breakfast my omelette was falling apart and bacon was burnt . Don't come here"}
{"text":"I was bet happy with my visit to Feast buffet. They had about 12 vegan selections along with a bunch of other healthy options like a full salad bar and fruit bar."}
{"text":"Best of the Station Casino buffets, but still not the best. Their food is usually a hit or miss for me and I'll either leave satisfied or unimpressed. I recommend going with a group of 4 or less people, otherwise you may be waiting quite a while for them to \"find\" you a table. We were here last week with a party of 5 adults and 2 kids and they made us wait in line like an additional 10 min to \"find\" a table big enough for 7 people. Meanwhile, people behind us with smaller parties of 2 or 4 were being let in first. When we were finally seated in the back, we realized the entire back area was full of clean, empty tables! All they had to do was push 2 of them together...why did it take so long?!  The best thing about this buffet is that they have sushi! Well, mainly California, tuna and salmon rolls so nothing exotic but still! Sushi at a $8 lunch buffet! I usually hit the sushi first, followed by selections from the rest of the Asian section based on what looks good. The Asian section is pretty hit or miss too. Next, I always hit up the American section in the middle to grab items like fried chicken, sausage, mac & cheese, etc. Then I grab dessert. I never really eat off the Mexican or Italian sections because they're not that great...and the carving station looks better than it tastes because the turkey and roast beef they're carving is usually pretty bone dry. The only time I'd recommend it is when they're carving pork shoulder because that is usually marbled with fat, moist and delicious!  All in all, not a bad buffet, but not the best. But for the price you really can't beat it! It's about 8 bucks for lunch and like 12 for dinner if you have a boarding pass card (you can get 2 discounts per cardmember). And if you gamble and get coupons, it's even cheaper!"}
{"text":"I used to come to this buffet a lot more, but it has gone downhill the last couple years. In fact lunch and dinner is so hit or miss that I now only come here for breakfast. My favorite thing about breakfast here is the cook to order omelette station, although sometimes the line does get a little long. The cooks always make the delicious eggs/omelettes here. There are limited options for breakfast because not all the stations are open...but how much can you really eat in the morning?   Lunch and dinner get a little more crowded here and if you come during peak meal times then for sure expect to wait in line unless you possess a President or Chairman boarding pass card to be able to cut the line. Regardless how much you gamble though, be sure to grab a boarding pass card because you'll get a $2-3 discount on your meal!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for my first buffet experience in Vegas and it was great. Plenty of options and the staff is very attentive. The quality of the food was typical for a Buffett but the salad bar was fantastic, and they have a taco bar, and who doesn't love a taco bar."}
{"text":"The buffet here is one of the better buffets. Fresh food and a fair selection. Usually on Easter they have free mimosas and on other Holidays they have a great special menu.  This buffet is a favorite among locals"}
{"text":"Never in my life have I had to wait in line as long as this buffet..... Waited over 30 minutes and the line of at least 75 people did not move..... I looked in dining area and there was more than 15 tables open..... RIDICULOUS!!!! Needless to say we left and will never be returning. This was 2pm in the afternoon. This should never happen!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on Sunday, so it was pretty busy. I had to wait in line for close to 45 minutes before being able to pay. Then, I had to wait another 20 minutes to be seated. It was a long wait. I understand that they're busy, but this was just a bit too much. When we were finally seated, the waiter took a long time to come and take our orders. It was rather annoying, but I understand that there were a lot of people eating that day. The food, however, was amazing! There were a lot of options and it all tasted fresh. The only real problem I had was with the waiting time."}
{"text":"Bad experience. To start, I think it's important to point out that, on several occasions, I've watched guests putting their finger inside of their pants and up into their behind. Then, they go and handle food. That's disgusting. But, that's what you get with buffets,  I guess.   Ok, wow, I hate writing bad reviews but problem after problem...I can't stand when people can't accept fault for a mistake.   President card status is supposed to get line priority.   Not today. Two kids that aren't even old enough to gamble were taken in first. No big deal. I'm just here to eat. That's just to pay.  Then comes the next line, to wait to sit. Two couples again that aren't in the priority line, are taken first. Ok, no big deal. I'm just here to eat.   So, the host is trying to seat me. I know that there's only a small pocket that gets phone service. There were seats available. Since I got ignored twice before even seating, I asked if I could sit in that section. \"No,\" the host responded. \"There aren't any servers to work there.\" Ok, no problem. I'm just here to eat.  Usually, I wait to order my drinks but I'm already having a bad experience and ran to the line to get food. I came back just as another guest was sitting so the server took both of our orders.   \"Can I get 2 tiger woods?\" (BTW, that's my creation. Raspberry iced tea and lemonade.)  Servers have gotten to know this concoction which I'm happy to see and he shook his head and proceeded to take the other guest that was just sitting. That guest ordered a coffee with cream and a coke. Strange but ok...  Server comes back with only one drink for me and all drinks for other guest. Oh well. I can order another, I'm just here to eat.   After returning from getting my second plate, what do you know? A couple is sitting in the section I requested. No biggie. I'm just here to eat.   Then, I realize...the food is dried garbage. Why am I just here to eat again?"}
{"text":"Not impressed...  I don't know how to say this any other way but if you are a white male, you should probably avoid this place. On two different occasions, one in the players club line and one in the buffet line. Today was a pull tab day so I went to the players club to open mine and to inquire about the buffet my host mentioned I would have. I tried calling Bryan yesterday to inquire about it but he never returned my call. The line at the players club was long and I could see there were several people in the Presidents or chairman line that weren't supposed to be there. But, it was really obvious when a white kid got to the front and wouldn't leave. I'm pretty sure he knew it wasn't but the lady was trying to tell him to go to the other line but he ignored. It got a little tense but eventually he left. Ok, so over to the buffet. Two gold cards in front of me in the President and Chairman only line just like the white kid in the players club. This time, they were Hispanic, though. Not only did the girl tell them to go to the other line like they did to the white guy but she actually helped them AS IF they were the highest limit people. Even to the point of interrupting my convo with her to answer their question. I think she could sense that I was a little annoyed so she tells me to go to a separate line after paying, to be seated. She said that it was the president line. So, I'm standing there and the seating host sits 4 groups before me. 4! I have always asked what is the point of being loyal and being higher card status and every time, the employees first response is...'you get to be in the front of the line'...ummm, well, apparently not. I physically pulled out my card and when the seating host saw it, her eyes nearly popped out of her head and she ran to me. So, here's the thing. Yeah, the Hispanic couple in front of me was two people so I was like...whatever they cut in a line in front of me just like the white kid did at the players club and the couple got special attention when the kid didn't but if she is going to try to fix the \"hookup\" she gave to the couple, MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THROUGH. The seating host clearly didn't know about separate lines or else she would've at least asked (I think). The cashier should have motioned to the seating host to make note. But, the seating host should have paid attention also. Just a horrible start. I'm not really big on pushing my player card status around on people but I almost feel like I need to. Because, otherwise, why am I being loyal to stations? I get the same crap server service either way. In fact, I think I even get worse because I don't tip 5 bucks like I used to anymore, per drink. I give a buck and 2 if I'm winning. I would give 5 and still get bad service so I stopped that. Tired of being disappointed. I will still give 5 to servers that have been consistently good, They know who they are. Anyways...so, I finally sit down. Took a good minute before the server got my order for my drink. I usually wait until I give the order to start eating. Finally, she comes. Off to the food. I hate to say but not one single thing looked good. Not one. And I had to search for a plate. There were no plates. Very small selection of food items. Very basic things. But, honestly, nothing looked good at all. Everything looked old, dark, drab and unappealing. The Asian section looked like complete garbage. Like it was leftover from some other restaurant that they just dumped in the steam table. Ugh. Even the Tex Mex looked pretty bad. I really have no words. For the price, it was not worth it. Yes, mine was comped but I would never pay for that. Especially if I'm a higher tier card. They don't seem to even recognize it. It's a \"who you know or what race you are\" vip. They completely ignore the card tier levels here. And, after returning from my second run, I was almost run over by my own server. Apparently, I'm less than anyone and I just always get this feeling that it's because I'm white especially after witnessing what I saw within the same hour that I mentioned in this earlier in the review.  I would not recommend this to anyone. Now that I'm staying on the west side, I do not see myself coming back.  P.S. Don't get me wrong, I didn't like the white kid in the wrong line just like I didn't like the Hispanic couple in the wrong line either. But, the players club \"chose\" to handle it the right way when the buffet \"chose\" to ignore and let it slip. Coincidence? Maybe, but, then it also happened to me and only when I revealed my card (even though I was supposed to be in the \"Presidents\" line, ) did it change. Coincidence? 3 out of 3? I don't think so. I think the staff is conditioned that way. Am I asking for them to change? No. I just know that white males are not really accepted here and I think anyone reading this review should know that."}
{"text":"iI use to frequent here when I lived in Henderson, and the food WAS pretty decent almost good back then but now I barely found anything I liked from the whole buffet, maybe just the small square cheese cake bite from the desert bar.  Came on a Wednesday around 2:30 pm. We waited quite a long time for mid week perhaps 35 minutes. For my first round I got mash potatoes, alfredo pasta, sausage. I took a bite of each and  didn't even finish one section of my plate, I set it aside and went for round 2 hoping I'd find something better.  So second round I head to the custom noodle grill. I concocted a bowl of garlic, mushrooms with just oyster sauce and beef. The cooks were friendly but I only wanted a small portion hence myself creating my bowl of ingredients. The ratio between the amount of ingredients and beef were ridiculous it was like a 1 whole bowl of beef to half amount of noodle and toppings. While I love huge portions of meat when getting something ala carte like a sandwich but lets keep in mind we are at a buffet. I felt like the beef was too much and it was a waste, food cost wise for the business and for customer.  The service was good but I wasn't impressed with anything."}
{"text":"A bit overrated.  During the week the price is ok but on the weekends it goes up and you can get a way better buffet on the strip for the same price.  The lines can be pretty long on Fridays and depending on where you sit you might wait awhile for drinks and dirty plates to be removed.  I don't know why but it's hard to get anyone to cook a steak well done and this place is no different, had him throw one back on the stove twice and it still was raw, so raw that the manager saw me waiting and waiting and came to my seat and saw it was still so bad he said he wouldn't touch it and gave me a comp.  The only reason I go back is because of the local discounts."}
{"text":"Huge fan of this place for the price.  Grab their rewards card and hit up the buffet. Its super cheap and a great deal. Yeah its no gourmet food but its a great deal for the price.  Its a hit and miss depending on what day you come.  I enjoy the prime rib usually but sometimes it can taste like wood. The salads are always fresh and delicious. Its always the first spot i hit up. Next would be the popcorn shrimp, its pretty tasty. It's weird that I like the quesadilla and carnitas are a good combo together.   The service is also hit and miss. The employees act as if they hate their job. Hardly see smiles. They come around every so often to grab plates, but usually my table is full of plates.  The deserts are bland and hard. You can tell theyve been sitting out.   Come here if your low on cash and very hungry. beware though that the food that day can be good or bad, take your own risk."}
{"text":"came here today with my husband and daughter. we waied for 45 mins and got literally 5 feet.   it was 230 pm and there couldnt have been more than 30 people in line. thats ridiculous. there were tons of empty tables too!   we can be hungry and wait but with a one year old, um i dont think do. peace out!"}
{"text":"This is in my parents' 'hood and after they made me sign up for a players' club card, $6.99 will get you the lunch buffet. During the slow summer months, it is even cheaper, $4.99.  If a small town feel could be possible in a cavernous casino, it is achieved here because the service is absolutely polite, very friendly and fantastic. Our drinks were refilled and our dirty plates taken away promptly, and the seater even came by later in the meal to ask if things were OK, which they definitely were!  The food is on par with buffets, but I found myself eating a lot because everyone was so nice here :)"}
{"text":"The food was good, our servicer was attentive and good..but, being 3:30pm on Tuesday, the line was only about 40 people ..my wife and I stood in line for nearly 35 minutes before getting to the lone cashier; the VIP line was unoccupied yet none of us were called over and all the while, no less than five hostesses stood and watched, none offering to open other registers to help move the line.  My wife and I will not visit the buffet again..this experience was unacceptable and unlike other Stations' Casinos buffets."}
{"text":"aww i remember the time when myself and everyone else i knew thought that downtown had the best seafood buffet. lol what did we all know only visitors that stayed in the downtown area. a friend of mine brought me here a few years back and I've always made it a point to come here for birthdays or when friends and family visit. this place is good to bring large groups, don't really know the price right now because they always seem to be changing last I know they were under $20 for dinner with players card.   When you walk right in you are greeted with a huge fake fruit and veggie stand. They have prime rib, which they'll throw on the grill if you want it a little more well done, grilled salmon, some times lamb chops, a Mongolian station that also makes kalbi korean short ribs, some chinese, an italian station with made to order pasta dishes, soups and salads, and a pretty good selection of desserts, cakes, pies, ice cream, and milk shakes.   And they have crabs legs lots of them and they're huge. they have them hot, cold, and even made to your order, add garlic, green onions, chili peppers, various sauces, if they don't have it at the crab station but have in another go ahead an grab it and have them add it. i usually tell them to add everything and just make it not too spicy. I'll also just have the plain hot crabs legs, grabs some garlic, butter, shoyu (soy) and have the pasta station make a sauce from those ingredients without the crab, then grab a large plate of steamed rice and go to town. i always did it that way to lobster when i was back in Hawaii.   busy a lot of times so expect the wait. have someone wait in line, leave um there and go do your thing. if their hungry they'll have no problems with waiting."}
{"text":"The Feast Buffet at the Red Rock is at nice step above a basic buffet. They have a huge seating area and lots of choices ranging from salads and fruits to carving stations to pizza to pasta and even sushi and Asian fare. It's not super fancy but you will find something to please most everyone.  One thing I noticed is that a lot of the food wasn't labelled on this most recent visit. I'm not sure if that's the usual, previous visits on one or two other occasions were years past.   Overall it's clean, well run & organized. You'll eat solid food and have the option to go back for more.   Lots of tasty looking dessert options - but I passed them up."}
{"text":"A vast selection but mostly average quality. Some standouts: carved turkey, health bar station with gluten free buckwheat pancakes (yum), farrow salad, grilled eggplant, banana cream pie and cappuccino gelato. There were undressed baked potatoes on the buffet and a great assortment of shredded cheeses on the salad bar to make your own stuffed potato. Two visits, two different servers, two very different experiences."}
{"text":"I've been to a few of the Green Valley casinos...while the others target the locals this one could be a special destination for any visitor to las vegas, particularly if you wanna spend some time at the nearby Red Rocks park nearby.  First of all the service was great. Everyone was incredibly nice and they didn't look harried or overworked (which is not to say they don't work damned hard, and we tipped them well for it). Our server came by several times and made sure we had everything we wanted. It was hard to believe we were at this huge buffet place, cos they purveyed intimacy.  For lunch, the first thing I hit (and it was paydirt) was the beef brisket station, which happened to be hauling major ass that day. Maybe it was that particular slab, but it was so tasty, and I've had my share of beef brisket across the loins of Texas, but this one hit the spot. That set the tone for the rest of the lunch, and maybe the fact that it was the first of this week's buffets and it's been awhile I've gone chomp crazy contributed to this otherworldly sensation in my mouth. Fried chicken, buffalo wings, chinese chicken wings, creamed corn, spareribs, mango ice cream and 15 lychees later, I was done. Sure, there were a few misses along the way (the orzo salad, bowtie pesto salad...I mean  do they defrost this or something...that buffet tastelessness syndrome was all over that), but the overall gestalt was that of GOODNESS.  I'm giving 4 stars not because I don't think it deserves 5, but ONLY because I haven't eaten buffet at the heavy hitters (Wynn, Bellagio, etc) and I would imagine spending $40 instead of $10 would result in a 5. (I mean it better damed...right?). But I had a lovely experience here....read it and weep."}
{"text":"I'd rather spend $12 gambling. At least there's a chance of coming out ahead. This is horrifying food with the exception of the gelato, sorbet and baked beans."}
{"text":"When I first moved to Vegas, I went the the feast buffet at red rock at least 5 days a week.......about 4 years ago things at the feast changed.  The breakfast became, well, not even worth $5 except for the first class service from the best server ever, Linda   Occasionally I would go for dinner and leave underwhelmed.......but went last night and I will summarize this way.....YUK.....   I'm speechless as I live the red rock but am done trying to deal with the sinking quality of the food and the presentation of the food   The sushi was like cardboard   Spanish rice was worse  Instead of reeling complaints I'll just say never again"}
{"text":"I'll say this... and the criticism is based on the potential and legacy...  I get a feeling of a downward spiral of neglect towards pride in competition and wanting to make this better here.  It used to be a strong solid buffet amongst it's peers.  If complacency is the fodder of mediocrity, I feel it's my duty to point out the flaws to ensure Feast Buffet knows they need to keep their eyes on the prize and regain their position as solid buffet in the competitive AYCE world of dining...  I had the Friday Seafood Buffet for $25, and it was pretty far off the mark.  The meat carving station beef was overcooked and a bit dry.  Another example is the Asian station's white Bao bread was clearly sitting for hours, as they were harder than croutons and not soft and fluffy.  They should have removed 'em as an option so people don't get a bad perception, or better yet, replace 'em with new ones.  The seafood itself like the snow crab legs were no better and probably worst than what an AYCE buffet eater would get at a local $9.99 Asian AYCE Buffet as the standard seafood fare.  The other seafood was mainstream stuff (shrimp, etc.)  you always see, so nothing unique.  Not like the Seafood Buffet at The Rio let's say.  With a local 2 for 1 coupon, this would be worth $12.50, but at $25, it's a hard meal to justify paying for.  I / we, didn't have one 'tho.  You can get more bang for you buck either with better quality or a lower price in other restaurants (or even the food court area) in the Red Rock or surrounding area.  The service was friendly but sub-par based only on neglect as opposed to being offensive, as they're seemingly understaffed (or at least that night they were).  In the heyday, The Red Rock was the quintessential place to visit... it was cool, hip and defined swagger.  The pool was where the beautiful people lounged, the Cherry nightclub was hip and hoppin', at night, the crowds were young and sexy.  Now, the Red Rock as a hotel casino is turning a bit more drab and stoggy and not in an upper crust old money or classy way, but in that it (The Red Rock as a whole) seems to no longer appeal to the beautiful people or the trendy movers and shakers anymore.   The buffet used to be a \"go to\" standard of excellence, so I'm not sure if the economy has forced 'em to cut corners or not (thus the locals and their 2 for 1 coupons, so maybe it's priced and formatted assuming most are paying less - - but if you're paying full price it's pretty harsh to justify and they should just lower the price universally and get rid of the coupons if they're looking to bring in tonnage of customers) but I'd like to give 'em another try and have 'em get back a \"*\" or two \"* *\" and earn a high praise recommendation that I used to highly tout about the place."}
{"text":"Their brisket melt in your mouth. And butter pecan ice cream oh man. I'd live off just those two."}
{"text":"I love coming to this buffet because of the price and food. Obviously compared to really nice buffets it doesn't stand a chance, but for its price its one of the best. Lots of options and really tasty. The servers are always really polite, although sometimes the people at the front who seat you can be extremely rude when u use your points to pay. My family is big and everyone has a card and they have their own points so we each pay seperetly but with the size of our family they always have a problem seating us together because of the gratuity they didnt charge cause we paid seperate, even though we always offer to pay it up front so that we can. They always give us attitude."}
{"text":"Went here for the Christmas dinner 12/25 at 130pm.Started with a romaine salad.They took romaine lettuce that was brown added a dressing that had too much vinegar,then threw some blue cheese crumbles on it , all to disguise the fact that it was old and wilted.The romaine is usually plain.Had a bagel with cream cheese and lox that was good.I had prime rib which was cold,there were spots of blood on the turkey breast so I just left it.What was supposed to be pecan-sage stuffing did not have a hint of either,and desperately needed at least some salt.Did not see any candied yams that was on the menu.The biggest disappointment was dessert.The menu said warm apple strudel,cheesecake,and pumpkin pie.They had no cheesecake,and i asked the dessert lady.They did have the strudel,but they do not even have the means of warming it because its put out with the rest of the cold desserts,way too much powdered sugar.Did not see pumpkin pie anywhere.Did have a piece of blueberry pie that was excellent.Been here numerous times the service is very good as it was this visit.There normal dinner and brunch menu has way more to offer than what they threw together for this \"special \"Christmas menu."}
{"text":"Seriously, cheap prices for a BOMB experience. Come here hungry....and expect to be pleased beyond your wildest dreams.  Been going there for 6 years and it doesn't get old."}
{"text":"This buffet was renovated a few years ago and looks a lot nicer at the food stations with granite counter tops. It includes a meat section, a small Asian food area, very small salad bar and a slightly larger dessert area. They also have a made to order steak option that costs slightly more. You can order hamburgers and pastas made to order as well.  The buffet is one of the smallest I have visited in Las Vegas and gets really busy during late lunch and dinner. This buffet offers a deal to Taxi drivers, so add extra time to your expected dinner as there are always a large group coming through. Be a member of the player's club to get a few dollars off.  The food is mostly hot but I'm not sure how often it gets swapped out for fresh food, so I only eat what looks popular to try to ensure some sort of freshness. If you are on a budget and want to take a few friends out to a buffet, try this one at Palace Station."}
{"text":"Red Rock has the top buffet for any of Station Casino's that I have visited. I have been here many times and up until a few years ago, I would go once or twice every six months. Go here when you want the premium Feast Buffet. The last time I visited, gelato was available in the dessert area. They also had salmon, which I had not seen at any of the other Feast Buffet.  Go for a late lunch and have a player's club card to get a few dollars off. The lunch is almost like dinner and it's about $5 dollars less expensive. All of the dishes I have tried over the years were tasty and I especially enjoy the spicy Thai noodles. They always prepare a generous amount of sushi.  The line might be long here during dinner, but definitely worth the time. Enjoy the excellent meat and Asian food sections. I will be going back soon to see what's changed."}
{"text":"Empty and dried up on a Monday evening not to mention the long wait to come in to crumbs. Will never come back or recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"I had the Thanksgiving dinner and breakfast the next morning. For thanksgiving dinner I had to wait in line for almost 90 minutes.  The food was basically average casino buffet.  There was not much selection in the salad bar or dessert bar.  The ice cream was good.  The prime rib was tender and juicy.  The asian station stir fried for you fresh, just put in the vegetable selection and tell the chef what kind of meat and what kind of sauce you want.  I had the kung pao sauce which was good.  The chef was actually Chinese.  I like the menudo soup.  For breakfast, I was glad I came early, there was almost no waiting.  The omelette that they made in front of you was so good.  The others were average.  Overall, decent food with a low price if you had the player's card."}
{"text":"Yum one of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas. Very good affordable prices in comparison to other casinos. I come here everytime to eat when we come to vegas. Lots of selection. There is even Kimchi. Food is very good there is typical salad, soup, Asian, Mexican, Italian and like I guess all american. Very nice location. I have come for brunch as well which included the same things but mimosas and breakfast items."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of buffets. I am a fan of leftovers, which they don't really approve of at buffets. However, my wife and dad love buffets. When we lived in Las Vegas we probably went to the Feast buffet about once a month with my parents. While I'm not keen on buffets, I do have to say that as far as buffets go, the Feast is pretty decent.   During breakfast/brunch, the pecan rolls can't be be beat.  During lunch and dinner, the gelato is a must.  Beyond those items, the Feast always has a wide variety of food and there is certainly something for everyone. Also, if you show your player's card you get a couple bucks off. If you like buffets, you'll love the Feast. If you're like me and usually hate buffets, you may actually like the Feast."}
{"text":"Overall very good quality food. Lot's of choices and great tasting. Great value for tve money spent."}
{"text":"Whoa...Aliante is far out there, but this casino is the most beautiful I have ever seen. Almost fitting that this is the true Las Vegas Casino in a desert. Why was I out here, when there was other major casinos? Well, I have to thank a friend for making me drive out there.   We were going to have a small reunion at this buffet and like I said, it was beautiful. This buffet is a combination of The Orleans French Market Buffet with Rio's World Buffet. The right price and elegant decor. The Feast Buffet has six stations (Asian, Tex-Mex, BBQ, American and Italian). Mainly, I was on the American, Tex-Mex, and BBQ).   OMG...They had Mac n' Cheese, my favorite. I had two to three plates of the magnificent comfort food. They had sub sandwiches which I took a lot of..lol. On to the Tex-Mex, uh-oh, I shouldn't have gotten it, because the meat was right off the stove that it burned my mouth..OUCH!! Finally was the BBQ section. Oh man, there was a lot of Back Back Ribs with a similar smell of Tony Roma's...I only got a plate of it.   There was one station that I forgot to get....THE DESSERT Station. After eating all that food, I was full!! So, I just got fruits (cantaloupe, watermelon, and grapes) To top off the trip, the Executive Chef came by and made sure we were doing fine. Now, that's class. In any history of a buffet that I have been to, I have never had an Executive Chef come to pay a visit. Now that's CLASS.   I don't have any figures since I didn't pay for the meal, but my friend did use her Station Boarding Pass for lunch. Looks like it was around $9.99 with the BP. This casino is a little far, but it sure is very classy in the middle of nowhere.   Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!"}
{"text":"The Feast buffet at Red Rock used to be so good. When it opened and for a few years, it was excellent. In the financial crisis, it went down a notch to good. Particularly noticeable was a shrinkage in variety, especially in salads. But in the past month or two, it has slipped again to mediocre. The three bean salad used to be excellent; it's now poor. The Italian pasta with sundried tomatoes had a very off taste. The pie crusts were no longer light and tasty. The bread pudding shrank from a moist pan to individual dried up items. The others in my party also commented on the mediocrity of most all of the foods. I care about food quality, especially taste, and the slide of Red Rock is a big disappointment."}
{"text":"This is a very, very basic buffet. You won't find a ton of dishes outside of the \"American\" section. No sushi, which is always sad.   That being said, the service is friendly and the dining room and buffet line are clean.   It's not my favorite buffet by a long shot, but with the price being comparable to what you'd spend on dinner for one person at a traditional restaurant, it's a good way to feed multiple people who can't agree on a cuisine."}
{"text":"This is probably the best of the Feast Buffets. We came on a Friday night, half expecting a nightmare line. There wasn't one!   It's prettier, decor-wise, than the other locations, but the layout of the tables is sorta weird. They really try to cram as many tables in as possible. Where there might be a nice big aisle between tables, they've decided to put little two-person tables. This makes the space between the tables very small and, if you're seated at that tiny table like we were, there are constantly people walking by, perilously close to dragging the bottom of their jacket through your food. If I return, I'll definitely be one of those pains in the ass that screws up the whole seating line by requesting a booth (normally, I hate those people, but this place definitely necessitates it).  Anyway, the main reason we came here was that I wanted a buffet that had sushi (and didn't want to spend $$$), so that's where I headed immediately. There were your basic 3 varieties of rolls; they were tasty! They definitely don't let the sushi sit out for ages. Aside from that, there are your basic areas: American, Italian, Mexican, Asian, salad and dessert.   Pretty basic buffet, slightly better quality than the other Feast buffets. I'd go again, if I happen to be in the area!"}
{"text":"This was not the best buffet I have ever been to, but it wasn't completely horrible either. It is on the smaller side for a buffet offering up your standard buffet fare. I would compare it more to your local Hometown Buffet than an extravagant Vegas-style buffet. I will say, however, that their meat was on point! I had the turkey and it was so moist and delicious. Others in our party raved about their roast beef as well. Also, the mac and cheese was super yummy (yes, I have the pallet of a 6 year old...).  The service was really good as well. We had a party of 17 people and our waitress didn't write down our drink orders but brought them all out exactly as we had ordered them! We were all really impressed. My only complaint about the service would be that they didn't clear plates quickly enough. We always had one or two plates in the middle of the table and people just started stacking their new plates on top of their old ones.  The best part about the buffet? The price! It's typically only $15  (you get what you pay for, right?) BUT, if you sign up for their member points card (which you can do for free) it knocks the price down to $8 a person."}
{"text":"An excellent buffet in a locals area of Henderson about 12 minutes from the Las Vegas Strip. I say locals because Sunset Station, the casino that this buffet is located in, actually offers deals to locals that have a players card.  Typically, during the off months of the year, this premium buffet will offer player's card specials from food to other perks. This is great because as a local, I go far out of my way to enjoy these perks.  I have been visiting Sunset Station and this buffet for many years, even before the full buffet renovation. This buffet now matches in many ways how the Red Rock Casino, another Stations property, buffet is setup and looks. The newer design and buffet choices makes this Feast Buffet one of my tops for Las Vegas based on price, location, ambiance and food offered.  Come here ready to enjoy a full food tour from the Asian section, Italian, Mexican, American, seafood, generous salad bar area that's completely free standing and finally the modest desserts area. As with most buffets, the desserts section has several shelves with delectable delights with and without sugar. I have no idea what desserts without sugar taste like, so your mileage may very. There is also an area to request a few scoops of ice cream. It is a mid-grade brand of ice cream that have a pretty good taste, better than you would find at a Supermarket. This is where I removed one full star off from my review. They used to serve gelato, which was way more awesome than standard ice cream.  The Feast Buffet at Sunset Station Casino is a great option to go out and enjoy one of the top in the city and it just happens to be a locals favorite too."}
{"text":"This place needs to get their act together! My family and I used to love this buffet and it was a real treat coming here for dinner. The waiters have been real lazy lately, they hardly come over to see if we need anything. My mom ordered tea, the guy placed the tea bag on the next table from her and when she asked where it was the waiter acted like she was stupid and flung the dish over to her. He didn't return at all during our sitting until we were getting up to leave and asked if we were okay. I'm standing up getting ready to leave, and now you ask if I'm ok? Wow...  For the past few months now the quality of the food has seriously been lacking!!! I'll describe my most recent experience, because it's enough to get my point across. I went for the Italian section and noticed the pasta was sitting there siting in a pool of water, as if it hadn't been drained (it probably hadn't been) and it seemed like half of it wasn't even cooked well! I took some because I was hungry and figured this was my only option for Italian that night. It was cold!!! Seriously!!! I ended up ordering it from the lady behind the counter since I knew then it would be fresh. That turned out well, thankfully! I also got a couple slices of pepperoni pizza, they were cold so I didn't end up eating them. I decided to go for some Mac n cheese, found that was also cold and tasted disgusting! It seemed like it had been sitting there forever. I ate a garlic stick and called it a meal.  Then it was on to dessert. Man, really they're gonna mess up dessert!!! That's like everyone's favorite part! The dessert was even worse than the entrees. First of all, they only had like 3 cake options available, when they usually have much more selection. Getting someone to help you behind the counter to get more slices out there is like trying to round up a taxi in the middle of the city. They'll even ignore you if you aren't obnoxious enough to yell for them. I usually have to scream for them to come over to help even the nice elderly people patiently waiting. It's really absurd! Well I grabbed the desserts that were available out of the select few, and found most of them were hard and gross, the only thing I could salvage to eat was the pecan pie, which seemed old also and overly sweet.  This is a buffet, I expect to be able to eat well and feel good after. I came home and had the runs from whatever I ended up eating that wasn't good. We paid good money to have a nice dinner, and that was a real poor excuse for a feast! Whoever runs this place needs to get the food quality in order as well as the service!!!"}
{"text":"Big disappointed!!!!  1star is seem to be too much for what they deserve. If you want to spend less money to eat below average food, so you could try. Food are tasteless, cold, and not cook properly-  too salty and too oily. I try almost every stations and end up throw away most of them. Only one station that I can enjoy was salad bar. For the amount of money that I pay here, I would rather pay 15$ more and drive to Studio B buffet at M resort.   For all the mom and dad, be aware that they charge full price for kids 2 years old up."}
{"text":"I didn't want to come here but ended up here because someone wanted buffet but didn't want to go to the Strip. The line is slow as molasses. We finally got in after waiting 40 minutes on a Monday night.   The food was terrible. No prime rib. Some well-done, dry, cheap cut of meat. Top round? The brisket looked awful. Mac-n-cheese, potato latkes, pretty much everything I had was bland.  This place is full of senior citizens. I think we were the youngest diners there. To top if off, one of the senior citizens who was sitting next to me was coughing and talking so loudly. Not that it's the restaurant's fault but it just made my dining experience more terrible.   Their desserts were weak too. The only things I was able to tolerate were some of the salad bar items. I should have gone to Sweet Tomatoes! I've been here for breakfast last year and it was decent for the price. I came here for lunch years ago and remember thinking it wasn't that great. If I ever want buffet, I will go to the Strip next time."}
{"text":"The food and the price is awesome you can't go wrong clean laid back friendly staff Lots of parking outside .why you want to pay more when you can get the same quality for less"}
{"text":"Damn this place is awesome, they have so many great food;  The BBQ ribs are to die for!! so r the mash potato w/ gravy  The Asian section was pretty good the pot stikers, egg rolls and shrimp r delicious! The Italian section was the best; I love the penne pasta and the calzone!!!! But  my favorite thing of all and the thing thats gonna make me go back to the feast buffet is the desert bar!!!! :)   cannolis, mmmmm delicious!!! cheese cake!..... yuummy pimkin pie!!! .....rich and creamy!! gelato!!.....  refreshing!!! brownies!!!...... looove them!! What you pay to eat is soooo worth it!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here on Mother's Day and waited two hours in line with people trying to cut and the woman infront of us trying to swindle the manger for a cheaper price so I was already expecting this place to be a disaster but once we got in after paying our 20$ a person, we were delighted by the amount of food they had. Feast had at least three different kinds of fish for anyone who doesn't eat meat and ton of stations full of delicious options. Our waitress was a dream and interacted with my daughter so it made me comfortable in this place.  I can't wait to return"}
{"text":"You don't just come to Vegas and not go to the buffet.  And yes, the buffet at the MGM is to die for. Mandalay Bay's brunch is noteworthy. The M seafood night buffet is a thing of legends.  BUT SOMETIMES YOU DONT GET PAID TIL NEXT FRIDAY a you know what I'm saying?  The Texas Station Buffet is a homestyle buffet that gets the job done. There's your Mexican station (Tacos made to order) American (red beans and rice, potatoes) BBQ (ribs, BBQ chicken, corn on the cob, sweet potatoes) Asian (stir fry, fried rice, dumplings) and Italian (pasta pasta pasta!) and there's also your dessert station which I avoid at all costs because there is so much goodness. Apple pie, cherry pie, lemon meringue, ice cream, sorbet, RAINBOW SPRINKLES!  What I'm trying to tell you is, for $10.00, you can be happy.  For $13.00, you can be happy and tipsy via a Margarita. Thank me later."}
{"text":"I stay buffet'ed down to my socks, so when it was time to go the station for dinner I began my breathing exercises and performed the usual aerobic stretches. Preparation is a major key.   Salmon and rice. Potstickers with a side of bbq pulled pork. Creamed spinach. Yams. Pasta. Roast beef. Salad. Love. I'm in love and I don't need no man.   I will continue to come back to the station because life is too important to order pretty good that doesn't do anything for me.   MAJOR shoutout to Roberto for his help. It's so important when customers feel like they have been able to voice their concern and receive help. Very happy with the experience!"}
{"text":"I must say Green Valley Ranch buffet never fails me whenever I'm in town this is the place to go it's clean food is always fresh and tasty and most of all customer service is amazing! Our server Kendra was great she is funny professional and fast! I hope to get her again on our next visit"}
{"text":"The buffet with the players card is $7.99 for lunch monday - thursday. Definately worth it; however, the sushi selection at lunch is bad, only  a few items and some of the rolls are really tiny, you could put 4 pieces in your mouth at once. The prime rib was okay, but not great and the chow mein and sweet & sour pork was great. Dessert was awsome, i had chocolate cream pie, banana cream pie, and cappucino gelato. Our server was good, checking on us more than buffet servers usually do."}
{"text":"My favorite buffet! Sunday morning brunch is the best $6 who could beat that??? and Mimosa's too! And if you join their rewards program you can get discounts everytime you come. My all time favorite dessert is located in here, banana bread with Carmelized syrup.. Sooooo amazing"}
{"text":"Sorry, Red Rock. I love you dearly, but this place is grotesque.   I don't like buffets as it is, but this has to be one of the worst. I would never have gone if it were up to me, but I was forced by some visitors in town. None of us were remotely satisfied with the meal. Everything was greasy and foul. We felt like we were all going to get food poisoning.   I will be back to Red Rock often, just never again to any buffet - however, if I am forced, it will most definitely not be this one."}
{"text":"Friday nights the Feast Buffet is the place to be. That's because it's seafood night - wait, I mean ALL YOU CARE TO EAT SEAFOOD. You can't go wrong with 11 plates of crab legs, 3 plates of shrimp, another plate of miscellaneous seafood, and a...wait for it...wait for it...diet coke. Well, if you did eat all of that you'll end up in the ER or praying to the porcelain gods all night in one fashion or another. I love their seafood offerings on Friday night and generally only go to this buffet then. The only problem is the line. If you're not there before 5:30pm be prepared to wait  a good hour.  Outside one of the big two buffets (those being the M and Bacchanal for me) they have one of the best dessert options in the buffet world. You can get hand scooped ice cream and they're kind enough to make milkshakes or malts.  A few buffet rules I'd like to point out: 1.) Don't eat in line, I promise, your food won't jump off the plate. 2.) It's not necessary to make that face when you don't like that specific offering, it's possible I do, or I did until I saw the way you reacted. 3.) THEY WON'T RUN OUT OF FOOD 4.) 60 minute time limit, tops."}
{"text":"In the sea of buffets at Vegas, Feast Buffet @redrockcasino has go to be on top of the list of great deal buffets. The prices at this buffet are very reasonable and you get your money's worth.  Breakfast: Monday - Saturday  8:00am - 10:45am $4.99 w/boarding pass card, $7.99 without boarding pass card   Lunch: Monday - Saturday 11:00am - 3:00pm $7.99 w/boarding pass card, $10.99 without boarding pass card   Dinner: Daily 4pm - 9pm $13.99 w/boarding pass card,  $18.99 without boarding pass card   Sunday Brunch 8am - 2pm $13.99  w/boarding pass card,  $18.99 without boarding pass card   I highly suggest getting a boarding pass card because you will save some $$ at the buffet. It's pretty easy to get one. All you have to do is sign up at the front of the casino and you ta da - boarding pass! :)  There is a lot of selection at this buffet. It's international with different stations dedicated to foods from around the world. They have Japanese (sushi), Mexican (fajitas, quesadillas), Chinese (orange chicken, bao, fried rice), American (mini hamburgers, mac and cheese) and Italian (pizza, pasta). They also have an awesome dessert area (pies, cupcakes, cookies, cannolis, brownies) and a gelato bar! There is so much food, I just can't list it all!  I've been here for Sunday Brunch and lunch and they actually have pretty much the same offerings. Sunday Brunch just has champagne, mimosas, an omelet bar and breakfast goodies like eggs, bacon, sausage, corn beef hash and breakfast sweets like donuts, muffins and croissants.  I tried out the omelet bar when I was here. I got a vegetarian omelet and it was great! It had a good share of different veggies and nicely made.   The gelato bar here is my favorite! Some of the flavors they had were: mint, vanilla, raspberry, caramel, strawberry and spumoni! The spumoni and caramel were  excellent. Sweet and creamy, it's the perfect dessert at lunch or dinner or even breakfast brunch (hehe). Gelato and Vegas, how can you go wrong?  Lots and lots of selection with decent prices! Don't forget to get your boarding pass for even more savings! :)"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. It's crowded and not worth the wait. The only reason it's probably as busy as it is is because the other places to eat in the casino aren't that good and are very expensive.  I would not recommend this Buffett. The only thing that tasted decent was the salad and few items at the Italian station. Our party of six ate from all the different stations and only the person who ate the Italian was happy."}
{"text":"Most likely superior to buffets on The Strip. Mom and I are regulars and love to feast at the Feast. The wide selection of Asian, Italian, Mexican and American cuisine is always a treat. It's hard to stay away from the fried rice and pizzas, which are always prepared by chefs that care. Which leads me to my next point.  The food is prepared with great care, which is made crystal clear by the guys prepping the pizzas. It may not be 10 star cuisine in luxury accommodations, but The Feast gets the job done."}
{"text":"A good food selection and decent service.  Minus two stars for the delicious food I couldn't eat because of the excessive SALT.  There is a salt shaker on the tables, just let us do it ourselves."}
{"text":"Garbage food. Im literally only eating because I've already paid for it. Walking the buffet line looking for my next food item, was like choosing which instrument I'm going to be beaten with."}
{"text":"My mother is a big fan of the Sunday crab leg brunch at this place, and I usually get pretty excited when she calls me up and asks if I want to go.  The answer is always yes.  Now, seriously, the crab isn't that good.  But for an all-you-can-eat deal, what do you expect?  Some of my family think it's awesome and just eat plate after plate of crab.  I might sample a leg or two until I remember why I only ever have a leg or two.  But the other stuff, for buffet food, is pretty great.  Their omelets at the omelet station are always tasty.  Pretty much good breakfast stuff all around (I'm a sucker for their biscuits and gravy).  The salad bar is plentiful and fresh and they always have a prime rib and turkey breast out to be carved.  The quality of everything is consistent visit after visit."}
{"text":"It used to be good but since the price went down so has the quality of food. If your looking for a cheap buffet and not to picky on food choices then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"It's very rare that I love buffet food, but this food was absolutely delicious with the exception of some really hard churros! LOL the reason for not getting 5 stars was the servers were extremely rude in different stations not just one, I did get one of the names, Nora in ice cream department was so not friendly, like the prime rib station person as well. I would like to mention the waiters thankfully were very pleasant!"}
{"text":"We live on the west side and go to this buffet 2 or 3 times a month and love it. The price is great and the quality of food is always good and the salad bar is always fresh. Lunch is 7.99 with a players card."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting and some family members were staying here so my little bro and I took the journey from The Strip alllll the way out to Aliante. They had $100 credit from the hotel, so the 6 of us decided to eat at this buffet. We went downstairs on a Tuesday night (two days before thanksgiving) & were relieved to find a rather short line and a big sign that said \"HAWAIIAN NIGHT Every Tuesday!!!\" Um, whoa! Sa-weeet!! Three of us are from Maui so we were super happy to see that sign.   We were seated promptly and our waitress was very sweet. Excellent customer service.   Now, we didn't expect the food to blow us away. You should never expect that from any buffet. Anyway, it was satisfying. Besides the \"Hawaiian\" Food (lechon - a whole roasted pig, kalbi ribs, haupia, etc), they had a Chinese bar, which was cool. They had steamed dumplings, yummy fried rice, sweet sour pork, etc. They also had a mexican bar with fajitas and enchilladas, and an Italian bar. Of course I focused on the Hawaiian food (which I was happy to see that they did NOT toss pineapple on random items and call it 'Hawaiian'). The food was satisfying but it doesn't reach the level of awesomeness that you can reach with the food in Hawaii. Duh.   The dessert bar was cool. Your usual pies, cake, cookies, fro-yo, and ice cream. An attendant scoops your ice cream for you and adds whatever type of toppings you want.   I think the buffet would have costed us $17.99 per person, which is honestly a little pricey for the quality of food. It wasn't terrible, but I am glad that it was free for us!"}
{"text":"I'd rank this as the highest end Station Buffet you can find.  When it comes to lunch and dinner it is worth the extra cost.  However at breakfast time you can save some money and get a similar meal (including the champagne) at Sunset Station. If you arrive at either buffet at opening the lines are not too bad, if you what until mid-morning you're going to wait a long while."}
{"text":"Cheap eats at a good price. If you want a similar meal to what you'd get at the Green Valley Ranch without the high price...visit Sunset Station.  Breakfast is where they shine."}
{"text":"This is reasonably priced good buffet food, ample choices.  Staying at the hotel, I was able to avoid the long lines for dinner.  There were asian dishes, italian, your typical around the world buffet including sushi.  I liked the fish collar grilled, the dim sum, the gelato desserts.  Oddly their salads were the worst of their choices, but thats ok because I dont go to buffets for the salad.  Tonite, sweet potatoes got me, plus tom yum soup.  I just like everything I ate and the price with players coupon? $50 for 4!  ooh lala."}
{"text":"Not *the* most amazing buffet I've been to, and the line is a little out of control, but it's pretty good...for an omnivore. Now, I'm a vegetarian, and chilled mostly at the nacho bar and mongolian wok, since pretty much everything else had meat it it. However, my partner isn't veggie, and she had a blast, trying a plate of this and that. Her verdict is that the Chinese food is delish, the Italian could use some help and everything else was tasty, but not amazing.  Our service was great, with quick drink refills and plate clearing. I personally was disappointed in the dessert section, as that is what I was saving room for, and found that most of the desserts where too dry, too sweet, or tasted wrong. That said, the little shooters of tapioca and tiramisu were absolutely fabulous.  I might come back, but when they're having the lower prices; for a vegetarian, it isn't worth the super high regular cost."}
{"text":"We tried almost all the Station buffet and this is one of the best! We love the Salad bar here. They also have the 2 for 1 coupon thats why we always come here. It is lesser people compare to other station buffet."}
{"text":"Cold food, dry meat,  partially cooked pasta, dry desserts.  I'm glad it was at least edible...    but having flys on my food is no bueno......"}
{"text":"Overall it's a very clean and casino with lots new slots to choose from. However I had issues with the the long line and wait time at the Feast buffet. Its a Tuesday lunch which most of the tables were empty,  but it took them 30 minuets to find a table for us?! Then the older Filipino lady that took us to the table started to yell at us. Simply because our receipt says 6 and we have 7 in our party which includes my 2 years old son. I told her wait a minute, the cashier at your buffet wrote that down and the lady standing at the front already told you we had 7 in our party. Why are you giving us attitude?! She just gave a whatever facial expression and walked away. We didn't want her ruin our trip so we just gone with our business. Then comes the kicker, my wife swiped the players card and it said you have won a Starbucks coffee but the printer is not working. Please go to the reward club to obtain the print out. But when we got there and told the lady about it. Her response was I don't know anything about free Starbucks coffee, go to another machine and try again. I honestly think this is a very good casino with mostly good staffs. But some of them need to be retrain, so issues like these won't turn your customers away."}
{"text":"Guess it's been awhile since I've been here.  Has seriously gone downhill.  You would think with a buffet you could find something good.  Not yesterday for lunch.  The chicken was dry, mac and cheese was odd tasting and cold.  Soup was too salty.  Bad choices and lacking in quality.  This buffet used to be pretty decent.  Guess they are trying to save money by serving old and crappy food.  Not to mention that the entire establishment was too warm.  Maybe the a/c was not working?!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place. I don't. We have been here several times and I still am not impressed. Although they have many choices, I have not been able to find anything that taste good besides the $2 margarita."}
{"text":"It appears they may have a new Executive Chef as the quality of the food has gotten pretty bad. Today there were Cinnamon rolls on the buffet that were clearly burnt and black. Very disappointing,  this used to be one of or favorites!"}
{"text":"Chicken parmesan was very salty, the chicken pasta was cold and had no chicken at all, just sauce and cheese, was difficult to get bonitos attention.  He offered my friend a refill and when I tried to ask he walked off.  Carrot cake and others was very dry the coconut pie had no flavor, ice cream was good but station was an uncleaned mess.     Also other foods I ate were good."}
{"text":"I came here sunday with my grampa we got here about 11 am and there was a good size line.It only took about 25 minutes to get in and seated.  First plate-Slice of cheese pizza,little cheros,biscuit,ranch dressing,chicken fried steak,mashed potatos.The pizza was moist and yummy,cheros always a good chose,ranch was good,but the mashed potatos wernt that grate.The chicken fried steak was amazing.  Second plate-2 more chicken fried steaks,bread stick,waffle,surup,more ranch,roll,another buis.and some crewtons.The breadstick was bland,as were the crewtons,the woffle was very good and so was the roll.  Dessert-brownie,some choco cake thing,1 scoup of mint chockolate chip,1  scoup of vinnilla.Everything was amazing exept for the cake thing wasnt very good."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because the omelets and service was excellent.  Plus they didn't mess up the bacon.  If this was the normal breakfast I would give a solid 4 stars at least.  However at $55 for 3 people, I feel like they are running a scam.  They charge brunch prices at 9 am but do not have the staff there to serve all the brunch items.  There is no one manning the ice cream station.  No one was at the Mongolian bbq station until after we were done eating.  They only had one omelet station going with a lot of people in line.  In past they had sushi, they should not wait til lunch to put it out if they are charging a brunch prices for the whole timeframe.  My whole point is if you say brunch is this time to that time, the menu should be the same the whole time."}
{"text":"We stayed at The Palace Station and wanted a quick breakfast so we had the breakfast buffet and for $6.49 with The Palace Station boarding pass (and you can sign up without being a hotel guest).  They have donuts, pastries, desserts, soft serve ice cream, fruit, bagels, toast, omelets and eggs made to order, tacos, sliced ham, hash browns, oatmeal and cream of wheat, cereal."}
{"text":"Review is for the breakfast buffet only.  Family gathering for the Feast Buffet yesterday. Awesome service. I don't remember her name; the only thing I remember is that she's Japanese.   The place looks great! Modern and clean. Doesn't smell or feel old.  Breakfast wasn't bad - could do without the items (Chinese & Italian)  that looked like the previous night's leftovers. A nice touch was the grill man who could cook you up items, made to order.   I'm sure lunch and dinner may be better but for the breakfast buffet, it's OK."}
{"text":"I thought this place was clean and well stocked. There was nothing remarkable about the food though- I never thought about going for seconds on anything. The casino people run around trying to get you to sign up for their card which significantly drops the price of the buffet. Okay but won't be back."}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast and it was easily one of the worst buffets I've been to in the morning.  Fake eggs, super processed fast food-esque style bacon, hash was flavorless and undercooked, no crepes, and the pancakes were tough.  The only good things about my family's experience there is that the donuts were some of the freshest I've had in years anywhere.  And our server was very nice and attentive.  I don't think I'll be back unless they start serving real food!"}
{"text":"This is HANDS DOWN, my fave buffet in Vegas/Henderson!!!  Every time I visit the parentals, they know we have to go to dinner here.  The stir-fry crab legs & shrimp are my favorite thing in the world!  Delicious!!!!  I try not to waste my time on much else but the rest of the food stations are really good as well.  Great sauteed & grilled veggies."}
{"text":"This buffet should be shut down. Its a shame that red rock has introduced no changes at all in its buffet items. Its gone from bad to worse. The staff looks overworked and underpaid. No one smiles. It is like a zoo. Food tastes awful. Cutting corners to control expenses is fine but with Red Rpck needs to revisit its buffet items and the staff helping in that section."}
{"text":"I live on the south end of town so I am not always at this casino as all the other residents of Summerlin may be. However, when it is not overly hot in Vegas, this has become a favorite monthly spot to frequent after a medium-strenuous hike up Red Rock Canyon! Shrimp cocktail are small, Asian menu is adequate and the prime rib and is standard/above average for a Vegas buffet.  The Mexican and Italian menus are standard to me as well. My two favorite dishes are their pulled pork and chocolate ice cream! I believe M Resort's buffet still has a slight edge over this one in terms of off the strip casino buffet as well as selection. But overall the the buffet with or without the casino reward card is cheap and you get great value for how much it costs."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast buffet here.  During the week it's $7.99 with your players card.  Breakfast is till 10:45.  If you get in before they let you stay for lunch.   The food is plentiful.  From fruits to cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, and more!  The staff is usually great here  Decided to check out Sunday brunch.  It was $16.99 with a players card.  We waited in line for a long while.  I was looking forward to this!    Yay!!! We paid and will be next to be seated.  Everything is usual.  We order our drinks and off we go!  What's for brunch!? Nothing fancy the usual as if you were to come on the week day.  I don't understand the double price.  Pretty disappointed.    Our server JOSE!  I don't know if he was overwhelmed or he jus didn't like us.  I asked for a refill twice and the third time he came back he saw me and was had that look like oops!  And he said you wanted something?  I forgot!  I was like yes my lemonade please, I said it with a smile.  Towards the end of our meal I asked for a few more napkins,  2 napkins between the both of us at a buffet,  we couldn't do it lol.  He's gone for awhile and he comes back and sees me and has that look again!  He steals some napkins on the table across from us,  which the people were jus seated and went to get some food.  I couldn't help my self,  I start laughing!  LMFAO.  By this time,  I'm in satisfied with my meal, just irritated that I skipped the ice cream.    Never again!  I will stick to the breakfast buffet."}
{"text":"Wir waren enttäuscht vom Buffett im Red Rock Casino. Hier im einzelnen die ausschlaggebenden Faktoren:   + große Auswahl an Speisen  + leckere Desserts   - Service sehr langsam  - 30 min Wartezeit, sehr unogranisiertes Platzieren der Gäste, wodurch die Warteschlange verursacht wurde  - das Prime Rib und Shrimp Special war nicht zu sprüen, kaum Auswahl bzw. das Prime Rib haben wir gar nicht entdeckt  - viele der Speisen waren leider kalt  - umständliche Bauweise der Anrichten, so dass man sich beim Auftun der Speisen verbrannt hat oder die Arme nicht lang genug waren, um an den Löffel zu gelangen  - die meisten probierten Speisen schmeckten fad"}
{"text":"Long lines at 5pm. Apparently, all of the busses were sick today. Took forever to be seated due to unclean tables. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Went for brunch recently with visiting family. Staff very accommodating with toddler & seating. Server prompt & attentive when leaky beverage glass appeared.  Food was plentiful & tasty."}
{"text":"the best thing is when they make fresh burgers. I find the food lacking. Desserts are ok"}
{"text":"Eh...for the price ($10 at dinner with a 'rewards card' that you can get for free next to the buffet instead of paying the regular $14) it wasn't bad but I surely won't be running back. All the food is pretty tasteless/basic and you are really just going to stuff yourself. The line wasn't bad on a Monday evening (about a 10-15min wait) but the food was really unimpressive. I would honestly rather pay the extra $20-30 for a great buffet in downtown. But I suppose if you are a local and are looking for cheap/junky eats it might hit the spot. The pizza was 'decent'. Staff was nice."}
{"text":"So I've been here several times as I often get food comps from the casino.  There is a fair selection of food, weekends has a option (prime rib and seafood if you're into it). The staples are an Asian section, a small Mexican station and an Italian station. There is an American/BBQ station as well. The American station consists of items to make up a thanksgiving dinner type of plate, the turkey is good, but it's just pretty plain. The Asian station is my favorite, the veggie egg rolls are comparative with ones I've had back home in CA, and the egg drop soup is good.  Italian station is pretty gross, the Alfredo is always very very thick (like the texture of mayo - no joke). Mexican station consists of bland rice and beans and some ground beef. The desert station doesn't much of anything; cookies, \"shooters\" some bland brownies and ice cream.  Is the food worth $16 and a tip? Not if you're paying - but if the casino comps it, it's good enough.  Also, don't bother going at all for breakfast - so nasty."}
{"text":"OVERALL PROS: - Decent food, if you know what to get. - Great price (in Jan they had a deal for $4.99 before 10am). - Very well decorated, well run, good service. - LOTS of selection, from a dessert bar to barbeque to Italian to Japanese to a fruit/salad/fresh section. - They have omelette and stir-fry stations where you choose the ingredients and a chef cooks it right there. - The meat was really good (steaks, sausage, ham). - The cheesecakes (which open up at lunch, 11am) were delicious. I tried the hazelnut. - I really liked this granola/milk/raisins/apples mixture they had at breakfast, as well as the corn bread pudding. Delicious.  OVERALL CONS: - The sushi was horrible. Stale, dry, bad quality seafood. - Pizzas also looked incredibly old and stale and oily. I didn't even touch that."}
{"text":"Sunday dinner was okay, not bad but not good. Better than some stations though. But mediocre non the less. Spend a little more for quality!"}
{"text":"Customer service was HORRIBLE.  It was about 8pm on a Tuesday evening and we accidentally entered into the wrong line.  They would NOT speak to us or help us out standing in the wrong line.  0 customers in line so with this in mind, imagine 5 employees standing in a group looking like high schoolers just watching us and not helping us.  1 being the Manager.  I kid you not.  A lady with a heavy accent was our server and she had to be reminded 3 times to refill my Husband's tea.  He was so angry he tried to find a Manager and couldn't.  While she brings his refill finally after 8 minutes, she stops at the table next to us and pulls her phone out, SITS HIS TEA ON THEIR TABLE and begins showing them pictures from her phone!!  We work so hard for our money and this was supposed to be a treat since we missed the buffet last Friday as we showed up too late.  Google posted the wrong closing time a lady told us so we got there at 8pm.  We were rushed to sit down and forgotten about totally when leaving.  Never again in my life will I go here!  No matter seafood or not.  I will say the Italian food was awesome.  Taco bar with no ground beef??  Chicken only.  They got a \"F\" at the Mexican Food section, \"C\" in the Asian Food section, \"B\" for the American Food and \"A\" for the Italian Food.  I won't be going back...ever."}
{"text":"I hate to admit it but we came here on monday night. I have been here before and I think it` s the best buffet in Vegas not to say all the \"stations\". It`s clean and food always great!!!!"}
{"text":"Well what use to be my favorite buffet has slowly but surely dropped off the radar. Yes they have options, it is clean and the wait staff is attentive the food is taken a dive. They went from crab legs and prime rib to frozen french fries and hot dogs. The capability to be great again is there they just need cooks that care again. Prices are ok for you can eat dinner for $9.99. Just be prepared for the average and. It to be wowed."}
{"text":"It's a Vegas buffet and with casino players club card it's cheap!  Salad bar is good and if you get there at around 10:30 you can have breakfast and lunch for the low breakfast price!  Service varies on who you get! Roll the dice and feed a big family for cheap!"}
{"text":"Wow, very surprised how bad it was considering its part of the Station family. Especially being the original I thought for sure it should be the best, but instead the worse. If you remember the buffet in Vegas Vacation, this was the scene. Fortunately there were name cards above the food so you knew what it was suppose to be. The only thing that looked appetizing was the roast beef. Which I ate, along with some steak fries. Even when they brought out fresh items to replace, they were just plopped on top of the older food. The dessert station was ok. I thought it was smart to do small desserts. However it was kind of a turn off at the server throwing them around on the sheet tray, and if one fell (which there were two) on the floor, it was an \"oh well\" attitude.  The atmosphere is ok, nothing special. The booths are also very tight. About a foot and a half of room between the benches. Not the best if you have long legs. Our waitress was a jewel. So sweet and attentive. Hopefully with all the upgrades and improvements at Palace Station, the Feast Buffet will be one along with improving the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place its really nice, and service is great. I just wish they had more variety on the Chinese food section"}
{"text":"Great breakfast buffet--I went on Saturday morning at 8:00 when they opened up (a line 30 people long). Better than any I've ever been to with a waitress that kept refilling my coffee cup as well. They had anything imaginable for breakfast--better than Shoney's!"}
{"text":"I think it was only $7.99 per person, and for that you could definitely find something to eat that is decent there.  They have a variety of stations including Mexican, Indian, Italian and a smattering of Asian dishes which were all acceptable or mediocre.  The carving station had dry roast beef, but yummy ham and good turkey.  With it came all the traditional side dishes, stuffing, good mashed potatoes etc.  There was a nice, fresh salad bar and also plenty of fruit.  you could easily go healthy here, which is hugely beneficial.  If you are not going healthy then you will be glad to hear that the dessert station is the definite highlight with a employee scooped ice cream station with about twelve very quality flavors.  Yummy bread pudding and cobblers that you can sop with vanilla sauce.  For the price I would definitely return.  Also, my three year old loved it as they had all her favorite starches in spades."}
{"text":"This buffet is at red rock hotel which is a little out of the way but for the price it's really great. We paid something like $8 (when signing up with our drivers license as a member which is free) and the breakfast buffet was amazing -great quality too"}
{"text":"For cheap buffet the food is actually good and they have chefs making omelets in the morning. Then they have a chef making custom pastas for you. If your in Vegas and going broke and what to fill your belly for less than 25 bucks eat at feast b"}
{"text":"When I come to town, this is one of several buffets I try not to miss. First time coming on a friday, it was crab feed  night, they had it done three ways, chilled or steamed or pick your own and have them recook with butter garlic green onions and tomato(yum).  One note, next time, I would crack the crab first and add shrimp so the flavour will reach meat. The Chinese bbq spare ribs were great as usual, pretty much everything is their consistent good."}
{"text":"Yes pineapple juice!!  Great mushroom soup, first time I tried roast pork, real real good. Great ice cream/sorbet. Took pics of what I ate.  Everything was fresh and good. This is another of the places I always come to when in town.  You won't be sorry. They don't have seafood night on friday and saturday like some of the other places in town but i'm not a big seafood fan anyway so no big loss for me."}
{"text":"The buffet is huge and delicious! Arrived late and expected leftovers, but to my surprise they were still making fresh food. The server was friendly and responsive. For $15 this buffet is certainly worth the price."}
{"text":"Staff is incredible to VIP guest! VIP guest get to skip lines and get seated super pronto! My fave is the halibut found in Asian section. Also found in the Asian section is there cucumber salad right next to the sushi... If you know what lumpia sauce taste like, that's exactly the dressing for the cucumber salad, taste ok but I've had better. As for fresh fruit, I'm happy that Feast Buffet offers fresh lychees! Delisssh! Ok and you can't beat $6.99 for lunch buffet! I don't know if that's just weekend price but still $6.99 is amazing price for buffet. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Affordable prices when you use your players club card. A wide variety of foods for breakfast and brunch.  They have made to order omelets, bbq, gumbo, red beans and rice, hush puppies, Chinese galore, dessert bar and more. Friendly wait staff that actually come back to check on you!!! Love it...Well be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"I ate there for lunch today and my stomach has been acting up and I've been to the bathroom all day today wish I didn't eat there today. The only thing I had different from the wife was the fried chicken so I'm guessing it was that."}
{"text":"The buffet is awesome and a great deal.  It is kinda far from the strip but well worth the drive specially if you get the players card.  There is a great selection of food on the buffet and the quality is excellent.  I have yet to be disappointed.  I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch, complete with Mimosas, Champagne, and Shirley Temples. Sounds great, right? In my personal opinion, the mimosas being strong was the only good part about brunch other than our server being an absolute sweetheart.  The eggs were undercooked, prime rib was tough, and the wait was nigh interminable."}
{"text":"The food isn't that good. Sushi tastes like nothing, desserts were okay, the baked beans were good, but the best thing hands down was the fresh pasta. You can have them make you a pasta dish and it's completely fresh and so delicious. Other than that this place isn't good."}
{"text":"Went to Sunday brunch. Service was good. Higher price because champagne included but only premium item is shrimp not included normal lunch or most dinners I think. Otherwise standard Station Casino menu. No Caesar salad or mouth watering prime rib. Buffet values on strip better."}
{"text":"Obvious cutbacks in the last year. Food quality is slipping but the service is great as always."}
{"text":"Super reasonable buffet.  Food was good in most places.  Clean.  Service was a tad slow but it was a busy Sunday night.  We had kids with us and they loved the variety."}
{"text":"We went to Las Vegas last week to visit family and decided to head all the way out to Red Rock to hit up their buffet.  It was Saturday and their Prime Rib buffet was $15.99 (if you had a player's card).  That deal could not be beat.  I think I sampled a little bit of everything and obviously it wasn't going to be as good as a steakhouse or somewhere with a $50 buffet, but it was well worth the money!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was a great value at $8.99 for dinner. When I walked around at first I was like \"wow, this is it?\" I've seen larger kitchens inside of private homes. But after walking around the casino and checking out the prices and looking at what others were eating, I decided to come here. I found a few nice dishes and piled up the salad so I didn't go into a carb coma. I thought the cheesecake was one of the best I've had at a buffet.  Buffets require premeditated planning in order to not regret them afterwards as you lay on your bed or keeled over feeling as if you are ready to bust.  Helpful tips for those coming into the danger zone: eat slowly and aim not to waste! Just nibble on what looks good to test it out first then go back if you like it! Those who disobey these rules often end up shaped like a sphere. Heed caution and enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of the best buffet I've ever been to.  They no longer have the King crab selection at a reduced price but the quality of food is still very good.  I like the roast beef but I tired every station and was not dissappointed."}
{"text":"horrible service this time, the seater was more concerned with his friends then helping paying customers. His name was (Hollis). we come here all the time because it's close and semi inexpensive. But when you wait in line for 45mins and get treated like 2nd class It really makes us think twice about returning. normally the service it decent at worst. most of the time it's good."}
{"text":"The four of us came here for lunch after a morning hiking around Red Rock Canyon.  This buffet is superior to most on the Strip, regardless of the price.  But when you're only charging $11 for this feast, then this place is a must stop whenever out this way.  My kids loved all the offerings they usually hover around.  They were choosing some healthy food options also, which is rare.  The made dishes were also top notch.  Had some flavour to them.  Service was also better here than most as our drinks were always topped up.  Our server must have been by 5-6 times over the meal.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"There is a reason why this place is sooo cheap: the food.  For two it's less than $11 for breakfast! You can't beat that deal, sure, but the food... Oh the food... Did I lose my appetite oh too quick...   Can't complain though, I got what I paid for. You really can't beat a buffet for $4.95."}
{"text":"We come here a couple times a month and love the service and get recognized for being regulars wich is cool! Food can kinda be a hit or miss but over all pretty good!"}
{"text":"The quality of this buffet has really gone downhill. There was hardly and different types of food to choose from and what was there was not good quality. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Friday Night Seafood buffet in town. We always like to come to the GVR for crab legs!"}
{"text":"Love this buffet! On seafood night the crab grilled to order is the best!!"}
{"text":"Terrible Service Went to eat with my 88 yr old mother. Asked the Hostess for a seat closed to the  front of the buffet line. They took us to the  sitting area across from the Asian food section. When we tried to seat in the front ( the area was empty) the hostess Jessica told me that the area was closed. So instead we had to sit in the back.  Needless to say my mother was upset. I will never go back. They can keep it closed forever."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying for the price, the breakfast buffet ($4.99) is the best deal in town. Seriously. They have two chefs that make omelets with your choice of ingredients. The qualify could be a little better, but for the price...again...what are you expecting 5-star? Yeah right. All the usual breakfast items are available and lots of it. If you go on Sunday be prepared to pay $9.99 for a brunch. We didn't know that and were pissed. I still thought it was a deal though.   I'm not sure about dinner, but lunch seemed decent.  Breakfast is the real winner."}
{"text":"Average. Hot items were hot, cold items were cold. Nothing extremely exciting or original. We had Sunday brunch. It's worth the price."}
{"text":"I eat here twice a month. Great selection and the prices are great. Friendly staff and nice environment. It's nice to have a great casino/hotel off of the Strip next to the  beautiful Ref Rock Mountains. Yet, you are only 10 minutes drive from the Strip."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 2 separate reviews  one on the food that would be a awesome 5star but the customer service was just not there.  Its been a minute since we had visited this place. Assuming everything should be about the same as usual  We get on line. We had a party of 3 families (each family paying their own bill) at first the cashier tells us that we had to pay a gratitude upfront of 15% because it was a group of 10+!!! Why if we have separate bills.  Also that we could only use the boarding pass for 2 @$10.99 and that the rest would be  regular @$15  one of the guest is a 84yrs old so I asked if she could get a Senior Discount. NOPE NO SENIOR DISCOUNT!!!  Almost 10minute later we get pass the cashier. The person seating us want it to send one part of the group to the right side and the other to the left side. Hmm no can you seat us near to each other. With a attitude but finally we get seated. Once seated I ask my sister to ask for my drinks when the waiter comes. The waiter gives her attitude oh you're ordering for that table too.  Food delish,  Despite the plates staking up and no drinks refills. half way to our breakfast another lady comes to ask if everything was ok and then just said she would talk to the waiter. Not too Happy With The Service."}
{"text":"Beware of the server, Brenda!  We sat through a nice meal that ended in a slew of innappriopriate comments made by Brenda. My grandfather has suffered from a medical condition resulting in hand tremors for years and apparently this waitress mistook the tremors for drunkeness. As such, she deemed it necessary to supply judgement in the form of comments such as \"Just suck on your ice cubes, you're drunk anyway\" and \"here you go, drunk puppy.\" My grandfather had less than a single glass of wine. The comments were hurtful and rude. A manager was alerted to the problem, but I would recommend finding an equally good buffet elsewhere.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Service was good. Good variety of food to choose from. Very affordable. Nothing amazing, but we went during brunch. I tried the mashed potatoes they put out right before we left and those were very, very good, but didn't try the other lunch/dinner stuff."}
{"text":"For a lower tier hotel, Feast Buffet is pretty strong overall.    I've only had the breakfast and was pretty impressed with the overall selection.  In addition to a fresh cut turkey, ham, endless bacon, and a strong omelet bar (made to serve) they have some regional fare as well, such as Mexican and Tex-Mex offerings.  Throw in some Italian pastas, and Asian cuisine as well.  Many of the items are fresh and surprisingly pleasant for a $6.49 breakfast such as the smoked salmon and cheese blintzes, however, a few items could use a bit more care.  The pizza dough seemed of the generic variety, and a few seemingly frozen bulk varietals like the popcorn shrimp dot the landscape.  It's also weird (at least to me) to see generic chocolate pudding and lime Jell-O offerings for a breakfast bar.  But again, there was some great Mexican machaca, tex-mex potatoes, and southern style cheesy hominy.  Also, don't pass up the eggs benedict, very nicely done.  On Sunday's they have bottomless mimosas for adults, which was cheap champagne and generic orange juice, but again, you're paying only $6.49.  Actually, if you get a casino rewards player's card, you can even bring the price down further, I think it was $5.99.  Not bad.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating to our large party, including access for wheelchairs and were prompt at cleaning up our used plates and coming around checking how we were.  The one drawback was the check-in process.  It did seem abnormally confusing at first for them to coordinate our large party (12) and check all our cards and get our headcount ...multiple times...before they were confident to seat us.  But once seated it ran pretty smoothly.  My 4 stars is based on speed, quantity and value more than overall 'quality', but it's a buffet in old Vegas, and for a buffet, there were more stars than duds in the offerings presented."}
{"text":"FEAST. There's something so wonderful and over-the-top about that word, it's just very enjoyable to say.  I think this buffet is pretty standard for Vegas buffet fare, but if you're on this side of Vegas I'm not sure there are a lot of similar choices around. It was reasonably priced when we came here for dinner one night and there are plenty of options for different types of food for you to enjoy. I don't think anything in particular stood out, but it wasn't a mediocre meal either. I would say I probably enjoyed it more than the different Station buffets I've been to.  I would definitely consider going back if ever in the area again."}
{"text":"best of the station casino buffets.  check out the desserts at the front of the cafe, if you just want a rad quick sweet for 2$"}
{"text":"sometimes you just have to try everything on the menu   the santa fe station is head and shoulders the best of the stations buffets"}
{"text":"Out of all the buffets I have been to since moving to Las Vegas over 2 years ago, so far this one is the best. The line is usually long to get in if you come during dinner time. But it was worth the wait. Now we know to come during an off hour. The selection was huge and all the food looked fresh and tasted great. Service was okay. Took a while to get our drinks refilled. But we will be back because of the big selection and the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This buffet would have gotten 3-stars if it weren't for the price. After you've eaten at most local buffets, you expect the normal food you'ld get for a buffet.  Before, this used to cost around $12 but now, you can find deals like $5. So I'm not one to complain, especially since it's close to where I live. Can't review anything about the service, it's get your drink, refill, and be on your way. It's ok I guess."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all! The food was ehhh. I've had sooo much better. If you want an average buffet- it's ok. We were there on a Monday at 5 and there was no line- that was probably the best part of the whole experience. And our waitress was good- she kept our drinks full and got us coffee when we requested it.  My opinion....walk over to the Cafe or Fatburger in the food court."}
{"text":"Best buffet in town with American and International serving stations, salads, soups, and desserts. Great value. Drinks included. Sign up for a Station Casino boarding pass and save more on your meal. Served breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Enjoy a wonderful time there with your family and friends."}
{"text":"Whatever you want to call it, the crap they serve here is not fit for human consumption. Mark this as 0 stars. I came here with a coupon...even with the savings, it's not worth it. Drink server stopped by once, no refills offered and she stood and talked with another server for five minutes doing nothing else. I did not expect much to start, so with that said, whatever you can imagine as bad food, this will be it. Pancakes tasted like the batter was made of cardboard. Bacon was served only partly cooked with parts that were raw. Truly, I was disgusted eating here."}
{"text":"Pretty enjoyable breakfast buffet we had at the Red Rock casino. It had a lot of choices for breakfast and it was rather reasonably priced. We came back here the next year and tried the lunch buffet which was equally good."}
{"text":"None of the food is great but some of it is OK.   And their prices keep climbing, although they are still one of the cheaper ones unless you go on those special nights.  The food is bland and I don't know why this place is packed so often.  I went again today, knowing better, but I haven't been here in a year and I'm having trouble believing that something is seriously wrong with their food, but there is -- not just the bland taste and the poor, very limited selection.  Every time I eat at a buffet at any Station Casino, I get nearly instant diarrhea.   I mean, my stomach starts rumbling just minutes after I eat.  If I get a second plate, I'm never able to finish because I'm already on my way to the toilet.  Ka-whoosh...  instant, liquid diarrhea every single time.  This happens at any Station Casino buffet at also at Sam's Town Firelight buffet (although it doesn't hit me nearly as quick at Sam's Town).  This does NOT happen anywhere else... no other restaurant, no other buffet, not even with Fast Food.  I could eat McDonald's and Wendy's every single day and not have any stomach problems... but as soon as I eat the food from Station Casinos, I'm rumbling and running to the toilet.   As I said, I tried staying away for nearly a year... not a single problem anywhere else.  I go back once and it happens again.   I've tried eating a totally different selection of foods and that doesn't seem to make a difference.  What are they doing to the food?  What are they adding to cause this disgusting problem?   And I feel horrible for the next few hours, going to the toilet sometimes five or six times...  with the same type of stuff coming out of me."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good buffet for breakfast. I haven't eaten in the buffet for other meals. They have a pretty good variety of items. The only thing that I don't like is they only have ham in the morning at the carving station and sometimes it's full of fat and grease! They don't bother to trim the fat off either, but just carve and plop it on your plate. Then the grease just swims on your plate! Who wants to put other items on the plate with that? They should give you a choice, especially on a weekend, in my mind. Other than that, you have your choice of beverages, including champagne and other alcoholic beverages for a bit extra. It's a good place to take the family when they're visiting, as everyone can choose what they want to eat for one price. Only 3 stars for fatty and greasy ham with no variety ever."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude wait staff.  (2 of them)  Miserable experience.  I paid at the cashier desk and walked in, got breakfast at the buffet, and sat at a table.  A waiter immediately scolded me: \"You're sitting here???\"  Me:  Well, yes?  He:  \"Where's your ticket?\" (Said with hostility and suspicion.)   When I showed it to him he looked at it with suspicion, searching it as if it were a forged document.  Then he begrudgingly asked if I wanted anything to drink while adding how I \"was supposed to place my ticket on the table.\"  When he left I told a waitress how rude he was and she had an attitude as well!  She kept saying \"Well you have to wait to be seated.\"  I told her how would I know that?  There was nobody there and no sign.  She rudely responded that there is a sign and she's \"just telling me the rules.\"  No she wasn't.  She was scolding me as her coworker was.  I have never been treated like that anywhere.  Incredibly rude.  I spoke to the manager (nice lady) and then spoke to the manager of the hotel (another nice lady), but those two waiters were very rude.  The man especially.    The hotel is gorgeous but my first morning here has been ruined by that experience."}
{"text":"Came here because my group was indecisive about what to have for dinner, so what better way to please everyone then to go to a buffet. This one is like any other local casino low key buffet. Food was good and it filled my belly, but nothing spectacular.   Pros:  -No wait at all for dinner on a Saturday night -Good variety: BBQ, Carving station, Mexican, Asian, Italian, Gelato -Cheap! Get an aliante card and earn yourself some discounts  Cons: -Quality was medicore -Some of the food had the appearance of sitting out too long"}
{"text":"I am a fan -- because I've been to this buffet multiple times and it is always good. I was here for the $20 Thanksgiving buffet - all you can eat turkey, ham, roast beef - you name it, they had it. On Turkey Day the line was very, very long - and there was a drunk lady in front of us that kept sloshing around and bumping into us and others but other than that the wait wasn't too bad at about 45 minutes. This place is so far from the strip I would hope to be mingling with locals only, I don't know why but to have a drunken tourist was odd, but it was. I'll be back to eat at this buffet again."}
{"text":"Mediocre food... Seriously. Nothing much to say here. I tried out a Station Casino buffet again after a 5 year boycott due to finding a feather in my fried chicken. The Resteraunt was clean and the server was nice. My husband enjoyed it and it just filled me up. That's about it. I'd go back if I had to but I wouldn't choose to est here."}
{"text":"$7.99 with a players card.  Hamburgers made to order are okay. Roast beef carving station not enough to justify regular price of 10.99. Main St. Better value."}
{"text":"We came here twice during our 2 day stay...yes...twice. $7.99 for breakfast and $20 for a meat filled dinner. They have these different stations where you can go and eat and stare and then eat some more.   The quality of their food: good. some stuff was great-like their strawberry ice cream..and I don't even like ice cream all that much.   What impressed me the most is their big assortment of dessert. They've got everything from red velvet cupcakes, pistachio ice cream, and sweet potato pie to name a few.   When we went to this buffet we must have come at the right time because when we left there was a big line just to get in.   I don't know how those peoples experience went but for us...we were seated quickly, our drinks got refilled rather slowly but surely and we left very very full."}
{"text":"The food is very inconsistent when it comes to quality. The  orange chicken, fried rice, and cheesecake was pretty good. The lemonade is super sugary, overall, everything ive eaten has resulted in a stomachache.  The service was great, very friendly,  but untill the quality is better I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Must try buffet ... Everything but everything is delicious.. I went for brunch.. Will be going back for dinner someday soon . Price not to bad . Me n my hubby paid almost $30 including tip ... The line to get in took me about 10 mins maybe a little more .. Definitely worth the wait . Hope when u go u enjoy it too"}
{"text":"My husband and I went this Sunday, to our surprise EVERYTHING we tasted was good. Fresh and with flavor. I think the Sunday chef does a great job. Other days have been lacking some flavor. But today was great. Our waitress left us for dead, dice she gave us our drinks she never came back. I had to ask walking by waitresses for refills and high chair. But it really didn't take away from my husband and I enjoying the food to the max."}
{"text":"My husband and I just reminded ourselves why we stopped going to this buffet last weekend.  We got there just at 4pm on Saturday afternoon and wanted the regular dinner buffet at $10.99 but were told as their special was the Shrimp & Prime Rib at $13.99 we HAD to pay for that.  We didn't really want it but didn't say anything as it should be OK - right?  NOT.  The prime rib was so wafer thin you could almost see thru it and when I asked for a thicker slice was told they were not allowed to cut anything thicker.  When I went to get the peel and eat shrimp from the COLD buffet they only had HOT plates - come on guys - this is the basics here!!  They even had hot plates to put salad on!!  When we were in the line waiting to pay there were FOUR employees just hanging around at the other cashier station looking at us  - you think they could have opened and helped out?  Service overall was slow and they really couldn't care less.  The rest of the buffet was just nasty and it all tasted the same - stodge, stodge and more stodge - really sorry for what used to be a pretty OK buffet for locals."}
{"text":"Tonight...We Dine! No, Tonight...We eat! No, Tonight...We Feast!!!! Yes, Feast Buffet located within the Sunset Station Hotel Casino. Already threw down a review on Sunset Station, so here's they're buffet. You must sign up for they're players club for it will save you a couple bucks, but with that said, there's no need to! This buffet is huge, clean, and gorgeous. Complete typical Vegas style buffet, the price is unbelievable, I will have to try and nice dinner buffet here soon, with that said I've been here twice, once for breakfast and the other lunch. There's a plethora of food to choose from, all the international cuisine they can offer, as you'll see from the photos I post you can see how much food you can grab, full salad bar, soups, fresh carving station with Ham, Polish Sausage, and turkey. They have Mexican,Chinese, Italian, and American. Everything you can think of is out, and it tastes good. Trust me you CAN NOT ARGUE the price for what your getting, you want to pay for Caesars Palace Buffet, yes, you will find more selection I'm sure like shrimp, oysters, but trust me, this buffet is definitely worth 4/5 stars, you will not be disappointed. Time to Feast, hopefully some of you on this review."}
{"text":"Service + Restaurant Interior: 4/5 Price vs. Quantity: 5/5 Food Taste: 5/5  This buffet is definitely tied for the best buffet I've been to. The price is very reasonable for all you can eat. I suggest you get the players card which is free and knocks a couple of dollars off the buffet for you. With the players card this buffet becomes one of the cheapest buffets that rivals the quality of many of the strip buffets. The only place is clean and well kept, I never get that dirty feeling eating the food that I sometimes do at cheap buffets and the dining area is very pretty. Service is usually a tad slow with drink orders, but that's not the end of the world to me. Keep doing you, Red Rock.  I've tried both brunch and dinner buffets here and both are fantastic. The brunch buffets serve all of your typical breakfast items such a waffles, french toast, and pancakes. The pancakes are a little lackluster, but the waffles and french toast are great. Their bacon is delicious here, perfectly cooked where it's crispy but not overcooked and salty. Scrambled eggs were fluffy and the corned beef hash was delicious. Blintzes and benedicts were decent. Overall I got my fill with the breakfast items and was more than satisfied. Many of the other lunch items I tried I'll cover for the dinner portion.  The dinner, surprisingly, is my favored meal at this buffet and that's rare because breakfast always wins for me. Their Asian food is pretty tasty. General Tso's chicken with a tasty not overly sweet flavor. Their Chinese vegetables are fresh and have a nice light flavor. Pot stickers were good and so was the wonton soup.   The comfort food is where I'm at though. Mashed sweet potato (so good!), meat loaf (my favorite thing here), stuffing, and the fried shrimp. Dear lord was that good. It just hit every note I wanted it to. The meat loaf has a good flavor (almost like something a mom would make for dinner), the stuffing was delicious and just slightly dry, the fried shrimp was perfectly crunchy and with some cocktail sauce is great. Top the meatloaf and stuffing off with a little bit of gravy and put some cranberry sauce on the side; you've got yourself a plate full of comfort.   Special shout out to the fried fish which was crunchy and tasty and went well with the tartar sauce provided. Their pizza, excellent. Probably the second best buffet pizza I've had and the buffalo chicken one opened up my eyes to a new pizza topping. They have a little vegetarian nook that has varying veggie burgers and curries (spinach and chickpea curry, yum).  The dessert area, while not fancy like Bacchanal, has a lot of options including cookies, any pie you can think of, donuts, cakes, gelato, bread pudding, and I think I saw a chocolate lava cake once. My personal favorite are the donuts, one of which is a small typical looking pink frosted donut (the type with a whole in the middle) that was filled with jelly throughout the ring."}
{"text":"SHAKING MY HEAD.  So im kind of excited they got this 2 for 1 buffet promotion til the end of February. Of course you gotta have a player card to qualify for it. Since they are no longer a Station Casino, they trying to promote the heck out of their own namesake. So I take my fam and friends for a total party of 8. We get 4 player cards to take full advantage of the offer.   Its  friday, which is steak night and the line for the entrance is HELLA long. So we wait. After about 30 minutes later we sit. Im going straight for the steak and beef ribs!  Like a drunk dude tryin to skate up an icy hill, it's all fails from this point on. I get beef ribs, ribeye steak, sirloin steak, corn on the cob, and mashed potatoes.  1. The beef ribs were dry and very skimpy. I literally had to dump spicy barbeque sauce on them just to get any kind of flavor besides the smoke flavoring.   2. The ribeye steak was well done. Now, if you like steak flavored gum, this piece of rubber is for you!  3. The sirloin steak was the ribeye's evil twin brother. Nuff said.  Based off of what I just ate, I was afraid to even look at the corn on the cob and mashed potatoes. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised. The corn was actually sweet and rather juicy. The mashed poatoes were tasty and the texture was consistant all through out. If you think about it, that's pretty sad if the sides are what is noteworthy.  So I get up to see if there is anything else decent that can satisfy my hunger. As I go to grab a plate, another fail presents itself. I see some people just standing there looking around. Turns out, there were no more plates. Say what? Another unexcusable fail. What restaurant runs out of clean plates? Better yet, a buffet even?   So to end my evening I decided to get salad since they had the small plates available for that. YES, I SAID SALAD! With this move I am totally contradicting myself by making fun of people who go to buffets just to eat salad. THIS IS THE LAST FAIL!  So in closing, I don't ever remember encountering so many fails at any kind of establishment. Dont get me wrong. I know I should be appreciative of the 2 for 1 promo which I was, but the fails were just too much. So for those of you that are reading this and just now got in line, DONT DO IT!"}
{"text":"OK, so the only reason I gave this place 5 stars is because of the value for the  price! I don't know how they do it for such a low price (the highest one is obviously dinner, and it's like under $10 with a players card, and if you don't have one, they have someone on standby who will issue one in like 3 mins AND you don't lose your place in line) Food is about 4.5 stars, and really is great, don't get me wrong. During breakfast, you will find plain pancakes, cookies and cream pancakes, AND chocolate chip pancakes! My son and I go to Vegas about 4 times a year, and we have tried other buffets.  Now we just automatically just come here.  One of the reasons why?  Some places, after you eat, for the rest of the day, you are super thirsty and keep drinking gallons of water.   Now I'm assuming it's due to the salt content/msg use.  Either way, hate hate hate that feeling.  Never get that here. The staff is so darn friendly, from the cashiers to the hostesses to the waitresses! Yeah, I read one review below of a waiter who bailed without saying anything, so I suggest you request a female waitress, cause so far that has not happened to me. You will find a little bit of everything here!"}
{"text":"The first time I went here was way back when this place first opened...I remember eating the food here, and saying it was the best buffet food I've ever had...  We came here for Christmas lunch for the first time since I was last here... and that whole perspective of \"this place has the best buffet food\" has changed...what happened? Out of all the \"little bit of everythings\" that I had on my plate, there were probably one or two things that I actually enjoyed eating...1) the prime rib which was super juicy and flavorful, 2) the crispy pork belly with cabbage...everything else just blah/nothing memorable about it...  On a much lighter side note, this buffet is probably one of the better buffets that serve delicious desserts...not the best, but certainly very, very good for a buffet...heck, my whole meal should have just been nothing but desserts...they were better than the actual cold/hot foods haha...the red velvet mini cupcakes were very good, as well as the brownie a la mode, cannoli, and choco chip cookies...I would have liked to sample more of the desserts but I was already heading towards a food coma hahaha...  The ambience is nice, very spacious, and a large selection of food...the wait to get in is ridiculous...we waited about an 1.5 hours in line...not sure how much we paid, but typical buffet prices have gone up as much as $35+ now...then again it's Vegas...expect it to be like that even when it's not a holiday..."}
{"text":"A good buffet. Not thee best I've ever been to but good nonetheless. I went for a wedding reception (there were about 3 wedding parties going on), so I have no idea what the price was.   The place itself is nice. Maybe because it's not located directly off the strip.   The food was your typical buffet food ranging from american to italian, mexican to chinese. They also have a sushi bar and a gelato bar!  I probably won't be back, just because I usually stay on the strip..but it was nice to try something new."}
{"text":"Something wonderful about that $7-8 Breakfast Buffet they offer!  I really enjoy Feast Buffet, its such a great alternative to picking up fast food in a hurry! I can get a personal made omelette with super healthy veggies, egg whites and protein as well as an additional bar with salads, yogurt and granola. If I am feeling not so healthy, I can order hash browns, French toast, pancakes, waffles and chicken, grits and bacon all things breakfast.  You can't beat the options at this buffet as well as the price, nothing sounds better to me than someone else cooking and the price is magical.  Don't forget your drink options, you can have one of everything! Orange Juice, Coffee, Cranberry Juice its all available. As A Local, I like to rent a cabana at the pool for $75.00 and just enjoy the day after breakfast!"}
{"text":"My family and I wanted to eat buffet. But ever other buffet on the strip was crowded and the wait is like 3 hrs. So we decided to just come here because we knew it was going to be cheap. The food was okie I feel... There was t a lot of choices and options. Not like other buffets. But at 12.99 with players card what do you expect? Frozen margaritas are only $2! But you can hardly taste the alcohol. Tasted just like a slushy. Haha overall, wait was only 15 mins, food was decent, and service was good."}
{"text":"The buffet is half the price as those on the strip and twice as good.   The food variety and quality is better than one would expect.   The waiters are excellent.  If you are in Las Vegas and want to get away from the Strip for a little while this is a great place to come to"}
{"text":"Well the sugar free jello is tasty . We don't eat bread or pasta so our selection was ridiculously limited. Overall for $10 each in a Friday night with your card this is a good value."}
{"text":"For a upper scale pricing hotel/casino you would assume the buffet would be good. Not the case here. Service was horrible, I mean bad even for a buffet. Food decent however the placement of the food did not make sense. Only positive was the wait was not long at all."}
{"text":"I am a 100% Disabled Veteran and retired from the U.S. Army. Today my son and I waited in the handicap line at the feast buffet and paid for our meals. The hostess came up and took us to our seats and placed us in the furthest table from the buffet line. I just wanted to let some disabled customers know that you will probably have to speak up if you want to be seated closer to the buffet line. I don't think the handicap line you wait in is a indication to the hostesses."}
{"text":"Only two cashiers today, even though it was Memorial Day and the line was long. Had to ask the server (José) three times for extra napkins. Had to ask the same server for a refill on sodas another three times even though my friend and I had empty glasses for a while. Times have definitely changed, because when I was growing up, the server refilled your glasses as soon as they were half empty. Food was okay, but my friend (who was celebrating her birthday as well as Military Appreciation Day) didn't see why they raised the price of the buffet. One star but only because I can't give zero..."}
{"text":"Easily one of my worst dining experiences ever. First of all, how long does it take to get your first drink when the buffet is less than 25% full? About 20 minutes apparently. Secondly, most of the food trays were empty or close to empty. Again, there weren't many people eating (which was a surprise considering it was 12:30), but still. Thirdly, there were plenty of tables with dirty dishes stacked up on them. Yuck. Finally, I had to wait about 15 minutes for my drink to be refilled. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed with anything here. I'd give this place zero stars if I could but Yelp won't let me..."}
{"text":"The \"5 Stars\" is a legitimate rating if you keep this buffet in context with similar buffets... The haters who give it a low rating because they compare it to the high end $35-$50 and up buffets are MISLEADING other Yelp-ers! I gave it 5 Stars because for a $7.99 dinner price buffet (If you go over and get the FREE Station Rewards Card-- which you SHOULD/MUST), it exceeded my expectations in these areas:  1) Variety of Food: For Sat. Night dinner, it has an Asian Station, a Mexican Taco Station, a Carving Station with beef, turkey, sausage, a made to order pasta station, salad stations on both sides, comfort foods throughout, (pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, etc.), a HUGE dessert station with tons of choices, and a soft-serve machine that also dispenses sorbet. 2) Quality and Tastiness of Food: Next to the pasta station, the pre-made penne was crazy yummy, the Mac 'n cheese was delicious, the grilled fish was terrific, the popcorn shrimp was great, the three kinds of soups were tasty, the fried chicken was fresh and hot. The desserts, especially the pies, were also terrific (SO MANY choices!) 3) The Decor/Service/Wait Time. We arrived on a holiday weekend Saturday at peak dinner time window with very little wait time, and choice of booth or table. The cashiers, hostesses, and our server, Sonia, were all very professional. The decor and tables were lovely. 4) Value - This is where the 5 Stars was really earned! It's a $7.99 buffet, folks! Remember when MOST LV buffets were this ridiculously inexpensive? This is a last of a dying breed... And so very worth it! Look to your right, it's a one \"$\" for the price point, but not for its quality and amenities. Come here if you want the budget, you're gonna get way more than you paid for experience. Go elsewhere if you want the decadent, overwhelming, (overpriced) Vegas buffet experience. This is an awesome \"Best Cheap Las Vegas Buffet\" experience!"}
{"text":"This buffet is not very good.  Cheap cafeteria food with no flavor. Don't waste your money. Go somewhere that takes an interest in a delicious meal for a good price. That's not this place.  NOT DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"It's an okay spot to eat. Sometimes you get some undercooked or overcooked food, which isn't overly nice. It's a decent place to eat on a budget.  For dinner, there happens to be quite a bit of fish. Of you're not a fish lover like my mom, then I'd come for lunch! Worth at least one trip."}
{"text":"This locals hang out was even better than usual today.  Always one of the better buffets left in Vegas at the price point.  Trafficked by a ton of locals who know \"what's up\".   Very inexpensive compared to most other high end buffets.   Extra discounts with players cards make it darn cheap esp for lunch!  Today was amazing. The new beef stew offering is just \"stop the presses\" type delicious.   The ingredient qualities of the various dishes I had today were great and super fresh.   Chinese broccoli was perfectly prepared, and the chicken at the carving station was super moist and very flavorful.   Best buffet i have ever enjoyed at red rock- not sure if there have been any staff or supplier changes, but this was fabulous today!!!!!  And the cherry on top was lunch at 12:30 had no line today!   Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We actually found out about this place through Buzzfeed's WorthIt series and wanted to try it out! I wish we made it here a little earlier so that we could have tried their breakfast items, but this review is mainly for their lunch items!   We were rang up before 11am which meant our bill was about $50 for 4 people - aka $11.99 per person!!! An amazing price for an AYCE buffet! We didn't get seated until around 10:55 and by that time, all the breakfast stuff was getting taken out and lunch stuff was being moved in.   The food is pretty decent for $12 a person and we were pretty full for the rest of the day! This is like your typical buffet with a variety of food and also a carving station. They also have gelato which was really neat!   Overall I want to come back for their actual breakfast to try it out! Our server Miguel was the sweetest and we loved him! He was kind and quick and we hope to see him next time!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my Favorite Buffets because of the many options. All the Food choices are great. They have something for everyone, located inside the beautiful Red Rock Casino. This Hotel is Family and Kids oriented because they have an Arcade, Kids Zone and Bowling Alley."}
{"text":"Lots of choice for the price. We went around 1pm for lunch. They still had plenty of breakfast items available including stations for making your own omelettes and delicious ham stations. Mimosas and champagne was included in the buffet so we ordered a round before our waitress suggested a cranberry version of the mimosa, which I enjoyed better. It's hard to flag down the waitress for drinks but otherwise the buffet was decent. Only waited 20 minutes in line."}
{"text":"Awful for lunch 1 star for lunch, its basically dog food lol Breakfast is the only time to go 5 stars for breakfast ! So they get 3 stars total because staff is nice but make sure you leave them a tip I see people stiffing them a lot ! Even though it's a buffet they make money on tips doesn't have to be like a waiter at a restaurant where u give 20% but we always try to leave a couple dollars a person because they do bring your drinks and clean after you so don't be rude. We saw a group of 6 leave a messy table with no tip for the lady to clean after they left I could see her silently frustrated/sad please leave something for them especially if you're a larger group!"}
{"text":"Called the Feast buffet earlier they suggested to get the \"Station Casinos\" Rewards card to get additional discounts on the buffet. We did that and the weekday lunch buffet was $10 instead of regular $15 per person.   Went to Feast Buffet at Green Valley location for Monday lunch buffet. Parking was free and it plenty of spots were there.   Casino staff were super friendly and when asked for directions instead of just showing directions they walked us there itself. That was really nice gesture.   Went around 2pm on Monday. Just 6 families in front of us in the line. We were seated in less than 5 minutes and within seconds the waiter came to our table and took our drinks order too.    There were seven different food sections: Chinese , Mongolian grill, International (Spanish ), American, Italian, Salads & Desserts.  All the food were tasty.  For seafood they had Bass  which was awesome and some other fish in Chinese section. They smoked bean was also very tasty. Most of the items we tried were amazing.   Will definitely go to Feast Buffet again. Worth the visit."}
{"text":"We were trying to get in for the breakfast buffet but standing in line for 20 minutes made us have to pay for the lunch buffet.  They should really have someone at the end of the line hold a tag so that everyone before him at 11:00 would get charged the breakfast and not the lunch since it wasn't the peoples fault for having to wait in line to be processed.  That would have been more fair.  The food was average and used more for convenience than anything else.  The salad bar was the way to go here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite buffets in Vegas and also at one of my favorite casino's!     The Feast Buffet has a little bit of everything.  Japanese, Italian , Chinese, American.  I love the pizza, the sushi, the shrimp and linguini freshly made to order.  The salad bar is loaded too. Love the Caesar dressing!    The dessert bar amazing!   There are tons of no sugar added items for those watching they're sugar levels.   Or like me...guilt free eating!  Try a piece of everything!!!   This is definitely a buffet stop to put on your itinerary.  You'll love it just as much as the casino!"}
{"text":"This buffet is decent but definitely not as good as the buffet at red rock; however, the sunset station feast buffet dinner is slight cheaper compared to red rock and the line is a lot shorter. Dinner is only 9.95 (with station casino boarding pass) at sunset while red rock charges 12.95 for their dinner buffet.  Food is quite similar to the red rock one. I noticed they don't offer any sushi here though. But they have the regular stuff like roast chicken, same chinese stir fry dishes, pizzas, pasta, desserts. The dessert selection is pretty good. My favorite is always the canoli and carrot cake. If you don't care for sushi, this buffet is definitely a more budget-friendly choice."}
{"text":"Let me start with turn around, press back, just stop reading and forget about this establishment  Where do I start. Be prepared to wait for no reason. We waited like 20 minutes and half the tables inside were empty. None of the food was fresh. We got attitude from everyone that worked there, I'm sorry your employed at a hotel and make a decent wage and I just paid an ungodly amount for what we didn't know was the worst food on the planet.   The \"carving\" station was a chore for the two gentlemen whose only job was to slice meat. They didn't have anything else to do but slice the meat but to get that steak that you paid so much for you must find like the golden ticket for their attention. I stared the dude straight in the face for 5 minutes saying steak. At first very pleasantly but after 5 minutes not very nice. He was either staring at this 9 year old girl or this dude with a Mohawk. I really hope it was the hair.   I couldn't eat Anything here. I spat everything out. Everything was either extremely greasy, extremely sweet or just plain smelled rotten. Not to mention I had a table next to me where the dad of three kids was yelling at his kids that they did not eat enough for the money he spent. Obviously they could also realize the poor quality in good.   For the price of a meal here and even as a member of the total rewards 17.99 could get you some amazing food in this resort, why compromise that.   The biggest issue I had is the one thing I was looking forward to (dessert) was such a let down. The only thing I wanted was the creme brûlée and I figured I'd be safe to eat real food and then grab one at the end and everything will be fine. The baker who could not speak English well or just played dumb was like oh we're not making anything new. I was like I paid 20 bucks and I can't even enjoy my dessert went to the front and the whole front staff is gone. Over it. Now I'm at home puking. Have a great night folks."}
{"text":"The Good : The server, no line,  price, and the pizza  The Bad : Everything else. Just about everything thing I tried except for the pizza was old, cold or stale. I used to come here a lot back in the day when they had pork chops and good options.. now its all garbage food like hot dogs and mac and cheese. Not coming back ever again."}
{"text":"The service here is very mediocre. so is the food. The only good thing about this buffet is the price its a lot cheaper than the buffets on the strip, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Mike and I stopped here for a cheap and good breakfast on the way to the strip. The corn beef hash was definitely some of the best I've ever had and donuts are always good. It was spacious, had lots of items, and wasn't crowded. Will have to put this on the come back list."}
{"text":"I don't know how dinner is but lunch was pretty bad. The only redeeming factor was that it was cheap. That being said, I essentially paid 8.99 for a bowl of soup because that was the only thing I found edible. It was a sad experience."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes to get seated. The people that jumped the president line from my line were served first when they clearly were not VIP.  Then I get seated right in front of the server kitchen area. I was like \" can I get that seat over there instead?  \" the waitress said it was taken. Now an hour later no one ever sat at that table?? Wtf?  Anyway I get up to get my second round of tasting this time the BBQ section and no plates to be found!  I had to walk all the way down to the Mexican section to grab one which I think is ridiculous!  And i never got asked if I wanted a refill on my drink!"}
{"text":"When visiting my Dad in town, we came here for the first time with him. It was pretty decent, plenty of things to choose from all around the world. Which is great because my boyfriend likes all kinds of different foods that I don't always cook for him, like seafood... uh hmmm.. don't judge me..   Anyways, we came here I don't remember our total for food on how much it was but I know we were all stuffed afterwards and the plates were full and did not get to all that was on them.  You can head to the salad bar, the dessert area, get some meatloaf, fried chicken, pasta, or pizza, pretty much anything you are in the mood for."}
{"text":"I went there this morning and the food was decent.  The bacon was good, the mini chicken fried steak also was good but the gravy was pretty much cold.  The eggs also were cold but the sausage was warm.  One drawback for those that use wi-fi when available is the Feast now has the wi-fi disabled until you leave the dining area.  I did ask the people at the Station pass desk and they said managment made the decision but didn't tell them why.  And now it's $7.99 for breakfast even though their menu board says $6.99, so not a good deal since lunch is a dollar more."}
{"text":"I really wish I took plenty of mouth watering picture of this place cause this buffet is amazing. Don't get me wrong it is not the best buffet in Vegas, but it was cheap and delicious so why not rave about it. For only $6.99 for brunch and their choices of food are pulled pork, baked salmon, kielbasa, freaking STEAK!! (seriously for only $6.99) you already know what I'm going with this. Lastly, don't forget to munch down those desserts; they have a wide selection of it so pig out! This is what is all about! Going back here for sure :)"}
{"text":"We ate here for the breakfast buffet on 4/25/2016  We paid about $20 for my wife and I.  We didn't have a casino rewards card or else it would've been $1-2 off each person.  The filipino cashier (I know he's filipino cuz I am filipino) asked if I wanted someone to come to us so they can make us a card.  I declined yet was amazed on his customer service when he offered this to us.  The hostess who sat us asked how we were doing.  I asked her how she was doing and she looked at me and laughed as if she was was having a bad day.  She could've lied. The buffet had everything I expected and was surprised to see that they had menudo.  The only thing missing was the fixings' for this mexican soup.  That was a total bummer. Slabs of bacon, sausage and ham were the norm.  Pancakes, waffles, french toast and the omelette station were also avail.  Donuts, pastries...blah, blah, blah.  Everything else was great, especially since the price was right even without the rewards card.  I would recommend eating here to everyone.  Though, we only ate here once during our week here because we wanted to try other places."}
{"text":"One of my biggest gripes about some reviews is that they expect something magical for a low cost. Is that possible? Absolutely. However, don't go to certain places, like the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station expecting the same experience you would have at The Wynn. It costs $9 on Sunday for brunch my friends. The Wynn costs about $40. You do the math.  However, even though this place is not one of those magical cheap eats spots, it is still great. The service never disappoints. The service I've received is friendly and they'll even talk to you when you're sitting there shoving food into your mouth by yourself. Yes, I go to buffets by myself. I am a closet Fatty McBuffetington. Shhh.  The variety is decent here as well! Asian station, Omelettes made to order, carving station, breakfast station, Mexican food section and then dessert. I contacted Sunset before going to the buffet and discussed what I could and could not eat since I am gluten free. Obviously, you have to be careful eating at a buffet being gluten free because they cannot promise anything. Since I have been there a few times and know some of the chefs (this just keeps getting more pathetic as I go), they make me Eggs Benedict without the English Muffin. Oh, I could swim in that hollandaise sauce. They always cook the eggs PERFECTLY.   Let's move onto the carving station. Oh prime rib and ham.I love their carving station. Prime rib is normally cooked rare with some parts slightly more medium. If you do not like it rare, they will slap it on the grill for you, but please note that a little part of my soul dies whenever someone takes beef and cooks it anything more than medium rare. The ham is straight off the bone, flavorful, and nice and tender. Yum-O.  I do not add lots of carbohydrates onto my plate. However, sometimes they have cheesy potatoes and they compliment both the prime rib and the ham quite well.  The mashed potatoes lack flavor, but if you are a little creative, run over to the salad bar, add a little sour cream or a little cream cheese, some green onion (or other green savory veggie) and then sprinkle on some bacon and a little cheddar cheese. Loaded mashed potatoes for the win. Add a little red pepper flake from the pizza station.   Speaking of the other stations, let's talk about non gluten free food. I've been to this buffet with friends and family, and they have tried almost everything else at that buffet. The fried rice? Terrible. It happens. The orange chicken is mediocre at best, but maybe its better if you get it right when it comes out of the fryer. Noodles, standard, nothing wild but okay. Beef and broccoli, pretty great.   The Mexican food station is also quite decent. Obviously, nothing is as good as the real thing, and I really do despise that they use flour tortillas (dull flavor and they are not gluten free), but hey, it works! I have definitely smothered my egg white or whole egg omelet with some guacamole or pico de gallo to add a little extra flavor. The juevos rancheros normally are one of the few things I've seen left on the plate, but the quesadillas and enchiladas are good for a a buffet.  Oh the pizza. I'm a pizza snob, and I know it. I come from Chicago which is a city that loves their pies, so I've had everyone try the pizza out here. Compared to some of the mom and pop pizza joints out here (most of them to be quite honest), Sunset does their pizza right. They have a few different choices, stuffed pizza and oh yes, garlic breadsticks which I have seen devoured in mass amounts. Slather some marinara sauce on those suckers and give Olive Garden a run for its money! Speaking of Olive Garden, I have also heard the pasta is pretty good there! Same with the rest of the Italian food station which has Chicken Marsala, one of my favorite dishes in this whole wide world. They didn't know if it was gluten free, so I did not try it. However, I will ask next time. I'm salivating just thinking about it.  So when you go to there for any meal, remember that this is not the strip, this is not the Wynn or the Bellagio, and take everything you eat with a grain of salt. Literally. Enjoy your pretty freaking delicious $5, $7 or $9 meal, leave a tip, and go home with your swollen buffet happy and content. If you want something that is a little finer dinner fare, go to Green Valley Ranch. I'll be there next weekend with my buffet-loving Dad, making every workout necessary this week."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner.... Not THE Best, but with the rewards card, it's a $8 dinner. Lets face it -- for $8 you can get a horrible meal elsewhere that will leave you half satisfied. But here, you can at least pick and choose your fill.  Additionally, if you're on a budget and don't feel like forking over $30-40 for a dinner buffet on the strip... Here you go.   Salad bar is great! Full.  Pasta.... Has been sitting under the heat lamp for too long. Hard. Brittle. It's a problem for me as I have braces. I thought the wires were gonna be pulled out of my mouth! Chow mein is limp. Collared greens are so salty!! Are they supposed to be this way?!  Dessert bar: OMG THE BANANA CREAM PIE IS GOOD! :) haha."}
{"text":"Be sure to stop by the rewards center to get your casino Rewards card so that you'll get the discounted advertised price (bfast $4.99, lunch 7.99, dinner $9.99). Otherwise regular prices will apply, I think they're $3-4 more. Cheap, quality and selecton is not top notch but still a bit ok, equivalent to buffet at Circus Circus. A lot of locals here, esp folks over 50.. Breakfast is definitely so much better than lunch! I rather eat lunch at Panda Express. Yes, it's that bad. But breakfast... :) for $5? It's amazing! They make your eggs however you want, and they have all these delicious side things you can have!! It's so much more worth than $5 and the quality is just great!! :)"}
{"text":"I wouldn't suggest eating here, I had to wait over an hour to be seated before I could even get food. The staff is not friendly and even the manager walked away without acknowledging our concern of no communication on their part as to why our party of 12 is standing around watching numerous other large parties being seated one after another.   We never requested tables together and watched 4 hosts move 4 tables in front of us to a table that seats 12 and then back again to two separate tables.   The staff was arguing with one another, talking down to each other and throwing silverware and placemats hard onto their table while we waited.   Don't bring your personal life to work and actually do your damn job. There are 4 of you standing around talking while i ask how much longer and ignored by everyone one of them.   Im so pissed and hangry that no matter how good this food is I won't be back until they hire new staff and management."}
{"text":"We end up here more often than I care to admit in public forum. LOL For some reason, our friends, family and visitors love this buffet!  I have to be honest, I actually like it too. No it is not fancy, like some of the strip buffets, but it is a solid, fresh, buffet that has a great assortment of meats, some seafood, etc, like roast beef, ribs, gourmet sausages, shrimp, etc, etc. The better seafood is limited to the weekends, when they charge a bit more.   They have an awesome desert section, with cakes, pies, and a gigantic make your own sundae counter! Even a large sugar free selection.  Let's talk service...Even though it is a buffet, trust me you still want an efficient, friendly person taking care of your table!

{"text":"The funny thing with Buffets in Las Vegas, everyone swears their favorite is the best one EVER! Am I right LV Locals?! We have all heard this.   This was no exception, my friends convinced me that this one was hands down the best \"Stations Buffet\" of all of them. ahhhhhhh....No, Not really. It was fine. It was cheap, it was food, and we were hungry. Problem solved.  The service was really what shined here! From the front to the smiling waitress to the servers behind the lines. That made it nice, for sure!  Would I go back, sure. Is it the Buffet Nirvana? I have yet to find that. Sorry, I know you have your favorite too."}
{"text":"Food: Mediocre - very limited selection.  Feast is a misnomer.  The only reason you would eat at this buffet is if: 1) you've been nearly wiped-out at the tables 2) all the other eating options in the Hotel are closed and you can't leave the hotel.  I contemplated walking to other eateries across the street from the Hotel - I should have listened to me-self.  Service, however, was great.  Our servers was kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Did this buffet yesterday on Thanksgiving. Regret it all the way. Stood in line 5 hours. Arrived at 2; sat down at 7. I had to be insane to do that to begin with. It was the biggest CF ever. You stand waiting behind large parties of 6-15. So obviously, those take longer to seat. So here you are, a party of 2 waiting ridiculously long. Why not have 2 lines, one for parties of 4 or less, and one for 6 or more?? Makes perfect sense to me. You'd move things twice as fast.  Now to the food. There were only maybe 25% of the dishes that had signs on them!! You had no idea what the food was, and yes, some was a complete mystery. I'm sorry, but I don't want to take food I might take one bite of and decide I don't like it. There was no reason in the world not to have signage. Also, all of the food was mixed up from one station to the next. You would find cocktail sauce and horseradish in the middle of Thanksgiving food. It's as if they were just throwing stuff out there to fill holes. The service for water, champagne, sodas was extremely slow and tables sat dirty far too long. I don't think there is one good thing I can say about this disaster. STAY AWAY on holidays!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas, hands down. Without all of the hype, like the Rio Buffets, you don't have the crowd, like the Rio buffets... This time around I opted to have my crab legs & shrimp tossed on the griddle and the cook saute'd them in butter, garlic, cilantro, green onions & chili paste (tell them how spicy you want it). Frickin' delicious...check out the pics I uploaded. I even asked the carver to throw my slice on the grill...another good choice! It's off of the strip, so that might make sense of how cheap it is ($16.99 for dinner vs. $25+ at most other dinner buffets)   ***Oh and for the people that used to pay for the crab legs $5 / lb. NO MORE!!! That's right, They no longer charge for crab legs!!!***"}
{"text":"I was here last month with friends and the buffet was definitely a big improvement from some 2 years before, reason why I didn't come back because the Green Valley buffet was better. However, a date took me to Red Rock buffet last month and the food was delicious, definitely an upgrade. I liked it so much that my friends and I went to celebrate Valentine's day but we were so disappointed at the taste and selection of food. They didn't have the small fried fish, the macaroni & cheese was awful, most everything was below par compared to last month's. What I notice that this also happens at the Green Valley buffet, when there's an occasion, the quality deteriorates."}
{"text":"I ate here for brunch on Saturday and it was not crowded at all. It was off the strip so I as well lowered my expectations for this buffet. It was relatively inexpensive and good quality food but what really stood out was the customer service. It was above par and I was satisfied with my price to quality ratio. I felt like my money went far here as compared to the strip buffets. I would still rather prefer Wicked Spoon over this, but I have yet to try Feast Buffet for dinner."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointing this time.  Rice dried out, good sitting neath the hearing lamps a little too long and matt a bit dry.  Selection is still pretty decent but it does feel the quality dropped a notch.  Hopefully, better rotation of food to improve quality.  I hope mgmt will consider these reviews to improve."}
{"text":"One of the best-kept buffet secrets. A little costly than some but it is worth it. Make sure you try the grilled crab legs on Sunday"}
{"text":"The best food here is breakfast. The lunch and dinner are like nursing home food, bland and just plain gross.  The servers disappear for the longest time and getting a refill on a  drink is like pulling teeth. I would not be upset if I never ate here again."}
{"text":"My spam email address has the topic of loving crab in it. I love crab. This place has some of the BEST crab I've ever had in my life. This place is also only $20.99. They custom order your crab with all the best flavors of life in it. The next time I go to Vegas, I will rent a car just so I can drive to Henderson.  Oh yea, the table limits are low to."}
{"text":"Went here with Mom for lunch today.  (Been here a couple other times and this is the first time I'm reviewing it.)  Normally, I don't do Buffets. But this one is an exception. I hear the one at M is good too so I plan to try that one day too.  Anyways....  Waited about 20 minutes... we got there at like noon for a $6.99 lunch.  So, figures there'd be a wait.  For the price and considering it includes our soft drinks.... I gave this 4 stars for price, value and selection.  They don't have their crab or shrimp selections... but that's cuz it's $6.99.  But really enjoyed what they did have.  They have a nice selection of Italian, American, Mexican and Asian fare.  I did more Asian fare this time.  Mixed green salad with cranberries, pecans and blue cheese... YUM!  Went back for seconds.  Chef's salad - YUM!  It was a bit of mystery salad but then we found out the base was barley which I thought was different... it had chopped apples, cranberries, nuts, corn and all sorts of stuff in it... and the textures and taste really worked.  Who Knew!?  Chinese stir fry green beans - YUM!  a tad oily but not salty and not soggy.... it's a buffet ...I can't be overly picky, right  Eggroll - crispy on the outside, meaty with nice veggies on the inside  Tofu - light... what can I say... it's Tofu... and I don't normally eat it but thought I might as well try it.... it was in a light soy/sweet sauce and the tofu was a little too watery for my taste.. but it's probably supposed to be that way  Bok Choy - eh! wasn't impressed  Red Bean puff thing - it was pretty good... I didn't know what it was but I like to try everything once.  It was covered with sesames on the outside and looked like a mini donut... tasted like a mini donut too with what I assume was Red Bean paste on the inside because it was not sweet but more savory-like.  Asian Pork BBQ - dry... didn't go back for seconds  Seabass - not melt-in-your-mouth-Chilean-Seabass.... but still good nonetheless.... light and buttery  Mongolian BBQ - didn't try it but it looked really good... maybe next time  Pecan / Florentine like cookie/cake dessert - SO GOOD!  Chocolate covered Macaroon - Wow!  It was rich! You had better like coconut and ... one bit was all I needed to have my sweet tooth satisfied.  Tiramisu shooter - OK... it tasted more like vanilla pudding and the bread / cake part was tasteless."}
{"text":"Best Buffet in Vegas? This is the locals buffet, this is my go-to Mr. McOinky feed trough. Sushi isn't great, but it is ok. What gets you here is the variety. They have a decent salad section, italian, chinese, mexican, american, sorta-soul food, american classic, lots of treats too.  Coming here also remind me that America is full of disfigured, fat, rude, mulleted red necks with \"I'm with Stupid\" tshirts. If you learn to ignore that, and this is a must for enjoying vegas...this is the spot to get a nice meal.  I do have one complaint. I've been eating here for almost two years now. And I've seen the food change and come and go. This past weekend, I was witness to horror of all horrors. I had finished my meal of ribs, teka maki, tamales and jello...i went to go get my celebratory coffee gelato. And low and behold, the gelato was gone. all the wonder flavors were gone, replaced with...ICE CREAM...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO....not only that but they had removed the beautiful display gelatos and replaced them with crushed peanuts and sprinkles as display.  Dime store sprinkles ARE NOT EQUAL SUBSTITUTIONS FOR GELATO.  Anyway, I digress. Great buffet if you can overlook the sacrilege of taking away my gelato.  Good prices, pretty decor, great food. MINUS -1 FOR EVERY GELATO MISSING. 4/5."}
{"text":"I've gone to the GVR buffet probably 6-8 times over the past year and I'd say that for a \"typical/average\" buffet, you can't go wrong with the Feast Buffet at GVR, especially considering the price.  If you've gone to the higher end buffets (also much higher priced) like Aria, Cosmo (Wicked Spoon), even Paris, Planet Hollywood, and Mirage GVR generally doesn't compare, but if you're just looking for a nice, clean, good quality standard fare buffet (breakfast, lunch, OR dinner), GVR is at the top of the list.  I haven't been to Red Rock's buffet yet, but I understand it to be comparable. I'll review that one when I go later this year, but in the mean time, GVR is a safe bet."}
{"text":"I went to this location for a work lunch the restaurant was able to accommodate our large group of 40 people. The wait staff would have to be the highlight of the experience. The lay out was great for large groups and the decor was fairly modern. I would say the set up of the actual buffet was rather confusing and the food served didn't seem to be the healthiest options. Most of the food was of brown or white color, not green, orange, yellow, red-- you know-- fruits and veggie options. A wide selection of desserts to tickle your after meal fancy.."}
{"text":"The first time, I've eaten here I was impressed on the price and the selection of food. This was at a time when I didn't go to LV buffets a lot so, I had nothing to compare this too. Now my opinion has changed since the last few times I've been to \"Station Buffets\". Over crowded with people and food is not prepared right. I'm passing on the \"station buffets\" because it doesn't matter which casino you go to, they all serve the same crappy food in which, is disappointing because imagine going to GVR and seeing the same slop as Palace Station. If I ever have to wait over 30 minutes for their food again then I must be out of my mind."}
{"text":"One of the best buffets I have been to for the price and quality. Went on a Saturday night and for $16.99 you get the whole buffet plus prime rib. The sushi was fresh, the pasta was excellent, and the dessert bar was amazing. They have about two dozen pies, lots of shooters, sorbet, cakes, etc.   The staff was friendly and attentive, and even on a Saturday night we were seated within a few minutes."}
{"text":"This Feast Buffet in the Santa Fe is decent, but not outstanding.  When you want to save money and have a decent meal featuring various foods, then eat here. Get a station casino card because you get up to 4 dollars off of your meal when you swipe it at the cashier.    Overall the food is okay and there are times when it's great.  I do love the variety and the size of the buffet, because I'm not walking a football field from end to end to get a bit of everything.  They have a precise menu and stick to it daily, which is nice.  You can always count on having some crab legs at the Asian station for lunch or dinner, and pair that with some carved turkey or prime rib and au jus.  For 14.99 a person (when I swipe my station card) it's not bad for lunch or dinner prices for the type of food they put out.  Tip: Friday and Saturdays are seafood night, and the lines get LONG around 530-730pm, so just be aware of that.  Also, the closet parking garage is the one along the 95, so park or valet there to avoid long walks to the buffet.  Want buffet food without having to drive all the way to or near the strip?  I'd avoid Fiesta and Texas and head to Santa Fe because their buffet is better, cleaner, and the hotel is nicer."}
{"text":"Mehhhh!!! So far the worst casino buffet I've been to. The Indian casinos in SoCal, such as Pechanga, Morongo, and Valley View are so much better than this place. The food taste and variety are below average when compared to the Indian casinos.  We went here on a Saturday (labor day weekend) after reading some of the Yelp reviews. I was very very disappointed over the food quality and variety. The only good thing I can say is, their small selection of desserts were tastier than their other foods. Also, our server Emmanuel was very prompt and attentive, for which we tipped him generously."}
{"text":"I was making some bets at the sports book (No, I didnt bet on the Washington Generals or Mr. T in Rocky 3, although with my track record it would make sense if I did) and my friend declared his hunger.  We assessed our options and then he mentioned the buffet.  I was like I'll feel to much shame riding up those escalators.  He was like lets do it, its cheap.  So I agreed.  The shame wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  When we got to the top, we were greeted by friendly staff and ushered right in.  It was lunch time and the price with the boarding pass was like $6.00.  This buffet is tiny so if you're used to the other Feast buffets at Station Casinos, you'll be immediately disappointed.   While the selections were limited, the food they did have was decent and hot and for 6 bucks thats all I can ask for...........well and a soft serve ice cream machine, which they also had.  Highlights were probably the mac & cheese (I love terrible buffet style mac & cheese), fried chicken (surprisingly tender) and roast beef from the carving station (I know, a carving station at a 6 dollar buffet, gotta love Vegas).    Overall, a solid option if your at the Palace Station retracing OJ's steps to see where he attempted to \"get his sh*t back.\"  Nothing to drive out of your way for but if the wallets tight and you need a lot of chow, its hard to beat this place.    PS- The shame returned on the escalator ride down.  People seem to be staring at you like \"really?  Did you just do that?\" .....just don't make eye contact and it'll be ok."}
{"text":"Good and cheap!!!!!!! It was pretty basic but everything was good. The pastry chef must be well versed in the culinary arts because that was the best part. This place is on par with Hometown buffet so its not top notch...but you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Food is very plain, lacks flavor....kind of disappointing.....  I went on a wednesday for dinner with a friend....  Thy were serving sirloin roast...it suck...  on positive good service and cheap beer at 3 and cocktails at 3 also...  Also the pies are good....  I don't recommend"}
{"text":"Breatfeast buffet is one of the best for Good service and really low price. Can't beat the price for fresh fruits and made to order omelets. To beat the rush you must get there early when it opens."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Lots of different choices. I forget which day of the weekend they have seafood but, I loved the crab legs that you can get sauteed with a bunch of herbs and spices. All types of foods. The dessert section is great too. They have hand scooped ice cream or soft served and bunch of other selections."}
{"text":"This place is infested with cockroaches! And while finding one on the TABLE they offered either a MARTINI or a voucher for NEXT TIME use (buy one get one). Its ridiculous!!!! Usually when things happened like that especially in the food industry, you refund the food. Its filthy and disgusting! Manager night shift on Oct 4 needs some better customer service!! That voucher will not make us comeback!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here many times for lunch and dinner since 2005 and survived the long  lines. I came here today for brunch with my friends and my first time as well. The Feast Buffet is inside the Green Valley Ranch Resort & Casino. It is a display of different dishes mainly Chinese, Mongolian, Mexican, Italian, American. It includes a salad bar with all the works, breakfast dishes , and great choices of roasted meats. A full dessert bar of all your favorite cakes, cheesecakes, puddings cookies, ice cream, soft serve.  My tiramisu was missing on the dessert line and I was a little disappointed so I opted for a combination ice cream mixed together like the Cold Stone Creamery style. I love the mimosa! This place is  the most reasonable priced Sunday brunch I've been to with a full scale of great tasting dishes and great choices available for everyone! Despite the traffic this place gets, service is a thumbs up. I am rating their Sunday Brunch a 5 star for  price (I think it is under priced), menu choices, quality of the food, service, dining interior and decor."}
{"text":"** very upset that i wasn't able to use the 2 for 1 offer on the 19th of june, because station casinos considers that a holiday... it is not a holiday, it is father's day, but not an official holiday... we waisted gas and time. we lost confidence in your business practices. it would have been different if the 2 for 1 coupon specified \"not valid on father's day\" but it did not, the coupon did say valid seven days a week, but not valid on holidays. father's day is a special day, but not a holiday.  - shawn"}
{"text":"I stay at the Palace Station a couple of times each year for business. While not the best buffet n Las Vegas, it is quite good, especially for the price. A great value.  Unfortunately, this draws a lot locals who cause long lines and long waits, as well as an environment filled with half dressed people ( sweat outfits, slippers  and sleeveless tank tops with hairy armpits hanging out). A note to you men who venture out in public thinking that such tops qualify as a shirt - they don't !  Learn to dress. !! Not trying to be a snob but a dress code would be nice.  The locals business is great for the restaurant but a problem for guests such as myself who need to get in and out quickly.  Overall, I recommend this place and I eat here often. The selection and quality of the food is good.  The biggest complaint and suggestions I have for the management is that they need to do something about the bottle neck at the cashier station. It is outrageously outdated with a cumbersome process of figuring out the various Player Card discounts, checking ID's and an antiquated paper process, etc.  And of course, it seems like every other customer has some issue or complication which takes minutes to sort out. It desperately needs to be updated using new processes and technology."}
{"text":"Great buffet, for the price.  We come here on a regular basis, but I wanted to leave a comment about the great service we received tonight from our waiter, Braxton.  Quick and attentive... He even brought me a pitcher of iced tea, as he noticed that I drink quite a bit (he had already refilled my glass 4 times).  Made tonight's dinner just that much more enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Feast Buffet at Texas, has its ups and downs, which made me give them a 3 star rating.   Its downside, the location, seems a bit out of place, hidden behind a bunch of slot machines and next to a Starbucks. Took me a while to figure out, where is the entrance and how to get to it. Where they sat me, was a bit unclean. They had me sit at a table, where they still had like stale food particles in the chair, like they wiped the table, but wiped the table where the crumbs can land on the chair, and not clean the chair. With the fact of it being lunch, I can understand the waiter can be jammed up with tables. But if you see your waiter just leaning against the wall, talking to other wait staff, while I'm sitting there to get a refill after 10-15 minutes, that doesn't really help the review or the business.   Upside, the place did look nice for where it is located. It was roomy and enough room to move. I like the fact that they had a variety of food to choose from, yea, I know its a buffet, but how often do you see a place that does American food, Italian food, Asian food and a salad or taco bar. I also like their selections of desert, even though I still went for the ice cream in a cone.  They had wide variety of desert out there.    So, if they could have the food with a better wait staff and cleanliness, then the place would be reasonable for where it is. Otherwise, its an OK place for a buffet."}
{"text":"The Feast Buffet is the best buffet of all the station casinos. It is reasonably priced and there are great food options for all palettes. My favorite part of this buffet is they have sushi! Granted, it's not the best sushi I've ever had, but decent and better than most buffet type places. They have Italian, American, sushi, Mexican, Asian, salad bar, and dessert stations. Dessert options are plentiful and higher quality than most buffets, in my opinion. There is also a champagne brunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"First buffet I went to from moving from cail good food just not as good service waited way to long for a refill on my drink has a lot of food and nice place"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on the last day of a three day trip.  Wasn't going to do the buffet, but was stuck at Red Rock and decided to take a look.  Wow, only $10.99 for lunch!  I asked the hostess if I could take a look first and was surprised at the size and selection.  I definitely had to give it try after that.  For that price, it certainly beat anything I saw in their food court.  No comparison.  It obviously didn't hold a candle to my all-time favorite buffets on the strip at the Wynn and Bellagio, but for the price, it wasn't bad at all.  It wasn't celestial like the two that I just mentioned, but overall, I thought it was pretty good.  The waitperson I had was great and I noticed a nice little menu book of drinks with $2 on the cover.  She confirmed that all alcoholic drinks from that book were only $2.00 each!  I looked through the whole book (quite a selection) and saw that they not only had beer and wine, but also real cocktails for the same price.  The wines listed were Barefoot Cellars so I passed on that (but thought the price to be highly reasonable) and ended up having a Skyy vodka Cosmopolitan and also a Stoli Blue Lemonade.  The portions were generous and there was definitely alcohol in there.  Amazing for the price!  During the feeding frenzy, I recall the following on my plate...sushi, spaghetti and meatballs, fried chicken, turkey, roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy, stuffing, pizza, carnitas, spring rolls, chicken soup, and lord knows what else that I just can't remember.  And yes, I only took a little of each, but even then...yikes.  Far from the strip, so certainly not worth a special trip, but if I'm in the area, I'd definitely do the lunch buffet here again."}
{"text":"This buffet used to have higher quality food at dinner. I am not a fan of the dinner here, the only things I think are tasty are the Chinese food items. Everything else is just ok to me.  The breakfast is really a solid deal. I think it was $6.99 and that includes drinks too. Highlights are an omelette station, good bagels with a variety of cream cheese flavors, fresh salads and pinto beans.  I am not very fond of the buffet experience because it always feels like a hassle to stand in the lines and wait for people to pick through whatever item and they seem to take sooooo long (sorry Mom, you are one of those people... the best tasting green bean is not hidden below the other 100 green beans in the same pan). Some of my food gets cold and I also have to walk past rude people that cough and sneeze without covering their nose or mouth.  It is also not very wheelchair friendly, they tried to seat us at an aisle table with my sister sitting in her wheelchair in the aisle. Nevermind that someone might bump into her in that narrow aisle or carry a plate over her head and drop it by accident. Negative star for the rude dinner hostess staff that rolled their eyes at us for wanting to wait for a different table."}
{"text":"Cheap and good for lunch  I've gone to a few buffet in Vegas and for the price its so worth it.  They had a variety of food and pretty much it was all good.  There was some salads that were okay but over all the main dishes made up for it."}
{"text":"Well we  definitely can say that we tried all the station casino buffets. Some I gave reviews and some I haven't , I personally am not impressed with any of them.   This buffet has very nice Decor that gave the place a lux appeal. We usually like getting a booth but the place was busy so we settled for a table. Which was nice the seats were over sized and comfortable.   Our waitress was great she tended our tables & kept it clean even made sure to keep our drinks filled. We never got the chance to get her name cause she never stopped moving. -great customer service.   The food selection was ok. It had a few more options then the last buffet(the festival buffet @ fiesta casino) So that was a plus. The only thing  I have to complain about the select was they had a very little seafood selection. :/  I think we are done with station casino buffets ."}
{"text":"This place was busy for the champaign Sunday brunch. Sara was our server and she was very good at refilling our drinks and picking up our dirty plates. The food was good our only complaint was that some of the food got cold by the time we got to the table. When we told her , she addressed the issue with the kitchen manager. Amazing customer service.   There was a wide variety of food to choose from I was very excited there was seafood as part of the Sunday brunch. The mini waffles were so good. The eggs Benedict was the only issue we had the poached egg was fully cooked and the hollandaise sauce was cold probably should be a made to order kind of item like an addition to the omelette bar  ( which by the way was so good ) we rate this place a 4 out of 5 and definitely would come back"}
{"text":"A relatively large buffet located inside the Red Rock Casino. The price is reasonable.  Usually short lines although sometimes up to half an hour.  Good variety of food. Friendly efficient employees. The food quality is very good for a buffet.  Love the desserts."}
{"text":"The place is a dump! Poor service.... It took over ten minutes to get coffee and another five for the Non-Dairy Creamer.... (they have no cream!)   The food didn't make me ill, which was a plus, but it is nothing to write home about either.   I felt like I was doing myself a disfavor by even sitting there. The line to get into the buffet was long for a less-than-average selection and the restaurant didn't even have Keno, so that I could waste away slowly and possibly not tell that I was in decay....   Two stars because I didn't have to get my stomach pumped afterward."}
{"text":"Three stars for customer service, but the food is getting worse.. I have been coming here for the past 4 years and they have taken away a lot of the dishes we enjoyed eating!! The shushi is not good it's dry!! It's hard to eat bc the food just isn't good!! We used our red rock reward card ontop of the coupon they mailed us!!"}
{"text":"Where do you go when everyone in the house wants something different ? A buffet. I've tried and loved the Feast at Red Rock so decided to give Sunset Station a shot. There is something here for everyone. I visited during the week for lunch with the family.   VALUE Can't beat the price$1.00 margaritas and about 8.00 a person with boarding pass for the buffet at lunch.  FOOD Each station had a little of everything, as all buffets do. The food was warm and well stocked. Some of the food was a little bland, but overall the quality wasn't bad.  Especially considering the price. The kids enjoyed the endless options of desert and I had the peach cobbler which was amazing.  SERVICE The staff  everyone from our entrance, to departure were friendly and helpful. Our drinks were consistently filled and the table always cleared. They were also very patient and friendly with my little ones. We felt very comfortable a result of the great customer service.   ATMOSPHERE The environment was clean, bright and modern. It's great for a quick bite with the family. Casual and comfortable environment. Very friendly patrons, mostly locals and seniors from what I could tell.  It was not crowded or overwhelmingly noisy as there are plenty of tables and space.  OVERALL It was convenient, offered a great value, average food with above average customer service with  pleasant guest. Definitely family friendly, I will be returning to try breakfast."}
{"text":"Horrible waitress, not horrible staff. If it pains you to bring  napkins then you should not be in customer service. mediocre food at best. Truly disappointed"}
{"text":"This is about 8 miles from the strip, but well worth it!! You of course walk through the casino to get to the Feast Buffet. This is not a problem because The Red Rock Casino is beautiful open airy and clean! I was thrilled that I did not have to wade through a thick cloud of smoke or stale smells in order to get to The Feast Buffet.  The food was fresh and presented in an appetizing way (as apposed to just put out in a cafeteria style.)  I was very happy with the Sushi bar.  Although it was not extensive it was FRESH and the slices of salmon were THICK! The sushi rolls were also tasty.  My husband enjoyed the prime rib, which they offered to put his slice on the grill to cook it more if that was what he preferred, which he did.   The Salad Bar had a large variety of mixed green salads, and pasta salads and fruits~ all at the appropriate temperatures.   The deserts were also delicious! I was happy to discover that even the sugar free deserts were yummy, with the right texture, as apposed to dry or \"tough.\"    We ate there on January 18, 2016.  We will go back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this buffet three instead of two stars was for service, and this included the sweet attitudes of the hosts, servers, and cooks. Usually in a buffet, I am hard-pressed to find complimentary things to say about the quality of the food represented. I found it tasteless at best, spicy at worst. The chow mein was mushy. The pizza was bland. Even the desserts lacked any real tastiness."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel from a groupon offer and came here for lunch and breakfast.   Well the buffet is really cheap so can't expect much from this place. The food is very bad quality and just really tasted horrible. In my opinion it was worse than hometown buffet or any mediocre buffet.   Even the eggs at breakfast was so soggy and gross. How can anyone mess up scrambled eggs??  I didn't even finish my plate it was so bad.   If you are truly desperate for food and don't have much money on you then come here. Otherwise, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sometimes there are big lines and sometimes not. The lines go pretty fast. Staff is pretty on it and mostly friendly. Here's what I like. Salad bar is above par and has a good selection. Had the broccoli soup. Wow it was good. Didn't want to fill up on just that but I could have. The roasted corn is good if it doesn't sit to long, Roast beef is sometimes dry but very good last time. I like the sausages and it has a snap to them. Garlic chinese chicken is good and the desserts are very good too. I would pass on the ribs only because I make better ribs by far! Overall this buffet has variety and the quality is good. Better than most for the price. On seafood night they really pile on the crab legs even if you say you want a small amount. I guess that's a good thing."}
{"text":"One of the better buffets in Las Vegas for the value. Yes, you have to drive a little from the strip but it is well worth the price. I always have good service from the Staff there. As far as the food, I think it is a cut above the buffets that are the same price or less. There are better buffets in Vegas, but of course they are more expensive. It is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I was surprised that this buffet was super cheap until I eat here and found that the low price should have been half its price. All the food at this buffet tasted bland and foods that seemed easy to make were tasteless! I usually love mashed potatoes but I couldn't even finish the small amount I put on my plate, not good. Also, most of the foods they offer are basic junk foods such as pizza, nachos, french fries, and macaroni and cheese. Kids would probably like it but I think you can make it better at home. Overall, don't waste your money, even if it is cheap!"}
{"text":"This is in my opinion the best Station Casino Feast buffet. Came here with friends to celebrate a friends birthday.   I've been here in the past & it was poor. Cold food & old food used to sit.   Today we came in for the Saturday night dinner. It was much better than the last visits I remember.   I saw that they have cook to order burgers & Philly Cheese Steaks. Yummy!  Glad we used or 2 for 1's here instead of Red Rock.."}
{"text":"As far as cheap buffets go, this one has the best dinner buffet for a small selection.  They will be more than happy to help you in any way they can.  I have quite I few food allergies and I have to be careful of what I consume... I love orange chicken and I noticed they had sesame seeds on it.  When I asked the staff if they have some without sesame because of my food allergy.  They lady I spoke with was more than happy to make an entire NEW tray.  I thanked her 10 times at least.  Then another cook spoke broken enlgish talked to me, he said, \"you no see what you want, you ask us we make it for you.  You happy it make us happy.\"   He was very kind and so was the rest of the staff.   I've even met the head chef one day and he was very apologetic & respectful when I told them there was a problem at the buffet."}
{"text":"I had a Free buffet for my Birthday this month and I wanted to use it before it expired.  I've been to the Feast Buffets at Green Valley & Palace.  I figured we'd give Red Rock a try since it's supposedly just as good as Green Valley Ranch's Feast Buffet. BOY was I upset yesterday (1/27/2014).  First of all, I have allergies to a lot of things.. Wheat, corn, peanuts, sesame seeds, and walnuts are the worst. I try my best to avoid anything of the sort unless it's a cheat day and I can sneak by eating something with a bun.  After we paid we ordered our drinks with our waitress who seemed nice.  I then walk up to the american section and I had a question and I'm watching these two cooks yucking it up and chatting just ignoring me. Finally I say to them, \"I have a QUESTION.\"  The guy loses his smile and says to me \"what can I do for you MA'AM?\"  (I'm only 24).  I asked him \"do you have cook to order Philly cheese steaks here?\"  I was feeling froggy and wanted to cheat my diet and enjoy a night out with the family.  So he snaps back at me, \"NO, we have cook to order PASTA down there\".   Okay really I'm SORRY I interrupted YOUR hysterical story!  I didn't even bother complaining because I know this guy's attitude was I could CARE LESS!  Pasta is a dime a dozen and I felt it wasn't worth the itchy hives I would experience.   I go to the Taco section and made myself a taco... The flour tortilla was hard as a rock and the beef was really watery. I should of known by the way this started it wasn't going to get any better.. So I look for greens like Broccoli and sure enough I found some it was fairly edible. I ended up eating Mashed potatoes and Broccoli for the remainder of my visit.  Everything else wasn't worth the break out since it had been cooking under the heat lamps to the point where it just looked old and gross.  Each time I went up I checked to see if they had put out a fresh batch it was the same old batch.  I just gave up and wanted to leave, so I felt disgusted and felt like hitting the slots.. hoping it would perk me up.  Judging by the reviews I wasn't the only one who was upset about the quality of food.  (referring to Ridin S. date posted 1/5/2014)  Shame on me for thinking you guys had stepped it up!  GRR what a waste of my free buffet.  Glad to know you value of food has gone up and quality is right where it's always at, crappy."}
{"text":"After reading reviews for this feast buffet, I was prepared for it to be mediocre. That is exactly what it was. For ten dollars....I would go back.   Some highlights: Salad bar was fresh and had great wet salads  Terriaki chicken thighs in Asian stationed were juicy and flavorful  My man recommended the fried chicken from the American station and I like the Collard greens and creamed corn.  Italian station can be avoided nothing special but did like the meatballs Highly disliked the dessert station all my choices were super old and to dry or too soggy. Stick with ice cream! Our service was good. We are gonna try breakfast next."}
{"text":"We are seated in the back on the far right near the trash or something.  The stench back there was awful and I was thoroughly upset at the poor food quality. We spoke with the manager and told him about the service & the poor quality of food he said he would talk to the chief. I guess we'll have to try again some other time. Maybe when Dinner is FRESH."}
{"text":"4 stars for food, but zero for the horrible unorganized line to get in. High rollers and regular people get mixed at the cashier's and heaven forbid if you go back  into the wrong line. The asian lady cashier will bite your head off.  The  Food is good most of the time, but be prepared to wait and wait if you don't have a high roller card. On a recent day, waited for over an hour just to pay, then another 30minutes to be seated. Plenty of empty seats, but not enough servers?"}
{"text":"Food looked and tasted really good. It just threw me off seeing people licking their fingers and then reaching for the laddles and tongs to grab their food. One lady licked her fingers, poured herself some posole (soup) and stuck her hand in the oregano (there was a spoon in there), sprinkled it on her soup the dusted what was left on her licked  hand back into the bowl. Ugghhhh.... it ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"Arrived around 6pm on a Tuesday and the line was long enough for a 15 minute wait. I was treated out to 3 glasses of Arnold palmers, 3 plates of entrees, dessert plate, coffee and sorbet to go in that order. Love the fact that right by the booths there are big round tables to accommodate families of 6-8 people. My server was quick to get me some hot sauce and refills in a timely manner. The pasta station fills your plate up so be prepared if trying to get some shrimp."}
{"text":"Free buffet due to points being redeemed. Three lines consisted of disabled, presidential and chairman. Alot of senior citizens out around 1pm and traffic was busy indeed. Took about 15 minutes to be seated. Our host Valerie was pretty overwhelmed when she took our drink orders that when it came to me wanting red wine it became a big deal. She was nice to explain she can get it but it will take a few minutes so I was okay with that. When it came to paying she needed to know card or cash in advance but we wanted to pay with redeeming our points. All in all she wasn't aware that we could redeem with our points and a friendly tip would be to order alcohol at the front counter prior to being seated. I enjoyed the baked fish and the Mexican food alot.  Not really a big fan of the dessert and wished they had shrimp."}
{"text":"I love Red Rock Casino's  Buffet!!!!!!!  Seafood  Fridays  rock,  love crab legs.  Also  if  you  Want  a  great  Shrimp  scampi,  this  is  the  place.  You  can  grab  the  shrimp  cocktail  and  brink  it  over  to  the  Italian  section.  They  will  take  your  shrimp  and  make  you  a  fresh  scampi  pasta,  made  with  Chardonnay  right  there  for  you.  The  fresh  scooped  ice  cream  is  great.  Saturday  Prime  Rib  is  excellent  too.!  The  Waitresses/Waiters  are  great!"}
{"text":"The Feast buffet is still A-OK. The food is pretty good, but nothing extraordinary. I did notice that they have added a lot of customization to the buffet recently. They will cook to order pasta, burritos, stir fry, ice cream shakes and Cajun crab. I didn't get to try the crab, but there were lots of people lining up for it and I imagine that it's like the Boiling Crab. I was disappointed this time because there was no prime rib - the horror!  I keep coming back because I stay at Green Valley Ranch often and get free buffet coupons. I think dinner is around $20, which isn't a bad deal, but I probably wouldn't drive off the strip for it."}
{"text":"I think the sad sad day has finally arrived when gorging myself to the point of bursting is no longer appealing.  There was a time when my Vegas experience wasn't complete without rolling myself out of a buffet, but I've grown wiser (and thinner).  I came here twice over the weekend while staying at Red Rock - once for dinner and once for brunch. Both were $16.99 after the $2 player's club discount and we also had coupons for 1 free buffet and 2 for 1. So for the 3 of us, it ended up only costing $6/person. That's cheaper than McDonalds! You should check the local paper because there are always coupons.   It was slightly disconcerting that the food at dinner and brunch was mostly the same, but it's not often that I have the opportunity to eat prime rib for breakfast. There are tons of choices from Italian to Asian, Barbeque, Sushi and \"International\" (which appears to be mostly Mexican). The prime rib is very good, but some of the other foods were a little dried out. The tortillas were like cardboard and the biscuits shattered into a million crumbs when I tried to split one. I also liked the mashed potatoes and tapioca pudding - I know, I know, I can't help it, I love cheap carbs.   Service was very good and our plates were always cleared quickly and drinks were refilled. I'll probably come back if I stay at Red Rock again, but I might be steering clear of buffets for a little while."}
{"text":"I thought that this Station Casino Feast buffet had shrimp like GV Ranch feast buffet, but I was wrong. I sang on the way there in the car, promising my toddler shrimp. To our disappointment when we arrived, we would not be devouring a plate of shrimp. Instead we forced down some stale fries, bland stir fry, and lots of various carbs and cold meat. The vanilla topping in the dessert section for the bread pudding was like a cold blob and sketchy looking. One positive was our server Manny. He was very friendly and attentive. If you have to eat here, at least have him wait on you."}
{"text":"The Sunset Station Feast Buffet may seem unbelievable, but it is true...it deserves a 5 star rating.  Several years ago, the buffet was mediocre.  But after being remodeled, the place has improved.  The quality of the food has superb other places like the Bellagio, because it has a great presentation and great taste.  I thought the buffet would be the same as before, but the Sunset Station must have channeled lots of money to improve the quality.    And with the prices, it is dirt cheap for its quality.  I think I would pay at least $20 to eat here.  Anyways, if you are in the hunt for a buffet, The Sunset Station is the place to be.  I swear that you'll be giving it at least a 4 star for the quality of their food."}
{"text":"I would stand in line for an hour just to eat here! Wait, I have done that and it was worth it. Great selection from around the world and yummy deserts! I think I've been here almost every time I have been to Red Rock!"}
{"text":"We had been here YEARS ago. The whole experience was amazing THEN!   Should have known, first four plates picked from the stack were DIRTY! Moved to another stack...  Time has passed, OMG, how can the management let this go!!a  Seafood night, hoping for some edible, butterfly shrimp, hard and crisp. Calamari was like bubble gum. Rice was hard, vegetable lo mien was sticky and cold.  Carved beef was ok, don't go for the gravy, tasted of flour. Ham was quite good.   Bottom line, with so many good buffets in LV. Don't go here. Sorry Green Valley Ranch!"}
{"text":"As buffets go this one is solid all around. Easy to get in. Inside Green Valley Ranch Hotel and reasonably priced. We ate the breakfast buffet at about 7:30 and it was not very busy. Super variety of breakfast foods plus salads and a few crossover lunch type items. Waitress was very friendly and food was pretty good. Definately get to the omelette bar and get yourss cheffed up first. Will go here again."}
{"text":"This is a typical buffet here in Vegas. This is my first time here and the food was ok. The price was very good; $9.99 for lunch with your rewards card. You have your Chinese section on the very right side next to the Mongolian stir fry wok. The middle, right across the salad section is where they had their carving station. You can choose from turkey, kielbasa or meat. The pasta station then pizza is to the left of there, then the dessert section. I love my dessert. But it seemed as if all my selection I got wasn't good at all. The ice cream and banana cream pie I got was bland. I took a bite and I was done with it. Even the ice cream wasn't good and it started melting fast. You really get what you pay for. Want something to eat without a high price tag, you can come here and get full. But don't expect to have high quality food. I'll come back I'm sure since I play at this casino. If I didn't, I most likely wouldn't."}
{"text":"Sung to the tune of Eye of The Tiger by Survivor:  Feast Buffet, you hooked me in With your $10 special Stood forever for an awesome feast Just a girl with a will to digest  So many foods I just couldn't wait Everything looked so so yummy Why can't the line move any faster? You must wait just to get to the food  It's the anticipation, its the need for some grinds and I need to eat soon 'coz I'm hungry I get up to the buffet and I start piling stuff And I'm sucking down the shrimp like there's no tomorrow  Hand to mouth it's all a blur Who cares if the food is real salty I gotta eat and eat all I can Just a girl who is really pake*  It's the Feast Buffet and it gave me the runs I was running to the crapper in the morning That's the last time I'll eat there and I pray I'm alright And I swear I will never go there, never ever!   (*Pake pronounced pah-keh- Local Hawaiian pidgin for a penny-pinching cheap Chinese person, which I am)"}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best and the wait is horrendous.  The only redeeming perk is that they provide free wine at dinner. Granted, its not great wine, but its palatable and its free. My boyfriend likes to gamble at GVR and usually gets several 2-1 coupons during the month; so we eat here quite often. I know it'll take 45 minutes to an hour to be seated, even if there's less than 30 people in line, so I usually bring a book and read in line while he continues to gamble.  I once asked the cashier why it took so long and she said they didn't have enough servers, so they try to stagger the diners.  The food at Sunset Station is the same and the lines move 10 times faster."}
{"text":"Holly crap that was nasty! My stomach is hurting now!the sign says $6.99 but is really $10.99 unless u sign up for their card. The food was just nasty!! It's cheap ass food with no meat.. if you want meat u have to stand in line forever just to get a nasty cut of cheap ass ham... I should have known better."}
{"text":"Great food!  Ask for Hugo, Nadia, or Emmanuel and they will treat you well!  Always smiling with great service.  Love the prime rib on Friday and Saturday and Clam chowder on Friday.  Double Oreo ice cream on the cold stone is my son's favorite part of the meal.  4 stars because I'm not a fan of all the food but there is a great selection and lines can be long to enter."}
{"text":"$24.99 for a seafood buffet is not too shabby! The wait wasn't as long as other buffets such as Wicked Spoon or the M buffet.  You need to have their players club card in order to get the $24.99 price and one card is good for 2 people.  I'm not sure how much it is regularly without the card since myself and my parents had cards and we only needed 2 for our party of 4 that included my brother. They had a good selection of food and I felt that it was worth the $24.99 price.  The only reason I took off one star was for a few reasons: the crab was a little too salty for my liking (although it gave it some added flavor, I was only able to eat one plate full as opposed to my usual 2-3 plates of crab), their shrimp po boys had a weird taste to them (not sure if it was the sauce they put on the shrimp...but also the bread was hard), and their cookies in the dessert section were rock hard.  The dishes I tried included the following: crab legs, steamed mussels, morange glazed mahi, fried catfish and jalapeno hush puppies, tom yum soup, clam chowder, shrimp ceviche, prawns, oyster shooter, and chili mussels.  That's all that I can remember that I ate haha.  I liked that they gave each of us a crab opener device thingy, but I had to ask for more napkins.  One napkin was not enough! They should know that it would get messy! It's a bummer though that this is only offered Fridays in June and not all the time.  I think I shoveled down food way too fast in the beginning because I got full way too fast!"}
{"text":"I gave this Buffet a five-star simply because they are always fast to get us seated and the food is consistently good. The service is always adequate. I don't know really how else to judge a buffet other than the fact that I keep going back."}
{"text":"This buffet is a bit far from the strip one needs to take the drive to this restaurant located inside Boulder Station. The prices are great for a buffet you have to get the \"we love our locals\" card that you can get right outside the restaurant. This card gives you a discount and you can have a dinner buffet for less than $10. There's a big selection on food it's not gourmet quality but it's definitely a great meal for people who would rather spend their money having fun on the strip."}
{"text":"The food at the buffet was OK.  The service was terrible.  I was there with my two minor children and I was denied the boarding pass discounted price for the third person since my card only covers two people.  I was told by the manager after standing the buffet line for 45 minutes to go get a second boarding pass and stand in the buffet line again and use both boarding passes in order to get the discounted price for all 3 of us.  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Get the Aliante Players Club for discount on buffet.  I've eaten at this buffet since the hotel opened and prices are very reasonable, especially for food variety.  You can enjoy Barbeque, Asian, American Fare, Italian, salads, and a nice variety of desserts and gelato.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  Go to the company website to check for Dining Promotions.  Special Nights include:  Tuesday - Hawaiian Pig Roast Night Thursday - Live Pasta Friday - Seafood Saturday - Steak"}
{"text":"The buffet food is really good for the price you pay for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  The lines are long for breakfast if you go around 9:30.. ( so come early!) I rated this place a 3 star because the host \"Betty\" was very RUDE to us! When we first walked in she yelled at us for not paying for my daughter. She never took the time to read the receipt I had. I kept insisting I did until she actually took my receipt and read it. Then... The rest of our party came to join us and that same lady Betty came around the corner and yelled at us saying we couldn't sit next to each other because if we are a party of 10 we need to pay more gratuity. She was jus rude over all, mind you we were only a party of NINE!! she miss counted! But other than that the food was good and the atmosphere was perfect."}
{"text":"Food is the BEST! Service is lousy for drinks, plate removal, etc. If they could just get drinks (water, tea, coffee) to people quickly, tables would turn over a lot faster."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not one of my favorites.  I have visited on various occasions and it seems as if I eat less and less with each visit.  There is definitely nothing extraordinary about this buffet.  I would probably prefer to visit the casinos food court instead."}
{"text":"Wide variety of food items.  $7 with players card.  Lots of fruit, meats, breads, sweets, etc."}
{"text":"Although service was great, I feel my party of 21 was misled by the resort staff when we called and were told there was sushi served at GVR and this is the reason they charge more than other Feast Buffets as well as a better carving station. My son and his friends were disappointed to find there was no sushi and no beef at the carving station. I don't think the rice we paid was worth the selection and we could have just gone to another station casino for less."}
{"text":"Feast Buffet is pretty decent. We have had a couple of bad experiences, but not from the food. There was a horrible line issue once, and the servers are sometimes slow to refills on drinks, clearing plates, etc.  The Red Rock PP card is the way to go if you are going to eat here. The prices are pretty reasonable. The Saturday breakfast is nice, and the Sunday buffets are a treat. It is also awesome getting the B1G1 coupons in the mail.  We have been other times to eat, but not for the Friday or Saturday night Seafood/Prime Rib buffets. The selection of food is always good. There is change of items, but the favorites always remain.  I wish the kids buffet price was a little bit cheaper. We have a small child who can be a picky eater, so it is often not a good value for him to eat.  Overall, the Feast Buffet in Red Rock is a great choice and value for the people of Summerlin. It is always busy when we're there."}
{"text":"Worst buffet I have ever been to. The only saving grace was the Mexican food station. Even the dessert was terrible. How do you mess up soft serve ice cream? Trust me your better off going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Not too impressed with this buffet. Price wise it's pretty reasonable but personally I still don't think its worth the money for me. By all means please do not let that stop you from going. I just like more variety and better tasting food. The best thing I found was the prime tube even though there is not a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"We came for the Momosa Brunch and waited an hour in line. The cashier copped an attitude because the hostess directed us to the wrong line. The food was crap. We had the one waitress who was rationing the Momosa's. Overall: Sevice was crap and Food was crap. Don't waste your time or money. We found Lolas in Summerlin has a real bottomless Momosa Brunch."}
{"text":"Awesome little Buffet if you're not looking to head all the way to the strip and hit up one of the big joints. The service here was on point and I don't think my drinks got below half full the whole time. My favorite dish on the buffet here is hands-down the Mongolian Barbeque. The runner-up would be the Italian section with the baked rigatoni and I usually put the meatballs over it. On Sunday they have the endless champagne brunch which only comes in at $17 so if you like to drink this is a steal of a deal. Lines aren't too bad on the weekend at Peak time you can expect to wait 20 to 25 minutes tops."}
{"text":"You really can't beat the price of $5.99 (beverages included!) for a breakfast buffet! Egg cooking station alone is worth more than that. Had a delicious freshly made omlette with bacon, spinach, bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, and loads of cheese!   Overall, not a large selection and not everything is great, but if you stick to what's good, you'll leave here very satisfied!   Notable items: - Freshly cooked omlette from cooking station - Make your own tacos from the Mexican section - Breakfast burritos - Breaded chicken cutlets - Bacon - Pancakes - Waffles - Donuts (if you dig past the stale ones)"}
{"text":"My first time here and it was a very mediocre experience.  The cashiers were super nice, engaging and complete with a genuine smile.  My hostess was completely different. No personality, though polite. I was so hungry I wanted to go start checking out the food, so I asked the hostess if she could get me an ice tea.  She told me, \"You can order that when your server comes.\" In a tone of voice that resonates, \"that's not my job\"  Woah. Guess who hates their job.  I stood by my table and my server arrived, I order my drink and went to get my grub on.  Everything looked ok, nothing really stood out as eye popping - most people eat with their eyes.  The BBQ / Hamburger station was average. I was grabbing some mashed potatoes with beans when the Customer next to me asked for fresh baked chicken. The chef pulled out a big metal tin from what I assumed has been sitting in a warmer, by the looks of the chicken in it, it looked like the chicken has been sitting for awhile.   Skip the roast chicken.   Next segment was the Asian offerings. There's a build your own Pho. There were 2 huge rice pot warmers, one for white rice and the other for fried rice. I love fried rice, so I grabbed a bowl and opened the pot.  Yikes! I quickly closed it because it looked like mush with vegetables. Skip the fried rice.  There's a Mexican station, It didn't look very promising. There were ore made tostadas and quesadillas but you can look at the tortilla and the topping were dried up and crusty.  Moving on...  The carving station looked great! They had turkey breast, roast beef, and meatloaf.  Meatloaf? That's new.  I asked for a piece of meatloaf and roast beef. The chef gave me such a thin slice of meat loaf that it crumbled in my plate.  I asked politely if I could get another piece.  He did the same thing, sliced it so thinly that the loaf crumbled on my plate. Now I have a small pile of meatloaf mess. Unbelievable.  My roast beef slice was so thinly sliced as well. They should just serve deli meat or find a new chef who knows how to properly cut a piece of meat.  Their dessert selections are probably the most impressive part of their buffet offerings. Even the salad bar looked depressing.  I sat at my table eating the few things I thought were good. That would be mac n cheese, select vegetables, my meatloaf crumbles, one piece of fried chicken, au gratin potatoes and hush puppies.  Actually the hush puppies were mush but it was a tasty mush.  The whole time I sat at my table, my server never came back to check on me.  My final summation is don't eat here. On purpose.   Honestly, if I was the F&B manager here, I would be embarrassed to even offer and operate a place like this.   I hope you read this and I've saved your life from an Un-WOW experience.  :("}
{"text":"We went for dinner mid week.  The wait line was not very long only about 15 minutes. The ambience is nice, very spacious, and brightly lit. They have many stations with a lot of choices of food.  The buffet fails in the quality department.  The fried chicken breast was cold. The taco with shredded pork was so juicy that when it was picked up the meat fell through the taco. A Cannoli with crème that was dried out like it must have been there all day. However the cold seafood and sushi choices were good and tasty.  The salad bar has a wide selection of fuits and vegetables.  Glad we were using a 2 for 1 local's coupon, else I would have felt cheated."}
{"text":"Price was okay and food was alright. The only dislike, staffs weren't as friendly. Poor customer service. Overall, food was great!"}
{"text":"One of the best station casino buffet. I'm a local here and my family usually come here to eat. My youngest son loves eating here because he said it's very clean. Customer service is always awesome. If you have a players card you also get a better deal. We also come to Red Rock Casino to cash our check and that too, we always win a free drink and discount for Buffett."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the $9.99 buffet. The staff was nice and helpful. I really wanted to like the food, but I just couldn't. Everything was dry like they had been sitting out for a while. The brisket was tough. The only thing that I really liked was the albondigas soup. It needed a little salt, but it was very good."}
{"text":"Usually I'd give this place around a three, it's not AMAZING but it's not bad either. The food is always decent, it's a clean place, I've never had a particularly bad experience until the last time I went.  Prepare for a LONG line. My shortest wait was a half hour, longest wait was an HOUR. I waited an hour last time for the brunch buffet. Endless mimosas come with the purchase of your buffet which is awesome. Except they're not endless.  I got my first plate and drank my first mimosa, fully expecting to come back with my second plate and see another mimosa waiting for me. Well, I sat down to the same empty glass. \"Ok\" I told myself \"maybe they thought we left no big deal they'll fill it now that I'm seated\" I finished my second plate in about ten minutes and still... Empty mimosa glass. I saw people coming around and picking up plates/cleaning tables but no one filling glasses.  I got my dessert plate, sat down, and saw someone walking around with a bottle of champagne. great! I'll at least get a second drink! Well, no that never happened. The person filled pretty much everyone else's glasses except mine, I took a bite of my cake, and left. We waited in line an hour, spent probably 45 minutes inside, and I got 1 mimosa.  Advice to the establishment not that it matters because you'll get people to dine here regardless: if you advertise ENDLESS MIMOSAS, don't let an empty glass sit there for well over a half hour..."}
{"text":"The varied ratings for this buffet will tell a story not easily understood by people who haven't been to Palace Station's buffet more than once or twice.  Your dining experience will vary GREATLY, depending on the time of day and your fellow diners.  If it is crowded, things get messy, food isn't filled quickly enough, stuff gets missed and it turns into a barely passable heap of mediocrity. If it's quiet the food is fresh and tasty with plenty of options.  So what do I mean about fellow diners? Well, I don't want to sound like a snob, but this place's status as one of the cheapest buffets around (which is still edible) draws in some....... diverse elements. You'll see the families who seem to have 17 kids lining up for this one and once inside they will behave like they are around their own kitchen table with all the resulting chaos.  Very LOUD people also seem attracted to this one.  Breakfast is a completely different demographic and has been pleasant every time I have tried it."}
{"text":"Red Rock's Feast Buffet looks like it should be great and has the strongest Asian section of all Station Casinos and also the best desserts.  Unfortunately most of the other fare is a little tasteless, heavy or underwhelming.  Vegetarians such as my wife should be warned that unless you want a carbtastic plate of mashed potatoes, cheese pizza, mac and cheese etc you'll be miserable and wondering why you forked over your $17 for dinner.  I would happily eat here just for the Chinese food, but for the higher price (than other station properties), Red Rock is surprisingly hit and miss."}
{"text":"For some reason I really like the Feats buffet at Santa Fe Station.  My wife is a vegetarian and really HATES the place, so those who don't eat meat might want to avoid.  The food seemed a bit tastier than some of the other station properties and I really enjoyed their Asian section. It's also a very good price, particularly with a coupon."}
{"text":"For the price the Feast Buffet at Texas Station is pretty good. It's firmly toward the higher mid range of the Station Casino buffets.  As you might expect there's a lot of very heavy southern fare on offer here, things like catfish, friend chicken, beans and various chilies abound.  The Asian section is small and occasionally good and there is a large Mexican section which an excellent, made to order fajita station.  Vegetariand might feel a bit forgotten here - My wife usually makes do because most of the time we eat here we have a coupon and it's lunch so our meal costs around $5 - so you can't really complain - however if you draw a bad day you're vegetarian options can be limited to things like mashed potatoes, mac and cheese etc.  The Dessert station is a bit weak.  Overall a good deal, particularly for lunch and if you don't mind a rather heavy meal.  A final note - the location is a bit dicey, directly across the road road from one of the most ghetto Walmarts (outside which dubious characters, inexplicably, seem to like to hang out at night). You are fine in the garage at Texas Station though."}
{"text":"In my opinion The Feast Buffet at Sunset Station is the all-round best of the Station Casino buffet offerings. When we are burned out on buffets my wife and I know that Sunset (particularly with a 2 for 1 coupon which we regularly get our hands on) is good value for the quality.  Perhaps it just has what I like, but I enjoy this more than the supposedly higher end Red Rock and Aliante buffets as well as Green Valley Ranch which has, I feel, gone downhill.  My wife is a Vegetarian and sometimes buffets can leave her with a depressing plate of assorted carbs - Sunset features an excellent Pasta Station which in itself is worth the price of admission and can really save her from the sometimes sparse vegetarian fare across the whole buffet. I really enjoy this feature also.  There's also a self-serve hamburger station, decent Chinese food and well stocked and fresh offerings of all sorts.  The only major weakness of this buffet is the dessert section which is very weak except for the icecream."}
{"text":"One of the few things I miss about living in Vegas is this buffet....I absolutely LOVE this place, it is worth the 45 min to an hr wait to be seated on Sundays...though they offer a wide range of cuisine including Chinese, American, Italian and Mexican I come for the SAUTEED CRAB LEGS ANDSHRIMP...yummmmmmmmmy!!!! ...the mix of garlic, cilantro and seasonings get into every nook of the crab legs and just melt in your mouth...My mouth is watering thinking of it..I can stay here for hrs and hrs just eating away with crab flinging everywhere (this is def. not a first date \"try to be cute\" place)  The Mongolian grill and the Chinese food station are pretty good and everything else is your typical \"buffet\" quality food...  Def. one of my fav spots in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Good buffet. I have only been here for lunch and think it is a very decent buffet. The  Chinese food station is always good especially the wings, ribs and egg rolls. They have a good salad bar and two soups to choose from. The fried chicken is usually good too.The carving station usually has a beef and turkey or beef and roasted chicken.   For the price you should like this place if you like buffets but the line can be very long at peak times."}
{"text":"I love to FEAST!  Feast Buffet at GVR never disappoints.  You really can't beat the price for this buffet and there's rarely a ridiculous wait in line.  There's a wok grill where you can create your own yummy stir fry, a pretty good selection of Chinese food as well as Mexican and Italian food.  There's meat carving and a pretty decent size salad bar.  I enjoy the cocktail shrimp and soup too :)  The dessert station is alright...you can't go wrong when there's ice cream!  They'll also make a milk shake with whatever flavor of ice cream that floats your boat!"}
{"text":"I've been here more than I can count on my two hands since the place opened, but this is a review about my last two visits here in the past 30 days.  When my wife and I don't have cravings that jive, the Feast Buffet is a safe answer.  I find myself first frequenting the Asian section, where they have the Korean BBQ Ribs, Pork Hash and Shrimp Dumplings.  Their white rice is OK.  It isn't as sticky as I like it, but it isn't bone dry either.  Their Sushi section isn't too bad either and is located at the opposite end of the deserts.  Their rolls are very small, probably a tiny bit larger than a quarter.  Their first is fresh and on par with other buffets offering sushi.  The American BBQ section was great.  They have yams there usually, polish sausage and prime rib or beef brisket.   The pizzas they have are OK, the Stromboli was very good on my first visit. However it was kinda dry and crispy the last time I went. :(   For deserts their cookies are better than I remember it.  Nice and soft, not hard as I remembered in the past.  Over all it's a safe choice if you're looking for a deal and realize that you get what you pay for.  Service was great both times from our waitresses.  The place is clean and has a relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was in the buffet on 8-7-14 and I had glass in my food. As I bit into it and tried to get it out of my mouth, a server/cleaner came by and asked if everything was ok. My BF told them no and to please get a supervisor. A supervisor came, them she called security. I asked to be taken out of the restaurant to avoid any further embarrassment. They called 911 and medics looked at me and recommended I go to the dr.  After two trips to the hospital and 3 days with no voice due to scratched throat, and $13,000 in medical bills, they denied my claim and told me, based on the investigation and evidence the committee has respectfully denied my claim. So needless to say, that was the most expensive dinner I had ever had. That was two bites into my meal. They can afford bigger layers than me. I tried to work this out with them to avoid them any embarrassment but they don't want to help me out with my bills.  I've posted a picture of part that wasn't spit into the napkin."}
{"text":"If you have a car take a drive to Red Rock Casino it is worth the drive. They have Asian American Italian food. Lunch is 15$ if you sign up for the player card which is free."}
{"text":"Staying at this hotel so we decided to try. I was the only one at my table who had the sushi and the only one who had a bad case of food poisoning our first night in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very large buffet.     Every cuisine available.      A lot of filler foods and starches.     Salad bar nice.     Hard to eat there if you're watching diet.     Pricey if you don't pig out and go back multiple times.      Average service.    Friendly cashiers at entrance.    Sushi is not appealing nor looks fresh and shrimp were downright soggy."}
{"text":"Been eating here pretty regularly for a few years now. It's kind of our go to when nobody can agree/decide.  That probably came to an end tonight. Worst server ever. Some guy named Yasha? Totally ruined it."}
{"text":"I really expected better, from all the great reviews for this place. We waited in line for ages on a Saturday night, but that's really not unexpected. The price was great, the server was very polite. The food.. Well, the whole thing was like a pretty golden corral, if you've ever been to one.. The sushi was not prepared correctly, but you kind of expect that not to be too great, it's not an asian buffet. None of the other asian food really looked appetizing either.. The italian was ok, nothing more. The pizza tasted ok, but the crust was soggy. The prime rib, however, was delicious. Honestly, it seemed like they had all the right ingredients.. But the flavors for almost everything were just a little off, like they had good intentions but hired improperly trained chefs. Next time we go to Red Rock, we'll probably try something else, even if the price is higher."}
{"text":"Wonderful buffet. Be sure to ask the pasta chef to make you shrimp lemon butter alfredo FRESHLY cooked in front of you. I did not know this until i had seen a local order it. I told him to please give me what he got...it is DE-LISCIOuS!!! The chef was so professional he took a plastic spoon out the spoon box and dipped it in to taste it and then added more spice.  He definetly was a true chef by trying the food before serving it. We enjoyed the desserts also. Hard to just choose from one!!! I would recommend. Arrive early. Long lines."}
{"text":"A local told us to try rhe Feast buffet @ Boulder Station...pretty good. We got a players club and got a pretty good discount.  They had alot of food to choose from. Waitress was fun and accomadating for out big group.  Would go back."}
{"text":"Having lunch  food is ok  service  was ok till  he went on lunch break  and  the new server never returned to see if we need anymore drinks,  that is horrible for such high end hotel."}
{"text":"extra cheap. off the strip. quiet. decent choices. the line can get pretty long but always seems to move quickly. staff is very friendly. seating is comfortable. not worth visiting unless it's a friday or saturday night. that's when they have prime rib and shrimp. best buffet for its price!"}
{"text":"While the Red Rock may be one of my favorite properties, I can't say Feast is one of my favorite buffets. It resembles almost every other Feast in the Station Casino chain, though I think the food options here might be a bit more substantial than the rest. For that reason in addition to the value, this place still gets a thumbs up from me.   Like many buffets at more popular properties, Feast has taken on the concept of offering international variety through stations across its incredibly vast layout. In fact, this is the biggest Feast I've ever seen with a seemingly endless counter of options. It forces patrons to walk decent lengths to get what they want. (#1)  Despite the numerous cuisines, I can't think of one that truly stands out for being outstanding. Ironically, I enjoy coming here for breakfast more than the lunch and dinner hour, but that's just me. During the weekends and holidays, the carving station is pretty impressive as is the dessert + gelato selection. Anything that requires freshly prepared stuff (omelets, pasta, shrimp, etc.) is bound to be halfway decent.  Any of their American preparation is going to look something like a Thanksgiving meal (never a bad thing) and the cold foods, salad section is pretty standard. I particularly love the mini-wedge salads, they're just perfect for the bite sized salad lover. On occasion they'll feature a Mediterranean section, which is decked out in various kinds of hummus and some subpar attempts at a gyro meat.  The only thing I would remove entirely would be the Asian cuisine section. I already though the pizza was an atrocity, but the entire spectrum of Asian food from Dim Sum to Sushi to sad attempts at Canto cuisine are beyond bad. The sushi cuts are terribly done, the seasoning for most of the hot food is way off. I understand the need for this though given the Asian clientele that visit Vegas on a regular basis, but I can't imagine them loving it either.   All in all, the Feast Buffet can execute solid variety without making too much of a dent in the wallet. The lines can get fierce during prime hours, but having a Station players card with status might help with the wait, in addition to saving you a few dollars for each session. The food isn't memorable by any means, but it's far from the worst buffet in Vegas.   ___________ (#1) Laugh it up, but in the Vegas buffet world, that's exercise."}
{"text":"I ate here with my family of 5, a bit costly for what you ge.t. being from the capitol of AYCE buffets ( south Florida) my expectations were surreal for las Vegas.   Used to be that the AYCE system was to allow one to indulge fully and totally in a cheap way and go and play the tables in a semi coma state,  a win win for the casinos.  I came for b' fast,  not all items were out just yet, sad.  The scrambled eggs were runny and wet,  the hash browns were really good(I am aficionado of all things potatos), you see,  not to abandon my AYCE attitude of ayce, eat until one is guilt sated. Grateful to try buffets from all over the world in a secret shopper kind of way... no way!  WAY! Years ago the side strips has little cheap places to eat for 1.99, those were the good old days,  not sure if the feast of gvr was in existence then? Shout out if they were! The decor in this place was nice,  the opening line was so fraught with a long wait time.  Typical of buffets, anywho, not sure if I recommend this place to anyone,  we won't be back anytime soon.  Feast can raise a star if they start to make a better effort all around. Go to red rock, munch better.  Munch better value for your money.  I came back here again and again and still find long lines and people roaming about grumbling about how not everything is out nor empty trays without being attended to.  Not good.  Get it together feast.  NO WAY CAN I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE , AND I'M THE KING OF BUFFETS!  LONG STORY SHORT,  THIS PLACE REALLY FKN BLOWS.  SHIT BREAKFAST BUFFET IS THE WORST.  BACON UNCOOKED,  SITTING IN PANS OF WHITE GREASY FAT, I KID YOU NOT.   AVOID, AVOID, AVOID TIL THIS PLACE CLOSES DOWN.  GOING TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH BBB AND FOODS AND BEVERAGE DEPT OF NEVADA! SERIOUS."}
{"text":"For the price there is no better buffet in Vegas in my opinion than this and the Red Rock buffet. Get a players club card and get your buffet for slightly cheaper too. The selection is great and the food is good quality for the low price of this buffet. This is definitely a must stop for me whenever I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"(A quick disclaimer. This review is almost the same as my review for the buffet at Green Valley Ranch. They're the same hotel chain the the buffets are very similar. Both are great choices.)  For the price there is no better buffet in Vegas in my opinion than this and the Green Valley Ranch buffet. Get a players club card and get your buffet for slightly cheaper too. The selection is great and the food is good quality for the low price of this buffet. This is definitely a must stop for me whenever I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't think I will be back anytime soon, the food at the Asian counter are hard for beening under the heat lamp to long and the dipping sauce is spoiled aka sweet and sour."}
{"text":"They told us they had space for groups but wouldn't give my Title-1 team a group rate. These kids live in Texas's neighborhood and have family members that work for Station casinos. Said they donate to a school already but didn't think it was a public school. What a shame."}
{"text":"great price, with great selections. food is ok.... better than macdonalds."}
{"text":"-Delicious tender prime rib -Yummy crab frying station -Mongolian BBQ station -Create your own omelet station  -Breakfast buffet items probably not worth getting -Asian buffet station not too bad, the pork BBQ ribs were pretty good  -Ok salad bar, good assortment of toppings (delicious pumpkin seeds!) -Yummy cocktail shrimp  -Variety of cakes and desserts -Red velvet cupcake was too dry -Tiramisu could be better -Cheesecake too sweet -Good ice cream selection with different types of cones or in a bowl (I liked the coffee/mocha flavor)  -Restrooms are in the casino, not in the buffet (just tell the cashier that you're going)  -All in all, pretty good deal for $18 (use membership card for $1 off - you'll also get free $3 in slot play), it's worth it just for the prime rib, crab, and shrimp, topped off with some ice cream on a sugar cone. Everything else was meh.  Sorry this wasn't in paragraph form...typed on my iPhone! =P"}
{"text":"Did the dinner buffet as guests of Las Vegas residents. I'm not a fan of buffets. Too many choices. Too much waste. I perused the different stations that featured different ethnic/regional foods. I love sushi and while there were three different kinds of rolls, they were meh. The Mongolian station was wonderful. Select your fresh veggies, noodles, meats and sauces and watch the chef grill it to order. The char siu ribs at the Asian station were delicious but a little on the dry side. Huge selection of desserts including soft serve, ice creams and a bread pudding station. Overwhelmed not only by the choices but by the amount of food. There were some serious eaters there, some in wheelchairs, others tethered to oxygen tanks. I enjoyed my ribs and Mongolian entree. All the other stuff was just way too much. First trip to Vegas/Nevada. I guess it's customary to experience one of its buffets. Did. Done."}
{"text":"This used to be our \"go to\" local buffet, but although I do like their selection, I've found that I feel kinda overly salty and bloated afterwards :(.  Also, I have gone twice when it's prime rib & shrimp night (saturday) and the shrimp is not deveined, and sometimes they taste like, overboiled or overcooked/mushy.  It's not terrible, but not like fresh tasting.    What's nice is that there is a decent discount if you have a Station Casino players card, it's like $13.99 on regular nights with the card vs $18.99. Saturday nights are like $17.99.... something like that.... It is also better than the Feast buffet at the Aliante hotel (didn't like that one at all unfortunately... didn't seem as good quality as Red Rock)  Recently we discovered the Silverton buffet and I have enjoyed that it's not as salty, and their saturday Polynesian night is pretty good.  Their regular weeknight buffet is good too, although the selection is not quite as large as Red Rock."}
{"text":"This place is pretty gross (went for breakfast).   1 star for the price... $4.99  However, the food is bad. Nothing is cooked correctly, the food is sparse and the lines are stupid. Waffles were soggy. Eggs were gross. Desserts were bland. Bacon was greasy and floppy."}
{"text":"The feast buffet at the Red Rock is pretty good. I went there for brunch with my mom and I was very satisfied with the selection that was provided. For pastries, they had donuts, cookies, muffins, all good things that you would want to eat for breakfast. Of course they had real breakfast items like bacon, eggs, pancakes, waffles, and French toast, which is my favorite kind of food to eat! I was quite impressed with the cornbread they served! The lunch portion had some good prime rib being served along with chicken, Chinese food, Mexican food, and sushi. No complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"This is a solid buffet. It has sushi and brisket which is a little different from most buffets that are off the strip. You can't go wrong with the member card either as that significantly lowers your price. The lines are hellish long though. Expect to wait about 30 mins easy whether it is lunch or dinner. I love their olives and mushroom salad as their salad bar area has alot of unusual tasty treats."}
{"text":"Solid buffet. They don't have the exotic stuff but solid and tasty. Really cheap with the Player's card (like 10 bucks for dinner). Everything that a typica buffet offers (prime rib, brisket, and various international stations). I would eat here if in the area again."}
{"text":"So at $5.99 for lunch it's hard to complain. The lines are a joke and the clientele is like weight watchers meets Cocoon. Other than that and as long as you don't mind being shoved by 100 year old Asian women, I guess you could do worse."}
{"text":"Just rating the food itself I give a 3 start.  But this is by far the best value in town. For lunch it is only $10.99 and you get a great variety of food. Though I don't think it is the best in quality. I mean, there are only a few items that I enjoy eating like mussels, shrimp, prime rib, gelato, soft serve. Sushi wasn't very good.   So if you like variety and value, this is the place to be. If you want quality food...hmm...I can't even tell you where anymore. I think that most of the buffets quality have been deteriorating.   Back about 12  (1996) years ago when I first visited Las Vegas, the Mirage buffet was awesome. Then after a couple years it got really icky. Then around 10 years ago (1998).  Bellagio became the star with lots of yummy. They used to have totally great quality and exotic food (lychee, rambutan, fresh sashimi)  Now they have none of that. Sigh...I can't even find a fancy buffet these days. I went inside Wynn to check the buffet out but it looked so-so. Not too many food that I \"must\" have.  If anyone knows of fancy buffet even with a price tag, let me know!"}
{"text":"If youre trying to have good food on a budget, this is the place for you! This place is a pleasant surprise.  Just off the strip, well worth the short drive. The casino/hotel offers free parking. We came on a Saturday of a Holliday weekend, there was a bit of a line to get in, but it moved fast. We were offered 2 for 4 dollar frozen margaritas in line, not strong but tasty. The food was great, I recommend the pesto chicken and the potato scallops. A well rounded hearty assortment."}
{"text":"As card carrying members of Station Casinos, we \"won\" a free buffet coupon that was only good for a four day period. We had stopped by the previous day and the line was so long, we turned around and walked out. I guess we weren't the only ones who got the free buffet. This time the line was much shorter, with only a few parties in front of us. After a few minutes, I realized the line was not moving. It stayed at a virtual stand still for a good fifteen minutes. No movement whatsoever. When we finally got close enough to the register to see what was going on, the cashier, Maria, was shuffling through what looked like stacks of receipts and coupons, ignoring the customers in line. Finally,  another employee, Glenda, came to the register and told Maria she could ring some people up while Maria continued to look for whatever was so important that they were losing money and people were walking away. Maria declined and continued to stand right in front of the register, looking  and looking and looking, all the while ignoring the customers in line. Glenda tells her again, \"I can ring some people up while you look.\" Again, Maria declines and goes on about looking for the all important piece of paper. Throughout the entire ordeal, Maria did not once acknowledge the customers in line. Finally, she appears to be ready to ring us up. The Mrs. hands Maria the coupon, casino card and money. The Mrs. Also gives her our drink order, as adult beverages are not included. Maria then turns away and starts looking through papers again. Finally, Maria rings it up, but has forgotten the drinks and bonus points that come with the cards. Maria then comes at the Mrs. with attitude and tells her \"you didn't order drinks.\" When we eventually made it to our seats, I asked to speak with a supervisor. Glenda showed up at our table. Yes, the same Glenda who told Maria she would ring people up, only to be ignored. Glenda apologized and acknowledge Maria's attitude and disregard for the customers, but stated she did not want to reprimand her in front of others. Glenda assured us she would address it.   You would think that a casino that claims to \"love locals\" would put a huge emphasis on customer service. I see absolutely no reason or excuse for Maria's attitude and poor customer service. The buffet was what you would expect and on par with what it normally rolls out. However, having it to do all over, I would forgo this experience and pay full price elsewhere. My time is worth much more than a free buffet and I definitely could have gone without the attitude and poor customer service. The fact that Glenda stopped by the table and took the time to listen to our complaint along with her assurance she would address it, saves this from being a one star review."}
{"text":"Garbage...absolute garbage.  Too bad yelp doesn't allow us to rate places with poop emojis or garbage cans instead of stars. This is the worst of all of the Feast Buffets, and we have tried them all.   1. Entry logistics are terrible. Long line, no rhyme or reason to the flow of people, or seating protocols.   2. Food is sub par, for the price. Comparable buffets have considerably better food options and quality.   3. If you have kids, please don't bother. Local or otherwise, skip this place. $14.99 for a 2 year old at breakfast, and they can't seem to figure out how or where to place a family requiring one or several highchairs. Just plain ignorant to the needs of their patrons. Expect no less than a 15 minute ADDITIONAL wait if you need more than one highchair.   4. Hand me a pen that works when you want me to sign a credit card receipt. If your sales counter does not work with the pen that you handed me, get a different pen or counter or whatever...I am being picky here, but please, don't make it annoying or difficult for people to give you thier hard earned money. You are part of a very successful casino chain, you should know how to be efficient at taking people's money by now.   We live in one of the service capitals of the US, and we are accostomed to \"service with an smile\", and pay/tip well for these services. If you decide to eat at this buffet, expect NO service, with a blank stare.   To reiterate, this buffet is complete garbage in all aspects. Pay a little more and go elsewhere, or don't eat at all. You will add years to your life by not consuming this trash, and avoiding the aggravation."}
{"text":"We were staying in this hotel and didn't feel like getting into the car and driving around looking for a place to eat so we decided to check out the on-site buffet for dinner. Get a boarding pass- which is the Palace Station players card. You get a discount at the buffet and end up paying the child's price. You cannot beat the price of this buffet. Even McDonald's for my family of 5 is more expensive than what I paid for the buffet for 5 people.  I didn't really explore the rest of the buffet too much as it's pretty small and the selection and quality are lacking. They even have a carving station which I usually dive right into but the meat lacked flavor and was incredibly dry. The real star of the buffet, and the only reason why I would return is because of the made  to order pasta station. Now that was delicious and I returned again, and again, and again. There aren't even that many choices and I kept ordering the same thing over and over but the pasta was pretty good, considering one plate of pasta at the Olive Garden costs more than this entire buffet. I was craving pasta so this was definitely worth it and hit the spot.   You get your choice of pasta noodles and sauce. Toppings include shrimp, clams, and vegetables/spices such as tomato, oregano, garlic, onions, etc. The small asian man is grumpy and rude and will make you go back to the end of the line if you want to order two dishes. He made my son and I go to the end of the line each time but some old white guy was able to get multiple dishes cooking because he had tipped him. No fair but that's Vegas I guess."}
{"text":"One of our mainstays on the buffet circuit, mainly due to it being the Station Casino closest to our house (so we get to burn our comps here most often).  Breakfast ($6.99 w/ players card) and lunch ($8.99 w/ players card) are pretty good deals, but get to lunch early if you have to get back to work, since I've seen 30 mins lines for weekday lunches. Dinner is $14-15 depending on the day, and $25 on Friday for more seafood, but honestly I don't think it's as good a deal as breakfast or lunch. One of my pet peeves is that there is no decent bread to be had, not even for brunch. Smoked salmon on toast isn't really my thing.  Being off the strip, traffic and parking is not a problem. Service is hit or miss, depending which server you get, as in most buffets.  The food: Over the last 10 years, the dishes served haven't really changed much. The chinese food that's not breaded is typically pretty good, and as a healthy option, the mongolian bbq cooked to order is nice (specify \"no oil\" !). The pasta station provides some relief from the stuff just sitting out in the warming tray, and occasionally the pizza is really good when it comes out fresh (sometimes the crust is a bit thick for my taste). Some vegetable choices are pretty low on salt and high in butter, but the Collard Greens they had today (not always on the menu) were pretty good. The turkey from the carving station is typically cooked well (unlike Southpoint's), and the dessert area is ok.   Not gourmet food, but for a $9 lunch hard to beat."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet I have been to in Vegas as far as overall appearance. They must have at least 8o entrees of different foods from well you know \"around the world\" kinda....sorta......nothing is exotic. It's basically Americanized versions of foods from different mainstream ethnic groups or cultures. Surprisingly the staff seemed pretty indifferent. The chef carving the prime rib acted like he bought that shit himself. I asked for an inch slab to save me a trip I mean shit this is my last few days before bi-lateral hip replacement surgery and I have a ton of moving around to do over the next ten days. Well maybe the fucker had bad eyes but that shit was still you're standard half inch cut. Ass. I would probably rate it closer to 3.5 stars because the food was all nicely arranged and the desserts rocked. Clean serving area and buffet line as well. $16.99 with my brother's club card is a damn sweet price. Standard fare but very appetizing."}
{"text":"I actually wanted to try the buffet at Texas Station, as I'd heard good things about it. But that old phrase, \"Consider the source\", haunted me.  The folks who had told me this are plebian in  their appetites and, while that is fine, they are like millions of others who would not complain if a server continually dripped hot coffee on them throughout the meal.  I got onto the Sunday morning queue and was dismayed as several people - 10, actually - made their way to \"friends\" holding spots for them in front of me.  Oh, well.  At the cashier, I presented my Stations Casino player's card, called a Boarding Pass, and was given a discount.  I was eating free as it was, since I was checked into the hotel and a promotion gave me a substantial dining voucher for the stay.  After having signed in, I made my way into the dining room and was met by a hostess.  My asking point blank, \"Who is the best server here?\" seemed to knock her off guard, as she blinked, and I needed to ask again.  She pointed to a server walking past us, and I said good, I will take a table in her station.  Apparently English was not this person's first language, because no sooner had I sat down, then I was approached by a completely different server who asked my drink order.  \"Water, no ice, please, and orange juice,\" was my reply, as well as, \"May I have a bottle of hot sauce?\"  To which she replied, \"Okay, coffee.\"  No coffee, I said.  Hot sauce only, and water, no ice.  Within 2 minutes I had a steaming carafe of coffee, with all the accouterments, none of which I needed.  And so began another journey into the abyss of Station Casinos less-than-competent customer service.  (Near the end of my meal, the original server again came by and apologized for misunderstanding my coffee order.)    I rose from my seat and proceeded to the buffet line, starting with the  traditional breakfast fare.  The bacon was truly the best thing on the line, as well as some of the best tasting cured pork I have had in a while.  Crisp, greaseless albeit very thin strips, which was why everyone would grab several tong-fuls per plate, they were flavorful and a nice counterpoint to other more unctuous and sweet offerings.  The biscuits were commercial and 'bready', while the \"sausage\" gravy was watery and not in the least full-bodied, with nary a hint of the alleged sausage present.  A tray full of eggs Benedict, something new and exciting, was parked under a heat lamp, which slowly turned nice, poached eggs into small, rubbery orbs.  I got hold of a semi-fresh one and it was very nice, a treat not seen elsewhere.      When I arrived back at my table, I found my plastic tumbler of OJ, which was lukewarm, that being the best quality of this liquid.  It was astringent and tasted as if the proper amount of water had not been added to the concentrate.  As I ate, the server who had been pointed out to me walked by and I flagged her down, asking for cranberry drink and removal of the coffee.  She even wiped down the table, which my server had not done, perhaps because she had not seen the spilt milk from the coffee creamer.  Finished with my 'first' plate, I made my second destination a chafing dish seen on the first go-round.  broiled Swai, sometimes called Vietnamese River Catfish.  It was moist, flavorful and done perfectly.  The tartar sauce was okay but the poor, tired hushpuppies were dry and tough.  Again enjoyed some more bacon along with the fish.  Why not?!  A trip to the Mexican bar proved very disappointing.  Even in America, how can such a rich and flavorful cuisine be rendered tasteless and bland?  Cheese sauce, ground beef in... taco or enchilada sauce, salsa... all devoid of Sabor, flavor.  Very rarely do I salt at the table, and never on South Of The Border fare, but this needed that and more, which is why I had the hot sauce.  Desserts are a real conundrum, as there are so many choices lined up on their own, large island.   Pre-sliced pies beckon, and the coconut cream was the loudest.  Too bad the flavor did not correspond with the visual appeal.  It was, again, competent.  The glazed donut was very much 7-11 quality, which is to say tasty, crunchy and worth about 50 cents.  What passes for ice cream did just that, passed.  In fact, it is NOT ice cream, as the machine is labeled \"soft serve\" only.  Another commercial mixture pumped out for profit.  An unattended carving station left many diners disappointed, as the roasts looked very appealing.  Most offerings were properly labeled, with only a couple sans info. The reality is this:  if you want a quality buffet experience, something over and above the casino-tourist attraction, they exist, but you need to look elsewhere.  No one here at this venue is making anything even resembling fresh-from-scratch food, and if they are, they are using pre-made commercial mixes.  But don't blame them.  Great dining comes second at places such as this which  would rather fill you up then afford a memorable meal."}
{"text":"This was better than most buffets in Las Vegas if you don't mind traveling a little ways away from the strip. The price was right the only bad spot was the Italian section was cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Steak... That's all i gotta say, eat that and it's worth the money. It comes rare but the cook will cook it for you to whatever your preference is. Not to mention the great desserts and international food. To me, number 1 buffet in Vegas."}
{"text":"the price is cheap for vegas/general $10 for dinner. you'll be full. but this won't be the best food. some of it was great most were meh. i give it only 2 instead of 3 starts because the selection was kind of small"}
{"text":"I always come here everytime I visit family in Vegas. The buffet is not at all crowded during the day and the quality of the food and price is excellent.   They have a variatie of foods: American, Asian, spanish, Italian, a barbecue section, and of course a dessert section.  Food quality is excellent on days when its not too busy, usually Monday-Wednesday, Weekends can be a hit or miss as it gets PACKED in here.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we eat here. Both times were for lunch. Probably one of the best buffets for the price. $18 lunch for two people. Can't beat it, especially when the food is also good. Paid $40 for a buffet at golden nugget and got sick with their crap cafeteria food.  I highly recommend this place if you want a good buffet on a budget."}
{"text":"I really wish I could've enjoyed this buffet more, but it's difficult to go all-out at the buffet when your stomach is regretting all of your excesses from the previous night at the bar, haha. Yet even with a hangover, I thought this was a pretty damn good good buffet. The area is spacious and has plenty of options around lunch time. The only item I tried that was not too fond of was the penne pasta. Other than that everything else was tasty. The service was good too, so that's always a plus."}
{"text":"Went for the morning breakfast at 4.99 \ person.  The food was decent however the wait was atrocious. They should have expected a larger crowd considering yesterday was mothers day.  I was at least a 20 minute wait to be seated.   They had the normal standard fair of eggs , sausage , bacon etc.   They did have some good ethnic flavors as the chiliquiles was very good.    Will i be back ? yes but not in the next coming weeks as we just moved farther away."}
{"text":"Not a crab leg or lobster tail in sight but they do seem to have just about everything else here. You will find everything from sushi, braised oxtail, and margherita pizzas to hand-sliced deli meats and cheeses, specialty salads, and scooped gelato, mini red velvet cupcakes, and chocolate eclairs for dessert.  I like that everything is laid out neatly according to cuisine - Asian, Southern/American, Italian, Mexican, etc. and the fact that the salad bar has got more going on than just iceberg lettuce and a few rotten cherry tomatoes. The salad bar was freshly stocked and the rest of the buffet didn't appear to be sitting under a heat lamp all day long, either. And for only $10.99 at the lunch buffet and less than $20 for dinner, it's one of the best deals in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is my go to station casino buffet. I like it here because it's only about 15$ per person at dinner time (with a boarding pass card) and the line goes by very quickly. The staff is super nice and helpful with any and all questions or concerns you might have.  The selection is great as well. They have a Mongolian BBQ section right next to the international grill, where the chefs will also be happy to make you a fresh burger with anything you please on it.  My favorite part about the buffet is that food is constantly being prepared and out out to ensure that your favorite dishes are always available and fresh. I always recommend this buffet to others!"}
{"text":"There was once a time when this buffet was probably in the top ten in all of  Las Vegas, it surely is in the lower rungs now. We remember when they has King Crab legs everyday, and not just on friday. Overall Good variety yes, but so many items that you should not even try to sample, tonight it is the purple cabbage, not over cooked; it was bordering on spoiled! The Chinese section was once a delight and truly a Chinese Dynasty Grill, now it's mostly a nasty grill. The items are surely carried over from lunch and most likely the lunch items were carried over from the previous night's dinner. It needs to be rotated out when it gets soggy and old, don't just cook more and pile it up on top. Tonight the prime rib is tender, but flavorless and the guy carving is burnt out at his work and not even friendly. Ahh, the fried shrimp....some overcooked and dark brown and some under cooked and soggy. Hey here they go again, a new batch is just dumped on top of the old batch. Service is good and fairly attentive, good refills and  a bit slow at clearing the used plates. If you eat here, be selective and choose the standard choices. Don't over do it and go for seconds, it probably won't be as good the second time around. Take my word for it this isn't a good buffet and as far as the Stations casino buffets go, the Red Rock is probably the best. I am sure they have about the  same supply of food items to choose from, but they do something better up on the other side of town.  Too bad all the \"Beast\" buffets couldn't follow suit. C-"}
{"text":"Below Average buffet, especially for Nevada.  Went here on a Thursday night ($19.99 for Adults, $14.99 for children).  An okay selections including made to order gyros and burgers.  The gyro was good (not great).  Standard selections in other selections were like a typical buffet (Chinese, Mexican, Italian, etc...).  A few good options were the sweet & sour fish, the meatballs, the fried shrimp, and carving station.  Most other choices not good like beef & broccoli, fried catfish, and tamales.  Kids liked the ice cream (not soft serve), different options like cookies & cream and mint chip.  The apple cobbler was terrible.  Wouldn't recommend for the price, maybe a better option for breakfast or lunch for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"Watch out for two for one buffet coupons - Station casinos misrepresent their names on the coupons. This lead you to believe that they are good at any of the Station buffets NOT True! Very misleading advertising!!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good for buffet food.  I ate from the Asian buffet, and liked it a lot.  I tasted my kid's mashed potatoes and gravy, and they were really good too.  Tasted the barbecue beef, liked it.  I'm not sure about the Mexican food, we are used to Tex-Mex so it didn't look appealing to anyone in our group.  Didn't care for the shrimp, it was mushy and fishy.  Living on the Gulf of Mexico has us spoiled there, too.  The service was ok, nothing stellar, but who wants tea when you've got all this tasty food?  Gelato is a plus.  The people working behind the counters serving and preparing food seemed to be a million miles away, service was good but the smiles and small talk wasn't there, it must be a thankless job dealing with so many different faces of mindless tourists.  They were working really hard, and it is appreciated!  We do plan to go back for the breakfast buffet on our next trip to Vegas (tickets in hand already).  Advice, be sure they are open before you go, this is not a 24 hour operation, and also if you sign up for players club, you get $5 off."}
{"text":"This is a nice buffet ! You don't feel like you're in a buffet ! The food taste like it's been cooked right away you know ?! We had a party of four and we tried everything that they had and we almost liked everything. Seats are comfortable and the wait staff are professional. Prime rib is good and you can have it right off the grill which is nice ! We definitely going back there!"}
{"text":"This buffet's quality has waxed and waned over the last few years.   Some of the offerings remain great choices: this buffet has excellent Mashed Potatoes and Gravy, Fried Shrimp, and desserts. The carving station (there are now two) generally have a good variety of meats, and the employees will put your selection on the grill if it isn't already cooked to your specification.   However, lots of items lack flavor. The Breadsticks have little seasoning, the Salt and Pepper Wings often taste old, and the Pizza isn't memorable. Other choices simply sit out too long and don't look appetizing, even for a brave buffet adventurer.  This is still a good value for the price of the buffet, and if you have plenty of time you can sample a lot and find the food that hits the spot for you. I'm always looking forward to the Fried Shrimp, and occasionally the dessert area offers individual Toffee Cakes which are amazing."}
{"text":"Not bad, if you like low quality, pre-prepared school cafeteria lunch food. Make sure you ask which dish has the surprise plastic wrap hidden in it. If you find it, you're the night's winner! And the plastic is your prize!"}
{"text":"We went sept 3,2012 at about 1130a and waited in line for 55 minutes.  The food was a 3.5 star and the sushi bar needs help it was horrible. The reason this place gets a 2 is their service. Our server hates his job. He Killed my whole experience. We had to Ask him everytime we needed something. He wasn't wearing a name tag but was a white tall guy, skinny in his early 50s and had the west side section. He needs to be sent to customer service training. Ugh, not going back."}
{"text":"Don't ever come here. The staff is rude and and the food selection is so small. I now understand why it only costs $8.99 to eat here. The food is trash and I regret spending my money here!! We tried to get a burger and the guy ignored us and then another staff member told us that we weren't going to get food if we don't speak up. EXCUSE ME?? There are much better buffets to try in Vegas. Do not come to feast; there is nothing good to feast on."}
{"text":"This buffet is just really average. Most dishes are ok, some are pretty good, but nothing is excellent.  The better -SHRIMP (pile a plate of the cold shrimp at the salad section and hand it to the chef so he can stir fry it with all the good sauces/spices. I like hot, so they used all the spices/sauce for me)..I do have to say that they were a little dry..not great quality..but the seasoning/sauce is just soooo good! -milkshakes (hand scooped ice cream with malt based liquid. It's just a regular small milkshake but it does the trick. -mashed potatoes with gravy (brown gravy is salty and good) -ice cream (had mint chip on a cone and it was yum) -pasta (but only when it's RIGHT out of the oven) I had a white cheesy macaroni pasta and a pinkish pasta with tube noodles and based mozzarella cheese right out of the oven and it was pretty good.   Average/OK/Skip -Prime rib (pretty flavorless) -cookies/cupcakes (pretty flavorless) -pork wonton soup (strange taste to it) -green beans (tasted like the frozen/rubbery kind) -corn (just ok) -peas (just ok)  Overall, we paid the $14.99 and I think I ate our money's worth. The pink lemonade was pretty good too but I'm sure it was just run of the mill soda dispenser lemonade. My boyfriend had about 4 servings of prime rib that he said was \"ok\" turkey that he said was \"ok\" and a few other \"OK\" things. He didn't like anything that much. But I want to go back to eat my weight in shrimp! Yay!"}
{"text":"$36.00 for 2, endless mimosas can't go wrong. Sunday mid day didn't know where to go eat all the buffet on the strip where expensive because they hike their prices on holidays, so I decided to give this one a try.I am glad I did the food was good, and nice vibe. They have a Mongolian station which they cook it on the spot as well as a burger and omelet station.It doesn't have an exotic selection. It's great for kids and if you are just hungry and looking a good place to eat that won't break your budget you found it here."}
{"text":"We went on a Tuesday around 12, it was very crowded. I started off with some sea bass which was good, mediterranean cauliflower- nothing special, some bland mussels, and the worst marsala chicken ever. The cooks had reused some breaded, fried chicken and smothered it in a marsala mushroom sauce. I thought the pigs got a mixture of slop from buffet waste, but the cooks had it twisted that day.   My husband said the macaroni and cheese was horrible and the fried chicken was flavorless. My Dad also didn't like this buffet. It used to be good thats why we went again.  I finished my meal off with some menudo, which was very bland and really not worth eating. The dessert selection was very small. The apple crumb cobbler and ice cream were tasty though. Overall I don't recommend this buffet."}
{"text":"ONLY GO TO THIS PLACE ON FRIDAY NIGHTS. This place is not worth it on any other day. Friday is the only day they offer their delicious crab. You get to pick and choose how much crab you want, and then you take it to a chef and watch them cook it. You have the choices of spicy and mild with everything (cilantro, tomato, and garlic) on it. It's all you can eat so you can go back for more! Their selection of meats are delicious along with their prime rib. I wouldn't wait an hour like I did, but the food is exceptional."}
{"text":"We make it a point to stop by the Palace Station Feast Buffet ever visit. The price can't be beat. Eggs made to order. Fruit is fresh. Great selection of breads and desserts. My favorite dessert is the bread pudding. The pudding sauce is delicious, just a hint of nutmeg."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch because my friends wanted a buffet and one of my friend's has a player's card here so we used her points and discounted rate to eat. Even with the reduced price and on top of it being lunch I don't think it was worth it. Service and staff were excellent but the food was not so good. Underwhelming and not a lot of options even for lunch. Obviously not expecting anything amazing or over-the-top like places on the strip, but in terms of casino buffets I've been to (even in the Midwest) with similar price points this one still falls short.  We went at a pretty normal time for lunch, right before noon. This should be prime time to eat and the food shouldn't have the texture of something that sat under a heat lamp for 10 hours, but it did. Everything was dry/stale and old tasting despite how many people were eating. I just don't understand how it's possible if the food is moving that quickly?? Breadsticks were stale and hard as rocks. Tamales were dry with no flavor and no filling, just masa. One redeeming thing: I ate some mac and cheese that was pretty good, but it still didn't justify us paying buffet costs for one solid item. There were a few other things that we deemed 'okay', as in basically the American station was salvageable but nothing else was, not even the desserts. They were all sickeningly sweet and (SURPRISE) stale. Even the ice cream tasted off.    Looking at the pictures and other reviews I think we would have been better off doing dinner or a brunch here maybe? But lunch left a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"My first day here I was starving so ofcourse I piled my plate full of food and was happily full. The meal is quite inexpensive. Wait staff is nice. Clean setting. Had breakfast and I think dinner there subsequent nights and by the last meal I was already bored. But that's the thing with buffets that don't change it up frequently enough.  For the price it was okay..def not the best buffet I've ever had."}
{"text":"You'd think at a price of $4.99 for a breakfast buffet it would be easy to exceed my already low expectations but you would be dead wrong.  At 7:45 AM every elderly person within 10 miles of Sunset Station was already lined up and ready to feed as if it was their last meal. For some of them it may have actually been their last meal which makes it even more pathetic.  Everything they served seemed delicious but it tasted like NOTHING. Hash browns, nothing. French toast, nothing. Bacon, nothing. I don't know about you, but I generally like my food to taste like something. The only saving grace of this place is that it's cheap and with my points I ate for free. So technically my meal that cost nothing also tasted like nothing. I guess you really do get what you pay for in the end."}
{"text":"We had a party of seven for a late breakfast. The wait was about 20 minutes but seemed longer. We were staring at dirty unoccupied tables the whole time. Lack of sufficient staff meant a longer wait than was necessary. They had quite a few choices but the lines in the food line were long as well. The pre-cooked items were hideous. My eggs Benedict looked good but the egg was rock hard, like it had been sitting under the heat lamp for an hour. The blintzes were inedible. The list goes on. The made to order omelets were good, if only because they were fresh. The price was pretty cheap compared to the strip buffets but I guess you get what you paid for."}
{"text":"We usually attend this for dinner or lunch but we tried breakfast this morning. When we paid they not only raised the prices but charged 10.99 for my 2 year old which they've never done before. Very annoying because she literally eats one egg. So about $40 later and very small buffet. Most trays were empty. Taco bar was decent, breakfast was decent, and the dessert was very hard and stale. Overall unless you have a coupon I would probably pay extra for a better buffet."}
{"text":"One of the best values left in Vegas.  Can't say enough good things about our server, Jade! As I was taking last sip of iced tea, would look down and there was a fresh glass already there (3 times) -- without ever knowing she had been there. Food is comparable to much more expensive places..."}
{"text":"Really good value for weekday breakfast, in my opinion.  The price is 10 something but if you have a players card (only good for 2 people) they give you a discount, so it ended up being 7 or 8 bucks for a breakfast buffet. The quality was pretty decent and it was convenient because we stayed here.  If we were to drive somewhere and get a meal, would have been 10 bucks easily.  So this made a lot of sense. Key items I repeated were the french toast, eggs benedict, pancake style hash brown.  I didn't want to wait for the omelet line because I was starving.  Will have to check it out next time."}
{"text":"It's decent. They make the same food everyday before the evening time. The Mexican food is pretty good. The dynasty grill let's you pick all the sides and it can be cooked on the grill the way you want. Good price especially with the 2 for 1 deal."}
{"text":"Can't beat the price!  $13 dinner buffet!  The fried chicken was awesome!  Excellent dessert selection.  Lovely ambiance.  My favorite new Vegas Buffet, better deal then the strip buffets, albeit no king crab."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for brunch on Sunday. With the players card the champagne brunch was $10. I repeat $10 for brunch,  non alcoholic beverages,  & champagne (mimosas!).   The breakfast selection was adequate but nothing special. The American cuisine seems average. The other ethnic stations are better, but  I think the Mexican cuisine is the shining star of this buffet. The carnitas was delicious. They had a large selection of items. The items were fresh as this station seems to be the most popular (for good reason).   The service was friendly and attentive.  It's certainly not the most high brow brunch I've ever had, but it was enjoyable and a great value."}
{"text":"I expected a lot more from a casino resort. Place is wack. We came here for lunch and the buffet was cheap 11 bucks for all you can eat but u get what u pay for."}
{"text":"This is a great buffet. The food is all very good quality. We came here on Saturday  night for the prime rib and it was very good. I got a thick cut and the flavoring on the outside was great."}
{"text":"I avoid this place like the plague it is to my digestive system. I have had to eat here a couple times, due to work functions, and I am very sick after each visit. There is always a line outside the door and there are so many people going through touching all the food and children running around, unsupervised. It doesn't have full walls to keep it from the casino, so the cigarette smoke seeps into the restaurant. I really can't say one good thing about this place."}
{"text":"They have a large variety of food, but recently the quality has taken a serious nose dive. We were there last night and there was more fat than meat in my slice of brisket. Disgusting. The potato pancakes were burnt, the biscuits hard as hockey pucks and the only cooked vegetables we could find were beets cooked with apples. Yuck. Even the pecans on my slice of pie were burnt and the filling was dry and rubbery. We will not be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'm rating this based on the really good deal we got. (6.99 per person) = family of four(AYCE for around $35   **this place is ABOVE the casino, so it seems the stinky air goes up the escelator with all the people...    5 stars for the face that the ladies came up to us to help us get a few rewards club card.   *THERE was a long line, from when we got there to when we left!  5 stars for price. (When you're eating with over 25% of the other customers being over the age of 65 years, you've found a good price!)   5 stars for the speed of service. 3 stars for selection  2 stars for quality 1 star for taste of food (some items are super bland)  I had brisket, ham, soft turkey and then the guy made me a flame broiled cheeseburger!)   So, overall, we would probably be back...    This is a CASUAL CHEAP place to eat.  Nothing fancy or exciting, except the price! (Lol)"}
{"text":"I went here last Saturday for lunch for a graduation party.  This place was pretty and spacious.  I really liked the setup as well.  First place I went to was the \"comfort food\" section.  They had mash potatoes, corn on cob, cornbread, bbq chicken and bbq pork.  The bbq pork was the best part.  it was juicy.  The asian food section was ok.  The egg rolls were pretty good.  I was expecting sushi, but no sushi.  They even had a section with  pita bread with dips with deli meats.  I have never seen this kind of section in any buffet.  I thought this was interesting.  They had the normal roast beef, prime rib, and ham.  They also had mongolian bbq.  I was impressed with the comfort food section.  Service was great.  Oh, they had sweet potatoes and the potatoes were huge!"}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly busy on a Monday. We got there around 11:20 am and there was already a line. It took us about 25 minutes to get to the front.   I'd say it's good for the value, especially if you use the coupons/discounts that Station Casinos mail you. We used our 2-for-1 coupon, and our total came out to $9.73.  There are a variety of food types - Asian, American, Tex Mex, and a few others I can't recall. The salad bar is pretty decent, as are the dessert options.   In terms of flavor/quality, it's hit or miss. For example, the chocolate pie I had was pretty good but the pecan pie my husband had was awful. The fried chicken was tasty, but the mac and cheese was flavorless.   I'd recommend it if you want to eat out for cheap."}
{"text":"The Feast Buffet at the Red Rock Casino was offering an $11.99 deal with a players card, what a deal! The selection was very good. They had sushi, shrimp, Chinese, Italian, American, international, BBQ, prime rib, salad bar, deserts, and I am probably missing something.  The quality was good and so was the service.  I would definitely go back. We went early, like 4 pm, and the line was not bad.  It is a great place to stop on the way back from a drive or hike in Red Rock Canyon."}
{"text":"Very reasonable priced las Vegas buffet.  Food is above average nothing impressive but can't complain with price.  Great customer service, were accommodating with special dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"I unfortunately ate here last Thanksgiving. The wait was crazy long... about 2.5 hours. I have to blame my parents for suggesting we eat here. They wanted variety, and while they got that, we also got mediocre food. Going in I knew it wasn't going to be great and my expectations were met with Asian food fitting for Panda Express, flavorless Mexican food, sloppy sushi rolls, bland pasta, and regrettable desserts.  On the plus side, the turkey was really good.  If we have to eat out again for a holiday, I'll have to make sure I choose the location. Sorry mom."}
{"text":"I noticed after this visit just how much the price has changed when it comes to a brunch buffet. Generally brunch costs more than breakfast, lunch or dinner, but not here at the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. Brunch on Sunday runs around $9.99 (same price for dinner during the week) with a players card. After being seated I noticed how dirty the highchair was that my nephew was in. I'm talking all sorts of food on either side of it. I cleaned it up with some wipes his mom had with her, but this highchair looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. Our server was great and checked on us often. Even with the big group we had at our table she kept the dishes cleared and brought us refills without us ever having to ask.   They brunch buffet has the usual stuff. Different breakfast and lunch option at the same time. I walked by the pizza as it was coming out so I figured that was a good time to get some of that. It tasted OK, but definitely tasted like a frozen pizza that was made. They do have a pizza oven right there and you can watch it cook, but it wasn't anything I'd ever go out of my way for. The bacon was hard and tasted microwaved. Scrambled eggs weren't bad or the mini waffle I had. The hash browns were a soggy mess with some burnt crispy parts. I did enjoy the mac & cheese even if it tasted like Kraft deluxe. The breakfast sausage looked good, but tasted nasty. I brought back an assortment of desserts for our table to try and they were terrible! All of the pastries were hard which was a disappointment. I will say that the salad bar had a lot of options including fresh fruit and it all looked good. I enjoyed what I had from the salad bar area much more than anywhere else at the buffet. This buffet could use many changes and isn't really worth it until then in my opinion.   Kids 2 and under are free."}
{"text":"Looks like food but tastes like cardboard with a hint of cigarette ashes.Can't believe that anyone would find this appealing. Just a warning."}
{"text":"This is not a review of the buffet but rather a manager that may or may not have been the buffet manager. In February I donated blood there at a blood drive, as a result, I was given a voucher for a free buffet. I didn't realize it expired. When I spoke with the manager he said he \"could not\" honor it as a one time consideration when I wanted to use it use it 3 days after its expiration. Palace Station may be getting a cosmetic renovation on the outside, but operations continue to turn a downward slide and  a cold shoulder to it's alleged \"valued\" patrons. In an atmosphere declining value for your gambling dollars casino patrons need to consider their options carefully. A free buffet is one of the most common comps and a breakfast buffet the least expensive, that manager let me know my \"value\" as guest of palace station."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst buffet in town. It is over priced for the quality and variety of food. The service leaves much to be desired as well. The employees are simply rude and have no urgency in attending to customers' needs or even show the slightest sign of making sure their customers are taken care of. The ambiance is gloomy, dark and super crowded. It's as if they are too busy that they cramp as many tables in as possible and the employees can't keep up with the demand. We drove to this location from summerlin bc a year ago we went and actually enjoyed it very much and this time we had guests from our of town, and felt embarrassed at what we encountered. Our guests were definitely not impressed either. It's unfortunate that they have declined in so many ways. We won't be going back any time soon and definitely do not recommend it to you. There are many other choices in town."}
{"text":"Been here many times for a $15 buffet. UTS Always Been Just OK But My Kids Love A BUFFWT AND This One Is Just As Good As Any AND THE Price Isn't bad. Last night Friday we waited in line for an hour. When we buy the buffet it came out to $28 per person. And that was the child's price also. I asked why and they said it was Seafood night. Ok well we already stayed in line might as well just eat. As long as it's seafood night I'm sure they will have plenty of ... oh I don't know.... SEAFOOD???? SILLY ME FOR THINKING THAT. Once kids were settled I looked for my food. I asked where the grilled/poached/baked fish was... guess what? Nope... they didn't have any fish. Any type of food was deep fried something. You gotta be kidding me.... seafood buffet but no fish. The only reason why I think the call it seafood is because they have tiny cra b legs and shrimp.  Of course my kids were happy but my wife and I simply ate a salad and a piece of chicken. No Fish on seafood night... oh vay.... we went to movies afterwards and bought a hot dog there."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at this buffet. The food is pretty good with a nice verity. The staff has always been nice and professional. Empty plates are cleared fast and drinks are always topped off."}
{"text":"Cheap food and lots of it.  Like any buffet, some items are better than others. The Feast Buffet at Red Rock is better.   Make sure you are a Stations club member."}
{"text":"One of  my favorite places to visit when in the Aliante area. Price is very reasonable and most importantly, the service is great. I usually go either on a Saturday or Sunday morning, I always ask for my favorite waitress, Letty. She is quick, super friendly and great to all her customers.   Food is good. Again, you have to keep in mind this is a buffet and price is extremely reasonable. In my opinion, their buffet is much better than other breakfast buffets I've tired in town. Always satisfied."}
{"text":"The food selection and taste is great. Wonderful variety of eggs based items, red velvet pancakes and fruit. Service on the other hand simply sucks.  Waiter never came around to check on us and we were basically thirsty throughout our meal.   I'll be speaking to management."}
{"text":"Just another below average buffet at a casino.  Item 1: Rewards person went up and down the isles asking the white people in line if they needed a rewards card while ignoring the colored people (meaning blacks and browns. I'm hispanic and my friends are black) It was extremely disgusting watching this going on in America now a days.  Item 2: People in this buffet line were too comfortable and disregarded personal space.  Item 3: Sat us in the back next to the staff entrance and bathroom exit as if there weren't any other tables available. (There were, I checked).  Item 4: The waiter simply took our drink order, fulfilled it and never came back to check on us. We were the ones that had to call him over or one of the other waiters several times in order to get refills or napkins. (Mind you we only had a party of 4)  Item 5: We noticed that when his friends, family or relatives came in he was at their every beck and call. Not trying to be mean but I don't think employees are supposed to wait on acquaintances.   This concludes today's review. I won't be coming back to this establishment.  Oh, and I hope they switch out that bacteria infested rag they use to clean the seats and tables."}
{"text":"This buffet is located inside the Red Rock Hotel, Spa, and Casino. I came here several times  over the years. If you have a boarding pass (which you can sign up for free) you get a discount. The drinks are also included.  There was a wide variety of food to choose from such as Mexican, Italian, Asian, America, etc. They have a huge desert selection.  The food is ok for the great variety for such a decent value."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast and signed up for this casino card and paid 6.99 each. For the price, it was a decent buffet. The omlet was good, the red velvet pancake was good as well. The salad bar had lots of stuff to choose from. I'll probably come back again"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm starving, decide to hit the buffet up. I'm waiting and waiting waiting... 45 minutes later finally pay.   Go to the buffet, not impressed. All my food in my first plate was COLD ! Coconut shrimp cold, fried chicken cold, mash potatoes cold. With all the people in here and how long I had to wait (STARVING) and paying 19.99 per person. I half expect the food to be good. Wasn't even that. The cold shrimp they had was SLIMY! Not to mention their so call \"sushi\" had a roll of just tomato and avocado. COME ON PEOPLE, is that even sushi??? Get some better sushi standards.   Wait there's more ! So finally after looking through the buffet I asked for the manager, politely I explained how disappointed I am, after the wait, explained about the cold food etc, he was NOT sympathetic WHAT SO EVER. Did not apologize once ! Just talked on his talkie in his ear and said we'll take care of that.   So whatever, I go back look at the roast beef and decide I'll give this a try, well the guy gives me a huge nasty dry slice of it and I'm done, nothing looks good. Everything is dry and it's obvious they don't rotate their food. Their food quality is terrible and so is their customer service.   The only person who apologize was the cashier when she refunded our money. Teach is own! Never going there again! Want to warn everyone before they waste their money. If there were a no star option this would definitely be it. Thanks for not only wasting my time but having my whole family leave hungry."}
{"text":"Ok so a 40 dollar cab ride on a very special night. Havent seen my son in a year.  Was supposed to be top 10. I've had better prime rib at best Western. No crab legs which the rating is based on management was unsympathetic. Only decent guy was john our waiter who kept serving us even after I told him don't bother no tip was coming. This place sucks. One star is generous considering the experience they provide."}
{"text":"Compared to the Sunset Station's buffet across town, this sister property should be embarrassed.  The line moved VERY slowly and once inside the food was a big step down from the other buffets in town.   Will avoid in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast buffet , lots of choices, and on senior Wednesday it's a real steal at about 2 for 6 bucks.  We liked it so much we tried the \"Palace Station\" buffet next morning but that one was horrendous."}
{"text":"The all you can eat crab legs on weekends is a must try item.  Pick up a plate of cold crab legs, go to the cooking station on the right side, and they cook the crab legs with garlic, green onions, etc. They tasted so good. You can ask for spicy or mild."}
{"text":"Me and my husband come every Friday night for seafood night because $20 for all you can eat crab is a great price considering how fresh it always is! And their ice cream bar has about 10 different flavors of scooped ice cream and  they are delicious!"}
{"text":"We come here and sunset alot!!! Usually a good experience but this time there was a roach crawling down the back of the booth side I was on. I jumped and grabbed a napkin but didn't get it and immediately asked to be moved. My appetite was gone, they were sorry and would call \" ecolab sanitation\" according to the manager. She did briefly apologize but we're left alone immediately...just waited for my kids to eat dessert... Thanks but no thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day with my mom and her friend. The price was $19.99 using the Player's card which I signed up for at the register before paying.  That saved $5.  I haven't been to too many buffets so I considered this fairly large, but I think the set up is good and the identification of the different food sections like Italian, sushi, American, Asian, desserts, etc., is very clear.  Everything I tried was pretty tasty minus the shrimp, which I though was mushy, and the prime rib was overcooked. Best buffet pizza I've ever had though.  Being that it was my first time I didn't realize mimosas or champagne were included until half way through so that would have been nice if the waiter had given us the head's up on that.  I thought all drinks were extra as they were displayed at the register and also on the menu at our table with prices.  Being that I live so close and the normal price for Sunday brunch is $13.99 I would come back on a non holiday when the service is probably better.  ."}
{"text":"Worst Buffet out of all stations this place had little items to choose from the cooked food to order very bland and the employees lack customer service  I Will not come back to this location and I advise you to not even waste your money or time with this buffet"}
{"text":"Buffet not worth coming please be advised of cold food it's a disgrace for the station family to have this place be that empty of item for a buffet"}
{"text":"Although nothing special, it has lots of variaty and such a great deal.  The food is fresh and the place is clean, new and pleasant.  They have to do so being so out of the way from the strip.  Not worth driving there though, unless you have another reason to be near the west end of the city."}
{"text":"Just like any other buffet. Came on a Friday night and was hoping for a seafood special. Nope. Shrimp and some fish were the extent of it. My friend had some sort of discount which knocked five dollars off, so that made things better."}
{"text":"There are certainly a lot of people who think that Red Rock is one of the best local casinos in town and I will admit that it had a lot going for it.   That is, it HAD a lot going for it.   Over the past two years I have watched as this once great Red Rock has slowly soured into a joke that is not at all funny. There seems to be no aspect of this casino that has not deteriorated in quality, with the rare exception of the Yard House (which is not associated with the casino).  But let's keep the focus of this review to the Feast Buffet. I have eaten at the Feast Buffet on a very regular basis for several years, although it had been a few months since I was last there. With some friends in town, it was a good option for a good budget meal, so we went this past Sunday.  First of all, I am supposed to be a VIP of the Station Casinos, with a Presidential status that was earned almost completely at the Red Rock. The President status is supposed to get me a 50% discount on the buffet, but it only amounted to about 25%.   So the Sunday night buffet is $19 per person ($15 after my VIP discount). One would think at those prices, we were about to be pampered with some great food choices.   Boy were we wrong - very wrong.  Let's just sum this all up with a reference that I think we can all relate to - the food quality and choice was what one would expect to find at Sizzler (but of course, at twice the price).   There were less options to choose from than there used to be and what was there was crap, just pure crap. No prime rib, shrimp or crab legs, something they were calling sushi (ha!) and a plentiful collection of some of the cheapest menu items a buffet can offer.   It reminded us of a cattle feed lot, troughs of a food like substance that all tastes the same.  Crap - pure crap!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in this buffet. There was no dish that was that good. A lot of bland and flavorless options. Spend the extra few dollars and go to Green Valley Ranch."}
{"text":"Your Typical Station Casino Buffet set up....nice decor, but slim pickings on the food items...same food items were placed at the BBQ and carving stations, salad bar was pretty mediocre, and a lot of food items had that \"sitting on the buffet line too long and needed to be changed out\" look.   Of all the Station Casinos, the ones at Green Valley Ranch and Red Rock are your better bets. don't waste your time with the others...ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Can't beat the price.  Good food.  We go here 2 or 3 times a week.  Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"No lines, great food, and reasonable price. Sounds like 4stars to me. My only issue was the American section, the food lacked love. It was a little bland and could use some seasoning, but thats a personal preference thing."}
{"text":"Standing in line....for an hour......hour & a half now....now two hours, and finally got a table. Now off to the line to get crab legs, yes a line, then with my plate of legs I move into the line to get the legs cooked in a yummy Cajun style seasoning, so after a total of waiting too many hours & too many minutes to count I finally got to eat my crab legs. While the wait was beyond toooooooooooooo long, they were quite tasty! But the rest of the buffet food was plain ole mediocre $10.00 buffet food!!!!!! While the price laid was $25 per person. I would not recommend this place unless you come on Fridays for the crab legs. P.S our server/waiter wasn't looking to thrilled to be working there, no smiles, no welcoming chit chat, just nothing at all."}
{"text":"DOWN HILL! 100 miles an hour.  With no brakes.    HEALTH DEPARTMENT NO NO! Many of the cooks on the line have beards I'm not talking about a a little facial hair,  I'm talking about beards ... beards that you could put a comb through.  SEE PICTURE.  I brought it up to the attentions of someone who is supposedly in charge who also had a beard that they were not wearing any type of net around their facial hair they are very irritated when asked if that was against health code he said yes and for the hour that remained we observed them NOT fixing the issue. I can only imagine having their facial hair falling into the meat that they're slicing ... the potatoes that they're cooking or the pans of food that they're refilling.  Quite frankly the longer we watched the more disgusted we were... so then we decided to see if we ever saw anybody wash their hands and on the whole line or change gloves since we had a front-row seat ... the answer is no - in an entire hour did NOT see it from all of the people up and down the line ... now maybe we missed one, but with that many cooks and not seeing it happen not one time.  Then there was a COOK who is in The Carving Station who on his right forearm had such a large gash or burn and was exposed... approximately 4 inches long and an inch wide that look like it was oozing from infection not covered obviously ... plain to the view... as he sliced your food it was disgusting.  Local that has eaten here since it opened.  While still better than most if not all off-strip casino buffets let's evaluate what it was ... to what it has become.    $60 for Friday seafood buffet.  Last 4 visits in 4 months terrible.  No line or small one if you come before 7pm.  Crab legs small and LOADED WITH SALT.  So bad I got ill after one experience from too much salt intake.  All 4 times prime rib bloody raw, not medium rare or rare, just to plain raw. Not because of a line of a lot of people  and had to pull it out early.... several times it was early in the dinner and the restaurant was two-thirds empty and anybody ordering prime rib had to have it put on a grill just to make it edible. This is not what we pay this kind of money for to have prime rib thrown on the Grill just so you can eat it without gagging.  Note I order everything medium rare and have my whole life so for me to think that this is bad it is. This is not quality driven.  The famous chicken noodle soup which I have always thought to be one of the best, if not the best at any restaurant I've eaten in 20 years in Las Vegas ... I eat out at least 4 times a week... it has changed. Clearly the recipe has changed or there's a new person in charge of making the chicken soup.  I don't know if they've changed their chicken base or if they've changed the recipe altogether but now it is watered down and has absolutely no memorable flavor or taste at all ... a beautiful looking soup that tastes bland and like water.  Desserts are crap. resorting to a chocolate chip cookie because of all of the desserts looking so dried out with a very small selection to begin with... was probably worse than grabbing the dried up offerings they had... the cookie broke apart like shattered glass.   I've always thought their desserts needed some sprucing up but with close examination they were all old and dried up and the sad end to a disappointing meal all together.  Do you know that they don't even have one cake as a dessert other than their terrible-looking carrot cake.   Sincerely,   A local neighbor, regular customer,  who is grossed out and has given you the benefit of the doubt 4 times in a row and this last one was a real doozy."}
{"text":"Burned pancakes, burned hash browns, burned biscuits, scrambled eggs sitting in an inch of water. How the hell do you serve Crap like this?  Placing tables on the carpet to tile threshold, just to place more tables. Who hired the Manager that made this decision. Probably related to the Executive Chef that is letting this type of food to be served!  Frank and Lorenzo Ferttita are really putting their names on this?"}
{"text":"Denied Boarding Pass Discount because my players card was expired. An expired players card? Really? Considering every other Stations Property accepts it AS DO THE MACHINES THAT TAKE MY MONEY, yet a Cashier, someone that is supposed to represent the Customer Service level established by the Ferttita's, denies it like it is a credit card. Yeah, you are actually going to make me go get another card, for a Dollar discount.  So I went and purchased my Breakfast and made my sports bets at another Casino!  I well NEVER come to Sunset Station again to spend a dime. Im sure the Management doesnt give a shit as they wont miss my money, so Ive been told."}
{"text":"Am I in Las Vegas Buffet Heaven? A wonderland of different foods, all look so freshly cooked. And it's so damn clean in here! I have been to pretty much every buffet I can find in Las Vegas; when I travel here my priority is to eat well and gamble often. I walked into the Red Rock Feast Buffet, unknowingly right before dinner, and noticed my receipt immediately - 11.99 per person!! This place is easily as good as any buffet in Vegas. In fact, it's now my favorite based on value. I highly recommend eating here, I'm really satisfied and have found a new Vegas favorite spot to play slots and chow down."}
{"text":"Great location, great buffet, great food and great service.you just can't go wrong dining at the palace station feast buffet."}
{"text":"Located in the Palace Station,  this is the second time I've been here.  First time was after I had just gotten married and this time,  3 kids later.  Nothing much has changed. Food is standard buffet fare.  Definitely on the lower quality side.  They have the salads, soups,  pizza,  fried chicken,  burgers and dogs. They also do have the meat carving station. All in all, not impressive. There are many other places that serve better buffet food."}
{"text":"Well we used to be regulars here but the quality and choice of offerings has gone way down hill. Roast beef served small and extra extra DRY, without even a smile. Now it feels more like a school dinner line than a nice buffet. We will give it some time to get back to how it used to be. I recommend that the F&B manager samples the food."}
{"text":"Still my favorite buffet in las vegas,  exceptional service, great king crab, prime rib, sushi, chilled shrimp cocktail,  made to order habd rolls & salads."}
{"text":"Came here for the breakfast buffet with my boyfriend. We saw it listed in one of the Worth It videos from Buzzfeed and thought to give it a try. I mean, for the price, how could we not?  Not too much of a variety for breakfast foods. If you're really into the traditional breakfast items like eggs, bacon, ham, omelets, pancakes, waffles, cereal, etc., you'll have no problem here. There were random taco stations, and a dessert station setup, but I mean it was what it was.  Taste of food was average--not horrid, but not fantastical or amazing. My favorite was probably the sliced ham and the bacon. The hash was a little disappointing, but the tacos made up for it. I thought the omelette station was a nice touch, and seemed to be the highlight during this visit as the line was ridiculously long.  I would say that this is a great place to bring a group of people to fill up before hitting the strip to counter some of that booze. Also a good place if you happen to be on travel with your family--saw lots of families eating together while dining. I mean, the price is right, so you can't go terribly wrong with saving some moolah. Just keep in mind that what you pay for is what you get."}
{"text":"We were at the Palace Station ... the food and service were terrible.  We have eaten at Feast Buffets at Red Rock, Green Valley, Sunset Station, and Santa Fe and they have all been good.  This place was by far the worst.  Meat dishes were dry and tough.  Selection was very poor.  The kitchen staff sounded like they were having a fight with the pots and pans.  We will not return to this place.  It was really terrible."}
{"text":"It was alright but not exceptional... we may not return... there are other places that are just as good"}
{"text":"Not as good as I expected.  Food was bland and meat was tough.  Server was good but seemed to be rushing us"}
{"text":"We drive across town to eat here ... the last two times when we went there for lunch, they have been out of ham ... Telling me that they are cooking it ... How can a big-time buffet be out of ham at noon.  I don't know who is doing the planning but they need to get their act together ... I think we will eat closer the the NW side of town from now on"}
{"text":"Aliante - Not at all impressed.  It seemed unorganized from the cashier to seating, to getting my food."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience ever. The manager at this place was extremely rude to us. She treated us like dirt."}
{"text":"-- I came here for a buffet last year, heard about it from the locals.   This buffet place does not have a lot of seafood and crab legs for the evening buffet, but the price reflects it as well.. only $18/pp.   all I can say is, it's good, alright, but not worth the calories for me to come here again... I think I'd rather skip buffet next time, unless it's at a top casino/hotel for the delicate buffets."}
{"text":"First off, very horrible door service, as in they are not organized at all about how they seat their customers. My party of three was in line for an hour. We were asked to move lines for some reason, so we followed. We thought we would have the opportunity to be seated faster. I was wrong. All parties in front of us as well as six parties behind us (in the previous line) were seated before us. Mind you, the parties were both larger and smaller than my party. The staff DID NOT know how to handle a rush. Two stars because the food saved this review."}
{"text":"The Aliante buffet has improved a lot since being apart from the Station Casinos.  The quality of the food has improved and the workers seem to be more service oriented.  It's a good value for the food you get."}
{"text":"This is definitely not somewhere I would recommend anyone going to. I had dinner there today and it was $14.00 which includes a soft drink with refills. The restaurant has an awful smell of old cooking oil and the food was over cooked. I had a piece of sushi and the rice was as hard as rock. Within 5 minutes of being home after having dinner there I threw up. Stay away this place is disgusting."}
{"text":"Over the years I've sampled my fair share of the breakfast buffets in Las Vegas.  I used to bank on the fabulous eats at the Paris buffet - that is, until I first tried the Feast Buffet at the Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa.  Why five stars?  First, I guess I got tired of the lines for the breakfast buffets on the strip.  If you wanted to eat at the Paris breakfast buffet, or any other breakfast buffet on the strip that I've tried over the years, in that magic hour when your breakfast price transitions to lunch time food, and during the busy holiday season between Christmas and New Years, well, good luck.  You would have to be in line by 9am and hope to get in by 11.  At the Feast Buffet, even if you slept in and don't get into the line until 10:45am, you will still get seated within about 30 minutes, and they continue to charge only the breakfast price.  Which brings me to...  Second, the price.  If you take the time to go to customer service and get a \"station casino\" card, the breakfast buffet is only $6.99.  I repeat, $6.99.  That includes your drinks (I usually get both coffee and the orange juice) and all the food you can eat.  Which brings me to...  Third, the food, the food, the food.  I don't know about other times of day, but at the breakfast buffet I am astounded by the choices, starting with, natch, the omelet station, and running the gamut from fruit, cereal, meats, cheeses, pasta, Asian, etc, etc, etc.  Which brings me to...  Fourth, the quality of the food.  If you observe the staff, they are constantly refreshing the food.  For example, the fruit bowls remain topped up, the desserts always look scrumptious, the sushi never looks picked over, the omelets taste really good (do they use fresher ingredients???  Cook them better???).  Now, I have not, thank goodness for my waistline, tried everything, but everything I have tried has been delicious.  Fifth (finally) is the Red Rock Casino itself.  It is quite new and when they built it they obviously considered the ventilation system (along with the rest of the beautiful decor).  So, you can sit in the wonderful ambiance of the Feast Buffet and enjoy the high ceilings and wonderful artistic details without smelling or seeing cigarette smoke.  It just doesn't seem to drift around the casino the way it does in many places.    Bottom line, I go there every chance I get for breakfast.  The meal is a deal from a pocketbook perspective, as well as a food quantity, choice, and quality perspective.  Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, $7.99 breakfast, couple bucks more for \"nicer Station\" with fancy decor. Ordinary food, a couple exotics, omelette station."}
{"text":"Best manager ever!! Barbie had great service, and we didn't even need a manager. Great food as well."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Affordable as well! Great menu selection. Wouldn't change a thing really."}
{"text":"Food was decent but given it is a buffet that is to be expected. Good price for locals, salad bar and desserts are the best!"}
{"text":"It was alright. Unlimited mimosa is awesone though. Food was nothing special. Roast beef is memorably dry."}
{"text":"They're brunch is potentially great food wise but the services is a mess. The buffet brunch is a bottomless mimosa however we've had 3 different serves from the time we've been seated and each have had a different policy on the mimosas if they acknowledged us at all. We finally got water about 15 minutes into being seated. The servers literally fight for the tips, all three servers have taken a tip from our table and brought one round each. We've paid $16 total in tips total today. Take your money to a different station casino buffet."}
{"text":"Wow where do I begin almost speechless on this one!!!   So I use to work concierge for Palace Station and had got to work early so I decided to breakfast at their buffet.   What a MISTAKE!   BIG TIME YUCKO!!!   So I went for breakfast at like 7am so food should be fresh and delicious I'm thinking it should be. I tried their nasty watery runny eggs omg I almost threw up!   I also tried their extra crispy burned bacon I think it cut my throat going down! So last and just as least as the other items I tried their oatmeal because I figured how can you mess up oatmeal well Palace Station was successful at messing that up to!   I think I would of had a better dining experience eating out of their dumpster! Yes it was extremely cheap in price but come on I don't expect to go to a Station Casino and eat dog food!   Please I beg of you NEVER EAT HERE!   Note: Service is awful the server made me feel like I was inconveniencing her when I asked for a refill on coffee then rolled her eyes when I ordered a chocolate milk! WOW Sorry to have disturbed you DOING YOUR JOB!!!"}
{"text":"If I were to be making a vegan list of Las Vegas (which I kind of am). This buffet would be on my vegan do not go list. While some buffets gave decent side dish options, Green Valley does not.  This buffet has lowered its price for January and gotten rid of its crab legs (wooo!). It seems as though they are strained with M being so close and that buffet being better. Even if I wasn't vegan, I still would not want to eat here, not much looked very appetizing and the service was a bit sub par.  I was here a few years ago and it was better then, there were a few tofu dishes. At the mongolian gril station a few years ago the cook got tofu from the back and made something with separate utensils. No luck this time. There are only meat options at the grill and they won't use separate utensils for meat and veggie. I mean, seriously, how hard is it to have a little tofu kicking about and 2 pairs of tongs? Really?  The Bok Choy in the asian section was super overcooked and gross. The salad bar was a bit disappointing too. Really the only thing to eat as a vegan was veggie chow mein which had very few veggies. Pretty disappointing if you ask me. I will be very happy if I don't have to eat here again."}
{"text":"Always a good place for breakfast. Now dont get me wrong its the same thing over and over again but if you want the traditional eggs and some form of swine. This is a decent place for breakfast. Lunch and dinner have been ok as well. You can't beat $7.99 for breakfast. We joked around saying for that price you'd be lucky to get a decent meal at McDonalds. Oh and servers here have always been super nice and has helpful as possible for the amount of people they handle. A good fall back place for the days you can't decide what you want."}
{"text":"This is probably the best buffet on the west side of town for the price. It's $13.99 for dinner with players card that they give you for free. It's buy one get one free for military on Mondays. The food selection is excellent and the quality of the food is good for a buffet. They recently added creamed spinach, bourbon corn and rice with chicken and mushrooms ( it's kind of like a risotto ). Also they have a variety of deserts and the coffee is a good quality."}
{"text":"The food quality has gone downhill here over the last 5 years as the price has gone up. The customer service from management sucks. You might as well be talking to an AT&T rep trying to get a problem fixed. They just don't care. Also, be sure to be early for cutoff times. I had 10 people in front of me to pay at 3:35 and I made it to the cashier at 4:02 and they said, sorry, prices went up at 4pm. The cashiers here are always super slow and there is always a problem with someone paying that takes 5 or 10 or 15 minutes.  I'm taking this buffer off my list. Redrock has better quality food. They started closing from 3pm-4pm so if you want to get in lunch at Redrock be sure you're in line by 2pm or just go somewhere else. Their cashiers are much faster but their line is usually really long"}
{"text":"The food was very dry, luke warm, and rough. I filled out a comment card and described the same exact comments. I put for a member of management to email me and a week later nothing. I figured they were too busy with phones and email you can also reach someone, incase I wasn't home when they called. You would think being a platinum member which is 3rd from top that you would get some response. I hate if someone was gold or a new member. There are plenty casinos here in Vegas, maybe time for me to give my money someplace else."}
{"text":"Staff is nice and helpful and I can always find something to eat even though I'm a vegetarian.  On busy days you can wait awhile in line though."}
{"text":"Paid for unlimited mimosas only to be told by our waitress Tess that we were cut off after 3!  Line was long, food was mediocre and service was horrible. First and last time here."}
{"text":"The buffet is fair.  It doesn't have a lot of food  choices compared with strip hotels, but the price is good, less than $10 for lunch buffet. All you can eat prime ribs & shrimps at Saturday night."}
{"text":"the food was not impressive and the service was terrible.   we were there for an hour and the only time our waitress offered anything was when we sat down. we were never offered refills and never once did she stop by to check on us. we had to stop 2 different waitresses to ask where ours was. One said she would find her then never returned. the other ended up serving us herself. by the end, we asked for coffee then i was so irritated i changed my mind and we got up to ask for a manager.   as we were waiting for her the waitress who got us the coffee looked at us, we apologized for wating her time then she walked away rolling her eyes. i dont know what her deal was but i followed right behind her to a table she was serving and made sure she saw me read her name tag then i walked away.  the manager finally came and we explained everything. she was GREAT. she knew how to handle upset customers, understood the problem and made sure everything was taken care of. She even offered a refund for the meal but said she would prefer we take a voucher for a free buffet instead so they could have a second chance.  i have yet to go back, but even the manager on duty said to make sure we request to NOT have the same waitresses we did this time.  as of now, im not impressed."}
{"text":"The fresh chef made shrimp scampi was so good. The burger was also pretty good. If you have a players club card it's $9.98 but without $17.99 . They will even send the lady up to the counter to register you a new players card so you can recieve the discount"}
{"text":"Poor selection of food, decore old,  way to bright."}
{"text":"Had breakfast this morning at the buffet, it was 9am. The bacon was not  even cooked and it was sitting in grease.  We have breakfast with a group three times a week, and maybe, the bacon will be cooked properly once during the three times! So, this morning, of course it was not cooked. Does any one ever check if there is a problem with the food that is offered? Why is it so inconsistent? We will be back again to determine if we should complain again."}
{"text":"I've been to this buffet two times now, and both times I really loved it. First of all, it's huge. There are all of these different stations you can go to, including Asian, Italian, and International cuisine (why they can't just say Mexican, I don't know). They have really good churros at the International station - we picked one up for each of our trips to the buffet. I think I like it most because it's spaced out well and you don't have to wait forever in line to get some food, even when the place is really busy. The salad bar is a little small, with the cheese on the other side (I didn't notice this, however, until later) with the fruits, so I thought that was sort of strange, but for the most part, I really like this place.  While my last visit to Sunset Station was great, this one ended with the worst stomach ache of my life - something must not have agreed with me. But I still like it. We were debating on going here again or trying out the Palms, but after yelping the Palms, we were convinced this would likely be a better choice. It's not too expensive, either. We went to the information booth to get \"boarding passes\", which gave us $2 savings at the buffet (boy are we cheap), so it cost each of us $12.00.   I really like how there is no smoking in the buffet itself, so that's a definite plus. It's super clean and the staff are surprisingly friendly. Oh! And check out the desserts...there is so much to choose from. Best buffet I've had in Vegas...but I guess that's not saying much since the last one I can remember going to was at Circus Circus (not a good idea) - but still really good!"}
{"text":"I'm not much into buffets anymore since I am eating small but frequent meals.  I was in town for business & my client suggested meeting here for a working lunch.  I'm like, whatever, it's sustenance.  After we sat down with our 1st plate, I made the observation that many of the diners are older folks.  Well, he said Summerlin has plenty of seniors & this casino seems to be \"the local hangout\" for them.  And why not? The food wasn't bad.  I've been to worse buffets in Vegas that charge similar and higher than $8.99 for lunch."}
{"text":"Located 30 minutes west of the strip in the Red Rock Casino is the Feast Buffet. And a feast it is!! This is one tasty, well appointed, clean buffet. I can't think of one thing that didn't taste good. We went for lunch and it was very crowded but service and food item availability surprisingly excellent!  Excellent weekday pricing (with players card), Breakfast under $7.50, Lunch $9, Dinner $14"}
{"text":"Stayed at Red Rock Casino and Hotel.  Decided against driving into the strip for dinner so we opted to eat and try their buffet.  The price was reasonable and with the players card you get a discount.  I was impressed with the selection and pretty good quality of food.  I would definitely visit the buffet again the next time I stay at the hotel."}
{"text":"Suprised and amazed all at the same time. This buffet is very delicious and well prepared. We have been coming here alot lately instead of eating out for fast food. The price is great and affordable. The only thing I didn't like we when my in laws came out we had to pay extra gratuity for all of us to sit together. But all in all this place is the best buffet in town. Here at Texas station. Not the other feast buffets just this one"}
{"text":"I am not sure why there was a long line to get into this place! I'm writing this while my stomach is still reeling from last nights meal. I got a 2 for 1 deal in the mail, so my husband and I decided to check it out and now I am sorry we did. The staff was okay and the person bringing us drinks was prompt, but it seems like everyone was in a bad mood and no one was happy to be working there. I should have taken a few cues while waiting in line when one employee brought another one prepackaged snacks to eat because obviously they don't trust the food either and that most of the patrons were twice my age probably just here to use their players points/coupons. I had items mostly from the asian section. Sweet sour chicken had a texture that wasn't chicken and had obviously been sitting out for waaaayyyy to long. Vegetable spring rolls were just mush. I couldn't finish the bbq rib as it was mostly fat. Pot stickers were ok but cold. In fact, none of the food was hot. About the only thing that has half way decent was the fried shrimp which was more batter than shrimp. I had a piece of sausage from the carving station which was more like a glorified hotdog. Fried catfish had lots of skin hidden under the batter. I decided that I was over the dinner selection and went to desserts. Eclairs were ok, but dried out. The sugarfree cheesecake had hardly any taste to it. I'm glad we only paid half price and we won't be back until the food quality improves."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed when we went to the Sunset Station's Feast Buffet last Thursday. My new favorite dish has been the Street Tacos (fish) on our last several visits. When I found that they had discontinued them, and deep fried pickle slices were sitting where they were, I couldn't believe it. I had been getting a little bored with the buffet, eating there over the years-- very few surprises. The tacos were such a great addition. Now they're gone.There are so many dishes they could eliminate and keep the tacos. Also, now the desserts are in an enclosed case, which is pretty annoying having to wait for someone to help you. I imagine it really cut down on the desserts taken, as no one wants to get more than one for fear of looking like a glutton. Sunset's buffet went from one of my favorites to one I'm not so crazy about anymore. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Overpriced, you can get a card if you give them marketing information on yourself saving you 5 dollars but is that worth it?  Selection is standard at a buffet like this or perhaps slightly lower.  If you've gluten allergies go elsewhere entirely. Selection is extremely limited for the price of 12.99 and the only \"gluten free\" section involves standing in line where they cook eggs to order so you can get your food to just then get back out of line.  Unless I ate only fruit this is all that remains for me to eat."}
{"text":"Terrible attitudes all the way around the brisket was 80 percent fat the fried rice was hard and the carrots in it we're still cold the Mexican station has really gone down hill in the last couple months along with the rest of the food we got there at 4:50 and most of the stuff looked like it had been sitting out since right after breakfast the BBQ tastes like something a 10 year old bad cook made in the oven the clam chowder was watery and Luke warm over all a horrible experience mind you we've been going to this buffet every Friday for the last three months and every time just gets worse and worse when I asked for a refund the management was really rude and when I told her the issues I had she kept telling me well that's the way it's supposed to be really!?!! And even after she refunded the money which will take 7 to 10 days to be refunded kept saying well the chqitos or whatever they're called are supposed to be hard \"just so you know\" like I'm dumb or something I felt like going off on her but there was a lot if people at that point trying to pay for their food and I didn't want to run their experience maybe some people like tasteless food and crappy bbq but not me I don't think they will be getting my business any more in the future I could have probably gone to the homeless soup kitchen and had better service and food that's how terrible it was I should have known better considering the place has about 25 tables with people and it's Friday at dinner time I wish I would have taken a picture of you all to see how much fat to meat ratio the brisket had I can't believe the way the manager acted she should have said I'm sorry I'll go check in everything but she didn't she just kept saying that's the way it's supposed to be \"just so you know\" I know the way this is supposed to taste and its not supposed to taste like THAT! Yuk YUK YUK"}
{"text":"The food at the buffet is absolutely fantastic. Customer service is great and there's never much of a line. My girlfriend and I always enjoy our entire experience here. We highly recommend it to everybody."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Food was cold and bland.  Salad bar not many choices and no low fat dressings  The carrot cake was good that is why at least 2 stars"}
{"text":"Let me start by praising the staff! Melanee is superb! She is friendly, answered all my questions about the buffet before we decided to eat there. She kept lines moving, loved her!  I didn't catch the wait staff name but he was good too. Always had the refills ready to go, took the used plates promptly and every time I saw him he was smiling.   The buffet food was good! The setup is kinda wacky, but I tried something from every station and all of it was good.    Get the players cards for discounts and some sites like hotel.com offer free breakfast buffets with your room here."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars for the buffet @ Green Valley** I went here for dinner on Christmas eve and it was such a amazing value (just under $20). I do agree with my sister that it's not as good as it used to be but still great for the price. We had a late lunch/early dinner and there was prime rib, pasta, chicken, salad, veggies, fruit, potatoes, ice cream, cheesecake, cake, cookies, and more! My favorite dish they had was the linguine and clams. There's also an Asian station and noodle bar. Unfortunately, the noodles they use now are really thin and fall apart easily. They used to have the thick chow mein but they got rid of it. They really need to bring it back! I also miss the crab legs which have now been replaced with fruit. :( Overall, a pretty good experience with excellent service and lots of food options to choose from."}
{"text":"First time here. Long line but what do you expect for a $16 buffet. It actually was pretty good. The four of us liked the majority of our brunch food. Service could have been a little better. And maybe they should consider moving the plates. They're at knee level under the food so if there's a line you have to wait to get a plate or squeeze in between their legs. Lol.   Putting the plates aside and service, Brunch was good and cheap. Use your money to play the machines or go to nearby shopping stores outlets."}
{"text":"\"The Adventure Continues.\"  We'll start this review as we're standing in line waiting to be seated. We paid $20.00 for our meals which is nice. Being seated went by quick. We were told we would be seated as soon as a table would be available. Now we were told as soon as a table would be available, but half the dining room was empty. Table availability or just understaffed?  Food was par for the course as far as buffets in Las Vegas go. Plain and simple some are better as others. The salads we created were ok.  Fran, my wife, had a cherseburger and a tamales. Both were fine, but the tamale was small in size.  I had a few soft tacos with rice pilaf. Taco meat was average at best. Rice pilaf was bland. I then had a slice of turkey, green beans, mashed potatoes without gravy and cornbread. Again average as far as buffets in Las Vegas go. One item I felt was better than average, the corbread. I had four of them in all.  For dessert Fran had German chocolate cake and carrot cake.  According to her both were pretty dry to the taste.  I had ice cream, and a red velvet cupcake. The cupcake is so small it only takes one or two bites before it's gone.  The buffet itself is small in size. I felt cramped waiting in line for a table. I would imagine at night during dinner the place to be crowded as well. The serving area is small and easily crowded.  As I write this review Palace Station is undergoing a large renovation process.  Hopefully Feast Buffet will be expanded on.  In closing I would like to add that I used to work for Station Casinos in the Wildfire devision. One of the service standards is to \"Let them hear you smile.\" Seems all but one person forgot how to do this.  Another service standard is called the \"10-5 Rule\".  If you are within 10 feet of a person, smile. If you are within 5 feet of a person,  say hello, at least acknowledge the person you are close to. A person who looked to be management forgot how to do this. How about the \"Fond Farewell\" standard? Pretty self explanatory to me. Not to the cashiers as we were leaving, except for the same staff member mentioned earlier. Everyone else was talking among themselves.  Okay I've rambled on enough. You all have a nice day. As a pastor and dear friend of mine says, \"The Adventure Continues.\""}
{"text":"Good buffet for the price.  Aliante is slightly better.  Great place to pig out if very hungry.  Good selection.  They have crayfish on Friday nights----not as good as The Orleans. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Good buffet.  Typical food selection.  Better food than Santa Fe Station buffet. Will come back again."}
{"text":"We arrived arrived on a Friday, around 11:30 am - 12:00 noon with only a few people in line before us. Some days you could wait quite some time before entering the buffet.  Once we were seated, we (myself, wife and two daughters under the age of ten) ordered our drinks. Once drinks were ordered the ladies were off to get their food. The older of the kids said that she wanted Asian food for lunch. I don't care for Asian so we decided on a Buffet. We decided to eat here inside the Red Rock Hotel, Spa, and Casino.   The girls soon returned with their egg rolls and noodles. the younger also had a slice of pizza along with macaroni and cheese on her plate.   Myself, I first went to the salad bar. I did not find any sliced carrots at the salad bar. SHOCKING ! I found the bacon bits over in the barbecue station. Ohh barbecue. Since I am at the barbecue station let's fill up my plate.  We were seated in the very southwest corner of the dining area. For my second plate I wanted some green chili verdi, so I walked all the way to the northeast corner of the buffet stations. Not a quick walk. But worth it.  The reason for only 4 stars, service was slow. Between trips to and from the buffet I had to ask my server for a refill of soda twice. Which to me is a pet peeve when going out to eat.   Bottom line this is what you do in Las Vegas when you can't decide on what style of food you want. BUFFET! The one's on the strip are okay, and I will post reviews on them, but Red Rock Casino has 1 of my 3 favorites. It's on the very west side of town and worth the effort to get there."}
{"text":"When it comes to Las Vegas eating at a Buffet is a must.  But please, do not expect these buffets to have everything.  Not all of them have Alaskan Steamed Crab Legs. Not all of them will serve Mongolian BBQ.  Come to think of it I need to compose a top 20 list of Las Vegas Buffets and how I think they should rank, best to worst.  The Feast Buffet at Santa Fe Station, good decent service, good decent food, even Beef Brisket. I prefer the Feast Buffets at Red Rock Station and Texas Station. But if you are in the extreme Northwest area of Las Vegas, i.e. about to leave the city, check out the Feast Buffet for great selections of good, decent food."}
{"text":"Kindof pricey but it was crableg night. Only thing is I don't eat crabmeat. The chicken was good. The server took forever to offer drink refills."}
{"text":"Good food bit so ridiculous that you charge full price for a two year old that has a slice of pizza and an ice cream cone, last time I take my family, Shame On You Green Valley for allowing that to,happen."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and it was gross. Nice staff but not good food. The only thing I liked was the bacon and the ice cream. Not as good as the Feast Buffet at Santa Fe Station."}
{"text":"I love this buffet! Came here for dinner and for breakfast! Dinner was delicious! One of the best things I had was the delicious fried rice. It was so good we came back the next day for breakfast and it was good too. I had different foods and I liked pretty much everything I ate except the cinnamon roll was a little hard. If you're gonna eat there, get a players card first, it's free and you get discounts. There was a waiter named Nenita and she was so nice! Overall a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"I was in between a 3 or 4 stars. But 3 stars is \"a-ok\" while 4 stars is \"yay i'm a fan\" I chose to give it 4 stars because yeah, i would definitely come back here again.  If you join their players card, you get $5 off your buffet price. So I believe it was $18.99 for dinner?? I THINK.  To me, I'm a simple kind of girl when it comes to food. Just give me the basic stuff like pizza, pasta, dumplings, hot soup, salad bar, potatoes, chicken, rice...you know...simple basic everyday food. Don't give me none of that fancy-smancy crab legs, oysters, sushi....basically the seafood crap that AUTOMATICALLY makes the price skyrocket.  With this buffet, it satisfy my needs.  Best part of the buffet is the dessert bar. For such a simple buffet they have a variety of cakes to choose from. They also got a ice cream station with many flavors to chose from. Now, for me, a dessert bar is not considered a GOOD dessert bar if they don't have my MINT N CHIPS OR PISTACHIO gelato and/or ice cream. But thank goodness they have mint n chips!!! =) Yay!!!!! I'm a happy girl. You can turn your ice cream into a milkshake too!!! + on that one.   To break it down:  M Resort \"Studio B Buffet\" : 5 stars TI/Rio's Carnival World Buffet: 4 stars Green Valley Ranch Buffet: 3 stars Aria Buffet: 2 stars ...and thank goodness I didn't have to experience a 1 star buffet in Vegas yet.  You know I've been to Vegas too often when I start to venture off the strip."}
{"text":"Went Sunday evening. This use to be good quality & small but with decent selections.  Now Minimal selections & lower quality food.   Red Rock puts this place to shame for selections! Try going to RedRock & you will see for yourself.   Maybe ok at Green Valley on Friday Seafood night but still, minimal selections?  Salad bar was sad.  Service at pasta station poor. Had to find someone to wait on us. Other than BBQ Ribs, Chinese food was somewhat bland & generic.  No selections to speak of at Mexican or Italian food stations.  Cashier & Waiter service was good."}
{"text":"WARNING!!!!  Disregard the 24 seafood photos posted!   Forget the prior comments regards to Seafood.  Redrock STOPPED their Friday Seafood Buffet!!  Sucks!!"}
{"text":"I have been to good buffets in Las Vegas. The Bacchanal and the Wynn were both first-rate in all respects. After those experiences, Feast Buffet at Texas Station was a let down. There were good stations. The custom tacos and barbecue were both good. The fried fish was dried out and cold. Other items were somewhere in between. Additionally, the dessert options were rather limited, and while the bread pudding and soft serve were good, they couldn't compare to what I have seen elsewhere. If you are going for a decadent buffet experience, don't cut corners. Go for the real deal at one of the proven buffets.  If you just need an inexpensive buffet and you choose your items carefully, however, you can get a good meal from the Texas Station Feast Buffet."}
{"text":"There's a McDonalds across the street.  If you're looking for a bargain, might I suggest you get some fresh air and walk across the street?  This place unfortunately reminds me of the old Terrible's buffet, now Silver Sevens. Coming up the escalator I had flashbacks.  Sadly, I did not go with my gut at the top of the escalator and make a u-turn.  The good news, it's better than Terrible's, even cheaper.  The bad news, read my opening sentence.  Just don't do it.  Even if you go in with low expectations, even if the price beckons to you and you're rationalizing, what do I have to lose?  Salad dressings not labeled, roast beef could not have been more tasteless and unappealing (well, it DID look good under the heat lamp, I dunno what happened between the time the guy cut it, and it got back to my table!), limited selections, food just didn't \"look\" appealing.  Please, show some backbone, put down your player's card, stop thinking of the price, just walk outside and head across the street."}
{"text":"Ita low priced buffet and the line can be long, food is 1/2 decent and can be cold. So if your looking for a GREAT  place this isnt it. On par  that horrible smoke filled casino"}
{"text":"Food was descent. Well worth the $12 Sunday brunch. But Andrea the hostess is 5 stars! She's ungodly"}
{"text":"The rating is for the food and service, not ambiance, at the Texas Station Gambling Hall & Hotel's Feast Buffet. I prefer to give this place three stars (wasn't a hateful experience), but the wife really enjoyed her selections and told me it was worthy of four stars. Of course she wins that battle (I choose my battles wisely)!  Typical buffet fare, nothing real special to me. The pork ribs were tender, falling off the bone easily, and the sauce was above average; but could you bring them out of the back instead of pulling them out of a hot cart right in front of us and literally dumping sauce from a giant bottle all over them?  I am not going to write a long review on this place, because like I noted in the paragraph above - a standard / typical buffet. This place is off the beaten track, if you are one to stay on the Strip or Downtown during your stay in Vegas, and caters primarily to the \"locals\". Having that in mind some of the \"locals\" that frequent the \"local buffets\" are \"interesting\" to say the least... so you may need a strong stomach for that aspect! LMAO. Was kind of sad, but funny at the same time (and somewhat nauseous), to see a 400+ pound woman take five tries to pivot upwards and out of her seat (not because she was stuck in it mind you), while her pathetic husband just watched; or wondering how someone without teeth can consume not-so-tender prime rib.  I won't willingly go out of my way to eat here again, but if in the neighborhood while visiting family and this is where they want to go I won't battle them over it (remember, I choose my battles wisely).  BTW - costs $4 more for dinner if you don't have a player's card."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet I ever went I went there Saturday morning with my family and it was pretty cheap to come in we only waited a few seconds then our table was selected there was a decent amount of food from Sushi all the way to barbecue and delicious desserts one of the best desserts I ever tasted was the gelato with the brownie in the end I love this this is why I give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"Our experience at this buffet's champagne brunch was 5 star!. Mainly due to the exceptional service of Yvette. She is wonderful. The food was pretty great today, also. Asian food tops, Real mashed potatoes, bread pudding, many more really good items. Definitely a 5 star experience today!"}
{"text":"If your looking for great all you can eat crab , come here on Friday $ 21.99! Great food and super crab. On a budget goto crazy buffet on rainbow, not as good selection, but great all you can eat crab too for 12.00"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Employee simply did not care nor understand the meaning of customer service. I downloaded the rewards card on my phone. Stood in line for more than an hour and the cashier told me that I need to get a physical card or pay the$5 difference. That is a significant discount for a party of 8. Stood in line to get the card for 20 mins then to the back of the buffet line."}
{"text":"This is my third time coming here to eat and the first was back in 2009. The food has definitely improved since then and the staff is always very nice when we come here. In my opinion it doesn't have much of a variety of foods than other Feast buffets but for the price it's not that bad. It's closer to where I live and my boyfriend enjoys the meat and pasta station a lot! He says this buffet is his favorite compared to the others. I just wish they had an assortment of gelato or ice cream but self serve isn't bad too I guess. I also really love their chocolate bars filled with walnuts and coconut! I think they serve that at other feast buffets as well."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say about this restaurant is that the staff was nice and the buffet area clean and orderly. Compliments stop there since everything my family and I tried to eat was dry, old, stale, and generally disappointing. I would not eat here again and I would not recommend."}
{"text":"There was a time when I'd proudly bring \"out of towners\", here anytime of the day or night and not fear crappy typical casino buffet. However, that's not the case anymore, this morning being proof positive of that. First, they're \"giving away\" a free buffet at breakfast or lunch to some locals with players cards.  We cruised in for breakfast about 9:30, not too busy and lots of staff on hand.  This food was so bad it exceeded the Fiesta buffet in low quality slop.  If you're going to give locals something to get them in to spend $,  it should be edible.  Scrambled eggs were soupy and by the time I got to them they were gone. I will post a pic I took after pointing out to one of the workers at the buffet that we were all waiting for her to finish her convo with another worker and get some freakin eggs.  There's no protein which isn't pork except teriyaki chicken (I'm dead serious)  so the mountain of bacon which they added to, even after it was toppling over and the grey sausage (browned would be good, right?) are all you get.  I don't eat pork so I was relegated to eating eggs & potatoes.  All forms of potatoes were so greasy it was disgusting and pancakes were burned and akin to a sports discus in texture & hardness. Took a pic of the uncooked corn beef hash which looked like dog food according to another guest who was waiting with me for scrambled eggs!  Where is the management and quality control here?  It was not worth eating for free and that's sad! Omelette's were offered but the other food was so disgusting that the line was 10 people long, I don't know, add another omelette person to the mix from the group which stands around socializing?"}
{"text":"Great gelato and some weird banana ish pund cake with almonds.  I love desserts so this had some good stuff.   They have a stir fry place and it was mayhem.  It took too long and it seemed a new person was working so people literally stood there for 10-15 minutes to get their mongolian stir fry.  The burgers were great!  Baked chicken was good too.  But it's comparable to most other buffets in general."}
{"text":"Very basic buffet with a fairly short wait.  You will find Asian food, including a Mongolian grill, Mexican, Italian, American ( chicken, potatoes, green beans, meats), salads and desserts such as pies, cakes, cookies and ice cream.  Water and beverage glasses were kept full.  Dishes were taken away quickly.  The prices are very reasonable for lunch.  Nothing out of the ordinary and dishes were kept full.  Pleasant staff."}
{"text":"Had the breakfast buffet. All of the food was pretty good, with the exception of the bacon. Overcooked, and so thin you could almost see through it. Eggs Benedict was great! Pretty rare to get perfectly poached eggs at a buffet, but they did them right. We'd go there again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent buffet for a very low price. I want to say it was like less than 11 dollars for dinner. Serious bang for the buck."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star, I would. Hollis your ass. Beyond unprofessional. The cook behind the international station who embarrassed me in front of other customers when I asked him nicely if there was more brisket in the PASSOVER section, thank you for ruining my lunch. I just got there did not even get my drink and asked for my money back.   Steve Katz, I have complained to you numerous times. Deaf ears. I really feel bad for you. I'm sure you try to keep things going, but the place looks run down, the food looks like a old cafeteria food. The people who are behind making the food have a nasty attiude and don't care. Food and beverage obviously doesn't care   Your on the bottom of all stations buffets. Fiesta Henderson is 20 times better than you and they are a basic hotel. Shame....  People wake up... COMPETITION IS FIERCE NOW."}
{"text":"Feast Buffet has decent food at different stations casinos, and this is one of them. The food isn't spectacular, but it's still decent. There are many different cuisines.   My favorite thing to get is a slice of roast beef and some aus jus. There are some desserts available, which didn't really stick out to me but the ice cream was good!"}
{"text":"If you want to remember junior high style cafeteria food then this is the place to be. Cardboard pizza and burgers, taco meat that smells like armpits, and egg rolls filled with rice.... \"eeks methink not\" is right. There is a reason it is 6.99 for lunch, there is so much salt and artery blockers,  that you will need to save money for the hospital visit."}
{"text":"Food was very good until I saw this woman making pizza . Good thing I didn't eat it, she was grabbing wood to put in the oven with her blue gloves on then grabbing a towel wiping down everything then she grabbed the pizza dough and cheese with the same Nasty gloves. I was OMG. No she didn't but yes she even grabbed pepperoni with the same Nasty gloves on. I got up went over to the woman who was the manager on duty and said what she was doing that ,that is so nasty she was embarrassed .  Health dept would be all over that if I call, that pizza maker needs a write up and classes Again nasty cook!!! This is what we eat 3 stars for the other food 0 for that pizza ."}
{"text":"My husband and I were most definately pleasantly suprised! We were so tired and starving and we were staying at arizona charlies so we didn't want to go anywhere far away. We were nervous about eating here and it was Saturday night and no line so we thought for sure we were in for it. The casheir was the nicest lady on the planet and she gave us a big fat discount! The food was amazing, everything was delicious. Nothing was old or cold or weird and the salad bar did not taste like the lettuce came out of a bag. Which makes me super happy! And our server was awsome! Everyone here was friendly and pleasant and for a buffet it was decorated kinda classy! It was so good we went back again tonight! And for the price I think it was one of the best buffets I have eaten at in a very long time.  :)  very pleased."}
{"text":"Food: 4 Service: N/A Ambiance: 3 I always eat breakfast here at least once each trip. Love the bagel bar with lox and white fish and pickled herring. Lots of seniors (like me, but local) seem to meet here for breakfast. I've also enjoyed the omelet bar."}
{"text":"Stay far far away!  For a Station Casino this place was VERY DIRTY, crap all over the floors and dust along wall of our booth.  I can handle a little mess during a busy eating time but not when it is close to 9PM.  Will not be back and I will be writing a letter to someone.  I felt bad, I took an out of town friend there.  The food was below what I expected aswell."}
{"text":"A breath of fresh air from the buffets on the strip. I went for the dinner and breakfast buffet and really enjoyed both. The food was great and the price very reasonable (we got $10 off for signing up for a free player's card). There was a huge variety of food- asian, american, italian, mexican and an amazing salad bar. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because of the long wait and unhelpful service."}
{"text":"The service at this mediocre buffet was sooooo slow.  We were done eating our second helping at the buffet before our drinks arrived.  The staff in general were unfriendly and not very accommodating, save one server.  I would never make the trip out to this buffet since there are so many others in Las Vegas with cheerful helpful staff elsewhere. DON'T BOTHER GOING HERE!"}
{"text":"Feast Buffet is one of the few cheap buffets in Las Vegas that's actually good!   FOOD: The overall quality of the food is decent. You get what you are paying for (regular price $19.99, player's card price $14.99). The buffet covers 9 different cuisines: Sushi and shrimp, American (mashed potatoes, meatloaf, fried chicken, etc.), BBQ, Italian (pizza & pasta), Mexican (tacos), Asian (the basic Chinese dishes, curry, tom yum soup, etc.), Farmer's market (salad bar, soup, and breads), and International (veggie burgers, humus, falafel), and a small dessert section.   It's better than your average Station casino buffet and I do appreciate the variety. For example they offer tom yum soup in additional to the usual egg drop soup, and Indian curry in the Asian section. The only downfall would be the dessert section. Literally there were only 8 different desserts (various cupcakes, carrot cake, cookies, and sponge cakes), 4 sugar-free cakes, ice cream, and a peach cobbler/bread pudding section. I wasn't impressed at all and majority of them were on the dryer side.   OVERALL: When I'm tired of AYCE sushi and KBBQ I would come here to satisfy my AYCE cravings."}
{"text":"Food was excellent prices fair very clean, friendly, welcoming atmosphere prime rib was superb loved the blue cheese wedge salad and clam chowder was delish!!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 11:15 am, and this was our 2nd trip for the lunch buffet. It wasn't as good as the 1st visit two weeks ago.  Every food station we chose from today, the food was cold, even the baked potatoes!  So we will double think another visit, as there are many other buffets to experience."}
{"text":"The employees were very polite. Service was interesting. We had two toddlers and were giving two high chairs both dirty. One high chair was missing a strap so we tried to make it work with the two as it had alert been adjusted. Ended up catching one of my toddlers in the stomach. The pinch left a bruise. Not sure why another server was wearing gloves to take orders and pull plates? We survived :)"}
{"text":"I'm only giving them 3 stars because WILL our waiter was Awesome but the food was horrible. I've been to green valley and red rock and the buffets were amazing I didn't think this would be horrible and it even looks dirty. Will was amazing kept our drinks coming and cleaned our table often he looks like the only happy employee here. Thanks for being a great person"}
{"text":"Food is garbage.  Dried out Mexican food is crap.  \"Sushi\" rice is horrible.  Salads come in bags.  Not so fresh.  Only thing descent is the carving stations and deserts.  Those that rate this among the best buffets in Vegas must also think McD's is the best hamburger.  The management obviously doesn't eat here or things would change.  Save your money."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time and I would say over all I was pleased. The line moved a little slow, and I didn't understand having to pay full price for children. The food was pretty good, nice selection and variety. We had the players card so we did receive the discount . I would go again though."}
{"text":"Lord almighty, don't do this to your stomach.   We were out and about and thought we'd give this buffet a try. Oh, how I wish we hadn't! The $4.99 advertised meal is actually $17.99 but you get $9 off when you have a players card - so we had to go and find someone to help us get a players card, which took about  20 minutes. We then got into a line to pay for our meal, and then got into another line to be seated. We were inside the casino a full hour before we could actually get to a table.   We did a thorough walkthrough of the buffet before selecting anything to put on our plates. It was horrifying. There was food from a plethora of regions - and all of it looked like it would piss off our digestive system - even the nacho bar. We selected a few small items and attempted to eat. We were repulsed. It was cold, and flavorless. The ribs were all fat. Things that should have been crunchy were mushy and things that should have been soft were hard.   We gave the dessert bar a try - and the collection of items we chose tasted like lard sprinkled with sugar.   With the plate still in front of him, my husband looked at me and said, \"Wanna get out of here and pick up some Taco Bell?\"  When Taco Bell sounds more appetizing than a $17.99 buffet, you've got a problem.   Gross."}
{"text":"So much choices for the price! You can find everything from breakfast food to BBQ, pasta burgers  salads, sweets etc... Make sure you sign up for the casino rewards program so you get a good deal on the price! Also you get free OJ or soda of your choice. Servers are attentive too."}
{"text":"Not the best top notch buffet, but it will do for the money. I always like to eat on a budget. Food was pretty good. If your looking to eat a fancy casino buffet, this isn't the place. If your looking to just eat a fast good meal; than I recommend this place. Nice price and pretty good food for the money."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the Feast Buffet at the Red Rock Casino.  I generally avoid eating at the buffets of Vegas, as there's so many other great food choices.    The only two buffets I would ever recommend are The Buffet at the Wynn Resort and Casino (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ ) and the Feast at the Red Rock Casino!   It's at least THREE stars but here's why it gets 5...  + 1/2 STAR for the great seafood section (although I'm not an eater of seafood, the selections looked great and fresh!) + 1/2 STAR for the selection and quality of Asian foods +1 STAR for the Gelato Bar  Excellent choice, you won't be disappointed at the Feast !!!"}
{"text":"I've gone here twice for breakfast in the past two weeks, with the price being the main reason why.  It's normally $7.99, or $6.99 if you have a player's card, but they've been sending me coupons for $5.99 breakfast.  That's a sick deal!  I've been showing up at around 10:45am and have had no problem getting in before 11am to get the breakfast price.  They have a made-to-order omelette station where I saw people ordering eggs over easy and other non-omelette foods as well.  The food's really good, and at 11am they bring out the lunch foods, including some sushi rolls.  I've been there for dinner before, and serve nigiri as well.  Dinner seems overpriced to me ($18.99 or $16.99 with the card), but breakfast and lunch are way worth it."}
{"text":"Good for the price but dont expect spectacular. The egg line was way to long, so never got freshed cooked eggs....thats okay though,  i was distracted by the cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"A few out-of-town friends were staying at GVR so I joined them for breakfast. $6.99 for an all-you-can-eat does sound like a great deal, perhaps even evoking nostalgia of the good ol' days of Vegas (inflation-adjusted, at least).  Here's the problem: Most of the food tastes like it came from the frozen section of the grocery store and was zapped in a microwave. Dry, lacking flavor, and totally uninspired. I guess you get what you pay for.  To boot, the seating process stunk. Half the dining area was empty but there were still huge lines. Also, the seater would pull 2 parties at a time from the general line but then only 1 from each of the hotel guest/Platinum and President/Chairman lines, so those lines were actually far slower. I'm certainly not one for elitism, but if they're going to do it this way, they might as well just have a single line for everybody.  At least when we got seated, the waitress was pretty good about keeping our drinks topped up. For what it is, I think this buffet deserves around a 1.5, so I'm going to round up my review to 2 just because of her.  I remember several years ago when the food here was actually good. They charged more, but at least the food was far better. Frankly, even if I were staying at GVR or lived in the area, I'd rather drive to the Strip and pay $10+ more for a real breakfast buffet that deserves my time."}
{"text":"Hate that there is no ZERO rating on yelp.   We came here on a Saturday for brunch at 10 am with my husband, mom and dad.  Got up and left after 20 minutes of being at the table, after the manager basically berated us and left us completely humiliated making false accusations.  We felt discriminated against.  We will no longer be coming to redrock casino.  We have been coming here for years,  bringing friends to eat out,  gamble,  we watch movies at the theatre.  This has. Even our local hangout spot and due to this horrific experience at the FEAST BUFFET of all places.  We will NVER set foot at redrock casino ever again.  I asked for a contact number to speak to someone about our experience and I was given just a general email to contact some customer service.   UNBELIEVABLE!  Can't even write a review on the food,  we only got halfway thru our plates before we got up to leave.  Oh and brunch for all 4 cost us close to $90.00.  None of us drink so we didn't even touch the champagne."}
{"text":"Just about everything they serve is greasy. They have a lot of the same selections prepared differenty. How many different versions of the potato do I want to dine on in one meal? I get it... they are affordable and can be mass produced into... more side dishes. The chef who was so kind to make my omelet was incredibly grumpy and possibly mad that I asked for real eggs. Bacon is never crispy ... soggy and greasy. Yuck! Station Casino Buffets are only good when they open a brand new location. After 6 months they start going down hill. At least this one is not as smoky inside like Palace, Texas and Santa Fe."}
{"text":"My family and I frequent the buffet every few weeks just because it's nearby. Although we always use player points to pay for the meals, it does seem fairly inexpensive for an average meal. Don't expect anything fancy or unusual...it's pretty standard Asian, Italian, Mexican, and a carving station. The dessert selection is okay however the quality is lacking-they present much nicer than they taste! It's never too crowded which is nice but your best bet is breakfast in lieu of lunch or dinner. They do have a cook to order omelette bar that is pretty good."}
{"text":"it was cheap for cardholders only $10 but not recommend for regular price is sub par at best and the best part of the whole buffet was the desert bar"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the more underrated buffets in Vegas. There probably aren't as many choices here as some of the buffets on the strip, but the food was seriously pretty good.   The only downsides were the commonalities of buffets. Things like... my perogies (polish dumplings) getting stuck to one another since they're next to each other on the plate. But... they have perogies!   Actually the best thing I had was the stuffed salmon. Fairly fresh and not overcooked! Everything else was generally pretty good. At least 3/4 of it, if served as an individual dish at a restaurant, I would've given 4 stars. Especially for the price!  As everyone says, sign up for the boarding pass before-hand! You get a lower rate for the meal, and if you activate your card by playing one of their free games (1st time only). You get something between $1-10 on your card that you can immediately spend on your buffet.   That takes a few more dollars off your discounted price! Not a bad deal for vegas! :)"}
{"text":"It's cheap $7.99 for lunch and the food is what you would expect for the price. It's ok for a quick bite and it kept me from over indulging since nothing was really worth going back for seconds."}
{"text":"If you like your roast beef GREEN...run don't walk to the Buffet at Palace Station!  See my delicious picture.  I know this company has had it's financial problems in the past but I don't see how serving green meat is going to help attract and retain business."}
{"text":"What a great buffet.  Fast friendly service. Good food, everyone here is definatly a pro in the buffet business from the cashiers to the line cooks to the waitresses and the servers.  This place is well run and has the staff a pleasure to have served me.  This is what i expect out of all these buffets.  I glad i stop in.  Thank you all at the Feast Buffet."}
{"text":"Came here to avoid traffic before heading back to Cali. My cousin suggested it because with a players card dinner is only $15. One card is good for 4 people. It was worth $15 for sure! It reminded me of a fancier Hometown Buffet. The food wasn't gourmet like buffets in Vegas, but it was fancier than other \"normal\" buffets with normal buffet food. They had prime rib station which is always a plus. They also had a taco making station. Also, you could make your own pasta. The salad was delish too. My sweet tooth was satisfied because they had a little dessert buffet. We were there at closing so most of the good dessert was gone, but they still had some of their good bread pudding and of course ice cream! I got vanilla and ordered a root beer and made a root beer float. =D This ended the night for me. I was stuffed! Definitely got my $15 worth! Would consider coming here again if I needed to kill time before heading home."}
{"text":"The food is alright (not a lot of options), the service is better. Its an easy option to feed us both with whatever we want when we cant agree. The dessert all tastes the same though."}
{"text":"I took my son there tonight and I would have to say the food is great!  Not all buffets are good, but this one had a great selection and the food was always fresh"}
{"text":"Food was buffet food but fresh fried eggs and omelets  SALAD BAR was the best and O did i mention $7 bucks a person !!!!"}
{"text":"We met friends here for dinner tonight and had a great meal.  On my first pass, I got some stir fried bok choy, a selection of grilled, cold vegetables, blackened catfish, and a piece of garlic-parmesan bread.  All were quite good!  Fore the second pass, I had Mongolian grilled assorted seafood with snow peas, garlic, chili paste, fresh chopped garlic, mushrooms, and baby corn.  I got it done with the garlic, chili sauce and it was excellent with a good amount of spiciness.  It could have had a bit more zing!  Dessert was a strawberry milkshake and a piece of chocolate cake.  I really like this buffet as a change.  They have dishes here that aren't served at Red Rock, so it's a treat to make the trek to Henderson now and then to eat here.  Besides, our friends had coupons for four free buffets, so the price was excellent!"}
{"text":"Sunday morning breakfast with Maggie was awesome! We attempted to go to Baby stacks but it was a 45 minute wait so we went to the Feast and it was a feast. My girl isn't a big buffet person but she had to admit the buffet was awesome.   If you have a players card the prices can't be beat and the food is awesome! I have to say that aside from the great food the decor is extremely nice."}
{"text":"We met friends here for a quieter buffet than the lines one can experience at Red Rock.  There was no line and we were seated promptly.  Some of the food items are the same as the Feast at Red Rock but there is a difference in some of the offerings.  I especially like some of the pork dishes that were different from most buffets.  Dessert selection was a little on the anemic side but what I had was OK.  Service was good.  Our iced teas were refilled promptly, used plates generally were cleared quickly, and our ocffee was promptly brought."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a lot of times because it's almost in my back yard.  Visiting twice in the last week reminded me that it was time for a review.  Thursday evening, we met friends for the dinner buffet.  The prime rib was outstanding - red, the way I love it.  They were also grilling slices for people who want their meat dead.  The shrimp were good, but I did skip having any sushi.  Instead, I loaded up on some kimchee and then on to the gelato area for my dessert fix.  Today, we went for breakfast.  It's always a nice way to start the day.  A bit of chopped chicken liver, some smoked salmon, and a small sampling of oatmeal with raisins, brown sugar, and cinnamon.    I'll be back often.  I like the food and the ambiance.  My only complaint is, \"Where the hell are the spoons?\"  You'd think they'd at least have spoons automatically in the morning table settings when so many people are having coffee.  This is not just a Red Rock gripe, either.  I see this more often around town.  Why?"}
{"text":"I am giving five stars for what I ate. I had turkey, creamed spinach (THE best), mashed potatoes and gravy, corn, black-eyed peas, cranberry sauce, AND ROASTED GARLIC (WHO else does this???); all of this was great, and I had two helpings of pretty much the same things. I also had greens that I did not like. I did not have any salad bar; I do not care for pickled beets. I tried spaghetti with the Bolognese sauce; it was good, but I didn't want to fill up on pasta! The desserts were pretty much like most buffets, mediocre; I tried the apple pie with frozen yoghurt (I cannot figure out why these places cannot get pie crust right; it is NOT that difficult), coconut cream pie (this was good; I did not eat the crust), and bread pudding with warm vanilla sauce. The staff was wonderful and competent, although I do not usually rate staff. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I tried this place out a couple of months ago with my boyfriend and a good friend. We got here on a Sunday night..pretty late..probably around 9pm or so. There were still a good amount of people here even though it was a Sunday night.  Let me start off with a huge minus...there weren't any sushi!!! I mean..how can they call their restaurant FEAST AROUND THE WORLD, and have no sushi??? I found that pretty odd, because even the lil cheap buffets you see everywhere have sushi!   Anyways, they had a lot of the traditional American foods such as mac and cheese, fried chicken, pizza, many different pasta dishes, they had prime rib, and then they had the mexican station where you can create your own tacos/nachos. They also had an Asian section with the typical fried rice/chow mein. They had your other typical Asian dishes such as orange chicken, wontons, hot and sour sweet, etc.   One thing I liked about this restaurant though is..they had the FRESHESTcrab legs ever!! I mean..and they had three different styles! They had the Asian style..which was cooked with ginger and green onions..very tasty. My only complaint would be that it was not temperatute hot enough. They also had the chilled crab legs that you could dip in butter. And then they had a section where you pick as many crab legs as you want, and then you put all these ingredients such as garlic, peppers, soy sauce, onions, etc into a bowl and they stir fry it in front of you! It comes out piping hot, and basically comes out to your liking, because you're giving the cook what you want him to cook your crabs with.   Their dessert selection was also plentiful. They had a bakery like display, and you just picked what you wanted. They also had a smoothie bar! I have never seen that at any buffet!   At the end of the day, I wouldn't mind coming back here agian just the for the crab legs. I still can't believe they didn't have sushi!"}
{"text":"For anyone trying to compare this buffet to one that is double or triple the price, don't. Just get out your fat wallet and move over the strip. For others of us who want decent value with good, everyday food, this is the place. I'm not overly picky and I like non complicated food that I can identify with, I guess you'd call it comfort food. I've been to all those expensive buffets and I still say for the value Palace Station wins."}
{"text":"Came for steak night on Saturday. It's only 15.99 with players card and the selection is amazing.   Steaks available are NY strip, bacon wrapped filet, prime rib, rib eye, and carne asada. There are several sushi choices as well. The tamales are good and there are a ton of sides and veggies to choose from. Glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday Brunch at Feast Buffet located at the Sunset Station in Henderson Nevada. Very reasonable price with unlimited Mimosa. Food was excellent. Lots of choices. I had the Menudo soup which is great. And the roasted garlic was to die for. Onolicious. If you want to get away from all the hustle and bustle from Las Vegas Strip, Henderson may just be the place. A miniature Las Vegas without the hassle and \"big dollars\". Reasonable priced hotels as well as various shows and eateries. Will consider staying out here next visit... jafaga808"}
{"text":"Review of weekend buffet , food is fine,  typical las vegas Faire not to crowded.    That should have been a hint.  We waited like 10 for our drinks, just coffee and juice , enough  time to do the buffet line and still no drinks.  When we asked for the drinks little high school looking  server gives us the whatever and grumpy off.  We ask for new server and move on.  The old server then shows up at table doing the bad movie thug shoulder  shrug and yelling at table you got a problem.  Wow suddenly  a Las Vegas resort is Walmart.   Wow very professional. .   To top it off later manager comes over , was it to apologize  for the H.S. drama?   No it was to threaten us with security because the server ( hmm a relation?)  Said he felt threatened. By our party of 2 new mothers a 4 and 6 year old and the aunts and uncle's )     good god avoid this ghetto trash buffet"}
{"text":"Excellent quality and value. Lots of 2:1 specials for locals. Peeled and deveined shrimp. Friday seafood buffet has great crab legs. Also very good for breakfast and lunch. Same wait in line as any quality buffet. Go early or late and it's about 15 minutes except on holidays."}
{"text":"I LOVE buffets, and this one is no exception.. i live near Red Rock Casino and the food is always good and service is always on point. Which, for me, is no easy feat, because they have the best unsweetened iced tea ever, and in one meal i can have upwards of 5 or 6 of them. Never have to wait for refills.. very good selection (even for vegetarians), and  probably my favorite \"affordable\" buffet. My favorite of all time is Bacchanal at Caesar's, however Feast buffet is a fraction of the price, comparatively. Never have left less than euphoric and ridiculously full!! Recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"How do you make rice stale??? The gumbo looks like vomit, and everything is cold or look pureed. The stuffing looked like paste... Need I go on? 0 stars for this gross place."}
{"text":"I haven't been to the Red Rock's Feast buffet in years. Today  we were in the area, hungry and couldn't decide where to eat so we decided to stop here. No line at 10:50am...score!   After being seated I went around and the big hunk of ham caught my attention. I just had to have a slice of that yumminess. So I stood and waited for the two ladies who were busy taking out the breakfast items and putting their display in front of me. No one bothers looking at me. So I patiently wait still. Then, there were 2 of us , before long there were 8 people lining up for the million dollar ham. It's like waiting for Mariah Carey and Celine Dion to finally acknowledge our presence. Ridiculous! So I say, Excuse me miss, I just need a small slice of of ham pls. NADA...crickets. They keep unloading and talking in Spanish. How rude! By that time I didn't really want the ham anymore, but I had to have it in principle. Finally a young guy with a chef's hat comes over and smiles at me. He looked new and asks one of the witches what he should do, I tell him I want some ham, they show him how to cut the freaking ham THE WRONG WAY and the guy had to figure it out on his own. So I get my ham and vowed NEVER to return.   In fairness, all the people we came in contact with except for the two Divas  were very nice and friendly especially our server Tes.  Food wise, the shrimp ceviche, the pork curry, the pork bao and the coconut cream pie were pretty good. Skip the tomato bisque, it's grainy."}
{"text":"8 years in Las Vegas and this is my first visit to Texas Station and its Feast Buffet. Came here with the fam today to try their Sunday Brunch with bottomless mimosas and it is surprisingly good. It is smaller than most buffets but everything I tried was pretty good except for the dessert items I tried.   The pork roast deserves a special mention. It was juicy with a nice crust, very flavorful. The made to order al pastor tacos were good. The menudo was pretty good, so was the jambalaya. Didn't get to try the Asian and barbecue sections. The salads didn't look too appetizing. The dessert section had the usual offering. Tried the pecan pie but it was too jello-like, not very appetizing. They had 3 soft ice cream flavors and 2 sorbets. Service was 5*. Everyone was nice and corteous. Our server, Princess was on top of everything even though she was very busy.  This place gets very busy during the weekend. By the time we left around 1:30pm, the line was pretty long already. Price is $9.99 for brunch with boarding pass. They also have the buy 1 get 1 promotion right now(with coupon)."}
{"text":"Would say more 3.5 but I round up because the service was nice, price was very low budget for the food quality (not the best but not the worst) . Satisfied with money spent, you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Buffet located in the Red Rock Casino, one of the more popular places for Las Vegas residents to hang out. In addition to this buffet, they have a bowling alley, movie theater, etc. For dinner or Sunday brunch (with the player's card), it's a low $13.99. Came here with a buddy. Both of us were hungry. Both left satisfied.  Setting: Located within a casino. As such, there are a lot of smokers. As a result, it smells like smoke. I only mention this because a lot of my friends will purposely avoid areas that SIGNIFICANTLY increase your risk of lung (and esophageal, stomach, bladder, renal, etc.) cancer. That aside, you walk to the entrance where, at the time, only one cashier was working. It took about 25 minutes before we ended up reaching the front of the line. One of the major drawbacks to this dining experience was that there were two people working the cash register but only one appeared to be working. There were plenty of open tables so I can't really see how they'd justify not putting both to work. Oh well. The tables are widely spaced. Regardless, it's pretty loud in the dining area. Every table has great access to the food. Individual grade: 3  Waitress: The waitress who sat us down seemed like she hates her job. She responded appropriately with \"You're welcome\" but never once smiled or made eye contact. Just going through the motions. In stark contrast was the waitress that actually waited our table. She was warm, friendly, and always smiling. Plates were cleared quickly and cups were refilled when they dropped down to about 25% full. Individual grade: 3.5 stars (dropped because of the first apathetic employee)  Food: THERE WAS SO MUCH FOOD! International (Mexican), Asian (Chinese), sushi, BBQ, farmer's market (fruit, cheese, salads, bagels, and breads), and dessert. The sushi was not fresh, nor were they generous with the fish. That could be countered by just taking more pieces. The chinese food was unoriginal (orange chicken, chow mein, egg-drop soup, etc.). Surprisingly, the orange chicken was the best dish. Not too much of the bread coating coupled with moist chicken...Mmmmmm. BBQ had some great roast beef. Medium rare with horseradish!!! The most impressive station had to be the dessert. They had approximately two dozen pies and an assortment of cookies, cakes, and ice cream. HUGE SELECTION! Individual grade: 3.5 stars  Drinks: Champagne served with Sunday brunch. Mimosas were tasty with a minimal amount of pulp. Individual grade: 4 stars.  Recommendation: Definitely try it. Affordable with a large amount of food and great variety."}
{"text":"I was visiting my sister in Vegas, so we all went here on Saturday. The price was really cheap (casino food), so that was nice. The selection was pretty wide, but the service just seemed lackadaisical. The waitress took FOREVER to take our drink order. I had finished two plates of food by the time she asked what I wanted. It wasn't until my third plate that I finally got my beverage. Maybe to solve the problem they should just do self serve drinks? Idk... It seems weird that you can get your own food, but for whatever reason, they have to bring my drinks?  The food was actually pretty good... I was impressed. I just had a really hard time getting over the drink thing.  All in all, however, if I was in Vegas again, I'd probably give this place another shot. If I had a different server, I think my experience would have been 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"It's crazy here, the cashiers and waitresses here don't know what the manner is. Shout at customers and making face to each other bcz customer don't have small cash. Incredibly rude. The worst restaurant in palace station. Be aware"}
{"text":"$13.99 pp with Players card for a Sunday night buffet?  Not bad.  This buffet is located inside the Red Rock Casino Resort which is a really nice hotel/casino in a suburb called Summerlin.  This Buffet offers a little bit of everything which why it's a perfect place to bring a crowd where everyone can't decide what to eat. You'll find Asian, Italian, Homestyle, Southern, and Mexican kitchens serving up various entrees.  For dessert your kids will love the assortment of pies, cookies, ice-cream and cupcakes.  For those watching your waistline a huge salad bar with fruits, cheeses and salads and soups allows you to maintain your figure in the land of FOOD.  I had the roast beef and mashed potatoes and broccolini which sadly fell short on tasting like any kind of broccoli I've ever had-yucky.  My child had some fish, macaroni and cheese, Cesar salad, ribs, roast beef, shrimp, dumplings, steamed broccoli, egg roll and fried shrimp...he came with an appetite.    Meanwhile my picky eater had a slice of pepperoni pizza, a breadstick and a scoop of chocolate ice-cream for dessert, so I didn't exactly get my money's worth on him!  Overall the food was tasty, service was friendly and the buffet has lots to choose from.    My only complaint is at the dessert kitchen. They only had one server who seemed SO BOTHERED to serve anyone a piece of pie or a scoop of ice-cream. She didn't say one word to us or any other customer, no smile, nothing!  She made us feel like we were bothering her and begging for pie! Unacceptable! Please send Ms. Grouchy to the back to get her meds and keep her away from customers!  Her poor attitude didn't keep us from getting dessert-but it didn't offer quite the happy ending we would have liked.  Overall, not a bad place to bring your out-of-town guests who are dying for a \"local\" buffet experience."}
{"text":"For one of Station Casino's better high-end resorts, this Feast Buffet only gets an average score from me.  The food was highly so-so.  I think since I frequent a bunch of the Station Casino buffets in different locations (hello, Platinum Station card holder!) I could possibly be burnt out by their similar offerings in each of them.  Although I will say Green Valley's Feast does have some uniqueness to it with some different dishes.  The line for this place is usually long, especially on a weekend.  It used to be super-duper long when the BOGO coupons came out a few summers back and there was AYCE crab legs offered.  I think this is when this Feast hit it's peak.  What happened to the seafood extravaganza, Station Casinos?  Bring that shiz back!  Feed us hungry piggies!  Now it's just bordering on the mediocre and meh and blah for me.  It's just doesn't have the appeal that it used to.  We used to drive from the NW part of Las Vegas to go to this buffet.  Now, I'm almost afraid to say I can go to the Santa Fe Station or Texas Station and have a similar experience.  Almost...thankfully.  Green Valley's Feast has just about all the same dishes as any of your typical Station Casino buffets here: American, Chinese, Italian, and Mexican are all represented.  You got your salad bar and your dessert bar...yeah, all practically cloned.  I will give Green Valley's Feast a bit of a leg up here though.  They do have a few things to offer that other Feasts don't.  For one, at dinner they usually cater to the Hawaii resident crowd, serving up some 'almost' authentic Hawaiian food.  They had katsu when I went last time (though a bit dry), and a little whole kalua pig (apple in mouth included) as well.  I say kalua, but I highly doubt this little guy was roasted in ti leaves with Hawaiian salt in an underground imu (aye, oven for you non-Hawaiians).  I've seen a kalua pig before but I stood there people watching anyway because the looks on many a caucasian's face was, well...PRICELESS.  I mean, it was just funny watching their faces of 'OOH' and 'AAH' and 'EEK' from many a passerby.  Hilarious!  Yes, I counted each of the folks I observed staring at this whole roasted pig.  Any yes, majority of them were of the caucasion descent.  But at least the pig went somewhat happy because of the grin of it's little face.  I salute you, oh tiny piggy, as I graciously take from your bountiful belly area.  YUM.  Green Valley's Feast will also let you get a sandwich done on their griddle/stir fry area.  I had a decent Philly Steak and a Reuben on my visit.  Sure beats a burger for a change every once in a while.  The only other thing at this Feast that was a hit for my family was the shake and malt section.  I love me a good malt!  I mean, these weren't high quality, high butterfat malts but at least it was a nice change from all the other gelato stations you see now at all the other Feast buffets.  Myself and my kids enjoyed a shake and a malt each to wash down our dinner.  Plus I might have had a malt to go.  Service is the usual at the Feast, fast but friendly.  I'm glad our server took the time to keep our glasses full even though her section was obviously full that night.  Price is on par with all the other Station Casino Feast buffets.  Visit here if you live on the Henderson side of town otherwise I think you might be ok with going to the one nearest you!  But do go here for the little piggy show!"}
{"text":"Really...I only came to this buffet because:  1) It's close to my work 2) I had a comp for a free buffet that was due to expire by the weekend  I'm really not too picky about buffets in general because:  1) I'm a cheap eater...lots makes me happy 2) I eat at Chinese buffets!  An iron stomach comes in handy  But the Feast Buffet in Palace Station?  Meh.  MEH!  I really have had better.  The only saving grace for this place is the near extreme cheap prices for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  If you go for dinner it's less than $9 before tax!  If your budget is in a recession and you want choices (or you're a UNLV undergrad on a date and want to impress with quantity) than come visit here.  If you're looking for quality...ah, you might want to saunter somewhere else.  I had eaten at the Feast Buffet several years back and I just don't remember it.  It wasn't good, but I don't remember it being bad.  It's just very lackluster.  I'm sure when O.J. Simpson stayed here pre-arrest he probably ate here.  If I came that day, I probably would have given this place another star.  Yeah, some food, and possibly a signed football from one of the greats?  Sure.  Of course this all depends if I had a football on me that day.  This Feast Buffet is typical as those of all the other Station Casinos in town, with one major caveat - SIZE.  Yes, unfortunately in this case size does matter.  This buffet is like only 1/3 the size of the rest of them!  I've seen more choices (and fresher choices) at the local Golden Corral!  It's just sad.  So sad.  It's like Palace Station is the bastard child of Station Casinos.  Nothing about this place screams gourmet.  No sushi (even faux sushi), no real Asian section either.  Pot stickers (badly cooked ones), and fried egg rolls DO NOT make up an Asian section.  The Feast Buffet at Palace Station is heavy on American and Mexican fare.    Though to their credit they do include an Italian build-your-own pasta section, where the cook will make you any basic pasta dish you like with you choice of veggies, meats, and sauces (LOL...red, or white..seriously).  That is not bad as long as the chef cooks your pasta right.  Luckily my Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp was hard to mess up.  Only complaint was that the sauce was too heavy with not enough cheese.  The rest of this buffet was really kinda just under average.  The carving section with meats was OK, the only standout to me was the carnitas which were tender.  You can also have a cheeseburger done on the grill, just demand that you get a fresh patty thrown on and not one that sits on the side in a container of grease.  Yuck.   The salad bar was way under par, not only was it messy at the time, but a lot of the veggies didn't look freshly prepared.  Lots of canned stuff.  Color me not impressed.  Don't even get me started on the dessert section.  What a shame!  It's like a tiny island in the middle of nowhere.  And the desserts STINK.  Basic cakes and pies, that really don't look all that appetizing.  What...no gelato?  Only soft serve available and it was no bueno.    The Feast Buffet here (as well as possibly the majority of Palace Station) needs some serious renovating.  I would gladly pay a dollar more for the buffet if it was vastly improved.  It needs some serious help.  Until then I probably won't be back.  Unless I get another comp that needs to be used on a Monday - Thursday."}
{"text":"Wanna ring in 2015 right for cheap eats?  Do yourself a favor if you already haven't - go to Red Rock Station Hotel & Casino, head over to the rewards center and sign up for a FREE Station Casinos player's card, then mosey on over to the Feast Buffet.  BAM!  World of cheap (but mostly tasty) eats!  I've always heralded the Red Rock as having probably the best food out of all of the Feast Buffets Station Casinos has in Las Vegas.  Eats are plentiful, setting is modernly pretty, and the prices are more than reasonable.  I mean, if the line is long, you really can't be wrong!  I think I'm up to like 13 Yelp check ins here now, how the HELL am I not the Duke of this joint?  I cannot stress enough, this Feast Buffet is no Michelin star, celebrity chef-ridden restaurant.  You won't find your fancy tomahawk ribeye steak here (lookin' at you Bacchanal), or all-you-can-drink beer & wine included (hello Studio B).  But are those fancy buffets only $16.99 for Prime Rib dinner on the weekend?  Don't think so!  Last time I wanted to eat at Caesar's buffet, I think the price went up to my first born, and the rights to a Lakers first-round draft pick.  Absurd!  What kind of silly buffet has a 'Fast Pass' line for an extra $20?  Upon which you still have to wait 2 hours to be seated?  Oi.  And a coupon for a buy one get one free buffet?!  Ha Ha!  Unless you's a balla like Jay-Z and his wifey Beyoncé-Z, fat chance.  That's not to say the food at Feast Buffet is total crap.  On many nights...OXTAIL!  Yep, Asian section.  Still one of my favorites.  Also, sushi.  Yep, not the greatest, but at least it's offered.  Pasta?  Get a plate fresh made to your liking!  BBQ Chicken pizza?  Yep, this Feast Buffet has got it.  Cauliflower au gratin?  Check.  Prime Rib on the rare?  Check.  Wedge salad with blue cheese?  Check.  Kim chee?  Check.  Pineapple Fried Rice?  Check.  Kim Chee Pineapple Fried Rice?  Check!  Actually I make that last one by mixing kim chee with the pineapple fried rice.   Tips from my last review of Feast Buffet still remain.  It reigns true here - breakfast at the Feast Buffet here is still the LONGEST line.  You know why?  Bargain, that's why!  Get in before 10:45 AM from M-Sat, pay the breakfast price...but stay for lunch as well!  Two meals in ONE!  Yes, this tip is for you out-of-work, college-broke folks that need some food in your belly.  By using this tip you save $2 off the bat!  But don't forget that Station Casino player's card because on average just showing the card to the cashier will save you $2-$3 a person, $5 for dinner and Sunday brunch.  Use that savings for some slots!  Or some beer!  Locals in the know KNOW that the Feast Buffet in Red Rock (though there are valid arguments for Green Valley Ranch) is the place to take your extended family for a low-fuss, high-quality meal.  Look, the economy today just sucks.  Got relatives coming to town?  They want a Las Vegas buffet?  Got champagne tastes on a beer budget?  And you're expected to foot the bill?  Oh yeah, Feast Buffet here is your best bet!  Take you and your spouse and both get Station Casino player cards.  Use them a few times each over the month.  Next month?  BAM!  Coupon in the mail for each of you, buy one buffet get one FREE.  FREE = GOOD.  Just took care of four people at the buffet for the price of two.  BAM BAM!  Play enough slots and poker to use your points for a free buffet or two?  BAM BAM BAM!  PAY.  SAVE.  EAT.  LOOK LIKE HIGH ROLLER STUD.  You can thank me later."}
{"text":"OK, as a Station Casino club member (it's FREE), I'll readily admit we get at least two buy one, get one free buffet coupons just about every month (for very little slot play time I might add).  So to save some duckets, the fam & I will often choose a Station Casino property to have a value breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  A penny saved, folks!  That being said, we often choose to use our coupons at Station Casino properties like the Red Rock or if we're feeling adventurous Green Valley Ranch (yes, driving to Henderson is an adventure for us fuddy-duddys).  However, since we live close to Santa Fe Station we often end up going here for a quick meal.  I've been coming here for years now and for some reason have no clue why I don't have a review for their Feast Buffet.  Plus, I could've swore I had pics here from our most recent dining experience there but I can't find them AT ALL on my phone.  So much apologies for no pics!  You Yelpers will just have to use something rarely seen, YOUR IMAGINATION (no need for Temptations flashbacks, y'all)!  The Feast Buffet at Santa Fe Station is like every other Feast Buffet at every other Station Casino property - BUSY.  Go on a weekend?  Busy.  Go on a specialty weekend dinner?  Busy.  Go on a holiday specialty weekend dinner like Thanksgiving or Christmas?  Busy!  It's busy for the sheer quantity of food a Feast Buffet can put out, and man do they know how to feed the masses!  Not only that, but price-wise...it's Hella cheap!  I mean, only in Vegas right??  Where else you gonna go for an all-you-can-eat breakfast for around $8 a person, $7 if you got your Station Casino club card?  Plus a bonus coupon for a free buffet?  Plus FREE entry for any kid under 2 years old?  Nowhere!  You think you can pull this off at your local IHOP or Denny's?  Hell to the NO!  For families with kids or for families that make a limited amount of income, a cheap buffet is a value treat that will keep a belly full & a crying kid quiet.  Think about it, feed your kid a 'value' meal from Mickey D's...or let them run the gamut at the Feast Buffet for the same price?  Yep, the true value is clear.  But, that doesn't mean Feast Buffet here puts out the quality of food you really want.  That's not to say that they put out low-quality food either...it just means it's all...inconsistent.  Some days the salad will be good & fresh, other days it will be a tad wilted.  The mac & cheese will be delicious some days and on others it will be watery.  One day the roast beef will be done just right at a medium, the next it will be cooked to a near crisp.  The fried shrimp was tasty the one time, but the next it was damn near a rubber ball.  You get my drift here.  A lot of the food is cooked in-house, and with the right care from the chef (yes, some of them are really chefs) it tastes pretty darn good.  But there are some of the line cooks (yes, I consider the unloving one cooks) who just don't give a $hi+ and put out food just to get people out of the damn feed line.  And yes, some of the food does come out of plastic bags!  You think someone cracked all those eggs individually to make the scrambled eggs on the buffet line?  Nope!  It comes from a huge bag of pasteurized egg mix, which is then poured into a pan then cooked like scrambled eggs.  The shu mai or steamed buns you see in the Asian section?  They come from a frozen tray!  Yep it's all true, I've seen them do it with my own eyes.    Although it goes without saying, you come to a Feast Buffet to mainly fill your gullet & not worry about farm-to-table cooking.  This is the blessing of a Feast Buffet, to try and give you a better option over a fast-food meal.  It may not be the healthiest way to go, but for the median cost it sure is a viable choice.  It's not the best stuff I've ever eaten, but I am grateful for places like this in Las Vegas.  For us middle-class cheap folks, it's a Godsend!  Like manna from Heaven!  I mean seriously, eating at the Feast Buffet for breakfast or lunch is actually cheaper than a full entrée at your local chain restaurant!  Chef will make you a cooked-to-order omelet for breakfast, or custom pasta dish for lunch?  How you gonna beat that value?       I got one more way for you cheapies out there to save even MORE money at a Feast Buffet.  See how breakfast ends at 11 AM and lunch starts at 11 AM?  Go for a late breakfast at 10 AM, by the time you are seated you get the last run at breakfast...then your go sign at lunch when 11 AM hits!  Saved you $2 right there!  Pay the breakfast price, stay for the lunch rush!  More bling in your pocket!  I just wish the food was cooked with a bit more care on some of the stations.  Overall, I cannot complain about this Feast Buffet.  It has served my family well for some time now, and has helped us maintain some sanity in those lean times when we were down on income.    Improve the quality of the food offerings and you might just get your extra star back!  #cheapbuffet"}
{"text":"Look, I love me the cheap eats!  So yes I am a fan of buffets!    I don't live on the Hender-tucky side of town so rarely do we ever go to the Green Valley Ranch for a visit.  But with getting that Station Casinos coupon buy one buffet get one FREE just about every month (a wonder what $20 a month gambling with their members card can do) we finally gave in and took the trek down there.  I know, I know the coupon is good for the Red Rock Casino too but with over 25 check ins there (yep and I'm still only 5th place for a regular) I thought it was time to change it up a bit.  Glad we took the journey!  We went on the most expensive nights, Saturday for dinner.  Since it includes prime rib & shrimp for the buffet on this night the price goes up to $17 a person + tax & tip.  But with our BOGO coupon 1 is FREE!  Oh yeah!  That is a deal to me!  Don't care if people say buffets are 'whack' or 'the stuff no one wants to eat'.  Save it all for me then!  Eating on a budget is hard enough as it is, but doing it with a buffet?  Yeah, sign me up.  Let's see...$10 each after coupon for all I can eat of just about anything, or $10 each trying to pick out food to cook from my local supermarket?  I like to cook but nope, that BOGO coupon is tough to beat.  Plus, no clean up!  For us, the Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch didn't disappoint.  Yes, there are lines, yes, there are crowds for high ticket items (like prime rib), and yes, some of the food is downright mediocre.  But tell me where you gonna get as much meat as your fatty mcfatfat self wants, when you want it?  Don't get me wrong, quality is just as important as quantity...but that's why you only eat the things at a buffet that entices you!  Don't be wasting your calories on those rolls of bread!  Skip the cottage cheese please!    And believe me, we ate like kings!  Prime rib, which was actually pretty good by the way!  Rare!  With au jus!  And a side of roasted mushrooms!  Pad Thai that was actually edible!  Orange Chicken that whaddaya know?  Tasted like there was real orange in there!  Roasted Brussel Sprouts!  Sauteed Broccoli Rabe!  Carne Asada Tacos!  Hell I could have got Mongolian BBQ made for myself too!  The list goes on & on.  Had a rarity in the buffet, made to order Gyros!  They honestly weren't that great (or that pretty) but it was offered!  Choices!  I like me some choices when it comes to food because half the time I don't know what I want to eat.  Buffets fill that perfect medium.  This Feast Buffet even offers shakes & malts!  Really!  Not a bad way to end the evening after your feast.    Overall the food was more than decent, some really good stuff in there.  Why go to a buffet expecting Michelin star food?  This my friends is not the place.  Go here to enjoy the food, enjoy your company!  Do what they want you to do.....FEAST!  Then go home & take a nap."}
{"text":"Brutal.  This Feast Buffet is just not tops with me in regards to any of Station Casinos buffet mania.  This along with the Feast Buffet at the Palace Station are towards the bottom for me.  Sometimes you really do get what you paid for.  The Feast Buffet at Texas Station has just about most of the same food stations as other Station Casino properties.  You have your American section, Chinese section, Italian section, and Mexican section.  There is a nominal salad bar, as well as a basic dessert section.  This one is just sad because they don't even serve gelato!  Only soft serve, which didn't look too appetizing on the bland dessert section.  I ate here only because yep...it was cheap.  With your Station Casino card you can have lunch for about $7.99 per person.  A buffet, sure, but don't get your hopes up.  Most of the food in the sections are just plain BLAH.  The turkey was dry.  The fried chicken was over fried.  The mashed potatoes were pretty bad.  How do you mess that up?  The Italian section was average, but pasta was overcooked, and the meat sauce was just OK.  The pizza station wasn't my favorite, the crust was too doughy from being a tad undercooked.  You can get a burger or a hot dog, but make sure you request one that is fresh grilled in front of you otherwise you'll get one that has been sitting in a container of water/grease that sits in the corner of the grill.  Bleech.  Just don't do it.  The Chinese section?  Oh man.  Crap-tastic.  Crap-tastic!  Some of the worse Asian food at a buffet I've ever had.  The stir fry was overcooked and loaded with baby corn.  Where's the beef?  The sweet and sour chicken was hard from sitting too long, and the egg rolls were overdone.  Sad.  Even the white rice was too hard from being under the heat too long.  OK, so you figure at Texas Station the draw would be the BBQ section?  Wrong.  It was pretty plain as well.  BBQ chicken was dry, slathered sloppily with sauce.  The brisket was overcooked, ending up stringy with no moisture.  The sauce was standard that probably came from a bottle.  Too fake-sweet with no oomph.  Not world class at all.  The only saving grace of this Feast Buffet and the reason I gave it an extra star is because of the Mexican section.  They tout on their billboard that you can have all-you-can-eat tacos al pastor.  Luckily, luckily, they are of good caliber.  They are damn delicious!  And those guys know how to make it correct.  A couple of fresh tortillas on the grill, a scoop of al pastor, topped with some cilantro, raw onion, red or green salsa?  Muchos gracias!  This was pretty much all I ate while here at the buffet.  I must have had like 9 or 10 of them for lunch.  They were good!  The tortillas were fresh, the al pastor was made well with some heat and some sweet, cool from the salsa, some texture from the cilantro and onions, and acid from a squeeze of lime.  Best bite I had during my time here!  Will be back as long as they keep the quality of the tacos al pastor up.  It is worth it for the buffet price alone.  You figure almost $2 a taco on the street?  Makes it worth it to hit up the Feast Buffet at the Texas Station for just shy of $8.  Ole!"}
{"text":"Yep, being here in Las Vegas so long I'm sure I've tried every single one of the Station Casinos Feast Buffets by now.  Oh man, I'm so sad.  Or, or maybe I am a connoisseur of middle-class dining?  Hmmm...  The Feast Buffet at Sunset Station is actually pretty spacious, with the nice wood décor and the very tall ceilings it makes the place look gigantic.  At least coming here you won't think you're going TOO cheap on your buffet experience.  This Feast Buffet is open just about all day Monday - Sunday for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Be a glutton just about any time of the week!  Pricing for just about any Feast Buffet is very reasonable too, I mean with their FREE players card, you can eat at any Station Casino buffet for $7 at breakfast, 8$ at lunch, and $10 at dinner!  Value whores unite!  I am...one of said whores.  Here's where you food snobs draw the line in the sand.  I already know this is not the epitome of fine dining, or fusion cuisine, or whatever the next food trend coming our way is (fancy food trucks).  But the Feast Buffet provides food for families in spades.  Bottom line!  I only say this because there are really sooooo many kids here in our town that go hungry.  My kid knows a kid at her school that loves (really loves) coming to school because it's the only time of the day she gets to eat!  Can you imagine?  Yes, many of us are foodie lovers, overeaters, and critical taste-budians.  But man, do any of you like going hungry?  Not fun.  We'll leave it at that.    Foodwise?  Yessir, Feast Buffet here is fairly run-of-the-mill average eats.  Nothing fancy mind you, but lots of stuff that are tasty nuggets if you look hard enough.  Prime rib on a Friday or Saturday night?  Rare?  Hell yes!  A bowl of piping hot posole topped with sour cream & guac?  Sure!  Create your own stir fry?  Ah, why not!  Overly sweet, not really authentic gelato?  A scoop in cookies & cream for me please!  Honestly, by this point for me the food at all Feast Buffets taste basically the same.  But, with that comes familiarity.  With it comes some sort of weird comfort.  Get what I mean?? It's like a peanut butter & jelly sandwich on Wonder bread with a glass of cold milk.  Nothing fancy, nothing mind-blowing...but oddly comforting.  That's what a Feast Buffet is for me.  I've rated the Feast Buffet at Red Rock & Green Valley Ranch in the past at closer to a 4 star, and that's mainly because the food quality is actually better there for a lot of the dishes.  But I'm pretty consistent with keeping the other Feast Buffets at a 3 star.  Call it biased, but it's probably because I have a long history with these places stemming back to my UNLV days.  LOL, having enough leftover change back then for a Feast Buffet after a long week of working 2 jobs and endless studying was pure joy!  Kept me fed when those days of too much Top Ramen made me fed up.  So will the Feast Buffet ever live up to the hype of a Bacchanal or a Wynn?  Probably not.  But will the Feast Buffet not care what we Yelpers think and keep doing what they're doing?  Probably so."}
{"text":"First, if you can't enjoy the scenery at Red Rock Resort you might just need to rethink what are your Vegas priorities! The buffet, along with the resort, are just gorgeous with yet a homey feel to it! I recently went back for the breakfast buffet and once again I left very satisfied! You get tired of buffets in Vegas for sure, but if you space them out and stay away from the monster ones on the strip you can appreciate one like Red Rock! The seating is such large comfortable cushion chairs that it beckons you to eat more! The usual breakfast items are there, along with some additions like potato pancakes! The pastries are freshly made and just a delectable array of fresh made donuts! Grab you a free Stations Players Card and enjoy this for just $8! The casino itself lends you to walking around and enjoying the view of a well thought out and gorgeous resort! This southern gentleman always looks forward to his visits to Red Rock!"}
{"text":"Once this was a favorite of mine, inside Sunset Station which is a favorite of mine, but now this buffet is fading fast!   My recent visit was disappointing due to warm food that should've been hot.  The exact same selections that have been there repeatedly for the last ten years, and basically not creativity from the staff.  You wonder why you need to salt things to add some flavor, and why a lot of the items are dry on the bar at 6pm? Sad I am, as I've known this buffet for 10+ years, and with a extremely comfortable dining room I always felt a sense of comfort!  The dining room staff are as friendly as ever, the seating just as comfy, but the food sadly is ten years ago!"}
{"text":"Haven't née neaten here yet.  Service is horrible.  Manager unreasonable.  Waiting with my group where they triaged us by the buffet.  If you have a group larger than 4, avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"The Buffet King says....  This is one of my trust worthy lunch spots off the strip when I'm hungry for a buffet but not wanting to pay the high prices of the strip buffets...  BTW.. Not all station feast buffets are created equal..... trust me....  Why do I like this place?  Let me tell you...  1)  Awesome Asian cuisine selection...   Love their Eggplants, Mabo Tofu, and most of all, Chinese BBQ pork!  (Be sure to get those ones that has a little bit of fat on it!)  So good!!!   2)  Pretty tasty Italian section... meatball were my favorites and the Alfredo sauce was pretty creamy too!  3)  Pretty good selections from Mexican, American, and pizzas!  But I never get to try those because I'm so addicted to the eggplants and the BBQ pork....  4)  Nice salad bar!  Caesar salad here is soooo much better than souplantation's  5)  Nice Dessert Section with various pies and cookies..  (And NSA choices as well)  Cold goodies are gelatos in 6-7 flavors....  Weekday lunch is only $9.99.. the most expensive meal is the Friday night Seafood running at $27.99 (but as expected because it's seafood)  All other times are less than $15 bucks easy even dinner.....  Here is a great tip for you all!  Before leaving...  Be sure to stop by the gelato, ask for your favorite flavor shake!  YES!! Pick your favorite gelato and the nice staff will make you a delicious ice cream shake in no time!  We love our espresso and Pistachio flavor shakes!  This is a hidden secret of sorts... but don't say I never share any goodies with you all!"}
{"text":"decent food, but good price. if you're not willing to spend some big bucks at vegas, then this buffet is a-okay!  i actually enjoyed the philley rolls in the sushi section lol. the desserts were not that good, but everything else was pretty good!"}
{"text":"Having been to the same buffet in Vegas over and over again, I decided to take a local's advice to eat some place new.  The Feast Around The World Buffet is located inside the Green Valley Ranch Casino, just a short drive from the strip.  For the 21 and over kids, before going to the buffet make sure you stop by the rewards club and sign yourself up for their players' club card.  Present your new rewards card at the buffet and save each person $2.00.  Plus they will give you $3.00 free to gamble.  (Right after we ate I won 50 dollars off the $3.00 the casino gave us!)  Being away from the strip I wouldn't expect the casino and the buffet to be filled with bustling Vegas junkies like myself.  And I was right.  The locals were out this Friday evening and the buffet was only at half capacity.  The buffet isn't all that big and doesn't offer as big of a variety as some of you might be used to, especially for Vegas' standards.  However, I thought what they lacked in variety they made up in quality.  I thought the food was well prepared and a buffet with all you can eat snow crab is always a plus!  (They have both hot and cold crab legs!)  I can't think of a buffet that has snow crabs for less than 17 dollars a person."}
{"text":"You know the saying, \"You get what you paid for\"? Well, that's just it. Not the best quality. Their meats were dry, vegetables and other platters were over cooked and some looked like they were sitting out for a while."}
{"text":"This is probably not going to sound to good because I didn't find much to favorably write about, so I'll to be as direct as I can with minimal words.   It was \"Fish Friday\" today but apparently only a few chefs were aware of it. This could explain the limited number of fish items or just perhaps they interpreted the word fish in the singular   The price jumps over $3 from the normal price but since I was using my points I'd thought I'd have some salmon, tilapia, or even some catfish. NOPE. But they did have swai (??) some cod (deep fried unidentifiable but the label said cod) and shrimp (hey it's not seafood night...) other then that the selection for fish night was very poor, terrible in fact. Clam chowder?? Maybe they meant clam FLAVORED chowder because it was seriously lacking clams. Chili??? Very salty!! Plenty of beef and the normal stuff that they served on a Wednesday but charge $3 less.  I literally struggled to find something to eat during this visit. I did have a salad  but not a garden salad because they had no cucumbers, zucchini, cherry tomatoes (they did have canned diced tomatoes) ugh.... disappointing.  Desserts? I'm not sure because I didn't try them because I just wanted to leave...  Told you at the beginning my review wouldn't be a positive one. But I'll update it one day........ One. Day."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing the food I've placed on my plate. It's brunch so don't be freaked out what you read here.  Egg Benedict was very salty and the sauce was not made with real butter either. Tator tots were fine as were the biscuits and gravy. The potstickers I had were also pretty salty, they were tasty but the salt content in my eggs Benedict and potstickers was overwhelming, actually I think salty we be my adjective describing most of my food today. The steamed veggies were pretty good though. I did order a custom made omelet and that was very good. The waffles and blintzes were tasty as well.   I had a bite of almost everything but I was surprised by the overall saltiness in the food today. It's not always this way but today was abnormal I hope.  Summing  it all up, during brunch I recommend the custom omelet, blintzes with strawberries, a few strips of bacon, steamed veggies, and fruit. If you eat anything else may I suggest drinking plenty of water to flush the sodium from your body.  Peace"}
{"text":"We have eaten at both the breakfast and dinner buffets at Red Rock. Some of the food is terrific: duck dish and the oxtail dish in the Asian section when they have it, the toffee cake dessert, the chocolate chip waffles. The service is very good. We wish they would bring back the smoked salmon and the cold whitefish to the salad station."}
{"text":"I just want to start this off by saying I am in no way a Buffet Guru.  One day I hope to be able to gain such a prestigious title, but until then I am a buffet enthusiast at best.  My fiance has lived in Vegas his entire life and this buffet is by far his favorite buffet in life. Period. End of discussion. I think its more of a nostalgic thing then anything, he came here a lot as a kid and it brings back great memories and I'm all for that!  But for me, This buffet is Okay at best. I mean the food is hit and miss for me. There are some things I really do like and somethings I will never put in my mouth again. For the price it is definitely a decent meal.  Cons:  The line is always wrapped halfway around the casino to get in... Like seriously? Calm down this inst Disneyland.  The service is very sub-par. Sometimes we go through an entire meal without ever getting a refill or seeing our server again. This is a biggie for me because I can go from 0-Grouch real quick if I'm thirsty.   Overall I'm satisfied with this place but I can honestly say if my fiance didn't like this place so much I wouldn't go."}
{"text":"good and affordable..     Cashiers were very friendly and helpful.    The coupons they mail help so much too."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast only. Make sure to get the players card to get the $6.99 breakfast deal (weekdays). There was a little free bonus game to play right after receiving the card and all the points you get can be used for the buffet. We ended up only paying $16 for 3 people.  The breakfast is solid. Well, let me take that back. I guess the only food worth eating is the omelette. Made right before your eyes to your liking. The cook can also make eggs and melt cheese over them: delicious!   Aside from the omelette, they serve donuts and the usual: eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, ham. They also serve tacos, menudo, fresh fruit. Desserts and other pastries are definitely not good here.   Will I go out of my way to come back? Maybe not. But maybe for a quick meal when I'm staying off the strip, I'll swing back around."}
{"text":"Watch out for the bait and switch.  This place was rated a top ten Buffett due to their surf and turf which was crab legs at one point. They have since discontinued that and while the prime rib is decent they are definitely not worth the cab ride from the strip. We brought up with management and their response was that this is not what their website advertises while they still tout the top ten status."}
{"text":"Great place great food I go here every once in a while with my fam always something good for everyone BBQ is proboably the best part with a movie and some gambling for a day its an great place to spend the week day or even a weekend."}
{"text":"The place is pretty good and the only buffet in the neighborhood.  You can do much better on the strip, but it's a long drive.  This place has inconsistent food quality.  When things are slow they shut down large sections and you have little food to select from.   Some of the dishes are fresh and others are old.  They seem to be understaffed and slow to replace the missing items.    Be sure to use a players card to save $1 - unless than changed recently."}
{"text":"Aliante Station & Casino is the closest casino to my house. Hubby and I eat here occasionally. Prices are good. Place is clean. Staff is friendly. They have a good salad bar and otherwise a good selection of foods. I always get a big plate of salad and something else I find appetizing."}
{"text":"It a fine and dine. Don't always have the best variety but its good enough for the affordable price."}
{"text":"Feast Buffet (Santa Fe Station Casino)  This review is for their breakfast buffet, not the dinner.  Bottom line, the Feast Buffet at Santa Fe Station Casino is dirt cheap.  The breakfast buffet cost me only $6.99 and I had a $6 credit voucher.  Do the math. I paid almost nothing for breakfast.  The scrambled eggs are extremely watery, the bacon is way too greasy, the pancakes rubbery, and everything else lacked flavor.  One thing that is good is the made-to-order omelets and the glass of water.  The service is excellent since I served myself.  Other than that, there's not much else to say.  It's a very inexpensive breakfast buffet and you get what you pay for.  3-Stars!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had  breakfast here just this morning (07/21). We have eaten from this buffet several times but today was a total disappointment. Almost everything I put on my plate turned out to be horrible.   The fruit was still fresh and cold and the iced tea was great but the hot food items were terrible. The omelets were dry on the outside with mush on the inside, the french toast was crumbly (I think the bread was really old), the Eggs Benedict was........well I'm not even sure I can call it Eggs Benedict. The eggs were completely cooked through....not poached as they should have been, the muffins were hard, and the Hollandaise sauce was barely noticeable. The sausage links were rubbery. The yogurt was the surprising disappointment-full of sugar and inedible. My husband complained that the coffee tasted burnt (or old). The biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon saved this meal for me.  The service we received was OK. We were seated quickly and our server was attentive.   This place was much better before the change in ownership."}
{"text":"I admit it, I'm a Yelper and I watch what I eat. And on my most recent visit, I watched myself eat 10 scrambled eggs, 11 slices of bacon, 2 sausages, and about a cup of cheese. I'm not a huge fan of liquid scrambled eggs and wanted the real stuff. So I had the cook at the omelet station scramble 10 eggs for me. The people behind me gave me a hard time and directed me to get the fake stuff. For a second, I felt bad for holding up the omelet station line. But only for a second. I want my eggs!!   I've been here a few times over the last 30 days only because I know that I can get a huge volume of food for a very small price tag. I'm not typically a buffet type of guy. However, a buffet has its place when I'm behind on calories. Overall, Sunset's Feast Buffet for breakfast is pretty good."}
{"text":"Met for an early lunch here. The service was great and they were able to seat our large group fairly quickly. The price is right on point, very affordable for a family. The food is so-so, pretty typical for a casino buffet. The salad bar and hand scooped ice cream are nice features."}
{"text":"So My Boyfriend and I tried this out this weekend, I must say it was quite good... Its a really big buffet, but not a good variety I would say, or a least not the best variety! The food tht was there was absolutely delicious though, we went for Prime Rib and Shrimp night... tht was the special and you could get as much as you would like and that goes for whatever the special is for tht day or night. I would still definitely go back it was really good Prime Rib, and you can get it cooked to the temp. of your liking. All the other food was super fresh, taste just right didnt need any extra seasoning, warm, kept it coming out... it was definitely a good try. Their dessert section is crazy amazing, there are so many fresh dessert like constantly put out! OMG they had tttthhhheeeeeeeee BEST BREAD PUDDING i eat bread pudding anywhere I cant get a good one and I had to go back for 2nd's on this one! This was overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend it or take friends and family here!"}
{"text":"The buffet here is really good. They have a really great variety of foods and desserts. The staff is always friendly and very attentive. My favorite is Sunday Brunch. And it's a good price as long as you have a boarding pass."}
{"text":"Weekend brunch was great; service was very very good and buffet options were varied and very good quality. Line to get it was quite long though; about 45 mins - worth going at off hours."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet in Las Vegas in terms of quality, variety and value. I eat here at least once a week. You can go all the time and never have the same meal twice. This buffet is a bargain at dinner time. For around $14 you can eat all you want and it includes a soda, coffee, tea, etc.   This buffet isn't the fanciest in town but it excels at serving good quality, crowd pleasing dishes. There's a great salad bar that features several pre-made salads (think Asian salad, coleslaw, spinach and blue cheese salad, chicken salad, marinated artichoke hearts) and a fix-it-yourself traditional salad bar. Cocktail shrimp are also in this section as well as fruit and cottage cheese.  The Asian station is top notch with a variety of veggie, beef and fish dishes and good soups / rice / stir fry. The Mongolian grill is my favorite feature of this buffet! You load up your bowl with fresh vegetables (they have a great selection that includes spinach, mushrooms, onions, noodles, peppers, zucchini and lots more) then tell the chef the type of meat you want (chicken, shrimp, pork beef, Korean ribs) and choose from a list of sauces and they cook it up for you. It's always good and always fresh. They will also cook up a cheesesteak for you here too if you ask, or if you just want a plate of Korean ribs they'll oblige.  Next comes the Mexican station with MADE TO ORDER FAJITAS, several good Mexican dishes and a taco bar. The American station is fine with carved roast beef (usually prepared very well done), salmon at dinner and delicious roasted turkey. You'll usually find fried shrimp, fried chicken, baked fish and more. They have a good selection of vegetables here too, including green beans, broccoli, mashed potatoes, corn, cabbage, collard greens and other favorites like macaroni and cheese.  The Italian station is good too with sausage and peppers, a variety of pasta bakes, spaghetti, garlic veggies, and antipasti platter and YUMMY fresh-baked pizzas. I love the pizza here, it's so good but it's also popular so you may have to stand around and the pizza oven and wait for a fresh pie to come out on the line. You'd better move fast because the pizza disappears as fast as it's served.  The absolute highlight of this buffet is their dessert section. They have an INSANE selection of sugar free desserts. I am in dessert heaven at this place. Choose from sugar free brownies, cream pies, apple pie, cherry pie, chocolate fudge cake, lemon cake carrot cake, cheesecake....and this is just the sugar free section! They also have NO SUGAR ADDED frozen yogurt in their soft serve machine, another feature I go bonkers for! There's a scoopable ice cream case as well where you can get hand-spun milkshakes (sorry, no sugar free options in that case). I never eat the full sugar desserts but there are plenty of cookies, pastries and other goodies.  The lines here can get out of control so be prepared to wait. If you go at less popular times, you can usually get seated in less than 10 minutes. Go during peak hours and you'll be waiting anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. The only other negative comment I have about this buffet is the service. Sometimes it can be horrible, other times it's good. Try not to sit too far in the back, that's where you usually get stuck in the bad waiter zone."}
{"text":"I ate here out of desperation and I wasn't expecting much but I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. This is not a bad buffet despite appearances. Now, it's not as \"fancy\" as Red Rock or Green Valley Ranch, but it's cheap and a remarkably good value. I'm also happy to report that my purchase of this buffet did not come with a free ride on the diarrhea express (I'm looking at you, Sunset Station).   The food is simple and not fussy. The buffet is tiny but there's a good salad bar, pizza, Chinese food that's comparable to Panda Express, some okay Mexican options (but really tasty chicken fajitas -- go figure), and the usual suspects like mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, fried shrimp and a made-to-order pasta station. There aren't a lot of green vegetables on offer here so veggie lovers like me will want to load up on salad. I was shocked at the quality and variety of meats at their carving station. During our visit they had really good roast beef, turkey, ham and fresh salmon! I know they switch up the selections but I felt like I hit the buffet jackpot. The desserts are good too, and there are several sugar free options.   If you have a Stations Casinos dining coupon / offer, this is a great place to spend it. You get the most bang for your buck here since the buffet is so inexpensive. The two of us had a $30 free comp and we got two dinner buffets and a bottle of wine and still had comp money left over. Now calm down, their wine selections are about what you'd expect. We slummed it with a bottle of Beringer white zinfandel and it brought back nostalgic memories of my college days. Even if you don't plan to gamble one penny in the casino, sign up for the free Stations players card and they'll knock a couple of bucks off the price of your buffet if you show it when you pay.   This is not the best buffet in town, not by a long shot, but the food is tasty, cheap and you can feed your entire family a much heartier meal for just a few bucks more than at In-N-Out burger across the street."}
{"text":"Wow, the Red Rock buffet has improved a lot recently! I don't know if there's a new food and beverage person in charge, but what a difference! I've eaten at this location many times over the years and the quality had declined over the last year but now all of a sudden, it's back on top. This is one of the better Station Casinos buffets. I usually dine here for dinner so that will be the focus of my review.  The salad bar is extensive and is the best feature of this buffet. There are quality toppings to make your own creation (from crumbled real blue cheese to grilled fresh asparagus) and there are also some really fancy pre-made salads (the roasted vegetable with farro is my favorite). If you dine here and only eat salad, you'll be pleased and will still get your money's worth!  The reason this buffet is tops with me is the abundance of vegetables. Most buffets \"cheap out\" by filling most of their trays with simple carbs like potatoes, fries, rice and the like. Not here. On my most recent visit, I ate curried cauliflower, steamed broccoli, sauteed green beans, Southern collard greens, garlic brussels sprouts, zucchini, roasted peppers, grilled asparagus and more. It is a veggie lover's dream! Vegetarians should find plenty to enjoy here. Meat eaters, you aren't left out either! There are always several carved meats, tacos, pizza, shrimp cocktail, sushi and more.   I'm also a huge fan of their desserts. They have the standard soft serve ice cream machine but there's also a hand-dipped ice cream counter and an extensive sugar free section with delicious sugar free pies (coconut cream, chocolate, cherry, pumpkin, marbled cheesecake and more). Ask at the dessert counter for a fresh slice right out of the case.   The lines here can get outrageous any time of the day, so be prepared to wait. Even the VIP players card and hotel guest lines are long. The staff work as quickly as possible to seat everyone but even with a large dining space, they seem overwhelmed. Prices are reasonable (sign up for a free players card to get a discount) and include non-alcoholic beverages and all food on the buffet (bring cash because the price does not include gratuity)."}
{"text":"As far as vegas buffets go, this place is pretty decent. decent quality and selection.  There is much better(strip/the M) but there is also much much worse. 3 stars"}
{"text":"I've made the cardinal mistake of coming here on Father's Day. Yes yes, lack of insight. I've paid dearly for it.  I checked the prices a few days before. No mention of Father's Day or Holiday pricing. Sunday brunch is costly enough. Father's Day brunch cost $25 (w/o players card). The line was crazy long and I didn't know about this steep price until I had to pay. Would have been good to have some time to get a player's card.  But this is father's day! Bring out those father's day special buffet options!  ...  I would say it was exactly the same as the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station (where it's close to $10 most days), but Sunset Station was better. First, it looked like the dining room was tinier than Sunset Station. This with the combination of being a busy buffet day could explain the wait. The options were the same Feast options you always see.  I had some of the Chinese options, which were not good. Broccoli and beef was just slimy goop. Orange chicken was dry. Tried some American breakfast. The bacon is the kind of Oscar Meyer microwaveable bacon you see discounted at the 99 cent store.   I just settled on Prime Rib. That's the go to food for me at a buffet. One lunatic wanted their prime rib well done. The prime rib I got was a medium rare slice of goodness. Was it worth the 45 minutes in line and $25 a person (and I paid for five people)? Nope.   There's no shortage of buffets in Las Vegas. This one would be an adequate buffet on a Wednesday morning, but avoid this buffet at prime times."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Sunset Hotel due to a training seminar held there. I had an hour for lunch and decided to try this buffet. OMG, This is the worst buffet I've ever ate at in my entire life! Awful! I want to vomit just thinking about it. I sampled quite a few items because I just knew it couldn't be this bad. Wrong! Save your 12 bucks for McDonalds! Seriously!"}
{"text":"I have been here before (when they first opened and a few times after). Came back here for my dad's birthday (haven't been here in awhile) and wow, amazingly disgusting and disappointing. This place use to be good from what I remembered. Walking back and forth and the food was just horrible. Old, dried and not fresh. The carving station was all overcooked so it was hard and chewy. There wasn't much protein to select. Mac and cheese was very powdery (if that's a word). The best thing to eat was their pizza, garlic bread. and mint chocolate chip ice cream. The salad station was lacking as they never did refill what was gone. All in all, it was a waste of gas (since I do not live close to it) and a waste of money. Will never come back here again!"}
{"text":"Of all the feasts I've been to, this one is dead last on service and selection. It is also the smallest buffet I've ever been to in Las Vegas. They have a place in the middle where you can order either a fresh from the grill burger or made-to-order pasta. It seems like it would be a good idea, however the set up lacks a place to actually put in an order, being that there is glass up and all around. If you are of average height you either have to bend down or tip toe over the glass to be heard. Even then the cooks let me stand over there for a good portion of time before they would even acknowledge I was waiting to place an order. One even caught my eye and flat out ignored me. The buffet is small, poorly stocked and a flat out waste of time and money. Just go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here after a recommendation from a friend. It's Labor Day weekend, so they were having a Special BBQ dinner, with raised prices because of it. Nothing compared to the prices you would pay on The Strip, so I can't complain. The food choices were great, everyone at our table was happy with their dinners. Desserts were definitely horrible though, everything was stale and flavorless. So as long as you don't want good desserts, this great is a great option to save money on a good dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been here dozens of times, mostly for breakfast or brunch.   Not a bad price to let the hogs loose at the trough! Plenty of dishes to choose from, a decent salad bar and really delicious desserts.  Between my wife and I, we have probably received a few dozen free buffet coupons, so we have seen it through the years and the food has been pretty consistent.   This is where you can feel like a winner after you get beat up on the gaming tables. If you are local, usually RR sends out 2-4-1 buffet coupons if you have signed up to their Boarding Pass."}
{"text":"This buffet was a $20,000,000 error!  In the past this had always been a favorite place -- especially to take visiting friends and family, however, this evening I was very disappointed. Here's my story:  Arrived at 4:16pm and was surprised that there were zero others in line. This should have been a red flag, as the Feast Buffet was always packed. I was informed by the cashier that they were serving dinner at $9.99 per person. I paid for two and we were seated.  My primary complaints are as follows:  1) Food quality is MUCH lower than on previous visits. It is obvious that most of the food is frozen-TV-dinner-entrees. 2) Food not served at the proper temperature. Many items were luke-warm, including: green beans, mixed vegetables, meatballs, egg rolls, spare ribs roasted potatoes and sweet & sour chicken. Actually, just about everything I tried was not hot enough. Sliced roast beef was so tough it could not be chewed. 3) Cost cutting measures that destroy the dining experience. A great example is in the Asian food area, where they offer only one entree (sweet & sour chicken) but there are 5 different starches. White rice, brown rice, fried rice and two types of noodles) 4) This should have been #1... All of the food was old, stale and left over from lunch. 5) The desert bar was a wreck! Ice cream was melted to slush and the cookies were as hard as rocks! There were some one-inch squares of cake that were stale and flavorless.  As a manager, I feel this buffet is a total failure. The original idea of a buffet was to over feed people so they play blackjack and slot machines until they are able to walk again. In my case most of the food was inedible. I must also question the savings when so much food is thrown away because it could not be eaten.  Advise to managers: Hot food hot; cold food cold! As for the $20 million error... It will take that much -- or more -- in advertising before I even consider returning to any Station Casino property.  UPDATE: In addition to this review, I had posted a comment on their Facebook page. That comment was given the standard copy-paste reply to contact someone else, and I did -- however, the gave me the wrong email address. Posted another comment about not getting a reply and was given the super-secret-correct email address. A week ago I resent that email, and have yet to hear from them. With that said I will downgrade to a single star based on the fact that corporate customer service is every bit as good (read: \"horrible\") as the buffet."}
{"text":"I was reminded last night of why I'd only been to this buffet once before. Twice is likely enough too.  This buffet is the Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch, and it's similar to the Feast Buffet locations at other Station Casinos. It's also significantly more expensive at $14.99 for dinner w/ Boarding Pass (the players' card, which is free to sign up for) compared to $10.99 at Sunset Station (which is actually much closer to where I live), and with little more to show for it than perhaps some more cooked-to-order options and desserts. It's probably a premium because GVR is branded as a bit of a resort destination compared to the standard Station locations.  Fortunately, my friend treated me with a soon-to-expire free buffet pass. We even bypassed the wait by using the line for President level Boarding Pass cardholders. Perks of having lost a bunch of money via gambling, I suppose.  The food is fairly basic fare, with proteins as fancy as some sort of roast beef, shrimp, and fried fish. I found it odd that they didn't have any sort of baked or more \"healthily\" prepared fish filets, which I see all the time at my preferred Feast Buffet. They do have various made-to-order cooking areas, and I skipped all of them (even the unique Cold Stone-esque ice cream) after recalling how tough the meat was in my bowl ordered at the Mongolian line. Plus, you're expected to tip on all of those.  The best part about a buffet is being able to try a lot of different food, so I took full advantage.  Food that was relatively good: sweet and sour (battered/fried) fish from the Asian area, fried sea bass (somewhat near the meat carving stations), fajitas (if you make sure to use the tortilla to mitigate the saltiness), fried chicken (Asian area), pumpkin ravioli (seasonal Italian selection), \"chef's special\" breaded and fried shrimp (really tiny but good), bread pudding w/ vanilla sauce, apple cobbler (hooray, hot desserts), ice cream.  Food that was just OK: Chinese BBQ pork ribs, Swedish meatball (tasted like Italian meatball but with gravy), shredded lamb (Mexican food station), stuffed pasta shells  Food that was less tolerable: breaded/fried butterfly shrimp (I must've gotten the old batch that had been sitting at the bottom, but that's still not cool), orange chicken (rubbery, yet not crispy), pork tamale (too little meat), menudo (decent tripe but underseasoned soup, couldn't detect any spices/herbs other than chile pepper), chocolate pudding in a cup (trying to aspire to the chocolate mousse at more upscale buffets).  Honorable mention (in mediocrity) for the beef at the carving station for looking so unpalatably gray that I skipped it, for how they ran out of some desserts toward the end of the evening (but still before closing time at 9pm), and for how all of their larger plates are hot (I changed my mind on getting cheesecake for dessert, but my frozen yogurt ended up melting).  I haven't been to this Feast Buffet on one of the special seafood nights (with crab legs reportedly offered), but I still see no reason to try them again when I can find similar if not better offerings at a much cheaper price at my neighborhood Feast Buffet. Well, unless it's my friend treating me for free."}
{"text":"I normally don't eat the feast at Sunset Station because I had it a few years back and the food was gross. Well 3 years later and there still is no change about that. The only reason it even gets 2 stars is the fact that on Sunday's they have a good brunch menu. That doesn't excuse the main issue, dinner. Fist I had a salad from the salad bar, hardly any lettuce in the bowl and the lettuce that was there was brown and wilted. I asked the employee if he could get fresh lettuce and he just looked at me then completely ignore me and my request.  Ok fine lost my business in that department.  Next was the carving station, food was ok but the roast beef was nothing but fat, not hardly any actual meat. The chicken was good but hardly any flavor due to the lack of seasoning. I didn't try the sausage because I'm not a fan, but my husband said nothing great about it.  I tried the oriental station and it was less than mediocre. Food was only warm and not hot, very close to the food danger zone which is not good. The dessert area was good but messy. I did try the carrot cake and it was the highlight of my food night. It was very moist and oh so good. My son made a root beer float and he loved it. The service aspect of it was good. The guy was on top of refills and clearing the table. Off all the buffets I have tried this one offers less choices than the others."}
{"text":"Back to five stars.  They currently have this excellent frittata in the International section. I could probably eat it all day on its own. They also have some pretty good BBQ pork eggs benedict and, surprisingly some pretty nice pizza. It was crunchy, it was fairly thin on the crust, and it had gooey cheese and some nice ham and mushrooms. I also finally tried the grapefruit juice, and I'll definitely be ordering that from now on. It tastes a lot less artificial/strange than the orange juice and is far less overpowering than the cranberry juice.  The chicken fried steak almost seemed more like school cafeteria type chicken nuggets. I would avoid it. The bacon is on the salty side, so be aware of that when you're balancing your meal. I continued to avoid the frozen yogurt machine, having instead pancakes and waffles for dessert.  I feel like this is always going to be a great buffet because it's always busy, so they keep bringing out fresh food (in addition to the made-to-order omelet stations at breakfast and fresh Asian station at lunch/dinner), and it's a really great value at 4.99 for breakfast (and 7.99 for lunch, 9.99 for dinner). As long as you stick to smart buffet strategy, you can't go wrong with this place for a cheap belt-loosening meal."}
{"text":"I've come here for the dinner buffet before which I enjoyed the serving trays are smaller making the chefs replenish them more often so you get fresher food, I also like the mongolion bbq station, so I give dinner 3 stars.  Decided to come here for lunch one morning and I did not enjoy it, 1 1/2 stars for breakfast.  It seems like it's pretty hard to mess up breakfast but I did not enjoy it, and I usually enjoy all breakfast food.  I get much better food in my employee dining room at work. * Only come here if you use your boarding pass $2 off or if you have a coupon for BOGO (buy one get one free) other than that I think theres better buffets out there."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions for dinner. The price is discounted if you have a players card. You will encounter long lines on the weekend - it is to be expected. I have always received superior service from the staff.  I enjoy the salad bar, the meat carving stations (prime rib, ham, turkey) and the fried shrimp! The dessert is really good too. It's a great place to take out of town guests.  I wish they would introduce new items more frequently."}
{"text":"Typical buffet. Saturday night is shrimp and prime rib night(it's $3 more than a normal dinner night).  The breakfast is actually outstanding. It's $6 with the rewards card. Why pay the same at a fast food chain for a biscuit and coffee when you can get a hardy breakfast for the same price."}
{"text":"We come here often.  BIG TIP:  go get your free player's club card before you go to the buffet, you save $5 a person.  This buffet has never failed us.  It is one of the best deals in Vegas.  I love that it's not on the strip and filled with tourists.  I love the extensive menu choices.  You have Sushi, Italian, Mexican, Southern and a carving station.  There is a huge soup and salad station and don't forget desserts.  You can order their signature alcoholic beverages for $3 (Skyy Vodka).  If you love southern food you will find braised oxtails, black-eyed peas, sweet potatoes, corn bread, greens.. OMG  so good  Don't miss the seafood.  This changes depending on season, but last night they had fish 4 different ways, shrimp 3 different ways, black mussel and green lip mussels and an assortment of sushi.  I'm a sushi snob, so I tend to avoid them here, but I love everything else.  They also have some of the best raspberry ice tea we have ever ordered out."}
{"text":"Aweful experience and poor customer service. I do not expect that everyone should become so over the top animated Disney characters either but being rude and disrespectful to customers/guests is uncalled for and unprofessional. Waitresses avoid eye contact and brush past you as well as ignores you. No refills, no chance to ask for anything. Very sour expressions the moment you reach the cash registers and upon leaving. Food is mediocre and yet they raise the prices for buffet which is the only change made. Seriously, those sour expressions depict how much they hate their job or the people. The disgust is apparent."}
{"text":"This is a good buffet we came just in time for prime rib and red rocks feast buffet doesn't disappoint it was yum. My kids were impressed and we had a nice time trying all the cuisines with the kids. THIS PLACE ROCKS AND BEATS OUT RIOS SEAFOOD BUFFET!!!"}
{"text":"Thanks Wendy C for recommending this buffet. The cooked crab was delish. I had devoured two plates of crab and shrimp cooked in buttery spicy sauce! If you get there early you won't have any wait in line for the crab to be cooked to order.   As is the problem with any buffet in Vegas there was way to just to much food! Prime rib was decent and the fried chicken was crunchy and tasty. I did save room for a small piece of Strawberry cheesecake!   I probably would not return BC I'm not a big Buffet fan but would recommend this one if your into buffets."}
{"text":"The food here has great variety and is quite good. Prepare to stand in line to get in during peak hours. Try the ice cream it is terrific!"}
{"text":"Decent buffet for the price. As with all off strip buffets you shouldn't expect anything other than your normal buffet food staples. My only gripe was that the deserts were clearly from yesterday's dinner as the cakes were pretty stale and crusty, and also a few of the items like the orange chicken also tasted pretty old. All in all though  it wasn't too bad for the price."}
{"text":"It's still good; this time for champagne brunch.  The champers is awful and will most certainly give you a headache, but cut with oj it's not bad. If they have the Mexican been/cheese/egg conglomeration you'd be a fool not to get it.  It was great."}
{"text":"In a world torn asunder by the war between Thin Nation and Obese City, the corporations of the food scene give sanctuary to those who fight for their right to eat.

My fat sense tells me there are tacos, tamales, refried beans and rice in Mexico Land.  Down in Little Italy there is spaghetti and meatballs, pizza and creamed spinach.\"  \"Well I am glad to hear they have spinach but are there any other vegetables to choose from?\"  \"Dammit man! Look around you.  There is Ceasar salad, green salad, cole slaw, green beans, corn and hominy.\"  \"Mother of gastronomic redundancy!   Corn and hominy in one dish?\"  \"Indeed.  Try it, you'll love it.\"  \"This is great, Fatman.  I'm getting full now but I feel weak.  My sweet tooth needs to be replenished.  Can I find desserts too?\"  \"Do you even need to ask?  Take your pick.  Pumpkin pie, pecan pie, apple crisp, eclairs, ice cream, carrot cake.  It is all yours for the taking.\"  \"Thank you, Fatman.  You have given me hope for the future.\"  \"You have made me proud, my slender protege.  You have learned much in this short time.  We will fatten you up yet.\"  BOOM!"}
{"text":"Q: What would Las Vegas be without buffets? A: Only a fraction of the great city it is.  Q: What would I be without Las Vegas buffets? A: About 30 pounds less.  I like the feast buffets at all the Station Casinos but the one at Boulder Station holds a special place in my heart.  This buffet used to be in regular rotation for me when I still lived on the Eastside.  I was going there long before they updated to the Feast it is today.  An update I am happy about.  Before it changed, the former buffet was good but not great.  I usually got sick within an hour of eating there.  Not that it ever stopped me.  It sort of reminded me of that buffet in the great comedy classic \"Vegas Vacation.\" Sometimes the food was not identifiable.    Now, however, the Feast at Boulder Station is top notch.  The salad bar is always fresh.  The Mexican section has some good food.  The Chinese section has great orange chicken and egg rolls.  The place is now modern and more classy than before.  It is clean.  The service is good.  Drinks are always filled as if by magic.  I leave for a new plate of food and when I return, my drink is filled and my empty plate is gone.  Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"Among all the other station casinos, Red Rock is my favorite! It is rather new, elegant and clean!"}
{"text":"There was a bug on the table the hostess tried to seat us at, that kinda ruined my will to eat there, and the food I DID try was mediocre. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Went there for celebration of my daughters last day of school, she didnt even eat anything - said it all looked gross. I made the mistake of eating a few items only to get severe diarrhea and vomiting shortly after! It was cheap, but not worth being sick for 2 days"}
{"text":"A group of 5 guests at the hotel ate here every day during our stay from Tuesday through Friday for breakfast. Service was excellent each day. The food quality was consistent on each visit. 2 out of 5 of the guests are serious foodies, myself included. But even foodies can take the overall situation into account in their assessment of a dining experience.  For the price, the value was good. Overall food quality was acceptable, considering the low price. Scrambled egg dishes (with or without cheese, mixed with sausage or veggies) were consistently over-cooked, rubbery and about what you'd expect from a typical cafeteria serving large crowds. Hashbrowns  were likely pan-fried from bags of frozen, shredded potatoes, often with clumps of salt on top due to uneven application of seasoning. Bacon was usually crispy. Sausages were bland and mealy. Most of the diners enjoyed the Eggs Benedict offerings, but only if they were fresh from the kitchen. I thought the Mexican station's items were decent, though surprisingly bland. Cinnamon buns were acceptable. Orange and Grapefruit juices tasted like watered-down fruit punch. Coffee was mediocre. All diners agreed that the breakfast pizza was awful. Pancakes were dry and inedible. Waffles were okay. Doughnuts were mediocre. Hand-carved ham was decent.  For a quick, no-frills breakfast with excellent (and always friendly) service at a low price, it's a win. It will not please those who are in the mood for well-prepared food made with love by passionate chefs."}
{"text":"We had a good dining experience. It was relatively quiet the service was pretty good and the food was as fine as any of the Feast buffet lines. Nothing jumped out that would make this a memorable trip."}
{"text":"This buffet is consistently good I have eaten here probably 8-9 times and have enjoyed it each time. The staff is on top of the food presentation and friendly too. I will eat here many more times!"}
{"text":"Food is good for the price. The service at this place is TERRIBLE! I came in with my family of 8 and I was on crutches. The lady who sat us had a complete attitude and was so rude. She rolled her eyes and when I asked to be moved closer she sighed and said, \"there's no available tables\" (The buffet was empty at 8am). To make things worse she sat us at the farthest table, if you can imagine being on crutches and having to walk back and forth with a plate of food, who wants to do that? I'm huge on service so needless to say, I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"My friends and I have frequented Red Rock's Feast Buffet for a few years. We always found the dinner menu delicious and filling. Our last visit, this past weekend, was a totally different experience. We tasted several different dishes, as usual. We found the Mexican food greasy; the Chinese food greasy, the kielbasa  had to be discarded, and the fried chicken didn't taste like chicken. We called over the maitre d' to ask what the problem was. He checked with the head chef and came back telling us that they were using new recipes. We asked him to tell the chef to go back to the old recipies. Don't fix what's not broken. Since we were unable to finish any of the dishes we chose, we have decided to find another buffet to take our business to. It's a good thing we used our playing card for a discount and had a coupon. It wasn't even worth that."}
{"text":"Staying in Summerlin for the weekend we wanted to try out this place. Heard it had been voted best buffet in Vegas, so that must mean something. We first went on Saturday around noon, but the line to get in was so long we turned around and left. Must be good, right? Returned for a second try on Sunday and the wait was minimal so we stayed.   Reading some of the reviews we had high expectations. Sadly they were not met. First, we were seated one table away from the shoulder height partition between the casino floor and the restaurant. Basically, we were seated in the smoking section. The place was busy, so asking for another table was out of the question. We had already paid so we decided to stay.   The waitress who helped us with beverages was super helpful and friendly. No complaints there and we left a nice tip.    The expectations we had around the food were not met. As vegetarians there are usually limited options, but most buffets now try hard to meet those needs. Here, not so much. Aside of tofu, omelette and mashed potatoes I could find nothing to eat on the buffet that met my vegetarian needs. The salad bar was basic (lettuce, tomato, cucumber, carrot and olive stuff). Other items I could eat were some rolls and cheese.   Many reviewers had mentioned the amazing dessert station and gelato to die for. I may have missed something. That station was far from amazing and by far one of the smallest dessert stations at a buffet I have ever experienced. It was pretty standard buffet stuff and the gelato was like any other out there.  Perhaps our expectations were too high for this buffet. This was perhaps on par with any buffet found at Native American casinos around the country. For Las Vegas, we were a little puzzled by the \"best of 2015\" award."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend are frequent buffet goers and for the location, is the best buffet to grab a satisfying lunch or dinner. Their food is always noticeably fresher than most other buffets. The selection is more varied as well! Not just the typical same-old-same-old buffet food items.  The service is also great! I've never had a problem with the servers and the hostess' are always friendly.  Above all, the price, the location, and the food is a winning combination."}
{"text":"What a great buffet! Located in the Red Rock Casino just about 30 minute drive from the strip. The food was consistently fresh. They included a wide variety of meats, seafood, veggies, and international cuisine that your hearts desire. The price is about $30 per person with a players card. Players cards are free to get and well worth it due to the savings. Try the Brisket. I couldn't stop eating that. The dessert were delectable and the salad bar had everything you could want and more."}
{"text":"Everything tastes like leftovers. Never anything new. Nope......not going again. After waiting to have our money taken by the not so friendl"}
{"text":"Whole party got FOOD POISONING!  Happened last month and thought is was a fluke. This used to be one of the best buffets....no more."}
{"text":"I've read the Reviews on the Santa Fe Feast Buffet, Some Good - Some Not So Good! Well, for Me...it was Okay! There wasn't anything wrong with the food, the service was a little slow, waited a while for our drinks, and our plates piled up& the table was getting a little crowded before she cleared the plates up!   There is one thing that I will say....make sure you come before 3pm, because they will tell you to leave at 3:45, Why? Because they are getting ready for Dinner at 4pm. But they will ask you before you pay the cashier! Just a little heads- up for ya! You're Welcome... =)  I would compare this to the Sunset Station's Feast Buffet, but a Little Smaller!  Oh, I almost forgot....get a Player's Card from Station Casinos, You'll get a Few Dollars off the Buffets!"}
{"text":"Food was aight. You get a $5 discount for two if one signs up for a player card. Service was good. They're nice. Gave my mom a flower."}
{"text":"Preface:  Nice setting, bright lighting. Always busy, hence good food turn over.  Average buffet-type food. Some items good, some not-so good, but inconsistent in quality. Great bargain, except pricier on Fridays and weekends.    A part of the Stations Casino brand, the Feast is located inside the Red Rock Casino Resort and Spa, a locals casino in the Westside of Las Vegas, next to the new Downtown Summerlin. The Feast Buffet comes nowhere close to a mega-huge glam buffet like the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's, but it's good for what it is, a locals' buffet.  It's my favorite of all the Stations' casino buffets.  Hubby and I typically spend an couple of hours lingering here, getting food, eating, chatting, repeat.  It's really an enjoyable setting, and that's what we really like the most.  My one vexation is the inconsistency in food quality.  There doesn't seem to be a basic formula the cooks all follow.  On the same night, as different batches of chow mein are brought out, for example, every batch looks and taste different. One batch might be dark, soy-sauced covered, and another light in color, with a totally different taste.  Unfortunately, because of this, it's difficult to even recommend certain items.  You just need to wander, see what appeals to you, and give it a try. I've never ever liked their sushi though, and would not recommend that at all. However, there's usually one or two standout items to choose from, being that there's an Italian, American, and Asian station, along with a couple of carving stations serving up turkey, brisket, steak, etc., depending on the day.  The salad bar is huge, and is one area where they excel in consistency.  For the money, it's worthwhile just making yourself a large salad, getting a slice of turkey and then splurging calorically on dessert.    One thing for sure, you will get value here.  For locals, they're always sending out 2 for 1 coupons, valid Mondays through Thursdays.  For dinner this evening, we paid a total of $18.39 for 2 people, that's $9.19 per person, if you show your Player's Card, which can be a card at even the most basic level.  This includes bottomless sodas, iced tea, and hot tea.  Really, how can you beat this deal?!?   We normally avoid Fridays and weekends here, since we're not huge shrimp and prime rib folks, which is their special on these days. There's also an additional charge, something like $19.99, but don't quote me on this price. You can get about 80 percent of these exact items Mondays through Thursdays for about half the price.  Although the Feast can't be defined as  destination-worthy, it certainly is worth a trip here if you find yourself in the Westside, or maybe after a shopping excursion at Downtown Summerlin.  After dining here, you can also catch a movie at the cinemas located by the food court, or make a \"donation\" at the casino.  We always end up doing one or the other."}
{"text":"This has now become one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  If you get a chance to come to the Green Valley Ranch Casino (in Henderson, NV), you have to eat at the Feast Buffet.  I brought my Boyfriend here for the first time, and he LOOVED IT...we ended up staying past its closing time...hehe!  Note:  Stick with the sauteed Crab legs (and shrimp) - Also, ask for \"Everything & Spicy\"  (its not really spicy, but you get a LOT of flavor when you ask for everything...)  If you don't try the Sauteed Crab legs and Shrimp, there is no need to come here because you can basically find everything else at any other buffet.  Also, the staff is extremely friendly and attentive.  It is one of the best services I've gotten.  There was no need to ask for more napkins, soda, utensils...it was all brought to the table before you even thought about asking for more..."}
{"text":"This place is worth the value :) Especially if you have a buy one , get one coupon that they mail out.  We have eaten here now around 5 times.  There are many choices such as fried shrimp, broccoli rabe in garlic and oil, lots of chinese food dishes and spanish foods and an Italian section.  My kids love the pizza and garlic bread.  They have lots of soup and salads.  The tomato and mozzarella salad is really good.  The dessert section is really good.  They have really good spumoni gelato and other yummy flavors too.  The staff is really friendly too."}
{"text":"I still don't know why I stood in line that long. When I got seated there were many open tables. My waiter forgot about me and left for they day. Had to flag someone else down to get a dirt flavored spiked sprite and he told me that my guy left. Not cool! I'm thirsty bro!!! The meat counter, veggies and fresh fruit was tasty. WARNING: Eat all prepared dishes at your own risk. Tastes almost like the same nasty water was used when preparing them or they just decided to cook with a new seasoning called nasty bits. If anyone drags you in to \"eat\" here, stick to what you know o_o  seriously! and finish up with the strawberry soft serve...mmmmm  oh! And the price was good except the wall said 2.00 wine,but I was charged 3.00 for my Moscato. What type of beverage is Moscato now?...2stars well deserved!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this buffet! It's within 3 miles of me , under $10.00 for lunch and we always get buy one get one. I have strict dietary needs and the chef always does a walk through for me to tell me what I can eat and what to stay away from. With a players card you don't have to wait in the long line. They are always busy but never a long wait, except for when they have buy one get one on certain days.   I wish they changed their menu more often but their dishes are consistent in taste and quality . I usually go right at 11 and there is always fresh food.! They have a huge salad and fruit bar and every dessert you could ask for! Even though I can't eat any of it except the Italian ice. The first time I came they had a coconut dairy free ice and never saw it again, it was delicious.   The decorations in the place are also appealing to the eye.   I eat everything with chopsticks, even my Italian ice and sweet potato :)"}
{"text":"My in-laws were in town, and they wanted a reasonably priced buffet with seafood. We went for their Sunday bruch, and were very satisfied with the selection. With fresh sushi, clams, shrimp and even smoked salmon, it was the perfect place.  I would give 4 stars for the food, maybe even 4.5; however, 3 would he given for our server. She never returned to check on our table until I found her and asked for a refill on our tea. We got our refill, then she returned as we were leaving to bring even more tea.  Anyway, for $13.99 Sunday brunch (with the Boarding Pass of course), it was a great deal."}
{"text":"We have been here many times over the years, as it is comfortable and the selection of food is usually pretty good. This time we had a coupon that we received in the mail for '2 for 1' buffet when using your Station Boarding Pass. The pass is easy to get, and it is free. Even if you are just visiting, be sure to stop by the Rewards Center, or sign up online for a free Pass. Not only does it offer a discount at The Feast Buffet, but you earn points when playing the slots and various other games around each Station Casino.  We came here today specifically for the salad bar, which is usually pretty awesome. There are many different options of greens, as well as toppings and dressings. The other side of the salad bar includes jell-o cubes, cottage cheese, sliced fresh fruits and various pasta salads. This time however, the selection was very limited. It all looked fresh, and the salad bar was clean, but many of their usual selections were missing.   My husband also decided to get a slice of roast beef and some roasted jalapenos. I went back on my second round for a few slices of bacon, which are always tasty but sort of limp due to the mass quantity in the heating dish. Eggs benedict was also an option, and the sauce was flavorful although the english muffin was not even toasted.   All in all, we still enjoy this buffet as their is such a wide variety of food. Asian dishes, pizza, breakfast items of all kinds, sliced ham and roast beef as well as many desserts...some of which are sugar free.   One thing we always do is add the tip for our server at the time we pay. This way it is taken care of, and we do not need to leave cash on the table."}
{"text":"It's more like 2.7 star.  I'm not crazy about any station casino buffets, they are all pretty much the same food. But this place have more variety of the food compare to the other Feast buffet. Oh, and this place had kimchi."}
{"text":"The best part is the buffet on a Saturday night was only $9.99! They had Asian, Italian, and American food. Everything was great, however my husband did not like his tilapia fish. They had soft serve ice cream and hand scooped, even Spinoni. We only waited about 15 mins to be seated and our waiter was very efficient and nice."}
{"text":"I saw feast buffet through buzzfeed and they liked it so I decided to take a trip here while I was in Vegas.  The food is good and inexpensive just as long as u get a station pass. The BBQ station is the best here than other hotels. The disappointment is the Asian station.....I don't know where they went wrong, it looked really good but was very bland.  It's 15-20 away from the strip but it's worth it. Dinner was good but the breakfast was great.  I can't forget about their staff.....friendly and caring especially towards families with kids. Thanks Feast Buffet if u read this. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Feast was disappointing at best. The food was low grade, but truly what do you want  for ten bucks?  The service was good and at 9:30am there was no wait for breakfast.  If you are looking for a super cheap buffet then you have found your spot.  In my opinion it was save yourself  a few  bucks and get an an Egg McMuffin and a cup of coffee at McDonalds."}
{"text":"Hands down the best buffet to have in vegas. $9 for lunch? Can't beat that. They have every form of protein you can think of here. If you cannot find something to eat at this buffet, then you are a lost cause. Burgers, fish, chicken, pastas, roast, turkey, and I'm just naming some of the items that were on my first plate."}
{"text":"Never dissatisfied. I don't know how this place has such low reviews. They have everything you are looking for and very family friendly. The prices are incredible."}
{"text":"I have always loved the Feast buffet, great buffet for the money. Kids love the sorbet area, and pizza. I love the mashed potatoes! The rolls are yummy too. We always go for lunch being on the East coast time zone makes lunch like dinner for us. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Good bang for the buck buffet.. It's been awhile since I've been here, but I go for dinner. They had hand scooped ice cream.  It is cheap.  The meats were decent.  Not 5 star quality.. but it isn't bad. You just need to find something you like."}
{"text":"I paid $6.48 for everything in the breakfast buffet with drinks so I'll expect a buffet worth $6.48. They had my pancakes, eggs, sausage, and fruit. What else do you expect for that price? This isn't even on the strip!  That's all I'm saying."}
{"text":"First time at the Feast Buffet @ Green Valley Ranch.  We went on a Thursday night and the spread was pretty substantial.    Crab legs was the highlight.  You can cook the crab in any style you want.  Every table you passed had crab legs!   The prime rib was really good, juicy and rare like how I like it.  Top up with horseradish and you're good to go!  There was a pasta station and they had linguini and clams.  It was pretty good.    The pizza was delicious and fresh out of the oven.  There were also roased garlic in oil on the side and you could eat that with your pizza.  I actually put some in my salad!    The chinese station was not too bad.  If they have the chicken with the bean paste, go for it.  I've never eaten chicken so tender and with that type of paste before.  They also have char-siu pau.  Yum!  The soup & salad bar was extensive.  I had the split pea soup and ham.  It was pretty good.  For salad, I decided to put one together on my own.  There were some platters with pre-made salads.  Dessert was extensive with an ice-cream bar.  They could even make you milkshakes if you wanted one!  If you sign up for the player card, you can get $2 off your buffet."}
{"text":"The Feast Buffet at the Red Rock Resort & Casino still remains as one our favourite buffets to go to outside of the strip. Whether it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner, they always serve up a wide variety of dishes (American, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, and Mexican cuisines to name a few) to satisfy your cravings. Don't forget to save room for dessert, aside from the cakes and pastries (even sugar-free variants) there's also gelato! Be sure to come in earlier than planned though as the lines often peak into long waits."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst out of all the Buffets in Vegas.Let me give you a few points why...   First off,when we got there they promised that they would  give us 35 minutes to eat,they also promised that no food would be taken away,instead we found that half the food was gone.  Second,there was a very rude pasta chef that was ignorant and refused to cook our pasta.This was very rude since all the other Station Casino's buffets cooked without any resistance,even though it was only 8:40.After I complained to the head chef,he hesitated in making the pasta and once We tasted the custom pasta,it turned out that it was the worst pasta we've ever tasted.   Third,At 9:00 about 80% of the food was gone.This was very inconvenient as we were still very hungry and desired dessert.The waitress informed us at 9:20 that it was the last call,as promised by the cashier.ALL OF THE FOOD WAS COMPLETELY GONE. Every chef was gone,All of the machinery was off.   Overall:If you want terrible service and no food that fills you up,then go here,If not then I definitely recommend Fiesta Rancho or Palace Station. Those locations have better service and are significantly cheaper.   BTW:I would give negative stars if I could."}
{"text":"Date: 03/21/2012 Wednesday Time: 10:08 AM  My intentions were to eat at a breakfast buffet. I arrived at Green Valley Ranch \"Feast Buffet\" and the waited 48 minutes in line. The cut off is 11:00 AM. So I stayed for the $7.99 lunch buffet,(with the Players Card- Free ) I obtain 5min before standing in line for free.  This is certainly a 'Quantity over Quality\" place. I did eat at the Fiesta Lunch buffet for lunch, a few days ago. And they are both own by the same owners. This lunch buffet has better ingredients / items, than the Fiesta Buffet, but, it still 'okay\" based on my overall experience.  The highlights would be the Bass, Tuna salad, and they do have pita bread with hummus and plenty of greens. That alone - I would rate 3.5 or of 5 stars for non-meater eaters or flexitarians.  Customer services was okay. More than likely, I won't be returning.  Food: 2 of 5  Service: 3 of 5 Price: 3.5 of 5 --------------- 8 of 10"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with some friends from out of town.  The prices are about $7.99 with rewards card. For breakfast there is not much of a selection. They should also have turkey bacon or beef hash. I just was not impressed.  I had French toast and they didn't even have powdered sugar for it. I did like the omlette station and was able to veggies and cheese and that was pretty tasty. The other good thing is that they started putting out lunch right before we left so they had a little better selection.  The food is too bland.  Also I have a 2 year old and 4 year old and they had to pay full price.  They can't eat as much as an adult, lol. I am guessing that they do this so you won't bring kids.  They get one star for the food, but their service was good. The waiter was super nice and attentive.  Hopefully they will make the some changes to their selections."}
{"text":"We decided to come here on a Saturday for early Father's Day Lunch. Surprisingly, there wasn't a line like at the coffee shop. We were seated quickly and we began to feast. I started off on the \"sushi\" side. There was some spicy tuna rolls, California rolls, unagi nigri and shrimp nigri. None of which was even remotely good. I then decided to try the mac and cheese (yes, I love mac and cheese) and rotisserie chicken at the carving station. This was both good, but some parts of the chicken was dry. I also had some chicken noodle soup and that was full of yummy deliciousness, probably full of MSG but it was good! I was full after that (it was only lunchtime!) and I went on to the dessert. I like that they have an ice cream bar here. However, this time I tried three different mini cupcakes the red velvet, chocolate and vanilla. They were all good, but not great. For the price of $9.99 for lunch and for those of you who have a boarding rewards card, I think its a go!"}
{"text":"Although the hotel \"sucks\" this buffet was something to talk about.  It was free because of the misfortune at the hotel but I would have gladly paid to eat here.  The food was way better than most buffet I've been to in the past.  Probably because the selection was vast and the food was seasoned very well.  If you go to Las Vegas with the kids this is a great bargain even if you have to drive from the strip (13 minutes)."}
{"text":"This review is for Sunday brunch, which I used to go to quite frequently. This is definitely the best buffet I know of in regards to value. The price is great for what you get, and being at the Red Rock instead of a normal station casino makes this buffet better than those ones because Red Rock is a little more upscale in general (though the price of the buffet is the same). Anyone who has been to the other Feast Buffets can tell you this one is a muuuch better place! Love it. Although I do have to say that no matter who it is that is scooping up your ice cream, they always seem like they hate their job, always pretty unfriendly lol."}
{"text":"Awesome buffet! Great food plus we had 4 free buffets from playing myvegas. My grand daughter loved the chocolate chip waffles. They have a great omelette station and lots of other great choices."}
{"text":"It was hard for me to give this place only 1 stars as I have been coming here for years. It has progressively gotten worse. I actually hadn't gone there for a long, long time and just went recently with my wife and remembered why.  It's funny when people try to get you to try something and they tell you it tastes like chicken. \"Frog legs? Tastes like chicken!\" \"Squirrel? Tastes like chicken!\" well on this night my chicken tasted like fish! They had obviously fried the chicken in oil that was used to fry something else. The Mac & Cheese had broccoli bits in it and tasted like broccoli! That is ridiculous! Boiling pasta in water that was used to boil broccoli! STUPID and low class!  The food is OK. Not great, but not the worst either. I've actually noticed improvements from my last visit. many things (tags and plaques) are miss labeled, which I find to be a huge \"no-no\" at a buffet. The service is why I give it only 2 stars. Several unmotivated servers with no personality makes it hard to enjoy your meal. Especially when you are spending most of your meal trying to flag them down just because they don't bother to stop by and ask how you are doing. My server on this last visit came to ask for our drinks, as I turned to look at him and order my drink he looked away and NEVER made eye contact with me. This is cause to not be trusted in my book. I never trust someone who can't look me  in the eyes even if only for a split second. After bringing our drinks I wanted to ask for more napkins, but he walked away too quickly and my  mouth was full. I then spent several minutes with a tag team effort between me and my wife trying to flag him down. We could have just as easily walked over to the drawer and grabbed some napkins but this is what he gets paid to do. Here's my problem. I consider myself to be a generous tipper. I don't go by percentages. On a $20 meal I would have tipped this guy maybe $6 or $7 which is at least 25%. More than most people tip at a buffet. The no eye contact issue knocked a couple bucks off, and the hunting down and waving knocked a couple off. In my first ice tea I had a lemon though I wasn't asked. In the second I had no lemon. Very inconsistent, I could care less about the lemon, I'm not one to make a scene. By the time we left he ended up with a $2 tip which my wife said was too much. I could not leave without tipping since he didn't piss me off by any means, he was just unfriendly.   Either way... unless someone invites me to Sunset Station Feast Buffet and I can't get out of it by suggesting another location, I will never eat there again. Sorry Sunset Station."}
{"text":"The reason this buffet is so cheap is because it is understaffed, nearly unstaffed. I wouldn't be surprised to get food poisoning here. It is a ridiculous maze through the casino to reach the buffet, whereupon you're anti-greeted, especially if you don't have a players card. My drink server accused me of sneaking in, then served me drinks that had interesting bubble patterns..."}
{"text":"As far as buffets go this is a good one. Reasonable price and fairly good selection."}
{"text":"Great food. But when the buffet is busy, you might have the waiter or waistress that does a poor job. You will have to grab them just to order drinks. And at times, your drinks can arrive after 20 minutes. But overall, the buffet looks great, it is clean, good variety of food, and most people that works in the buffet are nice."}
{"text":"Because we stayed in the hotel, it is very convenient to eat there. The food is delicious, service staff is good, too! The most important is the price is very competitive in Vegas area!"}
{"text":"The price is very affordable even at the usual rate with the boarding pass. My fiance and I also play MyVegas for complimentary rewards and discounts so we also had a voucher for a BOGO deal. Upon signing up for their Stations Boarding Pass we were also told that as new members we would get the chance to \"Crack The Vault\" and win a random amount of points (every 1000 points = $1). It's also pretty neat that you can use those points not only for games, but you can use it towards your meal as well. Score! The buffet at Palace Station is located upstairs. On a Sunday afternoon, there was about a 25-30 minute wait. With the BOGO discount and points we won from the promotion we only paid $5.25 or so for two people (brunch). There was not a huge variety, there was some good food but most of the entrees were bland. The prime rib looked good and juicy but was actually pretty dry. Do not even attempt to eat the chicken fried steak or french toast. I was disappointed in the dessert station and didn't try anything as nothing appealed to me. My fiance was not fond of the chicken noodle soup, he much prefers the soup at the Mirage the day prior. I liked that they had mini beef tamales, not bad at all in my opinion. The omelet station was good as well, the first time I walked by there was a small line of approximately 3-4 people. I decided to give it a try and there was only one person before me. Cook was nice and the omelet was delicious. I was actually sad I didn't eat the omelet first and could not enjoy it as much so late in the meal. They have a section for the dry cereal, but I think it would be more accommodating to the customer if there was milk available near by so that you would not need to get a hold of your server. Our dishes were removed about 3 times during our meal, not bad. Our server was nice and helpful. I was a little down that we hadn't tried the buffet at Red Rock hotel (sister hotel) instead, but for the price of $5.25 it was still a great steal!"}
{"text":"We got coupons in the mail for the buffet so we decided to try it. It's up the escalators. There was a very long line- could they have gotten the same promotion? The selection was decent. It could fool you, since both sides are the same stuff, just at different ends. The food was not good. The desserts was probably better than the food itself.   We ended up going twice to see if maybe we came on a 'off' day (but regretted it). I agree with pgmj, that it's along with \"Circus Circus terrible.\" The service was good. The atmosphere isn't that good- kind of dreary and depressing- a little dark. BTW, I probably like the Green Valley Ranch buffet out of all the stations casinos."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday for their seafood buffet, with only one goal in mind--to stuff my face with snow crabs.   For $26.99 that's not too shabby of a price to pay compared to the higher end places on the strip that charge $45 per person.   I wasn't too fond of the prime rib or anything else. The sushi wasn't bad for a buffet, but it's just buffet stuff.   They offer steamed crab, and also iced crab. I was super stoked about their crab action."}
{"text":"Cheap and good buffet ! Always clean, employees are friendly and smiling. I recommend to get the Station Casino rewards card for best prices"}
{"text":"Good buffet with a very large choice of food ! Price is cheap , employees are friendly with smile. Food quality is average and not a lot of choice for american food."}
{"text":"Being a local, I find this place good for its price. It's an average buffet in Las Vegas among many top buffets in town. They have Asian, Mexican, salad/soup, and Italian sections, you could order your personalized pasta in the Italian section, which is pretty good and fresh. The dessert section is so small with limited options. I would ignore going on holidays, because it'll take you max 2 hours to get in. The most annoying part about this buffet is the waiting line, which is ridiculous with all the open tables they have, I don't understand how hard it is for them to clean the tables and let people in!"}
{"text":"First casino we've been to off the strip, very impressive at first. Selection was nice and cuisine options were nicely balanced. Food flavor is what makes this a difficult 3 star to write. Hoping for the better food you have on the strip. Price is too much for the quality of the food. Southwest regional food is their best flavored section, imho Staff are very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"So as a member of the frequent Players Club I received a coupon in the mail  for a two for one buffet. It cost us $9.72 for two for dinner and we pigged out on amazing food. Granted it was not super duper but the food was pretty good and of course it was a buffet so there were plenty of options. Certainly well worth $9.72 . Get yourself a player's card if you live in Vegas and you will receive the coupons in the mail and you can enjoy this special treat every month or so."}
{"text":"Sadly this is the worst feast buffet of all of the stations. Fiesta Rancho runs closely behind in this category. Has the least selection, the specialty orders are always completely overwhelmed, the staff seems short handed and overworked to the point they seem to be forcing a smile. We get coupons or comps all of the time and enjoy using them at local stations. Unfortunately most of our comps are at Palace which I enjoy very much and like most of the restaurants such as the Oyster Bar (great 2am late night). Also The Broiler has great food, although the environment is no comparison to any of the steakhouses at the other stations."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when we came here....I think this place had me at Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, my FAVORITE coffee place, ever.  The dessert selection was good and they had some really good ice cream, not like the dingy kind where you only have vanilla, chocolate, or swirl.  Also, the entrees were delicious...I especially liked the baked brisket and pasta selections.   To top it off, the price here won't break the bank....get a Preferred card and buffet meals are half the cost.  I'm looking forward to going back for dinner tonight!"}
{"text":"I was seriously disappointed with the quality of food. There was a large selection of food but the quality was seriously lacking. I've had frozen for that tasted better. Come on station casinos you can do better."}
{"text":"Good food and a wide selection. Priced a little higher than your average buffet (but then again, it's better than your average buffet). The only downside is, I found the desserts subpar. I tried many different pies, and they were not very good. Some pies lacked enough filling, where it was difficult to tell exactly what I was eating (it was basically just whipped cream on top of pie crust)...and even the pies that did have the proper enough filling, the flavor was not very satisfying. Also, the ice cream (which was ok), was ruined because the whipped cream on top was warm. But inspite of the lousy desserts, all the entree's and appetizers were very good, so this place still deserves a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"I will base these reviews on the last two times within a two-week period. I have eaten at the buffet about 30 times in all my years. I left for 5 years for San Diego and just moved back literally a couple of miles from the hotel. I was bragging to my friend how exceptional you were as it was her first time.  Firstly I just want to share that I was a former F&B Director at highly regarded properties in San Diego and La Jolla, California and also a former F&B Director in Las Vegas. I also have held positions as Buffet GM in Las Vegas. So with that being said I wanted to share briefly a few thoughts. First visit.... I have a server who was definitely was past her prime. And I don't mean that in a derogatory fashion. It's just she doesn't understand guest retention and customer attentiveness. Simply it's not her forte any longer. I won't say her name but it started with the letter L as I don't want to cause any embarrassment. Simple requests like asking for additional clean silverware so we wouldn't have to use the same cutlery for all of our courses seem to be a big chore for her. So I'm sorry to say I took your clean silverware off tables that had yet to be sat. I realize it's not protocol but having a non attentive server forced my hand. Immediately when we were about to be seated by a very friendly host person and I believe her name is Mercedes. Kind, gentle, beautiful smile. The server brought drinks to us that we had not ordered so it was no problem. I understand she made an error and delivered them to us by mistake.  I told her and she served them to the adjacent table. I went ahead and I just requested two waters with lemon and her response was, \"I'll be right with you sir I'm putting these drinks on another table.\" Outstanding I told her. We waited for a couple seconds and she looked at me and I repeated my two glasses of water with lemon request. And the service went downhill from there. Did not offer coffee, dirty plates stacked,  just a poor service experience. On a good note I've always been impressed with your food. I won't list all the items but I can tell there's attentiveness by the chefs. The only drawback is half the buffet line is missing their food identification menu badges. I asked one gentleman in the adjacent seafood section what the item was and he didn't know and shrugged his shoulders. But the good team member he was he asked the adjacent line attendant in Seafood and she came over and told me they were Vegetarian Sliders. Because I'm passionate and want your Buffet to be first rate I just wanted to share the positives and the concerns I had with the current F&B Director.  I called the day after and left a message on a voicemail that was not identifying himself as the Director. But that was the extension PBX connected me to. I waited a few days and heard nothing back. I then called and left a message for the property GM at his assistants line and just stated if he wanted to discuss my experience to please call me back. But I've heard nothing and that's okay. So I figured I would just put some of this in writing to let them know how they're doing.   Second visit today was superb only with a couple flaws. Mercedes as a host person again phenomenal and Rebecca as my server was the difference between night and day. God bless her. Brought another friend who had tickets to the complimentary Buffet and concert event in Rock's Lounge and we were looking forward to that. Again, the overall food was magnificent and thank you chefs for your efforts. Only two concerns. Again not having food labels to identify sauces and particular items I believe is inexcusable. And it's even exists on your salad station. The Buffet Manager needs to understand this is not okay. It just comes with being thorough and a perfectionist for presentation. Secondly Seafood station attendant was replacing the sushi on the back half of the Sushi Boat where people could not reach it. And he just watched them struggle with short tongs. I tried and struggled. The next lady gave up and I asked him to push the sushi to the front of the boat when replacing. He said nothing but moved it. I went back 15 minutes later and he still was doing the same thing and I took photos. He just didn't care that your Buffet guest were struggling with the process and I was frustrated even though I'm not in the business anymore. Other than that I will return. I will tell my friends how magnificent your food is and I sure hope I get Rebecca again because I will request her. And if I just may offer a personal opinion. If your Buffet GM reads this may I  recommend a suggestion for his or her next pre-service meeting?  No matter how beautiful your property is and how magnificent your food is people usually don't return if service is poor. Sophisticated people don't take a chance on poor service. That's what they will remember and that's what should be emphasized during your meeting...but that's me.  Thank you for taking the time."}
{"text":"What can I say? Its a decent buffet. What I like about this buffet is that its nice and large and not all cramped. They have a nice flow of things and the servers are usually always awesome.  Pros: Breakfast  Price isnt too bad In Red Rock Nice selection Choc croissants Yogurt mixed with red grapes : )  Cons: You pay FULL PRICE for kids older than 3! Food is sometimes dry Sometimes the selection is crappy  Ive gone for breakfast and lunch, I have to say I really like the breakfast! Usually buffets are a hit and miss with me mainly bc I dont eat like a fat pig and Im picky. I love that you can have any drink for free, non alcoholic of course. I also really love the omelet bar! Its great when you get a nice fresh perfectly cooked one! I always tip the guy making it! Poor dude, hes busting ace trying to make 100 omelets. They offer your standard fair: eggs, bacon, sausage, country fried steak, biscuits, gravy, eggs benny, and on occasions burritos.  Lunch is about the same, burgers, wieners, Asian stuff, Mexican stuff, a carving station, and other yummies.  Here they also have a huge salad/fruit bar that is sooo fresh and delish, and they also have a grandiose sweets area. It includes gelato and sugar free options.  Here its not a bad price, 4.99$ for brekkie and 7.99$ for lunch with your players card. What I dont like is that I have to pay full price for my 6 year old son. Why am I going to pay the same price as a grown man would?"}
{"text":"5 stars for a non strip buffet? YASSSSS.  So, I'm not your typical Elite. I eat at cheap places, I don't go to Europe, and I definitely don't stand on top of chairs to get the perfect photo of my food, which in turn gets cold. I'm the anti-foodie, foodie. LOL. BUT I know good food.  I've never been here before, and kind of scoffed since it seemed like a \"janky\" hotel/casino. I was looking for somewhere that wasn't going to cost my son and I an arm and a leg to eat breakfast, but still get the options. So, I took to the interwebs. I first looked at Santa Fe Station then here... the reason I chose here is because of the tex mex food items offered. Off we went.  We parked in the garage, and to get here you have to walk through the casino. It's a great idea to do that, especially if y'all gorge yourself. I see you.  The line was semi long, but went by quick! Breakfast (Mon-Sat) is 6.99 with a players card for those 2 and up. Lunch is 7.99 with PC, Brunch with champs (Sun) is 9.99 with a PC, and dinner is 9.99 with PC, unless there is like a specialty night, but you can look that up. We ended up getting here at 10:30am so we got to eat both breakfast and lunch. You know how some places make you go away, or won't put lunch items out, or will karate chop you if you try to take some green beans? They do not do that here!  The cashier was nice, as was the hostess. Irma was our server and she was amazing!! Love her!  Inside is quite large and very spacious! I was actually blown away with how many items were offered. If you read other review, they hella dog on this place. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot you just spent 68.99$ on that meal.... RIGHT. Well, here even though you pay under 10$ it's quite impressive. The place is clean, and doesn't stink. The tables are actually super nice, as is the seating. Unlike The Orleans, gross.  FOOD!!! We had their breakfast offerings: french toast, waffles, chicken fried steak, tater tots, bacon, and pime rib. They literally offer SO MUCH. Prime rib for 6.99? WTF?! All of the items were pretty dame decent, the french toast was not flat as a board and the chicken fried steak was not greasy and disgusting. The prime rib was cooked medium rare, but they had rare and gross aka well. LOL. Sine we got there when they were changing over the breakfast items, we also had the chance to eat lunch, this is where the magic happens!!!  POZOLE!? TACOS AL PASTOR?! ALBONGIAS?! WHAAAAAAAAAT!!!!!!????? Ay guey! Yes! They have this! And a reliable source told me they prepare everything IN HOUSE. And that the others cough *red rocK* cough is actually canned! And believe me, you can definitely tell! The pozole was so effing delicious! The taco, ayy que rico, and the albondigas were so tasty! Coming from a straight beaner, this is the real deal! They also have many other Mexican offerings, they looked delicious!  The other offerings included: real charbroiled burgers, they even char the bun on the grill!, stroganoff, green beans, so many pizzas!, pastas, chow mein, spring rolls, sausage, a salad bar, and insane assortment of deserts! They offer sugar free, reduced sugar, and regular! The desert area is effing huge! I tried the peach cobbler with vanilla soft serve, OMG. I also had a reduced sugar blondie, WOW!!!! They also have pumpkin pie, banana cream, german chocolate, mousse, and SO MUCH MORE.  I didn't get diarrhea, so this is legit my new favorite spot. Obviously this review is for breakfast and lunch, haven't been there for dinner. I've been to many a buffet - high end to low end. Trust my review.  YAY!!!"}
{"text":"If your a local you know there are many more buffets better than this. You get what you pay for and for $5.99 i dont think it can get worse than this place. All the food was bland or cold or store bought. Nothing made there but the pizza that is once frozen and thrown in the oven. If you want good food. Do NOT EAT HERE. !! Go to the brunch buffet off the grill in the Mandalay Bay or samstown casino. !"}
{"text":"Read the great review in the taste section of the Review Journal last Wednesday and the pictures of the Feast buffet at the Texas station.  My friend and myself decided to go on Friday evening 5/30/14.  It was the worst buffet I have ever eaten at.  We arrived around 3:30 pm paid and went in.  The waitresses were not friendly at all.  The staff behind the stations had no personality at all.  The food was not changed over in most stations from lunch to dinner.  The fried chicken was so overcooked that you could not even eat it.  When I asked for fresh it was really juicy and tasty.  The Asian section was overcooked and the food was not moving at all, the chef would just throw back in wok, heat up and put back out for service.  The only person who was friendly was the young man behind the pizza stand.  I would not recommend this buffet to anyone, crossed this one off my list, never to visit again."}
{"text":"Have been going to the Feast Buffet at sunset for many years.  The food is just getting worse.  Sometimes the food is cold and not moved around.  The servers behind he counters never change their gloves, wipe the counters and then prepare food with the same gloves.  The roast beef is never rare, very well overdone.  They had salmon a few weeks on the buffet and they took It away for some reason.  No good and needs to be inspected."}
{"text":"Is this the best buffet in the world? No. Is it well worth the price? Absolutely.  This buffet is about value and ambiance. It is in a beautiful hotel with a beautiful area for the buffet. My fiancé and I enjoyed eating here very much and found the employees to be immensely helpful and friendly.   For the most part all of the food was fresh, there was a good selection, and I wasn't really disappointed in anything. As long as you're not expecting world class food at a buffet, and you realize the price that you're paying, you will be pleasantly surprised with what Feast has to offer."}
{"text":"We finally made the long drive to Red Rock Resort during our Vegas vacation last month and tried the buffet.  At $10.99 ($1 off with player's card), the weekday lunch buffet at Red Rock Resort is a very good value.  For me, the best items and the only ones I went back to for seconds were in the Mexican station and the most disappointing were the desserts.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  There was a long line even for late lunch but it moved quickly.  Not bad at all!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Should be called the beast.  Yikes."}
{"text":"I believe tonight will be my family's last visit to this buffet.  With 2 kids under 5, this place has become UN-kid friendly. As of June 17th 2012 kids under 2 are free. So we basically have to pay $12.99 for my 3 year old son to eat. Screw that!! When my husband and I only pay $13.99 with a players card why the hell would I pay $12.99 for my 3 year old to drink apple juice and eat greasy macaroni with a few pieces of fruit?!  Whoever made this change in their pricing must be out of their mind. Nice way to lose customers.    Another annoying thing is how slow the line moves. After you've paid you have to wait to be seated. If its taking a while to seat people then that means those who have paid are still standing right in front of the cash register cause there is nowhere for them to go. So the cashier just stands there and waits until they are out of the way to ring up the next person. All this goes on while the cashier at the \"VIP\" register stands there and chit chats because he has no body in his line. One would think he'd ring up the next person from the normal people line, but no he doesn't. Us normal folks must not be good enough for that.   By the time you get seated you are so annoyed!  Now I'll get to the food. It's ok. Your standard buffet food.  It's the Feast so you have Asian, Mexican, Italian, American, a carving station, salad bar, Mongolian grill, and desserts.  I'm pretty sure I didn't miss anything. Oh, we visited in a Friday night at 5:30. There was about 10 people ahead of us and it took 20 minutes just to pay. We didn't have to wait to be seated cause our party was already inside.   There is nothing special about this buffet. I wouldn't be sad if I never went there again."}
{"text":"lunch - weekday - used casino card.  service was not that great.  had to stalk the seater for server.  then stalk server for beverages, napkins, and refills.    +sausage cut on top of spaghetti +roast chicken +cornbread +gelato  -fried chicken -mac n cheese -steamed broccoli -no choco cake  would rather repeat buffet at Texas Station  - ribs are included there, service is better."}
{"text":"Ok at best. $10 if you have a player's card. Normally $17.  Pros: the desserts. Soft serve and pastries, nothing too special though...  Cons: no vegetarian options at all. Careful on the rice and vegetables as they use chicken base.  My friend who eats meat wasn't able to finish a single item stating they were overlooked and tasteless.  Overall, there are much better food options elsewhere in the hotel. When I asked the manager about their vegetarian options, their annoyed response made it clear that customer service is not that important to them."}
{"text":"Easter buffet with no ham available and no carrot pancakes. Most food is either stale from sitting out to long or warm at best. Service is excellent but expect more from Green Valley."}
{"text":"Not bad as far as price.... Food was ok.... Not the best but decent considering how cheap it is... Some food was seasoned perfectly ... Others were a little too salty for my taste ... The dessert was alright..."}
{"text":"I would have gave 5 stars... But I brought my family and grandparents for breakfast and after breakfast they wanted a slice of pie. The lady is cutting the pie for lunch and said we can't have pie it's for lunch she was so rude ! Then pancakes were horrible waffles weren't good. Pancakes tasted like something was done wrong or a weird taste to it. I didn't understand why Mexican section was separated from everything on the left end I didn't see it over there because everything else down there was closed . I walked over there toward where the guy is making omelette and seen Mexican breakfast . Menudo. Chilaquiles were super good!!! To bad I was kinda full already . Food was ok. And our server was really good. He was kind enough to bring my grandparents a slice of pie so he made up for this visit :)"}
{"text":"One of the Staton Casinos located on the south side of Henderson.  We came for Sunday brunch. The price was very reasonable but the wait was over an hour. While we were in line we could see several of the same tables open for the whole time we were in line.  The brunch does come with bottomless mimosas and champagne.  I was impressed with the food selections. The selections are far better than the buffet selections at other Station Casinos."}
{"text":"Tip: get the free Players Club card to save money on the buffets.  We came for Sunday bottomless mimosa brunch. The brunch was $14.99 with the players club card. We walked in about 1:00pm and were seated in 15 minutes.  The buffet is large with many choices from breakfast items, Italian, Mexican, Asian, BBQ, steak, salad, pastries, and dessert.  The food was decent and the buffet area was very clean. The mimosas were ok tasting.  Good value for the price."}
{"text":"Buffet located in the Sunset Station casino in Henderson.  Tip: get the boarding pass players card. You will get points and discounts on food and they will mail you 2 for 1 buffet coupons. It is free to sign up.  We came for brunch on a Sunday. Brunch is from 8am to 4pm and includes unlimited mimosas. The buffet is pretty large and offers breakfast options as well as regular food and dessert. The food is decent but the price makes it worth it."}
{"text":"We drive into Vegas from the CA side several times a year. We always make one of our stops Green Valley. I know that they are now part of the station casinos but this is one of our favorite ones. Very clean, nice decor, not smokey and they have my fave place in the food court, Coffee bean and tea leaf. I love going off strip for buffets because they all serve Pepsi where the strip is strictly coke products. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I couldn't find anything worth eating, even for the inexpensive price. Dinner was only $9.99 with a Station's Card.  I arrived at 7:30p.m. and most of the food had been sitting under the heat lamps for well over an hour. Dried out sub-par pizza, hot dogs reminiscent of a 24hour seven-eleven rotisserie, and a tiny tex-mex section that should never have emigrated from tex-Mexico are some of the fare options diners are subjected to.   Save your money and get your fill elsewhere."}
{"text":"Weekend lunch here isn't as bad as the buffets let's say downtown or in similarly priced buffets. We used to visit Sweet Tomatoes to have a healthy-ish lunch buffet on the weekend but for the same price or less actually we go heere occasionally.   Selection is truly varied and some cuisines are more Americanized than others; my faves are the sushi rolls, the salad area, the Chinese area and carving station. Desserts have been well picked over and just way too American (huge and too sweet) for my tastes at lunch. You are usually presented with cookies, brownies, pies, muffins, ice cream made to look like sorbet, some warm deserts next to a self-serving soft ice cream dispenser. The only desert at lunch I can tolerate are the cookies and occasionally the molten chocolate cake with some vanilla ice cream on top. And nearly all desserts are offered sugar-free for diabetics, too.  At the salad bar, enjoy the quinoa (red), farro (wheat berries), assorted prepared salads, fresh baked bread, sweet cream butter and of course veggies washed and set up for your own salad. I usually eat about two plates of salad before trying sushi rolls or anything heavy.   Also beware that this place is NO SECRET and the lines are long. Have your payment and players card ready to speed things up. Prepare to spend a good hour just waiting to pay then waiting to sit and then roaming to eat..."}
{"text":"This buffet was so good! I enjoyed myself very much and the atmosphere was great. The place was very clean and I will definitely be staying at the red rock next time I visit Vegas"}
{"text":"Came in at 3pm and most dishes are empty. No employee wants to help, pretending to be busy...  truth be told none of the dishes taste good either. Really a very bad customer service and very poor taste in variety of food and not really tasty food!!! I'll give zero star if I could"}
{"text":"I ate breakfast here and it was amazing!! Buffet was cheap but food was great. Very friendly staff and food was fresh and hot. They had a huge variety of food. Make sure you get a player's card to receive a discount. It is free to get the card."}
{"text":"If you have, a car or any reliable transportation then what are you waiting for. Leave the Strip and head on over (it is only about 15 or so minute drive) to a great buffet! Sure, it isn't the Wynn or even the Cosmo but heck for $18.99 per person you are treated like a Queen (or King, Or Princess).  This is a huge buffet and it clean. The possibilities are endless here. Our host was nice as she took us to our table, and said we could start anytime we wanted to. Drink orders were placed and Minh and I were outta there. Both of us were starving like a marvin and ready to take on this buffet one plate at a time!!   If my mind can remember, (it was an all you can eat extravaganza) there was:  -Crab Legs (Stir Fry is an option here) -Shrimp -Mongolian BBQ -Prime Rib -Turkey -Fried Chicken -Salmon -Grilled veggies -Fresh tortillas -Guacamole and pico de gallo -Shredded pork -Lime rice -Mashed potatoes (and wedged potatoes) -Assorted breads -A salad station (either you could make your own, or they had pre-made salads). -Korean spare ribs   I think I totally carb myself out on this trip. After three plates, I was calling it quits.   After waiting for my food to settle, I went back for desert.... There is not a huge selection sadly but they did have some great tasting treats including sugar free options as well.  -Mini red velvet cupcake (it was ok tasted kind of old) -Various cheesecakes -Lemon Meringue pie -Ice Cream and Gelato -Pie shooters -Fresh fruit with whipped cream   Our waiter was kind as our glasses were re-filled each time without asking, and out plates were cleared by the time we got back to the table.  Leaving the buffet, we were thanked for coming in with a smile. Service you do not see that often anymore!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy bussing your own tables, after paying over 30.00 per person for a mediocre buffet, this is the place for you! Service was TERRIBLE!"}
{"text":"We took my newly wed Sister and her Husband, here after their Vegas style, wedding. From start, to finish, we had a great experience.   We were in a long line, and probably waited a whole hour, for them To accommodate 15 people. Once in, service was prompt. Drinks were served. Food was 5 star. No complaints. Great Prime rib. My favorite was the cream of spinach. Desert bar, ok. My Grandson wanted crab legs and there were none. The cost was only $13.99 per person, so I didn't think there would be crab legs.   Not a bad buffet at all, for people who don't eat $50 worth of food."}
{"text":"Best of my favorite buffets? Always a favorite of mines especially that at this buffet at the dessert station they serve hand scooped ice cream!!!!!! then for the price and with my stations card even better yet!  make the way out to henderson and you gotta try it not crowded at all and way different crowd."}
{"text":"We were regulars at The Feast at Red Rock, and have watched the quality decline tremendously.  This past visit, we said \"No More\"!  There was nothing really good.  The sushi was dried out.  There were 2 stations offering the same bbq pork - one was burnt and the other had so much vinegar, you couldn't taste anything else.  The macaroni and cheese was bitter.  Even the desserts were lousy.  We upgraded to Red Rock from Sante Fe when their food went downhill.  Station Casinos has lost us as buffet customers."}
{"text":"A year ago this place would have gotten 5 stars, but it is not what it once was. That being said it is still very good for a buffet. I do miss the crab legs."}
{"text":"Located in the Santa Fe Station Hotel Casino. This is one of the better bargain buffets. I went on a Saturday for lunch, the first thing that jumped out at me was grilled to order hamburgers and hot dogs, and a serious carving station. Ok so they were a little slow in replenishing the pizza. But overall if I found myself in that part of town I would be happy yo make a return trip. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Located in The Red Rock Resort Hotel Casino. This buffet is a step above most 'local' buffets, it is a just a little more expensive but it's worth it. They make all of the dishes in small batches so it comes out fresh and is replenished right away. The salad bar had all kinds of prepared salads, the Red Beat Salad was a favorite of mine. the prepared vegetables were all very good, me saying that is a big deal, I hate vegetables, but here I was a fan. the Prime Rib was very good (for buffet prime rib) There was a wide selection, I am not sure that I got thru everything before I couldn't eat another bite. Well worth the trip out to the West Side. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}

This is one of the better bargain buffets. everything was fresh and the coffee was good (trust me this is an issue at some buffets, you know who are) It's not a destination but if you are there stop in. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with my family. The scrambled eggs were cold, the bacon and sausage were way undercooked and the gravy was extremely runny. The place was pretty dead for a Saturday morning and now I can see why.  The server was friendly and the place seems clean, but that doesn't make up for undercooked food."}
{"text":"It is a popular and busy buffet. Expect a bit of a wait if you're not a rated player or hotel guest because those lines are shorter. Right now you can add on an all you can drink beer or wine for $8 more.  Notable are the large beets that are sliced like patties. Very popular and special."}
{"text":"It was basic, not very visually appealing, buffet food. Came in BBQ night, and ribs and chicken were pretty good. Salad bar was fresh and tasty. Basically institutional good otherwise created to feed the masses, and masses of people there were."}
{"text":"Foods ok.  Cheap if ur an adult with a boarding pass and u drink champagne.  However; if u have kids,this is pretty expensive since the age cut off is 3 n under. All in all, 3 stars for an average rating."}
{"text":"Red Rock is by far the best station casino in town. It's in a better and newer neighborhood. Walking through the casino to the buffet doesn't make you cough from secondhand smoke. I can't rave about their buffet though. You can't expect too much for the boarding pass price. Sometimes they'll send locals coupons for dining too. If I had to pay the full price, I probably would pass on this Feast Buffet. I've posted prices and hours as a picture. It's no Bacchanal people. It's alright quality food, and you won't find many dishes that will amaze you. It gets the job done if you are hungry, and there is plenty to try and many options for picky eaters. My boyfriend complained that all the breakfast items did taste pretty much the same, but we weren't surprised. I have yet to try their seafood dinners on Sundays."}
{"text":"This buffet is located inside the Green Valley Ranch Hotel. I for here exactly at 4, when they opened. Tonight was seafood night. $35 with club card and $40 without. If you don't have it, they open it for you right away when you're in line.  What is different about this buffet on seafood night is they satay your crab legs!! No other buffets will do that. They also give you the option to have steam or cold crab legs. What I didn't enjoy was some crab legs were empty!! I was so mad!! All that cracking and barely any meat!   They have a pretty food variety of dessert and also have a Magolian grill.   If you're in this area and want crab legs, this is the place. However, I'd you want other stuff, maybe stop by another restaurant. This use to be a really good buffet but since then, the rest of the options have gone down hill."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  I heard a lot of good things about this place.  But all the food was cold the meat was rare.  I just did not enjoy it."}
{"text":"Okay 15 bucks isn't bad, but the food is nothing to write home about, everything there was something you'd get in a microwave diner, but of slightly higher quality, best part was the roast beef, but the guy cutting it was really rude and didnt seem to want to give me a second slice. Okay that being said about the food let me tell you why I'm giving this place two stars, not cause of the food but because of the shady business practices, they add gratuity to your bill, but I still decided to give then extra top at the counter before you get sat, after being sat and our drink order was taken they took my receipt and then shortly returned with a new receipt, where the gratuity and total line were blank.... So not only did they get service charge and extra top from me but they had the audacity to try and trick me to give them more tip, I have worked in the restaurant business my whole life I have seen this trick before and I do not approve of their shady business practices"}
{"text":"Stand in line for 45 mins , get no hello the girl seems super confused with 2 people helping her and just the one register open and then get charged for brunch when they charged the people ahead of us for breakfast... and brunch is the same price as the expensive weekend dinner. Slow slow slow. Better off going to Sams town buffet!!!! I rarely post negative reviews so you know that the service was atrocious, but maybe I'm picky since I work in customer service. But the basics are smile and say hi... but u won't get that here!"}
{"text":"I'm really embarrassed to even review this place but the value here cannot be beat. Like everything in life, the diamond can always be found in the rough. When you're carbo loading for the week and you have a cheat meal to fill, I recommend skipping Olive Garden's endless pasta menu and heading straight here for their custom seafood pasta station! Made to order! Who does that? Fresh shrimp, garlic olive oil, penne, parsley and lemon ! Endless!! Need I say more? Just skip everything else because I'm sure you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Look it's not going to win awards for innovation but after the dreck at the Flamingo buffet this was nice. Unpretentious, decent quality, more than fair price (esp compared to the gouging on the strip). I found plenty of fresh fruit and veg (including a great cucumber, onion and fresh cilantro salad), fresh grilled burgers (I was there for  lunch) and quick service. Decor has been updated recently and there were some spots that seemed a bit quiet - where you could actually relax and enjoy your  meal LOL For my money, it's a good value."}
{"text":"Having a nice dinner at \"The Feast\" buffet.   My server Lori was very attentive to detail.  Her service was appreciated and very efficient.   The baked chicken was perfect, very tasty!   I recommend this buffet.   P. S.  My previous reviews taken about line cutting being a problem, seems like the issue has improved.   No problems in the last 4 visits."}
{"text":"Without a doubt a waste of money. We usually go to Alliante buffet but wanted to try something different well we should have not and stick with we know is good. Anyway there is not a big selection in the different categories of food and the stuff we grabbed was old and did not taste that great. The only good thing about it was our server and that's it. Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"Years ago, this was one of the best buffets in town. Based on my 11/8/2017 lunch experience, it is now one of THE WORST. I sampled tiny portions from all the entree sections: Food was either bland, dry or or rubbery (meats). Salad bar dressings were all much too salty. Pie crust on desserts was watery and flavorless. The ONLY thing I found tasty was the chocolate icing on the mini cupcake.   Service was good but I won't be going back.   Very sad for an otherwise beautiful resort."}
{"text":"Hey folks! I'm not giving 5 stars because this is a 5 star  zagat rated establishment but because for overall food quality, value, cleanliness and friendliness of the staff. Solid for me. Originally 4 stars now 5----they gave a gelato bar!!"}
{"text":"Out of all of the Las Vegas buffets I have ever been to, this has got to be the WORST! I am not a picky eater. I usually don't complain about food and I can usually adapt my taste buds to most anything. This shit, I just couldn't!!!!! The TEXAS BUFFET was even better than Aliante! I just honestly was all around disappointed! Most of the food was seriously room temp, not hot. Everything had pork in it. A lot of the stuff was dried out looking from not being touched or mixed. IDK, like I said, I rarely complain about food. I just can't get jiggy with the Aliante buffet! I usually give a place a second try but I wont be doing that with this one!"}
{"text":"Cheap mediocre buffet food .. Place recommended by local friend. $8 non player price for breakfast, $10 for lunch food. Omlette station, fried food, and mongolian BBQ was about all that's worth the mention.  On par with NCL cruise ship buffet.. Not a Carnival or Princess buffet quality or taste"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Just added some picks. CHEAP ($6.99 for dinner NOT BAD.) but not much of selection. Nothing special- standard Las Vegas buffet food. Service is good though."}
{"text":"BEST of @stationcasinos Buffets @RedRockLV   still boring & bland. Nice decor but it always falls short!  Service was ok this time but a lot of dried up uninviting crap on the buffet.  For $18.88 pp I expect better. Next time Cabo's lesson learned!!:("}
{"text":"it's $8.99 per person weekdays so it priced right for a buffet but the food is very bland, they have american,creole,bbq,pizza,salad bar,mexican,asian,and a few others i can't remember. the drink ladies are fast at clearing the plates & filling the drinks which is the only bright spot in an otherwise drab dining experience. we have been here several times & everytime we leave saying we are never going back but they send us free buffet coupons in the mail.the pork ribs are actually pretty good. the pizza is supposedly brick oven baked, but it really looks like the oven is just for show. the salad is almost frozen because they keep the salad bar so cold. the desserts are all dried out because they slice everything and set it out all day. the turkey is dry the ham has blood spots which i never see at home when we make it. the ribs are decent but nothing special all the breads are hard as a rock and the soups are just rancid. the mexican section is always a huge mess with everything spread into everything else. the pizza is stale and very tasteless. honestly out of all the photos above between the 3 of us we didn't even eat a plate full. i was filling plates simply for the photos. really buffets are just gross it reminds me of the great deppression soup lines.if it wasn't free i wouldn't even bother. don't waste your money!!"}
{"text":"Decent buffet. Went for weekday dinner. $67 for two kids and two adults with their players card. They had bbq pork buns, which made me happy. They could have had more soup selections. Desserts were nothing to get excited about. They have a good selection of gelato, though. Overall, the selection was satisfactory and the quality was meh, but everyone knows you get what you pay for, so I wasn't disappointed. It filled us up, the food was warm, it wasn't terrible, and we didn't get sick afterwards. 3 stars!"}
{"text":"The Texas Station around the world buffet  Where to start with this place. I guess it's still a cheap buffet under $10, you do get a free game of bowling.  But it's a shitty casino in an even worse neighborhood.  The buffet is the highlight of the place and that's not a good thing.  They buffet service is always quick & friendly.They still serve your drinks which is nice.  Now for the food. Blah-yuck. They have a nice variety from chili,mexican,made to order fajitas, soup & salad, Italian & pizza, Southern with Ribs & Chicken, Asian, Home Cooking with meatloaf,fish,chicken and veggies, then their seafood and deep south with crawfish, and the like.  Nothing is very good it's like they can't use any seasoning or spices because they are worried about offending or tuening off one person. So it's just bland.  I leave this place everytime saying never again but for some reason, usually a comp, I end up eating here and regretting it from the first trip to the buffet. I usually come back with  half a plate wondering why am I even wasting my time."}
{"text":"Standard buffet issue. Same as the other station casinos-nothing flashy or fancy-but they do have specialty nights here.  It was fairly good but nothing spectacular, $10.99 per person. No line was the best part.  Prime rib was way too raw but brisket burnt ends saved the day.  I would do it again with a 2 for 1 coupon."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a one star because of the rude attitude and behavior of the manager (Dave). We were planning a party for 30 people for Oct 15. But we were told by this manager that they couldn't accommodate us and just go to Fiesta Casino. He could have said it nicer and more professionally but unfortunately that doesn't work for him. So I'll take my raggedy party somewhere else and they will never ever see me again."}
{"text":"I have only been here for a weekend brunch, and my party waited about an hour in line to eat, but I offer four stars for the service and the cleanliness of the buffet. A couple other things set this buffet aside from the typical offerings on the Strip. First, the price is better; second, the setting is classier. Third, the food is a bit better: they have an omelet bar, a mimosa bar and will cook your crab legs and shrimp in an awesome Bay spice mixture. The service is excellent. But that wait! Oh, that wait."}
{"text":"After shopping at Costco which is across the street. We decided to eat here because my m9m.had a 2 for 1 buffet deal.  And I must say the food tastes a lot better then other Station casinos.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We tried a number of the buffets in Las Vegas and this is among the worst.  Most of the food was old, messed up, dried out, or empty...during a fairly busy lunch.  The food that was edible was just OK.  Sushi was the best choice, as it was just passable.  Dessert area was boring.  Skip it.  Studio B Buffet at the M is sooo much better!!"}
{"text":"So it 2 pm, line for the feast buffet is huge. Just wanted some food. No place for my elderly mom to sit while we wait in line. Been in line for 20 minutes, it doesnt move!!"}
{"text":"Now this is not the best buffet in Vegas, however, I believe that it is the best VALUE in town. We mostly only go on Sundays for Brunch but the normal buffet runs around $10 for breakfast and lunch, $15-25 for dinner (depending on if it's a specialty night) and brunch runs $15.99 on Sundays. These prices are for if you have a players card and if you don't it's easy to get one, plus I recommend getting one anyways, because every month they will send you free $ to use at any of their eateries or buy 1 get 1 free buffets on top of the already great prices.  Now for brunch you also get unlimited champagne and/or mimosas for that $15.99 price. They also have all the breakfast items with an egg/omelete station, meat carving station with all the meats, international stations, a mongolian bbq station where you can get custom bowls made (also you can just get plates of shortribs cooked up for you - yum!), the salad bar and a fun dessert section (you can get mock coldstone ice cream).  The line will get long so I recommend coming at noon or before :)"}
{"text":"10.99 Adult lunch and 7.99 Children during their lunch. I went on a Saturday right before their lunch rush thank god. I couldn't find their prices any where until I got to the cashier which was pretty frustrating. Great price but the food wasn't special at all.   Food: 0/5  Like I said, food wasn't special. They had a sushi bar that had your Americanized California rolls or the tuna roll. They had an area for Asian stir fry. Also an Italian area where they had pizza and spaghetti. They also had an American area with a roast and other BBQ & your dinner side dishes. I didn't see much of \"lunch\" in their selection.   Salad bar: 3/5 I really liked their salad bar, it had fresh greens with different salad dressings with a few choice of soups. The only bad part of the salad bar was a lot of their salads were pre dressed and I don't like heavy dressing on my salads so this was upsetting.   Desert: 3/5 The desert bar was pretty good, it had a small variety of pastries but they have quite a big selection of ice creams. I don't like ice cream so I just asked for a chocolate moose pie and had a frozen yogurt ice cream cone.   Service: 5/5 I had a really friendly waitress, she was very sweet to my niece. This place being a buffet I really appreciated how quick the bus boy and waitress would take away our empty dishes. It gave us more room on the table which was much appreciated."}
{"text":"I can never go wrong at this buffet.   Only $9.99 with players card of course. Ive been coming to this buffet for decades now and the quality is still worth the price. Asian, Italian, and American food is served, but my favorite would be the newly added section where you choose your Italian Pasta ingredients which is then cooked to order! (I know theres a name for this Lol) For the kids, another station besides the regular deserts was added with approximately 10 flavors of real ice cream and not that fake custard crap! XP  Service has never failed. Just make sure you call and ask about the pricing for kids since ive been hearing different numbers through the grapevine."}
{"text":"GVR and Red Rock are the best buffets in town!! Service could be better but it's still great!!"}
{"text":"This place isn't even that bad!!   If you've grown up going to Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral you'll be fine. I mean, everything here is edible and is gonna end up in the toilet so these bad raters need to stop being total DIVAS!!!!!! The ones who depend on ramen for survival have it worse.  It's a cute place to take your family of 8 if you're poor and just got paid from your landscaping job. Good memories.  HIGHLIGHTS: - the food is good and thoroughly-cooked; you're not gonna fucking die I'm sure they have their health cards! - cheap (probably the cheapest buffet in town) you get what you pay for. Don't expect Bacchanal-quality"}
{"text":"The Feast Buffet at GVR is always clean and inviting. Service is acceptable and at lunch you can get a fresh rubin or grilled ham & cheese at the teppan station. The selection is decent and they have spamoni for desert. If you like deals get a players club card and you can eat breakfast for $5.  That said, sometimes the line seems to take forever to move. If you do a teppanyaki they only use ground meat (not good.) I am yet to see a crab leg at the place. They also kick you out between meals. We met for a business lunch and just hung around the table reviewing paperwork (not even drinking soft drinks.) The place was mostly deserted and they came over and told us we had to leave in 5 min. Ok, not eating, not drinking, not preventing anyone else from having a table. We left. I guess they were worried we would pay for lunch and get dinner....gasp! wait, no crab legs, yeah we were not waiting for dinner service.   For the price it is just okay, we usually just go over to Sunset Station or the Rio."}
{"text":"During the week the line is usually short. Good selection of food. They have crawdads for lunch, not sure about dinner. I dont think they server crab legs for dinner. There is nothing spectacular but you should find something to satisfy your hunger. Service is good. Clean and inviting. It is a good value if you have the players club card."}
{"text":"For some reason I have never gone to a Feast Buffet in my 3 years here in Las Vegas, I also tend to yell \"FEEEEAST\" whenever I do go by one then laugh at myself because I never go to those.  Welp, I decided to finally go on a Sunday morning brunch binge and FEEEAST seemed like a good idea.  So the lady and I headed to Boulder Station and we were welcomed to a 30 minute wait, no biggie, $9 and change for some all-you-can-eat.  Everyone working was very in sync and efficient when it came to service, moving people in and out, it was quite pleasant to see such professionalism.  Anyways, I always do my best to try anything and everything.  Bacon - YES! It was decent, you can't beat all you can eat bacon.  French Toast - Spot on Tacos - No matter what I get, whenever I grab hispanic food I feel like a walking cliche.  From what I can recall it was pretty solid, I slightly prefer Sams Town AYCE Hispanic food, but I will be the first to admit I have no \"good\" taste for foods outside of Chinese and Sushi Fruits and Veggies - They seem to be always fresh, so good job non-obese people! (Yeah, stereotypes....weee)  I'm always a sucker for custard, is it me or does every buffet have the same exact custard machine because it's all soooooo good.  Service - Fast Atmosphere - Relaxed  I should definitely come back again to try the dinner buffet.  (Should)"}
{"text":"I made the best decision to come here high as fuck $8 ayce?! Can't complain. I enjoyed the bbq porkchops and the tater tots. The Mexican department needs carne asada and fresh tortillas that aren't all krusty and shit. Oh and the chicken fajitas gotta go that shit is all dry"}
{"text":"Such a steal deal for breakfast!  It used to be that $4.99 (with Station card) would buy you  AYCE breakfast items, and if you stay past 11 am, you can get lunch too.  It's a glutton's dream come true, however, a glutton I am not.  My parents are hitting themselves in the head for this, because we would always go to Denny's or IHOP for family breakfast...when all the while, they could have been saving $$ by just coming here!  We don't make that mistake anymore!  However, times they are a changing, so now the buffet price is $6.99.  Still not bad, considering that beverages galore are included!   So sad though, that awhile back, they used to serve these awesome crab legs - Cajun style - with the dinner buffet.  I don't normally like cracking  shells and getting messy with food, but the lady behind the grill always made it taste perfect that she made me want to work for my meal.  I don't know where it went, I heard the Oyster Bar, but idk for sure.   In any case, this Feast Buffet breakfast is good, the lunch, is Okay, and the dinner really isn't worth it without the crab legs. Still, the price can't be beat, and I almost feel like I am robbing them.  Whatever meal you purchase, there would be no problem eating your money's worth here."}
{"text":"Wow! The $6.99 lunch buffet here is AMAZING!  (And I hear the $4.99 breakfast is just as amazing). There is a Mongolian BBQ grill in the back, and it is phenomenal. (I got the Mongolian sauce. YUMMM! Be nice and tip the chefs a buck, its worth it.). Red Rock Feast buffet turned me off of all Stations' buffets, but this is totally different. Everything is either good or great. Deserts are buffet standard, but overall was super impressed and for $6.99, its an insane deal. Service was great even during the main lunch crush."}
{"text":"There are several reasons for the 5 star rating and not because it's a 5 star dining experience. I have been coming here for breakfast for many years. The reason is because of the awesomely low price for exceptionally high quality food and bountiful selection of items to choose from. For $6.99 with a player's card it can't be beat. All the Stations properties have undergone renovation with raising the bar on standards overall, so kudos to that. I don't stay here because it's off the beaten path of the strip, but I do rent a car and the drive is simple with easy parking. Also, it's never very crowded because it's one of those Vegas hidden gems that most people don't know about. For breakfast you'll find all your favorites including an omelet station and a Spanish selection. I'm not a sweet eater but you sure get plenty of selections, so if you like cake for breakfast you can have that too. The casino has been renovated so if you want to play a modern slot, or $3 craps in a nice atmosphere, it's available. Overall great quality food at a very reasonable price. Don't be fooled by the old exterior of this building, they have gone way out of their way to make sure you have class and quality together. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"It is true, you do get what you pay for, When I go, I know what I'm getting as far as food. They used to be good, now they are using low quality ingredients, cooked by chefs that don't give a damn as to the taste of their way over salted food , but alas I digress. My gripe is their cleanliness and adherence to even basic health standards, I know every employee must have a health card, but they forget often what it means.  It is bad enough, when customers who do not ever wash their hands touch the food tongs and spoons and pick food with their fingers because they cant wait to get back to their tables, then lay the entire tong onto food that others are going to eat. (Disgusting People) but when I see the employees doing it too, I wonder what else unhealthy they are doing. When I noticed this the other morning, and told the guy about it, he just pushed the tongs away, and ignored me. The manager that morning was of little help, but they will have \"The Talk\" with him. I think they need a surprise visit from the board of health. Paying 5.99 for breakfast should not have to make you sick. They love locals alright. $$$$$$$$$ that's what they love from locals."}
{"text":"Absolute best breakfast buffet!! They have a large variety of every breakfast item you can imagine. There is something for everyone. Service was also excellent, very fast and professional. Pricing is incredible, make sure you get a players card because they discount a few dollars off by using your card. I don't have one single negative about this place. Everything is amazing and sets the bar for what a great buffet should be."}
{"text":"I'm friend took me to lunch on a BOGO coupon. I hadn't checked the Yelp reviews for this buffet so I went in with no expectations.  The wait in line wasn't too bad so no complaints there. We were seated and there was a napkin on the floor. Not only did the host walk past it without picking it up... he actually stepped on it and kept moving. Sad.  I liked this buffet (especially for the price)! The food wasn't amazingly fabulous but it was good. There was a wide variety of choices and all my choices were tasty. I didn't waste much b/c it was all good. I had turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, green beans with mushrooms and onions (HIGHLY recommended!), and a variety of desserts. The only dessert that I liked was the apple cobbler with some vanilla ice cream. My friend and I agreed that there was too much thickening agents in many of the desserts that lowered the quality.  I felt that the decorator was nice with the exception of lion heads on the walls... didn't fit with the old town decor that I was sitting near. So minor that it's silly to mention (but I did anyhow. lol).  Also note-worthy, the woman clearing our plates and refilling sodas was excellent! On the ball and very friendly. I wish I had remembered her name to give her specific honors.  I recommend this buffet for a moderately price buffet with many tasty choice. Don't expect the quality you'd get if you went to a  $30 buffet b/c you get what you pay for. I believe that we got more than we paid for.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Closest buffet to my house and within walking distance if you really wanted to hoof it. It would probably take about half an hour. With that being said I have been to this buffet countless times. My parents love this place and consistently eat here and usually eat for free because they have so many points from gambling at Boulder Station.  The prices are on the cheap. CHEAP. You can get breakfast for $5.99. Okay, that's a whole buffet for the price of a combo meal at a lot of places.   I think it's a decent buffet. Usually they have a very large selection of Mexican foods, even menudo soup sometimes. The \"ethnic\" (see: Chinese) section usually boasts your typical fair and of course there is pizza and pasta. Meat station usually has turkey and roast beef, although on occasion they do cornish game hens or something else meaty-tastic,  Best of all is the omelet station. They can make dang good omelets here. Although I usually always go with ham, cheese and jalapeno. However my sister had a spinach omelet and to me it looked pretty tasty!  Anyway, it's a good buffet. Is the food sometimes sub-par? Yes. But sometimes it's really good. For the cheap price, I think it's worth the gamble."}
{"text":"ACK. I've been to a lot of \"Feast\" buffets, considering I am indeed a Vegas local, but this one in particular was horrendous! I am not sure if it was just that night or if this Feast buffet just is bad in general, but yikes.  Customer service: Let's start out with one thing, when someone asks you a question, you answer it, you don't reply with something random that wasn't asked. When we walked up to the front we asked the cashier if they offer a military discount, he replied, \"We offer a discount Boarding Pass members, you can go get a card over there\" (and he pointed). Uh, well, my husband didn't ask you about your boarding pass card (I know, I have one, I've had one since 2006), he asked you if you offer a military discount. So we walked over and got a stupid card because we were with my MIL and FIL. Two cards = discounted buffet for four people. BY THE WAY, we also ate at the SAM'S TOWN buffet three nights before this and they gave my husband a discount when they saw his military ID without him even having to ask.  Not done yet, so we get back in line and wait now that we have our Boarding Pass cards, and as we go up to the cashier, two people cut in front of us and she allows it. We moved up a little closer so we wouldn't get cut again and the cashier loudly and rudely tells us to \"STEP BACK, MOVE BACK\" (no please, just ordering us instructions).   The food was pretty horrendous and considering it was Saturday night I expected it to be better. I had a slice of beef and some peel-n-eat shrimp, everything else was blah. PLUS I had stomach pains the same night we ate here while I was laying in bed trying to sleep. Was it the buffet? Possibly.   Overall I am really displeased with the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station. My parents, and myself have often gone to the Feast Buffet at Boulder Station, which is closer to our home, and it is much, much better than this one, especially with their customer service.  I suggest the Feast Buffet at Sunset Station teach their cashiers to have a bit better customer service and learn to LISTEN to what the customers are asking rather than just blurting out commands to go and get a Boarding Pass card to get a discount."}
{"text":"The first thing I want everyone to recognize that this is in fact a buffet. I do not care to do buffets at all in fact most of the time I rate them pretty low. But this is not your ordinary buffet might I add! I cannot remember exactly how many types of different kinds of varieties of food they have here but they have a lot and if I ever felt over stuffed in my life this was the time I almost exploded.  I would never rate a buffet anywhere above three stars. But like I said this one is different because of all the varieties. There is a special chef in front of each buffet and by the looks of it everything is cooked fresh right off of the oven right in front of you. The food didn't just taste great but it was absolutely amazing and I had a little bit of everything from every buffet. I was extremely shocked how well made everything was. It's a little bit on the pricey side but it was well worth what I paid.  The group I was with was very satisfied but we were all over stuffed and I would say that is the only bad part of this restaurant. This place is located a few miles outside of the Las Vegas strip in a smaller city called Henderson. It is inside the sunset station casino and it's worth the money as well as the drive if you're willing to find really good food in Las Vegas. It's been a few years now but I would definitely go again and hopefully they have the same arrangement because it was well worth it."}
{"text":"For a breakfast buffet, it is not bad. There are definitely better buffets in the Vegas area but they also cost more.  I stopped in for breakfast.  Nice selection of your traditional breakfast buffet items.  A good value.  I was mildly surprised by the available pancake selection.  They offered 5 or 6 different types of pancakes for breakfast.  Service is nice.  Atmosphere is old school."}
{"text":"After doing the Renaissance fair in Oct, my guild goes here every time and we get our fill. One of the best prime rib, I have ever had. Has like six stations, all different kinds of foods. And their dessert has a wide range of food and is just overall a really great buffet."}
{"text":"This buffet used to be the best in Vegas, but all of a sudden they decided to remove the crab from the buffet, stating the cost was the reason.  No one had a little black woman adding so much love to their crab like CVR.  In the for of butter, seasoning, fresh tomatoes, cilantro, etc.  I just hope they don't loose customers this holiday season, because so many folks will show up expecting a feast of crab, not knowing the \"the little black woman\" and her great flavored seasonings are gone!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this buffet 2 stars is because the prime rib, pork roast and fried shrimp saved the day. This was our first time eating at this buffet, we are regulars at the Green Valley Feast Buffet and so our expectations were high.  The lack of variety and lack of knowledge on how to fry chicken golden brown with seasoning is shameful. And when asked if there was chicken that wasn't over cooked, the guy cutting the pork roast was like it's all from the same batch; like that was suppose to make it all better. When u can't get decent fried chicken at a buffet it's time to change the staff!"}
{"text":"I dont know why this buffet haven't received a lot of reviews,  I love this place, I tried several buffets like Bellagio, M, Aria, but so far, this buffet is still the best first of all, the seasons crabs, crabs is good, crabs with seasoning, added flavors into them are smackingly delicious The deserts are so goodddddd, they have all kind of brownies, cake, and smoothie, ice cream for u to try The crab cakes are also my favorites, asian buns are SO tasty, everything is so tasty and You eat everything for around 20 USD, WORTH IT It is totally Worth it  Definitely recommend !!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best buffets I have been to in Las Vegas. I really liked everything they had. Everything was fresh, tasty and off the hook. Even the service was really good. Wayne was really helpful and very soft spoken. He made us feel really comfortable and told us where everything was once he seated us. We had a great experience altogether and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Just ate here with my family and I have to say I'm very disappointed. The food was not that good , everything tastes like it's been siting there for a while and at the prep stations they told me they didn't have anything ready. There was grease dripping down from the vent above the grill and after I mentioned it to the cook he didn't seem to care. It was 10 dollars a person witch isn't bad ..... If the food was good. they charge full price for kids over 2 years, Service was good but that's not why we came here. Will not be coming back"}
{"text":"We waited in line for over an hour on a Sunday morning.  The VIP line wasn't much shorter.  My friends had vouchers for a free buffet from a Slot tournament.  I paid $13.99 with a players card.  I did not see a price list anywhere in line or at the register.  They were located in the Green Valley Ranch Resort and Spa in Henderson, NV.  The seating area was overcrowded with tables.  There were not adequate walk areas from our table to the buffet areas.  Service was a little slow to clear our empty plates and to get drink refills.  I was a little disappointed with the dessert selection.  The pies and cakes were on little plates.  There was not any flan or crème brulee.  The cheesecake was good.    Nothing was really outstanding.  I probably wouldn't come back and wait in line for so long."}
{"text":"This was my second visit for Sunday Brunch ($13.99) which didn't include alcohol.  We were able to use player points, so brunch cost $1.25.  They were located in the Red Rocks Casino in Las Vegas.  I had peeled shrimp, BBQ Pork Bun, and Won Ton soup which were good.  There was a long line for the omlette station.    The coconut cream pie and hazelnut cheesecake were my favorite desserts, which I had to ask for behind the counter.  After trying many of the other buffets in Las Vegas, this buffet is a very good value and I will be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking to be wow'ed by a Las Vegas buffet, look elsewhere, toots.  The Feast Buffet located in the Palace Station Hotel & Casino is very affordable for those looking not to spend a lot of money for an AYCE.  Here's my 2 cents on my mealtimes, in chronological order-  Lunch - A step-down from your local Hometown Buffet.  There is a grill where diners can ask for slices of roast beef/turkey, burgers, hot dogs & brats.  Located next to it, is a pasta station where pasta is made to order with whatever choice ingredients the diner desires.  The rest of the hot/cold foods were decent, but nothing extraordinary.  The dessert section was nice w/ various cakes, cookies, sweets and the obligatory nonfat froyo machines.  Overall, meh.  Dinner - See lunch, but w/ a few extra items scattered hither & thither.  Not worth the extra cost, IMHO.  Breakfast -  Now we're talking!  Several egg dishes, mounds of bacon, biscuits & gravy, country fried steak etc.  There is also an omelette station where diners can have an omelette their way.  The dessert section had most of the same items from lunch/dinner, plus various doughnuts and other items.    The Feast Buffet is an affordable, no-frills buffet.  I recommend breakfast over lunch & dinner for those interested in checking this buffet out.  I had free buffet vouchers, but if I had to pay, I would stick to breakfast.  Excelsior!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good, it sucks now . The food is dry and it either has too much seasoning or no flavor. For the price we paid  could've gone somewhere else and it also went up two dollars. We will definitely not be coming back , also we ask for ketchup and never got it."}
{"text":"For the price ($9.99 for dinner, $4.99 for breakfast take the 5 mins to sign up for the rewards card so you get the low price) it was great.  The breakfast was better than the dinner.  The food for both seem fresh.  The selectoin was decent.  You have to remember that you are off the strip so it's no comparison the selection of say MGM Grand or the Rio.  The restaurant was clean and look pretty new, and the service was good."}
{"text":"Good food selection, loved the roasted garlic. My five year old wants to go back there all of the time."}
{"text":"I preface this review by saying this is only for the Sunday brunch. With expectations set that this is a buffet I do in fact have to give them 5 stars. All the food that I had was actually very good including the hash browns bacon and even the sausage gravy. Weather buffets of gone to have sausage gravy that tastes like flower more than sausage. Here it actually was very good. The service was very good, and the drink refills or on time and when needed. For being a local casinos, I'm very impressed with the Sunset Station and would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Perhaps I wasn't that super hungry that evening after Christmas. We bypassed the long lines, but still waited for a table for our large group. I felt that the quality of the food was not that great. I was excited to try the different rice dishes, but to my dismay, they were all hard. There was too much meat that wasn't delicious (skipped the long line for the carving station) and not enough seafood. Their sushi consists of a huge ball of rice with a thin sliver of salmon covered on top. I only liked the desserts section, where the gelato and cheesecakes were my favorites. I was happy that they had cannoli and that was delicious. It probably wouldn't be worth waiting in a long line to be disappointed overall. I also didn't appreciate mislabeled dishes. I like to know the names of the dishes I'm trying. Service was fair, and our dishes were cleared out fairly frequently."}
{"text":"The prices have gone up at the buffet, probably to bring them closer to the upscale Strip-priced places that Red Rock has been rapidly adding to the roster.  The cute little self-contained glasses of wine have been replaced by Barefoot little bottles.  Barefoot isn't a bad brand, but we buy a whole bottle at Suncoast's liquor store on sale for just a buck more.  I wouldn't mind any of this if the buffet had maintained its previous high standards for food and presentation.  Alas, that's gone, too.  And now there's a two-hour limit - stay longer and they'll throw you out.  Our most recent foray was, again, for the Passover additions to the buffet.  Not that we don't eat all the other stuff, too.  But the entire buffet is now a ghost of its former glory.  Many of the holiday offerings - listed on a big cardboard sign in front of the entrance - were nowhere to be found.  Macaroons? Nyet.  Matzo Brei? Nein.  Potato kugel - yes, but totally tasteless.  Also tasteless was the ceviche, California rolls, and almost everything else I tried.  The brisket was pure fat, through and through.  Gelato was not gelato, but the most ordinary Chinese restaurant ice cream you've ever had.  A waitress was present in our section almost the whole time we were there, but she wasn't ours.  Our waitress was apparently out to lunch.  My husband spoke with two managers before we left.  One told him that, yes, there was a new chef.  He also said that before he became a manager, he used to be a customer, and he's noticed the difference, too.  The decline of the Feast Buffet is in line with all the other hellish changes that have taken place at Red Rock over the last year or so.  Put this together with the now 2-star rating for the Hotel and Casino, the removal of all the machines I loved to play, now replaced with glitzy, noisy one-armed bandits that truly are bandits, reduced payouts, reduced offerings for regulars, and you have a place that no longer cares about locals. And locals have fewer and fewer reasons to go.  What's their next move - charging for parking?  It's sad."}
{"text":"Last time I came here rated this place as a 3 star restaurant because the food prepared lacked taste but after coming back here, I noticed that variety of food options has greatly  been through a drastic makeover and now the food and desert is awesome.  On top of that the service they provide is top notch, Robin my server kept bringing in more refills on my rasberry tea.  She also had that friendly service and that killer smile that melted my heart only if I had enough funds I would have tip her big.  I am only going to rate it 4 out 5 stars because I still feel like there is room for improvement in this place."}
{"text":"If you're in Vegas and want all you can eat crab legs, then come to the Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch in Henderson!  It's a short drive from the strip and absolutely worth it.   Load up on plates of crab legs and have them stir fried and seasoned to your liking.  I usually get the works ... spicy with butter, onions, tomatoes and green onions.  Mmmm mmmm good.    Four stars because the rest of the buffet is okay.  It's the crab legs that keep me coming!  Every time I'm in town, I hit up Green Valley and the buffet!  We always leave happy and full.  Talk about kanak attack!  And for $20 a meal, the price and quality just can't be beat!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with family from out of town. There were seven of us but if there was eight there would have been an 18% gratuity tacked onto the bill. We still tipped well because it's a lot of work keeping up with us! There isn't a lot of seafood here but they have peeled shrimp and breaded shrimp. I liked the idea that you can request to have the peeled shrimp made into a Shrimp Scampi. They make it pretty good here ...it would come in second to The Cheesecake Factory's version of it. I also had the Prime Rib which they made really well this time. It wasn't too red and it melted in your mouth! Whenever I come here I have to make room for dessert because they have Gelato and fun little pastries. I like this place but I wish it would offer crab legs like Green Valley Ranch!"}
{"text":"I came here two weeks ago on a Friday hoping to meet up with a friend for a 3:00 meal. In this casino on a Friday having a meal at 3:00 is almost impossible unless fast food is involved. This Buffet isn't opened until 4pm for dinner along with the other restaurants in Sante Fe station.   If you like seafood come here on Friday it's seafood night. We showed up here on Friday but I was disappointed because I wasn't in the mood for seafood. Since we were already here we waited until 4pm to eat at the buffet. I had a buy one get one free coupon so I didn't feel too bad about the extra money I probably had to pay for food I wasn't going to eat.   The food is standard it has a salad bar, Asian, Mexican, Italian, BBQ and a crab station since it was Friday. The one thing that is different here is that they have a hamburger and hot dog area. The hamburger was good because you could customize it to your liking.   The pet peeve I had here was if you are going to close the place till 4pm please put out or clean the serving utensils. We were seated a little after four so I didn't expect to find sticky serving tongs and spoons so early!"}
{"text":"Definitely will be returning to this place on my next visit to Las Vegas. The American, BBQ and Dessert bars are the highlights of this place. I wouldn't recommend the International or Asian parts of this buffet though. That section looked tired and bland."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  This place has an all around the world style so there is something for everyone.  The only negative thing about this buffet is when it gets packed it can take up to an hour until you get seated.  Other than that this place is great and if you have a red rock boarding pass then you get a discount for Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner."}
{"text":"Breakfast Buffet Price: $5.00 with Player's Club Card Rating: ****-with Card ** 1/2-without  Bill, the daughter-in-law's Dad, invited me to this Breakfast Buffet the day after watching the final game of the World Series last week.  Frankly... I hate Buffets... that's with each letter capitalized, with exclamation marks HATE!!!! Why? Long lines. Over-heated or Over-cooked Food. Food that is dried out, that has been sitting for a long time. And even longer lines at desirable food areas. A LOT of waste by people whose Eyes are larger than their Stomachs.  Bill has Breakfast with three other retired Gentlemen at this Buffet. Their tactic, which he recited to me, was to arrive BEFORE 8:30am when not very many people have awaken yet. The right side of the Cashier's station is where Hotel Guests and / or Player's Club members queue up to enter Feast Buffet. At 8:30am... the length of the line was about a third of the left-side of the Station... Ha! Envy from the Left!  BUT, the wait to be assigned a table is longer than the wait to pay for your meal... a person uses finger gestures to signal to waiters at the Left and Right side of the Buffet the number of guests at the front of this next queue.  The most popular area was the Hand-Made Omelet areas... which there were two at either ends of the Buffet area. At 8:30am, the lines were five to seven deep.  I hadn't been to a \"real\" Buffet in quite awhile... it's interesting to see how a Buffet tactically fights waste by it's patrons... Some in-house prepared items such as Quiche, Bear Claws, and Filled Empanadas are only one-fifth the size of similar items found in the real world. If you like these items... be prepared for numerous trips. The Coffee, which we both wanted, came in a stainless steel thermos which could only hold less than four cups of Coffee in total. If you want more... just ask for another thermos.  Externally provided Pastries such as Donuts, Maple Bars and such were dry, very dry... as though they had been sitting for quite awhile. I don't know when the Feast Buffet opens, but I guess 8:30am is not early enough for these items.   At the end of the meal... it was interesting to do some \"people-watching\". The majority of people looked like they had a hard night of gambling... with a \"Not another Buffet!!\"-look on their face. The only people that looked like they were even remotely enthusiastic were kids running around the Buffet. Still... a lot of waste by people at neighboring tables - unfortunately. As for me... my plate was clean!   As we were leaving, after our meal, I could see why Bill recommended that we get here before 8:30am... the general Buffet line snaked close to the entrance of the Casino itself!    There sure are a LOT of \"Feast Buffets\" in Las Vegas here at Red Rock & Green Valley Ranch AND at the Station Casinos. Have some Casinos out-sourced their Buffet service to a separate entity that only specializes in Buffets? Seems like it...   Bill thought the Breakfast was also Average, at best. But, at Five Bucks (with Player's Club Card), you can't find a better bargain anywhere else. If I had to pay full price... I'd Seriously think of looking somewhere else..."}
{"text":"Mothers Day Brunch was an absolute disaster that can only be attributed to a totally unprepared management team at The Feast at Green Valley Ranch.  After waiting 1.5 hours to be seated--which was somewhat expected as it was Mothers Day-- they placed us at a table in the corner near the clearing section. Relieved to be finally seated at ANY table we tried to navigate through the mindless buffet set up which didn't even add a carving station thus causing a further 10 minute wait for hot food. Similarly, they placed the breakfast food NEXT TO the carving station which caused another delay and bottleneck. I guess it was beyond their cognitive ability to imagine that you might need TWO carving stations on a day where you were serving 5x as many customers. Oh well...  When I finally did make it back with my kids food, I noticed our table had a stench of garbage as they couldn't keep up with the flow of half-eaten plates, so much of this food ended up on the floor near the entrance to the busing station. Nice....  At this point, our Mothers Day brunch was totally ruined so we spoke with the Waitress--who was actually doing a nice job-- who brought the GM (or Restaurant Manager over). He seemed completely disinterested in any of our feedback (didn't even apologize) so I escalated it to another Manager, who also saw no need to offer us a simple discount even comp one of our 5 meals out-- and only begrudgingly apologized.   BOTTOM LINE: UNTIL GVR GETS SERIOUS ABOUT HIRING QUALIFIED F&B MANAGERS AVOID THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"went here for dinner a couple of weeks ago.  Red Rock buffet is definitely one of the better dinner buffets I have been to in Las Vegas.  98% of the items I tried were hot...not just warm or luke warm which is a major pet peeve of mine when going to a buffet.   Be prepared because the line to get in on a Tuesday was pretty long.  The carving station had turkey, lamb I believe, prime rib and maybe something else.  All of the side dishes and vegetables were pretty good.  The au gratin potatoes though.............OH MY!!!  So delish! And last but not least, the deserts.  WOW WOW WOW.  I felt like such a piglet.  And the frozen custard was to die for.  And the lil red velvet cupcakes....nom nom nom! Would definitely recommend RR Feast Buffet!"}
{"text":"we come here for breakfast once a month because I always get a coupon in the mail for 2 for 1 50% off.... Love the omelet station.  The bacon could definitely be more crispy and the lil mini waffles that I love are always luke warm but my fix to that is pop them in the toaster and they are good as new!!! We've come once or twice for dinner which I was not a fan of at all but for the price, you can't beat it for a decent meal!"}
{"text":"I must say I was happily surprised with brunch here. I thought oh no the price (being in Vegas) here is so cheap so that must mean the food is not good quality. But OH MY it was super clean and food was delicious and the server was on point with everything. We are a group of 8 and we are so happy with this place.  Going there tonight for dinner let's see how that works out for us."}
{"text":"It was a long wait to get in but once in the server came over pretty quick to take our drink order and off we went to the line.  One thing I noticed that I liked right away was the fact that they now have antibacterial stations for your to clean your hands before moving on.  Unfortunately there are a LOT of people who wait in line outside to get in and touch everything there is to touch and then go straight for the plates without thinking about sterilizing their hands from everything they touched before they came in and then they touch all the tongs which sometimes that part of the handle touches the food and oh well.  It comes with the risk of coming to a buffet.  This buffet was ok, being Veterans day, we only had to pay $10.80 so it was worth the price of admission.    This does not seem to be an overly priced buffet and the selection is good.  We saw some items like baked chicken as well as fried, so you did have a choice between bad and really bad.  Why bad, because I am sure that nothing there was organic, so you were taking another risk once you get past the germs people put on the serving spoons because not everyone thinks to disinfect their hands from everything they touched while waiting in line.  Overall it was good and worth the price."}
{"text":"I came here with my family it's always good to go to a buffet in groups. Prices are very reasonable. The waitress or waiter actually gets your drinks for you. All you have to do is load up your plate. Many of selections from American food, Italian, Mexican, and Asian food. Also lots of desserts, soups , and salads. I had a good experience here. And I am FULL."}
{"text":"The buffet service was good. However, the food quality was horrible and dry. Btw this was the dinner buffet. Save your money and go to Fiesta Rancho down the road."}
{"text":"This place definitely deserves a solid 4/5. I'd heard that this Feast Buffet is different and better than all the others. Based on my experience, this is absolutely true. I would put this in second place when it comes to buffets that aren't on The Strip (Studio B and Carnival tie for first in my book). This place has a wider selection and better quality than the other Feast Buffets (also better than Alliante).   We went for dinner on MLK around 5:30p and there was quite a line (I hear there always is). It probably took 45 minutes to get a table and another 18 minutes before the waitress took our drink orders.   But on to the important part - the food!  Pork Curry - I certainly haven't seen this before offered at any other casino, not even on The Strip. Not only was it unique, it was also delicious! It was a red sauce, huge chunks of pineapple, had a little spice, but not too much, huge fresh basil leaves and very tender pork. The lo mein noodles were near by and I opted to put those at the bottom of my bowl for fun. Delicious combo!   Fried Chicken - This was actually the best fried chicken I've had here in Vegas (and that includes Yard Bird). It had the perfect amount of crunch, tender and juicy inside and so much flavor!   Tempura Sushi - Ok. Not every buffet offers sushi. So to  see tempura was super exciting! This is another item I haven't seen at any other Vegas buffet. And interestingly enough, they don't offer just one kind - they had a mix of maybe three different rolls! It was delicious with either the soy sauce or the sweet and sour sauce.   Egg Rolls - Pretty decent! Definitely better than a lot of others I've had at buffets.   Pizza - They seemed to offer a nice variety. Not just red sauce, but also one with a tasty white sauce and broccoli!  Taco Station - Props for having a taco station. But obviously nothing compared Bacchanal. I will say that while the carnitas weren't as tender as I would expect, they did have great flavor. The couple other Mexican offerings I tried were only so-so.   Wedge Salad - This reminded me of Wicked Spoon! I have to say it was just as nicely done!  Spumoni Gelato - I've actually never tried this flavor before. For those of you who don't now, its cherry and pistachio ice cream with swirls of chocolate sauce. And this place offers a great version! It was soft and began melting immediately - just the way I like it. The cherry flavor was particularly nice. I recommend topping it with hot fudge and mini '&M's at the topping station. OR, take it a step further - grab a toffee cake, cover it with caramel and then put that scoop of gelato on top. So good!!!  Creme Brûlée - Not the best, before t certainly not the worst. Very enjoyable! I was sad that when I went back up for more it was all gone.   S'More Shooter - There is a layer of crumbled Graham cracker on the bottom, a thin layer of chocolate ganache, a thick layer of what tasted like a buttercream icing, a layer of mini marshmallows and then a drizzle of chocolate. Pretty tasty! My only complaint is that I would've preferred a thicker layer of ganache.   Carrot Cake - I truly appreciated that this had just as much icing as it did cake. Seriously, it was a 50/50 ration. This is how all cakes should be.   This is only a short list of compared to all they had available! So many choices!  My only complaints of the evening -   1. Our waitress taking 18 minutes to stop by for a drink order. We saw her pass by several times and completely ignored us trying to wave her down.   2. No spoons at the dessert station. I had to walk to the other end of the buffet to find some by the Asian soups. Life is pretty hard. Lol"}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. The service was good, even if we did have to listen to them arguing amongst themselves. The selection seems only slightly smaller that Sunset Station, but maybe that's my imagination. It was a calm lunch and not very crowded."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had to take mom to their great breakfast buffet because our last effort had failed (Main St. had a pretty pathetic selection). But this was great, especially considering the great price! There are fun things like breakfast pizza, omelette stations and even the soft-serve machine is on for breakfast. My favorite was the Rosemary potatoes and the Brussels sprouts. Hubby loves all the Mexican options. And I think mom liked having ice cream for dessert!  Since we live nearby, this will definitely be a regular go-to for us!"}
{"text":"Have to say this is probably one of my favorite buffets in town. Definitely in my top 5! The food is always fresh and lots to choose from. Love the milkshakes and gyro station. One thing they could improve is the deserts.  Price is very reasonable at whatever time you go!  Oh this buffet is at Green Valley Ranch"}
{"text":"Feast Buffet is supposed to be one of the top lower end Vegas buffets.  Located in Palace Station. Usually never busy or packed.  Small buffet compared to what you see on the strip.   Food selection was typical, do not expect anything fancy or high quality. Dessert selection was the same, tasted like store bought stuff.   Fills you up for the decent price but do not expect to be blown away."}
{"text":"I really like the Red Rock Resort.  My friends and I stayed there so that we could do some mtn biking and watch the ncaa tournament in the sports book.  The resort is nice, clean, and not too crowded.  After staying on the strip the last couple of times, this spot is much more convenient.  I'd probably still stay on the strip if I was with my wife though, since there are no shows or fancy restaurants at the Red Rock.  That being said, I was really disappointed with the Feast Buffet.  It was about $22 which is not expensive, but I was really disappointed in the quality of the food.  I ate a little of everything, and nothing was particularly good.  Sushi was worse than what I can get at my local Ralphs.  The BBQ ribs were dry.  Hardly any fish to chose from.  Asian section was about as good as panda express.  Really, nothing great about it.  I was more excited about the Fat Burger that I got in the casino food court.  Come to think of it, I also got a great prosciutto sandwich in the casino too.  Next time, I will try the bbq place instead.    BTW, if you are staying at the Red Rock.  There's a great Whole Foods down the street that has a lot of prepared food.  You can pick up really good stuff there and bring it back.  Also, across the street was an Italian pizza/deli that was good too."}
{"text":"This is not the best buffet in Vegas, but it's certainly the best value. Had dinner here last night, and then breakfast this morning.   Noteworthy last night was the salmon... Really good! There was also roast beef, ham, and all the usual buffet staples.   Based on dinner, I'd have gone five stars, but breakfast was a bit disappointing, primarily because of the actions of their \"egg nazi\".   We arrived 45 minutes before the switch from breakfast to lunch, but had to wait 40 minutes on line to get in. I got a plate and went to the 'eggs to order' station, where the cook was doing a couple of omelets. As I got ready to order, though, I was stopped by a guy in a black uniform marked \" Assistant Room Chef\", who told me \"Omelette station is closed at 11\". I looked at my phone. 11:02. I told him we'd been waiting 45 minutes, pointed out the cook was still doing eggs and I only wanted a fried egg. No budging him. \" No eggs for you!\"  The only eggs on the breakfast station were old and dried up scrambled eggs, so it was an eggless breakfast. There was also no bacon left, and very little other breakfast food.   I understand they have a changeover time, but if they are still selling breakfast at 11 there should still be breakfast food available at 11.  Richard"}
{"text":"When they have two-for-one deals you go to the kiosk and then never has the deal is showing up under the promotions so we have to go to the reward center every time in order to get the deal which takes a lot of time standing"}
{"text":"Went to the Buffett today and it was way overpriced for the service and the way that employees deal with customers. There were way over a hundred people in the regular guest line and the hostesses were more worried about the Black Players Club Card members. I watched the hostess seat six tables of the Black players Club Card members to one of the rest of us. When I complained she proceeded to argue and not care. The waiter was lousy and I was done with my first plate of food before he even took our drink order and when he brought them he slammed them down.   The prime rib was extreamly fatty and the ribs were all fat. None of the deserts were made in house and I even watched them unload store bought donuts on the trays. Also the ice cream was not at a cold enough tempature and the toppings were lousy.   I think the Mainstreet Station would have been a better place to eat."}
{"text":"I have only been to the. breakfast buffet but loved it. The price was better than reasonable. The food was good especially the omelet station, awesome. My son loves coming here. After brunch we usually catch a movie at the cinema located in the Casino. I love all of the Station Casinos. Their is something for everybody."}
{"text":"TIME SPENT 2 Dinnertime meals  LAYOUT spacious, comfy seating, good selection of foods.  SERVICE/FOOD i thought the quality of service and food are both good.   i REALLY liked it when Sante Fe Feast Buffet gave it's customers the option of having their Snow Crab Legs flavored with a cajun-like sauce upon request.   i'm not sure if they still offer that as Aliante Feast Buffet stopped offering Snow Crab and i think Santa Fe Feast Buffet may have also.???  NOTE* Santa Fe/Feast Buffet -- also gives it's military members a free meal on Veterans Day.   thanks.^^  PRICING average cost...  think $25.??  CLOSING i had a blast on my Veterans Day meal.   yeah, the meal was free for me, but it didn't stop me from going back a week later with friends for a paid meal.^^"}

NOTE* Aliante/Feast Buffet -- loves it's military members on Veterans Day as the meal is free.^^  PRICING average cost...  think $25.??  CLOSING Aliante does a good job of balancing price and selection.   -1 Star until you reinstate Snow Crab Legs.^^;"}
{"text":"I have frequented several buffets in town (Aliante, MGM Grand, and now Feast Buffet at Red Rock, and while it is not the worst, it is not the best either.  The food selection is quite vast, but you pay for it.  With the complimentary players club card you do save a few bucks, but make sure to bring your ID to get your club card.  A couple of the highlights from the selection are the spring rolls, the prime rib, and the pork green curry.  Was a little disappointed with the seafood selection, not having king crab legs and all.  I figure if you're going to compete with the likes of the strip or M Casino, I would assume your seafood selection would be top notch.  Either way, it's in a great location near downtown Summerlin and the service was frequent and efficient."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch was over priced for the food the quality was really lacking. I really expected more. But it was clean and the food was not horrible. The servers were just rude and the food was blah and way over priced."}
{"text":"This place is nasty. Nothing seems appetizing and I came in hungry and honestly mc donalds even tastes better than this place. Not worth the $32.41 I paid for 2 people I only ate 1 plate and didnt even finish it and neither did my cousin. I don't like giving bad reviews but for the money jusy skip this place."}
{"text":"I don't really like to eat at buffets. Not really a big fan of cafeteria style food. That being said, I don't mind having lunch at Feast buffet once in a while. It is clean and they have pretty good salad bar. I usually just eat the roasted chicken and salad if I go here, so I can't speak on the rest of the selections."}
{"text":"Brunch Buffet was less than ok.  All the food tastes like it looks OLD!!!  Server was really nice and helpfull.  Wish they spent as much time on the food as they did the help."}
{"text":"Wow.....extremely rude staff! . It was a little full today, we waited for about 40 mins,no problem. As we were walking up to the cashier my mother stopped (were a group of eleven). She was just checking if everyone had their membership cards out, the cashier with glasses( didn't catch her name! Sadly) told the other cashier \" I hate it when they just stand there ugh\" and tried to get the people behind us before we walked up. Lots of upset faces from the staff anywhere you look.. some are nice but not most. The food is normal. Doesn't seem like most of them are happy to be working there."}
{"text":"The buffet at Aliante casino is just average.  Almost everything was fresh but just average in taste and preparation.    The ribs were boiled, not grilled, but tasted okay.  The carved beef was decent, moist and cooked well.  The fried chicken was okay but the batter was kind of bland.  The spaghetti tasted like it had been sitting around a while, and the marinara sauce was just warmed-up tomato sauce.  The scalloped potatoes were actually pretty good, and I came back for a second helping.  They also had some really good ice cream in the dessert section.  I don't think I'd make a special trip to come back to this buffet.  The price was reasonable for a dinner buffet ($12.95), but there are better food choices in Las Vegas and definitely better buffets."}
{"text":"When you go to a buffet you should not be expecting to eat gourmet top quality food. With that being said, Green Valleys buffet was better then expected. Out of the 10+ things i tried i maybe said I don't care for that about 2 things? 1 being the Mac&Cheese which i'm surprised at because that is such an easy item!  For the price, the item selection, and the location overall really great."}
{"text":"I would say average at best. Price is reasonable. Good selection. A little more pride could be taken in food preparation as some items seemed \"slopped\" out. Seating took very long. Waiter was very nice and came around often."}
{"text":"Another day, another buffet. Solid place for bulking on a budget. A lot of protein for ~$12. Overall your standard buffet. The carving station typically has roast beef or brisket. The Mediterranean salad is on point. Things are constantly rotated so you don't have to worry about items sitting out for long period of time. Dessert bar is lacking but what do you expect for the price. Service is great. Will be back on bulking days."}
{"text":"What can I say? It's a buffet.  Disclaimer: I have never paid to eat here. I don't even know how much it costs. My Uncle has Presidential-level points. For some reason, our family likes to come here every now and then and feast courtesy of his comps (though we hadn't been for a few years until last weekend).  I do appreciate the Pasta Station. You tell the guy what to make and he cooks it. It's a good option because you know the food hasn't been sitting there for a long time. It's not unique by any stretch, but I pretty much always get a plate here on every visit.  As for the rest of the buffet, it's pretty standard. Nothing amazing. Well, I did enjoy the fried catfish. Yum."}
{"text":"Very similar to the Feast Buffets at other recent Station Casino properties.  The food was satisfactory.  We went on a Saturday night, so it was steak and shrimp night.  I did not see very many shrimp dishes.  The sirloin and NY steaks were decent.  Overall, a decent buffet, but for the same price, I'd much rather go to the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort."}
{"text":"This is a fairly standard Station Casinos \"Feast\" buffet. The food quality seems to be just a notch higher than I've experienced at other places, including Red Rock and Aliante. What makes me a fan are the whole bulbs of roasted garlic (YUM) and the fact that they had menudo! Who knows if it was canned menudo or made in the kitchen. It's just one of those little random discoveries that made the dining experience ever-so-slightly better."}
{"text":"$12.99 Saturday night with a brand new players card. Not great on price. Food was alright, pizza wasn't great. Waitress was good and kept my drink full."}
{"text":"This place used to be a good buffet place for the money.  Went there in September for their Friday evening seafood buffet for $25.  The only thing they added for the seafood buffet that wasn't on their regular buffet menu was Alaska crab legs.  For the money, it was way overpriced.  Everything else was fine as far as the quality of the food, but the crab legs were overcooked, and felt I could have gotten their standard buffet for a much cheaper price.  Their morning buffets are much better in value."}
{"text":"Nicole at the omelets station is the best part of the buffet she is excellent and always smiling"}
{"text":"The only thing that stops me from giving 5 stars is the fact that they were out of scrambled eggs. When I asked for some I was told u could get it from the omelet station because she makes them for the buffet.  She was to bzy making eggs for TIPS to stock the buffet!"}
{"text":"For the price with a player's card it's not bad.  It's definitely not the food quality you're going to get at some of the other buffets but you're also not paying $70 a head here.  I went on a BBQ night and the BBQ was palatable, but I actually really liked the cheese hominy they had out as a side.  For the money it's a good deal, especially if you're hungry..."}
{"text":"This is the best buffet in the whole city!!!! I'd give 10 stats if possible!! The food is always fresh and delicious! They have such a good selection of food at this buffet from Mexican to Chinese to dessert!"}
{"text":"Maybe my experience at Caesar's Palace's Bacchanal Buffet conditioned me to expect the same exemplary quality from other Vegas buffets. Not a smart mindset. This was right along the average line and 'typical' is the word. My uncle took a bunch of us from our church choir to celebrate his birthday and everyone was excited for lunch. I envisioned just as much diversity here and was already itching to hoard the dessert area. When we got there, my father, the big crabs legs fan, walked from one end of the buffet counter to another in hopes of seeing his glorious, scrumptious crabs to no avail. So he settled with crispy shrimp and roast beef instead.   I tried bite-sized bits of almost everything. Some lettuce & spinach soup for appetizer. Second helping consisted of fried rice, crispy shrimp, chicken and cream, BBQ pork, broccoli and a couple of fortune cookies (just for the sake of reading a fortune). Last 2 walk backs were solely for dessert, considering how much of a sweet tooth I am. The best part of the buffet was probably the mint chocolate chip ice-cream and according to one of my friends, the coconut cream pies. They weren't exactly top-notch, but for $9.99, I'd say it was pretty worth it. Then again, there is no real division between the buffet area from the casino so you can expect some insidious cigarette smokes to seep in your eating area.   On the upside, champagne is served for free and the day ended with a nice toast to my uncle."}
{"text":"I don't really care for this buffet.  There isn't really anything special about it.  The service is slow and the food is cold and never looks fresh.  It does seem to be one of the cleaner \"local\" buffets.  I can't complain about the price either, definitely worth getting the player's card.  Everytime you use your card, they give you a little survey and you get money off your next visit."}
{"text":"$7.99 weekend brunch /w players card.  I believe the normal price is 9.99, but anyways for $10 you shouldn't expect much in vegas these days but this buffet does deliver decent food.  The usual items: bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes, etc were there and of decent quality.  The brunch items included fried chicken, some kind of Chinese beef and onions, and I don't remember - I didn't eat too much.  But I did like their selection of fruit (watermelon, cantolope, apples, oranges) and some of their desserts weren't that bad.  The drinks are self-serve.  Bottom line is the place is clean and decent enough and if you're staying or gambling at Palace Station this place should suit your needs."}
{"text":"This isdefinately my favorite Buffett in The Vegas area. You cannot beat the price. Breakfast is only 4.99 if you have a Station casino card.  I like to come in late for breakfast, so I am able to enjoy the breakfast and lunch.  There is a good variety of foods, but I just LOVE the salad bar. I havent tried anything I dont like there yet."}
{"text":"I ate dinner here on 05/27/2015. The first dish I went for was sushi. Sushi's main ingredient is rice. I took and ate the uramaki they had. I had difficulty finishing it because the sushi rice was horrible. It tasted like one of those sushi from a cheap Chinese buffet and it also tasted like it just came out of the fridge. The pasta they had in the Italian section was mediocre. I'll give this place 2 stars because the desserts and roast beef were awesome. I would have given this place 3 stars if our server was a bit nicer and attentive."}
{"text":"This review will be short and to the point. The GVR Feast Buffet serves a large variety of tasty food, for practically half the price of a Strip Buffet. $17 including a tip, on a Saturday night is a bargain. I have ate here several times, and with the exception of the expected long line, I never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"3.5 stars-My favorite Feast Buffet:      The Red Rock Feast Buffet is my favorite Station Casinos Buffet. It has consistently been very good without achieving the level of outstanding. Today, when I made it my post - hike supper; it was one more positive experience.      Station Casinos might be genuine when they advertise they love locals. They sent this local a booklet with a half - off cupoun for any Feast buffet. I planned ahead to Saturday nights when Station doubles their price for the gimmicky prime rib & shrimp night. Station Casino's love for locals reduced a $17.99 dinner to less than $10. Lol, I would regain all the calories that I lost from hiking the Red Rock hills bordering Blue Diamond.     From experience, I recommend arriving to the Feast Buffet before 5:00 pm. After, the long lines seem to appear. When I arrived, the line was short. However, it seemed to move like molasses.       This Feast Buffet represents a wide assortment of food in food stations featuring sushi, Mexican, barbecue, International, Asian, American, Italian, pastries, and salad bar. If I am not mistaken, this is the only Feast Buffet to feature sushi (I have to check GVR again ). Each station offers a nice variety of food. Some examples:  Asian: Asian ribs, fried rice, Singapore noodles, wonton soup, orega chicken, stir fry, lo mein, spicy tufu, Spring rolls, etc.  Sushi: peal & eat shrimp, assorted sushi, ginger, & mussel salad.  American: Live cooking station of prime rib, chicken, and turkey. Plus meatloaf, cabbage, mash potatoes, fried chicken, etc.  Italian: pizza, meatballs, sausage, chicken pesto, etc.  Pastries: full service ice cream. Plus cheesecake, German chocolate cake, cream puffs, raspberry poulade, cookies, sugar free desserts, etc.     In recent times my buffet station of choice is Asian foods. However, when sushi is offered it is my station of choice. I filled up on assorted sushi which appeared to be varieties of California rolls. My complaint is that they don't name many of the items. It was good at the same time that it wasn't close to the excellence of Yummy Sushi. Sushi and Asian foods represented my plates. I filled up on stir fry, wonton soup, and this no name soup that is below in a picture. The wonton soup was good, and I appreciated that they never ran out like they do at Sunset Station; yet it fell short of the great wonton soup that Cravings and Carnival World Buffet have served me. To conclude my meal, I drank coffee with raspberry poulade.     This very Feast Buffet is my favorite of them. The deal is that this meal is usually $20 after tax. They use the prime rib & shrimp gimmick to increase the price on a night that many people go out to eat. From experience nearly every buffet includes prime rib. When I think shrimp night, my mind has visions of broiled shrimp, stuffed shrimp, shrimp cocktails, shrimp scampi, and pealed shrimp. The only shrimp I laid eyes on here was the peal & eat shrimp. This is ordinary buffet food that I recently had during lunch in the Gold Coast Buffet. The upshot is that this gimmick is prevents me from rating it 4 stars. In conclusion, this is my favorite Feast Buffet."}
{"text":"Outstanding Value:    I applaud Station Casinos for charging reasonable prices for delicious food. Palace Station is the exception.   On a Saturday night, I waited on line for a couple of minutes, paid a little over $10 for the dinner buffet, and was eating delicious food.   In my opinion the high points were the Asian foods station, shrimp scampi with pasta, and soup. The one disappointment is that there was not won ton soup.   The music, the whole era of rock and roll was enjoyable listening to. The buffet was not packed, so I did not feel rushed.   I have dined here numerous times on a Saturday night, and have left satisfied and full."}
{"text":"2.5 STARS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT $15.99 DINNER      Following hours of hiking up in the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area, I decided to make the Santa Fe Station Feast Buffet my post - hike supper. This review is testimony that I should of picked one of a hundred other restaurants for dinner. I have a frustrating relationship with Feast Buffets. Sometimes they are rewarding dinners in Boulder Station and Red Rock Resort Feast Buffets or poor experiences in this Feast Buffet for example. This is my second time here in person and the first time as a Yelper. My first experience was around 2009 before the remodel. I attempted to try it in 2012, but in the 24/7 City of Las Vegas they shut down at 9:00 on Saturday night.     There was a moderate line to pay for the buffet. Nothing like the lines I have stood on at Red Rock, Sunset, Boulder Station, or Green Valley Ranch Feast Buffets. The $15.99 plus taxes brought my Saturday night special dinner to $18 before the tip. The deal was there was nothing special about this Saturday night special that was advertised steak and seafood night. There was zero value to the meal. Unless I was missing something I failed to find a seafood station. The only seafood I saw was the live shrimp scampi at the Italian foods station. Where was the peeled shrimp? I really dislike the steak and seafood gimmick that many casino operators use to jack up the price.      In general, there was a poor selection of food. Right off the bat I could tell a good buffet from their Asian foods station. I can assert that their sister property Boulder Station has a far better Asian foods station with at least double the selection. In reality, $18 brought me a couple of bowls of wonton soup, cabbage based vegetables  (where is the description of the food?), chow mein noodles, rice, wonton soup, shrimp scampi, cola, coffee, and desert. The food lacked flavor just like the coffee. I only took a few sips of the coffee and said, \"forget this.\" Finally, the sushi that Red Rock Feast Buffet (similar price) features is nonexistent here.       A hardworking yet unfriendly woman served my two colas, cleaned the table, and served my coffee.      There are two compliments that I will bestow this Feast Buffet. First, the Halloween presentation of the pastries was neat. And second, I appreciated that the wontons are in a separate bowl from the broth. A major complaint I have in regards to their sister Feast Buffet at Sunset Station is that they frequently run out of the wontons.      Based on my experience of paying close to $20 for a gimmick steak and seafood night, I have to rate it 2.5 stars. If I return on a night when it is $9.99 and get value, I might pen a review update. In conclusion, Station Casinos is their own biggest problem. A few miles south on the 215, their Red Rock Feast Buffet offers far more at a similar price. Most likely I will return to the Red Rock Feast Buffet before I return to the Santa Fe location. In conclusion, Santa Fe Station Feast Buffet can feast on 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"SIMPLY NOT THE BEST      Yesterday was about my third time catching the Feast Buffet at Texas Station's act. In Feast Buffet style the quality of the food could be good one visit and behind the eight ball on others. On yesterday's visit color me unimpressed with the quality of the food.    I arrived on the cue for Feast Buffet around 3:15 pm. It was a fairly long line that moved on the slow side because not all stations were available. The upside to the line management is that when I approached the front there was a register on both sides. If you've been to the Feast Buffet at Red Rock or Green Valley Ranch, you have to get off the line to pay then get back in line while being assertive about preventing people from the VIP lines cutting into your side. This line management technique raised my rating from 2 8/10 stars to 3. The thing is that the buffet wasn't really worth the wait.     The admission for a buffet adventure on Sunday is around $10.50 for all day brunch. In my honest opinion the brunch buffet is a gimmick to raise the price of lunch just like Red Rock adding some peeled shrimp to their Saturday buffet and calling it the shrimp and rib night to raise the price. Personally at 3:15 pm in the afternoon, I don't want an American food station for example to have zero corn niblets in place of scrambled eggs.    Both the selection and taste were bland. The Asian foods station was lacking on chow fun, spicy eggplant, and cabbage for example. The Italian food station was mostly spaghetti, meatballs, and filler food. And contrary to the majority of the Feast Buffets an ice cream station was nonexistent. The food was so forgettable. For example, the rib was mostly a sticky bone. The temperature of the coffee was below my expectations. My favorite part of the meal was the wonton soup. I did not have the usual experience that I have at the Sunset Station Buffet where the bowl of wonton soup is all broth and carrots.    What about the service? Just like the majority of Feast Buffets there is one overworked server balancing several tables worth of dishes. I did find it discusting looking at all the used plates at the vacated table to my left for a good half hour.     Feast Buffet at Texas Station is simply not the best. I know that they will never be the best. But they could be a lot better than they were today."}
{"text":"Formerly Aliante Station's Feast Buffet:  I rate Medley Buffet okay with a capital O. Recently Station Casinos sold off Aliante Station. After the change in ownership the Feast Buffet exited the newly named Aliante, and Medley Buffet came in. In a way this is a change for the better. I was not crazy over Aliante Station's Feast Buffet. It was on a level below the majority of Station's Feast Buffets. The fact that I was left to fill up on corn chips on my last brunch there, would of left me with a 2-star rating.     The reality is I am also not crazy over Medley Buffet.  It is still a star up from the former Feast Buffet.  Everything that I put on my plate: won ton soup, spaghetti with meatballs, chow mien noodles, fried rice, and cocktail shrimp at night was just Okay.    What is good about Medley Buffet is the price, limited wait, and service. What they did right was to check up on refills and clear the tables-with a smile.    Medley Buffet is in a league far above Circus-Circus Buffet and far below Rio's Carnival Buffet. It is in a league worthy of a return visit when I am in The Aliante."}
{"text":"The Feast Buffet at Sunset Station is unpredictable. Prior to the New Year, I rated it 4 stars. Their Asian food station including wonton soup alone was a VALUE. Then they decided to replace 3/4 of the Asian food buffet with a Mongolian barbecue station. The problem with the Mongolian barbecue has been a poor presentation with dollar bills spread on the counter where you put your plate. From my observation, it is far less popular than the Asian food station. And in my opinion it looks like filler.       On my last visit I was a hair from giving Feast Buffet 1 star. Owing to the fact that I never gave it 4 stars all the times I went there when it was great, it was the right thing to give it one more try before my review. On the previous visit, the food selection was so poor that I resorted to strictly wonton soup. Guess what? There are no wontons when I keep return to the station. By the way the stations were also filthy. So  I did what I am prone to do when a buffet is a total adomination: resort to filling up on nacho chips. When I tasted stale nacho chips, I tipped the server, and walked out.     Fast forward to today, and I'd give Feast Buffet at Sunset Station  4 stars. At $10 and change, it was very reasonable for a Sunday. The Mongolian Buffet was replaced with 100% of their commendable Asian Buffet. A different person was manning the central station, and there was wonton soup with wontons. I did not have to resort to eating nacho chips.    The Feast Buffet has been unpredictable. Evening out all my visits, I leave my Feast Buffet at Sunset Station at 3 stars"}
{"text":"Really gone down hill, not impressed with the food. The service was great but not a good buffet."}
{"text":"Horrible food, cold even the fresh pans that came out food still cold. The only thing good was our server. Also over priced.!!"}
{"text":"Only $5 for breakfast and $7 for lunch but we were cheap and showed up at 10:30, ate a plate of breakfast while waiting for them to change over at 11 to lunch.  I don't eat breakfast foods but they had salami and pepperjack cheese cubes which I snacked on while waiting for them to uncover the lunch.   It's really close to the Nellis Air Force Base which we stay at whenever we got to vegas so we went twice. Make sure you get the boarding pass so you get the discount and $10 free play cash!"}
{"text":"Out of all the buffets I've been to in Las Vegas this is just average. My mom and I went to eat there for lunch because she had gone here for breakfast the week before and loved it. There's a lot to pick from and I didn't try everything so if you're hungry and want to eat go for it. But if you're going as a tourist or taking your family and friends out to eat and show off Las Vegas, don't go here. There are waaaaaay better buffets out there than this.   Here are some dishes that I downright just didn't like: Noodles Ribs Pork Potato Balls Some of the rice pizza (yep even this)"}
{"text":"We cam to this hotel because we have been going to vegas for 15 years and just curious what it has to offer away from the strip. We stumbled at their buffet and we signed up for the membership and got the lunch for 10.99 per adult and 9.99 for kids. Food was ok just to feed the hunger. For the price, cant complain."}
{"text":"Feast at Red Rock is better than any of the other Station buffets. The foods are a bit fresher and the staff is generally about the same average servers. We enjoyed the carving station and Asian cuisine the most.  Overall, you get what you pay for in a buffet in Las Vegas. This is a mid scale and decent option when you want a variety of offerings."}
{"text":"There always seems to be a line at this buffet, so I take that as a good sign!   The food is organized very well with signs up top. The salads and breads, the pre-course foods, are located somewhere in the middle. I normally never get mac salad anywhere, but I decided to try it and it was surprisingly good. Forgive me but I don't really remember the names of any of the food I got besides the obvious salmon & mashed potatoes & such. The dessert bar isn't as good as places like bacchanal or the M, but it's decent.   I've been to a lot of buffets in town and I wouldn't put this one in my top 3, but they're not bad at all. This is located outside of the strip so it's really convenient! Nobody wants to deal with all that traffic."}
{"text":"Really good food and lots of choices. get the players card and u will get a big discount."}
{"text":"When I moved to Vegas the Feast Buffet at Boulder Station was my very first Vegas casino buffet. While it was my first, it's not my current favorite as there are other contenders for that crown, but they also come with a much higher price tag. But when you want a solid buffet with Asian, Italian, and other ethnic options and live action stations from meat carving to Asian prep...you can't go wrong by coming here.   My last visit was for Thanksgiving as it was a reminder of how far we had come since moving here. While this year this food was not quite as good, \"they didn't have pumpkin raviolis this time\", the turkey and ham was perfect, the prime rib vanished, and their banana creme pie was really good.   One thing I really dislike is they charged FULL PRICE for a soon to be 3 year old. Seriously, $15 for Thanksgiving for a 2 year old, and we got some attitude from the cashiers to boot? No, I don't think so. I'm going to squawk about that. And rather than talk to a powerless manager, let me use my trusty Yelp bullhorn to say I think the pricing for kids sucks.   I would give 4 Stars, but the outright fleecing over the kids pricing rips one star completely out of consideration."}
{"text":"As long as you don't try and go on a holiday (the line is atrocious) this is actually one of the better buffets for locals in Vegas. The place is clean, the wait staff is understaffed but they have heart, and the food is definitely a cut above usual Station Casinos buffet fare. (Green Valley Ranch is better but not by much). When I have visitors come in to Vegas this is the first buffet I take them to. In short every buffet has shortcomings but this is one that has never left me disappointed or thinking I won't come back."}
{"text":"Soooo wonderful for the price!!! I was pleasantly surprised at the huge array of vegetarian options!!! Everything was tasty too. Had a small stomach ache after but nothing too bad. Will be back"}
{"text":"If you're coming here for dinner you need to get there 30 minutes beforehand. There's a lot of people that comes so there's a long line and they do charge extra for holidays other than that the restaurant is cheap. There food on the trays of the best fit are cold. I got a ravioli and the chicken I marinated chicken in it was cold when I got to my table it did taste good though. I do recommend if you go make sure the chef makes you something fresh his cooking is really good on the spot. The desserts was the same as any other buffet  .  They had  little  pastries  it was a cannoli . It was really good ."}
{"text":"I have pretty much given up dinner buffets, never much cottoned to luncheon buffets and am now on the cusp of going buffetless on my trips to Las Vegas.  The only thing holding me back is they tend to be either ridiculously inexpensive or free and I am ridiculously cheap, or as I prefer, frugal.  This morning I managed to stuff myself with OJ, fresh melon, ambrosia, ham, Brussel sprouts, easy over eggs and my 2 Las Vegas guilty pleasures - bacon and corned beef hash.  Everything was satisfactory without anything standing out."}
{"text":"I had a MyVegas reward for 2 free lunch or breakfast buffet so we decided to stop in for breakfast before continuing on to Red Rock Canyon.  I began with an assortment of fresh melon, strawberry yogurt and OJ.  My second plate was limited to a Mexican tart topped taco meat and salsa on an inedible base.  I fared better with plate #3 by ordering a thin spinach omelet, though the chef forgot the requested cheese, plus a dollop of corned beef hash and breakfast potatoes.  Plate #4 consisted of a small taste of 2 salads, watermelon/tomato and a very blah, jicama.  Overall I found the room out shined the pedestrian food."}
{"text":"The room is spacious and reminiscent of the one at Red Rock.  The overall food quality was good, but the variety was disappointing because the ethnic stations were closed as was the dessert section. I settled on a rather mundane breakfast of cooked-to-my specifications (thin) omelet, OJ, fruit, bacon and more fruit."}
{"text":"This breakfast buffet, a former favorite, seems to have gone downhill over the past few years and one senses the employees are going through the motions.  Other than unripe melon and bananas, there was only canned fruit available, several dishes had not turned over since being prepared earlier in the morning, and there was no bacon, oh the horrors, on my first two passes.  I settled on the unripe fruit, ambrosia, easy over eggs, Brussel sprouts, ham and, after waiting patiently, several strips of bacon.  Fortunately, it was free courtesy of a MyVegas reward."}
{"text":"Oh my god. So. Much. Food. And for $12?! Crazy! I wanted to give it five stars so bad but....it's so confusing to navigate. People don't know how to line up. You go to grab a plate but then you have to sit and it's not really explicitly said when you can get up to go. Lines go in both directions and no one knows where to start. The pastries are good, the biscuits are to die for. Pancakes were cold which was a little disappointing but the omelette station cooked to order. They also had ice cream and pizza and polenta cakes. Crazy variety so definitely worth going off strip."}
{"text":"20 minutes off the strip.  Line wasn't too long. Nice, clean, classy casino.   Came here with the intent of being a crab leg glutton. Turns out that they don't serve  crab legs in the month of December. =,(  But who's to complain when a buffet costs 11.99 for the month of December? They still have the standard Vegas buffet foods... prime rib, chinese, mexican, and a pretty decent dessert bar."}
{"text":"I don't do buffets. Something about food sitting on a counter as countless people walk by and touch and poke at it just grosses me out. But my husband wanted to eat here for breakfast and so we did. And you know what? I liked it.  We didn't use a player's card when we paid and the two of us came to $17.00. There were a lot people eating but the line was short. We got in line at 9 am. I got a bagel and eggs and bacon and hashbrowns. And then the waitress forced me to eat a chocolate donut.  The food was good and it was fresh too. I guess when the buffet is so busy they are constantly preparing new food so nothing is out too long. When we were leaving the restaurant the line was insane, no way I would have waited in it if it was like that when we got there."}
{"text":"It's a buffet. We all know what that means and what it normally entails. And this isn't one of your fancy buffets on The Strip with marble floors and carefully-crafted dishes. The price is ridiculously cheap and the food can be decent. I've only been here for breakfast and with my parents (since they like it and have lots of comps). Their omelette station is wonderful since you can get something fresh and to your liking (I also like all their fresh vegetable selections). The bacon, Potatoes O'Brien, and corn beef hash tend to be good as well. Nothing is stellar nor consistent in taste, so currently not my choice of dining. It is perfect for a quick, casual, inexpensive meal for a group without having to decide what everyone wants to eat. Service is usually really good."}
{"text":"Not my favorite buffet, but definately a good value.  Good selection, a little bland, but still tasty.  And very convenient."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best. Sometimes food isn't even warm or correct temperature. Quality of food is very inconsistent, as is their chef's abilities to prepare it correctly. You have at most, a 50/50 shot of enjoying a dish there.   Also, wasted our time coming here by looking at their website hours which said they had lunch till 4pm, but they were closed when I got there and preparing for dinner. Dinner is definitely not worth the price. I'd rather go to a sit down restaurant and pay for 1 good dish than an all you can eat's worth of subpar food."}
{"text":"This buffet has a wide range of all kinds of delicious food. You can't beat the price. If you are a fan of menudo then this buffet has the best in town. Chunks of tripe loaded with flavor, add lemon onions you can go wrong. I come 3 times a week."}
{"text":"Despite the very sketchy clientele and Denny's vibe the food was decent especially for the low price ($7.99). Highlights - great salad bar, turkey/ham/prime rib carving station, and some authentic-for-a-buffet mexican items (sopes, onion/cilantro, charro beans, tomatillo/verde sauce dish) that were very good. I would never recommend this buffet but if you are at the casino it's worth a try since it's nice on the wallet/purse - just watch your wallet/purse while you're there because the clientele looks 'prison'."}
{"text":"Decent buffet at a reasonable price - not something I would recommend driving to but if you're in the area definitely go!   Nice salad bar, good breads, fresh fruit, sushi. I did not try many of the hot food options but I really liked their pizzas (2-3 different types), tofu with brown sauce (Asian), and Mexican options (chips, salsas - Pico de Gallo and tomatillo, onion/cilantro mix, etc.). Desserts were good - can request pie/cake slices, great gelato, and ice cream with candy toppings.  Clean restaurant and friendly servers. Long waits on the weekends."}
{"text":"This is a follow up to my previous review a few days ago. Today we returned to the buffet and surprisingly, they have better food today - and taste better too. We used a 2 for 1 coupon and the place was not busy at all. We came before their dinner so we get to try their lunch and their dinner menu like beef roast and their pasta cooking station which are only available during dinner. Overall it was better than few days ago."}
{"text":"One of our fav places when we don't feel like cooking! Never a long line, food is good and changes frequently! The service is always fast and friendly!"}
{"text":"I went to the movies downstairs and decided to make a trip to the buffet for dinner as I had a two for one coupon which was mailed to me.   It was Sunday night around 630pm. Line moved slowly and ended up taking about 30 mins to make it in.   To be fair, I should mention that I am a vegetarian before I continue.   The salad bar was a disappointment. The leafy greens looked brown. There wasn't a huge selection. I expected so much more in both quality and selection.   I pretty much had a small serving of everything vegetarian. Most of what I tried was disappointing. The bok choy was over cooked and slimy. The spanish rice was bland and dry. The egg rolls were definitely frozen. The pizzas didn't even look appetizing. The egg drop soup lacked flavor. I could continue on and on...  Let's skip to the few things I did enjoy. The tofu stir fry was actually really good. Full of flavor, the tofu had good texture. The bread pudding for dessert was actually really good as well. I topped the bread pudding with the vanilla sauce and it was awesome.   Service was good once we were seated. Our drink order was taken promptly and we never ran out. I even got coffee to enjoy with my dessert.   I left with that \"meh\" feeling.   I can definitely say that I wouldn't return. Just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"From all the station casinos this is by far the best buffet from the entire chain. Great selection of international flavors and desserts, better atmosphere, and cleaner facilities. Priced a little bit more than the other station casinos, but is certainly worth it!"}
{"text":"Had a great time here last Sat (12/13). The food was really surprisingly good and, holy moly, they have everything. Our server, Giselle, was especially nice -- polite and efficient and fun. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't know how the food is. Been here three times and each time there were massive lines while inside there were 50-75 empty tables and even more that were waiting to be cleaned. Management needs to stand out front and watch party after party see the line and walk out. Like most buffets the cashiers are fast but the seating takes forever while tables sit empty and customers leave."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to do lunch and dinner here. I don't think you can go anywhere and beat the prices $7.99 and $9.99! I consider Aliante and GVR the best Feast Buffets in the Valley. The food is not bland. The roast beef is off the hook! The mash potatoes have pepper corns and they taste like butter unlike harden flour lumps I've had at other Feast Buffets. The salad bar at Aliante is always full of choices and the desserts are yummy."}
{"text":"The best feast buffet of all the Stations.  Smaller selection, but what they do tastes great. Great low price. Excellent service. Would be five stars if they had spinach salad too. Its also upstairs, away from casino."}
{"text":"Erica is a really good manager. Red rock and green valley are the best feast buffets. Waitress was aweful, but Erica took care of it. EVERYTHING was delicious. All four of us were very pleased."}
{"text":"This feast buffet is just ok. Highlight, desserts.  Burgers over salted. All the Asian food had way too much msg. Salad was wilted. Waitress. Was horrible. I would give it 1 star, but the desserts were fresh and good. Not the worst station, but i don't recommend it. For free it was tge right price through My Vegas."}
{"text":"The worst of all the feast buffets. Huge selection, horrible quality. Went there many times, didn't improve."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about. Very inconsistant. Horrible service, bad attitudes. I expect that at Boulder, but Sunset? No good."}
{"text":"It's not better than the Palms. I want to give it a 4.5 but I can't so this one gets the same as the Palms which is not entirely fair. The food here is good but nothing too great. It's not bad for the price and I live close by. The place is nice and big and cheery. The food is decent. I avoid the sushi. It's just sticky rice, seaweed, and cucumber. The wonton soup is usually not bad. Kimchee is decent. The Chinese greens are good and the soups are good. The meat, meatballs, white fish are not bad either."}
{"text":"This place is better than the Fiesta next door but not by a whole lot. The place is big for the price. The food is basically cafeteria food. I think they have the ingredients but the cooks just overcook things until the bacteria are squeezed into their next 2 reincarnations."}
{"text":"Cheap but the food is very low quality. Comparable to a golden corral or hometown buffet with a bigger selection. Personally i would rank this buffet below anything on the strip but its popular with locals for obvious reasons. Bottom line if you want to eat like a slob for cheap and dont mind 3/10 quality food eat here."}
{"text":"I guess for $8, the selection is worth it. The pasta station was the best part. The cook made me a great shrimp fettuccine Alfredo.  I still would go here when I am looking for a quick buffet to go to.  They had great prices on drinks too!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. Service is horrible. Management sucks. No plates, no spoons. You ask a server and they don't know where anything is. I don't know how this place is running. The assistant manager was bussing our table and she stopped to talk and laugh with an employee twice while we stood waiting. She was so slow it was ridiculous. She should work out her body more than her mouth. Slow and fat. This used to be a favorite spot when I was younger. Never again!"}
{"text":"We got there about 10:30am. That let us have breakfast and lunch. Kind of a 'brunch' but not on a Sunday. The food was fresh and tasty. They have excellent broccoli cheese soup and fantastic stuffing. My family is the most excited about them having mint N chip ice cream with mini M&M's."}
{"text":"Wow. This place has gone severely downhill.   What ever happened to good customer service? I used to frequent this place all the time, but ever since the management shake-up that this place has had since last year, it's been complete shit.   Went there today with my boyfriend, hoping to celebrate my birthday with some nice brunch. Waited in an incredibly long queue, which was being processed by 2-3 of the slowest women I've ever seen working... The line was constantly plagued with old people and disabled people budging the line...   By the time we got up to the front, we had been in line for quite a while, I was hungry, bitchy and tired of waiting. Some guy came up the line that the elderly/disabled people had been budging in, and stood at the front there as we were going up to the counter to get rung in.   The rude woman processing transactions says to us \"I'll serve you AFTER this gentleman.\" referring to the guy who was budging in line.   I was not having any of that and said \"Look. I've been waiting in line a long time. It's my birthday, I'm hungry, I'm tired of standing, and I've been dealing with people cutting in queue the entire time. This guy is neither elderly, nor is he disabled, so he can wait his turn.\"  She checks my ID, verifies that it IS in fact my birthday, then calls over some rude, bitchy hispanic lady named Michelle.   Michelle is an assistant manager, according to her name tag, and Michelle informs me that \"President's Club\" members are more important than other people who are actually y'know... PAYING for their food... and then tells me that \"they will always take precedence over other members LIKE YOU even if it IS your birthday.\"   She then confers with the woman who got her, and says \"What are you COMPLAINING about ANYWAY?\"   I asked to speak to someone above her, as I had never been disrespected so blatantly by anyone in ANY station property, and she copped an attitude and gave me the casino general manager's name. I asked for his contact information so I could not only complain about the poor customer service of this policy that's supposedly in place, but to complain about her poor service as well and her attitude.   She wrote down his name on a blank piece of paper and shoves it at me while sticking her nose up. I said \"Excuse me? I asked you for CONTACT INFORMATION for him.\"   She wrote down the general casino number and goes \"He doesn't check IN with me.\"   Apparently good customer service has totally disappeared from this buffet since the former Feast manager Ira and former GM Sue Ascanio left. The food's also been on a steady decline, but I didn't feel like spending 50+ dollars for 2 buffets elsewhere...   Between those issues, I'm going to be taking my business elsewhere and warning people not to waste their money at the Sunset Station Feast... because your money is not as good as someone who spends a few hundred dollars a month in their casino's... even when said person is eating on a comp, and you're actually paying.   The worst part of all this? Not the fact that it was my birthday and she pulled this shit, but the fact that with the time she spent being argumentative, rude, and unprofessional? She could have processed me, the guy who was budging, and about 4 other sets of customers.   Good job with your management skills Michelle. I think you should look for employment in a McDonalds instead of an atmosphere that is supposed to be professional and courteous. Your piss poor attitude has managed to drive away a once frequent customer... god knows how many others you've run off with your ignorant mouth."}
{"text":"The lines keep getting worse and the quality of food is significantly less on lunch vs. dinner.  Ironically, dinner costs roughly 40% more.  Still good food, and a decent value with the players card."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the best station buffets in the valley. I'm not a fan of the sushi here at all, but their salads and the carving station is superb. I like the selection of Mexican food. The downside to this place is the wait. If you come here, expect to wait in line for a while. Other than that, this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"I don't go to buffets as often anymore but this place is my families go to place to get together and have brunch after church. The food is good and we have never been disappointed. The selection is always the same, some more variety would be great. The waiters are always topping off our champagne glasses so I can't complain."}
{"text":"Lines are ALWAYS so long on the weekends, and it's a pain standing in line for over an hour. If you have a player's card, you get your meals for a discounted price and sometimes they send you coupons in the meal for 2 for 1 prices which is awesome. Prices are already fairly cheap but the card makes all the difference.   Not sure about any other day, but Sunday Brunch usually comes with a complimentary mimosa/champagne if you want. That's the best part, actually. Food is okay, I mean, you get what you pay for. It's not the best buffet within the station casinos, but it's closer to where I live and a cheaper price. I feel as if they don't care about what's being served. Meaning, the consistency of the food is not always the same. Sometimes the fried chicken is good, but majority of the time it's pink on the inside which makes me lose my appetite. On the plus side, the desserts are always consistent and GREAT! Try the cheesecake.   Also forgot to mention that it takes these people forever to clean off other tables. So sometimes you're just sitting with dirty tables full of plates until someone cleans them.   Had a great server today but I can't remember his name, which made the experience better. I'm still gonna continue to come here, just wish they would do something about those wait times and the food."}
{"text":"One star for no more crab legs! Please bring it back! Then, I will change my review. Only reason why I go to Green Valley is for the yummy garlic, buttery crab legs!  Other than that, the buffet is alright. I rather stay on the strip or the M hotel buffet."}
{"text":"Best bang for your buck.  THE Food Was Good. Not the best but also not freak bad. They had all your go to type buffet food. The ice cream and Gelato were legit. Better than paying 40 to 50 bucks to eat buffet on the strip. This place had good service, and good variety.  Came here with a friend of mine after we had our morning workout. Came here for thr Gains and had a buy 1 get 1 free coupon. Would come here again.  Soon. Ciao fatties."}
{"text":"Booooo!  They drop the price of the buffet in December 2010 but also eliminated the CRAB LEGS!!!  I thought it was only temporary but I went back last night, still the same!!!  WHYYYYY?  I come here ONLY for the stir fry crab legs.  I'd rather pay more to have the CRAB LEGS!!!!  BRING THEM BACK Please!  Soooooo disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very good home-cooked type food at great prices.   Good Asian food and excellent pizza.  Amazing homemade ice cream! The only problem I have with this buffet is the food is not consistent.  Some days it's amazing other days it sucks."}
{"text":"I just got home from this buffet and im about to puke the food was burnt an they didn't clean the grill they put my beef ribs on a  plate that was covered in blood the grill had burnt scraps from previous orders it was completely disgusting and I'm sick now I'm seriously going to call health department, if they feel free to reach out to me they can message me here, this is the worst buffet I have ever been to in my entire life I can believe I spent money to eat here tomorrow I will be calling the health department.. PS IF I COULD LEAVE NEGATIVE STARS I WOULD THIS PLACE TASTE LIKE HORSE DUNG.. I will never recommend this place to anyone they should get rid of this place it is not Henderson nor the District worthy I rather eat a bowl of GMO this seriously ruined my night they will be hearing from me!!!   Me and my wife both Have diarrhea am are regurgitating everything we ate !!"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast after an early morning couponing trip at a nearby store. First off, make sure you bring your players card! I had to wait in line to get one, although the members area is located right near the buffet. Also, come early. The food was super fresh & actually really tasty.   The price: 5.99 per person for unlimited food/drink. Nice!!   Will I go back? Sure, If I am ever on that side of town around egg time!! :)   Diet friendly: Depends. My friend is a vegetarian and most items had some sort of meat in them already. They did have a fresh egg bar where they make them for you. There were not many low-cal options I noticed. Lots of egg/bread dishes... But not a ton of variety of fruit."}
{"text":"The Feast Buffet is your typical Las Vegas buffet, except this one is geared more towards us local residents.  It's nothing special, but the food is still good.  My only complaint, they charge full price for children 2 and up.  My 2 1/2 year old daughter had four bites of pizza and crackers for her \"dinner\".  Certainly not worth $15.  It would be nice if Station Casinos would add a \"kid price\" to their buffet.  I don't know any child under 5 years old who could eat $15 worth of food.  The staff is always friendly, always smiling.  Honestly, the staff is my favorite part of visiting any Stations Casino."}
{"text":"Ok so I went to lunch and notthing spectacular..it was good..tasted like the other Indian casino buffets in Cali...what i dont get is they dont have ANY SHRIMP or SEAFOOD at lunch..really cheeziee.. I dont know how i ended up here again but lemi tell you about their breakfast..the best part of my breakfast was the omellette station where they cooked my 3 eggs over easy..the bacon was good..well its freakin bacon..they had some left over rice from last nite..it was crunchy..dunno y..the breakfast piizza??..you heard right..breakfast pizza..i would guess left over again.. they had turkey??left over also..wow..so i ordered punch..it tasted like they mixed it with chalk..so I ordered ice tea..it just left me with a funny aftertaste..so i decided to just stay thirsty..they had assorted donuts..k.. this could compare to Circus Circus buffet...or...4th st in LA where they feed the homeless..."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday, food were acceptable, services were acceptable but not remarkable. Wait time was too long."}
{"text":"They don't have a big variety of food but the price is very cheap and completely worst it. Always friendly stuff. I've been here before couple times and today is not my last visit for sure."}
{"text":"Sorry but I have to bump it down a star because they have the same menu for dang near 2x the cost for dinner....I had expected SOMETHING (anything!) to be different, but nope...not at all. Just a note: The food is decent overall, after going a FEW times I can honestly say that, but no matter what, I just can't eat as much as I feel I should and at dinner prices - I almost stuffed myself on purpose! I am looking forward to trying a few new places on my next trip out that way."}
{"text":"We had lunch there today.   Honestly $7.99 for lunch? You can't beat that.  The food has improved since the last time I was there over a year ago. They still need to work on some things. The sweet potato fries were cold. The lettuce in the salad was old. If its the star of the show, use the good stuff!  The only danger of going to a buffet is eating too much, I try not to do this but damn, I end up trying a little of everything and ending up in a food coma.  The sugar free desserts are good but as always, I get tempted off the eating well trail by my nemesis,canollis, damn cannolis!  The service was very friendly.   One of the best things about this place, other than the food, is the people watching! I give it a 10, We were sat near the buffet so we got to see everyone and it was pretty damn entertaining..  Its a good price for what you get, we will be back...."}
{"text":"Food is horrible, service was very good. You get what you pay for. Old dried out food. Choices are pitiful. Seafood and fish right next to regular food could cause someone to go into allergic shock.   Wouldn't come back here if it was free!"}
{"text":"In a word - delicious! They have a wide variety of different types of cuisine. They have a fresh salad bar and several different soups. We ate there on  Monday night and everything was hot and fresh.  The fried shrimp were very tasty. In fact everything we ate had a lot of flavor.  The service was good, we were not rushed. The dessert was great - especially the spumoni ice cream. We got an excellent deal at 13.99 for two for dinner.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"It's not the most fancy-pants buffet but you really can't beat the value. The salad bar is fresh and fills my veggies and fruit cravings. The dessert area is solid and the gelato is yummy!  They have some sushi, an asian section, Mexican, Italian, American, and some other fan fare. Lots to choose from and very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Well it seems like it is undergoing changes - used to be the best choice for us of the Station Casinos ..   their Asian section LOOKS good, but the Chinese Broccoli stalks are impossible to cut, the rice and pad thai noodles are decent but we don't go to a buffet for rice or noodles, really,   The Sushi is laughable - paper thin slices of salmon, and clearly they are buying the pre-,made sushi from a place looking to increase their bottom line by over- filling everything with rice .. the seafood salad offered has shrimp, bay scallops and clams - none of the clam shells are open - not a good sign and why would you serve that??    I'll not go through each station, but suffice to say we've noticed in a downhill trend here as of late. ..   they love locals money .. and now going public proves that ..  getting ready to pass on there too .."}
{"text":"No complains for a $10.99 per adult with their rewards card at the hotel. Food was nothing special but worth the price. They have a lot of variety. Recommended to visit and chow down if your in this part of vegas."}
{"text":"its ok ive had better..they need to lower the price to match the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Fake eggs??  The quality here has really gone downhill. It's the same as going to sunset station or palace station.   Do yourself a favor and drive a little further to the strip. Where they wouldn't dare serve garbage."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and it was the best buffet we had in vegas with a very affordable price :)."}
{"text":"Buffet seems as though they keep getting worse!!! It is already at a size disadvantage but i was here a week ago & Service was horrible couldn't even refill my Pepsi for lunch great you can cook me a burger because not much else offered standard tacos, pot stickers., pizza, fries they hace mashed potatoes but no stuffing they had meatballs with stale noodles hard & nasty No orange chicken... Dinner probably sucks too... I guess palace is only good for breakfast service still sucks but atleast breakfast is good"}
{"text":"To eat breakfast here you have to get there early. Long wait the food is average, but they do have an omelet station that will prepare it any way you like it. It was nice spending time with the family. I may go back but did not enjoy the long wait and small buffet options."}
{"text":"Just okay. Yes, prime rib was good. BBQ was mediocre. A long line getting to our table was a definite bummer. But we did enjoy desserts, salads, and a few main courses. For the price it was a screaming value, at lunchtime. So overall, we enjoyed it. The chicken was good. Asian station was good. Food was well prepared and overall we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I'm not a big spender when it comes to buffets, so this location is a great option for me. It is cheap and the food variety is vast and is usually very tasty. I normally come right as they are putting out the lunch food, so everything is fresh, hot, and plentiful.   The Feast Buffet restaurant is very large with lots of tables and booths. No matter if I've been here for breakfast, lunch or dinner, this place is always packed. Usually, I don't have to wait to be seated, but on occasion, I have had to wait for them to clean tables off.   Depending on when you come, they'll have a variety of breakfast stuff from made-to-order omelettes, pancakes, scrambled eggs, several potato dishes, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, breakfast tacos and more. For lunch and dinner, you can find items like pizza, mac n cheese, chicken, several Asian dishes, mongolian grill, pasta, Mexican dishes, desserts and much more. Oh yeah, can't forget the salad bar, soups, and bread station. Sure, this place doesn't compare to buffets on the Strip, but if you're on a budget, this is definitely a great option for you.   If you have a savings card you save a few bucks on your meal, so make sure to sign up for one. They are free! Also, if you don't have any cash on you, you can ask the lady at the register to add a tip to your check as you pay for your food before you eat."}
{"text":"Not the best buffet ever, but I love coming here with my family! Love their breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner! Never had any complaints. Would recommend."}
{"text":"This is a good, cheap basic breakfast stop. For the cost of coffee and juice anywhere else, you have have a full breakfast - complete with a freshly made omelet. Be sure to have their casino card to get the best prices."}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch by work, and just $7!  Beware the line can be long at prime time, so I go a little early like 11:30.  I love the thai fried rice, roasted garlic bulbs, buttery brussel sprouts, beef brisket with au jus, and terrific seabass baked with cream, cilantro, and tomatoes.  I've never had a bad plate there!"}
{"text":"Pretty satisfied with Green valley. Some sushi available. They have a station to build your own Mongolian grill, don't forget to tell them you want noodles if desired they don't add by default. There rest of the buffet is the standard fare. With a coupon I will come for a trip to the grill"}
{"text":"It is a buffet. So what do you say? One of the better in the station line-up. Better than GVR and cheaper. Does not come close to Red Rock though.  Food is good and there are always a few decent options. Just come in and have a plate. Cheaper than the restaurant. Plus the buy one get one coupons make it cheaper than a trip to Taco Bell.  I had down edit a star because of the ridiculous wait. Half the place was reserved for a wedding though so I guess I cannot knock them for that"}
{"text":"Horrible. My family and I have always thought this place was decent for the price. After last night, I don't think I'll ever go back. First off, the \"International\" food area was closed, so that food was added over in the American section, making that area clogged up. People standing 20 deep to get to the counter for food.   Food was AWFUL. The meat station had ham, turkey, and roast beef. Both times I got ham, they gave me a piece that was maybe 3 or 4 bites, turkey was ok, roast beef was way over cooked that even the very middle of it was well done. Anything else I tried was either dried out, no flavor, cold, or ?????. My son said the mac and cheese tasted like watered down noodles. The few desserts I tried were dried out and they are such small servings. I actually laughed at the \"jello shots\", they weren't even 1/2 a tablespoon full. Jello is so cheap, really? I went home and \"re-ate\" dinner.  I had a buy 1 get 1 free and was still mad that it cost me $11 for 2 people to eat, that's how awful it was. LOL!  Actually, negative stars would be more reflective of the nasty, inedible food they had last night."}
{"text":"It's a decent buffet for a reasonable price. The food is ok and the service barely ok. They're understaffed and you need to have some patience, cause they are not in a hurry."}
{"text":"Before I came to Feast at Red Rock, little me thought The Strip was the center of everything in Vegas. Apparently not.  A friend drove us out of The Strip, past deserts (which did seem sketchy and frightening) to this modern-looking resort. The interior was incredibly gorgeous in here; very nice-looking, contemporary seats and food vendors.  I think it's one of the best I've had in Vegas. They served very tasty slices of pork and what I kept coming back for was this mango mousse cup, just delectable! They have such a huge dessert section! In fact, they have so many different stations of ethnic food. It was quite a drive here but so worth it since the place was beautiful and very relaxing. I cannot wait to come back here again."}
{"text":"The food has gone downhill. Tasteless, not a very good selection. Quality of food terrible, the Mongolian  Station cook burnt food it was not for human consumption We spoke with manager and she apologized  And said to ask for creme brûlée at the dessert Station. She made it like it was a true secret specialty Dessert you had to Ask for it. We did not have to Ask for it it was out and was not even flamed on top It was all liquid and gross.  WHAT HAPPENED this place used to be very  Very good. It was father's day and as of jan 1 2104 They are no longer permitted to add gratuity to parties of 6 or more but they had their plaque right by the cash register that gratuity would be added to your check for parties of 8 or more. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Opulent hotel in every way. However, the buffet is the extreme opposite. The food has no taste whatsoever.   My imagination wonders is someone is in the kitchen extracting the taste from the food before putting it out on the buffet.  Even the fruits...cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon has no taste. They literally taste like nothing familiar.  I ate here a couple months ago and had the same experience but I did not do a review.  BTW, the staff at the front counter and the seating staff were all wonderful."}
{"text":"This buffet needs a lot of work. I frequent the buffet at Palace Station & the buffet at Texas Station falls behind. They are both the same price, but the quality and presentation this location is lacking."}
{"text":"This Buffet is located inside the Sunset Station Casino and Hotel. This location has a pleasant atmosphere, and it has a wonderful selection of foods! Everyone here seems to be very friendly, and the service is awesome! Their selections are the following and Asian, Italian, American, International, they'll have desserts and a salad bar as well!  Jackie E. was our server, and she's a very pleasant individual. She said she's been working here for 20 years and she enjoys working for the Sunset Station Casino.  I can tell she loves her job, and she is one of the reasons why we enjoy being here! I also observe that the other customers around us were very happy with Jackie E.'s service as well. Make sure you are to be seated at Jackie E.'s tables! She will serve you very well!  Your prices are very reasonable, and best than probably most buffets in the area! Keep in mind, that you'll need to have a Sunset Station Rewards player Card in order to get the best value possible!"}
{"text":"It is Friday, May 25, 2:07 PM, and I just finished eating dessert. I am still sitting at the table in the buffet as I want to reflect on my mediocre buffet experience while it's still fresh to my unsatisfied pallet.  We have a limited amount of meals to enjoy in this lifetime. Unfortunately this was a meal wasted that I can never get back.  There are multiple sections of the buffet so let's break down the mediocrity.  Sushi: don't even waste a single bite. I'm a big sushi eater, and this sushi is a waste of your calories. There's 1 boat of a variety of sushi with dried up hard rice. I risked it and tried some raw rolls as well and they were decent, but we'll see later today how my stomach fares. The sushi isn't even made fresh. It's all placed from a sheet pan with plastic on top that was pre-made and look like leftovers from the previous day.  International: What international? Some pita bread and hummus, baba ganoush, and a few curry dishes? Not impressed...  Asian: it's okay I guess. They have an Asian chef manning the kitchen and the food is good, but nothing special.  I can eat at Panda Express any time. When I come to a buffet I want to be wow'd!  Barbeque (yes they spell it with que): nothing extravagant either. Meat is dry. And they serve a lot of food that's there to make you full faster like baked potato, yams, mashed potatoes, and loaded mashed potatoes.  American: Interestingly enough I found myself eating from this section the most. The macaroni and cheese was the best dish I ate here today. Stroganoff was okay, the meat needs to be more tender. Chicken meatloaf is tasteless and a waste of calories.  Italian: A disgrace to Italian food. The worst pizza I ever had was at Olive Garden (never order pizza from there) but this buffet's \"pizza\" may look like a pizza but tastes like cardboard. I'd go with DiGiorno any day over this abomination of what they call pizza. The ingredients are fine, and they even use a brick oven! But the dough must be mediocre somehow...don't waste your time.  Pasta dishes are ehh, and sausage and peppers is ehh.  Pastries: Nothing blew me out of the water. Costco cookies are better than the cookies here.  Desserts: I have to say, their hand scooped gelato saves them. I would pay the $10.99 that we paid for lunch just for AYCE gelato to try all of the flavors. I tried Stracciatella (which they described as cookies and cream but it's more like vanilla with chocolate chunks) and strawberry, and they were on point.  With some apple cobbler, bread pudding, and chocolate and caramel sauce that you can add on, like I said, I'd pay $10.99 just for the gelato buffet alone.  Service was terrible. We had to ask the waitress for straws multiple times because when we got refills, she kept taking the old drinks with the straws in them. Then the new straws she'd give were bent or ripped or both...I also ordered sparkling water and there were pieces of crust or something in them from a not fully clean glass.  Would I go back? Yes, only because of the affordable price (when you show your Red Rock boarding pass/card) of $10.99 for lunch, but set your expectations low and you'll have a decent meal.  I didn't talk about the 'Farmers Market' section with various soups, salads, and fruit--this section is pretty good. It's what you'd expect.  I'm also tired of typing on my phone and I think you get the idea of what to expect when you come to this buffet."}
{"text":"It's kind of pricey. The line was super long. The food was just ok it was very bland with no flavor. They had a lot of choices though. The desert was the best part and the service was good"}
{"text":"\"You get what you pay for\" but for this buffet, I can't complain whatsoever! Breakfast, lunch and dinner is pretty good. Can't expect \"authentic\" Chinese food in the Chinese section so don't bother expecting FIVE STAR MEALS.. But for what it is, it's great. And for dinner the dessert section is awesome! The usual self-serve frozen yogurt machine is there, but they also have an ice cream section you can get served upon asking! And they have one section for sugar free desserts, and one section that isn't. (That's basically what really stood out to me). Haven't yet tried their Friday night seafood, but I heard the crab legs are huge!  Try this place out, located inside Sam's Town hotel/casino, and you'll see what separates them from the station casino buffets.. #iifym lol"}
{"text":"We have been to a lot of different Feast Buffets and there is a couple reasons why I would give them a solid 4.  The hotel itself is gorgeous! This is a place that you would want to walk around and take pictures. The parking is free and extremely convenient.   The ambiance in true buffet is stunning. From the decor to the set up, everything looks clean and attractive.  They have a great build your own stir fry station and a candy mix in station for ice cream.  This is something very different.   The sushi was fresh, the food was similar to other feast buffets but we did enjoy the variety!"}
{"text":"buffet was lousy couldn't talk to anyone who worked there nobody spoke english kids running around nobody saying anything to them there are plenty of buffets in vegas don't waist your money at texas station buffet"}
{"text":"This place is not bad for the price of a buffet. Ended up eating here three times too because of how cheap it is. The food is not bad as well. I love the meat station and how you can also make your own pasta.   Their desert was the best. Cheesecake is by far the best out of all the buffets I've been to. Their ice cream machine is really good as well and tasty.   Will come here again.   Basically you can get their advertised price For the buffet if you have the hotels rewards. Otherwise they will charge you $4-8 extra on top of their advertised price. It's all good though the rewards card is free so make sure to get it before going here."}
{"text":"$4.99 breakfast; $7.99 lunch & BOGO dinner.... How can you beat that price??!! Even with just the salad bar and drinks alone you get your money's worth!!! The food quality is just your average Vegas buffet but it's pretty tasty! I think all the Station Casino Feast buffets taste the same & I like that everything looks clean! Avoid dinner rush times if you don't want to stand in line~ We always request Arnold D as our server.. he's fast, friendly and always remembers us!   Hot Tip: make sure to get a free boarding pass player's card to get the most discounted prices!!!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday.  The price board at the register said $14.99 dinner, but they rang us up at $16.99.  Excuse me?  I pointed this out to the cashier and she explained that it is a seafood feast on Fridays, so the price is higher.  Okay, but couldn't you maybe get special $8 signs made up for your cash registers explaining this?  I mean, it's a minor expense, compared to the millions of dollars you dupe your \"customers\" out of at the machines every month!  Alrighty... you want to charge me more than you're telling me you charge, yet you offer me unlimited crab legs?  You fools!  Now I get even.  Seriously, AYCE snow crab legs.  Of course, they're on ice when you get them, and if you want to get them warmed up you have to go all the way to the other end of the buffet to the Asian area where they have a steam box.  The set up of the place has changed in the past 8 years since I first ate there, and it is most definitely NOT for the better.  Dessert selections, while tasty, are nowhere near as plentiful or accessible as they used to be.  Now you have to wait in line while someone behind the counter reaches into a display case to get your portion-controlled desserts.  Previously, they were all out in easily accessed choose-your-own-size glorious presentation.  Service here was marginal at best.  The foods other than the crab legs were mediocre.  This place has seriously gone to hell in the past few years."}
{"text":"This buffet is located inside the green valley ranch casino. We came on Christmas Day and they had a little of everything from prime rib, menudo, pork ribs,lamb, tamales, vodka ravioli, and a ton of other stuff. My dad ate the prime rib, and he had a couple servings of it because he said it was sooo good. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because for some odd reason there is no bathroom located inside the buffet. You have to walk out of the buffet and back into the casino to navigate your way around to find the restroom. Besides that everything else was amazing."}
{"text":"Typical Feast Buffet. My most favorite is the prime rib.   I like to put the aujus in a small bowl and dip the prime rib into it as I cut it overi pieces.   Keeps it really juicy."}
{"text":"I was visiting my mom who lives in Vegas (a retired stripper) and she recommended this for dinner based on her prior experience.  Be sure to pick up a \"Boarding Pass\" player awards card in the casino before getting in line to save you $2.00 per person.    A good selection of foods with salads, desserts, American, Italian, Mexican, Mongolian BBQ, & Chinese/Asian.  Crab legs are now extra per the cashier.  She was a little hard to understand.  I thought she was asking if I wanted frog legs, ugh, not so much. The Mongolian BBQ will cook to order a variety of and the Chinese had the best quality consistency among their offerings.    Definitely worth the drive and a little more refined than the usual Las Vegas Strip Buffet. Green Valley Ranch Resort is adjacent to a large shopping center with what appeared to be upper middle retailers."}
{"text":"We walked up to the cashier at 9:05pm, and they were closed. Cashier was extremely rude about this, and said the hours were on the sign. Nope. Not on the sign. It's VEGAS and the buffet closes at 9? SMH. We weren't the only ones disappointed, there were a bunch of people riding up the escalator as we left."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas. Since it's not on the strip, it's even better. You get to eat in peace without the obnoxious tourists (though, I'm a tourist when I go here too, haha). There's a big variety of food at this buffet and it's quite delicious. Its buffet is a full-scale buffet but with out the crowds you'd find at the strip. If you sign up for their preferred members card (which is free to sign up) you can save $2 on your buffet meal."}
{"text":"This buffet at red rock casino is pretty good compare to other station casino buffet, at breakfast they've a live cooking omelet station, cook to order, lunch they have sushi  which is so so, the pork roast is good, sausage and turkey are ok too, the salad station is the best, lots to choose from, dessert I like is the coconut cream pie...overall very good for the price...."}
{"text":"We come here rather often since we live close. We always feel like we get what we want for our money and enjoy what we get. Took a star away because they don't offer the crab legs anymore"}
{"text":"I would think this is what prison food taste like. Service was great but thumbs down on the food. Usually when your starving, anything taste good..NOPE!   You get for what you pay for here."}
{"text":"Best value in Las Vegas. .Henderson.  good selection. .good food. Not 5 star..3 and half stars. Get your free players card. The only non fast food for $10.00.   (If you can call fast food ..food) I  would like to thank the casino for veteran's Mondays in May. Half price and/or 2 for 1. Hard to beat. You can even save a few dollars more by arriving before 4...lunch pricing ends at 4,"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting this buffet. I had heard a lot of good things about it but I had to go and see for myself what the buzz was all about.  I came on a Friday night and as you can imagine it was pretty packed which is a good sign of course, and the precursor of what the food might taste like.   Well I managed to get in the buffet, first impressions were that it looked very clean, it was nice and organized and all the food stations looked very professional.  Visually the food look very appetizing especially the protein area with good prime rib, chicken, and other various meats.  I tasted food from the Asian section , the American section, Italian section, and the Mexican section and I have to tell you everything I tasted was very delicious!   I was not disappointed, the price to get in was $19.95 which is not bad for dinner and even better when the food is very delicious.  Before I left I tried the dessert section and the choices they have for dessert we're pretty good with a lot of variety. They also have a nice gelato section which visually looks very good, and fancy and the taste did not disappoint either.  Overall I'm giving this buffet 3.5 stars, it was a very pleasant experience and I will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"Food was great and fresh and the cost is reasonable at $18.99.  Servers are friendly."}
{"text":"Had a not so good experience during a recent visit when they had a special $10 dinner.  Line was insanely long..waited 1 1/2 hours, then appeared food was not replenished as it was close to their closing time.  Felt rushed and what I did eat was just ok"}
{"text":"The food was about as tasteful as school cafeteria gruel. Nearly everything that I tried was bland and flavorless.   However, the salad bar was fresh and flavorful according to my fiancé. I unfortunately was too disgusted by the other things I had tried to give it a shot.   The wait was rediculous. Over an hour. Got in line for breakfast at ten and finally got in at eleven. Just before that an older gentleman passed out just in front of us. The cashiers were totally oblivious until myself and another guest rushed to help and yelled at them to call security. Our server had the callous response to that saying \"if he was that hungry he should have gone somewhere else. \"  I expected at lot more from Red Rock. All of our other experiences have been much better."}
{"text":"This is one of the few buffets that I visit often because it offers a decent inexpensive meal that offers a good variety when we all feel like eating something different.   The buffet is a good size and has an adequate amount of options. Having been there often and on different days of the week, I can say the options don't vary much. I went on a Tuesday for lunch this time around, and my review will focus specifically on this day and time.  Out of all the times I have been here, this had to have been the most disappointing. My first plate I had mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, stuffing, corn on the cob, ham, pork tenderloin, sausage, hushpuppy, and a side of potato salad, orzo salad and a bread roll. The mashed potatoes, or really any of the potatoes I have tried there, are very good and I always go back for more. The mac and cheese and stuffing is no big deal, tastes just like boxed. The corn on the cob is deceiving; it looks like it's flavorful but it's not even sweet, it's more like a mouthful of water. I only took a few bites of the ham because it was too plain. If it had any glaze, it sure didn't taste like it. The pork tenderloin was moist. The sausage is another favorite of mine, it's always cooked just right and never varies. The hushpuppy and bread roll were decent. As for the two salads, the potato one was delicious and flavorful; however, the orzo had an odd texture and did not taste good to me.   The person who accompanied me got meatloaf, fish, meatballs, mini cornbread, and what appeared to be creamed spinach. The only problem was the creamed spinach, which was freezing cold even though it was right in front of the carved meat at the meat station. I don't claim to know much about creamed spinach, but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be cold.   My second plate consisted of pizza, meatball, spaghetti, cheese filled ravioli, baked ziti, lasagna, and a breadstick. All the pastas pretty much tasted the same, although my issue was with the lasagna. Either they put the wrong pasta in the section labeled lasagna or they don't know what lasagna is, because they did not even use lasagna noodles. The sauce was pale and it looked completely unappetizing. The pizza and breadsticks are pretty ordinary, same as all buffets.   The desserts this time were very disappointing. Usually they have a good variety, but this time while they had cookies and cakes, it was the kind of cakes that look pretty but they all taste pretty much the same and I didn't see any cheesecake out. I had a small chocolate cake roll, bread pudding, apple crumble, and a danish. The cake roll was awful- dry and very little chocolate taste. As for the danish, I couldn't even tell if it was strawberry or raspberry or what because the fruit center was so dry. The apple crumble was ok. My favorite was the bread pudding, which I put a little vanilla sauce on, and it reminded me of a mix of flavor between churros and flan. The person accompanying me sampled the sugar free cherry pie and sugar free cake; I tried a piece and there was no flavor at all. They were the worst sugar free desserts I have tried there.   If you're looking for an inexpensive buffet, I think this is a good option, however, keep your expectations low. It's not going to be extraordinary, but you will get plenty of options."}
{"text":"Not the best buffet in town, but the service is good, and desserts are excellent.  Nothing too impressive, but decent."}
{"text":"My personal pledge to reserve Vegas buffet outings for out of town guests only went out the door this past Friday as the Husband and I  checked out Green Valley Ranch Casino's Feast Buffet.  Friday and Saturday nights are Surf and Turf nights from 3:30 pm to 10 pm, which ultimately means AYCE crab legs and whole roasted pigs.  It's normally $21.99/pp or $19.99/pp with a Stations Boarding Pass.  But for the month of November, an additional $3 is discounted - making dinner $16.99/pp!  (And with my coupon in the mail for BOGO free buffet - that meant $16.99 for two people!  What a deal!)  The line was already long when we approached the restaurant a bit after 4 pm.  It didn't take too long for the line to get moving though.    There were hoardes of people in line for the crab - specifically the steamed crab legs.  But then there was this other line - you can have them stir-fry your crab legs however you'd like.  Ultimately, you grab your crab legs (or other food items), and then tell them what sauce you like and how spicy.  You can skip the wait and get cold crab legs and it's all the same.  This is what everyone swears by and the reason the Feast Buffet at GVR does well!    Other unique items at this buffet worth mentioning were the clams on the half shell, something I couldn't indulge in sadly enough.    But they do have milkshakes to order, which I was more than happy to help myself to!   Other useful buffet info:  Breakfast: Monday - Friday: 8am - 11am $7.99 per person or $6.99 with Boarding Pass Card  Brunch: Saturday - Sunday: 8am - 3:30pm $20.99 per person or $18.99 with Boarding Pass Card AYCE crab legs  Lunch: Monday - Friday: 11am - 2:30pm $10.99 per person or $9.99 with Boarding Pass Card  Dinner: Sunday - Thursday: 3:30pm - 10pm $20.99 per person or $18.99 with Boarding Pass Card AYCE crab legs"}
{"text":"Great quality for an amazing value. We came for Sunday Champagne Brunch and it did not disappoint. Grace was our server and she did  an exceptional job. I applaud the entire staff from Cashiers to Hostess to Omelette Station and Meat Carvers, everyone was kind and accommodating. There are alot of buffets  out here but this is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting, yummy food.  The price ($20) for brunch includes unlimited champagne.  You cannot beat this!"}
{"text":"This is a $9.99 buffet pretty far from the strip, near where my mom's friends live.  My expectations are never very high for a buffet, but I wasn't too unhappy here.  Our server was very attentive and kept our drinks refilled pretty well.  The salad bar was very fresh, I enjoyed my salad.  Things I tried that I liked: BBQ pork spaghetti w/meat sauce sausage w/ peppers and onions meatballs berry cobbler fresh bacon crumbles potato salad  Things I tried that I did not like: Cheese ravioli (too mushy, bland flavor) Veal ravioli (bland) Pad Thai (bore no resemblance taste wise to pad thai at all) Bread pudding (truly awful)  If you want to fill up with halfway decent food for cheap, far from strip, not a bad choice.  It's not gourmet but isn't pretending to be."}
{"text":"I have been dining here since this place opened. Recently returned after a long absence for Sunday Brunch and was extremely disappointed.  Food was between cold and tepid, after I notified the waitress she went into the back and told me she told the head cook about the problem. At least a half hour later someone came out and checked the temp. Unfortunately he only checked 3 different items and seemed to care less. The foods that I found to be cold were from several areas. I heard several people asking to have their food heated. I expected better from Station Casinos. Can't justify returning. Too bad, used to be a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Good job to Green Valley for bringing back the crab with the grill station.  This is EASILY the best setup in Las Vegas for a buffet if you like crab legs on Friday nights.  They brought me in with the buy one get one offer and they kept me there with the quality of the buffet.  We stopped coming here when they stopped serving the crab legs with grill station because, while it is a good buffet, it is not much different than the other buffets in Las Vegas.  5 Stars with the Friday night crab grill.  Way to go GVR!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service,   Pablo the manager is very rude. We we're a family of 5 adults and 3 kids that had 3 different tabs were not allowed to sit together because we weren't charged gratuity which is suppose to be the case if you have a party of 8 or more. We asked if we could sit in the same section and Pablo said no or he would have to charge us gratuity.   We then spoke with the waitress who sat us in the same section. We were seated a two tables for 4, when we asked if we could get a high chair they said no because the table is only for 4 and we were a party of five.   Does any of this make sense.....  Each kid was under the age of 4 and was charged $14.99. They barely ate a plate. Each adult was charge $15.99   That will be the last time they received my money and I will be reaching out to corporate.  Pablo needs more training or perhaps he should be working the buffet."}
{"text":"So tried it again after having told myself I would never again visit in my life.  It didn't hurt that it ended up being free with my player's card comps.  Anyway, we went for dinner and the selection was amazing.  The food quality seemed better than before.  The only negative is the weird layout...where everyone is gathered in the middle section, because that's where their best food is.  Now, since the buffet is actually quite huge and LONG, I would suggest they spread out the popular stuff.  And our streak of bad servers continued, as we never got our drinks refilled.  But in the end, I guess I'll be back."}
{"text":"Dont like the LONG wait, 1 hour on a sat morning at 11:10am. Def works up your appetite. Nothing rare or special on this buffet, but most things are consistently good. Service from Oliver was great. The price is right and the dessert section is very nice (all the pies you want, and icecream)"}
{"text":"My family eats here about every week, mainly for breakfast and lunch. However, we have done dinner, especially on their special menu days. I would say though with dinner that besides the special item (i.e. bbq, prime rib or holiday) that the rest of the items are pretty much what you see during lunch. A regular day might include turkey or ham. I like the choices of sausages in the bbq section. This past Wednesday which must be their typical slow night, food doesn't seem to get refresh a lot and dessert is lacking. Overall though we've had friendly staff and breakfast/lunch is very budget friendly!"}
{"text":"I didn't take pictures because you can already see them in others. Nothing has changed food wise.  Service: Amazing. I didn't notice when we came back from our first round the TWO sets of drinks. I had thought she got the orders wrong. Nope. She brought two at a time. Amazing. Not intrusive, and cleared plates before we even left to back. If we didn't switch so much in the seating process I would know her name.  They kept seating us in places others where already sat.   Thank god I had cash because if you elect to pay by card, you need to tip at the counter. I just hope you had as good of a server as me.  The food: this is where the stars come into play.  Soups: every single one that was self serve (minus the tom yum) was caked. Like no one had checked it in hours. Not even stirred it. So didn't touch them. Tom Yum: very basic. They put three shrimp in it, but nothing that gives it the actual flavor.  Sushi: fish was good. Can't complain! The rice though seemed from last week. Wasabi was on point! Spicy and fresh.   Prime Rib: was good. The lady behind me wanted more rare. They had like five servings left of the one. They wouldn't even cut into the other one for the guest. Even as it was sitting there.   Veg: was ok. Broccoli was way UNDER cooked. Green beans are hit and miss.   Cheese bread was good, as was ceviche surprisingly.   Just a little more attention at this buffet and it would live up to the best of Vegas. Till then still going to Cesar's or Bellagio."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Between customers the server at the ice cream counter was eating ice cream with a spoon which she dipped into the tubs of ice cream from which she was dishing the patrons their ice cream.  The server took three tries to get out drink order right and then left one straw for four drinks and walked away (did he not understand English well enough?).  The orange juice was watered down, the sweet potatoes were burned.  Go anywhere else to eat would be my advice."}
{"text":"Came here with low expectations based on the Yelp reviews. The wait was a bit long despite the fact that there were many open tables... Don't remember other (better?) station properties being this slow. Food selection was decent, nothing surprising and they got the base of everything, Italian, Asian, American, etx. and dessert galore! For a neighborhood buffet I was impressed with their dessert selection. It can take forever to flag down someone for a water refill but other than that, no complains."}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best values in Vegas for buffets. Very cheap and decent selection. It is typical in its offering and nothing mindblowing but it does have a tex mex section. I have been to aa few feast buffets in town and they are all similar . Just stay away from doing a late lunch here because the food will be old. But price wise it is a good way to save a buck. Also word to the wise. They have higher prices on the weekends even though it is the same stuff. So stay away then."}
{"text":"If you're from the Bay Area and are a compulsive gambler, I mean, buffet lover like me, this buffet is similar to The Feast Buffet at Thunder Valley Casino.  It has the same name, same look and feel and when TVC first opened, it was a Stations Casino just like Green Valley Ranch is.    We had dinner here on Easter Sunday so pretty much, they raised the price to $25.99 for adults and the only difference is that there were a tray of Peeps in the dessert station.  Apparently if you're a Stations Casinos player card holder, you'll get a discount.  Every little bit helps.  But focusing on food quality and selection, let's face it, no one can top the buffets of the big box luxury casinos, i.e. Bellagio and Wynn.  But at the same time, you're paying almost double, if not more.  With that said, the offering at The Feast were decent, probably a little too basic meaning, they served the typical Fried Chicken, Mashed Potatoes, Pasta, Pizza, etc.  They had your usual Asian, Italian, Mexican, American and Seafood stations.  The Salad Bar was nice as they had a few mixed salads, antipasto and chilled shrimp.  I'm really surprised that they didn't have any crab, especially with the premium in pricing.  Overall, The Feast was a nice buffet but certainly not the best out there in Vegas.  As far as in Henderson well, Studio B has The Feast beat."}
{"text":"By far one of the best buffets in las Vegas!"}
{"text":"i come here about once a month. I only come when i have a discount though. Otherwise I don't feel its worth the drive unless its practically free to eat there. My husband is never thrilled in the least bit when i suggest it. The food i very very very hit or miss."}
{"text":"The food was cold, but the chef making the omelets was the fastest and nicest person I met all day!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for cheap buffet with player's card.  Breakfast & dinner buffet better thank lunch.  Would always visit the Mexican station & have carnival street tacos.  Fried chicken very good as is the pizza.  Hottest ticket seems to be the soft serve ice cream/ sherbet dispensers and dessert selection is always good.  Also appreciate the coffeepots for coffee. Don't have to worry about refills.  Could do much worst unless you are into fine dining."}
{"text":"For a buffet outside of Las Vegas, it's not too shabby.    No crab legs on this night, but still a decent buffet with many other choices to pick from.   But since I have to rate buffets anyhow, I give it 3 stars for the price you are paying for this buffet and the choices you have here.  Service for the person to get your drinks can be extra, extra, extra slow.   It would be better if I can go get the drinks my damn self.   Nuff Said."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with transition to lunch buffet.   Again, Omelette Station.     For the price of $15.12 for two people for breakfast, this buffet gets it done and then some.    Can't compared it to more expensive buffets on the strip like Aria and etc.   I'm a buffet eater, this is a decent buffet for the price. It really is."}
{"text":"This review is for the attitude and rudeness of the workers. Not only are they cold and irritable at the cash register but I couldn't believe my eyes when one of the food servers didn't have the patience to wait for an elderly man who was getting steamed carrots. She pulled the tray of carrots out while he was still reaching for them with the tongs so she could replace the tray with a new tray of hush puppies. (Yes she saw him) The carrots from the poor man's tongs spilled out everywhere, some into a tray of stew.  This was the most disrespectful thing I have ever seen in all my dining experience. It's strange to me how they put so much effort into putting out decent food but they put no thought whatsoever into the character and attitude of their staff. For me, a general darkening of the mood by rude service people makes going back unthinkable."}
{"text":"This is actually not a bad buffet for a smaller type of Las Vegas style buffet. For $10, you got yourself a pretty tasting buffet with prime rib, pasta station that makes great pasta, hamburger grill station that grilled and build your burger the way you want it, Plenty of fresh fruits and veggies, a few Chinese entrees, some Mexican, Drinks included,  and the rest of the salad bar. Their dessert table is not bad! Lots of varieties along with Ice cream :) On the holiday they brought out the prime rib and charged an addiditonal $2 per person. Not bad at all! Their prime rib tastes justs as good as Wynn's buffet's prime rib!  Honestly, how much can one eat at a buffet bar? I'm stuffed with a piece of prime rib and a piece of chicken, Paying $30-$40 for a buffet really is not worth it for our family of smaller appetites. So we'll stop by here to grab a $10 buffet and substitute with the other grand ones.  $10 and $7 with a players card, no waiting hours in line, food is pretty decent, and savings goes to the slots machines :-).    I've eaten at some of those cheapies buffets in Vegas, and this one tops everyone of them."}
{"text":"A buffet for $11.99 with players card, you can't complain.    The line moved super fast.. They are really efficient at getting people in.  They have a lot of OK food.  Not bad, but nothing to rave about.  Lots of variety though!  Try their prime rib, it's really good.  Their sushi was actually better than most buffets too (although they didn't have any Ginger which is a must for me!).   The atmosphere is real nice too.  Very clean and open.    For 11.99 dinner or 6.99 lunch, and even a 4.99 breakfast... chances are, I'll be back just because of the price."}
{"text":"Found in Red Rock Hotel & Casino in Summerlin. Reasonable price for a decent buffet. It carries a pretty large selection. Also having a 2-4-1 coupon helps! Regular(non players card) dinner price is $18.99 when I visited a few weeks ago, if I remember. I believe the cost of this Feast buffet is slightly higher than their other Feasts at the other Station casinos in the chain."}
{"text":"I was already at Texas Station for something else with a friend and we decided to eat here. Sunday brunch/dinner for $9.99 per person(with player's card) is hard to beat. Food is decent, fairly large selection. Bumped it up to 4 stars from 3.5 since the service was great. $7.99 lunch & $4.99 breakfast with a player's card also being offered at the moment."}
{"text":"Dinner review: NO seafood variety, especially crab legs. Only seafood you'll get are dried up salmon or cod (at American station), super tiny shrimp w/nasty marinara sauce (at sushi station), sauteed clams in bean sauce(at Asian station). Maybe it was that particular night that I went, but nothing tasted like it was supposed to be. For instance prime rib was super chewy, chicken tasted like rubber, grape tomatoes at the salad bar was...unexplainable, even mozzarella cheese - at the salad station - did not taste like cheese. I'm not a picky eater and LOVE all sorts of cuisine. However, quality of food here is horrible.  This was not my first time here, but I'm considering it to be my last. Other buffets, at a less fancier resorts have been better.   Waiters are always attentive though - you will not go thirsty."}
{"text":"40 minute wait at 7 pm on a Thursday. Loads of empty tables, not enough people bussing them, very poorly executed. I watched countless people walk away. Maybe they intentionally slow the buffet to feed people to the other restaurants in the casino? The soda tasted like Vegas pool water, they need a water filter. The salad bar was good taste wise, but only had 40-50% of your typical toppings. No olives, bacon bits, or such things, the salad bar seems like it was there to check off a buffet requirement box, not bring people there. Food was hit and miss. Pizza looked weeks old, stuffing and turkey were good, ham was dry, fried spring rolls were good, the mint gelato was great. Average food, above average atmosphere and very clean, I wasn't worried about getting sick. Would go back mainly due to how clean it was."}
{"text":"Finally made it back for pleasure not business. Ate at the buffet three times wasn't disappointed once.  Felt bad for the omelette nazi tho - his tip jar was full but these two rachets behind us fixed that! The guy didn't deserve that.  We will be back fo sho!"}
{"text":"I came because I valued the cheap buffet pricing ( player card and 2-1 boho buffet from the casino book I got) however I was very surprised how far it is from the strip . I came at 4:30 pm and the line extended almost out the door. (30 mins wait)   This was bad for me because I had a show to catch in MGM at 7pm.  I would say unless you live or are driving near by, you should avoid going here because for the mileage and so forth , not worth it."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for breakfast and enjoyed the buffet for $6.99. Very cheap! Good food selection for the price. The omelette bar was the best. But the cheap price comes with slow beverage service and ghetto people. When we were in line to get into the buffet, two ladies tried to cut after getting out of line and buffet staff ignored it. And in the omelette bar a lady cut in line to join her friends, I politely asked her to get behind the line but she refused, I dropped it because she did not look too friendly. I've had better quality and variety food at Vegas buffets but certainly not for $6.99. Overall, the food was good!"}
{"text":"This buffet has a good breakfast for only $5 you definitely can't beat that price and it seems that everyone agrees because it is always busy here for breakfast on the weekends.   What I don't understand is breakfast is very busy most times that I've come but they only put breakfast items into a small area of the buffet and close the rest of the station. This causes long lines and is ridiculous. I don't order omelets so I don't wait in that line but yet there are 15 people in line JUST to get meat for their breakfast (sausage, bacon, hasbrowns etc) They definitely need to spread this out so that there isn't a cluster of people.   Lunch is $8 and the food is average, not great but definitely not bad at all. I do enjoy coming here.   Desserts are definitely lacking here and they have a very small selection"}
{"text":"Looking for a cheap way to be a fatass?  YOU'RE IN LUCK BUDDY 'OL PAL!  My socially-challenged friend and I took a trip to this place because I won a little 2-for-1 coupon after I cashed my check at the casino cage and drank my life away. But that's another story.  The food here isn't exactly top notch, but I'm not crying over it cause I paid six dollars for two people. You get what you pay for. Nonetheless, there is still some tasty shinanigans to be had here, just whatever you do, don't get the fried tofu nuggets or whatever the hell they call them. They are definitely rotten. So was the tiramisu.  Also, lots of old people. Eek.  The choices aren't as broad compared to other casinos, but fuck it they had spaghetti and that's all I need.  I buzzed away from here a fat little happy hummingbird that didn't give two fucks about no diet soda, and that says something!"}
{"text":"***YELP 100 CHALLENGE 61/100***  I have been to this buffet several times both lunch and dinner. It's not the best buffet around but for the price it'll do. There are far more inferior places in some of the casinos on the strip that charge you twice if not triple the price. Breakfast is $6.99, Lunch $8.99 and Dinner $13.99 prices are with players card discount so make sure you grab one before you head down to the buffet, it gives you $2 off. Children 2 years and over are full price.  Last Saturday we went for brunch, after waiting in line for what seemed forever, we finally got in around 11 am. They were just starting to put away breakfast items to give way to lunch fare. Surveying the selections I didn't see much that was appealing to the senses but I managed to snag some waffles, bacon and some potatoes for the little one. I tried their Spinach benedict, the taste was just okay, but at least the yolk was runny and not overcooked. Chorizo and egg was good and they had all the trimmings to make a breakfast burrito so that was a plus. The omelet station was super busy so I skipped that. I decided to try some Asian offerings and actually liked it: Tom yum soup, good broth and didn't skimp on vegetables and shrimp but I would've preferred to have it a little spicier like the ones you get at the Thai restaurants (no option for it) The chicken with green curry was very tasty and satiating. The pork bun was good as well, again not skimping on the filling. Great bun to filling ratio.   The dessert station underwhelmed me though, was very disappointed with the selection, rather the lack of choices. I thought they would at least have crème brulee, that would've made me a happy camper already. All they had were a couple of unappetizing slices of cakes, gelatos, cookies that looked stale as heck and bread pudding. So I settled for a scoop of coffee gelato and a brownie. Gelato was too sweet instead of the somewhat bitter taste you would expect from coffee."}
{"text":"Buffet was ok, nothing special.  Went here with a 2 for 1 deal , don't think I'd come back to pay the regular full price."}
{"text":"my food was so plain no taste to it --i tried the wok with the meats and vegs it was dry and bland-my  husband had the fish it was dry too--only his chicken was ok and the mashed potatoes--our first server was a man and very helpfull he went to have a brake and the next woman was so bad never asking if we needed anything at all--not a good eating experience--"}
{"text":"Once again this buffet more than meets my expectations for a budget-priced buffet. All of the offerings are extremely fresh, there are some made-to-order stations & the selection is huge. Actually a nice place to take an out-of-town visitor if you don't want to spend an arm & a leg. You won't find shrimp or crab here during lunch, but there's always a nice fish offering on the Asian station. I was sad to see my favorite salad, bleu cheese & walnuts & cranberries, was no longer premade for me. They had all the ingredients in a separate area but I put too much salad dressing on & it didn't taste at all like my old favorite. Ahh...my other go-to, the red bean sesame balls, were still there, fresh out of the fryer, or wherever they come from.  Once again I was lucky enough to have a 2 for 1 coupon which made our breakfast/lunch $8! Gosh, taking that into consideration they deserve 5 stars!"}
{"text":"It's 8.99 for dinner, if you play they send you lots of 2-1 coupons, so you can have a date night for $10.  Not that great, but lots of good food, always leave stuffed.  With all the variety and deserts you can't make it yourself for the discount price."}
{"text":"My family and I went for dinner on a weeknight. The line was pretty long but we finally made it in. Everything from the staff to the food was great! The dining area was super clean. All of the food was super tasty. The salad bar was so good. Everything tasted fresh and had a lot of flavor. The bonus was the beer or wine addition. The entire staff was so nice and even offered to get us a boarding pass just so we could get the discount. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"my favorite buffet in vegas! foods are various and delicious, the music is great and people who work there are very nice. prices not very high  I looooove it!"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and nothing special as meals, we waited for almost an hour to have a table. I was very disappointed about food especially seafood which was just some pieces of sushi. this can't be a good choice for buffet"}
{"text":"It's incredibly cheap for a buffet, but then, it's an incredibly cheap buffet. Foodwise, nothing here was particularly good at all. Everything was fine, but not a single item made me think, \"that's good, I'd like more.\" To make matters worse the service was horrific. I left my table to go the buffet and when I got back there was a dirty rag and tray on my table. I sort of paused as I approached this disgusting sight and the waitress scooped up the items with a \"I thought you were done...\"   No apology, no offer to re-seat me or clean my table, no explanation of why she thought I'd left before actually making a single trip to the buffet."}
{"text":"We had dinner last night and the experience was terrible. The food was tough and dried out, the fruit was luke warm, everything looked like it was sitting out for a long time and no one cared to swap out the food. I Never had this kind of experience at a Station Casino, we always had great food, but Sante Fe was a huge disappointment. The manager should be ashamed of the food quality they allow their team to present. Never will go back and it's unfortunate because we live so close. The service was even lousy, took forever to get our drinks and that's including the waitress having to come back and ask what we originally ordered because they went over to clean a table first."}
{"text":"It is what it is...a Station Casino buffet.  The good is just okay and the line is usually long.  It's not bad and it's not good...nobody got sick and everyone left full."}
{"text":"Went for lunch for the first time. I usually go to The Feast for brunch. I was going to go to my usual lunch spot (crazy pita, Panera bread) I was hungry and I wanted to get more bang for my buck. There was no line for the buffet, I was happy about that. I was seated right away by a friendly staff member. my server  introduced herself and then called me beautiful, how I could give a bad review after such a warm welcome. The place is large, clean and organized. It's fun to try a lot of different things. You do get more for your money. I think They are appealing to an older crowd. Some items tasted bland like the wonton soup, very little salt. A lot of the items have very little or no salt. Other buffets have more seasoning but other buffets have a different crowd.  There was some miss labeling. They had a sign for Albondigas soup but it was not albondigas soup it was something else. Im giving 3 stars because of the lack of seasoning n some items. I would recommend brunch"}
{"text":"Over rated.  A lot of options, but most of the food was mediocre at best.  Be prepared to fight for your food- lots of rude tourists fighting their way in before the meat stations, etc.  Desserts were disappointing.  Be sure not to sit to in the section close (and open to) the casino- or all of your food will taste like smoke!"}
{"text":"We love Red Rock and have enjoyed many of the other restaurants on property.  The buffet is terrible.  Poor selection.  Prime rib was good.  Everything else was mediocre.  Even for the moderate price it was a big disappointment.  Would not recommend or return.  Much better places to eat on site and in the area.  I'd pay extra to go to one of the much nicer buffets on the strip."}
{"text":"Make sure to become a member to receive a discount at the buffet.Get here early for breakfast!!  The omelets are the best!  We also enjoy there flame grilled  cheese burgers, pizza, and fajitas. You also cant forget to order a 99 cent margarita! Enjoy 1...or ..2...or maybe 3.. lol (they are delish..when u mix up the flavors! ) Evey time we visit Las Vegas we] go to the Feast Buffet. Why not its the BEST CURE for a hangover!!  ..don't forget to tip the hard working staff..who provide service with a smile :)"}
{"text":"Wife and I visited this buffet a few days ago and it sucked big time.  We literally didn't find anything that tasted good.  We both agreed it wasn't worth it.  We love buffets just not this one."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much being that Feast is a buffet but was pleasantly surprised with their $9 bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon. Their prime rib for the evening was tasty and I liked that they had fresh horseradish paired with it.  The carnitas on the Mexican part of the bar was juicy and delicious with plenty of flavor. I also tried the ham from the carving station twice and found it thoroughly enjoyable. Sadly I didn't have room for dessert. I really wanted to try the coconut cream pie. It looked great.  Plate service was quick  and the restaurant was clean and a great value for $10 a person. For $30 the husband and I had a nice quiet dinner out."}
{"text":"We went to the Feast buffet for Christmas dinner with some friends. Other than the line the experience was great. The food was fresh and delicious all around. Back to the line though....1.75 hours to get in at around 6-630 PM Christmas night. Our servier said that was the shortest duration she had heard to that point when we were seated around 8 PM. Yikes! I didn't take the line into account since it was Christmas and I've never seen a line like that there in other trips to Red Rock."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait in an epic long line for the dinner buffet.  Bring your patience.  That being said, the food was really worth the wait.  The price is phenomenal for the amount and quality of food offered.  The salad bar had a nice selection and was very fresh.  There are a ton of options from all different types of cuisine - sushi, mexican, bbq, italian, american, chinese, etc.  there were so many selections, that you couldn't even try everything even if you wanted to.  the bbq ribs were really tender and flavorful.  i didn't have one bad thing there.  the dessert selection is really incredible.  i had the chocolate pudding pie and it was so yummy and surprisingly light.  they have fresh scooped ice cream too - i didn't try it - but it looked really good.  The service was decent as well.  I would definitely recommend this buffet for the food and the price, but like I said, that line is crazy, so just be prepared for it."}
{"text":"This buffet has some of the most horrible customer service. It's 3:15 and there is no one ANYONE in sight at the cash registers and a long line. 3:25 and someone comes over to say they'll start letting us in at 3:30 because they don't want us to pay lunch prices for dinner. Umm okay. We're all waiting to eat why not just charge us dinner prices and let us in? Dinner doesn't start till 4:00. I can go in eat and be out before then, so why charge me for DINNER? Makes no sense. But I decide you know what I drove all the way over here might as well wait. It's currently 3:46 and no one in sight even remotely making their way to the register.   Let's say even if for SOME reason y'all want to charge extra which is understandable because some people purposely try to pay lunch prices and stay for dinner, why wait an hour before \"dinner\" for you to accept any payment for the buffet.    It's 4:00 and still no one accepting payments for the buffet. I would've been gone if my fiancé hadn't taken me here as a surprise date.    Let's just see how the food and service is.   We were the second group in line. We got seated at 4:10 and immediately went to get food. Food was okay. The quality of the food wasn't worth the $25 a person but it's all you can eat so I guess for the quantity it's good. I only really liked dessert tbh. Everything seemed pretty bland."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come if you want the Las Vegas experience without the crowds and price. The food is good and so is the service. There was a varied selection, including a taco and salad bar!"}
{"text":"I was at the Red Rock hotel and casino with my family early on this July. The food was very good for the price. A lot of selection friendly service staff and great for children especially if your children are picky eaters. We went there often and were never disappointed."}
{"text":"As for buffet value, this place is a very good buy.  We live in the area and their everyday breakfast, lunch, and dinner prices are a bargain, so we're frequent customers.  On Holidays, their one price will be fixed for the entire day, so call to confirm.   They offer a wide selection of meals and their prime rib and turkey/chicken entries are exceptional on any given day.   There's also a good variety of dessert.   I usually head for the stir-fry counter, but they're sometimes not available.   For breakfast buffet, at the section where omelet is cooked before you, be sure you specify clearly how you want it cooked, otherwise it can be cooked hard.   In whole, the meals and selections are very good.   We go there often and have always been greeted and served by friendly and courteous staff.  Consider their 99 cent margarita when pre-paying your meal.   Also,  check out their Bowling Center for their day- time special $1.00 per game price."}
{"text":"I thought this place might be okay since the other Station Casino Buffet in Green Valley was good. I came here for lunch because it was close and I forgot to have breakfast.. thought I might catch up.. wrong place to do that.., everything was pretty plain even for me. I walked around and everything was lacking in presentation and flavor. Lesson learned ..now time to start over on level one ; ) !!"}
{"text":"Went for surf-n-turf night over the weekend. Good selection but quality varies. The \"turf\" of the day was roast beef tenderloin which was quite tough and dry. Just get your fill of crab legs--cold, steamed, or custom sauteed to your level of spiciness. If you do the latter, the cooks toss your portion of crab legs in a very flavorful sauce of fresh chopped tomatoes, green onions, parsley, and I think chili oil. The combination may not sound right but it's good! Just about every table around us had a plateful.   Also complimentary wine in one corner."}
{"text":"the food is horrible! theres one red meat option, 3 chicken options, and 1 fish option. the red meat option is supposedly brisket that looks like pork meat. the chicken marsala should be renamed chicken and throw up. the food was room temperature. the wait to get a seat away from the casino smoke is 20mins plus and the tables are filthy"}
{"text":"Cheap prices, but GREAT food! Been here twice and I got nothing bad to say about the service or food. I had my first breakfast buffet here and went for dinner also. They had everything you can think of for breakfast! NONE of the food was old, or sitting out for a long time. Small place makes everything easy to get to and not crowded either. I would love to go back."}
{"text":"If you're hungry on a Friday afternoon during lunch time, you don't know where to eat, and only have $7.55 cents to your name, this is the place to go.  For that price, you can get a lot of food and drink in your stomach.  It's not the best buffet, but it's definitely a great price.    By the time I was done, I was so satisfied.  My belly was about to explode.   Sad part is that on the way there, I kept telling myself \"You are not going to over eat, you are not going to over eat, you are not going to over eat!\"  But, what happened?  Geez, this is why I don't do buffets.  But, it was cheap though, so I shouldn't complain.  :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Sunday brunch, has everything you want. From 99 cents Margaritas to endless mimosas as part of your purchase. The best little secret is in the salad bar where you can make the biggest lox you want."}
{"text":"This spot is located at the Santa Fe Station and though it is probably inconvenient for tourists, its excellent for the locals especially with these prices:  Breakfast $8  Lunch $9  Dinner and weekends $13   When i am in town i try to make time to go down and eat here, the food selection is very similar to the Rio carnival buffet where each station is divided up by each type of food like Asian, BBQ, Mexican, Italian, American etc.... The kicker is again the price.  Highly recommended if you want to grab a quick bite to eat and if you hate waiting in long lines to eat at a good quality buffet. The waiters also are very tentative on keeping your beverage full of your favorite drink."}
{"text":"We went during their Sunday brunch which turned out to be $20/person. For just $5 more, you could go to the famous World Carnival Buffet at the Rio Casino which offers WAY, WAY, WAY more.  The food here was just \"meh.\" Nothing special and nothing out of the ordinary. For the price, I thought they would offer more but they don't. I guess the interior decor makes up for it. The Red Rock is a really nice casino - but their buffet just didn't really do it.  We only came here because we didn't want to drive - and we wanted to try something new. Next time, we'll stick to something we know."}
{"text":"The only thing I like this place is the price of $11.99 for dinner. If you got a promotion coupon even cheaper. The setting is like a budget cafeteria, same as the food. There are quite a variety of food station but all not that  attractive nor tasty, even the salad bar look sad. However the service is fairly good. It is out of the strip so parking is not an issue."}
{"text":"Okay so this isn't by any means the best buffet in Vegas.  However, with their free player's card (called a Boarding Pass), M - Sa at $6.99 for breakfast (7 - 11am) and $7.49 for lunch (11am - 4pm) and with even dinner being $8.99 weekly 4 - 9pm, think of it as an alternative to fast food.  You could spend seven bucks at McDonald's for a single serving of not that great food, or come here and pick and choose what you want and leave entirely satisfied for about the same price, if not less.  Think outside the box and take advantage of this buffet when you have time to relax for lunch.  Especially good after a gym workout.  There comes a certain satisfaction with pigging out for a mere seven or eight bucks, and truly, the food at this buffet is not bad at all - certainly a cut above the greasy buffets of gone Vegas years when we were kids."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 4, my husband would give it a 2 so I split the difference here. We ate here for prime rib night.  Amazing salad bar, all sorts of options for eating so many different types of food. My prime rib was relatively tender and nice and medium rare - though a thicker cut piece would have been welcomed. I also enjoyed their fresh fruit and their sushi (not a lot of choices of sushi but it was good). Wanted to try the roasted pork and some other things but just didn't have enough room in my tummy. It's not fabulous food but what do you expect for an all you can eat $16.99 dinner."}
{"text":"Look around for cockroaches!! We found one on our table!! I showed it to the Jackelyn the Manager and all she said \"Im sorry, I will have my guys spray again\". Really, how about \"I will call the health department on you guys\""}
{"text":"It was one of the better places to eat at the sunset casino and besides I did not have to pay and if I did it was $9.99 for dinner, not bad for prime ribs beef nite, no line, probably all th casino are hurting for business.. it is really 3 1/2 stars,but since yelp doesn;t let us elect 1/2 stars?? The food was way better than seafood night at the gold coast??? But you do have to trek thru the old smoky casino to get the feast buffet and for sept they are having a promo to get free buffet, need to earn so many points(like spend$) to eat free for that day??"}
{"text":"I, myself, am shocked at how my POV on Feast Buffet has changed!  From 2 to 4 stars...how does such a thing happen over the course of half a year??  Let me first say that this is a decent buffet, nothing more.  I think my expectations are at the right level for this place.  When ever I go to a buffet, I have this compulsion to eat everything and stuff myself because that's just what \"buffet\" means to me - eat until you feel so incredibly uncomfortable doing anything, even sitting.   One of the reasons why I keep coming here is because my friend gets 2-for-1 buffet coupons in the mail, via the Player's Card.  A nice saving.  When using that 2-for-1 coupon for Saturday breakfast ($7.99) @10am and stay until brunch is served = even bigger savings.  I get breakfast and brunch for $4, flippin sweet deal.  At that price, I can eat decent food quality any time.    Typical buffet options: sushi, Mexican, pizza, Asian.  Fresh fruit, bagels w/ 3 spread options (regular, strawberry, chive + onion).  They have self serve frozen yogurt, gelato (cup or cone) and an assortment of pies.   Recommended dishes: - chocolate croissant: hit or miss, sometimes they have it - chocolate pancake - cornbread: surprisingly good, not too bland, hint of sweetness - pork bun: nice size, 2 bites and you're done  TIP for you: get a players card & gamble a lil bit to get those food coupons"}
{"text":"This place sucks.... Yeah... It's cheap... But I'd rather pay a little more and actually eat a real eggs benedict breakfast instead of eating hard poached eggs with no hollandaise sauce ... Can i say it was .... CRAP O LA..... Don't waste your dinero.... Rather have eaten micki d's ... That's what ill do next time."}
{"text":"This is one of my Favorites! Went for lunch this time. I had some roast Turkey slices and some Ham also..mashed potatoes and gravy. A little bummed out that there was no stuffing that day on a Friday, but I've noticed they don't serve that item except on Sundays. This time I also enjoyed their pot stickers. They were so delicious, I sorta have a soft spot for Chinese and American comfort items! I tried this amazing shrimp dish with spinich and mushrooms in a very light sauce, it was amazing. The wait staff is very very nice and catering to its customers. It's always nice to eat here. The atmosphere is comforting, relaxed and super enjoyable. I really commend the wait staff, Kudos to you'all Untill the next time!   Highly recommend, keep up the good work, Station Casinos"}
{"text":"I don't understand some of the hate....it's a lunch buffet for under $10. You eat a couple burgers,a few pieces of fried chicken and you are ahead. I don't usually eat Mexican food outside of Taco Bell but seeing how the majority of the staff seemed Hispanic,there's a good chance that this is some authentic dishes. Grab a few ice cream cones for the way out. I'm not saying the food was awesome but I'd easily rank it over the buffets at the Luxor and Excalibur."}
{"text":"Platinum status member ya'll!! And I definitely reap the rewards I get from Station Casinos. Which includes 2 for 1 buffets. So I go with my family once a month and we all enjoy the good food! I am a huge fan of their spring rolls and sugar-free cheesecake! SO So good!! The staff though sometimes can get rude and I once saw a waitress ignore a table simply because it wasn't her table and she wouldn't bother to go find the right waitress. Other than that, get there on time to not wait in line!!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and it is a very popular place at the Boulder Casino. If you can't find something to eat here then you must be extremely picky. There was everything from fruits to pastries, to make your own omelette, Mexican, American, cuisine. At. $7.99 for all you can eat with beverage it's pretty hard to go away hungry. Their coffee is also very good and you get your own carafe at the table. Everyone l saw looked very happy and very well fed. Their lunch and dinner deals are also inexpensive and from what l saw as l walked by during those meals there was an abundant and awesome selection."}
{"text":"Coming from me a 3-star buffet is pretty remarkable because a standard buffet for me is pretty much always 2-stars. Anything is better than a buffet! So, with that being said, I am generally satisfied with the selections at the Feast. I have had breakfast, lunch and even Thanksgiving here, and I have never left angry, which often happens when I am dining at a buffet.  They have all of the usual suspects. The salad bar is always fresh. While the flavors might not be amazing, nothing has ever been bad. The place is clean and well-organized. Definitely have your Station Card so that you can get your savings.   There isn't anything that stands out, like beer being included or some fancy mashed potato bar. Okay, maybe that was a bad example, but some buffets have something signature that really makes them stand out. For me, Feast Buffet is straightforward. It's a buffet done without failures, but without anything too remarkable. Wait, they do have kimchi! I find that pretty special, but for most, that's probably not too much to get excited about."}
{"text":"ok  but could be better...staff friendly food mediocre....make sure you get your card....I was going to have this buffet a second time after waiting ...I swear like 10 minutes with 2 people in front of me ....one was a family ....get up there realize  i don't have my card left it in car...she says we can get you one and sent me to another line that was like a bus full of italian soccer players 20 people long ...went to in and out burger .palace station screw's me over again .."}
{"text":"Well it's Sunday and the place seems busy but not to where we have to wait to be seated, but we did. Then I asked the manager how long the wait is, and she said we are working it and walked away. Then she asked my sister it we were ok....  Not the best way to start off the meal.   The food was good, it's wasn't old like it had been sitting for a while... That I was appreciative of!  Out waitress was attentive and friendly!   I'll come back for the food, but hopefully the manager is fired."}
{"text":"Came with my family and they wouldn't sit us together since we didn't pay together. The food wasn't good, it was old and tasteless. They didn't change the food out the whole hour we were here I guess they didn't want to waste it. Bowling was clean and fun, but will go elsewhere to eat."}
{"text":"Feast Buffet is located on the Casino level of the Green Valley Ranch Resort. We tried this place upon recommendation of family living in the area and we were not disappointed. The lunch buffet was $6.99 (including your drink). How can anyone not like this price? Prices are lowered for the month of January but that would mean no crab legs, which is fine since I don't care much for them.  They have a great selection of different kinds of foods I didn't even know where to start. They offer your traditional American food as well as Italian, Mexican and Asian. I believe there's a salad section but I didn't get a chance to check it out. The desserts were my favorite section and it's also the largest :) They have so many different kinds of cakes and pies, cookies, muffins and ice cream.  The service has been great. The waitstaff would always check on us and make sure our drinks are refilled. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We got a chance to eat at Feast buffet twice for free since it came with our Groupon deal for a stay at Boulder Station Casino. They have a breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffet and you get a discount if you sign up for the free players card. You really should sign up for the players card because you do get a pretty decent discount. When you go, especially during lunch time, expect to wait in a long line. The seating is limited and you have to wait to be seated. This buffet is like a glorified sweet tomatoes (if youre familiar with this chain). It has an Asian, American, Barbeque, Salad Bar, Dessert, and Mexican station. The quality is so so but like any LV buffet, you feel like you need to be rolled out once you finish. You can hit or miss at this buffet. Corn on the cob is pretty hard to butcher but the ones I got tasted like you were eating cardboard and the kernels felt like what you get out of a frozen mixed veggie bag. I really enjoyed the garlic alfredo pizza and overall i was overwhelmed by the amount of food available. I guess if youre really hungry taste doesnt really matter much. The waiters are able to get you drinks and if youre wanting alcohol options, you can pre-buy these at the counter. Be sure to tip the waiter because they really do work hard. Although the stations offer international options, they are clearly the toned down version because it lacks the authentic feel. All in all, Feast buffet is a buffet and if i had the choice, I wouldnt drive to Boulder station for the buffet but since I stayed here, it was reasonable."}
{"text":"For a breakfast buffet with buffet food, this was pretty darned good.  The buffet is extensive, comprised of at least 4 different stations.  One has traditional breakfast items including eggs, an egg dish of the day, traditional meats, etc.  Further down the line, there is an omelette station with plenty of options.  Next is a Hispanic section with huevos rancheros and the best chilaquiles I've ever had.  I live 1,700 miles away, and I can't wait to visit again, just for the chilaquiles!  On top of all that, there is a huge square station filled with just about any fresh fruit and fruit salad you can imagine, grits, oatmeal, yogurt, and muesli with several toppings.  The atmosphere is typical resort buffet, but no complaints.  Good coffee, good service, good breakfast."}
{"text":"How have I lived a mile from this place for 2 years and never tried it?! Big mistake on my part.   Do you love crab legs? This buffet is a crab lovers dream (should specify these are only snow, not king, for all you crab snobs!). Going to go on a limb and say best buffet crabs in VEGAS! Yup, I said it. Skip the Rio, forget waiting in line 2 hours at the M  - freaking go to GVR.   So the magic behind the crab legs is the \"Grill Lady\". Put your plate of crabs in front of her and she will make magic. Butter, Garlic, green onion, and whatever spice level you desire. Crab legs grilled to order? Oh hell yes! I didn't understand how the grilling of the crab legs would increase flavor (they are in shells after all), but damn it works. The flavors permeate the cracks in the shells and turn your boring buffet crab legs into a plate of deliciousness!   Oh did I mention this buffet never has much of a line (15 minutes max!) ? Or that if you just sign up for the Station Card you get $2 off (bringing it to $18.99) PLUS a B1G1 free 1x/month! Yup, our crab magic was only $10 each last night!! Crab legs are 7 days a week for dinner, no need to wait for weekends!   Ok so the bummer is , the rest of the food blows. As I was doing low-carb last night, I didn't get to try much. However my husband did, and yup, it all sucks. The pizza was ok, otherwise not much to write home about.   So if you don't like crab legs, you don't matter anyways - get out of the buffet line and don't take up space on my crab eating tables. For the rest of us sane people, this buffet is an awesome value - and I swear the grill lady will have you hooked !"}
{"text":"I went to this buffet for my graduation dinner. I was very impressed that the hostesses were prepared about the 15+ people that came and joined me to celebrate this special occasion with me. They were fast and efficient seating us.   Food. It was great!!! I would definitely come back BUT on a different night! There were so many options and good flavor. I tend to lean towards the prime rib - awesome!!   Service. It could have been better. The waitress that took care of the party was great! She was very attentive and helpful. I used to be a local in Vegas and knowing about customer service because I used to be a waitress it's a hit or miss. When my friends and I got up for seconds, one of the employees who cut the meat was being extremely rude to my friend until I came up behind her and he immediately changed his attitude. Once we got back to our table another waiter approached us and said \"we close in 5 minutes. Okay guys? 5 minutes!!\" And walked away. He was extremely rude.  I barely had time to cut my cake and serve it to everyone.   At the end I was very appreciative with the waitress we had, she did an exceptional job.   Not sure if I will ever come back or recommend this buffet to anyone."}
{"text":"We went on St. Patrick's Day and I can honestly say the only positives were the price, the roast beef and the desserts. I'm not exaggerating when I say EVERY other dish was lukewarm at best. Seriously, the mac and cheese was excellent, but the Mexican and Chinese dishes were below average in taste and temperature. It's a shame because the food was kept fresh and in smaller bins than most buffets, meaning they're rotated more than other places.   If the entrees were hot and a little more flavorful, I'd give four or five stars."}
{"text":"cheap and food not bad. i rather pay the cheap price to get sth that worth the money.... better than i pay over $40 to have buffet at bellagio just for the crab legs"}
{"text":"Yelpers, please note that the price you pay for other buffets are 3x the price you'll pay for Feast Buffet so don't expect the selection or quality to be the same.    It's like comparing steaks from Denny's to steaks from Gallagher's (New York - New York Casino.)  The higher the price equals higher quality.  Friendly service and great staff.  Can't complain."}
{"text":"This the worst example of a buffet waited 15 minutes before waiter came with drinks. Waited in the line for twenty minutes to get in. Horrible food. Don't send anyone you like there."}
{"text":"for an area that has rampart and the suncoast, the feast buffet is a good deal. the omelettes by art in the mornings are top notch (hope he still works there). my only complaint is that the service is a little on the poorer side. however, it doesnt take away from the great meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic Buffet. The price was awesome for the quality and quantity of food available at The Feast Buffet. The buffet was regularly about $22 but if you sign up for a player's card it's $5 off. I appreciated the fact that the cashier told me about that before I paid. The downside is a three year old is $17.     The barbecue area at delicious prime rib. There are cuddle within book expected in a cafe. The Jerk Chicken was delicious. The pot stickers are also very good. The shrimp for small and seem to be a little old. My girl still had a fun time killing the shells and pulling legs up. The tomato basil soup was fantastic.  My wife said that the pizza was good.  She also said the salad bar was good and had a lot of variety.  The sushi was also really good and tasted very fresh.  Unfortunately they only offered Pepsi products. The other downside we felt like was the dessert bar.   And believe me, we tried about everything they had over there between us.  The Highlight was the gelato. The Spumoni was delicious."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Texas station since it opened. Went to breakfast with my son 6/24/2016 and used a comp to pay since I do gamble at stations. I was so disappointed at the choices of foods put out for patrons. Over half of the buffet was closed and what was set out was very poor quality.  The supervisors need to walk into that place and pretend they are a customer to see if the choices were available for people to eat.   The staff was ok but nobody was eating the buffet and I'm guessing because you are not putting out a good product.   Just shut the doors instead of the poor effort you attempted to give the paying public."}
{"text":"Where should one begin when describing this buffet first off if you can wait in this long line that takes about a half hour to an hour to get through then you're more than patient.  Next the food is mediocre at best as it has some stuff blan food that isn't award-winning.  Overall, it's a station buffet (this is supposed to be there best buffet ) but I believe its a 2 star rating.  Lastly the cashier Maria is not a friendly cashier who doesn't understand about discounts, nor accommodating guest.   Also, the othet cashiers hardly  care to work as they continually run off.  Overall, avoid this buffet if you can!!"}
{"text":"great breakfast buffet  for very low price"}
{"text":"If you have a kid 2 years old, do not go to this place. They charge for FULL PRICE! This is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"It's ok.  I had a BOGO coupon.   That's the ONLY reason why I came here.  I got some coupons in the mail for boulder and palace station. I thought the BOGO coupon was good for the boulder station casino, but when I got in line,  the cashier looked at the coupon and told me no,  it's for the palace station, so I got out of the buffet line, hopped in my car,  I drove my happy butt over to the palace station.  The buffet prices there are like $1 cheaper.  With my coupon,  I paid $9 for 2 buffets!!  I have another coupon for September.  Overall,  the buffet SUCKEDDDDD, it's small and DO NOT SIT IN THE BOOTHS! It's so hard to get up and the seats are NOT comfortable!  Sit at a table instead."}
{"text":"Basic, simple Station casino buffet. They have the same items just like all the other neighborhood buffets. It was clean and easy to navigate through.  I went during lunch, with people I didn't like.  I really didn't enjoy myself like I would have wanted to. Blahhh"}
{"text":"I gave this buffet a two and that's being generous. Everyone was nice our server was nice of course, I tipped two different servers because I thought our first server left for the day. I caught the lunch buffet which is $7.99 per person. I had a $5 off coupon which expired literally in a few days so I had to use it right away!!!!!! Ughhhhh!  The food was just your basic American, Italian, Chinese and Mexican dishes. Oh, they had \"street tacos\" (tacos el pastor) which I should have tried, but of course I didn't... they had hotdogs and hamburgers. Now, I did not come to the buffet to eat hotdogs and hamburgers LOL,  which I can buy and prepare myself lol.  BUT, overall the Texas buffet can stay at a two or maybe two and a half if they had shrimp cocktail but they don't have shrimp cocktail sooooo...whatevs"}
{"text":"Would make for an outstanding buffets for dogs, raccoons or other animals. Even in the depths of a very dark bender I would not be able to consume anything here."}
{"text":"The only food good here is the carnitas pork. That it! Plus I had to pay full price (9.99) for my daughter that Is 2 years old and eats like half a piece of pizza, broccoli, carrots and ice cream. Would not go here again. Worse of all the stations buffets. If you're looking for a cheap station casino buffet that tastes good, hit up red rock. It's about 15-20 mins away from this one but way worth it!"}
{"text":"Not too shabby for a buffet. We came on a Thursday evening so we missed out on any weekend prime rib or seafood specialties but the standard fare was pretty decent. Some of the standouts in my opinion were the fried chicken and the fried shrimp. I can't remember much else. Even though most of the food wasn't memorable, everything seemed hot and fresh and nothing looked unappealing. Buffets always have something for everyone and the buffet here definitely seemed to offer plenty for the locals. I probably wouldn't go out of my way for this buffet, but it's suffices for being THE buffet at Red Rock Casino and Resort."}
{"text":"This was a good Buffet we had tonight. The food was all prepared fresh, and the service was really good. The thing I like most about the Buffet is that they served Liver, and onions. Very few places serve it, and very few places can prepare it well, they did. I always enjoy going to this buffet."}
{"text":"Before we left Vegas my husband and I wanted to eat at a \"cheesy\" Vegas style buffet. After looking at the obscene prices of the buffets in the area my brother suggested we eat here.  I was very surprised a how you weren't able to smell smoke inside the restaurant. It made the eating experience that much better. They had a huge variety of food there. A lot of the food was hit and miss. I was disappointed in the \"Asian\" part of the buffet. Everything from the noodles to the veggies were all mushy. The pizza was very good (for a buffet) and so was the Mac and cheese. It was kinda like playing roulette with the food. You get a scoop of this or that and it might be delish or it might not be.  For $12 a person I thought it was the best deal in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came for weekday lunch. I believe this Feast is the most expensive of all the Station Casinos. Of course you can save a few bucks with the Station casino card. Unfortunately, I didn't have B1G1 and kids are still full price.  There are two lines and when you miss the cutoff at 10:45, you'll be charged for lunch. Even when their register system are down to check for points, the line just comes to a complete halt.   Where we sat was just strange. What I mean by that is, first we were as far away from the buffet as possible. (Which was fine). However, the layout of the tables were one way on one side, and opposite the next row. So when you have to carry your plate of food, you have to navigate left, and then right, and repeat.   The orange juice here taste awful, but the cranberry juice is excellent. The coffee was awful as well, it tasted burnt.   My favorite stations here was the Chinese food section. The stir fried boy choy was excellent, and the char siu was above average.   As for fruit, there were only watermelon, honeydew, cantaloupe, and it was not good. All the salads were always half full at most and always running out.   The carving station had chicken that wasn't cook through.   So I just went to dessert and the chocolate cream pie tasted doughy and no sign of sweetness.   Our waitress was great in the beginning and disappeared for a long time. But then again, I did see she had at least 10 tables.   Quite honestly, go to the Red Rock Station Casino, it's a LOT better."}
{"text":"First of all, kudos to the cooks here. Just about everything here from Asian, to Mexican, to Italian and especially the desserts are excellent here. I've been here previously for lunch, and yes that was excellent too. This Feast Buffet is basically the best out of all of the Station Casinos. Thus, I came here with the Family and even though I paid $13.99 for each kid who ate your one taco, one pizza, and one ice cream, the food was still excellent.   So why am I giving this place two stars for tonight's meal? Well, I have to say getting in to this place at 6:30 was a cattle call. I don't mind staying in line but what I do mind is the treatment of people like me, who was totally neglected as a paying customer.   In case you don't know, there are two lines. One is the president's club, which I don't belong to this 1% and the everyone else's auntie and uncle's line for the other. What I didn't appreciate tonight was a series of events:  I didn't appreciate one of the ladies in red shirts (who apparently walks around and enroll you in station rewards card) took people out of no where and walked them in front of us. Granted I don't know who they are and I don't assume, it irked me a little.   2nd, there was a lady 3 person ahead of us, who then called her whole family of six over and they walked into the president's line and of course in front of us. But not only that, these family were tall, like 6 feet tall and had a stroller and while waiting by the wall, the cashiers couldn't see us. Why? Because we were in the furthest line away from sight. After standing for 10 minutes, I made it known that we were waiting and the cashier told me they were waiting for the line to die down. In the meantime, that same cashier took in the people in the President's line for another 5 minutes.   You try waiting with tall people, in a cramped hot area. Guess what? That irked me a little more.  And when it was finally time to be rung up (almost an hour later), the same hostess asked us 3 times how many were in our party. I'm not sure if I was tired or hungry, but I was already more than irritated.  Not to mention that the sushi selection looked broken with hardly any out, they didn't replenish the 2nd time I went back. (That or it must've been the best thing there)  Normally, some hot food and great service would solve the problem. I'm not sure, but even though I ate everything (BTW, fresh pineapples was excellent, orange chicken was excellent, the lemon sorbet and creme brulee was just delicious.), nothing made my night any better. I thought I would tell the situation to someone but I would sound like a total bitch whining about the above right?   Well, I decided to write about it and have you see this experience for yourself. I've been here for lunch and the wait bearable. Hence, that's why I came back and took the whole family. Unfortunately, maybe it was not meant to be and I caution you from coming here during peak hours for dinner like me."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely disgusting. Everything was so dry and looked like it has been sitting there for hours. I'm not picky at all when it comes to food but i will NEVER come here again!! Plus you ask the cooks a question and their rude!! On a good note, our waitress was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Eat till you drop!  As I have been getting older and very sadly finding it increasingly challenging to drop a couple lbs, I have become a less frequent visitor of Las Vegas buffets. Every extra spoon of rich food seems to need an extra mile of jugging or 30 extra minutes of gym time! With that said, I find the buffet at Red Rock Casino to be one of the better ones. The quality is pretty high, and there is a lot of variety. I am sure while quality or variety may differ depending on the time of the year you are visiting (quieter times are the best!), it is still up there with the best that Las Vegas buffet world has to offer. So if you feel like indulging yourself, go there, pile up the calories, get in your car, make a left on Charleston Blvd and drive straight to Red Rock Canyon National Preserve where you can hike a few trails and burn a few of the calories you just paid for in Feast Buffet!"}
{"text":"It's a $12.00 lunch buffet, the food matches the price, nothing to write home about but if you have a hole in your gut that needs filling cheaply this would be the place. If you have a club card the lunch is only 8 bucks. I wouldn't come here just for the buffet but wouldn't complain if I was eating here."}
{"text":"My family and I were in the Summerlin area and desperately wanted to go to a buffet so our friends suggested Feast Buffet. Since there were small children in our party, we knew that we wouldn't be making our way down to the Strip just to go to Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal, so we settled on Feast Buffet. Although the prices are amazing, I could see the wait being a little long, especially if you have a large party.   I noticed that the restaurant itself was clean, aesthetically pleasing, and the service was phenomenal! The buffet is set up according to food groups (ie: Latin, Asian, Italian, American etc) and they have a dessert bar on the corner. Everything I had was SO good, except for the dessert bar - the dessert bar was lacking a lot of the desserts advertised, which I assumed was because it was near closing time.  Overall, I would highly recommend going to this buffet if you have large parties and want good food!"}
{"text":"Let me be clear...the crabs get 5 stars. Only go on Friday for the crab legs. Mama Sarah....knows what is up."}
{"text":"2 AYCE for lunch on a thursday afternoon! 8.00 each with boarding pass  - We actually got it the 2 buffets FREE. I was playing slots and the machine wouldn't print my voucher. o___O.. I had to wait 30min, but I guess it was worth it bc they comped me ^___^ - 5min wait time at 1:30pm! GREAT!  - Love the tacos! SO much sour cream! Although taco meat is a bit drippy.. - No sushi. Red Rock has sushi -___-.  - Mongolian BBQ for Asian section. Pretty lame. Noodles gross. - Fried chicken with ketchup and some potato wedges. KFC! do grilled? KGC! - Eclairs for dessert!

Not as wet as Sunset Station - BBQ ribs bonus! summer special!  - Chopped sweet potatoes! At Sunset, they give you the whole piece!"}
{"text":"Now the Medley Buffet, We came here on a Friday for lunch for $9. We used 10k points for $10 of dine-in credit.   - Like a Feast buffet but a different Chef. They took the chef from Red Rock.  - They have a buy 1 for 2 promo Mon-Thurs only. - Ribs are tough. - I come for the Mexican food! Yum!  - Make yourself taco fries and meatball tacos with sour cream!  - No sushi for lunch - Single price is $9 with players card but at a station casino, it's $8.  - Fried chicken is worth getting - Leave with an ice cream cone! - Good value."}
{"text":"This is one of the bottom of the barrel buffets in Vegas. I compare it to Hometown buffets. It's steam table food. I don't like that at all. I felt it had been sitting in the back way to long. I ate the corn, Ice Cream and the soda. I know I would have been sick if I ate any of the other food. My stomach is way to sensitive for that kind of food. I'm far from a prude but it's just not good. Having said this I guess you can find something to eat for $10.86 a person but I wouldn't waste my time. Add $10.00 and eat one of the great buffets in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was good. Choices were many. As Station Buffets go. This is the better one we have been too. Granted it was Prime Rib Saturday. $15.99 was better than the Seafood Night at Green Valley for $30 a person.  Santa Fe had a better selection of hot vegetables and they were regular veggies. Not the fancy ones that no one eats.  Btw the Prime Rib was awesome."}
{"text":"A little disappointed with the taste and quality of most of the food. The salad bar is very lacking. Service is always great considering the volume of people they serve."}
{"text":"This place is now called Medley Buffet. Located inside Aliante Hotel and Casino, a locals casino, this small buffet can be found. The only reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars is because of their \"Hawaiian\" night every Tuesday. They have Hawaiian treats such as Kahlua pork, pineapple upside down cake, etc.   But the real highlight of Hawaiian night is their lechon...which would grab any Filipino's undivided attention! This was the only reason I went here on gym night. We got a table, grabbed a plate and looked for a big flock of Filipinos. If you see a big group of Filipinos in one spot, it's either they're gossiping about somebody or there's lechon in that spot! There's a reason why Anthony Bourdain calls lechon \"the best pork\" he has ever eaten! I love pork too and I like cochinillo from Madrid and lechon from Cebu called Zubuchon. Lechon is normally served at an important event such as a wedding, graduation, baptism, family reunion (or whatever reunion) and birthdays. My excuse is it's still my birthday.  So we found the lechon...chopped up and ready for the pickins. Ooh, there were bottles of MANG TOMAS to dip your porky treat in. A testimony of legitness. I filled my first plate of just lechon: meat and crispy skin...and a spot for Mang Tomas. I don't eat rice because I'm a weird Asian. The meat was nice although there were some parts that were dry. Tip: for juicy pork, pick the part closest to the bone. If you want fatty, tender cuts, get the belly...the only down side to that is you could be crunching on pig nipples. But whatever. Eat the skin while it's still hot. I know most of us like taking lots of pictures of what we're about to eat so we have something to post on Yelp and social media websites...you're putting yourself at great risk of stabbing/cutting your gums if the once crispy pork skin gets cold. Lechon doesn't let you mess around! It's serious business. The only fine detail they forgot was the apple inside the pig's mouth.  They have the usual buffet desserts: pies, cakes, gelato, frozen yogurt/ soft-served ice cream, fruits, etc. i like the frozen yogurt and spumoni gelato. I tried the pineapple upside down cake which was more muffin than it was cake. But I still liked it.  So yeah, LECHON TUESDAYS!!! Hoy! For only $20 you can eat as much lechon your arteries would allow you to eat before clogging up and if you/ your tito/tita, ate/kuya have/has an Aliante players card, it's only $15/person! Compare the savings if you got your own lechon for $100-200 depending on the size of the pig because nobody in town will sell lechon in small portions - you get the whole pig or none at all."}
{"text":"Always visit this buffet when we are in town. Always good food and good service. We have had Kendra as our server the last few times and she is always friendly with a positive attitude. Highly recommend this buffet."}
{"text":"Came here on a BOGO free offer on Friday night which is their seafood night. Price if you have a players card is $27.99 & $32.99 if you don't. Because Red Rock is part of Stations my expectations weren't too high (I know I know, I probably shouldn't think that way), but my overall experience was very good. We arrived around 5pm before the rush & by the time we left (probably around 7) there was a decent sized line. Our waitress kept checking up on us & our table was never full of old plates. There's also a complimentary glass of wine. My favorite were these scallops on an oyster (I might be wrong) shell that were AMAZING, I kept going back for more.   Will I be back?! Heck yeah! Only if I have an offer though. Maybe next time I'll try their breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Buffet was great! They always have such a large selection of good food. Always come here and it never disappoints. Will be back plenty more times in the near future."}
{"text":"This review is on the prime rib dinner buffet. If you have the membership card I believe the prices around $25 per person and I know if you don't it's five dollars more but don't quote me on the price. I'm not sure what the price would be for the regular dinner.  The buffet is nothing extraordinary but I'm going to base my review on the prime rib since that was the main highlight of this buffet. I think the prime rib was pretty good however it was slightly salty on the crust but once you get to the middle part that it was really tender.  also it seems like it is on the more medium rare side so if you want it to be a little bit more cooked well you just have to tell them and they can do that for you.  Dessert was fairly good and they have a pretty good selection of pies and gelatos but other buffets in Las Vegas areas are pretty similar as well"}
{"text":"Worst.... Ever food was ok service was the absolute worse the clean plates are dirty when this was brought to the management attention they shrugged it off. The restaurant is dirty and unsanitary trash in the food prep area. We went to the breakfast brunch. Not only did the charge us 15$ each when its advertised 10.99. they then explain its 10.99 with players card they did not give us the option to sign up or look up our card. # which can be done its been done at every other station casino. We where here with a small group the wait staff tells us there is a 2$ per person charge to sit together. We said not no but Hell No so the staff sat our part in 3 different parts of the restaurant separating our 75 year old and 93 year old disabled members from the family. They didnt charge us this fee the previous day. We find it interesting half the employees are wearing pro union badges and the other half anti union. Hopefully real managers see this. Our group who stays at this hotel every other month and eats here every month will not forget this we will go where we are better treated"}
{"text":"Have to update this and increase my star rating.    I've since been here for lunch and dinner as well as holiday brunches and it's always been an excellent meal.    The food options at this buffet are terrific.  My favorite is the Mongolian wok.  I think that alone is worth the price of the whole buffet!    Even the gelato milkshakes for dessert are heavenly!    The price is great if you're a boarding pass member.  They send buy one get one coupons almost monthly.  My biggest gripe is the line.  It can be flat out awful.  I've waited almost an hour to get in there on a Sunday night.  You have to make sure you're not starving when you arrive, otherwise you'll just be cranky and pissed once you get your table.  Other than the line, this is one of my favorite buffets around!"}
{"text":"The service at this Feast Buffet makes the GVR Feast Buffet seem like a 5 star restaurant in comparison!  First of all, this one also has the ridiculously long breakfast lines that, when you're hungry, feel like they're taking a year to get through.  Drink service isn't nearly as good as at Green Valley.  I asked for whipped cream in my hot cocoa and they told me to get it myself from the dessert bar.  Really?  And they don't have the same things as GVR.  I went to get a bagel and they only had the mini ones.  I guess that's why GVR is more expensive, but I'll drive a little further and spend a couple of extra bucks next time if I really must have breakfast buffet."}
{"text":"Not a place to bring a child, they charged full price for a baby that was 2years old. The cashiers was not friendly and couldn't hardly understand English. My sister ask why are we paying full price and maybe not a discount price like any other businesses, she told us that even if it was an arm baby coming in to their establishment they would be charged the full price. I don't agree that is why I am posting this comment in order for parents who have several babies is not subject to such a ridiculous practice. As far as me and my baby, and our family will not be eating at the feast till she is able to grab freakin plate her self. Golden corral here we come."}
{"text":"Dang, I missed you. Every time I get that 2 for 1 coupon in the mail I think about it. But then I think about the 20 pounds I've gained since I've moved here and I have second thoughts. Sure you can eat healthy at a buffet, but that just ain't my style. Those waffles, gelato, dessert bar... dangggg.    On the serious tip, probably the best locals buffet alongside Green Valley Ranch's Feast Buffet.  -1 for the incredibly long lines to get in. If you want breakfast on a weekend, get there at least an hour or two early."}
{"text":"We'd heard good things about this buffet, but we were very disappointed. After waiting in line for 15 minutes, we were seated and we placed our drink orders. The drinks were delivered and then... nothing. We were never approached again. Service was awful and we were almost treated contemptuously. The prime rib was pretty good, but everything else was meh. The desserts, how ever, were bad. Very few choices and bad tasting. No 'sugar free' choices at all.  For all hype casino buffets get, you can just skip this one."}
{"text":"Came here one morning while staying in the hotel for the breakfast buffet. Overall it was a pretty satisfying buffet. The food was good and there was a good amount of things to choose from. The buffet was not overall outstanding so I reserve the 5 star rating for other buffets but this one was really good."}
{"text":"Its Definitely a locals casino and buffet more so than other Station Properties. The Feast buffet is upstairs and takes some navigating to find if you come in thru the parking garage. Its not the biggest buffet by any means. You can stand by the salad and do a 360 and see all it has to offer. But its delicious. For 6.99 for lunch with boarding pass card its decent. Dont go in here expecting The Cosmo buffet. Its a older casino and older buffet. They revamped Boulders Feast buffet and at some point they may revamp Palace's buffet but again inside Palace they make it known they really cater to locals.   The food was fresh and the trays always stocked. The Customer service from start to end was definitely great. My soda was always full and she kept our table cleared. Had a tasty margarita pizza. The pork chops may of been sitting out for a while it was a little dry. And the brown sugar for the sweet potatoes seemed to be sitting out a little to long because it was hard as a rock. Besides those two little drawbacks if you want a reasonable buffet with great customer service and good food for less than a meal at Mickey D's or Burger King or any other fast food establishment i would come in here. And i didnt visit the little burger bar but they looked tasty and people were devouring them for a reason."}
{"text":"I thought this buffet would be on point since Red Rock is a nice hotel and casino. But it was severely lacking. The pad Thai bland with to much spice. The salad section wasn't on par with other station casinos. The Mexican station the meat was tough and dry and seemed to be out to long.  The sushi had way to much rice and couldn't distinguish one piece from another. The raw shrimp and brisket was delicious. The dessert bar needed more attention on the hot side as alot of trays sat empty. Then a guest lost his dinner all over his chair in front of our table. the security staff was helpful to let us in and out while they tended to him. The buffet manager thanked us for being cooperative with the excitement but everyone in the vicinity should of got a free buffet coupon for dealing with that. They did clean it up quickly I might add. All in all visit boulder or sunset or gvr. Even palace station I would say has a better buffet. Step your game up Red Rock. Bring your players card its only 13.99 ."}
{"text":"This Buffet was Delicious. I liked the Brisket at the BBQ Station, it was fresh and moist. They kept our drinks refilled which is my usual complaint at Buffets. We went at Noon and people were in the Buffet but it wasnt overly crowded. All the stations were kept stocked with food. I wish they had Ambrosia and for the Bread Pudding, Warm Vanilla sauce that some other Feast Buffets have would of been nice to put on top. Which is why they only got 4 stars."}
{"text":"Pls don't even try to compare this buffet w/ any strip casino buffets...their is no way you should compare them. This is a local casino feeding the local masses and an occasional way word tuorist...Given the local masess arn't much on haute cusine. So this is just basic food for a very low price. Best value is breakfast $4.00 w/ boarding pass..Lunch/Dinner is passable. Nice thing is you get all your courses to choose from. For $7.99 you can't beat it...If you wanted salad, burger, drink gonna cost you more at McDee's and no seconds/refills...enjoy.."}
{"text":"**Summary**        - Quality - Nothing was cooked, everything tasted nice, and the service was excellent.        - Value - If you go in Mon - Sat at 3:30pm, you're essentially paying lunch price for a dinner buffet. **Price**        - $4.99 Breakfast 8am-11am Mon - Sat        - $6.99 Lunch 11am-4pm Mon - Sat        - $9.99 Dinner 4pm-9pm Sun - Thurs, 4pm-10pm Fri & Sat        - $9.99 Brunch 8am-4pm Sun **Available**        - BBQ Beef Ribs - Friday and Saturday nights, they have BBQ Beef Ribs on the BBQ carving station. Decently meaty and pretty great for the price. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/djAWtGq2IxKaxMIMw-P58A?select=PF1DKVOMCtrbFMAS-E-_GQ)        - Sea Bass - Their sea bass is moist and flaky.        - Roast Beef - They didn't have prime rib, but it was tender on the inside.        - Ham - Giant ham that wasn't too salty and was cooked right.        - Everything else is just normal things you find at a buffet. **Recommendations**        - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap buffet. Save the ribs, nothing particularly stands out. However, given the price, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Where do I begin.  Bread, danish, rolls all old/stale.  Chicken cooked with bad oil.  Everything was of poor quality.  Ranch dressing was watery, sausage was rubbery, bacon tasted like it had been boiled, not fried.  Roast beef was dried out.  My wife and I left so disappointed.  Don't say someone didn't tell you so.  This place has been let go."}
{"text":"I give the Buffet 4 stars.  They were very accommodating to my family of 12.  Just coming from a funeral it was pretty draining for me and wasn't feeling all to well.   My 1st trip was to the salad bar very small limited choices but I got in my greens.  The southwestern black bean salad was the highlight.  Then I went down the food line from Asian, Chinese, skipped over the build your own pasta station, a highlight of the place by the people waiting in line.  Then there was Italian, American, southern and of course Mexican, lots to choose from so variety was good on this day.    I'm not that big of a fan of buffets anymore since 90% I'm eating healthier meals.  The healthier I eat the mire salt and sugar I notice, this place is high in salting there foods and more variety in fats.  I guess it's was tourist and Vegas people want.  $9.99 is not a bad price but you got to eat at least $9.99 or more to get you value so make sure you have an appetite"}
{"text":"I love most of the Station Casinos Buffets.  The GVR has the best korean ribs made to order.  I love this buffet it's a little small but the food is great."}
{"text":"It's a cheap buffet at $10 but the food wasn't that good. There was no beef dish at all, I went for lunch and even the carving station was just sausage, turkey and ham. Only place that had a beef dish was the Mongolian BBQ section but the stir fry was ground beef yuck. Best part of the meal was the hand scooped ice cream that's it. It was only $10 so couldn't expect a great buffet, would I eat there again only if I was desperate and wanted something quick.  Refills on drinks was slow I had to ask every time to get a refill."}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday brunch and was expecting a decent spread with prime rib and all but really top round beef is what they served at the carving station that sucked. Bottomless mimosas if your a drinker. The only thing that was good was general tsao chicken in the Asian section. Thy had the typical fair bacon eggs omelet station. I wasn't gonna get an omelet that would have filled up. The sushi section looked like shit, but my rule is never eat sushi at a buffet they pre make it and bring it out of the fridge yuck. I paid over $16 for a lousy brunch. But in all due respects it's fairly cheap compared to a strip casino and for the price I guess it's decent if you want to load up in breakfast food   Oh I forgot the gelato was decent."}
{"text":"The buffet was okay they do have a pasta station and a stir fry station. This is for the dinner buffet. I mainly enjoyed the Chinese BBQ pork that was the highlight of the meal to me. The roast beef was dry and didn't look good. The fried cod was on point. I did try the stir fry it was pretty decent. The desert section was decent I enjoyed the gelato. The buffet was comped but their prices are really cheap regardless."}
{"text":"My friends came to visit from San Jose and treated me with some comps to Aliante casino's buffet. Not sure what the prices were so I can't comment on that; however, the food was better than I expected. Different options, as they were serving breakfast and lunch items. Clean and fresh food. I was happy with my experience."}
{"text":"As a local and a card member for the station casinos, I would get coupons to the buffet -- Buy one get one free! So why not go here?   Brad T. and I would usually go here during lunch time since the price for the lunch buffet is $8.99 or $10.99? The service is quick and the place is clean.  The food is good and feels me up.  Here are one my favorite choices: -Salad bar -Pasta -Garlic bread -Mashed potatoes -& their asian station. -oh & ice-cream - it's not the best ice-cream in the world, but who doesnt love ice-creams?!  Overall, I would recommend this buffet it is a pretty solid buffet."}
{"text":"Worst buffett. Everything was not cooked proper. Paid 70 dlls for brunch and Man I over paid. Then noticed Chinese food that looked really good, and had this nice plates. Wow I was wrong. Rice was so hard I couldn't eat it. The fruit was the only thing that was good. But not worth 70 dlls."}
{"text":"Feast buffet finally has a new head chef! I've genuinely enjoyed my last two visits. The food tastes better than it did in 2014. Thank you, Red Rock!"}
{"text":"I almost gave it 3 stars just so I could use the word \"meh\" in my review.  We went for a work luncheon.  I don't know how sitting at really long tables and periodically getting up for food was supposed to bond us as a staff, but, hey, I'm a \"go along\" girl.  The food was mediocre to salty.  The desserts were easy to resist, which I appreciated.  We had a rather large group and really should have had at least one server assigned to us. We did not. Maybe, the group is known for being bad tippers.  I didn't go last year, so this may be the reason. However, when the best thing about a buffet are the beverages, you should get asked if you want any more beverages. it wasn't awful and in the spirit of \"going along\", I would go again, but I would rather not."}
{"text":"I arrived for dinner at 6pm after a long drive from Phoenix. I was told to get the rewards card for a discount at the buffet. My meal was $16 after 15% tip and the discount.  There were many stations to choose from and I obviously couldn't have tried everything, but I did try some after very big salad which was about as average as I have ever had, but that was my fault. I always make the same salad.  I settled on street tacos, orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, fries. The street tacos were chewy as if they had been sitting in the back for hours. The orange chicken was more breading than chicken and nearly flavorless as was the teriyaki chicken. The fries were old and chewy like the street tacos. The best part of meal was the vanilla bean gelato. The only part I didn't like about that was that i ate all that stuff I didn't like and didn't leave enough room for the gelato.   My waiter was attentive, although he did clear my table while I was getting another round of dessert. There were some staff that had the look of misery on their face. Could have been close to the end of the shift."}
{"text":"Bring the feed bag, this buffet is HUGE!  Friday night has seafood and Saturday is Prime Rib night and both nights are awesome!  If the everyday breakfast buffet is good and best part of the buffet is join the Station's players card club and get discounts every month!  The over all Buffet experience is really good, they have over 50 items to pick from and the food is fresh and taste good....  Best time to go is at 10am because they start changing over from breakfast to lunch, so you get both breakfast and lunch items to choose from....."}
{"text":"Ate Sunday afternoon, it's all day brunch. Have to say reminded me of 20 years ago eating at circus circus buffet. That was my last time I've ever ate there and I'm feeling the same way here. Never again. Food was terrible with no selection of anything decent."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Vegas and my wife's second.  I had planned our itinerary so that we could visit the Henderson casinos on our first day prior to our check in at our strip casino.   Green Valley was really nice and the last stop on our tour of the Henderson casinos.  After playing slots for awhile we decided to have lunch at the Feast Buffet.  There was quite a line but it moved quickly. The buffet is very large and offers many options of food including Italian, Asian, and others.   I started with the Market Selection which is the salad bar. The food was very good but I felt it could have offered more in the way of toppings.   For main dishes I tried the carved roast turkey and the BBQ Chicken.   The turkey was fabulous and possibly the best I've had anywhere.   The chicken was cooked well but not overdone and the BBQ sauce was tangy and sweet.   Side dishes were all good.  For desert I had the Oreo Parfait. It has an awkward texture but taste good.  The Coconut Cream pie while looking somewhat plain was Extremely good every part of it was fabulously delicious.   I can't remember the waitresses names but our waitress got hung up in another section but another server took on our table with no complaints.  I wish I could remember her name because she was very very good.   Service oriented and very friendly.   We ate here and the the Feast at Red Rock but I will say the GVR Feast was the better of the two during our trip."}
{"text":"I went for Sunday dinner after visiting the Valley of Fire and was starving. The price is right at $13.99 with a free player's card (note you can't get the card at the buffet so it's $18.99 otherwise). There was a long wait to enter. I could see it wasn't more than half full but still had to wait nearly 30 minutes in line which was quite annoying.  This buffet has good selections of Asian, Mexican, Italian, and Southern food in addition to a decent salad bar and dessert area. The highlights were the roast beef and BBQ ribs. Both were flavorful without being dry and were very fresh. The Asian section was okay and the shrimp n' grits and succotash were worth trying in the southern section. Save a little dessert space as they have a selection of pies and will cut you a slice. I really enjoyed the coconut creme pie.  If I come out to this section of Vegas next trip I'll visit this buffet again so y'all save me some ribs."}
{"text":"I've eaten here too many times to mention, but don't let that fool you. Since it is the closest buffet to my house and I get monthly bogo coupons, makes me a regular. The breakfast is usually my choice time to go since they discontinued the seafood night. The food is hit or miss. My faves for dinner are the BBQ pork spareribs, egg rolls and eggplant dish in the Chinese section. The prime rib is usually tasty, however they almost always only have one selection of doneness and it's usually well done. My faves for breakfast are the eggs Benedict, made to order omelets and the lox. The only dessert that is worth trying is the gelatto. The cappuccino flavor is delicious. The service can be hit or miss as well. Sometimes you'll have a super friendly attentive server and sometimes they could care less about you."}
{"text":"Mother's Day 5/12/2013 We decided to dine at the palace station after we got out of church, it would be our 1st time eating here!! We'll the 8 of us, in which one was pregnant & a 16 month old baby goes in have dinner, that night my daughter gets sick, then i wake up to find my son & husband also sick, All food poisoned  they had in common the Tacos i started to have one but i changed my mind, glad of that!! Needless to say we will never eat here again!! It was our 1st & last time eating here!! I am pretty sure more people got sick i just hope they had sense enough to call and let the casino know about it as i did, They don't even deserve 1 star to tell you the truth! I just want to warn people please, please be careful when eating here!! food poison is no joke and can be serious!! What a way to mess up my mother's day by making my family ill...STAY AWAY FROM THE BUFFET..or eat at your own risk...GOD please bless the food they serve here and protect those who decide to eat here!! Amen"}
{"text":"The only star is for my server who was friendly, cleared plates quickly and was always in top of refills. The food however.....bland, COLD, and dry!!! Ive been to some bad buffets but this is one of the worst! Nothing here was worth a second taste. Salad bar was abysmal. Hardly a selection and are those canned diced tomatoes in a salad bar?! Wtf. Once I fought my way through the entree sections, dessert was the real low point. I cant even pick what I want. I have to wait for someone to get it for me. Then when the plaatic (glass?) cover breaks and falls onto the pie slices the lady doesn't even remove the ones that got smashed! Yes I would like a piece of that chocolate mousse pie but um, no, not the one that's had dirty plastic on it! Da fuuk? Seriously. Dont come here. Money better spent in a machine!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that most station casino buffets are about the same and offer similar foods. I didn't go in thinking it was like bacchanal @ Caesars. I just wanted a good and cheap brunch buffet near home. On a Sunday afternoon for the brunch buffet, it came out to $14.99 per adult. For brunch they offer the basics but with certain breakfast foods. They have an Asian section, Italian, American, intercontinental (Hispanic food and breakfast food), salad bar and dessert.  The breakfast food was actually pretty good. The French toast and mini pancakes were hot and sweet. I also had some beef chili which I wouldn't recommend. It was very bland and oily. The Asian section had quite a bit of variety. They had pad Thai, BBQ char sui, mapo tofu, Singapore noodles, etc. Unfortunately it all tasted average and it wasn't very hot. Desserts were also the classics: carrot cake, apple pie, cookies, etc. I noticed most ppl got ice cream on a cone to go. One thing I liked the most was the atmosphere. It was clean and very open. Kind of unexpected from a casino so old. Tip: if you want even cheaper, go sign up for their rewards card and you can get Sunday brunch for $9.99 (other days are cheaper too). It doesn't hurt you to sign up either. It's just a rewards card that's meant to entice locals and gamblers."}
{"text":"ummmmm... it's a buffet inside a casino... do you need to read a review? oh ya, its cheap! ...and im talking about the quality of food!  but i will eat here regardless cause i dont give a shi* like that..."}
{"text":"This buffet is very diabetic friendly, The chef herself came to our table to tell us what the carbohydrate count was in the food my 4 year old son wanted. Then she told us that they would come and get the needle and put it in a disposal box for us when we were done injecting him. I've never had service like that anywhere! (7/15/16 9am)  The food was really good and the service was excellent. The station buffets always have good food."}
{"text":"Some of the food is dry, like the salmon I had this weekend at the lunch buffet.   The biggest problem we have with the buffet is they need a new manager to run it & properly staff & run it.  We waited in line about an hour for breakfast & there were empty tables all over, & most were not cleared by bus boys. They didn't have enough staff, & with only 2 cashiers working up front, they were set up at all levels to only serve about half the people who wanted to dine & this was a slow weekday.  You would think that when there are people who want to give you money, you could staff up & properly run the buffet.  When we finally got seated the woman who took us to her table stuck a piece of gum in her mouth as she walked us to our table & she had an attitude of \"I don't care\" as she told us our server would be there soon.  Our Mexican server (female) was very good though & helpful except they don't give you spoons unless you ask for them & everyone needs one for the ice cream, etc.   The ice cream is great, my favorite desert.    Waiting so long in line when we got there about 10:45 am is just crazy & not the way to run a business.   Since I like the food and it is cheap I am giving it another shot tomorrow morning, but earlier.  It opens at 8 am.    P.S. I like that when you order coffee they  bring a pot to the table for you."}
{"text":"We hadn't been to a Feast buffet in a while, so my husband surprised me when he said he wanted to try it.  Little did we know it would be an 1hr in line and the food was old.  It turns out that Wednesdays are senior days at all Stations casino's, so be weary if you are gonna go be sure it's worth your wait and then when you're done, expect to still be hungry!"}
{"text":"We've enjoyed the feast buffet before, but here lately, they all seem to be going down hill.  We thought why not give it another try, so after a 30 minute line wait, we got in.   The selection hasn't changed, the usual Chinese, Mexican, BBQ, Italian, salad and dessert sections.  Everything looked and smelled good.   Most tasted good, but it's just a plain buffet nothing \"special\" anymore!"}
{"text":"We still can find some quality food at this Stations buffet, it's not true of some of their other locations.  We come this way from time to time, it's on the other side of the valley, way north.  So it's  drive for us.  If we happen to be in the neighborhood and looking for food, we'll stop in.  The selection of food is the usual, salad bar, BBQ, Chinese, Mexican and Italian and of course there are the deserts.   Using your players card, you can save a little or even get a free meal if you have enough points."}
{"text":"Normally, my experience here is great, but I guess it has to do with the season and people and their children. I am very fortunate to not have any! Now, don't get me wrong, I love kids, babies, but when I go to the casino, I do not want to be around children; this is grown folks time! I have to throw the race card in here because people are always saying that certain race of children are so mannerable; HA! This Asian family with three children: ages looked to be 13, 8 and 5, boys and girl, respectively, these children were very unruly! The 8 year old would not listen to the father and kept punching the older boy. They got seated. I asked the hostess to please do not put us by any children; she said behave! I said I will try! The area where she put us, it seemed that there was only grown people, no kids! Why, Why did those children insist on every time they got food, they walked or ran through that area?!! I saw Latino children, white children and black children who were on their best behavior; I better not ever hear anyone say that Asian children are so well mannered! The 8 year old was throwing food. My sister asked me to not say anything to them. We told our waiter and he just shook his head and said that if they reprimand them, they get scolded! WOW!!! Okay...  When I go into the buffet, I want an adults only side where we can drink and eat in peace without baby crying and little Jimmy making farting noises, it's bad enough grandpa does it. This may sound wrong, but I truly feel that casinos should not allow children in at all! KidsQuest or Not!!!   No complaints about the food, just the ambiance! The staff were wonderful! It's just the people, society...it sucks, especially for us who chose not to have kids or pets. And that brings me to the Golden Corral...Lawd Have Mercy, I have alot to say today!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Quality, cleanliness, and food options need to improve drastically. Please help!"}
{"text":"We come here pretty frequently. We even held our brunch for 50 the morning after our wedding here. The value is there, especially if you have coupons. The service is usually good. The food is OK. If you don't have coupons, you get a discount with your Station card. They allow two people per card. Friday is seafood night $27.99 and Saturday is prime rib and shrimp night $17.99. Otherwise dinner is $14.99 with $9.99 and $7.99 for lunch and breakfast respectively.  I hit up the carving station, the pasta station (you can choose your pasta and sauce) when available, the Mongolian grill, and the dessert station. I usually don't touch the pizza, Mexican, or Asian stations.  Our last visit was on Easter Sunday and it actually was not that busy. They'll usually run special prices and selections on holidays. This year they offered prime rib and lamb on the carving station. And they opened a lamb gyro station. Price was $22. We waited five minutes at the most for our party of 8 around 6 PM, but this was definitely an exception. Expect a lengthy wait sometimes, especially on weekends and holidays.  We'll come here on weeknights when my wife or I aren't in the mood to cook for 5. If it was just my wife and I, or me and my buddies, I'd probably offer that we pay more, make the drive, and head to the Strip."}
{"text":"I went to visit some family at Red Rock Hotel and they treated us to the Feast Buffet. I was thinking it would just like the strip buffets but then realized it was in a local casino so I lowered my expectations. I hate here during lunch and is just like any other buffet you would find in any other off strip hotel except for the Buffet at M Resort which is way better in my opinion.   The food here is nothing exciting with your Asian, Mexican, American, Seafood, Italian and Dessert stations you'd find in most off strip buffets. What I liked was the price and you can save the rest for the casino or whatever. Service was great and our waitress was quick refill our drinks, buffet areas were clean and I liked the contemporary design."}
{"text":"Um so yeah, got a coupon for 2 for 1 buffet, didn't think much about it but my friend lives on the other side of town so we decided to meet at GVR [in the middle] for drinks/gambling/dinner. Suggested my coupon and he was down as he had eaten at this buffet for breakfast one time and said it was really good.   It blows the buffet at Red Rock out of the water.    It's smaller but has just enough food.  For the 2 of us it was like $16 [with the coupon] so like $8.00 each.  I had a make your own taco which had all the fixins and was delicious.  They had a whole carving station spread complete with turkey, ham, and beef. Baked potatoes, gratin potatoes, mashed potatoes, my stomach just growled thinking about it. My friend showed up with a Thanksgiving meal on his plate covered in gravy that just made me lol'd and smh!   Chinese food was good too not too salty just right, fried shrimp, salad bar, and a large selection of desserts that I steered clear of :)  Go it's good and it's reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Ok so not my favorite, I'm not a huge buffet girl in the first place but this one has numerous problems.  I went on a Sunday morning for their brunch which includes a complimentary mimosa [yum].  1) ordered coffee-got no spoons to stir it :( 2) they have sushi on the buffet at 9 am?  that's weird 3) they had a bowl of watermelon by the Asian sauces?  just seemed really out of place 4) Oxtail wasn't bad and the mini spinach quiche was good too-everything else was average or below average at best. Loaded mashed potatoes were pretty good too. 5) Pepper shrimp were way overcooked and dried out resembled beef jerky and they weren't peeled so you had to do that process 6) fried rice was the saltest thing I've ever tasted in my life 7) only one guy making omelets- needed more people. And sadly the omelet guy was right smack in the middle of one of the buffet rows. The Italian one to be exact?  Why there I have no idea makes no sense? AND the other issue was there was a line of like 10-15 people which backed up over all the Italian food [again had like a bunch of lunch or dinner items at 9 am in the morning????) Row went like this breakfast calzone, pancakes, pizza, omelet guy, Italian food. Pizza didn't look good either 8)  They had full salad bar out again, you betcha at 9 am [who eats salad at 9 am?]  They also had a full BBQ section out w/ like baby back ribs and fried chicken again it's 9 am? 9) for brunch I'd like to see more brunch things, eggs bennie, breakfast pizza, egg white and spinach something or egg whites in general.  Maybe some breakfast casseroles, chicken sausage, something.  There was just too much lunch at brunch and not enough breakfast options. Crab legs would've been nice too :)"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday dinner and price was $13.99 with players card. For that price everything was worth it here.  Buffet has ok sushi, meat selection like ribs, pork, chicken, Mexican food, Asian food, Italian food, and the usual salad bar.  Their creme brûlée and gelato was amazing. Come here for a cheap buffet out of the strip area near the Outlet"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO FOR BFAST! is a waste of money... food is terrible overpriced and service is mediocre. I will not make the mistake again.. I had lunch n dinner here a few months back and it was Ok"}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE! Wouldn't recommended this place, food is greasy and reheated. Manager Maria is rude and uses profanity in front of kids, very unprofessional."}
{"text":"We tried other buffets during our first time to Vegas and this is our favorite. The ribs are fall-off the bone good. This is the only place that knew how to make real homemade stuffing. All the American food was the best. The service is good also. They clean the tables too, not just clear and put placemats over the dirty surface; yes another place did that. We very highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Oh Lord, where do I start with this one?  I knew the experience was going to be bad when I was too late in recovering my comp card during the transaction.  I thought I had forgotten my card to give me a $2 discount, but after a quick check of the side pocket in my wallet, I realized that I had my card with me all along.    \"Oh, here it is\", I smiled at the cashier, handing her to the card.  She looked the height of annoyed at me and said \"I've already rung it up\", as she processed the last of my credit card.  Did she cancel the order?  Oh, heavens no!  That would take what, 2-3 button presses to adjust?  Don't want to tire out the fragile lamb.  Did I mention that there was no one behind me, so she would have had more than enough time to adjust my order?  It wasn't happening, and she let me know it.  The \"Feast\" is more like a \"Fe\".  It's small.  Surprisingly so.  I've been to small buffets, but the selection was really limited.  But it's the food that matters, right?  If you like fried chicken jerky masterfully placed on a chicken bone, and other freeze-dried foods, you'll feel like you're eating either the best camping or astronaut food around.  I walked around in hopes of finding some sort of culinary salvation, but the best I got was a bad stomach ache after the meal.  The desserts, however, weren't bad, and the dispenser iced tea was okay.  They did a fairly decent job of clearing the table.  And so chronicles the first and last time I'll eat there.  I might have endured the mummified food if not for the rude service."}
{"text":"My dear, darkly demented friend took me here after winning a two-fer whilst cashing her check (apaprently screaming \"Food\" will get it to land on the buffet) adn so we starved ourselves all morning to prepare for a feast/competion of who could be the fattiest fatty (I won!).  For a Vegatarian there wasn't much to gawk at aside from the giant cold pasta and salad bar in the very center of the room- think they are trying to push the veggies a bit a by having it very accessible to everyone? They have the usual suspects of American (mashed potatoes and fried chicken) Asian (Chow Mein and Orange Chicken) BBQ (self-explanatory) and Italian (Pizza and hot Pasta). My dishes were mainly composed of potatoes, since they seriously had three different types, a very bland cheesy pasta (it did NOT taste like cheese) vegetable spring rolls w/ sweet and sour sauce, some cheese pizza, some bread, and by far the worst thing ever- salt and pepper fried tofu. I've had many kinds of fried tofu. I have never had fried tofu that was as bad as this. It was tough. It was dry. It was tasteless. It was sad. We broke open every one of them on my plate, and they were all the same: dead on the inside.  Finally we left behind our two diet Pepsis and ran over to the dessert area where we filled plates full of pastries. The best one had to be the mini eclairs. Though they were a little on the dry side, they were far more palatable than the soggy cannolis, and nasty tiramisu (seriously, it didn't taste anything like tiramisu, or a dessert). They have fruit and cream pies, but they taste pretty much like they are: out of a can. The best dessert by far is the ice cream. Though, you have to wait for ten minutes for an employee to waddle over and ask if they can give you a scoop since it is protected by glass. Best way to get their attention? Glare at them from the ice cream. They'll stare back as if waiting for you to get annoyed and go back to your seat without it. But no! Not us! For a cheap meal when you feel like eating a lot, it is an alright place."}
{"text":"We stayed at Sunset Station recently and ate at the 'Feast Buffet' three times. Brunch, Breakfast/lunch and dinner. I also noted all of the mixed reviews, so I will fill you in on my experience. I'm not comparing the 'Feast' to the way it used to be, nor to other 'Station' casino buffets, other buffets in Henderson, or to the Las Vegas Strip high end buffets.   We had three very enjoyable meals here in the beautiful dining room, enjoyed the food and the warm friendly staff. By staying at the resort we were able to stay up late, sleep in, roll out of bed and eat at our leisure. That in itself is worth partial points.   Location: Inside the Sunset Station Hotel and Casino Resort in northern Henderson not too far from the Las Vegas airport. If you go east from the airport on Sunset or Warm Springs Rd. about 7 miles and you can't miss it.  Venue: Large beautifully appointed dining space.  Prices: The Station Casino Group has the \"Boarding Pass,\"  a player card just like all the other casinos. If you sign up for the card you can get a discount on the already low cost buffet. If you are a high roller you get an even bigger discount and wait in a shorter line. Anyway breakfast $7.99, lunch $9.99 dinner $11.99...but +$1 if you are the basic level Boarding Pass. A bit higher if you choose not to sign up. There are 2 for 1 discounts floating around and Military Monday... It was a bit confusing but for me it is a good value and I have no reason to complain at all. Brunch on Sunday at $15.99 full price or about $11.99 discounted is about the same as dinner.  Breakfast: Omelet Station, hot oatmeal, bacon, bagels, seasoned potatos, donuts, sausage, etc.etc.  Biscuits and gravy, collard greens, black eyed beans. Mexican items like Spanish rice and beans, salsa, and more. Pizza, pasta, vegetables. Salad Bar with Soups and a dessert bar. All good quality with nice presentation.  Salad Bar: Available at all times. Yes I agree, even though all the basics are there with nice presentation and quality, this is the weakest link at the buffet. But, I also noticed that few diners here are health conscious and they go for the MEAT, Sausage, Fried Chicken, Ham and so on. If you are looking for a world class salad bar experience you will be disappointed. I did eat a nice healthful spinach salad at all three of our meals but I was alone at the salad bar each time.   Brunch Lunch: We did attend the very popular Sunday Brunch. Long Lines with lots of local families out for a family feast. Omelet Station, Asian stir fry station, Mexican, American and Italian and Gelato dessert bar. Mimosas are included with brunch.  Cross Over Dining: I'm not sure if this is the exact term but some pro level buffet diners time their dining by entering the cheaper breakfast or lunch time slots and stay over until the lunch or dinner buffet stations open up...thus getting the best of both...at the lower price. Here at the Feast this is allowed or at least there is no effort made to prevent this.  Dinner: Pretty much the same items, but, wine, beer, frozen drinks are extra. Cooked to order burgers and hot dogs. Carved ham, pork, thick sausage, and turkey breast.  Desserts: Not world class, but far from being an afterthought, the Gelato and Bread Pudding and Carrot Cake kept me satisfied at the price point.  Vegetarian: This review is focused for the meat eating patrons. Although, interestingly, while there are many vegan/vegetarian restaurants in the Henderson area, that trend has not yet surfaced at the Feast Buffet. I was able to find a few meat free items. So I was happy enough.  Service: These guys are pros and accustomed to working in a high volume setting. The waiters and host staff were all among the best I have ever encountered. I was very appreciative and felt good tipping them well.   Is this the best buffet I've ever gone to? Nope, but is was good enough for times that we didn't want to leave the hotel.   Summary: Nice, yet, sadly ignored small salad bar. No all you can eat crab legs or lobster or sushi. No 'thick as a book' slices of prime rib. No 100 varieties of artistic desserts made in house. However, not a single item was poorly prepared or had a shabby presentation. The warm and efficient staff added to the experience. Those facts combined with a good value price made me a fan!"}
{"text":"It's a big buffet with lots of choices but the food is okay. I guess most buffets don't pay attention to the details but they should. For the price tag you would hope it would have more options. The good is that it's clean and well organized. It's also not too busy which is a big plus because most buffets are always crowded.  The salad bar is my favorite because it has a lot of toppings to choose from."}
{"text":"Definitely a well-worth budget buffet! The food was decent, and you'll definitely get the bang for your buck.   My favorite was the dessert bar - self-serve icecream &a assortment of cakes and pies!!   Unfortunately can't compare to Wicked Spoon @ Cosmopolitan, but this was 1/3 the price so I'm happy with that!!"}
{"text":"We went the buffet on a Friday night around 7pm. It was seafood night so there was a line out the door. But it didn't take too long to get us seated. They claimed they were running low on seafood but according to all the shrimp, sushi, and other items my husband had on his plate they had enough haha.  Decent selection for only being 17.99. Had a pasta station and excellent prime rib. It's off the strip but this will now be our go to buffet for price and quality wise."}
{"text":"Good at breakfast ok..,but can't beat after tax $7.00 breakfast even if it's just FRESH FRUIT and COFFEE it's still cheaper than the market. Today was my binge eat cheat day...Rebecca was my server and was so attentive she seen my Tabasco was low and took the seal off and set me a brand new one!  GREAT SERVICE!  Nice quite...read my book..killed time till I could go to Dr appointment!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for the price. Make sure you sign up for their rewards card so you can get $5.00 off. The food is very diverse and high quality. I would highly recommend this place to anyone willing to try the traditional food from the \"Strip\"."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Sunday Brunch. They need a bigger breakfast selection. Omelete bar was delicious."}
{"text":"Haven't been to all the Station Casinos yet but Feast Buffet is one of the best Ive eaten at and yet left with empty feeling. The food here was some best I've had since I've been in Vegas but the service was SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW. I usually go around lunch time and no matter when I get there it seems to take a while to get seated and drinks, forgetaboutit. needless to say for $8.64 and free if you get enough points it's not bad"}
{"text":"Really, I'm very much over the Las Vegas buffet. After almost five years in this town you start to realize that 95% of the food at 95% of the buffets is pretty much interchangeable. And most of it isn't all that good, especially when you're paying full price. So I'm going to be a tough grader when it comes to buffets.  Fortunately, the Station Feasts are discounting all month so Sunday brunch was $11.95, an acceptable price to pay.  The food was OK - better than average for a buffet, fairly fresh but generally unremarkable for better or for worse. Decent variety, with nice touches including roasted jalapeno peppers on the Mexican station, a really good pesto pasta salad, smoked salmon and bagels, and kielbasa. The hand-sliced prime rib was decent, although I had to ask twice to get the size and cut that I wanted. Station also does desserts really well. You can't go wrong with any of them.  Two things of note about this visit.  1) Station loses a star for the decision to limit guests to two glasses of cheap swilly \"champagne\" at brunch. What the hell? When I first moved to town, getting half in the bag on barely drinkable sparkling wine was half the fun of getting up on a Sunday morning. I'm sure the bean counters were on their butts about the amount of free champagne they were pouring, but come on! The stuff is dirt cheap and since when are casinos stingy about getting their guests drunk?  2) The friendliness and customer focus of my server gets that star back. She always had a smile, was quick to bring me fresh silverware (without asking) or top off my drinks. She even brought me a third glass of champagne in spite of Station's dumb new brunch policy. I've always thought that even though buffet servers are probably among the most underappreciated of industry workers, the ones you find at Station's Feast buffets across the city tend to be very pleasant and friendly, so much so that you wonder why they're not working for a real restaurant. This was no exception.  Slightly above average food, well above average service, tainted by obvious parsimony that probably manifests itself behind the scenes in ways that give me pause about ingredient quality, etc."}
{"text":"This is a good buffet for locals on a Saturday who don't want a more expensive Stations brunch buffet. There were many options for healthy eating, including moist sliced roast turkey and salad with all the fixings. Chicken was sparse for some reason. Lots of veggie choices including Chinese stir fry and green beans. Two for one coupon makes this a great deal. The casino is a bit smokey unfortunately."}
{"text":"As locals, we eat breakfast or lunch here once a week but just getting to a review. The service is excellent but the food can be inconsistent. If one wants to eat healthy, there are choices. For breakfast they have a turkey hash with cubed turkey and potatoes in a broth. I also like the cubed fruit salad and grapefruit slices. If the line is short, omelettes are a good choice to control what you eat. You can ask for egg whites. For lunch, the turkey is usually moist, the sweet potato is flavorful. But I wish they would cut the potatoes in half as the portions are enormous. The Asian section is consistently good; in fact better than most take outs in this town. My niece likes the hot and sour soup because it is not pork based. There are many vegan choices available throughout the day. I like the roasted veggies but wonder what oil is used. The broccoli is usually good but occasionally overcooked. The salad bar has red sliced beets. I try to avoid bread, but the crusty bread is so good and better than most Italian restaurants. For dessert, I usually have chocolate gelato. For diabetics, there are sugar free options. For gluten free options, look online or ask, but it is not readily posted."}
{"text":"We have been going to GVR for about 10 years now. We have always enjoyed The Feast at GVR. They used to be the only ones who had menudo and grilled eggplant as a regular feature. Sadly, the eggplant is no longer there, but the menudo is still around. We used to spread our trips around to the other Feasts, but lately, Sunset and Red Rock have not been up to par. We tried GVR to see if they were still great (and we had 2 comped buffets). We were not disappointed. The food was great, the service top notch and selection outstanding. The only reason I go with 4 instead of 5 starts is the missing eggplant and the small selection of grilled or steamed veggies...I usually go for the meat and potatoes type things, but the missus loves vegetables.  GVR has still got a handle on how to do a Feast Buffet right!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best Choice of buffets in Las Vegas  off Strip.  Food fresh and hot and beautiful decor and clean facilities.  Line can be long - but since I was VIP not a problem for me ( he he  - how much did that cost me?)   In any case if youre near Summerlin please try this Buffet."}
{"text":"4 stars for the great job they did with the food. Everything was nicely seasoned- not bland like some casinos' food as they try not to offend some palates. It would've been a 5-star experience if not for the hours-long line and additional long waits at the carving stations.  I think they should've had the carving stations set up separately from the other foods - although I think that wouldn't be possible given that they will grill meats upon request and therefore must be by the grills). But long lines at the carving stations did slow access to much of the Thanksgiving goodies.   Amongst us we had lamb (very strong tasting. My partner didn't like that it was so pale and tender), steak, turkey, bbq chicken and fried chicken. Also, green beans (slightly crisp and not overlooked at all), broccoli (same thing), au gratin potatoes, deliciously garlicky cheese bread,  mashed potatoes and stuffing (both very good!) with gravy, cranberry sauce and a few other things. I noticed the International stations were practically empty as we all stormed the Thanksgiving  area.   Anyway, I think if I came here again I'd prefer to be a VIP so I wouldn't have to wait for two hours to eat, but it was damn good food."}
{"text":"We are in town overnight and decided to eat at the Feast Buffet at Boulder station. It's was a great meal. We have been to much more expensive buffets on the strip which were no where near the quality of the Feast Buffet. The service was the best part. Our server was on point. We never wanted for anything. I highly recommend the Feast Buffet."}
{"text":"Yup, yup, works for us!  We end up hitting this place once a month on a Saturday for breakfast.  $5 per person with my 3 year old free.  Can not be beat!  Husband wanted to me try a new place ( he has a passion for buffets that can only be atributed to the fact that he did not grow up here) and wants to eat his way through the town.  The other buffet was more expensive and not that much better.  For the price, this place is better than IHOP, Marie Callander's, or Mimi's for breakfast.  Four people for $15, crazy!  Also, they don't care if my 7 year old runs around a bit, as he samples different things!"}
{"text":"Been here for Weekday Breakfast buf. Saturday Dinner Buffet. $7 ish Breakfast. $17 ish Tender, Tender, Tender Prime Rib Buffet. Exquisitely Seasoned. Wow. SO YUM. Much better than Lawrys by the Strip. My own 4 slices Prime Rib stacked would be near 4 inches."}
{"text":"Vegas is well known for buffets!  Feed the herd to give them enough energy to push the buttons on those slots!!  Woo hoo!  This moo moo got fed and won $100 on a penny machine!  Now, THAT is luck!  And so was this buffet that my parents and kids enjoyed.  It was so huge it felt like Epcot Center with different ethnic food presentations.  There was a dedicated section for sushi, mexican, chinese, italian, western american, and nice slices of beef and whole baked chickens.  My favorite was the shredded bar-b-que, green beans and tamale!!  The dessert section was standard but delicious!  There was a nice selection of unique and traditional gelato flavors from mango sherbet to strawberry.  The food was flavorful unlike so many buffets that taste like they made mashed potatoes from a box.  No, this place is worth having a meal.  It's about $10/person for lunch which includes unlimited choice of non-alcoholic beverages.  Three stars for the fact that: 1) My kids ate well 2) The atmosphere was nice 3)  And I ate well!!  Enjoy!  http://www.redrocklasvegas.com/dining/feast_buffet.php"}
{"text":"I only go to this (or any other buffet) when I get half off. Then again, I'm looking for work right now so I'm kind of cheap!  Anyway, for a buffet at it's price range I think it's pretty good, though Red Rock's is better (but costs a bit more). The salad bar offerings have always looked and tasted pretty fresh. Most of the other buffet items range from pretty good to pretty unexciting. I rarely eat dessert but the gelato and cobbler was good. I'm not sure about the cake - I'm not a cake guy...  Not great food, but that shouldn't be expected for the price, but the options allow for a much more nutritious varied meal than the food court, and/or certainly more quantity if you're in the mood for that!"}
{"text":"It's a great buffet. They have quite a variety of foods. I specially like the salad bar. The card for the price of the buffet is worth it. You just give em an i.d. they take your name down correctly and you get a discount. Sometimes they'll send you promos.   They have good shrimp and sushi, I love it wth cocktail sauce. I also like the Chinese food but the orange chicken is over cooked. I come here all the time and its always like that. The inside will be very dry almost hard. Aside from that i have no problem with the food here. There's certain things you can tell they don't put any thought or effort into. They could use some lasagna for Italian place or calzones.   The deserts part is filled with cookies and cake, pies, gelato and ice creams. All great choices. I like the chocolate creme pie. I hadn't had one in so long i too picture of it. There's also blueberry pie, i believe. You have to ask for these to be served or they are right in the back.   For breakfast here is really delicious. It's average but its a very nice meal. They have all the works as well. I love the creme rolls kind of like a crepe but they're rolls. That with strawberry sauce is yummy.  Unlike ALL buffets I've been too, I can definitely tell this is one of the more cleaner ones. I mean superbly clean. I don't see any inconsistencies. It looks very good and sanitized. That's why I give it a 5 star. I really appreciate this place for that.  I wouldn't come for the prime rib and shrimp night. Its a bit pricier and almost the exact same food. Except for prime rib. So..."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. Honestly I don't think I've been to a cheaper buffet let alone a casino buffet! $7.54 after tax for breakfast if you have a station casino card. Best breakfast in the casino imo. The servers are great. There's a selection of pastries including a variety of donuts, but I behaved myself and stayed away.  There is oatmeal, grits, and cream of wheat. French toast, pancakes, and waffles. If you want tacos for breakfast they have that option too. Plenty of fruit for those who are trying to be healthy. They have bagels and a couple different cream cheese options but I did not see lox. Some of my favorite items were the breakfast pizza (tho they had regular pizza too) the hash browns and the mini chocolate chip waffles. Those were nice and crisp on the outside but soft and delicious on the inside. Coffee is decent and you get your own pot. Several juice options; I got apple."}
{"text":"This place is poorly manager. Went there today with my family and one of the greeters Ravynn was very rude and rolled her eyes when she didn't think anyone was looking at her. Basically my family of twelve paid separately. She took the ticket and didn't even ask anyone anything and only half of the family was there so when she came back with 12 people waiting to be seated together she was surprised but again she just took the ticket and ran off. After she rolled her eyes we politely explained that we paid separately and didn't get the chance to tell Ravynn that we wanted to all sit next to each other and that coworker gladly accommodated us. The only reason I was frustrated because Ravynn was laughing at us. So we requested to speak to a supervisor Alec who was obviously no help. When we tried to explain the situation instead of apologize for his rude employees behavior he decided we needed a lesson in her employment history. Long story short he was incompetent. A greeter Riz was more than helpful and the cashier ladies in the front were great as well. Also I don't think Alec knew it was a supervisors job to handle customer complaints  sent an email to corporate hopefully I'll get a more useful response."}
{"text":"They didn't have much selection in the sushi area. Our waiter didn't fill our drinks until toward the end of our dinner, but he filled the table next to us more than once. I was not to happy about that. The prime rib was so hard. I kept watching my family cut the meat for days. That's how I noticed the meat was not chewable."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best cheap buffet I've been to in Vegas.  Cheap meaning $10 for lunch.  If I was a local w/ 2 teenage kids that eat til there's no 2moro..this would be the place to take them."}
{"text":"One of the better Station Buffets.  They have additional items that the others don't usually have. Personally, I enjoyed their salad selections including Faro and Squash salad, pretty tasty and a nice alternative to the usual green salad.    The carving station offers multiple options to choose from including sausage, turkey breast, and ham. Also have numerous sauces and other items such as caramelized onions with which you can top your carved selection.  Sadly, the sushi section is pretty poor, no shrimp, and wouldn't think about eating any of their rolls. At least have shrimp.   My other beef is the dessert section is pretty minimal with only the basics such as pie, ice cream, cookies and the like.  Have always found the servers to be helpful and friendly.  Wouldn't make a special trip to come here but when in the neighborhood and with a half off coupon, I'm game."}
{"text":"This buffet has gone from a very good dinner at an exelent price to: soggy salad, salty pasta and rubbery prime rib, the desserts are still at the same great taste though. Vegas is supposed to be known by it's cuisine, but lately it has been found overpriced and wanting."}
{"text":"We are staying at the Sunset Hotel & Casino because it's the closest hotel to family so decided to just go to the buffet for Thanksgiving dinner to avoid the traffic we could see from the room. I can't say I was looking forward to the buffet but some YELP reviews were really good but others said it was bad.   The line was long at 1 and we got in to eat at about 1:40. We were given a nice table close to the salad bar. I went to the salad bar and got a cup of chicken noodle soup while the others stood in the line for the carving station. The soup was surprisingly good. It tasted like homemade with bow tie pasta. I was finished with the soup by the time the others made it back with their turkey and prime rib.   The prime rib was very tender and flavorful. I got up to the carving station at the time they ran out of prime rib and turkey. I had to wait but they brought out 2 new whole turkey breasts and a whole rib roast. The first piece I got was very fatty because it was at the end so I waited for a few people to go because the ends were too fatty and well done. My husband went back for more (medium rare) and said it was more tender and flavor than the one he had at Lawry's.   There is an American, International, Italian and Asian foods section. The fried chicken was ok-crispy skin but kinda dry. The sides were mostly over cooked veggies, so-so potatoes but the collard greens and Brussels sprouts with butternut squash were tasty.   My favorites were the chicken noodle soup, watermelon-best and freshest dessert. And I had an cappuccino and stracciatella (a gelato variety with chocolate flakes, inspired by the soup) cone that was very good.   I would actually go back because it's so easy to not go out. The price is decent and if you chose careful, you can get some tasty food."}
{"text":"Green Valley Ranch used to be my favorite buffet in the early 2000's, and really used to pull out all the stops as far as quality in comparison to the other station casino buffets.  I assume it has been because they were bankrupt once, but this casino buffet was so bad when I came on a Friday night that it made Sunset Station, which I normally do not like, look like going to Joel Robuchon.  Gone are all the seafood (they used to be the only place in town that did dungeness crab along with snow crab), no prime rib, just some really tough roast beef.  Everything was just really badly cooked, and that is including the normally reliable steamed broccoli that one can usually get at a station casino buffet.  Priced under 10 bucks for dinner, this might be a good place to feed a huge family.  But the food was so bad, that money would be better spent going to the grocery store and feeding your family good, wholesome food instead of the slop served here."}
{"text":"They let me use my Station Rewards points here so The Feast Buffet usually ends up being free. I've been coming here for years but I've noticed that, all of a sudden, the staff seem a lot nicer. New management maybe? Food consists of the usual suspects, meat station, International station, Italian pasta station and desserts. My favorites today consisted of barbecue chicken pizza, watermelon, Sugarfree brownie. Or should I say \" no extra sugar added\"."}
{"text":"The italian food was definitely the best try the meat balls yummm... Generic buffet food but definitely better than most by far and super cheap for only 10 bucks"}
{"text":"WOW!! I'm very particular food wise and this was by far the best lunch buffet that I've ever seen in my life....and it was only $8.99. Even the decor is nice! I don't know why some reviews were negative. If you couldn't be happy here then you're a stroke! Lol"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an affordable buffet and aren't too concern about the fancy pants food this is the place to go. I paid about $12 ($10 w/the players card) and definitely got what I paid for. I was very satisfied with my meal and my experience considering the price I paid.   The buffet/restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful comparable to the aesthetics of the casinos on the strip. But the food definitely does not compare. There is a smaller selection of food (American, Italian, Asian, and Mexican). The food itself is nothing too special. It's fairly average food, but again w/ the price you are paying you won't be disappointed.   It seemed like most people there were regulars and the waiters were really kind and greeting them by first name.   If you want a lot of food for an affordable price this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Visited the Feast buffet inside Red Rock Station Casino today for lunch.  I agree with other Yelpers that the three separate entry lines are confusing.  Had to clarify with the lady signing people up for the Boarding Pass which line I belonged in since I was not a hotel guest, handicapped, a Platinum or Chairman member.  The line situation aside, I had a great time!  From the cashier to the server and food, everything was great!  Even though I had to ask the cashier to add the unlimited beer/wine for me after I paid, she was very nice about it with no attitude whatsoever.   My server, Ryan, was prompt and friendly throughout my nearly 2 hour visit!  My drinks (iced tea and wine) were constantly refilled at my request and dirty plates were whisked away as soon as I pushed them to the opposite end of the table.  Ryan made sure my every need was attended to and that I was satisfied with my visit.  He even offered me coffee with dessert, which I declined.  The food here was pretty good for what I expect from a buffet.  Of course, Gordon Ramsay is not overseeing each dish, but the texture, temperature and taste of the items (salad bar and entree stations) is reasonable for the price.  I have visited many buffets since moving to Las Vegas 7 years ago.  This property provides an exceptional value at a reasonable price!  I especially appreciated the grilled vegetables and GF/Veg/Vegan section since I am vegetarian.  I'll be back again soon and I'll ask for my fabulous server, Ryan!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, for what you pay it's not really that bad of a buffet. What you pay for is what you get.  They have a variety of different food choices from different cultures.  I have never had a bad experience myself."}
{"text":"So already having an amazing experience but watched the room light up every time an employee I noticed by name badge as Steve. A true class act. The room would light up with every interaction, including with myself and my son Owen. I'm a usual patron of the fiesta Henderson but will be changing up my new go to as this joint, hands down!!oh and don't sleep on the french onion soup. Make sure to get cheese from the pizza maker over at the Italian station!"}
{"text":"Located about 15 minutes away from the strip in the Green Valley Casino. Decided to give this a try as everyone in our party was interested in something different for dinner.  Price is about 60% less than Buffet prices on the strip at Rio, Ceasars, Mandalay Bay, Wicked Spoon, etc.  I definitely am not into AYCE, but had loyalty points on my Rewards card, and the gang wanted to go.  I went Monday night, and there was a 30 min line...another reason I do not like buffets, but it was extremely busy in there.  There was a large assortment of food, asian, Mexican, American.  I did like their salad bar, and everything I got, was pretty good. I was impressed.  I got wonton soup, a bbq pork rib, mash potatoes, meatballs, fried shrimp, Cesar Salad and Korean ribs.  Alot if food not on the menu, must be a secret menu ad I found out from locals we were sitting with.  For example, the Mongolian station, also made Philly Cheesesteak Sandwiches.  I would eat here again."}
{"text":"I brought my mom and grandma to the champagne brunch this morning to change things up a bit (they have spent a good bit of time on the strip).  We were assisted and seated quickly. Our waitress was very sweet and brought our drinks prompty--the mimosas are delicious.   We have eaten a lot of breakfast over the last few days,  so I tried some of the Asian cuisine. Everything was fresh and hot. It was all tasty. The salad bar was fresh and the fruit was sweet and delicious.   The buffet area is easy to navigate and they have options for everyone. The staff is kind, the food is good,  and the price is very reasonable. Make sure you sign up for a casino rewards card before eating to save a few bucks!"}
{"text":"This is for the breakfast buffet only, which I had this summer.  Really people?  You're whining about a 5.99 buffet?  Some people are just tightwads that want something for nothing, are fat and gotta gorge themselves by tasting every damn thing the buffet offers then complain about one item, or chronically hating the world.  I had a mushroom and cheddar omelet, breakfast potatoes, sausage and fruit.  All fresh and good and only 5.99!  Sure I could've had another round, but why, I was full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Their wait staff, price of admission, omelet station, and salad bar are easily worth 4 stars, but unfortunately the rest of the food and the dudes working the food stations, warrant 3 stars tops.. Especially the Mongolian station. I've eaten here about a dozen times, taking advantage of the Mongolian station about half the time. Every time, I ask for extra teriyaki flavoring, yet the result is almost no taste or flavor. For being the most \"fresh\" part of the buffet, it should have the most flavor.  The rest of the pre-made food is average at best. Everything from the taco meat to Chinese food is mostly flavor-less or over/under cooked.  The good items:  -Omelet bar -Hot & Sour soup -Salad bar(REAL, hot bacon bits by baked potato area!) -Potstickers  *Come around 10:30-10:40am, so you can get the cheaper breakfast pricing and a fresh omelet from the omelet bar before lunch items are brought out!*"}
{"text":"My mom and I had brunch/lunch here recently and enjoyed it.  Luckily she has Chairman status so we can go to the VIP line.  The place was really busy but we did not wait too long for a table after paying.  Because it was Sunday brunch, it was a mix of breakfast and lunch foods.  I tried quite a few different items.  Honey walnut shrimp (tasty but no walnuts), egg roll (yum), bacon (super crispy and tasty), Hawaiian pizza (decent flavor), the salad bar (love all the veggies options) and probably a few other things.  I also had the vanilla frozen yogurt (my favorite with rainbow sprinkles and nuts) and carrot cake (not very carrot cake like but had a good vanilla flavor).    So overall a good meal especially when you don't have to pay (mom had a food coupon).  You don't feel like you need to stuff yourself when its free."}
{"text":"Had never been to the GVR before, but heard it had a good breakfast buffet. I went not expecting all that much, but it really delivered. It doesn't offer any high end options for breakfast, but for $8.50 it really hit the spot. The place is nice and clean, and for the money the food was really good. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I visited for dinner.  The service was excellent but the food was only so-so.  Pizza was excellent, and so was the sesame chicken but some of the other choices lacked quality or flavor.  There were cheese enchilada's that I swear were filled with nacho cheese sauce.   Salad bar was lacking in fresh toppings, and consisted mostly of canned beans and crunch bits.  The buffet at Red Rock, though similar, was much nicer and had a bigger selection of food choices."}
{"text":"I haven't been to many casino buffets in Vegas but this was one just in the okay spectrum. It's super cheap if you have a players card, which is free so why not, right? About 11 dollars a person. If you don't have a players card it's about 14-15.   The variety of food is good. They have different stuff from diffent parts of the world like a majority of places out here. The night my husband and I went, however half of the food looked like it had been sitting out for quite some time, un stirred. They have a make your own stir fry section which was awesome but their dessert selection was kind of lacking. This doesn't really bug me since I'm not a dessert fan.  Overall: It had a variety of food but it's presentation left something to be desired. It's service was typical buffet, and the food wasn't \"amazing.\" It is, however cheap to eat at with a players card. Probably won't go back but okay to try once."}
{"text":"UPDATE: This place now charges $5 a lb. for the seafood, so no more all you can eat crabs! That really stinks, huh? So the buffet is set for about $16 for dinner, and you are given poker chips to pay for the seafood....POOOOOO!  My friends, family and boyfriend love this place! Crab legs for dinner, but not just any crabs! They can be cooked with a mix of butter, garlic, jalapeno peppers, and a bunch of other great seasonings and spices to add a unique flavor to those fresh crab legs. The fresh crab legs need to be opened with those crackers, but if you eat crab a lot, I'm pretty sure you know how to properly break those crab legs! This buffet actually marks the crab legs where you should break it, so that it makes it easier for you to eat with your hands! You can also get your shrimp sauteed with those ingredients too. The shrimp is usually fresh there, but I have seen some nights where they put the shrimp in the salad bar section (which sometimes looks as if the shrimp has been there for a whie). They have many types of food here, including Asian, Mexican, and Italian. I personally like their pizza here and their various types of pasta. If you're in the Asian section, you have to try their barbeque pork too! It is very tasty! My boyfriend loves the prime rib here. You can be the judge. It is rather tasty, juicy, and tender. Thinking of it makes me hungry.  This buffet also features a Mongolian type grill section, which is sort of nice when you want something made to your taste. I had just recently discovered from my friend, Theresa, that they also can cook Korean ribs there (only at brunch and dinner time of course!).   Also, don't miss out on the dessert section. They have a wide selection of Dreyer's ice cream like cookie dough, strawberry, cookies and cream, chocolate, vanilla, etc. You can even make milkshakes too!  Come to this buffet if you're in the Henderson area, especially after checking out this nice resort (You have to look at the pool area! Don't forget that the show Hell's Kitchen was filmed here for a couple of episodes, and the winner of this last year operates the Italian restaurant Terra Verde here too!).   For reference, here are the Buffet Prices and Hours:   Breakfast: Monday - Friday: 8am - 11:30am $7.99 per person or $6 .99 with BP Card   Brunch: Saturday & Sunday: 8am - 3:30pm $18 .99 per person or $16.99 with BP Card   Lunch: Monday - Friday: 11:30am - 3pm $10.99 per person or $9.99 with BP Card   Dinner: Monday - Sunday: 3:30pm - 10pm $18.99 per person or $16.99 with BP Card  BP card is the Boarding Pass card for the Station Casinos"}
{"text":"Relatives were visiting and rather than sit through another hour of them complaining about food and service,I hesitantly suggested a buffet. Why do people stand in line for 30-45 minutes for less than average food? It is NOT worth it. I will never, wait...NEVER do it again."}
{"text":"I expected more from one of the premium station casino locations.  Especially since they had a special Tuesday night $19.99 buffet instead of the usual $13.99.  I did like the multiple chef stations which included the usual carving station, a noodle station, and a pasta station.  Also, the salad bar had quite a few items including baby corn so I was happy with my salad.  On to the food.  Definitely disappointing.  The knishes were inedible, the potato pancakes nothing like a true latke and were severely undercooked. I hate the taste of raw potato.  The corned beef was actually pretty good although dried out a bit from the warming lamps.  The matzoh ball soup was dishwater with a grainy but fluffy matzoh ball.  The rest of the food was mediocre and even the fruit seemed a little less than fresh.  The selections are limited and some things seem out of place such as the sushi and shrimp being at the salad bar.  For desert, the chef was helpful in cutting fresh pieces for customers and the few items sampled were good.  They don't have a large variety of ice cream flavors but the vanilla ice cream tasted good, similar to bryers.  This place is not worth a return trip."}
{"text":"For value this place gets a 5 Star rating.  Breakfast is 4.99, Lunch 7.99 and Dinner 13.99 for adults with a free players club card.  Plus you get several 2 for 1 buffets each year with the players club card.  Not a bad deal.  The food is fresh and they really keep the buffet clean.  The selection is not as wide as some of the more expensive buffets but they have some seasonal fare like bagels and lox around Jewish holidays and different themes like Italian week or Irish.  Excellent place to take the kids as the price is right and there are many food choices for kids (pizza, mac and cheese, sushi for my seven year old).  It is more than worth the price but buffets are always a step down from a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Paulo is a very discriminating Manager. 6 of us tried to go and pay full price to go and eat there but the other 2 that were with us already ate, and they wouldn't let them simply sit down and sit with us. I am 100% sure they discriminized against us and will to anyone else. I will 0/10 recommend never. Very poor staff. Very uncomfortable situation. Held up the whole line."}
{"text":"Overall, this buffet is good, but there have been moments where it's not so good. For the most part, breakfast is consistently good. They have two omelet stations at each end. You can choose to get an omelet or just some fresh scrambled eggs and they also use fresh egg whites upon request. The buffet usually offers bacon and sausage and they also have ham sliced by the butcher. On Sundays, they'll include more meat choices like sausages, brisket, and prime rib, in addition to adding Mimosas or Bloody Mary's to the menu.   I've also been here for lunch and while they have some good choices, some things have been a disappointment, like the Mac and cheese. At lunch and dinner, they open up the dessert bar and will offer everything from cakes and pies to ice creams and gelatos. I enjoy their breakfast buffet the most. Their banana nut muffin is one of my favorites! They also serve waffles, pancakes, French toast, and many other choices. During a holiday or special event, they also change up the menu and offer specialty items."}
{"text":"Buffets. What can you say?  The buffet at the Sunset is exactly what you pay for.  It's never going to be the best in town, but it is consistent and it's pretty good food.  My kids love the buffet and we go for them, and we take all our out of town guests, so that's a boon for them.     The food is always hot, and the cut to order meat is good and well seasoned.  If you a little picky and watch what you get it is good.  Some of the food spends to much under the lights, so you do have to be a little careful."}
{"text":"This buffett was better years ago when it opened.  Just went on a Saturday night.  They had prime rib and tukey at the carving station.  Buffett food usually isn't that great and I understand that, but the taste overall was not there.  I liked the pizza the best."}
{"text":"This buffett was much better years ago.  I went on a Saturday night with the pass, only $11.99.  For that price you can't complain at all.  The taste of the food could be better and better selection as well.  They have prime rib and turket at the carving station and the pizza was the best."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of AYCE buffets, so my expectations are pretty high.  So, for $18.99 Feast buffet just didn't have the quality or choices that would merit such a high price.  Yeah, I know that if I had a pass, the price would be $13.99, but the in-laws forgot their card, so we had to pay full price.  Granted the meal does come with champagne/mimosa, which is a plus, but they had the same old boring choice of food...breakfast items, chinese food, salad bar, etc. The prime rib wasn't even tender and flavorful.  Perhaps if they had the famous crab legs that I have seen other Yelpers rave about, I would give them higher marks.  But alas, they weren't serving the crab legs on the Sunday I went.  Also, their desserts were pretty cheesy...donuts, pie, and cookies...I expected more.  Their gelato wasn't even good either.  I think that the buffet at M Resort is a better buffet for the price and they even have AYCD alcholic beverages.  Sorry Feast Buffet, it will be my first and last time I dine here."}
{"text":"Great service me and oir family have come here for years and the food its so good and the personal its very nice."}
{"text":"Many times a Patron, excellent buffet, nice desserts, Asian, Italian, salads, fruits, etc.  But mostly I wanted to comment on the Servers. I waited once 20 minutes just to tip a male Server - who thought I left - 10 bucks. When I go back I'll try to catch his name and add to this review. Recently, I met up with Olivia;  not old (as in person) but old school, as in refreshing. Never been to a buffet in Vegas where the Server brought me new utensils. She did. Very gracious, certainly not a Union Employee, which you'd know because she would not have done that. Besides the utensils, Olivia was on top of things the entire meal, as if it was not a buffet but a full serve restaurant.   She didn't just serve coffee and disappear. Yes, my remark about the Union adds to this review. I hear they're  trying to Unionize. My hope is that management can compromise to keep union free. Those contracts will be amended on a daily basis without union members approval, or even knowing. A year later members find that they are no more than a another $union due$ making the union rich and that their protections have evaporated. The Red Rock is probably the best international, yet at the same time, neighborhood place to go. I hope it stays that way. The best way to maintain the quality of customer service is promotion based on quality of service, based on incentive."}
{"text":"Average at best.   I am expecting better from the higher end of the Stations properties.   I expected it to be on par with Red Rock but that was not the case.    I was unimpressed and a bit disappointed with the food selection and quality.    The service is decent.   The line was manageable but a bit haphazard.  The location decor is good and pretty well kept."}
{"text":"Red Rock Buffet is probably the cleanest of the Stations properties buffets.   The price makes this place a great value.   The food is adequate and there is plenty of it.  The quality of food is what you would expect from a Stations buffet.  Personally, these eating venues are not my thing but the other half enjoys them.   If we have to do a Stations buffet I prefer the selections at the Green Valley Ranch Feast over Red Rock.  If you are looking for fish, then hit up the Sunset Station Feast buffet.  There is usually four different fish dishes offered."}
{"text":"11 bucks for dinner All you can eat Decent food but nothing special Good selection of choices Clean dining room Service was friendly  What more do you want for 11 bucks?"}
{"text":"Visiting after last visit a few months ago. NO lines at the buffet, for supper and breakfast and tonight's supper... Hmmm... Food for supper same-o, same-o, NOTHING different these first two nights. Irish lamb stew and colcannon potatoes did not appear to have had many takers... Italian pasta bar selection nothing to write home about. Not many gambling... Has there been another casino opening, something is happening to the amount of guests... Good thing: You must use your guest key to operate the elevators now... Still get that sewer gas smell from the bathroom sink (Been that way for years, also smell the phew coming from the pool area)... Guess it's time to go casino exploring..."}
{"text":"We were staying at the casino hotel on Sunday night and decided to give the very reasonably priced buffet a try. It was $14.99 with the players club card or $19.99 without. We arrived right as they were starting dinner service and there was no line but within minutes after we were seated a large line had formed. There were many things to choose from including Chinese, Mexican, Prime Rib and Fish. There were also several salads and even sushi. The dessert area was full of delicious offerings and also included ice cream and shakes made to order. The service was fantastic and the food was really good. We would definitely return."}
{"text":"You'll save a couple dollars by signing up for the players club card. We paid 26$ total for lunch which is a good price compared to most buffets down the strip. Has good variety of food."}
{"text":"Great buffet. Not too punishing on the wallet, especially if you have boarding pass points or coupons.  If you come around 3:30 (I know it's a bit early for dinner) you can sneak in and only pay lunch prices.  The service is good. My drink never went dry and plates were cleared as soon as they were done.  If you're having trouble making a decision on what you want to eat, stop by the Feast buffet in the Red Rock where you don't have to settle on one thing."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, it's edible to say the least. The chicken Parmesan is really the only thing I had that I enjoyed. The place is smaller than I anticipated and the variety is lacking. The desserts were okay. While trying to pay the cashier INSISTED that we get a rewards card or something to pay ~$9 per person. We were already hungry and our friend finally got one of those damn cards. We get to the cashier again and she tells us that we need 2 cards to pay half price for 4 people. Ugh. To boot, the cashier moved at a glacial pace. Dear god. We were hungry and this lady is taking her sweet time to finish the transaction and giving us shade. The waiting staff was pleasant, though. It'd be more worth it to just spend your money on fast food. McDonald's anyone?"}
{"text":"Buffet was great. Very pretty restaurant and yummy :) best buffet out of the 3 station casino buffets in Henderson."}
{"text":"This is one of the best buffets in Vegas hands down. If you are planning on visiting only one buffet, try this one. It's worth every penny."}
{"text":"I went to this buffet for lunch, there was a line which was expected, and honestly it's pretty good, they have a wide variety of options and it's pretty good, I loved the BBQ!(: and it was pretty cheap compared to other buffets in Vegas. 10/10. I would recommend to people know."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for over 10 years. It was definitely the best buffet for the price. Like many Las Vegas buffets the quality has slowly gone down hill. Today I had about my worst service experience,  which will probably mark my last visit to The Feast Buffet. I waited over 15 minutes for drinks. When we went for more food we came back to find out table covered in used drink cups, plates and food spilled on out table. Looked like they were just thrown there, rather gross. The table next to use experienced the same thing. Quality of the food is not great and the service was terrible. Needless to say this marks the second time in my life I did not leave a tip."}
{"text":"I love coming here for breakfast, they have an omelette station where you can have them make your personally customized omelette. What I love about here is that they are constantly refilling the buffet keep the food warm and fresh.  Between lunches and dinner the only difference is that they have shrimp and at the Mongolian grill station the meats change to include shrimp, that's it no huge difference. They do however have a huge selection of dessert which is always a plus for someone with a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"For $11.99, you really can't beat it. I wish buffets had \"seafood-free\" days where you could try them out, minus the markup for seafood I never eat. I hate having to fork out a ton of cash to cover the cost of the gluttonous jerks who pile their plates up with the legs of 40 crabs in a night.   My sister and I had to wait maybe 20 minutes to get up to the register and less than 5 to get seated. I had the turkey, gravy and small sweet potato which were good. I asked for the skin as well which tasted a little funky. The stuffing tasted like flour and the mac and cheese was so bad, I couldn't finish it.  I had three fried shrimp which were decent, the ranch salad which was eh, a slice of the veggie pizza which was good, half of the toppings off a slice of mushroom pizza - bleh, two \"bowls\" of lox topped with fresh purple onion, cream cheese and capers. YUM!   I also tried a bite of bread pudding which tasted like raw pancake batter so I spit it out, a few bites over under-ripe watermelon, a couple bites of soft-serve vanilla custard which was too sweet, a bite of chocolate cream pie but tasted like pudding, and a bite of really delish cheesecake.   Service was fast but I tried too many things I didn't like. It's a more upscale version of the buffet at Sunset Station."}
{"text":"Probably the best of the Station Casino buffets, simply because they have sushi! Well, and they have a ton of choices for Asian food and a pretty decent selection of salads.  Most Station Casino buffets are geared toward the old, smoker, bingo crowd - who generally don't appreciate seasoned foods.  Maybe because this doesn't sit smack dab in the middle of a Sun City, the selection is better flavored.  Even though my parents live within spitting distance of Green Valley, they tend to drive all the way over here to eat at this buffet, but apparently the Chanukah menu was just okay here.   Anyway, on 3/13/14 I had a 2 for 1 coupon here and my dad and I had lunch for $7.99. Not a bad deal!"}
{"text":"Went here on 1/15/11 with my parents, two sisters and brother for dinner last night. With the boarding pass, this month, it was $8.99 a person for dinner. My youngest sister's meal was free, even though she's 4.  The wait was extremely short compared to say the Wynn buffet's line. Once we were seated, we realized our poor waitress was overwhelmed with the amount of tables in her section. She was busing tables and filling drinks for way too many people which led to me getting one refill in more than an hour. It wasn't her fault, it was management's.   I didn't eat anything from the carving station because I was too full from the day's earlier CMYE at The Auld Dubliner earlier that day. I tried a dab of the shrimp fettuccine, macaroni & cheese, and the cheese ravioli, none of which were good. Next I tried the Mexican bar - I like that they have stuff out to make your own nachos, but the pico was bland and the salsa was too. The chicken in green enchilada sauce was absolutely delicious, so I ate a bit more of that.   For desserts, I tried the mini shot glass of cheesecake - unfortunately the cheesecake was the no-bake kind. I also tried the tiny tiramisu and that was a little better.  I had a tablespoon of bread pudding with the vanilla whiskey sauce - very good. I also had a scoop of butter pecan ice cream that was decent.   Overall, a good deal but unfortunately, most of what I ate was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"This place used to be a good stop, but the last few times the quality has fallen off the side of the Grand Canyon. While the food may have good and bad days, what doesn't change is the customer service. These people are miserable and couldn't care less about what you want to say. Talk to a manager and if you're not happy about something, they'll just turn and walk away. Cashiers dramatically slow down 30 minutes before a breakfast/lunch/dinner change, so a giant line forms. Came at 10:15 for breakfast (which ends seating at 10:45) and finally got up to pay at 10:43, and watched the cashier have a personal conversation with sometime else. 2 minutes later, it's 10:45 and she turns and tells my party \"lunch prices\". Really? We just stood in line for 30 minutes and heard what you want to do after you get off? Not happy? \"That's just the way it is. Cash or card?\". Amusingly, Jack the \"manager\" proceeded to seat us, and asked how things were. Obviously we were unhappy and told him what happened - he proceeded to go \"hmm\" and walked off.   Fast forward to the food. Once you get around the maze of walkers and uncontrolled children, you'll get to the food. Now, if you come at a change time, you'll be greeted by \"kitchen managers\" who literally tell you to go away while they finish making the food to change the trays out.   I get there are time limits and rules, but like a number of other people who have wrote reviews, it's not our fault that you don't have cashiers because your staff is guarding the buffet lines like it was a beach in Normandy. I'll go to M next time, and get a much better meal with people who actually care about their jobs and making people happy. Or at least aren't sour about having to come into work today. If you must support a station casino buffet, try the Palms before it slides off a cliff like the rest of their establishments."}
{"text":"The fruit, oatmeal and yogurt bar feels unhealthy when they start taking out the big garbage can from it's center area. That guy keeps playing wih the plastic bags hard enough and spread some trash to the food area."}
{"text":"If you came to Vegas looking for a buffet, this is a good one. One of my favorite things about it is that it is located at a great property, the Red Rock Resort. This is a relatively new, well-maintained and modern resort in Vegas.  With a Players Card, you get a substantial discount, around $6-8 dollars depending on when you go. That brings the buffet into very reasonable price territory. (And since a buffet really is a hunt for value, you care about this, right?)  The line begins about 30 minutes before each meal begins. Earlier if there is a special going on. The seating is all relatively close to the buffet, which is another important aspect of your \"stuffing\" strategy.   The buffet has several prep stations, where you can request food made to order. The chefs seemed very pleasant and willing to help you get what you wanted. There were at least 7 different stations, and even for a weekend dinner, there were never really lines to get anything. That's a huge plus at a place like this.  My favorite part: The Dessert Bar was surprisingly well-appointed for an AYCE, which was great. They had several very good flavors of gelato, which I loved.  Only downside: The seafood, and especially the sushi, were not that great. Pretty typical for a place like this, but I had hoped for better."}
{"text":"We have been going to this buffet off and on for years and the quality is definitely headed downhill. We took the kids yesterday and we disliked almost everything and we are not picky.   The fruit was fine, of course that would be awfully hard to mess up, but the mashed potatoes, grits, pot stickers, rice, and several other little things were pretty bad and left on the plates. My husband did like the pulled pork, and my daughter liked the pork buns....guess it was a good pork day? My favorite thing was the sourdough bread and butter, if that tells you anything. The kids said the ice cream was good, but my pumpkin pie was gross and artificial tasting.  We have noticed that the quality is better on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. Not sure if that is because there is more turnover or you cannot use your 2 for 1 coupons those days. This buffet is possibly worth it, if you have the 2 for 1 (8.99 for 2 lunches) otherwise, this would be near the bottom of my list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Had lunch buffet here. Food was delicious and selection was good. Slightly better than  the typical cheap local casino buffet food."}
{"text":"We went there last year and the food was good . Then went again last week the salad bar wasn't very good the romaine lettuce was wilty . Not a big selection of fruit, only had a little bit of turkey and it didn't taste good . Last year they had good roast beef.  It just went down hill . We travel from north LAS Vegas   We have one1 more 2 for 1 buffet next month if the food is the same we won't be back."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not fantastic either.   We found ourselves at Sunset Station and hungry. We wanted Mexican food, but found that they have closed their Mexican restaurant. This was the best alternative.  It was a Friday night and not busy at all. There was no line and we were assisted immediately. The cashier told us we could save $4 off of our dinner by using our boarding pass. I didn't have it with me and we were too lazy to get a new one, so we paid full price.   There are lots of different stations, all pretty typical buffet foods. Everything I had was pretty good, but I just didn't find anything really special about it. I am not much of a buffet person - I'd rather spend the same amount on 1 dish that is made really well instead of having a hodge podge of random foods.  Anyhow, our server was very nice and kept our drinks full. Probably not a place we will go back to, but it filled our bellies that night."}
{"text":"Customer service was good...but that is the only thing that was good about the Buffett. The food was probably the worst I have ever tasted in a Buffett.  I can't believe that the head cook actually allows them to serve this food!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this buffet for years and quite honestly I believe this buffet is better than most of the buffets on the strip and at a fraction of the price. Can beat a breakfast buffet price that is currently at $6.99 per person and actually taste really good? What's even better is that you can finish off your meal with not just ice cream like most buffet, but gelato and make is a shake. The only thing I really miss about this place was that years ago, they use to serve stir fried crab legs that is the absolute best crab legs I've ever had.   Word of advice. If you are planning on getting here for breakfast or for lunch, get here early. Lunch technically starts at 11:30 but people are lining up since 9:30 and can take you more than an hour just waiting in line just to get in.  Update: On Fridays, they do have seafood night where they will stir fry your crab legs with spicy sauces. Happiness returns!"}
{"text":"It was an average buffet.  Actually, maybe average is a little too generous.   Now - with that said.....I am not a fan of buffets but did feel slightly excited as this one claimed to be voted the best (maybe for their square mile of Vegas).  Service was pretty slow with lots of mistakes on the drinks.  Even the Pepsi drinks were flat.   Overall - not worth the trip or the money.  Go somewhere else.  A fast food restaurant would provide you with a better meal and experience."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.   The ads said voted best.  NO WAY.  Most everything we had was very dry and mostly tasteless.   If this is best in Vegas i feel sorry.  The golden corral is better.   Much better.  We had dinner. Maybe breakfast or lunch is better.  I should give only 1 star but i was in a good mood."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast buffet and then we were takin so long we got a little lunch. The breakfast was really good, if it was fresh. Like i had some o'brien potatoes that were so hard and you could tell they were sitting out for a while. The waffles looked overcooked and my friend would not stop complaining that she couldn't eat her waffles without strawberry sauce. I have been to this buffet many times actually. I only paid $11 and it was worth! They had so many meats like sausages and bacon i was so happy. I would come back to get me sum meat."}
{"text":"Love the dinner buffet at Green Valley!!!  Roast beef is awesome!!!  Great deal for locals!!!"}
{"text":"$9.99 if you have a player's card!   We had a table with a clean high chair waiting for us. That impressed me.  Food quality is medium...not bad enough to complain but not good enough to crave.   My dad was in town and he's a picky eater so I figured out of these 100 options he could find something to eat...and he did!  James, our server, was great.  There was a table full of drunk old ladies hitting on him for at least an hour and he was a good sport.  You're going to heaven, James :) Old ladies need lovin', too."}
{"text":"Sante Fe Station should be ashamed of themselves!!!  They heavily advertised their \"Special\" Veteran's Day to buy one get one free buffet with your Military Boarding Pass on Friday November 10. I decided to take a veteran friend for lunch. We checked their website to be sure of the hours and it is clearly stated that lunch is served until 4PM Monday through Friday. We arrived at 2:15 and were told they were closing at 3PM instead of 4. My friend was of course disappointed but we decided that since we were already there we would go ahead and rush through lunch. As we were leaving at 3PM they were turning away vets in wheelchairs and on canes among others.  What an absolute disgrace Sante Fe Station !!!! I will NEVER step foot in that casino again !!!"}
{"text":"When at the mongolian BBQ station, ask for Garlic ONLY. Then get a garlic chili soy sauce on the side. You will finsh the dish as it won't be salty as the ocean. The chef said it wasn't him but I said he was the only one there each time we came this year and he poured a generous salt filled teriyaki sauce to raise my blood pressure.  This time I directed and made sure there wouldn't be a waste of rejected food. I HOPE HE LEARNED HIS LESSON FROM ALL THE COMPLAINTS. He'll do well."}
{"text":"We have been eating here monthly for over ten years, but no more. We arrived Friday night at 7:40 PM (they close at 9 PM), and they were totally out of BBQ ribs and sushi. Their price has increased from $15.95 to $19.95, and they are not worth the increase. In my opinion, this buffet is no longer a good buffet. Sam's Town is $9 cheaper and the food quality is just as good."}
{"text":"Well since this is a buffet, I guess I can't complain about the amount of food you get HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA  Alright, so I came here with a few friends for breakfast. The line was kind of long but it turns out one of my friends had some bonus card that reduced the line and price on groups of up to 4. That was pretty cool to pay like 6 bucks for breakfast.  French Toast- generic, solid french toast triangles. you can dress them up in cinnamon and powdered sugar later on if you want. Waffles- tiny belgian waffles that are surprisingly very good! This was the item i was pretty impressed with and went back for many.   Bacon- most of the time the pieces were very thin and a bit too crispy for me. Sausage- Juicy thin pork sausage. they went well with the french toast. I love buffet sausage though. Chicken Fried Steak- small (maybe 3 bites), but had a lot of flavor, especially with the gravy, which was being rotated consistently. A high point. Eggs- Buffet eggs....I can't stand them at all, but they had a choice of regular scrambled eggs, or \"spanish\" style with some peppers and onions in it which actually made them tolerable to me.  There was an omelet station but the line was ludicrous. It seemed to be legit, with 4 stations and a chef assigned to 2 each with all the traditional omelet toppings like mushrooms, ham, cheeses, peppers, etc. I'm a huge fan of buffet omelets because they are real eggs cooked fresh and to order. However I passed on it this time because of my own time constraints.  Overall, for the special price I paid for this breakfast, I definitely would have given it 4 stars, but if I had to pay full price (which is how I'm judging this), it would be 3. Definitely not the worst breakfast buffet, and matches anything you could find on the Strip."}
{"text":"I've been to the feast buffet 3 times and the food is consistently mediocre. There is decent value here, but the food is as you should expect. You are getting what you pay for. That said, each time I've tried the feast buffet it's satisfied what I've wanted. Except the time I wanted a donut for breakfast and they ran out.   Because the buffet is a good value expect to wait in line. Especially during peak tines."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm from the BAY AREA, so nice Buffets are not something we have.   So going to Vegas is a treat for us to enjoy a Buffet, This one is nice, clean, well managed. The food is good, the service is also good.  We had donuts, muffins,eggs, chinese food,soup,pizza& pasta and finally... delicious gelato mint&pistachio!  It was all good, then we were smack dab in the middle of the RED ROCK CASINO-YAY!!!"}
{"text":"First off , it's a buffet. I've only gone to lunch, but they have a good selection. You don't have to deal with Strip or Freemont traffic and its at a good price. The biggie that nobody had mentioned- or maybe it missed it is that it's pretty. The casino itself is fun to walk through with the cloud painted ceiling and the grotto bar and the buffet is nicely decorated, too in green and amber. Deff a place I'd bring my mom to.  They have a friendly staff and we didn't have to wait long to get in, another plus!"}
{"text":"People need to be realistic when reviewing places like this. Its an all you can eat buffet for 11 dollars if you have their free rewards card membership. Its not the Bellagio or Caesars buffet for 50 bucks a plate.   My girlfriend and I have been back multiple times since our first trip here: once for a mid week dinner and twice for brunch on Sunday. Every time its been a very short wait, maybe 10 minutes to be seated. The food is what you'd expect from a 11 dollar buffet. Its not mouth watering, but its better than average. The breakfast bar is very good if you get there in time for it.  Will continue to go back every Sunday for brunch. For those prices the value is unbeatable."}
{"text":"I must say I was very impressed with this Buffett. My boyfriend and I were looking to eat during our date night, and he stumbled upon this during his \"Best of Las Vegas.\" Search. I must say I was shocked at first, but decided to give it a try because there has a be a reason why they are rated the best buffet in Las Vegas. From the moment I walked in, to the moment I left, I was impressed. The restaurant was clean and the decor was really nice! Also , it was not extremely loud much like a lot of buffets on the strip. The service was amazing, very tentative. The food was the best part. Fresh, hot, and the bbq was amazing. (We kept coming back for the ribs.) the only advice I would give is to make sure you have a players card, you get a discount on the Price for the Buffett. :) I recommend this place to locals if your looking to get away from the strip, and want some good grub!"}
{"text":"Red Rock Casino Hotel has a pretty good buffet.  We ate the dinner buffet on Saturday night, the Sunday brunch buffet and the weekday breakfast buffet.  Note:  Sign up for Boarding Pass to get the special buffet prices.  The dinner buffet and the Sunday brunch buffet each cost $12.99 - such a lot of food for this meagre price.  The breakfast buffet is even cheaper; $4.99.  Good variety of food - seafood, sushi, Chinese, Mexican, American, Italian and Desserts.  Breakfast has an omelette station, eggs benedict, sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs.    Good food for a good price."}
{"text":"Good price. $19.99 per adult with red players card. A must to get the players club card. The prime rib was the best I've had at a buffet so far. The pork was also yummy. Babbaganush was good and dessert was plenty. No line and plenty of room to sit. Very satisfied and full."}
{"text":"Another \"fine\" establishment brought to you courtesy of the Station casino group. A friend dragged me there for lunch (kicking and screaming and under duress) I found a old tyme Vegas casino right out of the 80's....dingy...brought back unpleasant memories from the past....but lets leave nostalgia alone and move to the buffet, as expected it was crowded, the decor brought more unneeded memories from the 80's (stop it) The buffet selection itself its quite small compared to other Station buffets and I expected the food to be worst (how can it be?, that is an impossibility) but I do have to admit that all in all, and in comparison it was not that bad (or maybe I was just hungry, who knows) and I did find a few things to nibble on, had some cat fish (not bad) mussels (most were empty) a piece of fried chicken (overly salted), tried a some dessert, it was old and dry. All in all, and compared to some of  the fancier Feast buffets it was not the worst, and that is not an insult my friends!! Bottom line: if you do like de ja vus from the 80's....and a simple no nonsense menu (with some eatable items) at a reasonable cost....this is for you.  ,"}
{"text":"Got to love station casino buffets, they take after Mcdonald's in principle, whichever one of them you visit you get exactly the same food ...and non of it is any good, amazing how they manage that, one would think that even the worst cook might manage by mistake to make something good every once in a while.....but not here! Most if not all dishes can be divided into groups and they intersect. 1. overcooked (vast majority) 2 undercooked 3. flavorless 4. Salty beyond belief. 5 dry as a bone Well..now you are thinking to yourself...I'll just have some salad!....you head to the salad bar and find nothing appetizing...everything looks old as if it sat there ALL day.....but it's 10 am....how is that possible? The only saving grace was the omelet station, it was made fresh and was well received, everything else? forgetabouit!  In conclusion, if you like yesterdays left overs, this is the place for you, if not...pass."}
{"text":"In order to have a good experience at the The Feast buffet you have to come in with a mindset that you get what you pay for. This buffet is only $5.99 for breakfast. With that being said everything on my review is being judge on a value derivative point of view which is only fair to the establishment. The cashier was not very friendly and could have been a bit nicer when asked if they provided Wi-Fi. The host could have been more engaging walking us to our seats. The waitress was always sweet, engaging, and consistently fast. My recommendations include the chilaquiles, the Hawaiian pizza, and the ice cream bar (a must have). On the other hand stay away from the refried beans, the menudo, and the pastries which deteriorate in quality every year. My humble suggestion to the chef would be to redo the menu. There are so many other recipes that can't be created at this price point, I would love to see them make an appearance. This place  is geared towards locals and for the most part we know this is the type of experience we expect at this price point. If your not a local don't expect this to be The Bacchanal buffet at Caesars palace or you'll be very disappointed."}
{"text":"Food's not particularly great, but the price makes up for it :) I like the self serve icecream station :) my twist cone with oreo crumble was Yum."}
{"text":"Red Rock Buffet is very popular with locals, especially on weekends.    I was in line @ 10:15 on Saturday morning.  After a 30-minute wait, the Hostess announced it was \"Lunch Hour.\"  Lunch Buffet was a good value @ $12.99.    Huge Salad Bar with a smorgasbord of offerings.    Shrimp Ceviche was watery.  Entrees & Sides were average.    Dessert Buffet was massive, & I loved the Gelato bar with 9 flavors!  I'm giving 4**** for Price / Salads / Desserts /"}
{"text":"Ok... is this some fancy hotspot buffet like on the Strip?  Absolutely not.   Have I noticed a distinct shift in foods items in terms of high end over the past few years?   Yes.  However, I will say that for the price point you get exactly what you should.   No it's not fancy but I've never had a major issue with quality.   Not everything is perfect all the time but can you really expect that?   The lines are usually pretty long on holidays and such but they move fairly fast on the weekends.     The service isn't terrible and most of the people who work here are very friendly and accommodating.     I wouldn't tell you to make a special trip just to come to this buffet but if you're in the area or if you get discounts like I do then it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This was so worth the price and drive away from the strip.  With the players card it was $8.99 for lunch buffet, about a 10 min wait since we had a large party.  It was the day after Thanksgiving.  The night before we waited for Thanksgiving buffet at Main Street Station and it was $14.99 per adult, with a 2-1/2 hour wait!  The selection at the Feast was much better and the food was more tasty.  Sorry, Main Street.  You were my go-to until now!  Ask for a table inside, away from the Casino.  The smoke still had a chance to make it into the eating area if you sit close to the perimeter."}
{"text":"Ok I'll be the first to admit I'm not a buffet fan, you just eat to damn much no matter how hard you may try not to. So with that being said I thought it'd be best to go on Prime Rib night but then I thought how good could prime rib from a buffet be? Well I'll be damn if the prime rib was excellent, plus the sauces and sides to make it complete including sweet potatoes. The meat was very well seasoned and I had to go back for more, see you do eat to much as I had to try some other items as well. And of course you can't leave without a trip to the Gelato station. Okay I'm stuffed just thinking about it. The ambiance is nice as it is anywhere in Red Rock and after I burn off the 10 thousand calories I ate I'll be back."}
{"text":"This review is for the buffet.  We stayed at a different hotel (but we have stayed here before, and had no problems, it's a clean and comfy hotel).  The food here is WAY more expensive than the other buffets in Vegas, and a real pleasant surprise regarding the food.  Both my children are vegetarians, and there was plenty for them to eat.  Lots of great breakfast options for everyone as well.  The one and only thing I'd like to see change is that some of the food items need to be kept hotter.  But seriously, that's it.  The service is friendly, coffee is diner-coffee good and hot, orange juice is good, food was great for an amazing price.  We tried the Circus-Circus buffet one day and had such a bad and over-priced experience, we asked our friends who lived locally what they recommended & it was Palace Station, which we had known of bc we had stayed there years before.  Thanks goodness for this place!"}
{"text":"Sunday Brunch: The salad bar seemed to save me I went back twice, then got some roasted turkey and bacon, made a decent salad. I tried the pasta one bite no flavor no thank you, fried chicken one bite it was dry and vile, prime rib so dry I just gave up. The Chinese food was slopped together and soggy, no way! The turkey gravy I tasted and it was disgusting. Do not touch the desserts they are there to look at but not to consume....the after taste of chemicals will linger in your mouth for hours after just one bite! We tried four different desserts and they were the worst thing I've ever eaten. It was an adventure dining here because you actually have to forage in order to find edible food, never again!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for the Saturday buffet for the first time.  I grabbed a players card to get a discount over non-discounted price.  The displays all feature the discounted rate as the price so make sure to get the card. The atmosphere was fine as the whole casino is clean and styled pretty nicely, but the food was hit or miss on taste and quality.  There were only a couple of items from each section that were good but nothing outstanding and I was very hungry upon arrival.  For half the price it may be OK.  I have had much better at a lower price.  The prime rib was mostly unchewable sinew ridden fat so I switched to turkey which was decent. I tried a made to order milk shake and even that was so-so.  The salad bar had mostly tired looking offerings but the seasoned olives were addictive. It looks like based upon the recent reviews that the quality has slipped and from my first time there the amount and types of offerings are dismal. I have even tried Circus Circus a couple of years ago and it rivals or exceeds this -- and that is Circus Circus I am talking about!"}
{"text":"My girl and I went to the dinner buffet on a Friday night. Prices were reasonable at $18.95 per person,  not bad!  She had the sushi and Asian dishes.  I stuck to American and had a HUGE PLATE of mashed potatoes and cream corn!  Both were delicious!  With it I had a second plate covered in Prime Rib (nearly as big as my plate) along with some cornbread!  After devouring those two plates of food,  I opted for some desert.  Bad choice,  because they had my favorite,  German Chocolate Cake!  I killed about 3 pieces of that stuff,  and a piece of Tiramisu!  At this point I had already refilled my Coke a Cola about 7 times,  so one might assume that I was full!    Hell yes I was full,  and my tummy did not like it one bit!  I thought I was going to burst.  Bad stomach ache for about a half hour after I ate,  but it soon went away once I took $10 to the Craps table and combined with my Girl made $260!  Not a bad way to cure a stomach ache.  If I did not eat like a hostage and give myself a tummy ache I would of given 5 stars!  Overall,  food was great,  prices were good,  service was good,  and the environment and surroundings were pleasant.  I will definitely be returning to Red Rock Casino on my next visit to Vegas,  and the choice has already been made regarding which buffet to eat at...Feast Buffet at Red Rock.  Make the drive to this place,  it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch and as a players card member I got a very nice discount for us! The food was quite good, especially the Asian food. the desserts were very nice and each station has something delish worth going back for seconds on. I love RED ROCKS!!! it is my fave Station Casino by far!"}
{"text":"The buffet is good when you have a local coupon for dinner, bogo! I had a free birthday coupon for a birthday offer for the month of May. Good for when no one know what they want, so everybody is happy with some kind of choice of food. They have pizza, mexican, chinese, american, and italian. Salad bar and a stir fry bar. Soups and desserts of many choices."}
{"text":"Food is okay, but well worth it for the price. You can get breakfast for $5.99, lunch for $6.99 and dinner for $7.99 if you sign up for the free Players Card. Soft drinks are included in the price. This is the cheapest I've seen in Vegas! We went for lunch, and there was a  decent variety of food along with plenty of desserts. The place is very clean (unlike the hotel), and the servers were friendly and efficient. I would definitely recommend this buffet if you're looking to eat cheap. I'll never stay in the hotel again, but will definitely return to the Buffet."}
{"text":"I must say, as buffets go, this one is good. Real good. We went for breakfast one Monday morning with some friends that were in town and we all left with full bellies and wallets still intact. Get this folks, a breakfast buffet that isn't just decent-- it's great--for the bargain price of $6.99 per person.  Of course, that's with your player's card, but if you're one of those weirdos that thinks the government is tracking your every move and don't want to give your personal information to those sneaky casinos, you're going to pay a whole dollar more. Yeah, that's $7.99. For a great buffet that includes made to order omelets, mini Belgium waffles complete with maple syrup or berries, all the crispy bacon you can inhale, bagels that you can load with inches of cream cheese or salmon and capers, delectable quiche, fresh fruit galore, pastries that would make the French proud and then some mediocre options like oatmeal and cold cereal.  Bonus: Amazingly, you won't smell smoke while eating OR leave smelling like smoke. Unless of course you spend your time digesting at one of those highly tempting coin-suckers. And even then you can sit in a non-smoking section for your gambling, asthma-attack-free, pleasure. Two words to sum up Red Rock's Feast Buffet for breakfast: LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing for the price! Try their fried rice and prime rib. If you're there for breakfast, then you can't beat the two over easy with hash browns, corn beef, and bacon. The waitress Julia is super nice as well. It's our go to place whenever we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Well there are a lot of Feast Buffets from the Station Casinos. I think we have been to them all at one time or another. This one is a little better over most of them.   Sometimes you have a long wait here for dinner. The service can be hit or miss depending on who you get as with anywhere,  We have had good and bad service here over the years.   We came one night it happen to be Hawaiian night, Were not crazy about a lot of  Hawaiian dishes but we could not believe they had a whole pig out. I am surprised it did not cause any problems here. The pig was cooked perfect and it was really good.  The salad bar is a pretty good size and they usually always have some kind of soup that is really good.  This buffet is usually always clean and well kept. We have never had too many problems other than how fast the service was for cleaning off the tables or getting our drinks.  And you need to make sure it is a night you want what they are serving, the theme of the night.  It is not bad of a buffet we go on and off if were close by. Its not horrible by no means. Try it out!  ( This is more of a Locals Casino too far from the strip)"}
{"text":"I wish you could be able to give a negative amount of stars. This place is beyond horrible. The food is just nasty and the service is worse!!!! I hate giving bad reviews, but seriously, this place is a ZERO."}
{"text":"If there was zero stars, I think I wold choose this, DO NOT eat here.... I am a buffet guy, I love buffet, that being said this is the worst buffet place I have eaten at... First off, the food was virtually flavorless, that normally isn't a problem when at buffets, sometimes.... It happens. There were three of us that had eaten, and every single one of us lost our food about 10 minutes from calling it quits trying to make this cardboard taste good.  Our waitress was a sweetheart and really was the only reason that I felt I could actually push the one star rating.  Overall this was the worst experience I have ever had at a buffet."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where people are finding a problem but I found the breakfast buffet to be good. They have such a variety of food from Mexican, carved ham or turkey, Asian, including Mongolian Barbeque, to made-to-order omelets. The even had chicken fried steak and corned beef. We went about 10:15 a.m. and they change over to lunch at 10:45 so we got the best of both worlds, breakfast and lunch. And non-alcoholic beverages are included in your meal. The only negative I could say was that a few of the dishes like Spanish rice and potato latke we're not real warm. I guess they were changing over to lunch shortly and didn't want to add more hot food to the existing. Overall I can say there was quite a bit for a vegetarian to eat."}
{"text":"I use to hit up the M Buffet every time I visit Vegas bc it was cheap, clean and good food (prime rib for lunch whaaaaat??). BUT like all good buffet empires... They crumble.   Enter the Feast at Red Rock casino. This place is underrated. Get a players club (if you dont have one) and you and a friend can get a meal at a discounted price-- $8.95.   This place is clean, service is courteous, food is good (come at the right time), and I like the set up--it's well spread out for a buffet. Salad bar is damn good, breakfast is bomb, lunch is bomb also, and their dessert is pretty good too.   Cons: It's not that big, so not much selections compared to other casino buffets. BUT for $8.95 I'm cool with that!   Ill definitely come back, MIGHT even be my go to buffet spot. ;)   If you plan on coming, be sure you don't get here late bc quality won't be there."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is good here. Nice variety. I especially enjoyed their desserts. We signed up for their players card and the lunch buffet was only $8 each. No reason to roam all over Vegas to find a decent place to eat. This place is not the greatest but it is good enough."}
{"text":"The food is on par with any decent casino buffet, but having to pay full $19.99 price for a 5 year old is a bit ridiculous IMO, so definitely skip it if you have kids..."}
{"text":"so make sure that you give yourself plenty of time the line to get into the buffet is really long and I am here on a Wednesday evening nothing special the food selection and choices are actually very very good and the price is really good as well some of the food is amazing quality and some of the food is not amazing quality, it really is hit or mess but most of the time it is a hit"}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor of this hotel I'm usually impressed with the service.  Today foods tasted varied from very bland to very good. In the Asian section:  Pad Thai noodles were dry and no sauce; Orange Chicken was alright; Egg Rolls - alright; Hot & Sour soup - awful flavor; Egg Drop soup - good.  In the Italian section -  Chicken Cacciatore - good; Italian Meat Balls - great; marinara sauce - very good; Bolognese sauce -  very good; Scampi pasta - good.  American food section:  Stuffing - bland; Black Eyed - peas - bland; Macaroni & Cheese - bland; Collard Greens - bland....where's the ham hock flavor?  Popcorn Shrimp with horseradish sauce - very good; Minestrone Soup - very good.  Desert section:  Peach Cobbler - alright but where's the Carmel Sauce?  Aileen"}
{"text":"Wow! Nicest buffet I've ever been to. Massive, gorgeous and clean.   The staff is very attentive- our glasses were never empty.   It was a bit pricey but I believe that was because it was a Friday \"Prime Rib Night.\" After tax and gratuity the total was $22.   The selection was great and the food was all very fresh. Hot items were hot, cold items were cold -- no room-temperature sketchy foods here!   A pleasant surprise and nice find."}
{"text":"This buffet has been featured on buzzfeed worth it, and I'd say it's nothing it says it is on the video! Let's start with the price, non members were not only 8.99 but total for two non members for breakfast was $45! Disappointing but moving on to the food! Now they have a few stations starting from Asian fusion to Mexican to American to Italian to desserts. The food were not that great! I've had better and cheaper. I wouldn't come here again even if they offered a special price or anything. Just overall disappointed. Not worth the price either."}
{"text":"Great service. The cashier advised me to sign up for a Player's Card so I could save $5 on my Saturday night dinner. (This came in handy later!) and Douglas, seeing that I was dining solo, was kind enough to hold my table so I could use the restroom which is located outside of the restaurant, during my meal. The selection of food is unbelievable, and Saturday nights are Prime Rib night, too. Asian, Italian, Mexican, Salad, Desserts -- It was very hard for me to stick to my 2 plate rule at this buffet! The service and offerings of this restaurant was very much in alignment with the rest of the hotel, A++ and I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"We ate here at different mealtimes to see how the food was. The salad/fruit bar was AMAZING. The pastries and BBQ was also great. The Asian counter was iffy and the food was dry. The lines get long at prime hours, so eat breakfast early or dinner early to avoid the rushes. Overall, not a bad value at ALL for the food and the variety."}
{"text":"I've recently moved to Vegas, and live very close to the Red Rock Casino. I have been to this buffet for about 4 times last week, overall, not impressed.   Yes, it is cheap and close by, but the food quality is pretty low. Sushi is inedible (if you've ever had ok sushi), a lot of breakfast dishes were very cold, asian station is way too greasy. I mean, it's ok for what you pay for, but I think the buffet at Palms for the same price is a lot better.   The only thing I enjoyed was their bakery/desert station. I like they have a big variety of low sugar/ sugar free items. The banana cream pie was tasty."}
{"text":"Red Rock Feast buffet is pretty darn good!   I am always satisfied with the fresh selection of buffet items. They have the basics, the classics and build your own creation stations such as tacos, omelets, and pasta.   Fresh sliced meat options, turkey, roast beef, prime rib and ham.   They also have shrimp cocktail, simple sushi, salad bar, soups, breads, pizza, enchiladas, fish & chips just to name a few.   Desserts are incredible, cakes, pies, gelato, soft serve, cookies, macaroons, etc.   Drinks anything you could imagine from chocolate milk, lemonade, coffee, iced tea, and sodas.   The lay out is comfortable, spacious with both booths and table seating.   The service is always fantastic, the servers always keeping our drinks filled.   Great food, wonderful service and fantastic deals with a players card for comped or two for one deals.   I have done this buffet many times and will continue to do it every time I am in the mood to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Up there (or down there )with Circus Circus in terms of just bad.  I could come up with more adjectives,but bad just the right description.  I went to pay with a roll of quarters from the Palace Station and the cashier actually counted them one by one.  Bad service,bad food ,bad atmosphere.  Get it ?Just bad.  Strange though,the Sunset Station Palace Feast buffet is actually decent and edible."}
{"text":"Decent buffet,but lines can exceed 40 or 50 people on a weekday at 1 PM.  It's not the Bellagio and I'm not going to wait 45 minutes for a mediocre buffet."}
{"text":"We like this buffet cuz my hubby always gets buy 1 get 1 free with his taxi id and with our daughter that's 3 is also free; makes it an awesome price for the three of us.  Food is good for our price."}
{"text":"I like this buffet. A good selection of food. But I love the baked sea bass in a lemon cream sauce. They have a great Mongolian BBQ section where they will grill  Korean BBQ ribs for you with the marinade of your choice. Great dessert bar with gelato, sundaes, smoothies and a variety of cakes. A great deal if you have the membership card ( Free)."}
{"text":"This review is based off of lunch time.  Food 3/5 The food items that I grabbed were pretty tasty, fried rice was good and the sweet and sour pork was great too. There were some items though that were off putting some of the soups looked a little funky and the sauce next to the fried rice was down right scary. The sauces and the soups made me think that they were sitting for a very long time.   Service - The table was kept clear and drinks were refilled without having to speak up, so that's good for a buffet.  Parking - Multi story parking garage with a short walk through the casino   All in all this was a decent buffet if you factor in the price of $10.99 per person if you have a rewards card which you can sign up pretty quickly. If we paid full $15.99 per person I'd honestly say to skip this place."}
{"text":"My bill was $5.39!!!!!  Five dollas yo!!  What what!!! That being said food was typical buffet.  There is an omlette station. I had two eggs over medium (not that u might care.)  There are also ample desserts.   The cheap meal almost made me forget that they charge a $15 resort fee at the palace station and my room doesn't have a tub. If it wasn't for my quest to try other places I would make sure that I ate my resort fee in bacon! Mmmm bacon.  Pigs are magical!  I have ADD. Oh look,......stickers!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best buffet I've been to.  The crab legs are very fresh and plentiful.  The staff would refill them when the pan got down to the last quarter or so, which was impressive.  In my mind, it's worth $20 just for AYCE eat snow crab!    Everything else I tried was tasty too.  I really liked the mini crab cakes, mac & cheese and salad bar.    I didn't even venture to the international stations, so I can't commit on the Asian or Mexican varieties.    The ice cream bar was a nice touch.  Limited toppings though: m&ms, chocolate sauce, nuts, etc.  But the ice cream itself was nice and soft!  The other desert options were typical buffet style: lots of cakes."}
{"text":"You can't ever argue with buffets. Tons of variety at a lower rate. This place is awesome the food is always fresh and the customer service is on point. Drinks are always flowing so I have nothing negative to say. ... maybe a veteran discount."}
{"text":"Came here a few years ago and it was AWESOME. Delicious, fresh, no complaints at all. Came back more recently and.. it's changed. Less fresh. Not great. Pretty bland. It was a pretty big let-down. However, service is great and it's very clean. I just wish the food was not sitting out as long and not as cheap tasting as it is now."}
{"text":"It's a hit or miss.  I would have easily given this place 4 stars during my first visit for lunch, but when I came back for dinner just a week ago, it was lacking.    The last time, we had fresh fish fillets, wok fried with no batter in the Asian section.  This time, there's battered fish with nasty sweet and sour sauce.  It looked like stuff that would be served at fast food joints, sitting under heat lamps.   The Mongolian grill is okay.  You put together a variety of vegetables and pick your meat of your choice for the chef to grill up.  They're heavy handed on the oil and soy sauce, so I suggest you put your own sauce.  They are busy and rush through the process, so this is not always the best option.  My dish was overly salty and and I'm sorry that I had to waste good shrimp.  The dessert section carried a variety of carrot cake, pecan pie, peach cobblers and my ultimate favorite, anything chocolate cake."}
{"text":"since 2/27/2011  We always go with our rewards card its only 8.99 for dinner and drinks are only 3 bucks and they always load it up with booze, from the bottle not cheap tap liquor either, it's the best! Their selection is great, their ceasar salad dressing is my favorite and their asian curry noodles and pad thai and dumplings are great! Their decor is really nice and modern too. Service is good. Love it! We are regulars! I can't think of anywhere else I would bother to go. Only thing is its smoky in the casino so your hair ends up smelling like smoke, make sure you have time to shower otherwise you are going to bed with smoky hair!"}
{"text":"Tons of selection, piping hot, so hot the tongs are too hot to touch. Their price is really cheap for the huge selection, everything tasted good. Their chicken mushroom alfredo was my favorite as you could really taste their mushroom sauce, their spaghetti marinara was really tasty, their chinese sesame balls were the best, just like dim sum but hot and tasty, in perfect shape even after sitting for a long time! Their fried gyoza dumplings were perfect, spiced just right, great asian flavor, even their spring rolls were great with tons of tasty meat. Their guacamole was fabulous and their ice cream was really smooth and delicious. Would definitely come back, the price is right, the atmosphere asian style and comfortable, I didn't want to leave. Staff were very nice and overall great for the price!"}
{"text":"Nice selection at this buffet. The price always fluctuates (some months it's 2 for 1). I dined on a Monday at 5 pm and used a comp. The price with Boarding Pass was $12.99, and there wasn't a wait.  The most memorable items I had were cream of broccoli soup, mozzerella & tomato salad , fried shrimp and pretzel rolls. The pretzel rolls are seasonal items for Oktoberfest. There are stations with American, Asian, Italian and Mexican food. The cold salads have a great variety also, including Caesar and spring lettuce w/ cranberries, walnuts, & bleu cheese.  Desserts include the standard pies & cakes, and a variety of ice cream. The bread pudding is a standout."}
{"text":"GAAAAAROSS!! I've been coming here once a week for the past 7 months. The food never changes, taste has been getting worse and what sealed the deal was Christmas Eve Buffet, totally disappointing! Everything I ate tasted nasty. Prime rib was fatty, Turkey was dry, Asian food had a plastic taste. Udon broth was sweet. Dessert had a chemical taste, I had to spit it out. The only bright side is, they have an excellent waiter named Alberto. If you should try the buffet as your last resort, ask for Alberto you won't regret it. (He works breakfast and Lunch)"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service! Prompt attention to the customer's needs.  Food is great especially for a buffet."}
{"text":"Okay since I've been staying at the hotel I was hungry for lunch and with a $7.99 price I thought why not. So I had the roasted and fried chicken it was OK but not all that. The pizza was very salty so we're the mashed potatoes. I tried the Brussel sprouts and they lacked seasoning.  Everything I tried was mediocre and there was a limited selection for lunch. Definitely not trying this place again, you're better off eating at the grand cafe"}
{"text":"* $9 for lunch (save $1 with your Boarding Pass)  Station Casinos is playing a game of good property/bad property at the corner of Lake Mead and Rancho in North Las Vegas.   You have the grim, rundown Fiesta and the reasonably appealing Texas across the street. Why would anyone go to the Festival Buffet at the Fiesta when you have The Feast Buffet at Texas Station right across the street?  To offer something for everyone, they also have the Wildfire, a junior casino across Rancho. They are your full-service casino company.  The Feast buffet is a spacious, attractively appointed feeding venue. The lighting and design are pleasing.  Of course, they blast you with stun tunes but somehow it's not so bad here.  The first thing you notice:  real dishes.  Not like the Festival Buffet with their plastic discs.  Feeding statons include Bayou Country, American Favorites (beef brisket and turkey breast carvings), Italian, Chinese, barbecue, pizza, salad bar, salsa bar, and Mexican, where the guy will fry up your beef or chicken fajitas. ($1 tip suggested.)  Most of what I sampled was tasty, except (not good): chow mien noodles, mac & cheese, fried catfish. Don't bother with the salad bar.  I didn't try it because it looks just like a dreadful Sizzler salad bar.  The Bayou Country feeding station features steamed crawfish.  As a service to my readers, I ate two of them.  They're just little critters and a chore to peel (picture posted). It would take several to make a mouthful.  The guys behind the counter said to eat only the tail, not the body, although that has meat too.  They look something like a microscopic lobster. They have creepy little centipede legs and long feelers that poke out of their head. They're kind of tasty, not like a shrimp or a lobster either.    Being a country boy, crawfish are nothing new to me.  Just the eating part. We used to catch \"crawdads\" as we called them by sticking a lump of bread to a string.  You lowered the lump of bread into a stagnant pond.  For some reason, the crawdads would grab onto the string.  We pulled 'em up out of the water and kept them as pets until they died in a few days.  The Feast Buffet is pretty nice.  It just misses being as good as the Rampart buffet because they didn't have anything like the tasty salmon offered at the Rampart.  The Feast had those shriveled filets of Tilapia."}
{"text":"Wow....talk about bang for your buck!!  I paid $13 for the lunch buffet here on a Sat afternoon, and considering ALL THE FOOD OPTIONS, I was not disappointed! I mean, it's no Wynn or Wicked Spoon, but it's also like 1/3 of the price of any buffet on the strip.  The food is really fresh, and I really enjoyed the multitude of BBQ porks/meats, which were cooked very well. Things I def recommend:  +Sopas (like a mexican flat tostada) +BBQ section +Asian noodles and BBQ pork bun +Mac n Cheese +PIE + gelato +Fruit  I was not that impressed with the Italian section as a whole, but otherwise, this place is legit, esp if you're hungry :) Drink service was a little slower than I'd like, but all in all, a good buffet!"}
{"text":"For the price you pay, it's a great buffet for what you get. Sure the selection is not the best and it's a 15 minute drive from the Strip but it's all worth it.  You grab a plate of crab legs and they saute it for you with tomatoes, garlic, butter, onions and chili. This is the best part and crab legs are addictive as Hell!  The Mongolian grill was great as well. You can choose between beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, Korean ribs, or seafood. There are an abundance of sauces to choose from as well.  Prime rib was above average. The dessert selection was limited but delicious.  If you have access to a car in Vegas, next time save yourself some dough and enjoy this underrated buffet."}
{"text":"I came here for the weekend brunch (8 dollars with my boarding pass discount).  This buffet was the worst I've been at in Vegas.  First of all, my taco shells were stale!  It tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for days!  I went to the egg station where I witnessed the egg cook make dozens of mistakes and discarded half a dozen eggs. After what felt like twenty minutes with three other people in front of me, I asked for poached eggs but the cook told me they didn't have an egg poacher and offered me steam eggs instead.  A few minutes later, I received two runny undercooked steamed eggs.  I should have known this cook didn't know how to cook eggs since he kept asking the customers if the eggs looked cooked enough before he took them off the stove.   Most of the food were borderline edible and just plain bad.  The only things I liked here were their desserts (lemon meringue, cheese danish, etc.).  It's just a shame that the people who run this buffet doesn't care or know what good food is.  It also appears that the staff is overworked.  For example, there should have been two egg cooks.  This buffet makes me think twice about returning to the Palace station hotel because I don't like paying for food cooked with no love or experience.  Don't come here, save your money."}
{"text":"Pretty average. Italian meatballs and desserts are good here, most everything else is average buffer fare. Prices are always cheaper if you have a casino rewards card, which are free to get so there is no reason to pay extra. Just go to the casino's card services near the food court and get a free card."}
{"text":"The selection is International, and the quality makes you want to travel elsewhere!    The price point is fair for the all-you-can-eat, they have pie (a bonus!), but the overall quality is equivalent to a cheap buffet.  With that said, that is what this is!  I've been a couple of times at lunchtime for convenience sake, and it's not busy...so it's easy in/out.  But my suggestion, especially if you are vacationing in Vegas and can choose anywhere to eat...choose somewhere else!"}
{"text":"The price is really a great value here.  Whether I've dined alone, or brought out-of-towners with me, everyone loves the quality and selection for the price.  True, there are better buffets offered at some of the hotels on the strip -- but add that the parking at the Red Rock is plentiful and convenient, smallish wait (10 mins mostly) to get in line and seated - and a great price; it's a no brainer.  Depending on breakfast/lunch/dinner - the selections vary, of course.  I recommend coming at a tweener time (ie. 1015am; 4pm) so you get some of the breakfast and then some of the lunch, some of the lunch and then some of the dinner items. You'll also find the wait line is less.  They offer about 8 stations of food: sushi/shrimp/(crab legs@dinner); mexican items; chinese/japanese hot items; american fare; carving station; italian/pizza/pastas (omelet station@breakfast); pie/cake; ice cream parlour and self-serve; and a large center area for salads/olives/cheeses/cold cuts/soups (bagels/toast@breakfast).   The host and hostess are always super friendly, and many of the servers are just terrific.    I've eaten here at Red Rock Buffet -- 20+ times...yeah, that would likely qualify me as a fan.  I also will add that I gained 20 lbs in about 18 months with eating like that!"}
{"text":"not bad! i wasn't wowed by this buffet, but wasn't disappointed either.   their salad bar was awesome.  i loved their fried chicken, mash potatoes and green beans.  my son had the same thing along with battered (popcorn) shrimp, since i made his plate.  he ate so much!   i don't wish i wasn't pregnant, but i wish i had an appetite and no aversions to certain food.  i would've had 3 plates+ and definitely would've had them make me a burger and some pasta.  i love that they had lots of fruits.  i went for ice cream, but totally avoided the rest of the desserts.   i would return!  lots of locals go to palace station which is nice and it's not so crowded."}
{"text":"there's really nothing that's special about this buffet when compared to others, but it's my favorite.  i love it!  my trip isn't complete without brunch here.    the line to get in is always long.  somehow my uncle always gets us in really quick.  he tells us to go straight up front. we've never had to wait longer than two minutes.    service is good. the waiters/waitresses are super nice and check on you often, but not to where you feel you don't have privacy and it's bothersome.    75% of what i grab is breakfast. i love breakfast! their omelets are the bomb.  their chinese food is pretty tasty too.  i load up on salad here. pasta is good.  super stringy cheesy pizza.  mmm yum.  i never pass on their gelato bar.  i grab several flavors at a time.  i just discovered their brownies. they have nice crisp edges and center is so moist.    you can stay here all day if you wanted to.  i never have though!"}
{"text":"Zero stars  Sorry the program won't let me review without stars.  Should be zero  Bbq night save your time and money not different than other nights!  Hardly any bbq meats Unpeeled shrimp and lots of canned food poured into nice plates."}
{"text":"Food salty cold and takes long time for adding to empty trays and just most side dishes gets transferred from cans ... into the display plate dishes...refill drinks only if you asked for...  used to be a nice local place and Will not try to come back"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor go elsewhere  Saturday night we got in at 8pm  Food is not replenished where the tray is empty No quality or service to rave about came with friends and by at the moment they closed at 9pm ;  No last call warning all food at the stations was trashed  Including the dessert station.  Definitely will not recommended for future visits"}
{"text":"Customer service from cashier to this restaurants 'executive chef ' is not at par by all means. Please have them take grade school all over. Non of the employees have communication manners between themselves or with customers. This place with their pretending executive chef just  ruined my dining experience."}
{"text":"I like this place. The setting is enticingly romantic, nice and dark.  it is great for locals and the price is right! Food is good, but I can cook better. Service is always spectacular. I really enjoy the cheese enchiladas, but they don't serve them often enough. I was super super super excited over the Italian Linguini! I just wanted more and more. I do recommend this place and the line is long but a short wait. That's why it is called, \"The Feast Buffet\"."}
{"text":"This my overall best buffet in Las Vegas. Its because of its offerings. I love Asian cuisines and this buffer gets it right. They do the recipe justice where a dedicated Chinese restaurant does not.  There are plenty of desserts but the one that stands out the most is my favorite Italian ice cream called Gelato. There are wide range of flavors to choose from. Another is Unlimited Beer and Wine for $5.99 additional to your buffet price is what seals the deal. Then they are open late night from 10pm to 8am. Red Rock Feast Buffet wins undisputed."}
{"text":"I recently went to the Buffet again for Breakfast and haha my inlaws got us the buffet breakfast here for can you believe it $2.99 because they used points and got it half off. Now for even the regular price it was a good deal for the items you get. Granted it isn't the full line up like lunch or dinner but freshly carved Turkey and Ham and Omelets made to order just those two things make it worthwhile. Then you can get your Bacon, Waffles, chicken, fruits and many other things to make you happy. I think I love Vegas more for the Cheap Food than anything else (cause I never win big)"}
{"text":"It was my very first Vegas buffet experience and I absolutely loved it! The place is huge and it is devided in several sections with different types of cuisine ( Italian, Japanese, Mexican, American ecc.) I tried a little bit of everything and yes, it's high quality buffet food. There are also a lot of salads and a very big fruit section for those who want to be on a light side. The service is very good too, our waitress came up several times to fill up out glasses with fresh soda. The price is really good too. Keep an eye on happy hour and week days specials."}
{"text":"Loved the food and service thanks lady's you are what makes going out to eat enjoyable"}
{"text":"I have been to this buffet on several occasions.   The food is ok, but I'm not really a big fan of buffets. The only thing I like about them is the endless choices of beverages and a plethora of dessert options, two things I usually don't order when I go to a regular sit down restaurant.   I came here for my friend's rehearsal dinner and they were very good about accomodating such a large group of people. The service was good and it's a good option when you have a huge group of people with different food preferences, so I would highly recommend this place for larger groups as well.   All in all, it's a pretty good buffet for the price, if you're into that sort of thing. =)"}
{"text":"I could have sworn I wrote a review for this place before. I can't say I'm a fan of this buffet, or any buffet really, but I do get dragged here from time to time and since it's not too expensive, I don't put up much of a fight.   The food is very basic and I often can't find too much that I actually want to eat. On busier days, they don't seem to replace the food as often as they should and there are often empty pans sitting there for longer than they should. Spills all over and lots of reaching over food in the front to get to the back items. Not very hygienic in my opinion, but maybe I'm just overly sensitive to stuff like that.  Service is friendly and they do keep up with drink refills and can handle larger parties easily."}
{"text":"They have standard fair, no standouts as far as I can recall. The prices seem pretty reasonable for a buffet of this caliber, though. It can get a tad busy on weekends, so be prepared to stand in line for a bit if you pick a popular time to come.   No standouts, beyond the quesadillas and Asian station. Just basic items to be had here. The layout is pretty good, but I would prefer more booth options. All in all, just an all right dining experience."}
{"text":"Our favorite buffet in Las Vegas!!  The quality of the food is outstanding  for the price you pay.  Make sure you and everyone in your party over age 18 have your player's card before getting to the register.  The buffet prices are a couple dollars lower when you sign up at Red Rock Casino's player club for their free player's card.  With the card, prices are $6.99 for breakfast and $8.99 for lunch.  Sunday through Thursday, the dinner buffet is $13.99 with the player's card.  Friday nights are $24.99.  Saturday nights are $16.99.  Personally, my favorite meal to eat here is Lunch!  We try to get here either early or late for lunch so that the wait is not longer than 20 minutes.  Still, if the wait was over an hour, it would be worth it to me.  For the price it costs (with a player's card), the Feast Buffet at Red Rock Casino is absolutely the best in Vegas!  Tip:  If you are a dessert lover (like me), then make sure to save room for dessert!  There are so many exceptional choices!  The majority taste just as good as they look!"}
{"text":"I can see why their buffet is a bit more than most. The restaurant setup is more well done then others. The food is a lot fresher here as well. I totally loved the cheesecake shooters! I indulged and had more than 1..2...3...4...ok don't judge but it didn't stop there! Servers were very nice and observant. Dirty plate moved to the side, was gone in a quick second. They had a mix of different cuisines that looked scrumdiddlyumpcious so deciding on what to start with was a bit difficult. They have a huge salad section in the middle of the restaurant! This place was huge as well!"}
{"text":"Don't let the pretty decor fool you. This place is mediocre compared to the other station buffets I've been too. First thing that I took notice of is the common sense of the staff people. have. The hostess seated us all the way in the back near the wall, but to get there I had to squeeze through other people's chairs with my baby's stroller, ram people in the foot, apologize and manuver through tables. All that and there were open tables up front? Stoopid! Secondly, some of the other restaurant patrons here are rude. They stare you down as you obtain your food or hover right behind you...gross. Next we have the eggs benedict setup, one of my favs! But wait, they've already topped it with the hollaindaise sauce? Yuck, so I get a mushy eggs benedict. When I returned to my table, I found an OJ waiting for me, which was great considering I had a plate full of food that would need to be washed down. Took a sip and blargh! It wasn't just sour, but it tasted nothing like OJ! It was like they mixed it with a secret ingredient that I couldn't even place...All in all, don't think I'd come back here, unless I had no choice."}
{"text":"We went on Sunday July 2. Waited in line which is to be expected. We got charged a holiday price, not sure why.  But just paid it because we had waited a while in line.  This buffet seems to have gotten worse in my opinion.  There was a bowl for mashed potatoes that was empty for at least 15-20 minutes. The chicken had some burned skin and the pieces were not recognizable, my piece had very little  meat, tried the ham and it was very dry . At the salad bar there were no plates. I was totally unhappy with my experience at this buffet. It just seems as if the quality of food as gone down."}
{"text":"I came for lunch today with my husband and toddler before our movie at the Regal Theater at Red Rock and was pleasantly surprised.  We signed up for the \"Boarding Pass\"  upon entering the hotel, so we could get the discount and pay only $6.99 each (drinks included), our toddler was free.  So, the value alone is 5 stars in my book!  We came right around noon on a Monday and waited in line for 30 minutes.  I've waited longer in other buffets on the Strip, so this didn't bother me at all.  The casino is new enough that it still has the clean and fresh feeling- and you don't feel like you are standing in a haze of second hand smoke.   There is definitely something for everyone.  They do not have the buffet staples of crab legs and shrimp cocktail- but they do have chinese, mexican, american, italian, and japanese.  These were just \"OK\" for me.    But, the salad bar is one of the larger ones I have seen with a great selection of fruits, veggies, and potato and macaroni salads.  The dessert selection is also quite plentiful.  They don't have chocolate covered strawberries or fancy looking pastries, but they do have 15 different types of pies, including reduced sugar options. They also have other pastries, cupcakes, eclairs, gelato, soft serve ice cream, and cookies (of which I pocketed a few for a movie snack).    I wouldn't recommend driving out of your way to eat at this buffet, but if you are in the area, checking out a movie, or planning on bowling- then it is DEFINITELY worth it.  Since we live only 15 minutes away and we like the stadium style movie theater- we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worst then ever. Like dog food. Hate it but my 87 year old mom insists I take her there. YUCK!!!! Take some pride in your food Santa Fe."}
{"text":"This is not all it's praised to be. Small, not the best selections; food was ok, nothing spectacular. You can hardly see or talk to the chefs cause the glass around the buffet is too high. No prime rib & the beef they did have was bland. Very clean though, good wait staff; but not worth the price w/out a Players card. No hurry to come back."}
{"text":"This is the worst buffet I have been to, everything was fine and dandy until a huge cockroach fell onto my hand as I was making my plate. I shook it off and immediately told management they needed to switch the food out, as I asked my my money back. This place is roach infested don't go if you value your health. If you see one roach you know there are thousands more. This place ruined buffets for me, I haven't been to a buffet since! I would have given it now stars, but it forces you to select a star before moving forward."}
{"text":"They really are trying....  It's a buffet that's not like the Terribles resort and not the Studio B!  Not to say that Terribles buffet is bad as it has some great examples of common food (killer brisket) in a much smaller space, and even Studio B has some misses, but the Feast buffet has been trying to improve its menu and raise the bar for the price.  Way way better than the Hometown Buffatorium!!!!  Prices are now smarter and easy on the budget, and while no changes have been made to the physical area, the foods are different. For breakfast you still have a long line at the omelette station and there's a lot more choices to make throughout. One interesting choice is a breakfast pizza with egg, cheese and basil!  Kids love this one!  My favorite was the chicken fried steak with country gravy... every time they had it, I would serve it on my plate .... Mmmmmm.  Eggs Benedict with the hailendaise sauce separate is a good thing cause you can soak your hashies & piggies if you want instead.  Bacon is king here and there is plenty but I like it limp so too Krispy for my taste.    Lunch and brunch fits better with much more different foods & the carving station has many more choices of meats, and throughout there are more different choices Of deliciousness, with a few hits and misses. Tater tots was one of the biggest hits, as as soon as it was served hot it would vanish and they would have to bring out more where it would vanish again. Same thing for any of the hot pizzas, especially if there were little ones in the dining room, as they would take multiple slices to the table.   The omelette station becomes a pasta station for lunch & dinner.  the carving station in addition to its offerings can grill you your burger, dogs, sausage, roast chicken half, or even add cheese & grill your onion rounds on request!!! One serious miss from lunch to dinner was this one I will call Dead Greek pasta salad, as this salad has a pasta that had died years ago... The pasta was simply dried out and dead of flavor whatsoever... None of the feta, tomato or spices could penetrate that pasta. They kept serving it daily to get rid of it or are displaying it daily like a viewing of a corpse!   Sunday brunch was also Mimosa day and many times the mimosas kept flowing, but remember many of the servers wouldn't offer it... You would have to ask for it and when you did they would bring it and bring it and bring it is long as you kept asking for it.  Many nights dinner was a theme night, which made dinner different from lunch, yet there were some dinner foods that were the same as lunch. There  would always be classics, like fried chicken, mashed potatoes, burgers, hot dogs, pizza, salads things like that regardless of theme and the one item I rate most buffets on... And it hold true every time; THEIR STUFFING!  At one time it used to be a wet, kinda gooey mess, but now it's a nice, homemade style stuffing chopped bread stuffing that is very nice.    WARNING.... Like most buffets, turkey served in buffets is white meat heaven.  Dark meat consists of usually only the leg.  Asking for dark meat sometimes means they give you the whole leg!  Be prepared for that fact... And be hungry  Desserts were typical pre made but many were different from the ones they had from previous stays even 3 months prior!  Many more lighter fare, doughnut holes, jellos & a way bigger sugar free dessert area.  They also added sugar free sherbets along with the frozen yogurt offerings. I had the raspberry (very sweet) & fresh peach (very good!!!!).  Fresh fruit was available too.  Service is great for the most part, even exceptional but every once in a while you get a crabby patty... You will get service, but not the great service Palace Station is known for (they really do treat you like a local friend!).  Come early cause it can & does get crowded & join their rewards club for a discount & comp'ed meals with play. Handicapped guests have their own line with their party.    My review is for a 4 day stay, 4 different meal services (breakfast, lunch, Sunday brunch & dinner) & 1 dead salad.   FYI: They only offer Tabasco for hot sauce Review score was more a 3.9 but they are really trying.... Please give that salad a decent burial in the desert somewhere.... Please!!!"}
{"text":"I love this buffet at Boulder Station. I am disabled, however, and appreciated their special handicapped line. They recently force you to merge yourself in with the regular line (always very busy). It's very embarrassing and uncomfortable as I have to explain ti the healthy people why I am cutting in. I would go back if they revert to the special handicap line but not until then.   UPDATE- they changed and went back to the separate handicapped line.  So I go again !!"}
{"text":"Good quality and tasty food.  I love the real mashed potatoes with the skins mixed in.  The fried chicken is awesome and the only time I allow myself to eat fried chicken. The Ambrosia Salad as well as the Sweet & Sour soup are delicious.  Also, the dessert bar offers sugar free and no sugar added pies which I appreciate.  The pizza isn't the best but then who goes to a buffet for the pizza? I love the Red Rock Casino Feast Buffet."}
{"text":"Not the best buffet in Las Vegas but not the worst either. For the past few times I've been here I don't think there has been much of a variety from any of the food. Always the same thing for breakfast, lunch, dinner. Once in a while, I'll see something different but nothing out of the ordinary for me.   The flavors of most of the food are okay to say the least. Very basic but it does the job! For station casinos and for the price, I'm very much satisfied. So if you're ever on a budget and needed to show off a little extra Vegas flare, this is the place to go.   The service is always on point here. I've never had issues with any server taking too long to grab my drinks. For the amount of traffic, that is quite impressive. But waiting in line to get in is a bit annoying. There's always a line so don't come here super hungry. Always plan ahead!   Also, get a casino players card to get the discounts! I promise it would be worth it."}
