{"text":"Fresh and excellent food.   Service was great too.   I don't think there was msg in food which is a huge plus.   I would recommend."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese food in town!!! Friendly service, clean restaurant, and most especially AMAZING food!! Ask for the chili oil to add to your pho base...YUMMOLAS!!!!"}
{"text":"Do not recommend come here for food. Food is super slow and service is bad. Dont let the photo trick you, the food is alot less and different from the photos..."}
{"text":"Excellent service. We ordered banh khot, canh chua and ca kho to. They were very homemade tasting. No MSG nor grease. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Expert staff, quick, and easy on the eyes ;)  seriously good service.  Pho was delicious and we have great pho to compare to in our home town. Looking forward to the next visit!  

Very nice people run this restaurant.  They will go above and beyond to make your dining experience memorable"}
{"text":"This was the worst Pho ever!
I always trust yelp when I travel to new places and never been disappointed but this one did.
Pho has No flavor at all."}
{"text":"BEST pho in Vegas I have ever tasted. Very clean and has the \"feel at home\" ambience.  Meals are budget friendly and bursting with flavor. Come in hungry and go home happy."}
{"text":"I cannot tell you what makes a good pho good, but I can definitely tell a bad pho from the first sip of the soup. The soup at Pho Lan is authentic with no taste of msg. It is fresh and light. For the price, it is not a huge portion, but it is pretty tasty. I will come back if I ever crave for pho again when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Pho broth was clean, NO MSG, and the noodles/herbs were fresh. Some people might think that the broth is bland , but that may be because they are so use to the overload of salt and MSG..  I also ordered the mini bun xeo pancakes appetizer which was tasty.

Really great hidden mom and pop joint. EXCELLENT SERVICE! :) Go support them!"}
{"text":"We are very satisfied with the food and service. Unlike most authentic Vietnamese restaurants, the service is really good. Our food came great tasting and timely. The restaurant is all clean and pleasant. We will definitely come back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great service and food 
The fried chicken wings were awesome
Had egg appetizer was crispy and great flavor!  I never had it before it was real good"}
{"text":"We tried the bun bo hue and pho dac biet. I just moved to Las Vegas last month, and I am happy that I found a good place to have good Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"I had the vegan Pho with vegetables and  tofu, $8.95 Lots of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, all veggies where al dente. I like the plain tofu, refreshing and healthier that the deep fried. The vegan broth was perfectly seasoned. The walls are decorated with lovely colored photograph of orchids.  The women's bathroom was very clean. The friendly staff can speak English well."}
{"text":"Went here for our last dinner in Vegas before heading back to the Bay Area.
Quality of food was decent. Here's our order for that night.
- Spring roll appetizer - average due to the wrap being chewy (probably not freshly wrapped)
- Chicken wing appetizer - pretty good, worth a try
- Rice plate with bbq pork, shredded pork, grilled shrimp - liked the pork and grilled shrimp
- Bun Bo Hue - pretty good, decent soup base
- Shaken beef rice plate - Beef is not tender (not recommended)
- Combination Beef Pho - Decent with a good soup base
Service was prompt and attentive.

---Here is the LOSS of 2*s
1. Water was horrible! DO NOT drink their water. Its not filtered and smelled like a swimming pool with too much chlorine
2. Portions - as i mentioned earlier, food QUALITY is there, portions are way too small. Need 2 orders to fill you up or maybe we are just used to the larger portion sizes in the Bay Area.

Probably will try another vietnamese restaurant next time I'm in Vegas for comparison."}
{"text":"The ambience was extremely akward, it was so damn quiet, all you hear is the annoying veitnamese pop music. When I leave a resturant I expect to be full and I wasnt even close to that. The menu pictures are extemely decieving. We ordered #5 and it was filled with red onions and vegetables and minimal pieces of meat, basically a mouthful of nothing but the picture clearly depicted a salad filled with beef. All the meat tasted like it was frozen. A lot of reviewers are saying  that the bun bo hue was extremely good, I could not disagree more. It was not even spicy and the broth tasted exactly like the pho broth-pathetic! Portion sizes do not reflect prices either, other vietnamese portions are twice as much for the same price. Our final bill totaled almost 100 bucks and we were all still starving. Also be ready to pay 15% gratuity, so basically an extra 10 bucks. I definitely wont be coming back. The lone star is for the attentive waiters who do a great job."}
{"text":"The food was great. The service was very friendly. You should stop by Pho lan when your in town."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!! This is not your usual westernized Vietnamese cuisine, its definitely more traditional. They should definitely have more photos of the food to identify with but otherwise everything's great. I cannot stress enough how friendly the owners and staff are. I also screwed up my order twice I know it sounds wired but they remade it both times free of charge. Bubble tea is not powder made either. Fresh fruit. Delicious."}
{"text":"When I looked on yelp, this place had great reviews. I'd really been craving pho for some reason. Usually I'm not a fan of pho for some odd reason. This is located in an obscure area. It is away from the Chinatown mall right across I-Naba. I could not find the place. I was driving all across the parking lot before I finally decided to try around the corner and there it was! 

When we first went inside, we were the only people there. The server greeted us immediately and seated us. Their menu is not too extensive. They have drinks, noodles, and rice dishes. They had the pho broth noodles and also the ones without soup. I don't know what those are called. I was hoping they had Vietnamese sandwiches, but they did not. 

I ordered the number 9 and that was the pho noodles with beef brisket and flank I believe. They bring each person individual plates of bean sprouts, jalapenos, and basil. The broth tasted fine to me. The noodles were a little soft, and kind of broke apart. It might just be that I'm not so used to pho and that's how the noodles are. I feel like you can't really \"mess up\" pho, but that might be that my taste buds aren't that refined."}
{"text":"Stopped here on our way back from zion national park and it was the perfect meal! Wonderfully attentive service that really went above and beyond--even gave us water bottles for our car ride home to orange county. Learned that this is a family owned and run enterprise, which is always great. The pho was really delicious too, with clear broth that was the right amount of tasty. Not overly oily. I imagine this to be a great hangover place from a wild night in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Attentive and amicable service, aromatic and appetizing dishes, clean and comfortable setting (my baby could sleep through our entire meal without being disrupted by loud diners or harsh background music!), affordable prices. Will definitely be returning !"}
{"text":"Pho-get other restaurants, this place is a gem! Being my second time in LV I ventured off the strip and into Chinatown. Pho Lan is in the area but not in the hustle and bustle that is cramped parking lots and gaudy storefronts which is fine by me. 

I ordered my favorite - Hu tieu mi hoanh thanh kho. The mi is locally made and very fresh with a great bite to it. I love xa xiu and was pleased to find a generous portion in my dry soup. Overall I was very much satisfied!

Other things to point out:
- service: super friendly and helpful (I ordered off the menu)
- cleanliness: my oh my are they clean, bathrooms are immaculate 
- ambience: I enjoy the Vietnamese music videos, cheesy yet very entertaining!"}
{"text":"Good food, good pho, get the large bowl worth it. Friendly, great service and great people."}
{"text":"If you want superb ice coffee in Vegas on a hot day, Pho Lan is the place to be. Grown in Vietnam, it has a unique rich flavor you won't find at Peets or Starbucks. And the food won't disappoint either. Be sure to compliment the cook, who is the owner's mother. A family of four can eat for under $40."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Las Vegas from New York in June and have dined at several Vietnamese eateries in Las Vegas. I had been disappointed until I found Pho Lan, and I was starting to think that I would not find a restaurant that rivaled the one I was so fond of back home.Today my prayers were answered. I know, sounds corny but this place is that good. The atmosphere is charming, the restaurant clean and aesthetically pleasing, the service fast & friendly... And my bho kho, delicious, fresh and hot. The broth was amazing. The only draw back is that it's across town, but I can always move. Pho Lan is superior, and I am proud to be a loyal patron of this fine establishment!!! Can't wait to try the bun bo hue!"}
{"text":"Food was salty, service was OK. I only got 5 skimpy pieces of chicken in my pho ga. :("}
{"text":"The pancake thingee was amazing. Pho hit the spot. Nice. Clean. Delicious. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for some pho action in the Valley, I first saw this business pop up on the new business listing, but soon quickly disappeared. Later on, I saw one of my friends bookmark this place. Looking at the reviews, I was kind of surprised no elites had checked out this spot. Might as well take one for the team!

On the Yelp map, this location is pretty hard to find. Here is an easier way, just park in front of the I-Naba restaurant. It's right in front of that building. I thought they had been building up this spot for a long time.

Upon entering, it's a very well taken care of resto. It could be due to the fact that everything is brand new. There is plenty of seating, and it fits the bill of a pho restaurant. After ordering, the food came out in a reasonable time.

#7 - Pho Dac Biet (combination everything pho) - I thought that the broth was ok. It had a light beef flavor, while I prefer a more robust one, but it was good. They gave a lot of noodles, and they were properly prepared. The bean sprouts/Thai basil/jalapeño peppers were very fresh, and they gave a ton of bean sprouts. The meat was one of my favorite parts. The brisket was so good and had a real \"beefy\" flavor. The rare beef and meatball were very fresh and tasty as well. One criticism about this dish would be that I wish there was more meat. I thought they gave a fair amount of brisket, but they could have used a couple slices more of their rare beef, another meatball, more tripe, and more than just 1 tendon. Especially when After the yelp discount the total came out to 8.70, Yikes!!

The service was pretty good as well. The servers came around to make sure I had enough water at all times, and they even brought me some extra napkins without having me ask.

Even though I think it's a little bit more pricey than other pho joints, I thought the quality was pretty good. I still have my favorite spot, but this might be a possible replacement if my spot burns down or something. I wish they would give a little bit more of their fantastic meat, but ::shrugs::"}
{"text":"This review is based on their pho. Being that I am a friend of one of the employees, I got a tour of how they make their pho. I posted three photos from the kitchen (grilling onions, ingredients, and simmering pot). They use an assortment of beef and beef bones with the ingredients in the pictures. They told me it takes about 12 hours of simmering to make the soup. 

I have been to many pho places in LV and here in Colorado. It may be a subtle difference, but most pho places' soup base isn't as flavorful as the one I had at Pho Lan. After seeing how they make their soup base, I appreciate the food and their pho a lot more."}
{"text":"Had the Bun Bo Hue with spring rolls and a young coconut to drink.

The soup was delicious all normal condiments were provided and service was excellent! Their water has a secret in it that you just have to try. Very different from other restaurants but very delicious!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite place to eat pho.

Banh Khot... Vietnamese mini savory pancakes, so tasty!
Pho Tai Nam, beef noodle soup with rare steak and flank. The beef broth is very rich. Just don't forget to ask for cilantro, that is a must!
Bun Bo Nuong, grilled beef with vermicelli and vegetables. Grilled onion wrapped inside adds a little sweetness that complements the flavor - you wouldn't believe how tasty it is.
Com Suon Bi, or grilled pork chop with shredded pork skin and steamed rice.

Everything was great, no misses. We'll come back to try even more items!"}
{"text":"It is clean and new inside and the broth flavor is beefy and rich. But the meat (rare steak) tasted as if it was frozen or reheated. It didnt taste fresh like I've had before. 
Very nice customer service and happy that we tried it."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself was clean and peaceful after having a long night of partying it was nice to go to a place that wasn't loud and crowded with people like many other pho restaurants. I didn't mind that there was only one other table occupied by guests in the restaurant (usually when it's dead it's a warning sign to get outta there but not this place) because the pho was amazing and the spring rolls was freshly made plus the service was great. It's hard to receive great service from majority( when I say majority I mean like 99% of Vietnamese restaurants).Usually they just take your order , bring you water and your food and that's it. Both the servers made sure we were enjoying our food and filled our waters a few times ( which my husband liked, he hates having to ask for water since it's a given that you need water when it's empty and your chowing down on ice!) Whether it was because it wasn't busy or not it's always nice to have your servers treat you well and communicate with you."}
{"text":"Portions were really small. Food was bland. I usually get full from just eating an appetizer. I ate both app and entree and barely filled me up. Egg rolls were undercook because it's still pink on the inside so I decided to just give that to the dogs. This will be the first and the last time coming here. Maybe that's why only one table was filled and it was there own worker.. Haha! I'll stick to chinatown."}
{"text":"It seems there is an influx of pho restaurants in Vegas. Everyone has their own opinion about which one is best. With so many and some of the pho being similar or acceptable, what makes a place stand out? As customer service decreases and the price of everything increases, I am very wary with who I give my business to. Pho Lan has been my go-to spot and I will remain a loyal customer there. Not only is the pho delicious, but I was blown away by the customer service. I've never been treated so well at a pho place and found my new spot. They never let my water glass go empty (which is a common thing at other places) and are very welcoming. I was even there during a surprise visit by the health dept and they got their A. And now they will get my money for that delicious weekly bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Very good.  A clean place which seems to be run by a family and serves good food.  The meat was good and lean, and quite good, and the rolls and beef salad were also tasty.  Service was great, people were nice, food tasted great.  Not much more to say.  Super clean, including the bathroom as well, which is always a big plus.  Kind of tucked away in the NW corner of the shopping center at Decatur and Desert Inn, so hopefully they get enough business back there."}
{"text":"Bún bò hu is yummy. Highly recommended! Ph is good, too. They have great services, and the place is new & clean."}
{"text":"Ordered Pho with steak and meatballs. The soup was perfectly seasoned, smooth, and pleasant. I asked for egg noodle (yellow) instead of rice noodle (white) and It was great. The meat was portioned properly to the soup and noodle. If you like kick ask for the in-house made hot sauce. A great place for pho with awesome customer service."}
{"text":"There's good service at this place, however, it wasn't busy when I went. The restaurant is clean.

Now on to the food. Ordered bun bo hue, stirred fry noodles, and pho, all three are bland and there isn't enough seasoning. The portion is also a lot smaller than other Vietnamese restaurants. So, I would give this restaurant a pass since there are so many other better Vietnamese restaurant one or two streets over. Next!"}
{"text":"The spring rolls were exceptional, and the pho was out of this world. This place is worth the trip."}
{"text":"i went there expecting this restaurant to be better or the same as \"pho kim long\"..is not even in the same league. There's nothing special about this resturant the food is so-so..went in rush hour and the restaurant was empty, that was a sign I should have just walk out...Pho Kim Long still the best for pho and everything"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night and like many of these reviewers, we had an exceptional experience.

The restaurant is very welcoming, comfortable, and clean. They are a family-owned operation with excellent servers who are polite, friendly, and treated us very attentively. Business was slow when we came in for dinner last night, but I feel that we still would have received the same courteous treatment if that were not the case.

To be frank, I have been to several Vietnamese restaurants in town and the customer service has always felt below average. Conversely, the workers here really make an effort to take good care of their customers and it truly sets them apart from the competition. If you are looking for excellent customer service, this is the place to go!

Another thing that stands out about this restaurant is their well-curated menu. It has several vivid photos and just the right amount of options (in other words, it doesn't feel overwhelming to look at). We ordered thai tea, a shrimp pancake appetizer, and two entrees (pho and stir fried noodles). Prices are fair and everything looked and tasted very good. We would happily come back to support this lovely restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Plastic in the bubble teas, requested no cilantro yet it covered our meals and soup broth was like oil. Will never try again."}
{"text":"Friendliest waiter I've had in a while.  Mom is in the back cooking and has been cooking for her different restaurants for 20+ years.   

Pho was even complimented by my picky 8 & 12 year olds.  LARGE servings of pho and also noodle dishes."}
{"text":"We went here with my Dad when we were home for Christmas. Our waiter was awesome. He made recommendations and helped us order items other than pho. We got the beef salad as an appetizer and I'd seriously order that by itself. The beef was so tender and yummy. My husband got the meatball pho and he liked it, though he didn't finish his broth because he usually likes a side of white rice to help soak it up a little. 
We also got the spring rolls, and they were a little minty for me. I know that's a common Vietnamese flavor but sometimes it overpowering. That's just personal preference. We also tried the little shrimp pancakes and they were so awesome. 
My father and I got the beef plate with white rice. Again, the beef was tender and delicious and I cleaned my plate. Mom ordered the fried rice (she isn't very adventurous) and liked it. Love this place and we'll for sure be back when we are back in town!"}
{"text":"Happy to have found yet another pho place in Vegas to cure those cravings of real Asian food (and of course to cure those hangovers...)  Found this place on Yelp (of course) and made our way over after a shopping trip at the outlets.

This place is located in a large shopping plaza with a Smiths market.  If you are coming down Desert Inn, it will be on the far left side of the plaza.  Almost didn't find it.  Parking was easy and right outside the restaurant.  Was greeted and seated immediately.  Looking over the reviews and the menu, we ended up getting 2 bowls of pho (pho bo vien and pho dac biet), ca kho, nem nuong cuon, and banh khot.

My parents said that the broth for the pho was very tasty.  I didn't get a taste but they enjoyed it.  The only thing they also mentioned about it was there was less meat than expected.  I guess they are comparing it to the bowls we get here in LA where they pack so much meat that you sometimes can't even finish it.

I loved the banh khot.  8 mini dish sized pieces of banh xeo.  Very tasty with a large piece of shrimp on top.  It comes fish sauce which is also what you usually get when you order banh xeo.  The taste of the coconut comes through and is a definite must order.

I didn't try the nem nuong cuon but my parents said the nem nuong was very tasty and fresh.  They said it reminded them of the ones they used to get but couldn't find anymore.  They didn't like the sauce that came with it though.  They said it was pretty flavorless so they ended up dipping them in the nuoc mam that came with the banh khot.

I ordered the ca kho.  Stewed/Braised catfish in a clay pot.  SOOO full of flavor.  Comes with two slices of catfish and a side of rice.  It is a good amount and all your really need in this dish is the sauce anyways.  I can and did eat two bowls of rice just with the braising sauce.  The catfish was also very fresh and didn't have the usual \"muddy\" flavor that you sometimes taste when you order catfish.

The service here is great.  Very attentive and very friendly.  Feels family owned and to me, that's always a plus.  I actually went up to the counter to show them my Yelp Check In for a 10% of my check and the lady said Sorry to me for not coming to the table.  Totally not necessary because their service was on par.

I must try if you are willing to get away from the usual hustle and bustle of the Strip and the Chinatown plaza."}
{"text":"Authentic Vietnamese food! Great food and quick service. I like the attention to detail on their dishes...even down to the Cafe Su Da!"}
{"text":"This place is super clean, I know other reviewers mentioned it, but it's so clean that it actually stands out as soon as you walk in. Another reviewer said the pho portion was smaller than most, so I ordered the fried pork eggrolls as an appetizer. They were so delicious, but the pho was bigger than I expected, so I couldn't even finish it. Overall, service and food were great. Wait time was not long at all. I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were in the area looking for Pho and this place had great reviews. It's very clean and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful (which can't be said about most pho restaurants). The pho broth was very good on top of that. We will come back again when we're on this side of town."}
{"text":"So I've been slacking on my yelping of late, but if I'm going to write just ONE review, I have to tell you about this amazing place.  I Love (yes with a capital L) Pho Lan.  Each time we've been we started with an order of the banh knot.  These tiny little savory pancake like goodies are amazing. I've never had anything like them anywhere else, but they are truly delicious.  

Pho is one of my favorite dishes and I've ordered it every time I've been in.  Each time it is amazing.  The broth is perfectly prepared, and the meats and veggies are fresh and delicious.  You really can't go wrong with any of their pho offerings.  My wife has ordered one of their noodle dishes (the bon tom thit nuong - featuring pork and shrimp  with veggies) and it was delicious.  Service has been impeccable on every visit. From the minute we arrive until we leave the staff has been friendly and welcoming, with orders promptly taken, drinks promptly delivered, and food brought out in a timely fashion).  This is a great little place.  If you like Vietnamese food, you should check them out!"}
{"text":"After reading the yelp reviews I decided to check this place out. I stopped in for a late lunch.  There was only one other person eating at the time. The service was prompt & friendly. I started with the spring rolls. They were quite tasty. I wasn't overly impressed with their peanut sauce. I like it to be a bit sweeter, but that's a personal preference. I had the Pho for my entree. The cilantro, bean sprout, lime wedge accompaniment was a bit on the small side.  The Pho itself was hearty. They give you tons of vermicelli noodles. The yelpers were right about this place. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant and friendly staff. 

Ordered shaken beef, spring rolls and pho dac biet.  

Overall the food is good.  The pho broth could be hotter and a little more robust but the flank, tendon, tripe where all good. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM....One of the cleanest Vietnamese cuisine restaurant in Vegas. Staff has excellent quality service. 
  Now the food, I only had the pho tai. All three times I've been there. That being said, IT IS GOOOOD!! So \"Gosh Darn\" GOOD! Prob try another dish on my next visit but the pho tai is soooo GOOD! 
 Only sad thing about this restaurant is lack of customers when I've been there.( twice for lunch 1230pm and late or early dinner 5pm) maybe it's still a new place opened in July or maybe it's tucked in a strip mall u can't see from Decatur or desert inn. 
  I've tried most of the higher rated pho places but this is the first one I yelped. Well worth it. I hope this place doesn't fold due to lack or customers. Hopefully the other yelpers will spread the word about Pho Lan.
  \"Winter is Coming...(Game of Thrones) Pho is the best comfort food for the long winter. Pho Lan has it!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for family style pho this is the place the Thai tea is so delicious. It is my second time eating in this restaurant and I can say i will be a regular.. the fried pork egg roll is so tasty and juicy the fish sauce is delicious home made can't find that anywhere. This jewel is found on desert inn and Decatur on the north side. Thank you chef and the waiter for the excellent hospitality."}
{"text":"Pho was not the business here. I have tasted authentic pho and this was not it. The broth had no taste. It was not rich in flavor. I played around with my food and pushed it around in its bowl. It was just not good. I am from SF where food has its diversity and maybe I am spoiled a bit. 

I do have to compliment their nam nuong bi cuon though. That was good. Although I think the wrong sauce was given. It was like a sweet chili sauce that you normally get when you order lumpias. 

We came here on CNY only because the line for Pho Kim Long was out the door. My fiance had something gray/black floating in his water and I asked the guy to switch it out for him. He said \"Oh that's because we put lychee in the water.\" and walked away. Hmm okay then. I just gave my water to my fiance because the server did not come back to switch it out."}
{"text":"this place is in Chinatown itself and off in a little strip mall facing away from the road, after you get here you'll appreciate the food thats for damn sure. 

the owner is a Marine who communtes from San D during the week to run the family business. I dont think i've ever been to a place where every employee takes so much pride in the food. We were checked on many times and brought out little tid bits while waiting. Also ask for the vietnamese coffee, the owners grandad grows it on his farm; also the waiters will come over and make it for you table side. i was up for about 6 hours after a small cup. you can have it cold or hot; hot was great.

the Pho was legit, i got a big ass pig knuckle in there which added a leven of swiney goodness that i've yet to encounter in my broths in the northeash. the spring rolls were also in the upper class of rolls in my opinion. give the calamari a shot as well, its only available if its fresh from the market. (i wanted salt and pepper crab but it was out as well. 

def check this place out if you want a nice meal and a great price as well."}
{"text":"Love their thai tea! Freshly made by hand along with all the sauce.  The nem nuong is the best appetizers!"}
{"text":"We came here because of the amazing reviews and the pho definitely lives up to all the rave! The place is very clean, the staff is very friendly, and the food comes super quick...we were recommended to get the lemon pepper shrimp by the owner and it was so delicious. The pho broth is really good and the portions do not disappoint, we will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"Nice place but no one was around.  I am not a red meat eater and thought the menu was somewhat limited in the chicken and seafood department.  The pho was fragrant and tasty.  Thee is one pho price on the menu and that is for the large bowl.  if you have a smaller appetite like I do, a small bowl (a dollar less) is perfect.  Strips of breast of chicken, rice noodles and bean sprouts.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Staff was nice and attentive.  With all the other Pho joints in the area, we will continue to explore."}
{"text":"Great pho (I had the seafood), perfect broth, fresh vegetables, they have TV's for football, and most importantly, the owner could not by any nicer! We were on a long road trip and he sent us off with amazing Vietnamese coffee (it's like liquid crack) and free bottles of water. Next time I'm in LV I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I really like this place! Probably one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in town if not my favorite already. I read all the awesome reviews which lead me here. The restaurant is located in the Smith's shopping center on the corner of Decatur and Desert Inn. However a little tricky to find because it's facing the Decatur side. The chicken wings seemed to be the thing to order from the appetizers so I actually ordered that as my entree. My cousin ordered the pork chop rice platter. Our order came and we were both very pleased. As mentioned in another review by a Vietnamese herself, the wings were just like how her mom makes them. Beautiful crispness on the chicken wings and the flavor just right. I asked for no spice, however the next time I order it I'll ask for a little spice. The pork chop was good which was pretty standard because most Vietnamese places serve up a good pork chop. Is it just me or does anyone else love the fact that the Vietnamese serve sliced cucumbers and carrots on side? I really do love the fact that they do that because it certainly adds freshness to the dish. The prices here are reasonable. The service was kind of whatever, but I good enough I guess. The interior can best described as clean cut slightly modern with a mom and pop shop vibe. I think the food here can truly be comparable to that of what would eat at a typical Vietnamese family's house. I'm sure the pho is just as good so I will be ordering that the next time I'm here."}
{"text":"I saw lots of good review on yelp , so try Pho dac biet , the broth has no taste , meat and pho is sooooo much less . Can't even feel u up . When to \"Lee sandwich\" get me a sandwich after ."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and even better food. Can't wait to come back! The place is very clean and welcoming too."}
{"text":"It's rare that I ever come home from after eating somewhere and immediately write a review but their bun cha hanoi is legit!  The meat had a nice smokey char to it and the nuoc mam it was bathed in was perfect.

This review is based solely on that, the one Northern style dish that no one seems to get right out here in Vegas, they got it spot on.  The main part of this dish is the pork patty, other places I've had it was bland or the flavors were just not there and there was no charcoal taste to it.  This was so good, my daughter even said it was just like grandma's and that says a lot since my mom makes some of the best patties around!

We tried their beef pho too (rare steak and meatball), it was good but asking someone from Hanoi about beef pho is like asking a Northern yankee about southern fried chicken...I grew up eating pho ga (chicken pho) and hu tieu (another dish no one makes as good as my mom!). So far the only place that I've had the BEST pho ga is Turtle Tower in SF and my hunt for hu tieu as good as my mother's is still going....at least I know where I can go now whenever I want my bun cha Hanoi fix.  I just hope they stay open longer than the last owners.

This place used to house the old Pho Ha Noi, the new owners just took over this July so when I saw the \"new business\" on Yelp and saw that they had this, I rushed here not knowing it was the old pho place that I'd already been too.  When we pulled up, I sat in the car contemplating about whether I was going to go inside since I tried the bun cha hanoi from the previous owners and was underwhelmed.  I'm glad I gave it a chance!

The service was awesome also! Most Asian places, the service sucks royally but not here.  I watched as our server sat with a customer and described all the different dishes and asked the customer what he liked to help guide him in the right direction.

The location is off Decatur and Desert Inn so not as busy as Chinatown, but in the same area as Inaba (another great restaurant).  I really hope their business is successful cause so far they have the best Bun Cha Hanoi dish in all of Vegas.

We will definitely be back!  My only request next time, more than just one patty please!!"}
{"text":"Look out there's a new player in town for authentic Vietnamese food. The parking was effortless since it was a weekday and before the noon hour.

I wasn't in the mood for Pho so I went for the Bun bo hue which was garnished with fresh cabbage, sliced jalapeno peppers and mints. Once my bowl arrive, I  mixed everything and tasted the broth which was delish and not greasy. The BBH contained a nice variety of protein that really hit the spot on a cold day. Service was exceptional and my waiter even brought out an extension cord so I could charge my air card and laptop while I was dining! 

I'm looking forward to returning here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"The bun bo hue is good af.  I know bc I'm viet.  Their menu is extensive so you get a full range of tastes that fit any palate.  Vegan friendly bc my nerd sister is a vegan. She ordered the springs rolls with no meat. Lol. I'll be back fo sho."}
{"text":"Like most of the Yelpers here, this place was clean, service was friendly, and food was good. In fact, service was a lot friendlier and more attentive than expect for an Asian restaurant. I don't care either way but for those you do care then this is definitely the place for you bc not many true Asian restaurants are like this. We got the pho tai nam bo vien. We all thought the soup was really good and clean tasting and portions were appropriate. As part of being clean, their bean sprouts and mint leaves provided were the freshest I've seen (no browning in any of them).  We'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Vietnamese in town - so good we visited twice in a week!  

Extremely clean, nice ambience and the smell of fish sauce did not permeate the restaurant like many others. The waiters are attentive and the food comes out fairly quickly.

The food - simply excellent. The cha gio or egg rolls are perfectly fried. We had the pho tai and the pho with pork, shrimp and wontons (they even threw in some crab meat!). The pho broth tastes light and clean and is a great base for adding all the spices and seasonings. Best com bo luc lac or shaken beef we have ever had. They use tender juicy meat and it's prepared in a way where it's not swimming in oil or butter. Our kids loved it so much they were fighting for the last pieces. 

Looking forward to trying the other dishes..."}
{"text":"Don't understand the 4-1/2 star rating. I had the chicken pho. The broth had no flavor. The chicken did not taste fresh and was extremely dry. Tried husband's pho with rare steak, meat was also chewy and dry, though broth was better than mine. Service was fine. This one we can definitely cross off the list."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!! Honestly the best pho I have ever had and I have eaten a lot of pho. The people who work here are incredibly friendly and you can tell that the food is made with love. Definitely recommend eating here. The food is of a much higher quality than one can normally find."}
{"text":"I order the Bun Thit Nuong and Eggs roll that is okie but the eggs should give a litter more . They only give u 1 eggs roll . 
I went to Pho so 1 that is better compare to Here ."}
{"text":"I am only giving it 4 stars because I have only had 1 thing from the menu. The pho tai.  It is always very good! The place looks very clean and the staff is friendly. I hope the place sticks around because it is kinda hidden.  Check it out...it's good."}
{"text":"If you're looking for dishes you normally cannot find at other vietnamese restaurants, I would recommend coming here. Unique but good dishes like Beef Salad with Green Mango, Banh Khot, Bun Cha Hanoi and Com Tom Cang. The Com Bo Lu Lac is also very good. Other places make bo lu lac but many leave out the butter. This place uses quality meat and add butter to finish the wok charred beef - tastes the way it should!

Haven't tried the beef pho but the chicken pho (pho ga) was a little light in terms of taste in my opinion. But good thing, no MSG is used, if you're concerned with that. Another plus, the water doesn't smell or taste like bad tap water."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good Vietnamese in town. Found this place with great yelp review, so I gave it a try. 

Clean place. Friendly staff. I ordered egg rolls and special pho. Egg rolls were pretty good. Here comes the main dish - pho. Big disappointment! Broth is simply plain. That's the soul of the soup, it's soulless. :("}
{"text":"Just wanted something close by to our hotel and found this small family owned Vietnamese Restaurant, it's small but it's kept clean and tidy, since we just wanted something quick we both ordered the House Special Pho.
First we had the Salad Rolls and they were good! Fresh and filled with crisps lettuce, shrimp and pork, our soups came piping hot and first sip of the broth reassured me that it's going to be an enjoyable lunch! 
Again the most surprising thing here is: this is a residential neighbourhood and to have this small Pho place is a nice addition to the food selection for locals and visitors alike!"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. Highly recommended this spot if you're craving Vietnamese."}
{"text":"I've always trusted yelp. Every time when I feel like trying a new place, I always find myself checking yelp first. And it has never let me down.  Came here because of the good reviews from yelp... Sad to say, this is the first time I had a different conclusion than the rest of the yelpers!

The food was mediocre. Portions are considerably smaller than the average Vietnamese place, and the quality was not anything to write home about. I ordered the bun bo hue, and this was the first time the soup wasn't spicy... And the point was it was supposed to be spicy. Other dishes ordered (pho and stir fried noodles) were also on the smaller side and the taste bland. Very disappointed, especially after reading such good reviews!

The only good thing was that the service was very good. Perhaps it was because we were the only patrons in the restaurant, but the servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"Ate here about 7:20 pm Sat/12 Jul with my NY visiting buddy and his family (spouse and kids):
- We tried this place since it's so close to my home.
- Everyone enjoyed their food, which included marinated beef, pho, vermicelli, eggrolls appetizers.
- Prices are reasonable.
- Nice ambiance, great service."}
{"text":"The pho was average at best. The amount of noodles was ok but the amount of meat was minimal. The noodles were not the highest quality. The pho was served with a few beansprouts but no basil, lime, etc...
 The prices were on the high side considering the portions and quality. The eggrolls were plain nothing special. Ive had great pho/vietnamese food and this place was not that. 
The only thing that was great was the coffee, we were told it was fresh from the owners farm in vietnam. I wish them the best of luck but they need to improve to survive."}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price is what keeps me coming back for more. Their menu has something for everyone and, despite me having some favourites, I always look forward to trying something new."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new place for pho because I saw the good reviews on here but I was disapoointed. The pho was too overbearing for me. I usually eat all my pho no matter how big the bowl is, but this pho had no appealing taste. The egg rolls were bland. The com bo luc lac my brother had was okay, but I definitely prefer pho so 1. The nuoc cam was very bitter, tasted like they used spoiled oranges. However, I gave the second star because the staff was very nice. I will not return, sorry."}
{"text":"This place is legit.  The food, the staff, the restaurant itself (super clean) = SUPERB

I come from a family of Vietnamese restaurant owners and grew up serving bowls of pho, bun thit nuong, and cafe sua da to the masses so I'm a bit critical when trying new Vietnamese restaurants. Often times the best places are the ghetto ass hole-in-the-wall mom and pop shops that serve up the best grub.  Pho Lan, although not a ghetto ass hole-in-the-wall, is a very tasty mom and pop shop that serves up some really clean (note: NO MSG -- I know this b/c I wasn't bloated as hell after I left) authentic Vietnamese cuisine. 

I visited Pho Lan twice in the span of 4 days. I was sober the first time (Thursday during lunch) and hungover the second time (Saturday with 8 of my gfs during lunch -- come on, it's Vegas). Both dining experiences were great. 

Upon entering, the place was a little empty (probably b/c it's new and just opened). It's very clean and organized for a Vietnamese restaurant. If you've ever been to a Vietnamese restaurant, it's typically a freakin circus.  Anyway, I figured, \"ohh... it's going to be one of those places that's pretty, but the food will be blah\" but decided to give it a go.

I had the fried egg rolls and chicken wings to start.  The egg rolls were fried to perfection and the chicken wings were to die for (just the way my mom makes them). I also had the Pho Ga which was super clean and flavorful. The second time I came, I had the Pho Dac Biet and tried my friend's Bo Luc Lac (shaky beef).  Both items totally hit the spot.

Another thing to note, the wait staff were super friendly and accommodating.  They charged my iPhone for me while I ate (what some restaurants in NYC charge $30 for -- damn you Standard Hotel East Village!!).  Also, the bathroom is freakin immaculate (I need to get the name of their cleaning lady). 

If you're in Vegas for work or leisure, drop by Pho Lan. You're in for quite a treat."}
{"text":"What a find!  Thanks to everyone that yelped about this place before me.  

Let first start off by saying this place is very clean.  The service is amazing.  It is a family run restaurant with a mother son team cooking.  The food is delicious.  I had the a big bowl of pho with everything in it.  The soup was flavorful and light, not all seasoned up and salty like at other places.  The spring rolls were tasty and fresh with the right mixture of meat to veggie to noodle ratio. 

I will be back to try the bon bo hue in memory of my dad who loves that stuff. 

Most definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pho Lan was an amazing place for our lunch today! Pho-great flavors, fresh, beautiful! Service-friendly and helpful! Facility-SPOTLESS!

Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out because it was rated highly and as usual Yelp didn't disappoint. It's clean and well decorated inside as others have said. Our waiter was very friendly. I asked for the Bun Bo Hue, the waiter looked at me like I had three heads and asked if I was sure about three or four times. (I'm about as white as they come). Yes I know it has pork blood.  It was excellent although the spicyness caught me off guard and nearly killed me a couple of times. They don't seem to use as much in the way of meat and noodles as some other places I've been to but the broth was very flavorful. We'll be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Came looking for pho, found so much more. Great appetizers from the tradition fresh spring rolls with shrimp & port, to beef mango salad that was awesome to a new fish I hadn't had before.. Shrimp pancake with a touch of scallion & coconut (for $4.95 it's a must!).  Fresh ingredients, a no grill atmosphere and very friendly staff; we will be back.  Oh yeah, and table brewed Vietnamese coffee with sweet condensed milk. Yum!"}
{"text":"The service is friendly and attentive. The food not bad. I grew up in a family that is a mix of Vietnamese and Chinese. I know that my palate could be a little skewed because my parents tend to mix some of the flavors of both. 

I like their Gi Cun Nem Nng. The crispy tofu skins in it gives it another texture that puts just lettuce to shame. I am a huge fan of Bún bò Hu. I can't say that I will order it just anywhere. I like it because it has so many different components that makes for a rich and complex soup. Pho Lan's chili oil on the side really made the dish for me. I like a little more kick to my broth. The adding of all the fresh herbs and lime helped as well. I did like that they have the pig knuckles and blood cake in it. 

The menu is simple and I would want to try other items."}
{"text":"Soup is really good! Noodle isn't fouled, and not soft too much. Herbs are fresh. 
I had also spring rolls too, it tastes good as well."}
{"text":"Clear broth without preservatives and MSG. Very tasty and waiter remembers regular customers and orders. Friendly and eager to please."}
{"text":"Food was tasty (definitely authentic), and the service was fine. 

However, the prices were pretty high considering each dish that came out looked like it was a half portion (and in some cases it seemed like 1/3 portion). Spent about $50 for 2 and I walked out still hungry... And I'm just an average eater at best. 
My guess is that the high price with minimal portions would be the direct reason why this restaurant is so empty most of the time."}
{"text":"Pho Lan is good, although they charge for some of the \"extras\" that usually come included (such as a spring roll cut up on Bún).  Their Wor won ton soup is one of the better versions of the dish I've had, although the lack of a bigger size means I'm usually buying something else, too (i.e., spending more than $15 just on myself).

This is one of two or three vietnamese restaurants in Chestermere, and is certainly worth trying.  I've chatted with the owner a few times, and she's a very nice lady who really respects her customers.

It's easy to miss this place; it's attached to a gas station in a gravel parking lot.  The pin on the map is a bit misleading; access Pho Lan from Merganser Drive W (not from Hwy 1A / Chestermere Blvd)."}
{"text":"Fantastic pho, a real surprise. Coming from los angeles and having all the good viet food in oc this pho is actually better than most.  Broth is fantastic and clean."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. Brought my friend who loves Pho, and proclaims herself an expert taster. 
Place was actually fairly empty at 5:30pm on a cold Monday night. Maybe 3 tables out of 20 or more. Ordered the pork fried rolls, and Pho Tai Nam, substituting well done brisket for rare flank. 

The Pho broth is delicious, hardly any salt flavoring which brought out all the other flavors which have been disguised by too much salt at other Pho places. Big positives for this. Only negative would be not enough meat, they do use quality meats and its only $6.75 for a small bowl (which did fill us up). 

My Pho expert friend gave them a big thumbs up as well for the flavor of the soup. 

The restaurant is big, very clean, and tucked away behind the Smiths on Desert Inn and Decatur. The owner was very nice, and chatted with us for awhile.
Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Was graving some great Vietnamese food while on our trip to Las Vegas and since we are originally from Orange County where there are plenty of great Vietnamese restaurants, we were expecting the best. Thank you Yelp for leading us to this great restaurant. The place was very clean and staff was very friendly and attentive. There was plenty to choose from. Of course the kids wanted their fried rice and egg rolls which came out crunchy and flavorful. I loved their grilled pork chops with rice and veggies. The hubby ordered the #7 beef noodle pho which had a very tasty broth. We ordered some chicken wings for the road as well. We will surely visit again when we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very clean and the staff are very nice.  I had the fried noodles with shrimp, chicken and beef.  The flavor of each individual ingredient was well blended together to create a very enjoyable meal.  The other person with me enjoyed his meal as well and the prices are very reasonable.  You would spend more at Denny's for a processed meal."}
{"text":"While I am not Vietnamese, I love pho and consider myself a pho connoisseur. It's both comfort food and a staple. 

This was my first visit to Pho Lan after being badly disappointed at the other place I frequent in Las Vegas. We visit only once a year during CES, and so did not realize that Pho Saigon 8 had gone down the tubes. Checking out the Yelp reviews, we settled on Pho Lan, and the reviews were reliable as usual.

The place was large and clean. Service was excellent - friendly without being too obtrusive. The Pho broth was delicious - it is the lighter style but delicious and not salty at all. However, it could have been a bit hotter as it was not hot enough to cook the bean sprouts I had stuck in there. I ordered #7 which was the more expensive combination, but there seemed to be just a couple of strips of tripe and tendon. Far too little - even though these are the cheap bits (which I love best). There was barely enough meat to go with all the noodles. 

Will be back next year...... and hopefully give them another star."}
{"text":"I don't know if the previous yelpers ate at the same restaurant as I did but this was quite possibly the worst food I've had in years. Bun bo hue had zero flavor, the pork sausage in my sister's bowl tasted like it was spoiled and the beef in my bowl tasted bland. The pho wasn't any better either. All noodles and broth and very little beef. I can cook better food than what's being served from the place. And I'm not even a good cook."}
{"text":"I'm looking for authentic Vietnamese food and I found Pho Lan on yelp so just give it a try. Surprise that they have such a good tasty appetizer and delicious pho soup which is I can't stop sipping the broth. The service is great and the restaurant is clean. Check in at 1pm on Saturday but kind a quite for lunch time, only 3 table including mine. I like it peace and quite time for my lunch anyway I will be back again before leaving Vegas, don't forget to try Vietnamese coffee that come straight from Vietnam ."}
{"text":"Located in an obscure strip mall location, it's a bit hard to find. 

We arrived around 7 on a Friday evening and the place was pretty empty. The restaurant is spacious and clean-looking. 

We ordered some eggrolls to start and then took our time choosing entrees. I ordered the grilled pork and eggroll vermicelli bowl and it was really good. All the veggies were fresh and I enjoyed my meal. They offered us complimentary Vietnamese coffees and we couldn't resist. I was buzzing after a few sips, but it was delicious. 

Service was excellent. Friendly and superior to many other restaurants I frequent in town. 

I would be curious to try their pho and a different appetizer the next time I visit. I hope they have more patrons then."}
{"text":"This is an excellent family owned restaurant.  Everything is very clean and the owners are some of the nicest people ever.  We ordered pho and egg rolls; both were very good and as other reviewers mentioned it doesn't give you that tired, overwhelmed feeling that pho sometimes can.  

My daughter wanted a plain lemonade which wasn't on the menu, but we asked if they had some anyway and they said yes. What we didn't know was that our waiter had to run to the store to get the lemons.  We felt so bad for the trouble and we were also surprised by their commitment to offering superior customer service.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, quick friendly service. Worst tasting pho soup I've ever had and I keep going back because I feel sorry for the old lady that runs the place but I can't seem to find my way back. It's just not satisfying even the \"bun\" beef or chicken it's crap to. Spring rolls are good but anything deep
Fried is"}
