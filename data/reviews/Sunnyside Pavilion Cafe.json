{"text":"This is one of those places that is hard to qualify.  On one hand the food is mediocre at best.  on the other the location is spectacular.  I would give the food two stars and the rest five stars.  The food is not bad exactly, just uninspired, competent and boringly mediocre.  I have been here multiple times over the years and so far this is a consistent feature across all the dishes I have sampled, which is most of them.  But obviously I keep going back...  The location is situated right on the beach, and is just far enough out of the way to be mostly dominated by locals.  There are few spots that can compare on a warm summer night when the sun is setting. Its home, the historic Sunnyside Beach House, one of the last remnants of the amusement park that was demolished for the Gardiner Expressway, was recently renovated, polishing the gem it already was."}
{"text":"The spot is beautiful, the food is ok to medicore, but the servers are young and clearly not well trained.  We were there on a warm sunny afternoon when a guy came along closing all the shade umbrellas without a word.   We would not have sat down if there hadn't been shade.  When we asked we were told there was too much wind, though we hadn't noticed any.  We weren't allowed even to keep it open until they brought the bill.  Will think twice before returning."}
{"text":"I would give this place probably a 3.5 if that was possible. Great atmosphere right on the beach and by high park. Sunnyside Cafe is very pretty, especially during sunset if you are sitting at the lovely patio. I highly recommend the brochette with feta, which was delightful as was the service. My friend and I both had the strawberry pecan salad and the boccacini salad respectively.   I could barely finish the generous portions, but it was a perfect for a nice summer dinner. The only downside was the surprisingly small and dull selection of beer and wine."}
{"text":"Great location for a summer day. Food is extremely meh. Margaritas are meh too. Great place for a beer and scenery."}
{"text":"I can see that this place gets lousy reviews for service,  but our server this afternoon was a total sweetheart.  She was friendly, helpful,and quick and made us feel so comfortable and at home on the patio that we ended up staying longer and ordering more than we planned. It certainly helps that the patio is gorgeous. I had a couple of reasonably priced.($8) piñata coladas that were very tasty and very boozy, as well as the quesadilla. The quesadilla itself was a little bland, it could have used some jalapeño but I really liked that it came with guacamole that didn't cost extra.  When combined with the nice spicy salsa, sour cream and guac, it was pretty good. My fiancé had a mushroom burger that he really enjoyed.  The food was not the greatest ever but it was reasonably priced and the patio is one of the best in Toronto, combined with the great service we got today, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Sunnyside Cafe today for lunch with a friend of mine. The cafe is located by the beach and offers selections like gourmet sandwiches, gourmet pizza and entries ranging from different types of pasta to steak.  The cafe is well worth the visit just to enjoy the view from the patio. The pictures here don't give it justice.  I ordered an Angus burger. It came with a side of fries. The burger contained the standard lettuce, tomato and pickle for the toppings. It was delicious.  While your there be sure to check out the garden and water fountain located in the back where the washrooms are.  Positives: - patio seating - beautiful view of the beach - good romantic date type location - clean and well maintained washrooms - wine list - accepts interact  Negatives - none  Neutral - The food may seem expensive to some"}
{"text":"Great location - right on the water. You can watch the beach volleyball players in the summer while you sip a daquiri or a beer. Used to come here all the time when I lived in High Park, as I would often pass this location on my runs. Food is also pretty good - although prices are a little expensive for what you get. Service is generally alright, however it does get very busy in the summer so don't expect extremely quick service. Perfect if you want a relaxing drink by the water and aren't in a rush."}
{"text":"A favourite spot of mine, this Cafe offers a perfect vantage point to enjoy the great scenery offered by the beach while enjoying a pint and some great pub food!! A unique spot for Toronto and since it is pretty large you can usually get a table without a wait....this place gets top marks!!!"}
{"text":"Rude and inept from beginning to end. We went there last summer and, although the place was half empty, they made us wait for a table because 'we just sat a bunch of people all at once... we need to stagger... ' or some BS like that. Then when we were finally seated, the service was SLLLOOOWWWW, and they got the order half wrong! On top of that, what we were served was pretty average. The location is nice, but with so many amazing restaurants in the city, I wouldn't bother ever coming back here."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful location on a sunny day! The food quality is considerably better than it used to be, but why can't they figure out this customer service thing? How hard can it be?  First, no kids menu. So my family can't go here regularly with my kids because I'm forced to buy a $15 adult meal which my kids won't even eat half of.  Second, the full menu is available all day but the lunch menu has only 4 options available until 5pm. What's the point? The lunch options are relatively the same price and size as dinner options. Why stop serving them at 5?  And why not offer 1/2 size options of the larger entrees at lunch? So I am discouraged from going here for lunch.  And no side salads. Order a full salad or none (see below).     Last, general service issues. Every time I go there is something:  This time we had a group of 7 that needed two tables to be put together. But we could only have one umbrella, despite the fact that the place was half full and there were plenty of umbrellas available that could have been moved over for us. We asked a second time and the waitress returned from the back saying the manager instructed her to not help us out, it's \"the policy\".  Who makes such a stupid policy?   Is this written down in the back somewhere?  Her only solution was to move inside or we could split our party up into two tables and sit separately.  So we all had to huddle under one umbrella or choose to cook in full sun.  Then my friend and I ordered a pizza and salad but wanted to share them - it was lunch time and the pizzas are huge (and remember, no side salads). Instead of plating them as such in the kitchen, they brought them out whole. I had to ask for extra plates and had to re-plate everything at the table myself.  On top of the disregard for service and our convenience, this speaks to the lack of a lunch menu options. Why not offer a 1/2 pizza/salad lunch combo?!?!?  Besides all that the food and drinks are all good and priced fairly for this beautiful venue.  I live close and would be here all the time if it weren't for the poorly thought out menu and poor customer service policies."}
{"text":"This amazing patio is only open seasonally and the perfect summer destination. It's located right along the beach so wherever you sit you have a clear  view of the beach and water. It's also located right along the Sunnyside boardwalk so there are an endless stream of runners, walkers, and bikers passing by.   The food is really tasty, I'm a big fan of their salads.   They also do events (weddings) in the upstairs space."}
{"text":"This is such a great place to relax and enjoy the lake view. It's so casual, yet romantic. This is where my husband and I met for the first time! The food here is good, prices are ok. It's closed this month unfortunately (April 2017)."}
{"text":"We  bike ride for breakfast worth the ride. Great service friendly and fast. The food was awesome the veiw is spectacular. You feel like your on vacation. My husband and I have  been coming for over a year always satisfied."}
{"text":"I went to sunny side pavilion today for lunch. The atmosphere is unlike any other place I've been in the city: Outdoor seating right on the beach across from bikini clad volleyball players and the glittering blue water with a live spanish guitar player softly crooning near the entrance. I felt like I was on vacation.   The service was prompt and friendly. We had:  Chicken quesadillas - 5/5 these were excellent and a great sharing size (4 good sized pieces)   Chicken club wrap - 4/5 a bit heavy on the lettuce but very tasty. The greek salad it came with was nice.   Mango smoothie - 4/5 one of the better smoothies I've had at a place that doesn't exclusively serve smoothies. It wasn't loaded with syrup.   I can't give this 5 stars because I only had 2 things on the menu, but both were delicious and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is horrible.  Got all excited about a wood oven  pizza,  it was burnt but soggy,  how does that even happen?   I've had better frozen wings at home,  fries were stale,  and calamari was the worst I ever had.   Thank got they have a view. Come for drinks,  don't eat here!"}
{"text":"Ceaser was good but the food was terrible. Pizza wings and calamari all tasted like frozen food. We also had to wait while there were empty tables."}
{"text":"Went to this shit hole without checking reviews bad idea. Ordered the southwestern burger. Bun came with hairy mold on the bottom. Manager is an asshole"}
{"text":"the prices are not at the low end but then you're paying for the great view. and location.  and the patio is huge - they can accommodate everyone almost any day.   there is some slight discount on the pizzas and I think sandwiches for paddlers but not on anything else.  they have cool frozen drinks variety. with ice cream and alcohol=) yay=) life can't get better when you're sitting on a patio next to the lake sipping sweet chill drink with a couple of friends."}
{"text":"Ordered the veggie 'wood-fired oven' pizza and it was pretty good! Lots of goat cheese, and the crust was consistent thickness throughout. Location is also great - right along the beach.  Service went from good to horrible though, over the course of our meal."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems in the heart of Toronto that is worth visiting if you're in the area.  Right along the boardwalk on the west end of the city, is a patio that overlooks the beach and Lake.  Most times in the summer you can watch some beach volleyball.   It's a great ambiance and a very nice date setting.  Since renovating they have some nice high top tables and lounge seating.  It makes you feel like you're on vacation for a second.   Grab a drink and just bask in the sun, or have lunch or dinner.  I love their pizzas.  It's thin crusted but still has a bit of a crunch that makes the dough crispy.  We had the mushroom pizza with kale Parmesan and balsamic.  It was great.  We also had the lobster tacos as an appetizer.  It was really good bursting with fresh lobster meat.  Drinks and two dishes was about $27 per person."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday for lunch and we were surprised to see that there were plenty of tables available on such a sunny day.  The atmosphere is lovely but unfortunately the food is just okay.  The menu is pretty basic - burger, pizza, sandwiches etc.  nothing too exciting.  I had a chicken wrap with fries - the fries were good but I found the sandwich to be a bit soggy.  The service was friendly and fast. The desserts looked good - might try coming again and just ordering desserts. I would give a 4/5 for the service and atmosphere but the food brings it down to a 3/5"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Sunnyside - the bathing pavilion was built in 1932 and is one of my fav buildings in the city.    Yesterday I kicked back with some friends on the patio, had some interesting new beers (Keiths white for one), stellar service and some decent apps.  On a muggy Toronto day, sitting down having beers at Sunnyside definitely hit the spot.  There's also now a swimming area just off the beach/patio, cordoned off and filtered for freshness I'm told."}
{"text":"This place is like visiting the \"before\" in a kitchen nightmares episode.   It's sad that there are few places in Toronto to enjoy our waterfront. It's a tragedy that one of the few waterfront places has such awful service and disgusting food.   For $22 you'd think you'd get at least a decent pizza instead of something so obviously reheated.   This place has the location and architecture to be a real gem and a destination spot, but instead they're happy to be moderately busy with no repeat customers."}
{"text":"Beautiful location, awful service. The server we had was constantly swearing in front of customers, which consisted of elderly people and children, throughout the entire breakfast. My friend and I tried to tell her politely that people could hear her and she flew off the handle yelling at us and saying \"BYEEEE\" as we walked away. There was a blatant disregard for anyone around her and she made everybody extremely uncomfortable. We left half way through our breakfast because we were so disgusted with her attitude. A man and his young son came in as she was yelling at us and he said he would rather go to Pizza Pizza. Save your 20$ and go to McDonalds for a breakfast sandwich and a smile."}
{"text":"This place is coasting on location. And, indeed, it is a lovely spot to sit and enjoy drinks at, if you can negotiate a table. I've been there three times in the last few weeks and all three times found it an enormous challenge to get seated at one of the many empty waterside tables.  When the draw to a restaurant is waterside location, there is no excuse for empty waterside tables when there is a line of people waiting to get in.   On my visits, my companions and I approached the boardwalk \"gate\" (a really classy rope prevents people from entering the restaurant) and asked to be seated at one of the available tables. Each time I was told that the sections were \"too busy\" and that the server was overloaded and we would have to be seated at one of the tables at the back. On my most recent visit, after talking to several staff members and noting that we were in no hurry to be served, two argumentative staffers said, \"if you don't like it, leave\". We eventually accepted a back table from a more reasonable individual, then asked our server if we could move to the table we originally requested, which was no problem at all!  The food is overpriced and nothing memorable. No effort made.   Even though I live nearby and could give this place lots of my business, I will not be returning until the management changes their attitude. There are lots of condos and houses nearby and only so many tourists. Good luck to this business is what I say."}
{"text":"Amazing location, feels like you are at Miami beach!!! We have ordered pepperoni pizza, mediteranian flat bread, chicken wings and mushroom burger for 4 of us, each around $16, all were pretty delicious!!! All meals very pretty filling, especially pizza. Our waitress was very pleasant and our meals were served very quickly, very nice  experience."}
{"text":"We have been coming here as a group for a while now. At first, they allowed each individual to pay their part individually.  They keep adding more and more rules that make it very inconvenient to come here. First rule, no separate bills or paying by card separately. Second rule, no breaking change for customers. I am not sure why they thinking making it harder and harder to pay is good customer service.  The food and the service is okay but these obtuse requirements make it hard to enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem: great location for people watching and sunsets. Live in the area and have been coming for years.  Probably the worst food in the city. Frozen everything that's barely warmed up. Why are people raving about the pizza it's been frozen prior to be barely warmed up. Try to get them to customize the pizza!!! Wings frozen, calamari frozen. Soggy fish and chips. This place is great for a beer and atmosphere. Eat before coming down. Owners please change the menu and get some fresh food. I can't believe the rave reviews on food!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. It was on a weekend so it was quite packed but for great sits at the patio. As the name of the place says it is a cafe kinda style and not a fine restaurant. I enjoyed very much the pizza and I will recommend people to try the Mediterranean or BBQ chicken. Great pizzas and that's what is getting four stars :)"}
{"text":"Very reasonable price.  I would have expected over priced meals in this location, but they're not.  The food is also OK.  Nothing to amaze your friends with, but if you're on the lake and feeling peckish, is absolutely an acceptable place to stop by."}
{"text":"Went there Monday! Had a chance to watch volleyball and dragon boat racing practices. Had the seafood pizza and quesadillas and enjoyed both immensely. Servers were attentive! Will definitely come again given the opportunity!"}
{"text":"With that beautiful view of the lake, how can't you seat and ask for some drinks?   OMG IT'S A TRAP. RUN AWAY FAST.   Service is awful, they will not look at your face to take orders, drinks are INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. Only the food is cheap, but everybody has to drink something, specially when it's sunny outside. Do not even think about asking for beer, otherwise you may go bankrupt.   If you want to have some real lakeshore fun, go for the ice cream truck. Will save you some dollars and you won't have to scream for the ice cream. Ha."}
{"text":"Gord and I had lunch today on the patio at Sunnyside Pavilion Café.  We sat on the patio.    Gord ordered a basic pizza.  He said it was good and he'd get it again.  He took a couple slices home.  I ordered Chicken Fettuccini (without mushrooms).  It was really good (I ate it all) and I'd get it again.  Adam was our server.  He was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance. Unfortunately we found a rude waitress. We waited to be seated and she let in a couple who were behind us. We had to ask and she mentioned that they were waiting. We did not see them waiting though. There were a lot of tables available so I did not understand the wait...we asked her for a table with shade and she said that she was not sure. We could see atleast 5 tables.....I guess we were a bit too polite!......  We would have spent atleast 100 dollars. Too bad. Maybe business is too good for the management here. The Asian waitress was definitely the worst we have ever seen....  bad experience. Stay away!"}
{"text":"VIBE  This is one of my favourite beach side locations in the city (okay, well maybe there's about two to three in the city but I'm a romantic, what can I say?). I was here before the crowds settled in on a Sunday on a sunny day. It was great: without the clutter of people, we could just relax and enjoy the view of the sun glistening on the lake.   If the courtyard in the back got a fresh coat of white paint it would look brand new. Unfortunately, it looks deteriorated. That said, the architecture is fantastic and very photograph-worthy.   Staff: because we were near the entrance, the staff were on attendance and it felt like we were being watched. I hate the hover! That said, our waitress was fantastic - she was nice and friendly; she managed her tables well.   WE ATE  As stated in an article in The Standard, you could classify Sunnyside as a crappio-- great patio but crap food. That said, for what it was the food was decent and yes, it was way overpriced.   We had the fried shrimp which were great and not over battered;  the chicken quesadilla which came with guac (yay!) and a greek salad - which wasn't really a greek salad but a spring mix salad from a bag, red onions, feta (at least it wasn't Canadian feta) and kalamata olives. Though the portion was big, for $11, this was ridiculously overpriced. Most salads in Greektown are about $6 to $7.   They make a pretty mean pina colada here.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Sunny side up! I'd still come here just to get some sun. Sunnyside is one of those places that's a discovery and make you happy to escape your own neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place looks nice from the outside stay away from the food. go play volleyball or enjoy the pool, just not eat or drink here. The patio is relatively small. The service was not great, the waitress did not act like she wanted to be there or talk to us. Our group of 8 order about 95$ worth of pizza at the dragonboat discount rate. Even then, i don't believe their 12' pizza justified the price tag.  We got chicken, grilled veggie and Mediterranean pizza for some variety. The chicken supreme has the most toppings, while the veggie pizzas didn't have much fresh vegetables at all. I can also tell the cheese had an artificial taste to them.  honestly, dr.oetker's ristorante frozen pizza tasted better than the thin crust here. oh and the crusts were actually burned Black on half of the pizzas we ordered."}
{"text":"We have come here over the years especially when there is something happening in that area of the city in the summer.  The location is great as you can sit on the patio under an umbrella and watch the lake, volleyball players, people strolling on the boardwalk or even the airshow in September.  I also love the little courtyard as the building has a lovely Mediterranean feel.  Now for the food.  I personally have had some good meals here.  I had the wraps which were delicious with good portions and a side of nice fries.  My friends always seemed to enjoy their meals too.  I was surprised to see some reviews where people were disappointed.  I have never had the pizza so I cannot comment on that.  The drinks served were always cold and welcome on a hot day.  We received good service and on a busy day, we had to be patient for a short wait until a table became available on the patio.  Overall, a pleasant place to eat and relax for us."}
{"text":"When you have good view, maybe you don't have good food.   Came here on a beautiful Sunday after walk on the beach for hours. The view was gorgeous and the Staff were nice but the food sucks... no better word.  Nothing was worth to remember or even take a picture of it. Selection was small, food seems composed from pre-cooked package, and many things on the menu is running out since they are closing soon for the end of the season.  Can be improved."}
