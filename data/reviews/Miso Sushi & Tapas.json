{"text":"This restaurant has the best sushi! When I went i got the dynamite cream cheese roll and the Volcano roll. The volcano roll has so many flavours and is one of the best item on their menu. 
For the Tapas we got the BBQ Kalbi which was okay. For only 3 pieces, it's quite expensive and not worth it in my opinion. 

The owner is very friendly and the service is amazing here! The last two times that I've gone there the owner is always smiling and making sure everyone is happy with their order. Even though the restaurant is quite far from where I live, I would definitely go back! I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great couple who own it, they are so friendly and great with our kids.  If you are a fan of fun and inventive rolls, you'll love the volcano roll.  Tuna tataki, rock shrimp, and hot bowls are also delicious.  Definitely our favourite sushi place in Oakville."}
{"text":"The volcano roll and the tataki was delicious! The service was excellent. Coming back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Wow! My husband and I went for dinner this evening and honestly the best sushi we have had in a long time! The owner Fiona is dedicated to fresh fish and delicious offerings. Thank you Fiona for coming to Oakville beautiful space and Amazing food!! We are so happy we have a great place to go for our weekly night out!!"}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem while I was searching for good sushi places near Oakville. I'm originally from Toronto, so I had no idea / expectation of how the sushi would taste. I was very surprised by the quality and quantity of the two dishes we ordered: Tempura Udon and Miso Sushi combo.

The Tempura Udon was very filling and tasted very good compared to a lot of other sushi places in Toronto. Normally, since udon is not the place's speciality, the chefs do a half-okay job making it, but not here. It seemed like an actual \"dish,\" part of their specialities.

The Miso Sushi combo tasted fresh and delicious. The spicy salmon roll that came with it was stuffed and fresh; not to mention, for the price it tasted even better

I gave a last +1 star for the service. The waitresses &the manager were all very accommodating and made sure that we were satisfied with the dishes.

I will definitely visit this place again if I get a chance to be in Oakville."}
{"text":"Have been there twice. Decent foods and nice ppl. Definitely recommend for couple and small group."}
{"text":"Owners were nice and friendly.  Food is good but a bit pricey.  Good variety.  Not very kid friendly though, especially since I have two young children but there were no high chairs.  Portions could be bigger for the price but the food was very yummy."}
{"text":"Good but quite pricey sushi. Service was excellent and waitress was very attentive. The volcano roll easily 6 pieces for $17? But tasted delicious. Rock shrimp roll could have been better ( felt more like a California with a  glazed shrimp tempura on top )"}
{"text":"Amazing Sushi restaurant. I ate here with my husband and two kids. The owner was. Extremely attentive and made excellent suggestions for both appetizers and our mains as well. We had the tuna tartar appetizer, it was incredible, an excellent balance of flavour. The rolls were inventive and so flavourful. A must try on the lakeshore!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places I have ever bought sushi from! Although I have only had take-out, I have been so pleased by the customer service that I think about this restaurant every time I'm in Oakville! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Stopped in last night for dinner with the family after reading the reviews on Yelp.  The sushi was very fresh and my wife loved the green salad.  They make their own dressings.  The service was incredible.  Best sushi and service we have had in a long time.  Looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"I travel a great deal around the world and I  can tell you this is one of the best restaurants I have eaten in...Thomas and Fiona care deeply about what  they serve and how that is received.amazing food, amazing service and incredible hosts...wow....kudos to you folks....not sure this can be matched!  The food is multi layered in taste...one of the best I have eaten at...."}
{"text":"Very good place for Japanese food ! There are a lot of different options as you can get udon, sashimi, rolls, hot bowls, tapas kind of Japanese food too. I tried rolls which were really good as well as the bulgogi. The green tea cheesecake was really good too. And the staff was nice."}
{"text":"I've been to miso several times and it never disappoints. The food is fantastic - very fresh and creative. We had the shrimp on the rock which was delicious. Also ordered the spicy tuna caterpillar, the green dragon roll and sushi combo - they were so good we forgot to take picture of them! The owners (who are a couple) are always so friendly. Definitely highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Really good sushi and food in general! You get what you paid for and the quality is very high. Their mountain roll is really good as well as shrimp rock so definitely given them a try is you are in Oakville!"}
{"text":"Went after attending a show in Oakville.  Absolutely fabulous.!
The best sushi ever. Staff were amazing. Will go back as soon as we can."}
{"text":"Recently, June 2018, the chef changed.

I ate here 3 times with the new chef and all I can say is that they have a cook, not a chef. The menu is the same, the choices in the chef selection prepared okay at best and the order of the pieces is detrimental instead of being coherent, or logical. Eel to start and jalapeno on a delicate piece? You must be insane! The new chef is incompetent in my opinion.

The owner is great and the bar selection is decent. That's all I can say is good."}
{"text":"Found this place because we had originally planned on eating at Colossus next door, but they were packed because it was a Saturday night. 

Interior decor and overall atmosphere was really nice and our servers were friendly. The restaurant wasn't very full, maybe 4 other tables full inside.

I ordered the tempura udon ($19) portion sizes were large and it came quite a good amount of tempura. I really enjoyed it! We also ordered the Dynamite rolls  (9 for $14)

My boyfriend ordered the chicken teriyaki dinner ($22 I think), however we noticed that his dish came with a little bit of meat on top of a large stirfry that was not cooked very well. (Large ends of cabbage and onion were tossed in.) Presentation wasn't the greatest either, everything look kinda plopped on. Chicken was good but the stirfry was a miss. He did like the miso and salad though. 

Overall, I'd recommend it. 
-1 star for the undercooked stirfry. Prices are on the higher end of what I've seen on similar dishes so I'd say you aren't getting the best value, but that's what you have to expect for Oakville restaurants."}
{"text":"They took over from Izakaya and I was worried that it wouldn't be the same. The great news is it's better. They added a lot of Japanese staples for those who are not creative eaters but just try the volcano roll (spicy) and you will never leave. Only problem is that we still haven't taken our kids as we enjoy the spicy dishes so much but we will soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by in Oakville on way to Toronto.  Really enjoyed the venue and the food.  The owners/managers were very friendly.
We loved a lot of the \"fusion\" items on the menu."}
{"text":"This is one of the only sushi places in Oakville that opens late so I came here with a friend. Got there around 830 on a Monday night. It wasn't busy at all. It was just my friend and I and another couple.

The sashimi itself, can't really go wrong with it. My tako Yaki however, the octopus was still frozen! There was literally only 4 people total in the restaurant, there shouldn't be no reason for them to rush the food.

Lastly, my friend's beer had a fruit fly in it."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!! My husband & I LOVED every minute! From the minute we walked in, to the minute we left - we were treated like family! Food was delicious, drinks were tasty - even learned a bit about sake! I always thought I didn't like sake - but the owners really helped us! Sushi rolls were AWESOME!!! Tasty green tea ice cream! Staff was super nice, helpful  & attentive! DEFINITELY our new favorite place - CANT WAIT to go back!!!"}
{"text":"As someone who eats sushi almost on a daily basis I was looking forward to check out this highly rated local restaurant. While not inexpensive the quality and standard of the food should cause no one to complain about prices. While a readily available selection of Sake is the traditional beverage that can accompany Japanese food I was disappointed to find the wine list very limited perhaps to encourage having Sake.
Every dish we ordered was good but my 15 piece Sashimi was excellent.
The menu is extensive and would suit any aficionados of Japanese cuisine other than sushi or sashimi and I am compelled to return very soon on this culinary voyage of discovery."}
{"text":"I came here with my husband and 10 month-old baby during the Oakville Jazz Festival.

I'm on the fence about this place because in order for me to give five stars across the board, there needs to be an excellent combination of ambience, price, taste, selection and service. 

Ambience: super cool. Love the decor and the choice of seating ranges from booth, regular tables and tall tables. You're greeted in the formal Japanese way similar to Izakaya and the table is all set with plates and utensils.

For people who want to come here with kids, there are NO high chairs or booster. To me, this is unacceptable. There is no reason why a casual dining restaurant shouldn't have at least one high chair. Note to the manager, they are $20 (with a tray) at IKEA. Safer than parents having to hold their babies in one hand and hold chopsticks in the other, at least. 

Price: on the pricier side. We got the Sushi Mania (11 pieces of sushi) for $22. To me, this is expensive. I usually go to a sushi restaurant in Mississauga that is absolutely amazing and can get a 20 piece assorted sushi plate that comes with miso soup and green salad. ELEVEN pieces of sushi for $22 and no sides?! I was very disappointed. I ordered a salad on the side and it was $5 for a small. Eek. The dynamite roll, on the other hand, was fairly priced at $12. Our whole bill, with two beers, came to $70. Aiyayayaa~~ maybe Oakville people are bigger spenders than me but for 11 sushi and one hand roll?? I walked out of here unsatisfied.

Taste: I'm reading all these reviews and they are all raving about this place and I'll admit, the taste is great! But it's no better or different than the aforementioned sushi restaurant where I get more bang for my buck. 

Selection: the options for different dishes is great. But again, it's very pricey and we weren't looking to chance our entire dinner by ordering unique dishes like a Blow Torched Mackerel or Korean Style Beef Tartar.

Service: one of the hosts (a younger Asian girl), seemed a little unorganized (she came to take our order when our main waitress had already taken ours) but our other waitress (a young Caucasian girl) was on top of it. She topped up our glasses and came by to see how we were doing. I'd say she helped me make this rating one star higher because of her superb efforts. 

The kitchen seemed a bit slow as it took a little longer than 30 minutes for our food to come. Unlike other Korean/ Japanese restaurants, there weren't any appetizers or salads to start us off. 

Overall, it was kind of a rip off for the amount of food we had. I had to hold the baby the entire time, we waited a very long time for our food and the sushi was overpriced. However, the taste was great and the service was amazing so ... There's that."}
{"text":"To all my Hawaiian, Bermudian and and Canadian friends....this is the place to go if you want to experience truly \"fresh\" food. Not just sushi, but all aspects of this establishments cuisine. The owner takes up most pride in preparing only fresh food. We have traveled a fair amount and experienced great sushi and Miso ranks up there with the top spot sushi restaurants that we have experience even compared to the ones in the middle of the Pacific ocean that offers the freshest of fish. Mahalo and A hui hou!!!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here and they have been consistently great both visits. I got the same order both times, kimchi dumplings, yam green dragon roll and sushi pizza minus the salmon. 
I love that their sushi pizza is done with a tempura batter, very unique however I do not love paying full price when removing the item that makes the item cost what if does. A major suggestion is to add on a veggie sushi pizza to the menu like so many other places have. There isn't enough vegetarian options on the menu (hence getting the same three items) so I think making this change would make it feel a little less of a rip off. I mean they're already charging for rice tea and for a dipping sauce for the Chicken that my boyfriend got that should have came with a sauce to begin with. I know it seems like I should be giving less stars from what I am saying but these are suggestions for improvement. The quality of food is truly excellent. The service was fast which is always a plus. The yam rolls are spectacular, we ask for spicy mayo on them which makes them over the top good. 

I think a few tweaks to the menu to appeal to a larger audience base would make this place 5 star."}
{"text":"Worth to try. Not to impressed, but it's better than most of sushi restaurants. Some fusion dishes like shrimp rock is good."}
{"text":"I've eaten at many a sushi establishments.  I also hardly post reviews. Service was outstanding at this restaurant, and the lobster hand roll was THE BEST I have ever had.  Highly recommend, and wish the owners much success!"}
{"text":"I have already reviewed Miso however need to report that my second and third visits were equally impressive. If you can visit there when it's not that busy, you will get awesome service and a seat near the front window where they have a couple of great wooden tables. The space is very intimate and the décor is warm and modern.

The shrimp rock is always a favorite. There are 5 plump shrimp covered in an orange sauce that is the restaurants signature dish, in my estimation. The mushroom butter yaki and cod are also wonderful tapas. The sashimi romance features 15 or 28 pieces of fresh sashimi presented in an artful arrangement. It's as nice to look at as it is to eat.

The service has always been great and the owner seems to be there a lot and adds a vibrance and energy to the place. This has quickly become my favorite sushi place in Oakville. Mye's is still good but a little old school and traditional, which is OK, however better for more formal situations."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place out based on the positive ratings on yelp, and we were not disappointed. Loved the cool ambiance and vibe of the restaurant paired with the delicious food. The sushi pizza is AMAZING, as well as their specialty sushi rolls. The owners (husband & wife) are so welcoming and take the time to come over and talk to you about your experience. They also gave us recommendations for next time we come back...which will be tonight - can't wait!!!"}
{"text":"Very descent Japanese food, with super nice service and delicious cocktails. My husband and I have been there for a quick evening dinner and we were very pleased with everything. I ordered shochu cocktail (it is a Japanese spirit that you must try if you haven't yet). We also had some sushi that was pretty fresh. The prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"A fantastic evening with my buddy Neil in downtown Oakville.  The Owner/Operators have much to be proud of when serving Japanese and Korean dishes.  The sushi was fresh and delightful, mouthwatering tastes.  My taste buds were exploding with multiple flavours.  We did the Sake taste testing with our meal.  Thomas the owner was extremely helpful when pairing the sake with our sushi.  What an enjoyable time we had!  

Got to come and visit!"}
{"text":"Awful, just really awful. The food was really salty and tapas were soggy and not fresh. I complained about the food and unfortunately the owner took it personally. She came out and yelled at us for not enjoying the food. We still don't really know why, but rather than over analyzing it, a better solution is to not return and to warn others who are considering a visit. There are many great restaurants nearby that are worth a venture; no need to settle on this one."}
{"text":"So glad I happened to pop by miso! 

We chose this restaurant solely based on a parking spot that was nearby (it was snowing, ok?), and we hadn't visited it since Fin closed. I have no idea if the two are related, but Fin was an izakaya spot too! 

The restaurant hasn't changed much in appearance since the take over, but it was always a beautiful and modern space so I'm not surprised they didn't change a ton! 

The menu is extensive and everything looked good! We shared 6 tapas items including chicken karage, eggplant with beet bits, tuna tartare, shrimp rock, agedashi tofu, and kimchi dumplings. Everything was amazing, with the stand outs being the shrimp rock FOR SURE. Super delicious, giant fried shrimp with delicious sweet and spicy sauce! 

I can't wait to go back and try the beautiful sushi rolls! The couple next to us had ordered a few and they all looked soooooo awesome. 

I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, I really did!  Unfortunately I didn't.  I mean it wasn't terrible, it  was just okay.  Nothing spectacular.

As a non AYCE sushi restaurant, I really expected it to be better.  I've read many great reviews about this place and was so excited to try it.  It didn't meet my expectations only because it was very similar to an AYCE sushi restaurant (quality and flavour wise).  I feel like I would've got my money's worth at an AYCE sushi restaurant instead.

I tried the sushi pizza and it was mediocre, I found the rice to be a little over cooked and hard.

However, the volcano roll was really delicious, so I do recommend anyone going here to try it.

The service was great, super friendly even on a busy night they seemed to have everything under control.

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be coming back.  It wasn't memorable enough for me especially for the price I paid."}
{"text":"My favourite sushi in Oakville!! The owner is so sweet and makes an effort to engage with her customers. Can be pricey for dinner but their lunch time bento box specials are a great deal! I wish they were available in evenings as well - then I'd come much more frequently! Either way, great place, great staff, great atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"This sushi was amazing. I come all the way from Hamilton to have it because the places near me don't compare to this sushi!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went there yesterday and I have to say the experience was very unpleasant. 
First of all, there was a group of individuals celebrating for birthday and they were shouting all the time. The waitress and manager didn't bother to ask them to lower the volume. 
Second of all, it took us almost 45 min to get our food. During the period, no one bothered to check on us or refill our water. Instead, the waitresses were chatting in the back. 
Thirdly, after we finished our meal( seafood udon and pork stone bowl), both of us got diarrhea. Their seafood wasn't fresh at all. 
I will no go again and do not recommend this place to anyone."}
