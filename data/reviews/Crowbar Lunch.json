{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem in a city awash in mundane food options. The owners / operators, who have worked here for 40+ years, are friendlier than even the most fake 20-something server at the latest burger place, burrito joint or hotdogerie. The food is prepared well, deliciously spiced and comes in large portions. The ambiance is quaint and not for those seeking a sterile environment devoid of character. Anyone who has ever taken a road trip down to the United States and stopped along the way for some hearty food will appreciate this place. With respect to price, expect to pay about 2/3 the price that the exact same meal would cost on the Danforth or King West."}

OMG. How many times do you have to hear tales of food poisoning, dollarama ingredients (chalet bread) and anuses destroyed beyond recognition after explosive bowel movements before you realize, this dank doesn't give a damn? !!

There's no question that the chef is friendly but how is that relevant when his entire uniform is encrusted with black filth?!! Why so dirty?! I wanted to scrape an inch of that nasty soot off his palms before he put my chalet bun on my pink salmonella burger! I know of at least six tales of bathroom hardship following a crow bar lunch. And if you even try to bring uncooked food back, they have an attitude about it!! WHY?!?! Im about to have a near fatal toilet tango and YOU\"RE the one whose angry?? WHY?! I guarantee you my stomach is a trillion times more upset than you are! Why?!! when you KNO you're just gonna mash up the rest of my meal and mix it in with the other meat, slam it down on a chalet bun and serve it to the next schmek that walks in!

The fundamental problem is that the food tastes good, and its cheap.. That's what tricks people. The fries are good, but you can't really screw those up when they're under a litre of gravy!  And what does THAT even matter when everything u eat there is coming out as gravy anyway!  Too many bathrooms wrecked, too many irreparably damaged bowels... It's just not the place for me, don't go unless you wanna live on the can... Bring cottonelle, none of that dollarama 1ply toilet paper foolishness.."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for this place and it kicks butt compared to overrated, over priced, slow service breakfast spots (ahem, Petit Dejeuner). 

Yes, the exterior looks questionable and the interior is dated but this is a place that has withstood the test of time, condo developers and thankfully, they put more effort into their food than on aesthetics. Plus, the brown leather and round seats at the counter instantly take you back to the 60's. 

We sat down at a table and were greeted by a sweet old man, assumed to be the owner and ordered the breakfast special for $6.95. He quickly brought us two coffees with cream. 

I just finished fixing my cup of coffee and our food arrived! Typical breakfast with toast, eggs, sausage and Greek style home fries. Might I add that we each got FOUR sausages! 

The same man who took our order, came by to check up on us and top off our coffee. My boyfriend mentioned how good the food was and how the portions were generous and he laughed and patted him on the shoulder. 

The crowd is mixed. Obviously, many of the construction workers working across the street stop in but I also noticed a lot of 9-5ers and suits ordering breakfast and coffee to-go. 

They only take cash and debit. Preferably bring cash since I paid with debit and they charged me tax. 

I love this place. Four stars for four sausages. This is as good as greasy spoon breakfasts gets."}
