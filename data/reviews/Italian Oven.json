{"text":"10 stars if I could!! Excellent service even though there are no servers. Can't wait to go back. Very friendly staff.  Couldn't ask for better food!!!  Great to bring back the Italian Oven tradition from years ago!!!"}
{"text":"Food is incredible and people are super friendly! Also the place is clean, and cool. We are on our way to DC and happy to have found this place via Yelp. Thanks fellow yelper for your helpful reviews."}
{"text":"This is not the old Italian Oven and that is NOT a good thing! I went there expecting to have a nice relaxing meal with bread, pasta and salad. What I got was the fast food experience. Gone are the sit-down tables, waitstaff, and butcher paper covered tables and all the charm. It is now a fast food place like Noodles, you stand in line, order your food and it brought out to you. The restaurant itself has no charm, there are a few tables and a long high-top much like the industrial look of a Choliple. We ordered, eat and left all within 20 minutes. It's not the kind of place you relax at and talk over coffee and cake after your meal, it is get in and get out.

The food was good, but I wish it was more like the old Italian Oven!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to order food for takeout.. Sign on door they have closed .. Very sad really liked there food I thought they where doing well.  Owner was always cheerful like nothing was wrong. Wish I knew would have been willing to invest in Restaurant"}
{"text":"We ordered lasagna. It came round. They bake it in muffin tins. The serving size was small. The noodles were chewy. The sauce was tasty. It could of had more ricotta cheese too. The meal came with a small piece of garlic flatbread. A salad was extra. You have to place your order before you sit down. They seemed disorganized. You also have to get your own dishes, napkins, and silverware. I noticed a cook playing with her ponytail and then made a pizza without washing her hands. Another couple got lasagna and sent theirs back because it was cold. They brought the man's back quickly, but the woman had to wait about 10 minutes longer for hers. The pizza is made on flatbread. This place would be ok for a snack or light lunch. You might have to order 2 pizzas to get enough to eat."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, and tasty!  We have a young child so ordering at the door before being seated was a plus.  The pizza was delicious and the ingredients were fresh.  We tried the \"soon to be famous meatballs\" and loved them.  The price was right too!  We will definitely be coming back for more pizza."}
{"text":"They are CLOSED. Nice while it lasted. 

Just returned for another meal and it's just as tasty. Get the fried zucchini and an extra marinara!  Just fantastic food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Took the family here and we really enjoyed it. You order at cafeteria style stations, then they quickly make the food and bring it out to you.  From order to eating took less than 5 minutes and the food was delicious. My wife and I had the ravioli and the kids had pizzas."}
{"text":"This place is quick, fresh and affordable! They have pasta, pizza, and salad stations where you choose and order, then your meal is delivered.  Its pretty much self serve however they do bus the tables, no tip required! Great iced tea and tiramisu! Salads are fresh and dressing are amazing! Great spot for lunch away from the office!!"}
{"text":"Nice place to stop in if you need your Italian and in a hurry. Very good good food, nice variety of options."}
{"text":"Yummmm! Fresh hand prepared and cut Italian noodles with your choice of pasta sauce. The taste has such an authentic feel to it and I really enjoyed my dish. I had the noodles with bolognese sauce. Not too oily and heavy, I was fully satisfied with my meal once I was finished."}
{"text":"I have been to Italian Oven twice, both times including my kids. I found the food to be excellent. Once you figure out how the ordering is done, it's very simple. Prices and the wait time for the food were both very reasonable. The kids devoured their pizzas. My mushroom pizza was superb. The major downfall both visits was the host. He is at best annoying and at worst, totally sexist. The restaurant makes little bags for kids with a noodle necklace/ bracelet-making \"kit.\" On both occasions, the host has only given one to my daughter and not to my son. The first time I asked for one for my son. The second time I asked him why he hadn't offered one to my son. He said, \"Because it's a girly thing.\" I explained that it certainly is not and that if my son were not interested we could politely refuse the activity but that it wasn't very nice to exclude him or make assumptions about his interests. Frankly, stringing noodles is an activity ANY child would enjoy. And what kind of an insensitive restaurant offers a kids' activity for one gender and not the other?! On the second occasion when this happened I spoke to the manager about the host's bias. I will return to this establishment again, but if my son is not offered the kids' activity on my third visit, this restaurant will lose this customer for good."}
{"text":"90s Italian Oven Restaurant food, fast casual modern atmosphere. Most of the pizza and pastas are at the $8.00 price point, best bang for your buck for quick Italian food. No tipping."}
{"text":"Great new addition to the Monroeville area. We received a warm greeting upon entering by the proprietor and explained the fast casual concept. Ordered, paid, meal was delivered within several minutes which is perfect when dining with children or a quick lunch break! There are chef selections to choose from and you can also create your own pasta, pizza and salad selections. Fresh, high quality ingredients for a very reasonable price and although there is no dedicated server (or tipping) quality checks were performed and I was impressed to see how engaged management was with the guests."}
{"text":"Concept is a little strange and the food was so-so. I wouldn't suggest this place for dinner, but I would for lunch. They do use Home Depot buckets for bus tubs  which is a little strange,  along with their bizarre signage about children I just didn't get it.  All in all I would give it a try like I said lunch more so than dinner."}
{"text":"We stopped at this place during our road trip. Amazing food, clean place fabulous staff and very reasonably priced place. We ordered bunch of different type of topping pizza and all of them were tasty. Wish they had Italian Oven in the DC metro area."}
{"text":"It's great to see the Italian Oven back in action even though it is a completely different format and menu.  The food was good for fast casual Italian and I was so happy to have their fried zucchini again.  

They have three different stations; a pasta station, pizza station and salad station and it created a bit of chaos as there were a lot of people in line who were all ordering different things but the line merged together as one big line.  It would be much easier if you place your order with one person instead of three, pay, sit down and let them bring the food to your table.  Instead, my husband and I handed in 5 slips from the various stations that we visited when we paid.  It was a waste of paper and hectic to say the least.  

Once we were seated we enjoyed our food and the time we spent there.  I certainly would go back and maybe even order ahead next time."}
{"text":"The food here for my was ok. The food is served very quickly and the staff is always friendly, but it is not my favorite place. I feel that it is a little overpriced, at least for lunch. The food is good and fresh and they have some unique takes on salads and pizzas. Just was not very impressed with it over all."}
{"text":"Another great meal for my out of town friends over the holidays! We all went and had different pizzas and pastas and shared.  
The place is fast -casual, you order and pay and then the great food kept rolling onto our table.
Having the beer and wine made for a perfect night!!"}
{"text":"Italian Oven remade into a fast, healthy choice for pasta, pizza and sandwiches. Love the concept of Italian food with fast service. You order at the counter and they deliver the food to your table. The menu gives you a choice of creating your own dish (build a pasta or pizza) or you may choose one of their favorite combos. Build a pasta gives you a choice of rigatoni, whole wheat organic penne, or spaghetti. Next pick one of five sauces (I love the Tomato Vodka). Add a protein--the Soon to Be Famous meatballs are delicious! Finally, you can add up to three toppings from a list of 12 including: mushrooms, Kalamata olives, prosciutto, roasted red peppers, etc. You pick up your silverware and fill your drinks from the soda fountain. The food comes out quickly and is fresh and delicious. The price can't be beat--the items are all $7.77, with some upgrades like shrimp having a small up-charge. Their No Tipping policy gives added value. They bus the tables after you leave. Overall, a nice change from fast food fair without sacrificing your wallet."}
{"text":"Great and friendly staff who were so pleasant and took the time to explain the menu to us. I think they could tell we were pretty lost when we walked in, but they were very helpful in lending us some suggestions. 

We ordered a lot of food. I tried the soup, pizza, and had pasta. We also order the zucchini as an appetizer and my husband also got a pizza for himself. What can I say, we wanted to try everything! They were pretty dead when we got there, but the food came out before I was able to even put my coat on the chair. Oh yeah, we also got Tiramisu for dessert! It was OK. 

The meals were hot, plentiful, and had lots of flavor. It is set up sort of like a Panera bread, where you order at the counter and then pay at the end. They bring the food out to you once it is ready and there is no need to tip. I think my favorite was the pizza, followed by the pasta. You really can't go wrong at this place and if you are in a hurry that won't be an issue either because everything comes out so fast. It is nice to see a new business in this area of Monroeville and, although it did not quite reminding of the old Italian oven, it definitely has potential. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Some people, like Tito K. will like to tell you that this place isn't all that great. I would tell people like him that they simply don't appreciate quality food and service. Italian Oven delivers on both of these fronts. The staff is top notch and so is the food. Order the #4, it won't let you down. I would have showed you a picture but I ate it too fast. That is all."}
{"text":"What a wonderful treat. Stopped off the highway driving from MI to VA for what we thought would be just pizza. Well I did get pizza--ricotta and meatball and it was creamy and exceeded expectations. The rest of the family had pasta-one shrimp one chicken. Lots of choices as far as vegetables, sauces, meats etc.  Very good value. Wish they had one near me!"}
{"text":"This place offers a solid take on quick, fresh, Italian food. You order before you seat yourself and then they bring your food to you. The menu has \"create yours\" options for pizza, pasta and salads, as well as a regular menu.

The service was a little spotty and the cashier was very distracted and didn't smile once. That turned me off, but whatever. The food came out quickly and it was very fresh. We only ordered salads because of gluten and soy allergies, but they were very good. The place smells great and everything that came out of the kitchen looked good, but not very special. Come here for fast, decent, well-priced Italian fare, but don't expect to be blown away. Im not sure I will come back, but give it a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"wolf it down!  the pizzas are small and individualized but the oven-fired taste and quality toppings are well worth the price.  quick, personalized service and a nice, comforting layout are pluses for this new addition to the Monroeville dining scene.  we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"There's really not much to not like about Italian Oven.

The entire aesthetic is really neat. You walk in and immediately enter into the patio room that is a bit more quiet than the main dining room. They have large garage style windows that they open when it's nice out, and there's a fake fireplace lit against an exposed brick wall. It's a nice little room for a girls night or date night.

The next room is big and brightly lit, but it is where the magic happens! 

There are three stations - and follow this closely in case Jeff isn't there to greet you - the first station is for PASTA, and wow do they serve pasta. They have their own signature dishes which are displayed on the TV monitors behind the station, or you can create your own. I would also suggest that you grab a bowl of meatballs. They have chicken or beef meatballs and you get three large meatballs in a bowl, topped with a whipped ricotta cheese.

While those are being created, head over to the PIZZA station. I think this one is my favorite station. You can also create your own, but they have some incredible artisan pizza also on the monitor behind. My favorite pizza is the Portobello & Wild Mushroom because they use their 6-cheese blend and truffle oil. Now I'm not really supposed to eat dairy products, but I cheat on myself every time I come to IO and get pizza! My other favorite: Prosciutto & Fig Jam. Yep, you heard me. Fig jam, topped with arugula prosciutto, cheese, pistachios and a delicious balsamic glaze. I'd marry it if I could.

All of the pizzas can be a personal pizza if you try hard enough and believe in yourself.

Then, as your pizza is baking, you reach the SALAD line. Guess what? The signature salads are listed on the TV monitor behind the station. I never get salad at IO because I have a problem and it's called \"Pizza Addiction,\" but I did get the chance to try the Pizza Insalata. It's literally a salad atop garlic flatbread. It's unreal the way the flatbread absorbs the Italian dressing from the salad. It's not right, but it's more than okay.

They have one of those Coke Freestyle machines so you can get a standard soda or mix and match flavors. They also carry San Pellegrino cans that you can buy if you'd like a drink, aside from the free water. I also tried the boxed water that they sell there and wouldn't you know, it was water but in a box!

We went for a girls night recently and brought our own bottle of red to enjoy with our pizza. I think the corkage fee was under $2 each and they also provided the glasses.

Honestly, the food is great and the price is right. I don't see how anyone could miss out on it."}
{"text":"Really good quick Italian food! Pizzas, specials and salads are my favorite. Great staff too, always really friendly."}
{"text":"Unfortunately they just announced they will be closing.  


Freshly prepared Italian food. Salads, pizza, pasta. All prepared fast. This place is perfect
for lunch.  You select the ingredients and the servers prepare your select fast and fresh."}
{"text":"I like these type of restaurants. You pick your dish, ingredients, sit down and wait for them to get it for you. Not bad. 

For a sunday afternoon, this place was dead. 
The interior has a 50s style and, mostly likely, Ikea furnishings is what you'll find inside. Lots of white with solid colors and a stone wall. 

It's a great idea. $7.77 for a sizable salad, 5 free ingredients after lettuce and $2 for steak, salmon or shrimp. I got salmon, a small piece but  reasonable for $2!
They also have pastas and pizza.

No changing table in their large, one person, bathrooms."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere. The food was very fresh and expertly prepared. I like the order then sit down method. The owner/chef was very personable and was making sure everyone was taken care of.  My kids loved the food and they are 8 and 9 yrs. old.  It's great for a quick lunch or even a more relaxed dinner. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars, NOT because I think it's some great fancy Italian Eatery but because they go for the low cost - fast casual Italian dining option, and at that standard I feel that they successfully live up to it.    I feel if you want a pasta, pizza, or Italian salad for under $10 and dinner in just a few minutes this is a place that you can't go wrong. 

The service is alright, again it's fast casual so I hold them to a standard slightly above fast food so I am putting the bar relatively low.   

Check it out for a quick option for dinner if you want to avoid fast food and have hit the nearby Panera too much recently."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and well crafted. My only negative is that meals very rarely get to the table at the same time, so one person usually has to end up waiting. That being said, my husband and I go here for lunch regularly and it makes a great \"fast food\" alternative for dinner on crazy weeknights."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Gibsonia! You can customize your pizza, pasta, and salads. They have lots of delicious and different options for toppings. The staff is very friendly. I love their wedding soup- and I'm very picky about wedding soup! All of the ingredients they use are super fresh. It's great if you want something quick since its counter service. Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"We normally have a great experience at this location but today's service was a big disappointment. We ordered two salads. We were helped by a younger associate who took our order. We were informed they were out of tomatoes, obviously that's an important part of our salads. They were also out of salmon. We were told to wait at a table and they would bring over our order. We waited twenty minutes before we got out food in a bear empty restaurant. The worst part was that we waited the entire time in a crazy hot restaurant because their air conditioner was broken. Associates were standing around and talking while we waited. Guests came and went while we still waited...for salads. Potentially the worst part was the horrible service, it seemed like no one was in charge. We come here often and have always had great service and great food. We will most likely not return, very poorly run."}
{"text":"Great new option in Gibsonia. As someone else mentioned this is fresh food, made fast. Try the prosciutto with fig jam. So good. And the meatballs are very, very good.  

There's a small outdoor eating area as well. 

We've been there three or four times now. Considering we're otherwise trapped in greasy fast food hell up here, the Italian Oven is much appreciated."}
{"text":"Food is prepared quickly yet tastes great, much like what you would get at a full service restaurant. Prices are very moderate for the quality and quantity of the food. Owner is very on top of things like quality of the food and cleanliness of the restaurant as I've witnessed on 3 separate visits. Definitely worth the stop in for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Tried out this place one of the first days it was open.  They weren't on YELP yet so here we go ... Everything was overpriced.  Ordered a chicken salad which arrived without the chicken.  I told the owner about it (he was wandering around making sure everyone was ok) and he came back with a little plate of sliced chicken (that you'd normally put on a sandwich).  It wasn't good.  I was starving afterwards.  My husband ordered some kind of pasta dish which looked good.  He wasn't pleased or displeased with it.  Really confused on the atmosphere of this place.  Is it a fast food place with slow food?  I won't go back.  Waste of my money."}
{"text":"It's like the subway of pizzas. Awesome concept for brick oven pizza. Personal pan pizzas reasonably priced and all authentic fresh ingredients. They provide crushed red pepper and Parmesan for added flavor"}
{"text":"This is a new place so allowances must be made.....   Upon entering a member of staff MUST explain how to order because there is a lack of signs anywhere.   The staff behind the counters serving is exceedingly young and disinterested.  By the look on their faces and their demeanor as they spoke to me, they would have rather been someplace else, anyplace else.  My order and that of my companion were wrong and had to be remade.

For an Italian fast food concept, service was not so fast --- all that complex instruction at the entrance slowed everyone down.

The food was passable but needs a lot of improvement.   There is simply no passion here."}
{"text":"Beautiful new addition to barren dining scene in Monroeville. The space is big with open seating and everyone can order what they want. Fast, and delicious - Italian oven is everything you want and more! Fresh ingredients on inventive pizza, pasta and salads. I got the portobello truffle oil pizza with a side salad which was delicious - and generous portion! I'm so excited to return with friends."}
{"text":"The layout definitely needs better, clearer signs.  We got fried zucchini and while it came out fast it was the blandest we've ever had.  There was no flavor to the breading t tasted like flour.  The pizza was pretty good but in general it's confusing and disorganized."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from the Italian Oven.  The ordering stations are a little different, but was not confusing as others had stated.  Salads are good and the pizza insalada came on top of garlic bread.  We had a chicken spinach pizza that was very good as well.  We ordered fried zuccini that came with a good horseradish sauce and lots of lightly breaded ziccini.  This is a good spot right on 22 in the heart of Monroeville."}
{"text":"I really want to LOVE this place, because seriously the food at Italian Oven is incredible and the atmosphere is very clean and cool. However this place has let me down again and again due to service.

How you order is super confusing, especially if it's your first time. You order certain things at certain stations but the problem is there is no good signage for where to order what. People constantly go to the wrong place and the employees get snappy because they are frustrated with having to repeat themselves.

Also, they attempt to use a number system on papers to organize order but frankly it's a hot mess. Typically employees will just go table to table carrying around a dish and ask if it belonged to them. Super disorganized. I've filled out feedback cards multiple times yet it's seemed to be worse each time I go with the busier it is. 

Hopefully this place sorts out its bugs because the food is great and the chef that runs it and a super friendly guy."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. My wife and I both for soup, drinks, and entrees and the total was $30 and change. You got the try the pizza here too, so good. Actually, try everything slowly. I know I will."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the friendly atmosphere.  The food was yummy and prices were very reasonable.  We have leftovers for another meal.  Highly recommend!"}
