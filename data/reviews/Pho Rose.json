{"text":"It was good. I've had better, but it was close  and convenient at the time. Worth a try"}
{"text":"My brother & I was driving on our way to the gym at night and we decided to stop by this place to grab something to eat. It was my first time so I did not know what to order but Pho Rose menu offered different variety of dishes. My eye caught the \"Grilled Chicken & Rice\" dish so i decided to give it a shot. It didn't take long to get the food that I wanted which was approximately 3-6min. I was really impressed how much food there was in my plate! The food was really delicious for a decent affordable price. I am willing to come back next time again!"}
{"text":"Probably the only Pho place in the Northwest side of town. Wish they could build more since this place isn't the friendliest. Even though I have been here several times, I have always ordered to-go and every time I come by they never say \"Hi or Bye or Thank you or not even a Come again.\" But I do come back since I don't want to drive to Chinatown. 

Okay now to the food...I usually order the Pho with rare steak and with extra tripe for $7.95 and the spring rolls with the peanut sauce is probably my favorite at this place. As for the Chinese food I would rate it as A-O-K, I've had better. 

I would only recommend this place if you really don't want to drive to Chinatown and your better off ordering to go."}
{"text":"The owner is a crook!!!! I dropped some money and now she can't speak english all of a sudden after taking my order!!! She pocketed my money so I didn't pay nor tip. Of course she did not follow me because she was wrong!
Now on to the food........ Pricy for these small portions, and the taste is nothing close to what they are trying to sell. If this is your first asian place. please try somewhere else before you judge asian food. This is not my first nor last asian/Pho restaurant...."}
{"text":"I've been going there for 8+ years now.  It's not what my mom makes, but it pretty good!"}
{"text":"People--don't go here if you want an exuberant, bubbly, annoying waitress who wants to act like you've been friends for years. Get over the fact that this isn't Joe's Crab Shack. The woman you complain about comes from a different culture...just accept her and enjoy the delicious food she will bring you. I've been going here since they opened, which is at least 10 years ago, maybe 15. She actually is very sweet and nice. I'm half-Chinese, if that means anything, and I think the food is really good, especially for a local place. So, go for the food, not the ambiance and give this place a fair shake. They are good people."}
{"text":"Not your traditional pho noodle house.  Broth was bland and meat smells old from sitting out too long.  Worst was my Vietnamese coffee had tons of small little ants at the bottom of cup..they said it was leftover coffee ground! Yeah right, coffee grounds with little limbs! Disgusting! Never come back!"}
{"text":"Great place for pho but the staff isn't really a people person. I have only ordered take out and never ate in, but I would go back again if I am in the area"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Service not the best. But the food is worth it. I love them. We have been eating there for 13 yrs and the same great taste. Combo noodle soup. Orange chicken best we've ever had."}
{"text":"We have been going to Pho Rose for 6 years now and for being a local (mostly) Vietnamese restaurant, pretty darn good! The chef is Vietnamese and Chinese while his wife is Vietnamese, so they're definitely authentic.  I've certainly had better pho, but we live in the heart of Summerlin and nothing's that good that im going to drive 20 more minutes to satisfy a craving;  Pho Rose will certainly suffice. This place is definitely \"mom and pop\" so dont come in expecting great service and ambiance; we come here for the food. It's like going to NYC or SF and expecting polite conversation from our fav chinese take-out. Its not gonna happen, so just order your food and enjoy. If you want customer service, there's a Cheesecake Factory or PF Changs down the road to meet your superficial needs.  

We have take-out at least once a week (usually Pho Rare Steak or Beef Vermicelli and fried egg rolls). Their beef vermicelli is hands down some of the best I've had! The lean meat is marinated in a lemongrass marinade with just the right fixing of romaine lettuce, vermicelli, bean sprouts, topped with chopped peanuts and fried and green onions seasoned with nuoc cham and chili paste. With regard to the pho, there are days when the broth is too fresh (yes, too fresh) and the flavors havent integrated all too well yet, but i cant give a bad review for that. It happens. For the most part, they consistently have good broth that's well balanced without one spice overwhelming the other. They use good, tender steak and their herbs are always fresh.  I love how people whine about the price--I mean really? What do you expect? If you think that's too steep a price to have someone make a 16+hr broth, find good sirloin or filet mignon, and fresh thai basil served in a pretty generous bowl, then go get yourself a family meal at KFC if you're looking for a deal. UN-freakinbelievable! 

I love how most of the bad reviews are from \"Westerners\" that have the audacity to critique cuisine as if theyre an expert on asian food when it sounds nothing more than a trendy claim to say \"yeah! ive had it before\" during their next attempt at foodie conversation. Im Asian and i am no novice when it comes to Vietnamese food and my husband is French/Vienamese so he's been eating it forever, so I feel our review is worth it's weight in gold. To reiterate, not THE best ever, but if you live in the area, it'll satisfy the craving if you're not up for the Chinatown drive. 

Note: Don't recommend ordering Pho take-out unless you know how to reheat and plate correctly. Otherwise, the noodles and meat will get tough."}
{"text":"Good food but no delivery soups are awesome padi Thai very good but they need to freakin deliver REALLY it's 2015 your business would explode cuz your food is on point"}
{"text":"Good Mom and Pap  pho house. New to veitnemese cuisine and was very pleased with the overall quality food and service. Im all about supporting the family businesses."}
{"text":"Good Vietnamese. Pho is good. Chops are a bit fatty at times, but all around very good. Vietnamese eggrolls are top 10 for vegas."}
{"text":"That waitress has to go...back in where evere she came from, what such a bad attitude towards customers whos actually putting food in her table."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their General Tso's Chicken! Its the best I've had in a long time and my favorite in town. My other favorite here is the Dry Vermicelli with Grill Pork. The grill pork is to die for.

They also have a good variety of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes to choose from. My family usually complimented how their food always taste like home cook in a good way.

I agree with the smile, but hey as long they provide you with good food and great price, its all good. After all, this is just a small family business."}
{"text":"Had the Beef pho and the broth just didn't taste like regular pho. Wife had the vermicelli  that had only two pieces of meat and all lettuce. Thai tea tasted like water. It was ok for the price but nothing special about this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Amazing food!  One of our families favorite place to eat or order out.  Some of our favorites are chicken fried rice, egg rolls, spring rolls, shrimp salad, and of course pho.  The owners are always nice and recognize us every time.  A true gem of Vegas!"}
{"text":"You can find better pho elsewhere. Broth is bland, like it was prepared out of the package. Service was terrible, especially when I was the only one eating there. Not worth going to again. The oil in the broth is a plus, but even that wasn't enough for me to come back for more."}
{"text":"Was looking for the nearest Pho' for a cold Sunday night. Found this from Yelp. Ordered to go. 
Pho Broth was not authentic. Tasted more like an overkill garlic soup. Spring rolls/ peanut sauce was tasty. 

Would drive outta my way to find a better place."}
{"text":"I've had better Pho in countless other places. They only have one size and the broth wasn't that great. None of their options had brisket. I have honestly made far better Pho at home."}
{"text":"Wow.  Horrible. Got Kung pao chicken.  Zero taste  consisted of a pound of celery and chicken floating in some brown sauce that had zero taste it was all I could do to swallow the celery only.  Egg rolls were just as bad tasted like frozen freezer smell. Place looked beat up and dirty.  I would never go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"Loved the beef salad. It was very tasty and delicious. I couldn't even finish it, great size!  It had beef, daikon, lettuce, cucumbers and carrots and the dressing was yummy! The lunch special prices were great! I would go back just for this salad!"}
{"text":"I got the General's Chicken, so nothing Vietnamese or even authentic Chinese, but it was really good, reasonably priced and very fresh. When I walked in, they were pretty busy but I still got my food pretty fast. I will be back."}
{"text":"I've gone here twice food was OK however I was disappointed both times with service therefore I will not go back. The cashier (older Asian lady) I've seen each visit has No people skills, if it is a communication barrier, she should place someone at counter with a personality/smile & who knows,how interact with ALL types of customers as the location is very racially mixed area. I walked in 35 min. Prior to closing and asked if I could dine in, wanted pho. There was maybe 5 empty tables and 4 tables occupied w/people of Asian decent. I was told it was 2 close to closing..in other words..she did not want to serve me. I left very disappointed and wouldn't want anyone to feel like I did as this is 2017. All races support her business she should treat people equally!"}
{"text":"PHO was amazing in my top 3 of places in Las Vegas if your ever in the Buffalo and Vegas drive you got to try it"}
{"text":"This was the one of the first Vietnamese eateries we experienced upon arriving to Las Vegas some 10 years ago.   I am not sure if ownership has changed since, but we could not find the dish we normally order available. So we decided on some other options for which we were also told were not available.  Our server placed her finger on the menu and informed us what was and what wasn't available. 

I went for a grilled chicken and eggroll vermicelli bowl which was okay and the portion was also big. The meal was pleasant but compared to some of my other favorite Vietnamese restaurants, this place took a back seat. 

The place is located in a small business strip and the restaurant itself looks to have seen better days but the service was pleasant."}
{"text":"This spot is located near my work, and I've occasionally dropped in for takeout. The pho, as many other reviews state, is extremely unremarkable. Surprisingly, the lunch specials and chinese dishes seem to be where this place does best.

Lunch specials are $6 for a main, rice, and a cheese wonton- the beef and broccoli was surprisingly good, with tons of FRESH broccoli instead of the usual flavorless, frozen kind. The spring rolls are okay, always fresh and decently filled. 

The vermicelli/bun dishes are just okay: meats are bland, minimal veggies used. When grabbing to go, this is crammed into a takeout box that makes it difficult to mix. Would like to see them put these in a plastic container with a lid, like a salad, instead. Overall, pretty average."}
{"text":"Tap water is better than Pho in this place. We ordered Chicken Pho and it came with a huge amount of garlic in it. We added all the sauces that were on the table to reduce the flavor of garlic in that soup. Horrible taste! Customer service: lady came without even say hi to take our order. She seemed mad. It's cheap but not good at all."}
{"text":"The food is really good so hat's off to the chef! Service is bad but I have been going there for a while and now used to this lady and know that she is just this way."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come once in a blue moon when we're craving pho. This is hands down the best pho in town. I've tried other pho restaurants around town but nothing compares to their pho. The broth is what makes the pho it's great quality for a good price."}
{"text":"My son and I ordered the Pho noodle soup, the meat was very fatty and the broth was average.  The noodles were sort of clumped in the middle and I felt that the prices were too high for the quality...both my son and I had belly aches all afternoon after eating here...never again!!!!!"}
{"text":"I REALLY wanted to love this place because it is close but sadly the pho was a bit too oily or fatty for me.  It was good flavor and clean and I hope they stay in business but they seem not busy.  Worth trying out--I am just so used to the flavor of my pho place.  Sadly I haven't been back there in a while--not even for Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"Good food and service but I wish they had more Vietnamese entrées.
I have had takeout orders from Pho Rose for over 6 years and it's definitely my favorite.  I like that it never has too much traffic so I can get my to go and get out.  It has a pleasant family atmosphere and convenient location.
I wish they had more menu items.  Any time I have ever ordered Pho at other restaurants I've had the option to also have Vietnamese sandwiches, so it is a disappointment they lack that item."}
{"text":"I always like going here. It's a ma and pa noodle place that has one of the best beef broths I have tasted. The food is always good. The chicken friend rice is not your normal fried rice but it's for the better. There is just something about it that makes it better then the rest. My only complaints are no fountain drinks. And the service can get slow the busier it gets. Definitely a local business I love to support."}
{"text":"I like that the owners are the people running the show. I can see how they can get buried sometimes and it might take a little longer than other places but worth it food is cool. Happy I don't have go to china town to get pho homie!"}
{"text":"The place is clean and the staff is nice, but the Pho was just ok. Not bad at all, but the broth tasted like beef boullion without that tangy-sweet flavor.
The prices are quite reasonable. The pho with flank steak, tendon, tripe, and beef balls was $7.50."}
{"text":"I came here since it's close by to where I work but I was better off going anywhere else . I got the chicken lo mein and it was by far the most flavorless food I have had in my entire life . It was so bland I couldn't even eat it . The customer service was good but based off food it was not worth it . Sadly I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten anything there but the Pho and Spring Rolls  and I like it. It's close to my house and the service is good. I like the Mom and Pop feel of this place and how they always know what I want before I even order - I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Worst pho ever!!! Don't ever come here , if you don't wanna waste your money!!! They give you very little meat on your pho, specially the grilled beef. People who thinks that this is a good place to eat , haven't been to any pho restaurants around the valley. The owner is rude too! The soup taste like it's mix with water."}
{"text":"I've been trying to explore Summerlin now as it is my new territory while I'm at work.  Since I haven't had Vietnamese in awhile, I decided to try this little place since it's around the corner from my job.

I usually get the cold rice vermicelli bowl with grilled pork and an egg roll - pretty straightforward and really, really hard to botch.

Well, it was pretty much botched.  -_-

The only reason this place gets any kind of stars is their grilled pork is to DIE for.  Now why would I only give it two stars?  You get about two pieces for your ENTIRE bowl.  And not like, LARGE pieces - normal sized bowl pieces.  Everything else is mediocre vermicelli, some carrots and bean sprouts, and an OBNOXIOUS amount of lettuce.

Still hoping for the best, I tried the egg roll.  Last time I checked, egg rolls shouldn't be rubbery.  How does that happen?  I really don't know.

Fish sauce was not on par, it tasted like it was old.  In fact, everything but the pork tasted old... and I got this around lunchtime.  Eck.

Very tiny inside and I had to ask 3 times to get some hoisin sauce.  I tried getting sriracha as well but I guess there was a communication snafu.  The lady was friendly.

Still shopping around for a good Vietnamese place in Summerlin."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I will give credit to Pho Rose for trying to bring Vietnamese Cuisine to the West-side of Las Vegas when most of the Pho places are located in China Town and South area.  This place is bleh if you want to satisfy your cravings if you do not want to drive a distance and you live in the close vicinity.  (if you are willing to sacrifice quality and value)

However my concern is price value to quantity.  The prices are reasonable for what it should be, but for the amount of meat?  Mind you this is not just a Vietnamese place...for goodness sake it's in the name \"PHO\" Rose...so shouldn't they focus on Pho?  My gosh...I have ordered a Combo to go, and boy were they stingy with the pieces.  We don't pay for the rice noodles to just fill you up...common, it is no wonder this place has a sad rating.  I am actually surprise TETSURO P. gave such a high 5 stars...must be a relative of the owner...or he must be ________ (fill in the blank)  I hope Tetsuro was being sarcastic, cause you will find better Pho in Utah than here!

The broth is respectable and passes for okay.  but like I said Pho Rose fails to deliver even mediocre levels of appreciation.  It really is sad to see such a place fail...when it could actually be something good.  Not only do the ratings here on yelp speak for it self...but take a visit...the place is practically empty even on peak hours.  You know a place is good if you have people waiting to be served and they are out the door.  This place...I wouldn't waste my time/  I would rather drive further and satisfy my Pho Cravings the right way...heck I am even willing to pay more as long as it is done right and a place like this doesn't BS you a sorry excuse for what they call PHOod! I wish I could give this place a negative star."}
{"text":"Still Pho rose, same place I came for real pho and I had the spring rolls and orange chicken and the rice fell out and that's the review!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, but the restaurant was very dirty the floor  looked like it has never been moped there was spider webs on a chandelier windows very dirty,and the condiment tray was disgusting,  services very poor. Instead of a tip I should've left a gallon of clorox.I would go back if they clean, because food was good enough to eat."}
{"text":"Okay, I admit that this isn't the best place for pho.  I've avoided this place for the past 2 years since we moved to this area because of the negative reviews.  However, on a whim and because I feel like Viet Biestro which is nearby (while good but over-priced to get pho w/added veggies) we tried it and were pleasantly surprised!  The cold noodle dish with bbq pork is amazing!  I wish there was more pork.  I want a giant plate of the bbq.  

I've been searching for pho restaurants that serve delicious, char-grilled grilled pork like my favorite spot, but for some reason no place ever serves it actually grilled, with grill marks. Every places I've been to has been pan fried which just isn't the same. So this is the place for me to get my sweet, tender, and delicious, char-grilled pork cravings fulfilled.  Also, their moo shoo is really good."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever. Yes I work in the industry on the strip so I might be picky, but please and THANK YOU are mandatory in every, venue, country and language!!! The main lady that works the restaurant is so rude. They should be so lucky to survive in their noodle world with so much competition around them. Read your reviews lady! Can't complain about food quality, portions are definitely cut down compared to any other Pho place."}
{"text":"I had the chicken rice noodle soup! very good considering i have a cold. and the price was ok.  i just thought that the waitress could have put my left over soup in the to go bowl for me......i spilt a little........yea the soup was great!"}
{"text":"First and foremost, I am from Oakland, Ca, home of the best Pho this side of Vietnam!! So I know what Im talkin about.
The chicken pho broth was salty and oily and they attempted to mask the bad flavor with an extra heaping portion of chopped garlic. Didn't do the job. The other person at the table had bbq chicken vermicelli and the chicken tasted like reheated burger king chicken tendors while the noodles had a plastic, almost musty flavor to them.  
The side of pho fixins came equipped with old browning bean sprouts and basil. Definitely no where near any of the decent pho spots on Spring Mountain. If you live on the North side of town and want good pho, it is definitely worth skipping Pho Rose and driving, or taking the bus, to Spring Mountain.
Defenitely Not Worth The Prices!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. I should've posted this a while ago but now that I'm more active on Yelp I remembered that I should to let people know how horrible this place is. If you can drive the extra few miles to go to Chinatown, do it! I can't believe this place is still in business. 

My gripe was with the waitress who I assume is also the owner judging from the reviews. I went in there by myself to get a quick bite to eat. It was completely empty. I ordered my usual pho and I requested no cilantro. When it came out, low and behold, there was cilantro everywhere. When I mentioned this, she became irate and told me to pick it out myself because she was busy. At this time, there was 1 other couple in the entire restaurant! How busy can you possibly be? Oh and by the way, I'm allergic to cilantro! So picking it out of my soup is actually not an option! I made her make me a new one. She said fine. Talk about a stick up your ass! 

I can't even tell you if the pho was any good because I was so pissed off. Do yourself a favor and skip this place."}
{"text":"Always come here for lunch cause my work is close here. I always order the same thing cause i never get tired of it. They have one of the best beef pho and i also took my family here and they love it. The servings are plenty and they serve it fast."}
{"text":"I like there V6 Pho Dac Biet , and there Vermicelli ( v36 Bun Bo nuong ).
Every-time , I attended this restaurant, I only like to order this two items.
Delicious Foods !!!
Service friendly!!!"}
{"text":"Pho was good I like the portion size and? flavor. Also did the egg rolls which were small but descent. Also had the vermicelli with grilled beef it was solid too. Service is traditional style felt like a spot in Vancouver not too big and fancy just clean and simple. Prices were very fair I will return in the near future. Beats Steiners next door which I've been going to for a while."}
{"text":"I have been trying so hard to find a decent pho place in the northwest forever now and keep getting let down. I was initially excited hoping I found a hole in the wall but boy was I mistaken! Let me start by saying the atmosphere is quite what you would expect from a hole in the wall... questionable. The spring rolls and crab ragoon were pretty good actually , so would recommend these appetizers. I got the combo pho but it wasn't really a combo. It was basically steak pho but they threw in 1 meatball and 1 tendon.....totally dissapointing. My sister got the rare steak phone but it was well done.... wouldn't doubt if it was all in the same pot. Nonetheless the broth itself was pretty flavorful and good. The BIGGEST TURNOFF and why I will never be back is my sister and I got water and there was a TON of floaties in it!!! GROSS GROSS GROSS..... shocked I didn't get sick won't be back!"}
{"text":"The pho is decent, the soup is a little bland, 3 stars for that, but no service at all? Gonna drop it to 2 stars. One of the place with the least amount of service I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"Not a very busy restaurant. So you have to ask yourself if the food is fresh at all? 

I ate the combination Pho noodles and I was the only one there so it kinda made me uncomfortable. I ate quickly as I can and left accordingly. 

And still to this day. Everytime I drive by the place I see the restaurant empty. Makes you wonder if they are making money? Or how are they still in business?  

Overall the food is not bad. But at the same time it's not great either. It's really not authentic tasting as I have been to Vietnam before"}
{"text":"This place is really good. Small restaurant, large menu, great flavors. My favorite is the shrimp over vegetables and vermicelli and the shrimp rolls. Everything seems fresh (i don't know if they are but whatever). Definitely recommend for a quick and great place to chow down."}
{"text":"I ordered a combo rice plate. My food came out later than orders made after it. All three dishes for 
my table came out at random times with a lot of time in between each dish. 
The shrimp and rice were lukewarm to almost cool. They also served everything on a cold plate. Who does that? 
I definitely will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"There so nice and chill here. The food is always great too. It's a really clean little place too"}
{"text":"I wanted to rate this place higher.. but the broth for my pho was just a little too salty for pho. The food isn't bad, it's just completely unremarkable, and it seems like they ought to be giving you a little more meat.

The service was ok, not particularly friendly but not unpleasant either. Feels more like a takeout place than anywhere you would actually want to eat in at. 
However, as long as this is the ONLY pho place on the westside of town, I guess I'll be going back."}
{"text":"just coz its close to home, so its easy access for decent neighbor food delivery option"}
{"text":"The only reason why this rating gets 1 star is because there is NO option for NO stars. I should have just taken the drive down to Pho Saigon 8 on Spring Mtn. but my co-worker (who i'm going to strangle the next time i see him) told me that he goes here alot. Well he must like eating crap because thats what i had. The tiny bowl of non existent meat and vegetables tasted like sh**, not to mention that it also gave me the sh**s. I wont even get started on the service, which was worse then the food. So thats my yelp for this place. Take the drive to Pho Saigon 8. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Small. No pretensions. Great service, very reasonable as far
as prices go. The portions are such that you shouldn't leave hungry.
We ordered the \"bun\". Rice noodles with veggies and chicken. The flavors are so Clean
and Refreshing. Perfect for a hot day, its a dish that is supposed to be served cold, and
it was. I could easily eat this a couple times a week. I liked the two Buddhas too :D"}
{"text":"Super yummy! We will be back. We ordered beef curry and orange chicken. Highly recommend Orange chicken. It was nice and crunchy and flavorful. Good serving sizes."}
{"text":"Small mom and pop restaurant. Never really that busy, but food is decent and priced right."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(290/365) \"Spur Of The Moment\"

Unless you're in Chinatown, pickings are slim in the Northwest for Asian eats.  Pho Rose is a mom and pop shop serving both Vietnamese and Chinese food. I remember coming here in 2004 B.Y. (before Yelp) and having some tasty Bo Luc Lac (Shaking Beef).

That was 10 years ago, and I wasn't sure if ownership changed throughout the years, so we gave it a go once again.  Perusing the menu I see Bo Luc Lac, so I had my mind set on that only to be told that they don't have that and about three other items in that section of the menu...WTH? So unfortunately,  I opted for the Grilled Chicken Plate and Wifey had the Grilled Chicken and Egg Roll Vermicelli Bowl. Everything tasted pretty good and the portions here are fairly generous. 

Service was good and I guess if convenience is priority for you, then you may want to pay a visit to Pho Rose.   ALOHA!!!

Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  3"}
{"text":"Best pho and vermicelli in the summerlin and north west area . If I don't feel like driving to Chinatown I always go here. Their broth is way better than some of the other pho spots in this area ."}
{"text":"you get what you pay for, beef and broccoli was good but pho barely had any meat.
Still good for being a small place, very clean!"}
{"text":"The best ever fried rice  I ate ,pho was awesome ,the beef broccoli,spring rolls,and so close where I live , this the place I'll never change to eat at this place because I'll love the food and it's not oily and it's healthy for everybody to go eat here and that why I give them a five star"}
{"text":"Fast, great prices, good service, large portions, and the food is tasty.  Probably the best value of any of the restaurants we visit. We drink just water usually and are out the door for under 20 bucks for dinner!!!!

I get the pho nam and my wife gets the coconut curry shrimp.   The broth on the pho nam has very good flavor and the noodles absorb the flavor well.....the coconut curry is very tasty.  Family owned and operated by a nice couple. He cooks, she serves.  I like to support business's like this in a city full of corporate owned entities.  Mom and pops still have it going on and this is a great example."}
{"text":"So, I love ethnic food, and though it's not always an enormous hike to find something in the valley, I was stoked that there was a Vietnamese place up in the NW. I found myself with a hankerin' for a fresh spring roll and some grilled pork on vermicelli... so decided to try Pho Rose.  It was a smidge off of the typical lunch hour, so I wasn't shocked that I was the only person in there other than the family who seems to own it. Now, seeing a person reading the paper, or checking their email on their phone at a family owned place is not completely off-putting to me, as I have a soft spot in my heart for mom and pop joints. Thing is, they didn't exactly look up with a smile when I entered.  One of them got up, no change of expression, and put the menus on a table - then walked away. I may like the local dive, but.... you'd best smile at me.  Either way, I perused. Spring roll - check. Grilled pork and egg roll on vermicelli - check. 
Well. The spring roll LOOKED good, but upon closer inspection, it was clear that it wasn't made just then.  The shrimp was cut very thin, and the pork in it was very dry.  Hmph. Then the vermicelli came. Now, before I describe this, the price on this dish was not high. $7 and change I believe, however, I would have preferred to pay an extra dollar and get better quality. The pork, though the taste was delish, was sparse and very grisselly (is that a word?). The eggrolls were ok, but some of the meat (pork) inside appeared to be pink, which I interpreted as not fully cooked. Eeek. Uncooked pork??  I took those out. The sauce was yummy, and the veggies (cucumber and carrots) were cut larger than I'm used to in this dish.  
I'll give this place one more try another time, but at this point, it looks like I'll still be making the trek to Chinatown for my authentic Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Best pho I've found yet. Ordered chicken pho and the soup base is the best I've had. It hits the spot when we're not feeling well"}
{"text":"This is my family's go to pho place when we don't want to drive more than 15 minutes for some Vietnamese food. My old Kumon center used to be behind this place and my father waited at this place while my brother and I tried to finish our class work. The owners have become very familiar with us and knows our orders as soon as they see us. Their customer service is pretty good and their food isn't bad as everyone is complaining about. It's pretty good for something that is given to you and ready to eat within 10-15 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't look up this place on Yelp first. Since there were only three stars, I probably wouldn't have given it a chance. I was really wanting some Vietnamese soup, so I stopped by. I ordered the chicken noodle soup for $7.95 to go. When I got the bag, I thought it was odd that there was a soup container and a to go box underneath it. When I got home I saw that the soup container only had broth. All of the other ingredients were in the box. It was almost full with the chicken, vegetables, and rice noodles. They also gave me the extra jalapeños I had requested. I really liked that they had done it that way because it keeps everything from getting soggy and limp if you don't eat it all at one sitting. The broth was very garlicky which was fine with me. The soup was fresh and tasty. I'll definitely be returning in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent food from a small Mom & Pop shop. We've been coming here for years. It's nice to have a pho restaurant nearby thats not over priced. I've had nothing but wonderful service and food every time we go. 

I really enjoy establishments like Pho Rose. It's a wonderful feeling eating at a restaurant that's not owned by a corporation. We should all be supporting a hard working family that lives in our community."}
{"text":"You know it's not going to be good when...I call to see what time they close, she was rude on the phone, close at 9:30, it's 8:45... Walk in the door... Very cold stares from the lady working. She reluctantly brings us a menu and walks away... Doesn't ask for drinks or anything...menus are dirty... All tables have old food on them... She made us feel so uncomfortable we got up and left. She pretty much just pushed us out. Close earlier if you don't want to be open. I work in the industry... I get it... But you will go out of business acting like this. Zero stars if I could"}
{"text":"My family and I eat here all the time. Love the Pho. Great mom and pop place that is easy take out or eat in. If you are looking fo pho soup in Summerlin check this place out."}
{"text":"The tendon soup is so good!!! And paired with egg rolls it is amazing. I have been coming here a long time and they never fail"}
{"text":"This is a regular place for me to go. I was introduced to it years ago.... it is consistent and delicious! The lady that takes your order always knows what I want. (Coconut curry soup!) wow amazing! Can't find it this good anywhere! Also, to be honest, although the portions are bigger at the Chinese place next door... pho rose Chinese food is far superior!"}
{"text":"Favorite place for Pho. I always take it home though, I don't think the atmosphere is pleasant to sit and eat but the food is great."}
{"text":"I love pho.  This place is okay.  Very small.  Not very busy.  Not usually Vietnamese patrons.  The only thing to know is that the pho is okay and it is the only pho place in my neighborhood, so I'll probably keep going on days that I don't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown."}
{"text":"This is not the friendliest place but it's convenient ...Pho sho! Since this is the only Pho place in Summerlin it's come through for me on two occasions. 

The first occasion I had surgery to extract some of my teeth...I could barely open my mouth and my throat was sore. My mouth was numb and I sounded funny when I talked. I needed some Pho because under my current condition it was the easiest thing to eat and 9 times out of 10 it cures my sore throat. I took my Pho to go and couldn't wait to get home to eat it. I made the mistake of accidentally ordering the meat rare. I opened the raw meat while I was watching an episode of True Blood ...what timing! It was no big deal I put it in the microwave then fixed the soup. I thought it would be messy taking soup to go but they separated the veggies, the meat and the broth. Everything stayed nice and tidy. I don't eat Pho all the time so I'm not an expert but it tasted good and cured my sore throat! 

The second occasion happened this past Monday. One of my friends from San Diego was down and we were meeting up north . It was getting kind of late so she and her husband were hungry by the time we met up. Her husband was craving Pho unfortunately there isn't any Pho restaurants near Durango and the 95 that I know about so I took them to Pho Rose. It was nice to see that they also serve Chinese food there because I didn't feel like having any soup. 

We started off with the egg rolls that came with veggies like lettuce that I wrapped around the rolls before I dipped it in sweet and sour sauce. It's the first time that I wrapped my egg rolls with lettuce it tasted more refreshing that way. 

Walnut Shrimp was also ordered . In order to like this dish you have to be a fan of mayo because there is a lot of it on this dish. It was good. 

My main entree was the beef curry . It was decent but not spicy enough for me. I also felt the rice that they served with the meal looked bottom of the barrel old. It had that look of when you scrape the last of the rice out of the rice cooker . Sorry I don't like my rice crunchy. 

The food isn't horrible ..it's pretty good. If you don't want or have time to go all the way to China Town this place will do!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday. I got my order to go, but the staff were very nice while I was waiting. I haven't had pho at too many places, but this was definitely good. I ordered the pho tai (rare steak pho) and the meat was really good. Some of the pho I've had at other places had a bad flavor to it like the beef was sitting out for a few days. That definitely wasn't the case here. The vegetables were fresh, and the broth was also good. Not too oily as some others had mentioned. I'll definitely be coming back to this place. I gave 4 stars for the good-not-great egg rolls."}
{"text":"I stared miserably at my oily bowl of pho with lack of meat and flavor. Condiments of bean sprouts and mint were not fresh. I was given a measly amount of jalapenos. Sadder at the fact that this is the only place (that I know of) where you can get pho in Summerlin. Boo."}
{"text":"Hidden treasure, cannot believe it's only 3 star, the food isssss so good, best Pho in town."}
{"text":"Pho Rose is probably one of the best pho  restaurants in northwest of Las Vegas. Unfortunately there are not many options in this side of town.This is a mom and pop establishment, small but with decent food. I ordered the fried tofu and I was not very impressed with it. It was fried but very soggy on the inside. The owner is the server, she is nice but not as friendly as I would like. I usually come here for pho. Perhaps is not the best pho in town, but definitely a great option outside of china town. They also offer some Chinese plates!"}
{"text":"This is my go to pho place. It's nothing super fancy and honestly the owners aren't super talkative. That could be a language barrier thing but either way I love this place. Big bowls of hot delicious pho and great prices. It's even better to go! I always get it for hangovers or colds! I get the v7 and they drop the raw steak in the hot broth and it cooks perfectly! Squeeze some lime and throw in some green onions and it's on!"}
{"text":"I visit this restaurant for the first time with my grandmother on Wednesday. It is not busy during early afternoon. This means the Line Cook has time to cook the best meals we order. The price is quite fair comparing to other Asian restaurants. Surprisedly we got more food than we pay for! I love it. The meals look delicious. After our first bite, it is really good! The servers were very kind and respectfully quiet. Inside of the restaurant is very well-cleaned and organize. I enjoy this visit. I would recommend a \"Lunch Special\" which is $5.99 that served from 11:00am-3:00pm. You can choose any special meal on the menu. It comes with rice, cheese wonton and egg drop soup. Come visit when you can!"}
{"text":"I used postmates to order here. I am very impressed with the way my pho was arranged. I had enough soup that lasted all day. I loved the flavor and meats were cooked to perfection. I also loved all the vegetables! THANK you for great pho! I will be back and will tell all of my friends too!"}
{"text":"Pho Rose is a a restaurant specializing in both Chinese and Vietnamese food. It is located in the Albertson's-anchored shopping center at the Northeast corner of Buffalo and Vegas Drives near Summerlin Parkway. 

   This past winter when I had been commuting between Henderson and my podiatrist in northwest Las Vegas, there were a few times  I caught the Chinese food lunch special at Pho Rose. 

  On two visits I ordered the lo mein lunch special and and on a third visit I ordered pepper steak. Both specials are $5.99 before a beverage. The lunch special came with soup of the day which I expected to be egg drop soup and white rice. Both the lo mein and pepper steak were flavorful. I thought the scallions added to the flavor of the lo mein. The pepper steak was interspersed with onions and peppers that complemented the meat. My complaint is over the fact that the lunch specials only included white rice. The owner and the menu never led me to believe that there is the option of fried or brown rice with the entree. I am not a big fan of white rice. This brought down the pepper steak and lo mein. Here on my plate was half a portion of a flavorful entree and ordinary white rice. On two of my visits I drank hot tea and on the third a can of Coke. I love the train that Chinese restaurants serve and this was no exception. 

  I knew I was going to be here three times. It's near Summerlin Parkway the east-West spur freeway of US 95 that put me close to my Podiatrost's office. My intention was to order a different item each time then ultimately write the review. The dilemma is that their lunch special features around ten entrees. 

   The $5.99 lunch specials that really add up to nearly $10  with a beverage and tip is a good deal. Really it's slightly more money than McDonald's. Where the value is Pho Rose's strong point during the lunch hours, customer service is their weak point. The woman who is most likely an owner never smiled or made the effort to make me feel welcome. The customer service here severely trailed behind Diamond China 2 and China Tango Bistro ( two Chinese restaurants I recently dined in) . On my second visit, I arrived here around 11:05 a.m. The same woman stated that the soup wasn't ready because they just opened and to come back around 11:30. Fortunately there was a Starbuck's nearby in the Albertson's. The lunch menu does specify that the lunch specials are 11 to 4. Overall, the customer service was plain in similar style to the white rice. 

  The dining experience is similar to a take out style restaurant with tables. Because it was rarely busy during lunch, available tables were plentiful. Overhead pop music played. The tables and utensils were clean. 
  There is no reason for me to rush back to Pho Rose in the immediate future. When it comes to Chinese food there are better restaurants. 


Likes: Good value. Good food. Hot tea. Clean. 
Dislikes: Not friendly. Only white rice comes with the lunch special."}
{"text":"We are currently looking for a new place for pho. We like that it's so close to our house, but every time we eat here it gets worse. Customer service is bleh, the lady that takes your order isn't too friendly..You get literally one napkin while dining. We've ordered food to go a couple times and had to come back because the order was missing items. While getting the missing items she says she put it in the bag. Also I'm new to Vietnamese food, so I wasn't aware of peanuts on top of dishes. It said nothing about peanuts on the menu, when I told her I apologized said I didn't know it had peanuts..She took it to the back, came back a couple minutes later with my food..No peanuts..Most likely just rinsed it off the nuts. After that, we never went back.."}
{"text":"Are usually eat Chinese food at the restaurant next-door at least twice a week and finally decide to try pho Rose. I ordered the Szechuan chicken. It was 90% celery, the cheapest vegetable money can possibly buy. Some chicken and carrot sticks but mostly celery and sauce. Will not go back again, rather pay $2 more next door and get a better quality product."}
{"text":"Horrible service and the food wasn't that great either.. normally mediocre food is made good with excellent customers service but in this case the food was horrible and the main lady there is so rude.. If we ask her for anything it seem like we're bothering her. . Our fresh spring rolls came wrapped in hard rice paper.. my mom make spring roll all the time and the only way those get hard is if it's been sitting for a long time! The orange chicken we ordered was hard and stale.. like it was reheated then recoated with the sauce.. they were out of a lot of stuff from the menu. . And when we ask for plates for our spring rolls she said \"I was going to bring plates with your main dish\"... long story short.. waste of money.. I dont know how this restaurant is surviving with so much better noodle competitions around them!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to Pho place for several reasons.   It is super close to my house in comparison to all the other pho places in vegas.  It is never over crowded, and the service is good.  I usually order to go and it is always ready when I get there.  I get the number seven, just the simple pho with the raw meat that cooks when I throw it in the broth. The serving size is GREAT, I feel as though I almost get more when I order to go? But I'm not sure. They don't skimp on the meat, I think it is the perfect amount and there are always lots of the veggies and such in my to go box, I love it.  I do always ask for a side of sriracha, I can't eat pho without it.  Great flavor over all! And a huge serving, I'm always extremely full after and thats saying something for me.  I have sat down to eat several times and enjoyed it.  They do charge by the can for sodas which is a little annoying, but makes sense since it is a small non-chain restaurant. I can understand that. The lady at the front is very quiet service wise but I get the feeling it is just because of language differences etc, to be blunt (not because she is unfriendly or anything).  Great pho place near summerlin, definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"went to this place, food is ok - but TERRIBLE customer service!!! owner/ lady was on the phone the whole time ( while taking our order and delivering our food to our table! ). We wont be back and we'll never recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"I get take out regularly from pho rose. Not because its awesome.  Its not. Its right on the cusp of being never again and barely passable. I keep going because I love pho and its conveniently located near my work.  The soup base is decent but you have to flavor it with a lot of hoisen and sriracha. Not a big selection like other pho joints in town. Don't expect a lot of meat if you're hungry. I once ordered a grilled chicken and egg roll vermicelli bowl and got 2 small pieces of chicken. It did nothing for me. The egg rolls are barely passable. The filling is skimpy and you eat mostly fried wrapper. 
Yes I'm a repeat customer but only because its the only place to get pho in that area.  Would i recommended it? No. There's many many other places to get good pho. This is where you go when there's nowhere else to go..like that guy or girl you call when you're bored have no one else to hang out with!"}
{"text":"Small, cute place! Good food and service was great! Will be returning again soon! :)))))))"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience here! Usually we always take out but yesterday we actually sat down to eat and it was so easy and Good. I am sick so the nice hot broth makes me feel better! Also their tea was good with the coconut milk was to die for! Never had a bad experience here thanks for working so hard."}
{"text":"The broth/stock for our pho was very bland and disappointing, very skimmpy on the meat, which I can understand ALMOST about the muscle meat but they even skimped me on my offal.   I really wasn't surprised this place was practically empty of customers.  The food was very meh."}
{"text":"The food itself was decent. Better tasting than the other few pho places in the vicinity, and sadly, probably the best pho place in this area outside of Chinatown. Two of us came in during lunch time, there were only 2 other tables there the whole time. We both ordered different kinds of pho. Like I said, it was decent, nothing special. Soup was a bit too bland for my liking, but nothing a lot of hot sauce cannot fix! 

What brought the rating down was the service, or the lack thereof. The main server, probably the owner, was extremely unfriendly. Didn't say hi, didn't say anything really, and didn't even smile or acknowledge us. Though there was hardly anyone else at the restaurant, it was a task to have to get her attention to get something else or the bill."}
{"text":"Being new to \"Pho\"  I have very little to compare to.  I go there for lunch approx. twice a month and have enjoyed the big bowls of soup very much as change of pace.  It was hard to decide on what to order(waitress not very interested in offering advice)  I have tried the beef Pho (3.5 stars)  great broth(not too salty),  beef was tender, very thin.   Most recently I had the Wonton Pho.  While I enjoyed it, I would probably try something else next time."}
{"text":"Love love the pho!  Really like the husband and wife that run the place.  I definitely like to eat there about twice a week.  I need to try the rest of the menu though!"}
{"text":"Been there around 3 years ago, didn't like it, it was not good. Egg rolls were bland, broth of pho was tasteless"}
{"text":"They have very good pho. It is clean and the staff is friendly. The prices are fair and they have both Vietnamese and Chinese cuisine. On the Chinese menu I love the chicken fried rice and the beef broccoli which has a white sauce. The staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great small business tucked away in the strip mall. Decent seating amount and fairly large menu with extremely reasonable prices. Classic pho with Chinese menu items make for a good mix-match and a diverse dining group."}
{"text":"Average little place. Service was just ok. PHO was average. They didn't have mint to go with the basil and other pho toppings which I found strange. We had to ask for water refills but our order came out quickly and it was very reasonably priced. I would return just because it's close to my house and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Took beef pho to go and they were quick and super cheap and really tasty. Even order spring rolls and everything came out to $12.15! They even have seafood pho. My new pho place around the corner from my house. Beats driving all the way to Spring Mt."}
{"text":"This place has good pho and a nice selection of Chinese food.  It has inexpensive lunch specials but not stand out Chinese food.  Got to say that I enjoyed my iced Vietnamese coffee more than the food.  Convenient location with lots of parking and decent service, but place is boring and so is the food for the most part."}
{"text":"Happened upon this place while learning my new neighborhood. Ordered take out Pho the first time, then brought my friend for Pho the 2nd time. I like this place. Nothing fancy, but the food is good and the price is fair. I will return when I get a craving for Pho as its close and decent. I'll have to try some other dishes in order to review them."}
{"text":"My family and I have been dining here for well over 10 years.. the owners always greet us with a warm welcome.. we usually get the fresh coconut and soybean milk.. the vermicelli salads are delicious.. rice dishes are always savory too.. best Vietnamese flavors on the northwest part of town!"}
{"text":"Yay! I finally found a Pho place next to my work on the Northwest side of town. So far I've tried the beef and chicken pho which was tasty! The atmosphere is quiet and the business is small. The waitresses leave you alone for the most part. They only return to the table when you're ready to pay and leave (both experiences I've been there). It's not a big deal for me but I can see how some people could bad review a place simply because of that. You don't have to wait too long to get your order, The food is served rather quick which is a plus! 

Overall it's the best that I've found on that side of town considering every other pho restaurant is located in Chinatown and I would recommend to check it out!"}
{"text":"All my Yelp friends know that I have this Yelp \"Schtick\" where I try to maintain this image of a conceited, and narcissistic villain who does nothing but piss off everyone reading. Most of my reviews consist of me bragging about how unrealistically hot I am, how even my cheapest article of clothes costs thousands of dollars, how awesome my hair looks, and how your personal opinions are WRONG and my opinions are Scientific Facts. If I were a Buddhist, I would chose to be reincarnated as myself. Though it is true that I have too much money to spend and an extremely high opinion of myself, what I am practically trying to do is exactly what the \"heel character\"(aka the bad guy) does at the Pro-Wrestling shows. I talk sh!t on every onlooker until they can't stand it anymore and send me tons of death threats, insults, and angry messages. Sometimes I wonder if I have Oppositional Defiant Disorder, because I seem to get high on annoying and pissing people off.  But, I promise that this will be my last Schtick review.....maybe..

Now on to the review....

People in Las Vegas are pretty stupid, but people in NW Las Vegas are even worse. Las Vegas is like DUMB and NW Vegas is like DUMBER. So practically what we got here is a city full of Harrys and Lloyds. So, I can understand why some people would give this place a low-rating because they don't have the intelligence, class, and sophistication(Like I have) to enjoy such a fine bowl of Vietnamese Pho.

The Pho itself is extremely oily. This is natural! You really want to see oil rise to the top of soups like Pho and Tonkatsu Ramen. Why? Because that is the first visual indication that the broth is made from boiling bones for over 16+ hours.  If the soup has no oils rise to the top, it means that either the bones were not boiled long enough or they used a powder mix to make the broth.  The only times I ever see anything more greasy and oily than Natural Pho is when I have to look at the profile pictures of the Elite Yelper's faces(Of course not counting the Elites who are on my friends list, who are all like extremely hot like myself).

The Steak they use at PHO ROSE is very tender, soft, and lean. I think they might be using sirloin.  Just a note: I know that most of you NW Vegas residents live paycheck-to-paycheck. I know most you guys barely make enough money to pay the bills. I also know that you are used to eating Grade F Low Quality beef from Walmart. But, Sophisticated(like me), wealthy(like me), and Upper-Class people(like me), eat nothing but Organic Sirloin and Filet everyday. So unlike you guys, I know a good piece of steak when I see one. And, PHO ROSE has some good quality meat. 

Okay...the portions here are not as big as the places on Spring Mountain. But, the prices are a bit lower. Also, lets factor in the convenience of not having to drive 30 minutes in bad traffic to Spring Mountain and Valley View.  You know, if you have to complain about a $7.50 bowl of Pho being too expensive then you shouldn't be eating out at all. You should be saving your welfare checks to pay rent at your weekly-rate roach infested apartments.  So maybe next time, don't blow your paycheck on your gambling addiction, and don't spend so much money getting drunk and stupid at bars...... and maybe you won't have to complain about $7.00 being \"too expensive\". 

Okay... I noticed my Yelp Friend Mike C gave this place a 1-star review. I respect his review. I noticed he last ate here in 2010. I think he should give this place another try because I think they have made a lot of changes.

So, I would eat here again on account of the food, service, and convenience.  The only thing that might keep me away is the fact that this place is located near Summerlin. I don't know why, but every time I come back to Summerlin, the people just keep getting uglier!  Does a privileged and good looking guy like me really want to lower his standards and eat amongst the obese alcoholic bottom feeders of Summerlin? 

Anyway...PHO ROSE gets 5-Stars for being the best Pho in the NW."}
{"text":"The hostess/ waitress clipping her nails at the cash register should have been my first clue to turn around and find a different place to eat for dinner. But, we had just moved to Las Vegas and were hoping to find our new \"pho\" joint so we were willing to actually try the food first before we passed judgement.  Unfortunately, our first impression was correct.  It was NOT good."}
