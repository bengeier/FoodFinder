{"text":"I loved the Village Juicery. Made daily isn't so anymore. As a nutritionist and a ND I'm very well familiar with the fact that nutrients and vitamins in juice could last for up to 72 hours.  After I got my juice today I couldn't help but notice that according to VJuicery, juice can last fresh up to 96 hours which is very disappointing and deceiving for those who are not familiar with the truth.  Hopefully they will go back to their roots until then I wouldn't recommend their juice for Tropicana is a better alternative."}
{"text":"The best juice I've had in Toronto. All organic freshly cold pressed juices that make you feel great. It's crazy expensive but you're getting the best. The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable about their product.  If you're feeling extravagant and want some delicious, healthy and ethical juices you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"The first place EVER to be able to convert me to green juice. I love the \"Be Nourished\". I went from running from the room if green juice was being poured to having a glass every morning. Love it."}
{"text":"I've been a couple of times and I'm a huge fan now! I love the breakfast jars, and also can't get enough of the beet \"Be Active\" juice. The last time I popped in I also tried the Kombucha on tap which was amazing. This is quickly becoming my go-to spot for a healthy pick me up. Lovely environment as well."}
{"text":"I love Village Juicery ! The best juice store in town. Only the freshest juice, good Wi-Fi and great decor, and a garden in the back !"}
{"text":"I've wanted to juice for awhile I just didn't really understand the process or how-to without spending a fortune on a juicer and produce.  My boyfriend went and grabbed us a bunch of bottles and once you get past the initial taste they are really refreshing. We have a consultation this week with their nutritionist so we can be put on a plan. I'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"I love this little store. The juice is delicious and very fresh. Also the staff is really helpful, knowledgeable about their products and accommodating. Its a great place to start your day. Nice friendly interaction and some tasty juice."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Village Juicery!  The atmosphere is relaxing, the staff is helpful and the juices are excellent.  Cold pressed juice isn't cheap but I'd rather spend my $ on it rather than coffee or alcohol.  High recommend checking out Village!"}
{"text":"If you want to feel like you have just de-toxed yourself or that you have wiped down the inside of your body to make it squeaky clean... Come here.  Mr. H is a huge fan of this place and he is the one who introduced me to it. Every time I drink this juice, I can actually feel it cleaning up my system. It's all natural and the concoctions are nothing like I've come across before. I've probably tried almost all their varieties and the juices are named after feelings; Be Happy, Be Calm, Be Active, etc. They also have a juice made from cashews, its so yum. Its my new version of chocolate milk. They even have shots for digestion (you need to have at least three to notice a change). All juices are made fresh daily!  It's an added bonus that the people there are nutritionists and can explain the benefits clearly. The store itself is designed to look like the modern day kitchen, its very pretty.   Definitely try this place out at least once!"}
{"text":"I found this place overpriced for what you get.  The juices aren't even freshly squeezed!  They are sitting in a fridge inside the store.  I was expecting a freshly made juice instead got something I can buy at the grocery store for a quarter of the price.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this juice bar!!! The juices are always fresh and delicious!  The quality is top notch, the varieties of juice are great! The simplicity of the shops makes them perfect! They do amazing juices, hot and cold mixed beverages! My favourite thing are the happy hours!! They usually have promotions-half priced special mixed beverages.   This rating is actually a 4.5 stars.. The juices can be a bit pricey, I always tell myself your paying for quality, it adds up quick tho!  Plus I have cucumber and cashew allergies and a large selection of their juices and milks have those ingredients, it can be limiting.  Some of my favourites include:  Turmeric shots Immunity shots Be Active And the fire ball beverage  Oh and be sure to sign up for the loyalty program! It also adds up quick!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ordered the breakfast combo with an immunity shot this morning and I absolutely loved it!! Delicious and gave me so much energy. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"I originally would have given 5 stars, I love the juices, the nut milks, the power balls, kombucha, the service ... but today I was so confident in village juicery never letting me down that I decided to try one of their healthy snacks in a jar. I thought I would try the \" probiotic\" one with seasonal fruits, coconut yogurt, but milk, pumpkin seeds and hemp hearts, how could that possibly taste bad?? It was disgusting... so long story short just stick to the beverages and baked goods"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any juicery in Toronto. The place is very inviting and aesthetically pleasing. The girl working there (I do not recall her name) was extremely helpful explaining which were the most popular juices and she offered samples of the ones I was interested in before purchasing them. I purchased only two, Be Ready, which is basically lemon water with cayenne pepper, it tasted fresh and amazing, and honestly it was a safe choice since it was my first time. I also purchased Be Radiant, which is orange color, which is made from carrots, sweet potato, apple and lemon I believe. It tasted amazing and extremely fresh.   I will be coming back soon to try other juices."}
{"text":"Thank's for Tyler C. of Village Juicery for the reply. I'm know what the hydraulic press juicers are (Norwalk juicers, for example) . Especially, by being on and off  Gerson protocol for several years ;)   However my comment stands, because, even Gerson's protocol prescribe to consume the juice right away after making... Yes, they allow to refrigerate juice and consume it later ONLY as a COMPROMISE for the recovered patients, who returned to work and have no possibility to make a fresh pressed juice every hour. Even the \"Norwalk juicer\" commercials, advise to drink the juice RIGHT AWAY after it was pressed (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKIrB0wkbaM).  And oxygen... Do you press the fruits and veggies in 100% vacuum? Or it's just provides a minimum mixing of air with the juices? So, how much air is enough for nutrients to start oxidize????  What about a light exposure? Are your juices stored in the dark containers?     Anyway,  Cold-pressed juices contain many beneficial nutrients, although they can also be high in sugar and low in dietary fiber.(Rosman, Katherine \"What's Behind the Green Juice Fad?\". The Wall Street Journal)There is not enough research to determine if cold-pressed juices are healthier compared to pasteurized juices.[ Amidor, Toby  \"Cold-Pressed Juice: Is it Worth the Hype?\"][Gordinier, Jeff \"The Juice-Bar Brawl\"][ Latif, Ray \"The Juice Uprising\"] It has been suggested that eating fresh fruits and vegetables is a more balanced approach to a healthy diet than drinking the juice.( Rosman, Katherine \"What's Behind the Green Juice Fad?\". The Wall Street Journal\") Also, recommend to read:    http://www.wired.com/2015/04/nobody-can-prove-cold-pressed-juice-better/     and http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/is-cold-pressed-juice-any-more-healthy-or-is-it-all-just-hype/article24548835/"}
{"text":"Village Juice just opened up at Yorkdale Mall. This is my first time trying it but I'm excited because there are hardly an Juicery in the North York area. I work around the area so I makes it convenient for me to get my juice fix. The staff is extremely friendly and are willing to explain all the different juice they offer. Since this is my first time I've only tried the \"Be Ready\" cold pressed juice. I would probably recommend drinking this in the morning because it definitely give you that kick you in to start your day. This is probably because of the cayenne in the drink. I will for sure be coming back to try the different flavors.   Pros : Friendly staff Variety of drink flavors  Very minimalistic and modern decor   Cons: Prices are pretty high, but they are comparable to other cold pressed juices (250mL is 8.00 and 500mL is 11.00)"}
{"text":"I had to give up most solid foods for a while (for medical reasons) and I've been using UberEats to deliver me juices from here. I was dreading having to basically do a juice cleanse for a few days - I tried out the fad diet for a few days with another company a few years ago and I vowed to never do it again. But alas, now I'm forced to basically do one.  I purchased basically all the juices they offer so I have some variety in my diet, and tried their breakfast bowl (promotes digestive health, includes sunflower seeds, coconut yogurt, chia seeds) for some fibre. The breakfast bowl looked cute, but looking at all the chia seeds in it made me worry about the taste - but wow. I was shocked that it tasted good! It's definitely something I would order time and time again.  Their juices so far have all been surprisingly good. Even the scary green ones don't taste bitter - they include just enough fruits in their drinks to kick out the bitterness of the greens. I'm not sure how much carbs is in their juices though - might be a bit of a concern if you're going on a keto (low-carb) diet.  Their nut milks also taste much better than they sound. I've ordered nut milks from other locations that tasted a bit powdery for some reason, but everything was well-blended. I kind of wish they had a caffeinated option for a bit of a morning jolt, but nevertheless, they've been great so far. The prices of their juices are high, but that seems to be the going rate for cold-pressed juices in general. They may be a dollar or two higher than the average, but it's so worth that extra bit.  Thanks Village Juicery for making the past few days a bit more tolerable. I still miss solid foods, but at least I'm not getting depressed drinking nasty juices. I'll definitely be coming to visit the store myself when I'm better... hopefully by next week OTL."}
{"text":"I have never met such an informed, courteous, kind and welcoming team. My roommates and I come here almost every single day. It's become a necessity in our daily diet. The drink suggestions of the staff are definitely informative and extremely helpful in guiding our drink choices to meet our individual daily nutrient requirements. The drink selection is perfect and well balanced with a variety of salads or baked goods."}
{"text":"I had the flu a couple weeks ago and could barely move from my bed, let alone find something with nutrients. I went on UberEats and after narrowing down my options, ordered from Village. I got an immunity shot, the Be Active, and Hydrate and Heal. I'm not entirely sure they helped me get over the flu, but they were delicious juices. If you like beets, you'll really like the Be Active juice. Prices were very reasonable considering the quality and portion size. I like that they have glass bottles you can reuse for water, etc. Looking forward to ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Belle petite boutique, des produits locaux (chocolats, Kale chips etc.) sont offerts en plus des délicieux jus. J'aime le concept, j'ai pu déguster certain jus avant d'acheter ce qui est très apprécié. Le staff était très gentil et j'aime beaucoup leur lait de cashews. J'ai aussi pris un \"shot\" au gingembre... ça arrache autant que la téquila mais on adore ! Leur sélection de jus pourrait être aggrandi mais on aime ce qu'ils offrent pour l'instant!"}
{"text":"Was acknowledged by the staff. She came and asked if I needed any help or have any questions. I asked what she would recommend for cleansing. She mentioned \"be clean\" was one of the popular ones, which was what my eyes were set on at the very beginning. I enjoyed it, it only has 10% sweetness from the apple.  Drinking this makes me want to invest in a juicer now."}
{"text":"Another juicery to give Greenhouse Juice some competition at Yonge and Eglinton! I've visited their other location on College. This one is similar with a tiny seating area. The design is bright, airy and welcoming. Both times I've visited, Cara, has been knowledgeable and sweet. They have a wide variety of juices, as well as hot drinks like kombucha. They also stock some snacks, beauty products, and books on healthy living. I'm a sucker for the beautiful designs on the glass bottles of their seasonal juices. I'm not sure if cold-pressed juices are worth the $$$, so this is more of an occasional treat for me, rather than place I would go frequently. They do have a bottle return program -- you get 25 cents back on small bottles and 50 cents back on large ones. If you are unsure of which drink to choose, you can ask for a sample."}
{"text":"I have been to all the juicers in Toronto and Village Juicery is by far the best. We get our weekly orange, grapefruit and apple juice here. It's hard to find a REAL single-fruit juice. I tried an orange juice from their competition and I could taste a bit of carrot in the orange juice."}
{"text":"Amazing service !  They will allow you to sample a few friendly flavours before purchasing the one you like best!  Loved the vibe and atmosphere from this Juicery Though the location is petite in size, the staff definitely make a statement in making you feel welcome upon walking in !  One of my favourite Juiceries in Toronto for sure!  Be sure to try their probiotic jar with Cashew Yogurt, the ginger shots are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Best juice spot in town!  Besides being super lovely, all of the workers are certified nutritionists, so they know what they're talking about.   Nice, relaxed vibes, and with a bar overlooking the streets so you can watch the world go by as you sip.  Also, they have a customer rewards system, so if you bring back your glass bottles you can build yourself some credit.   A few tasty salad bowls to pick from (two) and LOTS of yummy, healthy vegan snacks. Definitely my happy place."}
{"text":"Tried their one day cleanse and it was amazing. I love the variety of content and the relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. Yum"}
{"text":"The cold pressed orange juice is possibly the best $4.50 I've ever spent ... Just what I needed on a sunny afternoon!   Honestly this place is SO cute. The decor, great selection of juices and healthy snacks, paired with amazing customer service makes me happy I live so close to this place!   I love how environmentally it is as well! All the juices are in glass bottles and they have a recycling program in place (when you bring your bottles back you get money toward more juices!)   Can't wait to visit again! :)"}
{"text":"Call me impressed but I didnt think I would love a chai latte made with no actual tea in it but here we are!  Village juicery converted me.  The spot on Roncy is really zen... we walked in and they had music that matches the atmosphere.  Modern and serene but with a bit of an edge with it's metallic sheen on the bar and sharper angles on the decor.  I really liked it.  It has a nice little alcove in the back where you can sit and enjoy a drink or nibble.  It's very clean ... feels almost spotless with everything all well organized.   They mainly focus on offering cold press juice which you can see in the large refrigerated cases along the back wall.  They have a few salads and snacks on offer but I feel it's more of a take out spot for its drinks.  They also have kombocha on \"tap\" as well.  Chai latte - have to admit, this was delicious.  Strongly spiced in a good way, you can taste the cinnamon, cocoa, cloves, and cardamom.  It pleasantly fuses with the sweet coconut milk and medjool dates.  All the sweetness comes from those two and that's it.  No additional sugars.  It looks like it get its richness from pistachios and cashews as well.  They serve it hot and it was perfect for a cooler Sunday morning.  I honestly think it's one of the better spiced drinks I've had in the city 5/5.  Coconut Matcha Superfood Bite -  cute little snack sized bites to give you a bit of energy.  This one was very good in bright flavours.  You could taste the matcha, coconut, honey, vanilla, and nut pieces.  I could taste a bit of the cashews but it's quite mild.  The little snack ball was chewy like a coconut bar.  I really thought this one was a nice snack.  4/5  Toasted Sesame Superfood Bite -  an interesting take on their healthy snacks but to me, the flavours weren't melding as good as the coconut matcha.  It had a more herbal or earthy flavour I wasn't expecting.  This sesame flavour was very prominent but the earthy and herbal note was a strong following after the first bite.  It mentioned that it's also has medjool dates and maple syrup but i didn't taste them that strongly.  I just looked up the ingredients when I noticed Chaga tea.  That's mushrooms.  That explained the earthy flavour.  3.5/5  I love the chai latte and the matcha coconut bites.  They definitely has some great flavours here and love to try more."}
{"text":"This is the first cold pressed juice place that i've tried.  First time having it was from the Holts Cafe (they charge $15 for one... if you go to the Juicery they charge $11).  The nutritionist on site was very helpful and provided information on each juice that they had on site.  Nourish was the drink i chose as it was 50% fruit and 50% green.  It was a good starter juice to drink compared to the lemon one i tried."}
