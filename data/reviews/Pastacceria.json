The only thing in that dish capable of making me that ill, would be the sausage.
BEWARE of food establishments that are in such a hurry to prepare and serve your meal, that they take shortcuts with food handling safety."}
{"text":"My second time ordering pasta and this confirms it...bland. Today I ordered fettucini carbonara and it was very bland and the egg turned scrambled, $9 down the drain. I also witnessed multiple food safety violations. The cashier served 2 ladies in front of me and made them paninis with no gloves on and answered the phone and handled money without washing her hands, ew! The cook also touched things then went back to cooking without washing his hands. Safe to say I will not go back."}

Not anything you can't make from home 

Service was on the bad side 

Presentation was lacking"}
