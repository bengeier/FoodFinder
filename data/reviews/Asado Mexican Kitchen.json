{"text":"Very good! Visited twice and will be back... attentive waitstaff, great food, and the chips and salsa were good and fresh."}
{"text":"Nice environment but not much Mexican influence.  Food was bland.  Sent out my son's pollo fundido and the burrito was burnt on one side and the bland sauce just covered over it.  We had 6 people with us and nobody was impressed.  Too bad because we were hoping for a good new place.  Also a little pricey for the food served. Check the menu before you go because it is not traditional Mexican choices."}
{"text":"Had lunch there,slow biz day,good thing ,ive been paying the price ever since.Service was good but food was relatively flavorless.mostly heat. My wifes tacos were soggy and dripped juice(water). The silverware was spotty.quite honestly rubios has better tacos.Sorry to say...this area needs a quality Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not the authentic Mexican food our family is accustomed to. Salsa and cheese crisp was good"}
{"text":"Great food!  Wife had the taco salad with green chili chicken.  It was very flavorful.  I had the carnitas tacos which had a ton of pork.  Yum. We will be back."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish tacos to go. It was uneatable. The person who took my order was very nice. I really wanted to like this place- but I just can't. It was awful. Truly awful. The fish smelled and was over cooked. Rubbery and nasty."}
{"text":"Hubby and I checked out Asado for brunch on Sunday afternoon.  Weather was perfect to enjoy their comfy patio seating and wait staff was excellent.  What's not to love about $5 create your own bloody marys and GRANDE mimosas???  Thankfully the food itself was great too and extremely reasonable. I had the carne asado omelet with the green chili biscuit on the side (the biscuit itself is worth going back for, nothing less than amazing).  Hubby had habanero benedict which he raved over.  Both were $9.  I was expecting very small portions or sub-par food for the prices, but didn't get either and was very pleasantely surprised.  The restaurant is spacious with a decent size bar with lots of tvs for watching sports.  Very excited to finally have some good food up in the Tatum/Dynamite area.  Long overdue!  And definitely looking forward to bringing some friends to Asado for brunch next time."}
{"text":"From the other reviews, we were expecting poor service and average food. We were delighted that everything was above average. The owner/manager was friendly and professional. The place looks fantastic -- they've obviously put a lot of money into the remodel, from the patio to interior seating. The bar looked great from a distance. Our server was great. And the food was very good, and certainly not the old school mexican food from the past. The pulled pork special was huge! Like a big BBQ, and plenty of quality*quantity for the price. We also got a wet burrito, which was great, altho maybe a little underseasoned. So no complaints... we can think of only 1-2 mexican restaurants in N Scottsdale that are better."}
{"text":"Last night a friend and I went into Asados and sat for 10 minutes as the bartender saw us sitting at a high top table waiting to be approached, and finally the manager asked us if we have been helped. Basically I won't bore you anymore we were there a total of 39 minutes and never got anything but chips and salsa and empty drinks. She never planned on coming back I guess we just were not of importance when as little as she knows we are both I. The business and gave her way mor time than she deserved. We will never ever be back and what they are related to the owners of Mastros? Wow horrible"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so bad that I felt compelled to create an account just to post this review! My wife had the house salad as an appetizer and much of the mixed greens was starting to rot. On top of that the balsamic dressing had the same consistency of butter.  The guacamole tastes like its out of a plastic bag....definitely not fresh. The chicken and steak tastes like rubber, straight out of the cheap Cisco truck and onto my plate  This has to be the worst Mexican food in all of the Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Enjoyed great happy hour and appetizer specials last night. Carne asada tacos were fantastic! Great place to watch sports. Service was excellent. I'll look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"For years we have been waiting for a  Mexican food restaurant and now, not to be nasty, still waiting.  The soft tacos were uninspiring.  Flour tortilla, might as well have used dinty moore meat.  Bland, a few shreds of lettuce and  a few dicings of tomatoes.  Cheese crisp, so-so but the worst part.  The margaritas were so bad we couldn't drink it.  We told the server about them, did she offer to take it off the check, NO!!  The service was okay but the food, not so.  Maybe we're expecting more.  My suggestion is to go to Carlos O'Briens, Maycayo's, or Luna for cues on how things should be done.  Don't think I'll be back until I have given enough time for the menu items to improve.  We want you to succeed but that just isn't the case at this time!!~"}
{"text":"First time here and loved the food and top notch service! Wish we could have stayed for the live music! Will definitely go again and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fully one of the best authentic Central American restaurants I have enjoyed. Coming back very soon"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now, I'm a creature of habit and each time got the salmon and grilled veggies. Delish!!!! May be strange to get salmon at a Mexican restaurants but it was awesome. Love the new decor, and they're working their kinks out with new wait staff. I'm really surprised at the number of negative reviews, as I've had nothing but great experiences and good food here. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Not as good as when they finished remodeling. We loved it back in January/February and went there several times.  Beautiful décor.  Dined there Saturday night and ordered the Mexican pizza and chicken burrito. These are the same items we ordered several times before.  We were very disappointed with this visit.   The chicken burrito hardly had any chicken in it and the Mexican pizza was overcooked.   Burrito was not acceptable but were in a hurry so didn't send it back.  Doubt we will be back to this restaurant.  No excuse for scant amount of meat in burritos.  There are other better choices in the area."}
{"text":"It's really really sad... here we sit... tonight my family and I wanted Mexican... and figured we would try out the new joint in the hood... mistake... let's start with me... The black bean burger... GREAT flavor... however... it fell apart... when I took the bun off to place the burger back on , the bun... I realized it was stale!!!! Annnnnnd there was a quarter size squirt of chipotle mayo... sad...so sad... when I told the server...  \"sorry about that\"... she was sweet for sure... she just didn't have that \"let me take care of you attitude\"... listen... im a server myself... I would bend over backwards for a guest... my daughter had street tacos... ummmm don't waste your time... my husband had the green chili burrito.... veeeeeery disappointing... how can you get this stuff wrong?  This is all basic Mexican recipes... stale chips overly salted... my fries?  I'm almost sure they are frozen...  and the cherry on top... my husband is of the by gone era of \"finish everything in your plate\"... hes still eating, I refuse to eat crap and obviously my children are following suit... and the server asks (after my drink has been empty almost the whole meal) do we want refills... I say \"no, we are all finished\" and she replies \"okay, shall I bring you the check?\" ... young lady, my husband is still downing food... check? Jimney cricketts!!! She is definitely not trained properly... ummm honestly... I screw up as a server from time to time... I also try to make it right... this one... didn't get it... I'm sorry if she reads this... but more training is needed... oh on top of that... KNOW YOUR MENU!!! 56$  meal and we will NEVER go back!!!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant, and heard about it from the groupon deal. As a recent transplant to AZ, most mexican restaurant food is always amazing compared to the east coast. However, this restaurant fell short of our expectations of good Mexican food.  My husband ordered the highly recommended Pollo Fundido. The chicken was extremely chewy and the cheese looked like a processed slice of cheese was melted on top of it. I ordered the vege and chicken tacos which were good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The margaritas were very sweet and barely had any alcohol, they were definitely overpriced. I've never left a restaurant without finishing a drink, and tonight I barely drank 1/4 of it. Waste of money if you ask me.  I wouldn't recommend this place. The atmosphere is great and it has so much potential, but the food is terrible. Service was just okay."}
{"text":"Went there a few days ago hoping for good food. Well they missed the mark. Server said  Mexican pizza was great and it was not. We told her that, them tells us her mom said the same thing. Why did you recommend? Chimis were pretty good. Waitress was clueless, did not even try to up sell us at all. Not that we would have bought anything.   Other Mexican places in area are better."}
{"text":"Asado is a great hangout!  Good food and drinks.  The menu is full of very tasty choices. I like the feel of a Mexican Hacienda meets High Tech.  Cool place with good food!  I live in the area and felt like I was at my own Casa! Only thing missing was my pool!"}
{"text":"This is the second time my husband and I have been here. The first, we sat in the dining room, and had a wonderful server. I think her name was Sonni...she had great service, we were even one of the last people to leave at the end of the night, and we still got great service! We sat at the bar this time, and service was still great. Got acknowledged within moments of us sitting down, and got drinks really quickly since it was close to happy hour ending   Food has been consistently great, I had the chicken and steak fajitas the first time, my husband the fish tacos. The presentation was good, not great, but who cares about that as long as the food is good?! Things were cooked perfectly, and it all tasted very good. This time we had the chivche.....good, not great. We added a little more lime juice and that helped. The flavor was a little bland, but not bad overall. Although, it was really hard to get the chivche out of the margarita glass it was served in, so I suggest that change. Otherwise, everything was great tonight.   We will be back, and definitely bringing friends next time!"}
{"text":"This place is so close to home that I really want to like it but there are just too many reasons not to.  As another Yelper stated the decor is nice post remodel and that is as good as it gets here.  Chips and salsa were brought to the table quickly and when my wife requested HOT salsa it was brought out quickly as well.  Placed our order..... carne asada burrito for me, fish tacos for my wife. They must be rationing fish in the kitchen.  Two tiny pieces in each taco which didn't fill the corn tortilla end to end. No flavor and not hot.  The carne asada burrito was small and the tortilla was like a firm paste. The quantity of tortilla outweighed the amount of carne asada. The beans were almost warm which puzzled me because the plate was very hot.  My wife asked for additional chips which never arrived to our table.  We were never asked if we enjoyed our meal. Im guessing that the amount we left on our plates spoke for us.  5:30 on a Saturday night and the place is at 30 - 40% occupancy. I am pretty sure I know why.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great service. Tasty and spicy hot sauce. The chili rellano was excellent. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time tonight. We went for \"Taco Tuesday\" ($2). We were very pleasantly surprised. They have recently changed management in the past two months. The staff was very courteous and friendly. Our server, Austin, was fantastic.   I ordered four different flavors. My top two favorites were the roasted green chili and the flash-fried chicken with sweet chili sauce. I would definitely get them next time I go.  The chips were fresh and so was the salsa. That is a must for me when going to a Mexican restaurant.   The place itself is cozy and I like the decor. I would recommend you try it out. It was a great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Asado is my new favorite Mexican Restaurant and is within walking distance from my home!  I certainly enjoy hot food and they've not let me down from that aspect. It's not often that I use sour cream to cool off a bit, but I'm glad it's included with the Pork Adovada. I also highly recommend the Green Chili Burrito and am pleased they offer it Green, Red, and Christmas style.   One caution I have is the chips and salsa. They are addictive... You will request more... Then the food will arrive and your foolish man pride will tell you to finish that second batch of chips you couldn't do without. You'll then be challenged to eat even half of your entree before your spouse takes away your plate send says you've had enough! I speak from experience, it's happened to me three times now."}
{"text":"Asado is absolutely a five-star worthy restaurant relative to other Cave Creek restaurants, and is a great addition to this area of town. To sum it up - fantastic service, a very nice ambiance/interior, great portions, great food, and inexpensive prices. The only downside to the meal were the cocktails, which were all too sweet, but that's easily fixed by sticking to beer or soft drinks in the future. I loved the complimentary table salsa, which was perfectly balanced, fresh, with just a hit of heat.  I don't remember the name of our waitress, but she was fantastic. After learning I was vegetarian, she took the time to check with the kitchen to find out what really was vegetarian and not. Turns out items that would be easy to think are vegetarian are not, and she was happy to help with suggesting other options that would work for me. For other vegetarians the green sauce, red sauce, and rice are not vegetarian. We had:  - Bean & Cheese Chimichanga with Fundido Sauce: Yummo and so much food (two meals)! The fundido sauce was the vegetarian sub instead of red/green sauce, and it was really good. Pretty hard to not like cheese sauce. I added the fresh table salsa to brighten and lighten it up. I would happily order this again. - Guacamole: This was fine. I probably wouldn't order it again because the complimentary salsa was so good, but it was fine guacamole. - Green Chili Burrito: My husband had this and though it was really good. He loved the stew-like filling. - Strawberry Margarita: Typical frozen machine margarita with way too much sugar. Definitely not worth getting again. - Sangria: Also too sweet and not very refreshing. Besides an orange wedge and maraschino cherry, it was a wine cooler. - Elderflower Mule: Though the flavors were interesting and good (sort of tasted like a spa treatment), it was too too sweet. - Chopped Salad: Refreshing and satisfying as a lighter meal option. Great dressing, and lots of cheese and avocado as salad toppers.  I definitely will be back to Asado, whether for eating in or picking up take out. I'm really glad such a good offering with reasonable prices has come to Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Save your self !!! Had the chili verde which had zero taste, green sauce tasted like it was from a can. My wife and ordered margaritas that was liked a drink that sat for two hours.  Service is totally clueless!!! Doesn't even know there menu. It's the same cheap owner who owned the restaurant prior and it shows!!! Left and went to a real restaurant never will we step foot there again. The manager has no idea on customer service,  The lettuce wraps had old lettuce, brown, piss poor. It may be the only restaurant in the area but be real it is run like a high school cafeteria . Zero stars Never going back!!!"}
{"text":"I brought my mother here a few days before Mother's Day for dinner.  The food was horrible.  I had a combo which was a beef taco, an a cheese enchilada and they said it was a tostado... but it was the size of a 50-cent piece.  I love Mexican food and there are so many kinds. I've experienced the vey high end expensive (where we go out with work and it's on the company dime), do your local hole in the wall Mexican joint where the entire staff is Mexican.  I've found great restaurants along the entire spectrum.  However, this place is just god awful.  From what I gather, there are new owners with little to no restaurant experience.  There clearly is no one in the kitchen who is responsible for coming up with the menu, or if there is... they need to fire him/her immediately.    The taco - the basics of Mexican.  Mine so literally dripping of grease, and since it was a combo it just came on its side, bathing in the grease it was cooked it.  I picked it up and squeezed it and it just popped grease out it's back end for quite a while.  And the beef...did it even have beef, what was that crap?  The cheese enchilada.  Again, one of the most simple things to make, however I don't know what they use for their enchilada sauce but after one bite I thought I was going to throw up.  I'm not making this up folks.  That enchilada sauce has something in it, some ingredient, that needs to be removed.    And the tostada... my God, it couldn't be any smaller.  Seriously, take one of the chips they give you when you sit down and it's smaller than that.  Why bother even having it in the combo if it's going to be so small that you can shove the whole thing in your mouth in one bite.    Staff - great waiter.    Saw who I presume to be one of the owners running around like a chicken with his head cut off.  Sloppily dressed, shirt hanging out over his gut.  All of the staff had uniforms, at least an Asado t-shirt, so I'm pretty sure this was the owner, or one of them; not exactly the image you want to portray when you are the owner.    What is sad is that this place has potential.  Great location, interior decorations are great, it looks like they have a nice patio being built, but... and this is a big BUTT - these folks clearly do not know how to run a restaurant and I am just guessing that they have zero experience in the restaurant business.  Just get a few hundred thousand dollars, spiff up the place, and the customers and the money will start rolling in.  It doesn't work that way!  If you want to stay in business I strongly suggest: 1 - fire whoever is in charge of the menu and the cooking.  You need FRESH food, non-greasy, and you need to knock out the basics.  If you can't even get a taco, tostado, or a cheese enchilada right, then you are in serious trouble.   Did I say FIRE the chef? 2 - Be more professional.  If you are the owner and you look like a slob - DON'T interact with the customers! 3 - Bring someone in who knows how to change up your menu, look at your value proposition/vision (which you clearly don't at this point) and change things around before its too late. 4 - I had a good waiter, but I was watching the rest and watching cute young girls with long hair running their fingers through their hair is just disgusting. Go in any successful restaurant and you will see that they don't let girls continually play with their hair.  They tie it back AWAY from the food. 5- Figure out if you want to be a dive, a sports bar, a fine dining restaurant, etc.  You guys are all over the place. 6 -Did I mention you need a serious change up in the kitchen?  Seriously, your food is just awful.    Are you reading these reviews?  Are you just ignoring the bad ones and loving the good ones?  Well, put these reviews in date order and you'll see that you have a big problem on your hands.  I imagine the bills are starting to add up pretty quickly as you sure don't seem very busy.    My advice to people - go try it out soon because it's going to be gone in the blink of an eye."}
{"text":"This place has possibly the worst waitstaff I've encountered. I took my son for his 10th birthday. The waitress literally stood 20 feet away talking to her friends and ignored us until I got up and walked up to her. If you have a can of Rosarita refried beans and a jar of Pace you're already well ahead on quality."}
{"text":"When they first opened the food and service were amazing, very fresh and original menu items. The next 2 times, its seems the staff has change all has gone down hill, too bad."}
{"text":"This is the 4th time I've eaten at Asado. Tonight we got to go and tried something different. We got the spin dip for an app... AMAZING. I love this stuff!!!!  For the main course I got the carnitas burrito. I'm pretty picky about carnitas and this was melt in your mouth delicious. Rice and black beans were great as well. The cotija cheese on the black beans is a great touch. My husband got the grilled chicken tacos, which he said were excellent. The grilled pepper and onions made it for him. The best meal I've had at Asado was definitely the Chile lime roasted chicken. The chicken itself was tender & juicy. The chipotle mashed are always fantastic and the grilled vegetables add that extra touch of awesome. Oh, and you have to try the nutella empanadas... They are freaking incredible. Every time I've been to Asado the service has really been exceptional. And you can't beat the tamarindo margarita!!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating at Asado and we absolutely loved it. We eat at a lot of authentic Mexican restaurants and this was on par with the best ones. I had the enchilada stack and I absolutely loved the sauce. I couldn't get enough of it. I wished my leftovers could last for days! The portion size was huge. My husband had a chimichanga and noted that this was the first time he actually received one that was crispy, since at other Mexican restaurants, the tortilla is usually soggy from the grease. we had the hot salsa with our chips and we also loved that, despite the fact that I am picky when it comes to authentic salsa. The chips were crisp and light, just perfect to go with the chips. We wanted to eat at Asado again a few days later, but figured we should at least wait until the weekend so we don't eat up eating the food at Asado every day."}
{"text":"Still coming and still loving it. They went under new ownership recently which is why they were under construction for a while but it was worth it.   Prickly pear margarita for the win followed by spinach con queso for an appetizer (FAVORITE).   I usually just get cheese enchiladas and my boyfriend always switches it up with tacos, quesadilla, etc.   You should really try this place out. Bernie the manager is great and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Service is bad. Food is not good. Not authentic. It's a little concerning that it has had multiple openings. I would not waste my time or money here."}
{"text":"We have been here approx. 10 times because it is close to home.  It has progressively gotten more disappointing and honestly, I would not give it a star if it wasn't for our nice waiter. The food Has been awful the past three times we have tried. I ordered a simple carne asada burrito. I just came with red sauce on top.  No accompaniments ie: lettuce, tomato, guacamole, cheese, sour cream, etc... Not to mention it was missing the steak inside... My husband's Enchilada looking like a deflated hot dog, not large enough for a child to fill up on. Very disappointed!!!!!! I would skip this place solely on the food alone.  It is a better place to partake on a beverage after work and call it a day.  Lastly, the owner has done a great job with ambiance, but has missed the boat on how to draw a local crowd in the place,"}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Went opening week and it was pretty bad. Chalked that up to getting the kinks worked out. Returned after 6 months and it is worse. Friday night the place is empty and I now know why."}
{"text":"Not a huge surprise that this restaurant has (mercifully, as another reviewer pointed out) closed. It was a train wreck from Day 1. But blaming Tatum Ranch for its failure? Yikes. As a business owner who struggled and survived (barely) the Great Recession, there is only one place to look when a business goes under - at its leadership. It's not your landlord when you can't pay the rent, it's not the crappy customers who don't know good service when they see it, and it's not economy (usually).   A successful business needs strong leadership, a unwavering commitment to customer service, and a competitive product. Asado seems to have had none of these.   I will repeat again (maybe someone is listening who is hoping to open a restaurant up in these parts?) what we need in Tatum Ranch and why:  There is MAD CRAZY NEW construction up here! Big new custom homes, huge new developments means customers with cash. Aside from Brisam's (pretty good and always packed, but I can't go there every day!) and Babbo, we have a 10+ minute drive to any other decent restaurants.   WE NEED a chef-driven, independent type of restaurant that is contemporary American-style, transitional food. Not Italian, not Chinese, not pizza, and PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, no Mexican. Good cocktails, great wine list, family-friendly, nice appetizers, a great bar, good prices, HAPPY HOUR MENU, and continue the outdoor patio! Think Rusconi's, Fox Restaurant concept stuff (Culinary Dropout, etc.) as far as food goes.   This place used to be a hopping happenin' place when it was the old Cocomo Joes! Granted, the food sucked and the service left something to be desired... but people FLOCKED to that place on the weekends w/ the bands that played. They had a competitive product - the best cougar bar in Maricopa County ;)   It's a great location and a restaurant is even more desperately needed now that Amaro has also closed next door."}
{"text":"The interior of this restaurant is beautiful! One of the coolest Mexican Restaurants I've been in. The bar is just as cool with nice TVs to watch games.  The menu has a great selection of food. I've eaten here 3 times now. The burritos are great including the Breakfast Burrito at the Sunday Brunch.  Great food and Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. I figured since the last time it was decent food I would go again.  I ordered the mini chimis for an appetizer and it was the saddest plate I have ever seen. I have attached a picture of the chimis.  We got the enchiladas with red sauce and it was the most foul tasting red sauce.  The sauce was over salty and had a strange taste to it.  The rice was also terrible. The only redeeming quality of this place is the salsa and the friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"The old Cocomo Joes, I used to go there for HH, truthfully depressing atmosphere and lacking service. Perhaps due to the regulars anyone not a regular doesn't get any attention.  They have potential but sadly I don't have high hopes."}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is the decor. We had to ask for chips and salsa---a no brainer at a Mexican restaurant. I ordered the fajitas -- another no brainer. No guac, no sour cream, barely any rice or beans. The service was OK. I wouldn't recommend it. Go to Fajitas for fajitas, or Teepee for old-school Mexican fare."}
{"text":"To all neighbors in the Cave Creek area, beware this is without a doubt some of the worst Mexican food in the state of Arizona. Take a look at other reviews, I can tell you that the guacamole is nowhere near fresh this is straight out of a cryovac bag. The quality of the salsa is straight out of a number 10 can, not fresh what so ever. The chips are served cold. The red sauce as well as Christmas sauce very disappointing a lot of heat and no flavor. The service is mediocre at best, our server had absolutely no education on the menu. When I ask the server, what's popular here he replied by saying are tacos sell really well.... with that being said, that's a red flag if the tacos are the most popular item on the menu.  The same owner runs and operates this new facelift removing the Cocomo Joe's banner but still putting out the same crappy low quality food that is probably purchase from Restaurant Depot or a broad line distributor and all the cook in the back continues to be worried about is how cheep is the meat today, what's the best price you can get me on cheese, etc. and in no way spending a few extra pennies for quality ingredients to make the community happy and pleased with this new facelift.  A message to the owner, you did a facelift to your location giving the impression that something new exciting and high quality was coming to our town, very disappointing. You still have maybe have one more chance to redeem yourself, hire a real chef and  hospitality manager and get your s*** together so that people will continue to come back and enjoy themselves. If you do not take a drastic course of action which may already be too late your business will fail.  If you would have just simply change the menu at COCOMO, added more entertainment cleaned up your act there you would have saved probably hundreds of thousands of dollars on your face lift and gotten a better  response from our community."}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised by some of the reviews.  New menu, perhaps new staff - give them the benefit of the doubt and some time to work out the bugs.  Our experience last week was great.  Very good attentive service, food - not \"fantastic\" but solid.  All of us at the table were pleased and we'll go back.  Cave Creek yearns for some dining options.  Support your local businesses!"}
{"text":"First time coming here after finding a groupon. Food was great and very reasonable. Our waiter wasn't very on top of things. Our drinks were empty more than they were full. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. But you can't eat Mexican every week. It's now closed, not surprised. Hope it reopens as a sports bar with a varied menu."}
{"text":"First, this restaurant is in a fabulous location and the decor is amazing. I wish the service was as good as the food though. My partner and I were basically ignored while checking in. People that came in after us were treated better and seated before us which was irritating. They had more hostesses and bussers than they did waiters and cooks. Our waitress was super cool and very accommodating so +++ for her. Food was good, but they need some better management and more staff."}
{"text":"Too bad this place wasn't closer to my house. Amazing place, food was appealing and met my dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"Gave you two chances Asado. You let me down twice. Taco Bell is a better choice.  Same taste and cheaper.  Don't wish you malice, but you're in deep trouble if you don't step up your game. There's many mediocre Mexican joints here in town, stop being one of them."}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times now and I'm sad to say it's never gotten any better.  The worst part is that there's not a lot of options to go eat in this neighborhood.  If you're in the mood for Mexican food I'd suggest you take a drive and find somewhere else."}
{"text":"Rather unremarkable Mexican food, chicken in the street tacos days roasted, was clumped bland unseasoned processed like you might find in a can at Costco."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night at 6 (we made a reservation). Loved the fresh hot chips and house made salsa, the mild is perfect and the hot has a kick! I had the chimi and hubby had the burrito, and Cadillac margaritas. The food was delicious, great service, clean and nice decor. Also happy to note that the rice and beans were also flavorful (they tend to be overlooked at restaurants in this area). The manager said hello, and we will be back. Can't wait to check out the fajita bar and sit outside when it cools off. Try it, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Major upgrade from Cocomo's.  The ambiance is much nicer, cannot wait until they put in their new FAJITA BAR (going to look like hibachi).  Wife ordered the chicken burrito and we shared that and the Mexican pizza.  Nothing special about the burrito but it was large,  Mexican pizza was pretty good, if you like spicy get their hot salsa.  Our friends got the shrimp ceviche and said it was awesome!  All in all will go back!"}
{"text":"Was disappointed when the owner closed Cocomo's and decided to go Mexican. I use to love getting the street tacos and Pittsburg wings during happy hour and maybe watching some sports at Cocomo's. Came to Asado specifically for the wings since they were always outstanding at Cocomo's, so I can't speak on the Mexican food part, although, the chips with the chips & salsa looked like somebody had stomped on them earlier as they were broken into tiny pieces. As for the wings, instead of 8 wings you now get 6 which are overpriced at more than a dollar a wing unless you do Happy Hour. No longer served in the kinda cool little bucket, they were wet and caked with spice, not crispy and lightly spiced like they use to be at Cocomo's. They weren't served with the good Wasabi sauce like they use to be so we had to ask for some. The waitress then brought out some sauce that was so watered down you could barely taste any Wasabi, looked like green water. Needless to say I was very disappointed that they would take one of their most popular items from Cocomo's and then proceed to ruin it. Not giving up on Asado yet, but the owner needs to address some of these issues mentioned in these reviews soon."}
{"text":"Great Food...Great Service  Once again I am reminded why I stay away from Yelp.   Completely irresponsible reviews by complete idiots.  This food is delicious and the service was unbeatable.   We had stacked enchiladas and the chicken tacos.     With tools like Brandon K, Terry S and Liz D lecturing restauranteurs on how to execute their business its not hard to see why Yelp is dying the slow death that Angies List is.   GREAT FOOD......oh and head over to TripAdvisor.com to avoid the Yelp assassination squads."}
{"text":"Was hoping this place would shine.  Having frequented the former tenant Cocomo Joe's, I knew the size of the establishment and potential was there.  The makeover is impressive...the food and service...no so.  The \"hot\" salsa and regular salsa tasted exactly the same temp wise.  The ingredients were blasted in a food processor and the consistency was more like watery paste than a chunky, tasty salsa.  Missing were onions, cilantro and other, normal robust flavors typical of restaurant salsa, very unimpressive.  Our dinner choices consisted of the Pollo Fundido and the Spicy Chicken Tacos.  The pollo fundido, while it had nice chunks of chicken, it tasted more like a fajita with pieces of green and red peppers inside.  The fried tortilla was limp and even soggy in some places - gross!  Very dry inside, no cheese.  The spicy cream cheese is like fondue in that it is poured over the outside of the wrapped tortilla and it just sits there in a thin, unflavorful layer.  A better choice is to add flavorful cheese combined with a smooth, creamy, spicy cream cheese mixture.  This place obviously believes in pulverizing all of the food components beyond recognition so you truly don't know what is (or isn't in most cases) added for ingredients (refer back to my salsa comments above).  The spicy chicken taco was laughable.  It was like they ran to Panda Express and picked up orange chicken and put it in a taco.  It was truly orange chicken advertised as a \"spicy taco\".  There was nothing Mexican/authentic about the ingredients of this dish and how they serve this as a Mexican dish or as spicy is beyond one's imagination.  We all were laughing about the contents of this dish.  As for the service...our waitress seemed very unsure of herself, was mumbling every time she came to our table.  The place was not even 1/4 full and it was ghost-town like.    One thing I've learned about the restaurant business here in Arizona, an empty restaurant at prime time on a Friday night and one that advertises breakfast on Sunday morning that is not a breakfast oriented restaurant in the first place, well it's a reflection of an establishment that is not operating as a success.  We all left sharing our predictions of how long Asado Mexican Kitchen will remain open.  Sadly, we all agreed, not much longer without vast improvements at all levels, especially the key components....the menu and ingredients."}
{"text":"Nice spot, much better than the seedy former Cocomo Joe's.  In walking into the restaurant they wanted to seat us by the door..we asked for another table more out of the way..(the place was largely empty)..the gal vanished to find a table (how hard is this in an empty place)..almost 5 mins she came back and said she found a place and asked if we would like the table to be cleaned!! No, I'll just eat the garbage left from the folks before me..geez!! The server was very nice and accommodating however. Food was so-so..the two of us each had food that tasted somewhat 'odd' although couldn't put our finger on it--had almost a somewhat 'chemical' flavor to it. Anyway, we asked for the check and left a large bill ..the server then asked 'would you like change?'.. No I think I'll leave a tip that FAR exceeds the cost of two lunches!! Please ..this idiotic staff needs some training, the cook/owner needs to taste some of the food being served. If you can't get it 'right' in a local place you are DONE..this is a local trade place, please do some 'secret shopping' and see what you diners will be dealing with. To be fair this is also fairly new so I'll give it one more try in a couple of weeks, hopefully they will 'get it right' the next time."}
{"text":"It is nice to see a new place up here in this location.  Mexican food is definitely my favorite and this food ROCKS!!  My first time in I enjoyed the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi was fantastic!  It is served with an amazing aioli, slaw, and the rice and beans.  If you like street tacos or a la carte they have those tacos too! The second time I had the shrimp ceviche & steak fajitas. The ceviche was great.  Fresh and plenty for a little meal but, holy cow those fajitas are gwwooooood!!  Served with fresh veggies and fresh tortillas.   The decor for the restaurant is great.  A modern theme for a restaurant it has high ceilings with nice tables and booths.  The restrooms are also nice and adds to the quality of the building. I will be back because they have happy hour until 7pm!  Great place to visit!"}
{"text":"Still sucks! Owners please stop running all over the place and monitor kitchen and waitstaff.  Did you tell them all to run everywhere? Hubby's beef tacos good.   Chicken taco tasted like cardboard. Don't even want to order,DECIDED A CHEESE CASA DIA WOULD BE SAFE. My husband can come back on his own. Me? This is the third strike! There are too many Mexican food restaurants that have great staff and good food. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Food is quite good. Service is usually on point as well. Mike is by far our favorite waiter, delivering a level of service that far exceeds the standard for restaurants in this price point.    Salsa: 5 stars Spinach con queso: 5 stars, must have app Steak Tacos: 4 stars Ground Beef Tacos: 5 stars Chicken Firecracker: 4 stars  Fish Tacos: 1 star (super bland to me)  My girlfriend gets the Enchilada stack and loves them.  Great food for Cave Creek area. Very cool decor and vibe. I stop by weekly."}
{"text":"Hubby and I really enjoyed Asados.  The decor is pretty, server was attentive, margaritas were delicious and the food was great.  Not sure what all the negativity is about.   It's definitely worth a second try for those who may have had a bad experience. Only downside was the salsa was a bit to hot for me.  Squeezed a half a lemon to cool it down and it was all good."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about Mexican/Latin American food; authenticity to me is my grandmothers cocina (kitchen) \"Asado\" is on point with all the foods I've tasted; salsa, elote, ceviche, shrimp tacos, beans... The colors of the walls are great, the indoor lighting very soothing, upgrades since it was kokomo joes If this was my restaurant, I'd invest more in Spanish, Mexican American Artwork we have lots of talent in AZ. Other than that Awesome place!"}
{"text":"First timers since cocomo joes closed. Came in around 8:45 pm and place was pretty much empty. We weren't sure if they were still serving food.  Still decided to go in. Service was great - thanks, Michael!!  Food was tasty and portions were decent. It's really too bad there's no entertainment after 9:00. Place would be packed if ownership listened to its customers and brought in live entertainment on the weekends. If things don't change, I can't see them here though 2015.  Again, it's unfortunate because south cave creek needs more nightlife.  Not sure if we'll be back without live entertainment."}
{"text":"Mercifully this business is closed, the owners left a large announcement on the front door blaming local customers for not supporting the restaurant.  This was predictable from the beginning when virtually everyone, myself included, panned what can only be described as wretched food.  Rather then heed the reviews on websites like this one, the owners responded by blaming customers for not knowing good food.  There are many very successful Mexican restaurants in the valley that serve excellent Mexican food, Asado Mexican Kitchen was not one of them.  The message on the door promised a different concept restaurant in the future, but what was needed was a good Mexican food place and baring that it is difficult to imagine what else would even work in that area. Eager to see the next effort."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with my girlfriend on Valentine's day of all days. They had a sign at the entrance saying the restaurant is closed during remodel. The lounge was open for lunch which was a good thing. So we sat at a table and waited for the waitress. Just like every other restaurant she asked what we wanted to drink & etc. The waitress was very nice and helpful. On yelp it stated they offered a full menu at lunch but they didn't because the kitchen was being remodeled too. That was ok, but there wasn't anything to exciting on the menu, a few appetizers and 3 lunch items.  We started with a cheese crisp which was good. Nothing too hard about that. My girlfriend ordered a Mexican pizza with carne asada and I ordered a green chile burro with carne asada, rice and black beans. Food came out promptly. First thing we noticed was the meat on the Mexican pizza was ground beef not carne asada. So we sent it back and like I said before the waitress was great. They quickly remade it with the correct meat. Both dishes look good, until we started eating. This is where it gets bad! The pizza didn't have much flavor and my dish wasn't much better. The beans and green sauce I ordered tasted like it was out of a can. The rice tasted like it was the rice dishes you can get at the grocery store. \"Riceoroni\". Really disappointed with lunch today and we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love Raquel the Host. we call for reservations and even thought it was not busy she saved us a both. My girl and I asked her what favorite app is and Raquel said you have to try the Coconut shrimp so we did and guess what its addicting. For entrees try the Pollo fundido, and the Chimy. :-)  love this place Noah & Steph."}
{"text":"Took the wife and kids out for dinner and stumbled upon this place. There was limited seating in the dining room because of remodeling. Our waiter was friendly as was the General Manager, Bernie. The kids had a cheese crisp and a quesadilla, and based on how quickly the food disappeared it must have been good. My wife had the Carne Asada quesadilla and loved it. I had the Mexican pizza with grilled chicken and the green sauce. I have no complaints and the portions were comparable to the prices. I would like to commend the young boy in charge of the chips, salsa and drinks. He stopped by our table on a consistent basis to see if we needed any refills or more chips and salsa. Can't wait to go back after the remodel is done and see what the full menu looks like."}
{"text":"We simply love this place! They have the best veggie fajitas and the staff is so friendly... We cannot wait for the dog friendly patio to be finished! Must try!"}
{"text":"This is the last time we will eat here, tried it once before very bad food, then came in on cinco de mayo it was worse, that explains why there wasn't anyone there, it's a shame because we live so close. Ordered the mini chimis, raw doughy tiny piece of chicken inside, the quesadilla was so soggy you couldn't even pick it up, salsa was all watery no flavor. Waitress was MIA the whole time had to track her down just to pay the bill. I would give them six months then adios!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service and food. The two stars are for the ambience. Ordered kid chx tenders, frozen low quality chx; too thin and all breading. Carcasada tacos was recommended by the server. They came out chewy and I took one bite and stopped. I told the server how bad it was... She said I'm sorry. That was it. No manager came by nor offered another item. Very bad and being a neighborhood restaurant you cannot afford such bad service and food. Being a restaurateur, it's very poorly ran place. On top of all that they were out of blue moon on Friday night."}
{"text":"I want this place to be good, since it's in the neighborhood - but it's falling short of the mark.   During our first time in, we had \"ok\" food and good service - but an unexpected high bill (and minimum alcohol, so it was a surprise). But I didn't feel compelled either way to write a review ... I wasn't completely under- or overwhelmed.    Tonight, it was a bad experience - and I'm not compelled to return to Asado Mexican Kitchen again. Here's the scoop:  we went in for drinks only, and it quickly became obvious that the bartender doesn't really enjoy her job (what a difference it makes when a bartender likes his/her job!). My fiancée ordered a Cosmo, and what we got was far from any Cosmo we've ever had. It tasted like there was lots of grapefruit juice in it. Is the bartender trained for her job?  Next, we figured we'd try the draft beer ... How can you go wrong with beer? The beer was good. However, on the 3rd beer, we were served a different beer than we ordered ... that's not really a big deal, but when the bartender treats you like it's your fault and she has no remorse whatsoever, one begins to wonder.  To finish the evening, my fiancée used the restroom and came back totally disgusted - it smelled pretty badly - we're talking sewer smell. We never had that experience back when it was Cocomo Joe's. Sigh.   Bummer. We had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately my first impression of this restaurant is horrible and thus will not be back. On a Tuesday afternoon with no customers in the restaurant I had to order 3 times because the first 2 items they were out of. How does a Mexican food restaurant run out of Pollo Fundido?! I will not be back as the food AND service were not good."}
{"text":"Food is good for Americanized Mexican food. Would be comparable to Macayos without any of the decor. There really is no mexican feel to this place. Even 80/90s music playing. Bought a groupon so we saved some money to try it out. I got the veggie tacos and they were good. Guacamole was \"eh\". And husband had pollo fundido. Portions were good sized and prices average. It was fine for what we needed but pretty far from home and I wasn't \"wowed\" enough to return"}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Had to ask for water several times.  Pineapple Chipotle margarita was great, but they never asked us if we wanted another round.  Salsa bland.  We asked for a spicer salsa and it never came.  Food was horrible.  Friends Mexican Pizza was a mucoid mush in the middle, way under cooked.  Fish taco was little more than some plain broiled cod on a plain corn tortilla, and a slice of avocado.  I ordered a cup of chili which said in the menu was to be served with cheese and sour cream.  It came with neither and was hot but flavorless. The wait staff seemed clueless and overworked.  I have eaten here twice now and won't' be going back."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Service throughout the night was fine, nothing at all to complain about.  Tried a specialty margarita and it was junk.  Had chicken and steak fajitas and they were eh.  My kids ordered mini chicken quesadillas and they were full of chopped onions.  For kids.  I know my kids are picky eaters, but a kid's menu item should be simple.  Anyway, they did the right thing and made new ones for the girls.  All in all, prolly won't be back.  Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Ate dinner on a Thursday night, which, unbeknownst to us, we had an option for a Date Night Thursday menu. The delicious food options we could choose from included an appetizer, 2 entrees and dessert all for under $25. We had more than enough food and the quality was even better than I expected. One of the entree options we chose was the Salmon Salad, it was delicious and huge! The staff was courteous and efficient. We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Jalapeno Inferno (the nearest Mexican restaurant) has nothing to worry about.  With one exception, the food was simply bland.  We started with the shrimp ceviche and guacamole.  Both were completely unremarkable, having very little flavor and no value with respect to presentation.  My finance had the salmon salad.  It was edible, but not good.  I had the steak fajitas.  Unlike the rest of the dishes we ordered, they were very good.    Although our server was very nice and responsive, he simply did not know the menu and appeared lost most of the time.   We observed similar behavior from the rest of the wait staff.     The one are in which the restaurant excels is the décor.  It is very modern and well-done.  At the end of the day, we will not return to this restaurant and, unfortunately, cannot recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Never been here before but it's 90 seconds from my house.  The wait was only @20 min at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Got us in and seated.  The chicken fajita was great but I need to rave about the Carne Asada chimichanga.  The meat was the most tender I have ever had.  Really top notch.  Drinks were great, ambiance was great (newly remodeled).  We even got a visit from manager Stacey who was very insightful, kind, and interested in our experience.  Nutella empanadas are amazing.  All in all, a huge hit."}
{"text":"Okay...let me start by saying I am shocked at how many people gave this place a good review.   I will be generous and start by saying some of the positives. Food was fresh... I would even call it tasty. It had a good atmosphere with a lot of potential.  However, everything was over priced, portions were on the lighter side, and the service was TERRIBLE. It took between 8-10 min just to order drinks. The waitress acted as if she'd never had a table in her life. The kids menu was on receipt paper.....and when ordered the kids cheese crisp...there was nothing crisp about it.  When we were getting near the end of our meal, the bus boy came and started collecting things as if we weren't there. He started to take things that we weren't done with and when we told him we weren't done, he looked annoyed and disgusted.   This place was beyond dissapointing."}
{"text":"Meh. Just ok. Boyfriend and I got a groupon so we tried this place today.   I ordered the jalapeño cilantro margarita and it tasted like a house margarita. I asked if they could make it a little bit spicier and when I tried that one I swear it burned my throat on the way down. One extreme to the other.   I ordered the Mexican pizza. It was essentially a cheese crisp with tomatoes and I added grilled chicken. No lettuce or anything else on it. I thought it was odd.   My boyfriend ordered the enchilada stack and it was tiny. They forgot to bring out the black beans he ordered.   We did order the sopapillas and those were amazing served with vanilla bean ice cream.   I told our waitress when we first arrived about us having the groupon. She said she would take it off the bill at the end. When the bill arrived the groupon discount had not been taken off, and I was double charged for my chicken on the Mexican pizza. It was corrected but took double the time.    We both agreed we would not return and frankly I'm glad we had $25 off from groupon because the food and service was NOT worth $50."}
{"text":"Our first time at this new restaurant on the old Cocomo Joe's location - nice changeup!  We went on a Friday night and there was quite a crowd at the bar, and the restaurant was packed already at 6:45.  Lots of families with kids, it looked like.  We were seated quickly and brought chips and salsa that were pretty standard.  Drinks arrived quickly and we were pleased to note later that our first round was Happy Hour prices, even though we weren't in the bar.  We ordered the lettuce wraps which were interesting, but just OK.  Basically the chicken burrito filling with lettuce.  For entrees we each got a burrito - skirt steak for me and pork for my hubs.  Initially they brought me the wrong burrito (chicken) but quickly corrected this.  Both were very good but the pork was a standout.  My husband did comment that he would have likeed a bit more seasoning/spiciness to the dishes.  Large portions with beans and rice, we took over half home with us.  So despite a few hiccups, I would definately go back."}
{"text":"Second time to this restaurant, had a rocky dine in first time, completely messed up the order, place had just opened so we thought we would give it another go BAD IDEA. Second try was a take out order, completely messed up the order, food cold and cheese in ENCHILADA STACK not melted, how do not melt Velveeta? I called to let them know the order was incorrect, just wants my credit card refunded, but GM stated \"just give my name next time your in and Ill make it right for you\"- not coming back wanted my 16 dollars for 2 burritos incorrectly made- not earth shattering just good customer service after messing up. I have 30 years in the restaurant industry and taking care of your customer is paramount. About 9 hours after eating here- projectile vomiting- loss day of work the next day. Lets just say I will not be returning. I wish them all the luck with this track record they will need it.  I wish I could give 0 stars."}
{"text":"Went with a Groupon and won't be back. The food was mediocre at best.  The cane asado in my burrito was slightly larger than ground beef and not flavorful. My husband had tacos with crispy shells which tasted like store bought. Nothing seemed to have been made from scratch, seemed more store bought like the average chef would do at home. I has the mango Margarita and my.husband had a Cadillac both were too sweet. Our waitress was very nice and did try hard."}
{"text":"Wife and I returned with friends for our fourth visit. They appear to still be tweaking the restaurant and their offerings. Waiter was very friendly and efficient. Met the new Manager and he explained some of the changes. Very friendly and professional.   Food was very well done as on all our visits. Will be coming back yet again."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Portions size were ok for the entrees, wing order not. 6 wings for seven dollars, they should add two more at least for that price. Service was terrible I must say. Don't think I will be back for sure. Slow on drinks, restaurant was not even busy, server not even attentive to our table. They lost out on at least one to two more rounds of drinks from our table, due to lack of service."}
