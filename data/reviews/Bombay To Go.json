{"text":"Very excellent and truly authentic indian food.  Butter chicken and Nan goes great together as do the desserts."}
{"text":"Had a butter chicken and spinach cheese curry with chicken biryani rice to go. Drive back home for 40 min, food are still hot enough to eat. Curry is tasty but bid sweet like a northern Indian curry rather than one from southern city Mumbai. It's good to try if you passed by the area, otherwise use KFI curry as a base then add extra chicken , tomato and BD's mild cheese (use butter to cook them at first then add KFI). Curry is a great food, anyway."}
{"text":"First time in tonight the dinner was fantastic.  This is our new favorite place.  Great staff, great service, and most importantly great food."}
{"text":"Once you enter this restaurant you immediately smell the intense spices and herbs. We ordered take out on a Saturday night and it was about a 35min wait time. They informed us about the longer wait time. The service was good. There are also lots of motivational posters and art work around the restaurant. 

Food wise, butter chicken was tender and flavorful! Definitely would recommend this dish as advertised! The second dish we ordered was the housewife's special green curry. I was personally not a fan of this due to the strong coriander taste. 

Price for butter chicken was $12.99 and included one rice. I will post pictures of the menus along with my review. I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Best food I ever tried. Their food is so yummy and best flavoured. Omg the butter chicken is so addicting...

Highly recommended mainly for the taste and also for the service they give."}
{"text":"Great place to eat \"naan&curry\", as their lunch specials cost only $8.99! We loved the just baked Butter Naan and the addicting Butter Chicken Curry.
Especially, the service was awsome!! Love to come back soon :)"}
{"text":"Butter chicken ...butter chicken..butter chicken...all i  can say is wow. I tried green chicken too but i liked the butter chicken most, their naan breads are very well done. The atmosphere is ok ok but the food makes you forget everything."}
{"text":"meh, decent , nothing speciall, pretty pricey for indian food,"}
{"text":"Great place...Amazing food...I love their Butter chicken......My Indian kitchen. ..when I crave for delicious Indian meal. .at the comfort of my home. .delivery is hot and quick....Must try....-:)"}
{"text":"Not the best Indian you'll ever have, but a very solid take-out place. We've ordered from this play ~20 times. Their veg. pakora are outstanding and their butter chicken are almost as good as they claim. Their mutter paneer is good but not the best, and their tikka masala curries are flavourful. Their portions are always large and you can bank on left-overs for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"It is a great mom and pop restaurant.  Did is nice.  Their green chicken is unique, never seen it before in other Indian restaurants.  Would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I tried their butter chicken and chicken Tikka masala. It is really tasty and highly recommended to all the food lovers."}
{"text":"This is the place I go to when I'm looking for for good Masala Chai, and tasty Indian food! It's not just the taste that brings me here - The food is always freshly made."}
{"text":"Indian food is one of my hangover remedies and I always go with Bombay to Go.  They're friendly on the phone and the food usually arrives withing 30-45 minutes.  The delivery guys, who I sadly know quite well as I am always hungover, are very personable.  I'm not going to say the food is the best I've ever had but damn it's good when you're on the couch recuperating.  I recommend the palak paneer and the chicken/lamb vindaloo."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place because they have a poster  on there building saying best butter chicken . 
So my daughter treated me to a $9.99 butter chicken lunch special .
What I got was  container of white  chicken meat in butter sauce with a perfect spice a bowl with rice and some naan bread .
Great value and a great meal .
For a big boy I was happy .
If your a hipster that dinner for 2 
Now to say if there the best butter chicken that's for you to decide .
I really liked it .
My daughter cooks butter chicken so that all I am saying ."}
{"text":"Best curry that I've ever had. Came in for dining and ordered delivery from here, every time the food is made perfectly and the naan is so delicious. The butter chicken is the best in the city. I order from this restaurant weekly and has always loved the food. 

The service here is amazing as well. 

5 stars for food and service!!!"}
{"text":"A genuinely good place for Indian delivery. I've ordered from here twice and both times food came piping hot & fresh. Delivery orders are not a surprise to these people. They know how to deliver food. 

In terms of taste, it's not as zesty as I would like but when it's late night, and your craving some hot and spicy this should definitely be a go to place. The food tastes very good. And it's not overly oily or greasy which I truly appreciate.

Ive had the 

Butter chicken : the gravy is really good, big chunks of white meat --it's not marinated though so it's lacking that extra zing that Indian food has. Regardless, I'm Indian and I'm a butter chicken snob. Try the butter chicken, it hits the spot when needed. Especially because it comes piping hot and tastes very fresh. 

Lamb curry: this is very good. The boneless chunks of lamb are melt in your mouth tender, but still holds its shape. The gravy is perfectly spiced. Must try.

Dal makhni: black lentil curry, this is also really well made. Nicely spiced.

Garlic naan: not a fan of their naans. They're super thick and get rubbery once it starts to cool down. They don't use fresh garlic on the naans either so they don't have that garlicky taste. Would not order again 

Basmati rice: nicely cooked. 

All in all this place is great for when you want a hearty meal but don't feel like leaving your house!"}
{"text":"My first visit... Tried take-out. Butter chicken was perfect, enjoyed it. The paneer tikka masala was not up to the mark...seemed to have just chilli and lacked the flavour. The interior looks neat and not fussy about unwanted decor which I loved. In fact Hindi-Cinema enthusiasts will love the faces of all the tester years stars framed behind the counter."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot, came for the jumbo meal deal 

1 butter chicken, rice , naan, 2 samosas and a mango lassi - 20$ 

Everything came quick fresh and hot and the server was so sweet 

Food was great. No complaints. Perfect amount of food for two people!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here the other night and I have to say it was a great meal to top off a night of drinking. 

We ordered plain naan, butter chicken, eggplant, and shrimp bhuana. Everything was fresh and delicious. What I really liked about this place is that you can choose the spicy level. I choose \"medium\" for all of our dishes, which was nice and hot (the way I like it) but not insane.  My SO had the butter chicken which he said was delicious. The chicken was cooked well and the sauce was thick and creamy. I had the shrimp and the eggplant, both very flavourful and tasty. What I appreciated about my dishes is that they weren't super greasy or creamy like some Indian places. They were lighter but without compromising on taste. My only complaint was that the shrimp dish could have had more shrimp in it.

I asked to sub the rice for naan, which they ignored, so it's a good thing that I ordered an extra  plain naan since I don't like rice. The naan was perfect, good portion and well cooked. My partner said the rice was good and happily ate my portion too. 

I have to say that I've found a new favourite takeout place for late-night cravings."}
{"text":"This review is based mostly on take out and one delivery experience. The lunch specials are tasty and the portion is generous. Comes with rice and naan. The chicken vindaloo and chicken cream curry are consistently delicious! Tried the Shahi paneer once and while it tasted good, I wished there were more pieces of paneer. The guy who works the front desk is nice."}
{"text":"I have only ordered delivery from here. The food is amazing. Quite reasonable in price even though a little on the above average price range. I love the Chicken Karahi and anything they BBQ (tandoor).

So, why a 4 star? At any given time the person answering the phone is always in a rush. It feels as if the servers are on double duty and in a hurry to go to their tables.

All in all though, a good restaurant with the delivery option for Indian food."}
{"text":"Been living in the area for a while now, but came upon this place for the first time. 
Hadn't had anything to eat since the morning so I ordered in almost immediately after they opened :P. 
Quick service though. The food, Karahi Paneer and Tandoori Chicken, was hot and fresh.
Tandoori Chicken - one of the better ones that I have had in Mississauga; perfectly spiced, cooked well and good serving - expensive price though for 2 drumsticks and 2 thighs.
Karahi Chicken - a little disappointing; not spicy as I would have thought especially after I asked for the spicy option; good amount of paneer, big cubes; 
Would want to try again !"}
{"text":"This was a delivery and a summary review by four diners, some of who spent time in New Delhi, Goa and Mumbai.  Service was easy, convenient and fast, however the food was surprisingly bad. 

Garlic Naan was a disappointment cracker like quality, garlic seem to be from dried.  

Lamb Vindaloo gets zero stars as the four diners who tried it agreed it was clearly beef and not lamb, and bland.  Aren't cows sacred?  This is usually my favourite Indian portugeuse influenced dish and was unsettling.  

Butter Chicken/ Shahi Paneer We couldn't tell the difference between these 2 dishes as though they filled two contains with the same sauce and added over cooked chicken to one and cottage cheese to the other.   

Chana Masala - undercooked and bland, we rescued it by cooking it again and adding to it.  ."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery with them and I received the food earlier than anticipated! Nice surprise. 

The food was also very tasty. My favourite is their samosas. The vegetable pakora was a little disappointing. 

All in all a tasty meal, reasonable price, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers!"}
{"text":"Well this place is very proud to claim that it has the best butter chicken in Mississauga, so it is definitely time to check it out.

Inside is a very nicely decorated small restaurant with a mix of booths and tables with  humorous quotes on the walls and a very friendly man to greet you behind the counter so top marks for first impressions.

We put in our order for the $9.99 lunch special; butter chicken and channa, and a dessert.

The wait for the lunch was a bit on the long side - especially seeing as we were the only ones in the restaurant. But hey- its going to be worth it when Mississauga's best butter chicken comes to the table.

Well- lunch came. The Naan was absolutely spot on. The channa had the  cupboard taste of canned chick peas with no real depth of flavour. And the butter chicken? Tasty texture and creamy, but again, no depth of flavour, and certainly far from the best butter chicken in the city. 

To its credit, portions were very generous for the price. So we gobbled it all up, and just as we were halfway through, our server decides its time to watch a movie on his laptop and catch up on his spreadsheets behind the counter- so his movie audio is drowning out the ambiance of the instrumental music playing, and it must have been some complex spreadsheets because we waited and waited and waited for table to be cleared and for our dessert to come.

After waiting far too long, we got fed up, went up to the counter and paid for our meal.

A disappointing end to a well priced meal in a really nice setting. Unfortunately, there isn't enough there for us to come back."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. We ordered take out and got the butter chicken, chicken tikka and chana masala. All of which were absolutely delicious. They serve tasty basmati rice with their dishes and the butter chicken was awesome, normally places serve it with more sauce than actual chicken but this place did a fantastic job with the portions. Will definitely order again"}
{"text":"To learn to appreciate this place you really have to have an open mind as one time I had delivery from there and it wasn't really good. Probably the best way to describe the food is really homestyle just the kind of you food you might make at home.
This time I went into the restaurant to try the again. The flavors are not exactly North Indian but tasty for instance tonight I tried the lamb Bruna which had yellow and green peppers in it and tasted more like a Caribbean roti filling rather then a rich and  heavy tradition curry.
The great thing about the food is unlike the Brar buffet which is in the same plaza you won't find the food here really oily or filled with cream like at most Indian places which tend to be very heavy and full of calories.
I also tried the chicken tikka which was pretty good but not as flavorful as I hoped. The meat that was of good quality and similar again to what I would make it home."}
{"text":"I love that they deliver but even more so I love their Channa masala! It is so tasty! 

The flavours here are so complex and good. 

I don't know anything about authenticity. But I know that I couldn't stop eating! 

Also the garlic Naan was perfection. Not too much cilantro like some other places like to put. But lots and lots of garlic! Which is exactly what I wanted. 

Give these guys a try I'm sure you won't be let down."}
{"text":"My co-worker recommended this place. Went here with some of my work buddies. This is hands down, some of the best punjabi food i ever had. I have tried punjabi food all over the world (except Punjab itself) and this beats everything.

I have been here 3 times and it tasted just as good each time. I never realized how a palak panner should taste until i tried this place. This is a must visit for any Indian and non-Indian food lover.

Great work guys, keep up.

PS: try their Salt Lassi, its quite amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty good Indian place in Mississauga. The decor is very cheeky, which I enjoyed. Rather than have a display board of menu items, they have signs instructing you to pick up a menu from the cashier to order. They also don't have wifi and encourage their customers to \"talk to each other\", which I found hilarious. 

I got takeout from here, and was impressed with how quickly the food was ready despite having other customers also waiting for their food. Their menu items allow for mild, medium, and spicy options, which is a nice touch. Since it was my first time here, I got one dish as mild and one dish as medium. The \"mild\" has zero heat, so that would be preferable for people who can't or don't like to eat spicy food. The \"medium\" I would classify as mild, since it has a bit of heat to it. The takeout portions are quite large, and the curries each come with white rice, so ordering one dish is more than enough for one person. I was a little disappointed to see that the butter chicken only contained a few pieces of chicken and was mostly (though delicious!) sauce. Maybe it was just our one dish though because our paneer selection came with plenty of paneer and other veggies. We also got butter naan and garlic naan (we didn't know the curries came with rice), and both were pretty good. 

All in all, I'd say it's a pretty good spot for takeout if you're craving some decent Indian food."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this restaurant. We come here a lot as the food is amazing! The owner cares about using quality and fresh food ingredients and provides great customer service. My favorite dishes are the lamb bhuna and alhoo gobhi. This is not what I would call a fast food restaurant despite the name of the place. The owner is good at catering to the likes of his customers!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to indian place. The food is all top notch and super tasty and you get great value for what you pay for (seriously, most items end up providing enough for next day's lunch). Bonus: most items come with rice, unlike every other place that charges you a couple of bucks for plain basmati!

You can also select your level of spiciness on pretty much every item.

Seriously can't recommend this place enough - try it yourself to find out."}
{"text":"Its not bad. I like the butter chicken.l, but it's now cheap. I gonna try something new next time. Maybe green chicken?  Also, the staffs there are friendly."}
{"text":"These guys claim to be \"the best butter chicken- voted by a guy who loves butter chicken\" and let me tell you they stand up to their claim not only that $9.99 lunch special with rice and Naan is AMAZING!!! You get a full dish of butter chicken all white meat an entire piece of Naan and a decent sized portion of rice all for the low price of $9.99 that's cheaper then McDonalds! 

Rant over let's go over everything now!

The service: I called ahead to place my order and was told 30 minutes. I ordered 3 $9.99 lunch specials for myself and my dad. 2 Butter Chicken and 1 Chicken Vindoloo. When I got to the restaurant after 20 minutes I waited about 5 minutes for my food so you definitely know it's made fresh which is an A+ in my books.

The Restaurant: although I didn't eat there the restaurant was clean, well lit and filled with some fun pictures the service in the restaurant was good everyone was friendly!

The Menu: they have a lot of different dishes and a lot on their $9.99 lunch special menu so you can definitely find something for everyone 

The food: everything I ordered was perfect! This was our first time trying chicken Vindoloo and it's definitely a good one in my books! The butter chicken was amazing and is comparable to many more expensive Indian restaurants.

This place is a little hidden in the complex but it's definitely worth going to! In my opinion this is probably one of the best cheap eats in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Tip:  Not a \"cheap\" Indian place.  Menu is online and they do not offer % discount on cash orders.

For example, their \"Jumbo Meal Deal\" comprises of 1 Butter Chicken, a coupla samosas, 2 naans, rice, & mango lassi is $20.99.  It's good for 2 hungry people.  You may have some rice or gravy left over, but that's about it.  Butter Chicken on its own is $14.99.

Having said that, I believe their food is made-to-order as you can choose mild-medium-spicy.  So they're not serving curries from vats made whenever.

Flavours were good, bright, and fresh!  Nothing too oily, greasy, or salty.  We also ordered a Matar Paneer Jalfrezi ($12.99) which did not taste store-bought.  Paneer had a softer texture and it wasn't salted.  Taste was similar to ricotta cheese.  Out of the 2 dishes, the Butter Chicken was tastier!  Unless you overeat, you won't feel UGH.

My only critiques are that:  
1.  It's pricier than their competitors;
2.  Naan came in an aluminum-lined bbq bag and it was soggy by the time I ate it."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered the chicken vindaloo. They were worried it would be too spicy for me lol. It was amazing!! Exactly the spice level I was looking for. Great flavours. Overall great experience. Can't wait to go back and try more menu items."}
{"text":"Ordered from here for our company lunch a couple times and I must say I love it!  They do delivery which is a major plus especially when you're too lazy to pick up the food yourself.  It works great as we get great tasting food for lunch at work!  I always get the lunch special which gives you any one option of chana masala, shahi paneer, daal tadka, butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and chicken vindaloo, served with rice and naan for only $8.99.  This lunch special is only up to 3 p.m. but it is definitely worth it.

I've never actually been here since I've always done delivery but it does take about an hour for your food to arrive.  Also, the amount of meat they put in your meal is worth what you are paying for!

Love ordering work lunch from here and won't stop anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I usually get take-out or delivery from here. There is limited seating inside, if you do go.

I usually order two chicken dishes in tomato sauce with rice and garlic naan.  The chicken is good quality all-white meat and very flavorful. The naan bread is my  favorite - they slice up actual pieces of garlic (instead of using garlic salt/powder like some places!) so delicious when eaten warm!  The price is decent, usually runs me about $35 on average for two.

Delivery time is average."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery not knowing what to expect. 
Came so quick -45 min from the time we ordered to the time it was at the door. 
We got the spring rolls, vegetable pakora(needed to be cooked a little longer), Samosas (which could have used salt), chicken Tika, lamb biriani, garlic nan (became soggy quickly because of the bag it came in). 
But even with the little things we didn't like the food still was amazing!
The chicken Tika was so juicy!
I put the nan in the oven for 10 min and it was good as new. 
Will be ordering take out again from them!"}
{"text":"We went bombai to go last night and we order for chicken briyani.  The taste it is so bland and $11.30 including tax is not worth."}
{"text":"Tasty excellent quality and service I am hooked ! ordering right now !"}
{"text":"Lovely food and friendly staff.

My husband and I tried this place yesterday, while out running errands. It's definitely casual, but has a clean and recently updated interior, with funny sayings adorning the walls.

Our server was really polite and very attentive, and another member of staff checked on us while we were eating to make sure everything was okay.

The food itself had lots of flavor. We ordered paneer poppers as a starter, and a curry each. The naan was perfect, and added a lovely texture to the meal. Both our curries were wonderful, food was served hot and obviously used very fresh ingredients.

They became pretty busy with delivery orders as we were getting ready to leave, but the service remained excellent. Highly recommend."}
