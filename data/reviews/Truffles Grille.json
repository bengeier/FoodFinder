{"text":"My parents had received a free bottle of wine offer for this place, so they invited my hubby & I to go try it out. My mom had made reservations for Friday night at 7:30. Thank goodness my parents are always on time because I made my hubby & I about 20 mintues late, oops-I'm working on the whole being late BS! Any way, we had never been to this shopping center before so we had a lil trouble finding it. From the outside it looks pretty big, but once inside it's a lot smaller. The restaurant was pretty full but honestly I could hardly see! I am all for dim lighting but it was way too dark in there.   The server gave my parents an Amuse Bouche before we arrived. I believe it was just bread with oilive oil, all my parents said was it was a tiny piece of bread, hmmm. They also ordered the prosciutto, hearts of palm & artichoke app. I did not sample this but my parents & hubby said it was pretty good. I wanted to try the crispy goat cheese app so we ordered that as well. The goat cheese was excellent, very delicious & creamy. But for $8.50 I expected a bit more than just 3 tiny pieces. For our free bottle of wine we chose a Riesling, Chateau St. Michelle. My hubby & I enjoyed it & my dad said he did also but he definitely prefers reds over whites, my mom doesn't drink. FYI- The free bottle offer is for wines priced at $28, so we had to pay the $4 difference. What I found sort of strange was that the complimentary bread & butter was brought out way after our apps were served. The bread was a slighty sweet multigrain, which we all liked, but the butter was hard & not easy to spread. For our entrees we ordered the following: mom- seafood platter, dad- ahi tuna (rare), hubs- scallops wrapped in prosciutto & me- garlic shrimp. Mom's was yummy- loved the salmon & scallops, dad's was yummy also- cooked perfectly, hub's was my personal fav & mine was just ok. We decided to skip dessert but our server generously brought out a truffle for us to sample. I believe it was milk chocolate with macadamian nuts, pretty darn tasty!  Our total (not including tip) came to about $160, I forgot to mention that my dad & hubby ordered a cocktail each, so not too bad for 4 people. They really are 4 star worthy, but service was so slow, we didn't get out of there till almost 10pm (when they close)! However, the chef did come out to say hello & ask how everything was, which I always appreciate. We just might give Truffles another try sometime..."}
{"text":"I so wanted to be able to write a fabulous review about this new restaurant located at the Scottsdale Summit (in the old Dos Diablos space). Everything pointed to having a special experience from the free bottle of wine marketed in their mail piece to the menu on line. Just looking at the menu, with its varied choices of appetizers, soups and salads, and multitude of entrees made my mouth water. I couldn't wait!   At first we were put off by the scowl on the face of the hostess. She seemed very preoccupied and not in a pleasant mood. It's a Saturday night and people are out to have a good time. You are the first impression for a new restaurant in N. Scottsdale. All she had to do was smile . . . but she didn't. Thank goodness that was a brief close encounter of the negative kind and didn't spoil our evening.   Our server Justin quickly turned my frown upside down with his easy-going, yet efficient style. To get us off to a culinary start, Justin brought out an amuse bouche of gorgonzola and a tiny bite of prime steak. Not bad . . . a little too well, but it would be hard not to overcook a 1/2\" x 1/2\" cube of meat.   I ordered the \"legendary\" Caesar salad which was huge. My first bite was delicious . . . then all I could taste was an abundance of garlic that lingered and lingered and lingered some more. My hubby had the wild mushroom potage which was described as lighter than bisque, but actually was more like a consomme. Our waiter forewarned us that the kitchen does not salt the food, so in went the table salt which made it more palatable.   Among the four of us, we all chose different entrees -- Succulent Free Range Organic Chicken Breast With Kalamata Olives, Mushrooms and Crisp Pancetta, Makers Mark Bourbon Baby Back Ribs, Grilled Garlic Shrimp, and Glazed Rack of Veal Chop. The chicken, shrimp, and baby back ribs rated 6 and 7 out of 10. My husband said the the ribs were indeed pork ribs but in no way resembled the texture or succulent juiciness of fall off the bone baby back ribs. The flavor, however, hit a distinct high note! My Veal Chop was immense in size and while they didn't cook it perfectly medium on the first try (I had to send it back), it was a beautiful juicy chop that when it came back, it melted in my mouth. All the entree accompaniments, from the twice-baked lobster Yukon potatoes to the seafood rice were perfect. Just remember to add a little salt . . . Speaking of salt, our waiter informed us that eventually they will be making their own salt (has anyone ever heard of that before?)   Aside from the food, the pros:  The space is lovely and has a great ambiance with soft lighting and a couple large comfortable bar-lounge areas. Soft piano music plays in the background and you can actually carry on a nice conversation. Service was even and attentive. Water glasses were kept full. Wine glasses refilled. Plates not removed before everyone was done . . . they didn't rush us between courses . . . what you would expect from a nice restaurant in North Scottsdale.   The cons:  Still in the trial and error phase. Truffles has definitely set some lofty goals for itself by proclaiming itself a culinary experience. They didn't offer bottled or sparkling water, and while we didn't opt for dessert, they didn't give us the option of having any coffee or tea, and assumed we were done (we were, but it doesn't excuse them from not asking)! Also, when we were seated, they gave us little slips of paper to write our comments on at the end of the meal. It was tacky. Don't get me wrong here. I think it is fantastic that they want to gauge their success and failures, but shredded pieces of xeroxed paper is not the way to do it. There was hope when the chef came out to greet us before the kitchen started to get busy -- he said he would check back with us -- but never did. That would have been the appropriate way to get feedback, and who doesn't like to meet the chef!!!!   My suggestions . . . highlight the \"Truffles\" in any way you can. For example, serve fresh bread that can be dipped in truffled oil and vinegar to start, and perhaps end with a small sampling of dessert truffles at the end of the meal with the check. It will help the name stick from the beginning to the end.   We'll give Truffles another try for certain because so many items on the menu sounded good . . . let's see if they can bring the flavor to the table! I hope they make it because we need a nice comfortable dining place up here in way North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"First I would like to say this is exactly what we have been waiting for in North Scottsdale..IIT WAS AMAZING!! When we first arrived as a walk-in (not knowing it was almost necessary) the hostess let us know it be a few minutes before seating and that we may have a drink at one of the two bars or sit in their lounge waiting area. We choose to Wait in the lounge seats, as we waited a server came by and asked us if we would like a glass of cocktail while we waited. The wait was only about 10 minutes before having us sat. Wants sat we were almost immediately greeted by our server and in hand was a little amuse bouche ( a wonderful little taste of NY strip and spices). He then offered us a personal light as it is a dimly light restaurant all the while going over nights features. Seafood Cakes, Veal Chops and Pacific Seabass. He helped us choose a wonderful bottle of Cakebread Chardonnay after allowing me and my other half decide what we we were going to do. Myself had gone with the servers feature of the  AMAZING Seabass. It was so moist and flaking and everything he described, with a wonderful citrus/ginger sauce. My other had going with salmon which was also cooked perfectly and had  a great little sauce and amazing little red potatoes to go along with it. At the end of the meal our server showed us the nights desserts and although they all looked great we went with his suggestion of the Zeppole which were amazing light fried doughs with berry and chocolate sauce. Overall this place was great and we will be dinning again and again to see what they will do next... We also grabbed to Chocolate Truffles to  go on the way out which were a wonderful midnight snack later in the evening. GREAT PLACE."}
{"text":"I too, had great expectations for this new eatery in North Scottsdale.  After looking at the rather extensive menu (should have been a warning), I was intrigued to give it a try.  My date and I had reservations at 7:45 this past Saturday and was told by the hostess that there may be a 15 minute wait.  I wasn't sure why she just didn't make the reservation at 8:00 pm, but not a problem.  We showed up at 8:00 and were promptly seated.  We were greeted by a nice flute of champagne which was a nice touch.  The table was a bit tight with my seat jutting out into the aisle.  I felt that at any moment, I could have had something spilled on my head, so I scooted over to the side.  Again, not a problem.  Our server came by to ask for drinks and I mentioned that this was our first time, and wanted him to recommend something that would make us want to come back.  He thought for a moment and thought some more.  I tried to take the pressure off him by asking what other patrons have enjoyed.  He again paused and then said the steaks were good and so was the salmon, but unfortunately, they had run out of the salmon.  I asked him what he liked and he said that he hadn't tried that many items on the menu.  That was a huge red flag and a training issue, but I still had my hopes up.    I ended up ordering the Foie Gras, and my date ordered the famous Caesar salad.  Then for the main course, I had the seafood mix over rice and my date had the Prime rib eye, medium rare plus.    First issue was the bland bread they served.  It almost seemed that the bread could have been baked a bit longer.  It was served with some crystallized whipped butter that tasted sweet.  I asked the server and he mentioned that the butter had honey in it.  Again, appreciate the effort, but cold, crystallized, honey butter with bland bread was not appealing.  I asked for regular butter and the next batch tasted the same, so I ended up passing on the bread.  Next, came the Foie Gras and the salad.  The Foie Gras was cold, almost slimy in texture and seemed undercooked.  It should have been seared.  It was served with some field greens and poached pear.  The pear was the best thing on the plate.  The crostini was so hard that it actually hurt to eat.  Toast points would have been a better choice.  I ended up eating the Foie Gras only because it was an $18 appetizer.  The famous Caesar salad was very good with nicely shaved parmesan cheese on top.  The romaine lettuce was chilled and the dressing wasn't overly garlicky so it seems that they fixed this.   So far, not very good.  The main course came out shortly.  The seafood mix was \"just ok\" with the two large jumbo shrimp being overcooked.  The fish and scallops were above average.  The rice was barely warm and a bit hard.    The rib eye was served on a room temperature plate, and was very under cooked.  It was basically rare.  This was a $36 piece of prime that Mastros or even Ruth Chris would never ruin.  The only hot item on my plate was the small potatoes and that was because they were slightly charred.  The onions were soggy and not crisp as they should have been served.    My date and I struggled to enjoy the evening.  Thanks to the two champagne glasses and wine, we managed to survive.  I wouldn't even consider the dessert.   The entire meal was around $120 and I would have rather eaten at Mastros or Pane Vino, down the street.  I was really hoping for this to be a success.  Living in Carefree, we don't have a lot of fine dining that's very close.  I give this experiment 6 months if they don't drastically change their operations."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful.   Scallops wrapped in proscuitto were incredible.  The scallops were huge and cooked to perfection.  The rack of Lamb was as perfectly rare as requested and came with the most surprising fig sauce.  It did not overpower but instead complimented the meat creating an experience different than the sum of the two flavors.  The flourless chocolate cake was as good as it looked and was accompanied by coffee that tasted as if it had been roasted to order.  One caveat, avoid the appetizer with hearts of palm, artichoke heart and prosciutto.   There was no meat to speak of."}
