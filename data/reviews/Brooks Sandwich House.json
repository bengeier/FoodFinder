{"text":"I've been  eating here over 30 years, long before it became fashionable on the edge of modern yuppievillle. Wonderful family that makes great food. This place is a part of Charlotte history."}
{"text":"We had lunch about week ago and as always, excellent cheeseburger, but this time we added bacon. A great addition to an already fantastic cheeseburger. Look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Good burger but not great or the best as advertised.  Cheese and chili fries were above ave as well.  Very good."}
{"text":"This has got to be one of the best burger places in Charlotte hands down. The burger is so juicy, the fries are amazing, everything about it is amazing! I had this for breakfast one day and honestly it was AMAZING. One of the best burger breakfasts I've had lol, I recommend it for anyone who wants a really great burger!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! This was my first visit and I will DEFINITELY go back for more! Food is awesome, staff is great, and price is spot on!! Got to meet the owner and I must say that he is a good fella to talk with and he has a VERY good thing going!! Keep it up!!"}
{"text":"The chili cheeseburger is phenomenal!! The place is a hole-in-the-wall but its a must try!! They only accept cash and there is no seating. There is a big picnic table behind the restaurant (beside the trash cans), and its not uncommon to see white collar and blue collar workers enjoying a classic American burger at this table. During lunch, the line wraps around the building. If you love burgers, you have to try this place.  They also make an excellent sausage sandwich for breakfast."}
{"text":"I LOVE a dive! This qualifies in spades.  Kinda under the tracks around the way; obscure. You gotta know where you're going.  Parking lot has picnic tables. Inside: tight space standing room only (maybe six or so can fit without getting too icky), quintessential divey d√©cor, old signs etc.  Ventilation system struggling to keep the smell of cooking food to a minimum.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Not a bad idea to call ahead and yes, have cash.  I'm trying to talk about all the great dive like qualities they have with out addressing the food.  I loved the vibe.  Ok.  The food?  Not so great.  The exalted chili?  Bland.  I detected some black pepper but salt not so much. It was meaty, give credit there. Ground beef cooked up with onions; that's what I saw(you can see them cooking) not much else.  Nothing to make it come together. I really liked all about them I experienced in the world of dives, but the food.  Just not there.  Is it a value?  Hard to say.  If I want to enjoy it? Not really. There's a place not too far that  gives loads of cheap food at ridiculous prices.  That's value. No matter how mediocre their service the food is at least seasoned.  I really wanted to like this place more.  The people and atmosphere seemed just right.  The food was just wrong."}
{"text":"Love this place. No gourmet burger here...so if that's what you're looking for then move on (I'd suggest Bricktop's burger for that). This is just a good old fashioned straight to the point burger. I order a cheeseburger \"all the way\" (mustard, onions and chili). Delicious and extremely messy! They have no where to sit, but they do have a table that you can stand up and eat at outside. Makes you feel like you're some sort of animal but I don't even care. I usually end up just eating in the car if it's particularly hot outside. Sweet tea is good. Don't even ask for unsweet tea. My mom made this mistake and the lady responded with: \"WE AINT GOT NO UNSWEET TEA\". Haha...still makes me laugh to this day. Great lunch place, give it a try."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time.  Reminded me of burger joints when I was younger in my hometown.  No frills, cash only, all totals come out to an even dollar.  Cheeseburger all the way, mustard, onions, and chili.  I'll go back, especially when I feel homesick."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally give 5 stars to any place, but I've had a lot of burgers and nothing beats Brooks. Order yourself a cheeseburger all the way (southern style: cheese, onions, chili, mustard) and be prepared for the most delicious mouth-gasm ever.  Their hours are weird, they only accept cash but it is worth going out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"Chili Dogs \"All The Way\" here are pretty quintessential \"carolina style\" and not to be missed.  Add slaw for a twist.  The burgers are also perfect."}
{"text":"Got a cheeseburger all the way with chili. The chili is a joke and the burger I can get anywhere. 6.50 for a burger small fries and a can of coke was pretty insulting. The fact it was voted Charlottes best burger makes me question the taste of Charlotte. I would not mention eating here to anyone."}
{"text":"Holy Moses. If you live in Charlotte or anywhere close by, you MUST visit Brooks. I love burgers and this place is amazing. I had the cheese burger with lettuce and tomato and chili cheese fries. Outstanding. The only thing missing is a runny egg to go on top!"}
{"text":"This is a must stop at least once kind of place.  It was a great burger $3.50 with cheese.   Limited menu but what they do they do well.  If your in Charlotte you have to make the Brooks pilgrimage at least once."}
{"text":"I thought about how good that fish sandwich was all day. It was big enough, but I think next time I will just order two... Cause I'm 'Merican."}
{"text":"Took my wife and son to experience this Charlotte institution and to be honest it was the worst burger I've had in quite a while. Meat was dry and burnt and eating it all the way just tried to mask the non flavor. Fries were also too thick, bland and not very good. As much as everyone raves about this place, I just don't see it."}
{"text":"One of those businesses that do what they do best they are not fancy or clean but the food and prices are hard to beat. A nice little place full of locals that appear to stop often as I also find myself doing."}
{"text":"Such a generous and friendly staff!  Family owned and operated, this is what small business is all about!"}
{"text":"Great burger shack serving tasty burgers and fries.  Nothing fancy, but just good, meaty burgers. No indoor seating. Counter service. Cash only. They also serve breakfast."}
{"text":"This is an awesome experience if you ever want to have a burger like you have never ever had one before. The flavor just explodes in your mouth. There will definitely be a party in your mouth and tummy if you go to this place and eat."}
{"text":"Located in the NoDa area just outside of Uptown Charlotte, Brooks Sandwich House has been in operation since the 1970's and remains as authentic today as it has for decades. On the inside you'll find there's no seating, no \"real\" ordering line, no fancy decor, or anything else that resembles your average restaurant  Instead you walk in the front door and are immediately standing in the kitchen with only a counter between you and Brooks' World Famous Burgers.  After carefully considering what to get on our first trip and a little persuasion from the staff we decided to go for a bacon cheeseburger, a bacon cheeseburger \"all the way\", a hot dog \"all the way\", french fries, and a sweat tea. One of the things that Brooks' is best know for is their chili. Its pretty much considered an atrocity to dine at Brooks' without getting chili on something. Brooks' World Famous Chili is even being sold at your local Harris Teeter... that's how important this stuff is.   So after a few minutes of waiting and looking around, we realized just how much Brooks' reminded us of our favorite burger joint in Lynchburg \"Texas Inn\" aka the \"T\" Room. The rustic, authentic, local, anti-glamour type of foodie hangout that makes non-locals easy to point out. Then we got our food and headed outside to find out if Brooks' was all hype.. or whether or not locals had been on to something for the last few decades.  Brooks' lacks a lot of the creature comforts traditional to most restaurants but it doesn't seem to damper anybody's craving for their mouthwatering and handcrafted burgers. We walked outside and quickly realized we had four options  1- Bring the food home 2 - Eat in our car 3 - Eat on our car 4 - Eat at the long wooden table in the shade  It was an absolutely beautiful day so we chose to take full advantage of the quality lighting and setup on the hood of our super fancy Pontiac Grand Am.   To say the food looked too good to take pictures would be an understatement. All I could think of was how quickly I wanted to get the photos out of the way so my teeth could sink deep into the handcrafted and perfectly cooked hamburger patty topped with cheese, bacon, onions, chili, and mustard. Love at first bite is the best way to describe our experience at Brooks'. After a few minutes of the HOT.. HOT.. HOT sun beating down on us we sought out refuge in the shade and relocated our grub to the long wooden table behind the restaurant.  After consuming every last bite and taking a long hard look from an outsiders perspective of the restaurant and the claim of being \"Home of the World's Best Burger\"... we decided it fell a little shy of the high expectation we had at the beginning. It was love at first bite and we would definitely recommend it to any foodie looking to get a taste of Charlotte's history. But with that aside... it was not \"Home of the World's Best Burger\". Instead we found it to be home of a really good and fresh made piece of Charlotte burger bliss."}
{"text":"Here I am... I made it! I've been trying to eat the burgers here for years but couldn't make it happen until now! They stop serving food at 2pm, and I have to pick my dog up from the SpayNeuter facility near by at 3, so I ventured out here as early as possible to treat my self. My first mistake was not bringing cash, my second mistake was not checking to see if they had an ATM inside the building. Instead, I walked to the entrance and read the sign on the door \"CASH ONLY\" - Oops! so I returned to my car defeated. No! I came all this way, I must eat this burger! So I went on an adventure through NoDa looking for an ATM which wasted 20 minutes!  For the record, They DO have an ATM inside.  So I get a burger and hot dog all the way, because that's what you do when you try a local favorite spot; you order the recommended specialties. I did ask to add slaw to my hot dog tho.. anyways... Sadly, despite all my effort - I was not blown away by anything about the food. Perhaps I shall return again and tweak my toppings a little. Maybe then I'll find what the hype is all about. But rest assured, I won't be in any hurry to return."}
{"text":"Small little hole-in-the-wall place that's right behind the Highland Mills Lofts in NoDa. No seating inside (there are some wooden tables outside to stand and eat) and CASH ONLY.   Had heard a lot about this place but never could find myself around the area when it was open until yesterday. There was a line when I came in around 12pm as well as people already eating outside. Ordered a cheeseburger all-the-way (chili, mustard, and onion) and added bacon with coleslaw. Since this was my first time and I wasn't sure when I'd be back, I splurged and ordered the chili cheese fries too.  The burger - delicious! I personally enjoy a burger the most when I feel like the patty is big enough to fill you (and the bun) up but not so big that you need to cut it in half. Was it nice and pretty? Definitely not but it tasted great. When I come back, I'll probably hold the bacon only because it added a salty taste which was good but took away from the flavoring of the burger, chili, mustard and slaw. Again, with the burger being a great size, the chili really complimented everything. It was barely messy at all and you could taste all the toppings.   Chili cheese fries - they were good, not great. Lots of grease from the chili and cheese which was expected. I could barely see any cheese on the fries though. If their chili wasn't so great, I would have probably docked a star but I would have been happy with just chili on the fries. I'm glad I got to experience first-hand how great this burger place does chili :)   I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Brooks is a nice little joint. Fast service. Polite people. I got the chili cheese fries and chili cheese bacon burger. It was good. My only complaint is that the beef could've been more seasoned but I would go again."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Carolina style burger for the $ in Charlotte.  Fries just ok.  Haven't tried anything else."}
{"text":"It is not that Brooks Sandwich House was bad, it just didn't live up to expectations. The food is cheap, it is tasty, but it isn't special. If no one told me I would not have guessed it to be one of the top ranked burgers in Charlotte.  Read more at: http://eatitcharlotte.com/2017/06/20/brooks-sandwich-house/"}
{"text":"First time at Brooks. I had two cheeseburgers and I have to say I am looking forward to bringing friends and family here. The cheeseburger \"All the way\" was fabulous!  Topped with a thick peppery chili, mustard and onions on a fresh steamed bun.   The second burger with more traditional toppings was great too. Funny little building where you walk in to order then eat outside or in you car.  Steady flow of customers at 1:30 on a Wednesday. I like the place!!!"}
{"text":"So you want a great burger and someone suggests Brooks. You go to this small building on a piece of dirt on the side of the new light rail. There is no place to sit. Just a wood stand up table under some trees.  So you order a burger and stand at a table and listen and get involved in the conversations around you. The burgers are amazing and the conversations are fantastic. A unique old time Charlotte experience"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great and gets even better when you have a hangover!!   Bacon Egg and Cheese on a roll (potato) is pretty freeking good!! Just the right amount of Bacon with just the right amount of Grease!! I have also had the Hot Dogs which also can do no wrong in my eyes!! Perfectly cooked with just the right amount of CRUNCH!! Burgers are great too!!   The interior is very small I have always taken my food to go, but they do have picnic tables outside. Do expect a crowd around early lunch time but not to worry the lines move quick! Only bummer about this place is the hours- wish they were open 24hrs just for those nights when you've been out drinking and all you really want is a Bacon Egg and Cheese!!! A girl just wants what she wants, when she wants it!!"}
{"text":"Charlotte institution. Fries are mediocre but the burgers are top notch. Make sure to get it with chili and bring cash."}
{"text":"Simple little spot, smells greasy when you walk in, the burgers taste delicious and are made to perfection. I loved my burger and so did my crew. I will definitely find my way back to this burger joint.  No complaints, only compliments! Keep it up, Sandwich House!"}
{"text":"Had the cheeseburger and also the BLT and both were very good. This is a small place so keep your eyes open or you'll miss it. Oh and they only take cash, so don't plan on paying with anything else. But on the plus side they have a ATM inside."}
{"text":"What a great little dive. It's so simple and perfect.  I was looking for something greasy to settle my hangover and Brooks didn't disappoint.  Got the burger all the way with chili, mustard and onions.  The chili really made this thing.  I thought it was seasoned better than the burger.  Tried ordering the chicken filet, but they were 89'd so I went with the fish sandwich.  I added tomato and lettuce with a side of tartar sauce, which put it all together.  I enjoyed this one as well.  This place has been around for a while and you can see and taste why.  Can't wait to stop in again and try their Carolina dog!"}
{"text":"It was pretty good food, but I wouldn't say the best in charlotte.  The 96 health inspection score was a little disturbing.  They definitely could improve the customer throughput.  Prices were comparable to other similar places."}
{"text":"Fresh patted burgers, very good hot dogs, excellent homemade chili, delicious slaw and very reasonable prices!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! Outside seating only. Breakfast & Lunch only. Only one! A Charlotte icon. Long line; quick service. One of the best burgers in the QC!"}
{"text":"I have little to say but to just do it. Breakfast egg n bacon . soft bun. Runny egg. Lunch the burger with chili n cheese extra chili. You can't go wrong. OK I have had two breakfast sandwiches. Only cause as soon as you leave off the gravel you want more. Trust me."}
{"text":"Brooks is that hole in the wall, off the beaten path Mecca.  There is no accidently finding it, you have to be going there.  It is a tiny  walk up counter, pretty smoky from the exhaust.  Simple breakfast items, burgers and dogs. Everything is wrapped in that heavenly white paper.  No tables and chairs, only one long table outside. A very fun visit to fulfill the chowhound in you. Brooks is one of those special places that you need to go at least once.  Cash only, closes 2p in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Brooks Sandwich House. You can throw all of the expected dopey descriptors in their direction, should you feel so equipped to do so -- \"A true, American classic!\" \"The BEST burger in all of Charlotte!\" \"A real staple, by golly!\" ......whatever. Pick your favorite.   My take? It's the shining star in a sea of dying breeds for truckers, blue collar, and white collar alike. It's the kind of place, on the local level, that you want to have memories of. You need to experience a burger wrapped in paper and eaten at the dirty, standing room-only, picnic tables. You need to experience the \"line\" during the lunch rush. It's a timeless favorite.   Would you know about Brooks from reading some hip, haute cuisine magazine? Absolutely not. You're either going to stumble across the reviews and hear about how it's a stellar burger stop with great fries or your friend's grandma's church member's daughter used to go when she was a kid and you have to try it.   It's a dive and it's utterly perfect. My only regret is that I didn't get my burger all-the-way -- chili, onions, and mustard. That sounds like heaven.   Do yourself and everyone else a favor and go have your own experience at Brooks."}
{"text":"Great 'all-the-way' burgers - and love to have lunch at Brooks whenever I need to head-on into the city. Sadly, there's only this one location in NoDa :-( but well worth a visit whenever I'm in the NoDa area. Try to get there by 11:30-ish and beat the lunch crowd - cuz it can get backed-up a bit during lunch hour with all the burger lovers in CLT."}
{"text":"Brooks is tiny, hidden and absolutely freakin' delicious.  For a mere $4.75 you too can enjoy a thick, tasty cheeseburger and a bag of substantial (both in length and girth) fries. Generally, I'm not a fry picker but by the time I got back to work I had picked away at least half my fries. Yes, they were a tad cold, but so what? The burgers were crisp on the outside and full of flavor. I love that they shred their lettuce and onions so you never end up with one little thin slice of lettuce or a bite that only tastes like onion.  The owners are super friendly, but in a way that doesn't slow the service. (You can't afford to when your waiting area is smaller than some closets.) Watch out waistline, there is a new choice on my regular lunch rotation and it's Brooks for burgers."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here. Staff treated my brother in-law with such disrespect. We will never be back here.  The staff raised their voice at him in front of other customers. In return we asked for our money back. He was discriminated against and the embarrassment of being disrespected in front of others will make assure we will never come back here again. I will be sure to tell all of my friends and family."}
{"text":"So there's this burger joint in a block house with metal bar windows, a gravel parking lot and it sits adjacent to a railroad yard. There's a standing room only outdoor eating area comprised of aged wood and rusty nails. There's beef, chili, American cheese slices, hot dogs and bologna inside. My kind of place!  Bottom line is the food is out of sight. Southern style all the way. Get a burger and don't by any means miss the wedge fries served in their paper pocket with grains of salt clinging on. Ranks up there with the top 3 fries I've had, lots of flaky potato flavor to go along with you chili, mustard and slaw. Place your order, pay with cash and get out of the way and outside so you can cozy up next to lawyers, sanitation workers, hobos and railroad track gangs alike. They all know what's good and where to find it.   These brothers have been doing the flat top gig for decades and the lot is always full at lunch for a reason. Get here!"}
{"text":"Ate at Brooks twice in my life time.  The first time, the burger was amazing.  The second time around, just now, I got home and my burger tasted like laundry detergent.  Had my boyfriend check to make sure it isn't just my imagination.  He smelled it as well. Disappointed!"}
{"text":"It was my first time eating here. I had a burger and fries. They cook the food as you order it. I thought it was going to take a while but it was pretty quick. The burger was greasy but good. They serve steak fries and they were fresh. It was crowded so that means people know about this place. I was very impressed with the food and I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"The building is a little worn down but the burgers are outstanding! Easy 5/5! Just remember to bring cash, they don't take card."}
{"text":"I did not like Brooks at all.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and fries.  I didn't think either were good.  The chicken was bland and the fries were worse.  The only reason this place didn't get a 1 star is because the price was really cheap.  I guess I should have expected it."}
{"text":"Don't come here expecting unlimited fries or towering burgers served with onion straws & guacamole, Brook's serves up affordable and flavorful burgers, hand pattied and packed with flavor from that 50 year old griddle!   Have it your way as long as your way is pretty darn basic but freaking awesome with Brooks famous chili, onion, mustard, and cheese, and oh yeah no freaking ketchup on the burger. The only thing worse than serving ketchup on a burger are the lines at Brooks Sandwich House because everyone knows where to get a great burger.  You wont need a second mortgage for a Brooks burger either, a Cheeseburger all the way will set you back less than $4.   Forget the Zack's \"Not So Special\", been there not impressed, frozen stamped patty of meat on a cold bun.   Food: 5 Sporks Service:  4 Sporks Atmosphere: 5 Sporks (love that parking lot) Local Beer: 0 Sporks (walk across the street to Heist Brewery) Value: 5 Sporks"}
{"text":"Old school,  good 'ol boy,  greasy dive with good food.   Think Price's Chicken Coop except they serve burgers, dogs and awesome breakfast sandwiches.  I generally order egg, cheese and livermush sandwich and when really dropping my guard top it with their homemade chili (why are the good things soooo very bad for you?).  Way under $5 with a large coffee.   Lots of local flair, interesting staff and strictly cash only.  Take out only (suggest you eat under the shade tree on the wooden trough.  You might make a friend,  too).  Closed on the weekends."}
{"text":"BEST Burger in Charlotte...The East Coast...The USA...The WORLD!  Seriously there burgers are amazing and the homemade chili is an absolute must add-on! Cash only, great prices, short hours- all perfect traits for a burger joint only known by Charlotte natives. If you're in the area or live in Charlotte or in the Carolinas for that matter, GO to BROOKS!"}
{"text":"I'm kicking myself now that I found this place because I've been working in NoDa for 4 years and could've been eating these burgers all along...better late than never I guess!   I instantly fell in love with Brooks because I love Hole-in-the-wall type places and this is definitely one of those. From my experience, when you take away all the unnecessary frills, you are left with something delicious and cheap, and that is really all that matters in life. I've had their chicken sandwich, fries, and burgers, and the burgers are by far the star. I always get them with cheese all the way, which includes mustard, onions, and their homemade chili for $3.50. One of the things I love most about their burgers, other than the taste, is the fact that although they do pack a large amount of chili in there, it is not a complete disaster when you eat it and you can actually safely eat them while driving! (layer some napkins on your lap for extra insurance!)  It sucks that we can't eat their burgers 24/7, but I respect the fact that they're a family owned business and need to take some time for themselves."}
{"text":"Best hole-n-the wall Burger joint I have tried.  This is not a place for the health conscious,  but it is a place for great burgers and dogs.  They even sale Bologna and liver mush sandwiches.  Takes me way back.  Must go place."}
{"text":"Simple and delicious!  Go early.  Bring a friend.  Bring cash.  Get the cheeseburger.  Get it all the way.  Stand outside.  Enjoy.  Gym tomorrow."}
{"text":"I can see why this place comes highly recommended. The burgers are juicy, the crust is crunch  and the char is just right. The chili is not a tomato based, but highly seasoned and worth getting on their fries. The fries are hand cut.  Even with the chili and cheese, the fries still came through. It is so good that I actually contemplate getting a third burger. Next time I get a day off I will return for another burger or two."}
{"text":"I consider myself a burger connoisseur of sorts... This was one of the first burger places I went to when I moved to Charlotte.  This place is very good. I got the Burger all the way with slaw. It was just solid and super affordable. I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Talk about a hole in the wall (but don't let that scare you away)! What this place lacks in amenities, they make up for in a very tasty burger. Is it a little greasy? Sure. Just be sure to jog 4 miles before lunch and you'll be fine. Also to note is they serve a good breakfast as well starting at 7am.  Be sure to check your watch before you go, they are not open for dinner and close at 3pm. They are also closed on Saturday & Sunday. Make sure you have real, paper currency as well. They have an ATM in the corner but the fee is scandalous!"}
{"text":"Finally  made it. Been on my \"to do\" list for years.  This place has always gotten excellent reviews on their Dogs, Burgers, and Sandwiches but I have never had an opportunity to try them. That is till today.  My problem is that they are only open 7 am to 3 pm, Monday through Friday and closed on weekends.  Not normally in Charlotte at these times and if I am, I'm on a tight schedule and with little reason to be in the same area as the restaurant.  Then we have today.  Had Hip Replacement Surgery on Wednesday and was discharged at around 1 pm. Elizabeth to NoDa is not that far so off we went.  Found out real quick there were some street closures and detours because of the Blue Line Lynx extension so pay attention and pay attention to signs.  Since I am on a walker and crutches, my wife went up to the window and ordered lunch. Not completely sure what she had but I had the Chili Dog and the Basic Cheeseburger.  Both were delicious.  The dog was plump and juicy and Chili full of meat and great flavor. By full of meat, I mean not as runny as most commercial chili you tend to get out of a can and they type that other dog places try to imitate  People like to think of a Gourmet Burger or Cheeseburger in terms of all the exotic things that can be added. They can be good but get away from what a Gourmet Cheeseburger Burger should be.  A Gourmet Cheeseburger should be as simple as possible with a good fresh pattie cooked properly and neither dry or greasy. Cheese should something that compliments the meat and does not distract, Then of course, you have you have the other topping of lettuce and tomatoes which should be a fresh as possible and tomatoes should be properly ripe. Bun should be fresh and condiments should be used sparingly to avoid overwhelming the simple tastes that each component contributes. Mayonnaise is good and a very mild mustard used sparingly are good choices.  Final potential topping is the onion. Some people like them, some don't. I like a slice of a good sweet onion to add a bit of texture to the burger so long as it's of the sweet type.  Brooks pulled it off.  The Chili Dog and the Cheeseburger were both worth their reputation and if I was to name a favorite, it would be the Cheeseburger.  Take note that the roads are messed up with Blue Line Extension but good news is that they are now only short walking distance to one of the stations"}
{"text":"The best burger I have ever had... seriously good! There is a reason there is a long line outside of the door at this very unassuming little shack."}
{"text":"This place is A1. Wowzers. I decided to cheat on my Pescatarian diet for the beginning of Fall (sounds better than I felt like eating a sloppy burger) and ended up here after asking Yelp for help!! THANK GOD I DID!! I got a cheeseburger \"with everything\" & a fry. AMAZING. Gives 5 Guys or any other favorite a run for it's money. FOR SURE!! Closes @3p & you need cash which are 2 green lights to go. ANYWHERE that only takes cash & only stays open for lunch is Yelper for \"GREAT FOOD IS MADE HERE\"... Amen."}
{"text":"Had to try it since I've heard so many good things. MMM MMM. First, it's cheap. Cash only. I got a double burger all the way (chili, cheese, onions, mustard), fries and a drink. Came to be about 7.50. Don't judge me on the double either.. I'm pregnant and I ate the entire thing!!  So good. Really homemade, juicy, flavorful. I thought it would be overwhelmingly full of chili but it wasn't, the chili was like a condiment and it was the perfect amount. Even if you don't like chili on a burger i would recommend you try this one! Also the fries were great and the line was extremely fast and efficient. Obviously it's not healthy, but that's not why you're here.  ALSO...plenty of parking which I was surprised about!"}
{"text":"This is an absolutely wonderful place to experience down home, homemade, american burgers.  The meat is actually - meat!  It is incredible and instead of fries, they serve very thick, fresh, steamy wedges.  If you are ever in Charlotte, this is the place to drop by (bring a napkin!)."}
{"text":"It's super cheap, it's relatively fast, and you can't walk out without smelling like meat and grease. These are all the requirements I never knew I needed from a burger place. It is literally a shack, and as soon as you walk in you're smoked out by the busy grill, but you don't even care, because you know you're smelling what's about to come. And you bet I enjoyed every bite of what's about to come. On top of that, I actually enjoyed standing outside at the table and eating alongside some strangers (whom I ended up getting to know). My mom and I got the fish filet sandwich, burger all the way, a burger with lettuce/tomato/slaw, and a liverwurst sandwich. She threw in cheese fries with her burger and I threw in hashbrowns with mine. THE HASHBROWN DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Everyone, PLEASE get the hashbrown. It's crispy, it's hot, and it's soft on the inside--exactly what you want out of your McDonald's hashbrown order but never get. My one gripe is that whenever I get a burger all the way, I really want coleslaw as well, so I was mildly disappointed that theirs doesn't have coleslaw. But since I can easily add it next time, I know it's gonna be outta this world. I've never been so excited about a burger place before."}
{"text":"Normally I wouldn't wait 30 mins in the cold for a burger.. I just wouldn't do it and go elsewhere. But too many loyal regulars have made me want to see what the hype is about! So glad I stayed out in the cold. It was worth every single bite! Will be returning very soon!!"}
{"text":"The best burger I've had in Charlotte. Definitely would recommend the cheeseburger all the way. Great value."}
{"text":"I just got back to Charlotte two days ago and was excited that I was about 2 miles from Shake Shack but then I remembered... BROOKS! So I had to drive aaaallll the way to the other side of town but it's always worth it. The only thing missing is offering hot chili peppers or peperoncinis.  Cheeseburger ATW, please!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint in charlotte. Sometimes can be a wait but I promise y'all it's worth the wait. Cheese burgers all the way with fries and a sweet tea. So dank!"}
{"text":"delicious burgers! wish they opened on weekends, very difficult to get to otherwise. SO and I planned to grab lunch here after a weekday flight when we both had taken time off work. SOO good! Cash Only & prepare to wait if you go during lunch hours"}
{"text":"I had wanted to try this place for a while as I've seen all the accolades for their food. I knew before hand about the restaurant being cash only, so that was okay. Between my boyfriend and myself, we got two burgers, a hotdog, and chili-cheese fries. My boyfriend described the chili as chopped pepper steak ... it looked like chopped meat and I did taste the spicy, peppery-ness of it, but it wasn't in a sauce or tomato based like I expect most chili to be. It was very tasty, nonetheless.  The burgers and hotdog were also good.   Food was an A+. The wait was a D-. Since the restaurant is only open from 7am to 3pm during the week (not open on weekdays), if you are going for lunch, you have to take time out of your workday.  For 4 food items, we waited almost 30 minutes.  I don't know if when we got there if the day was atypical or not, but they do note on their website that for call in orders, expect 20 to 25 minutes. There is no seating, so be prepared to stand.  I think the food was really good, maybe even better than other burger places in Charlotte, but given the long wait, it would probably be better to call in ahead of time and pick up your food so you don't have to wait as long standing outside."}
{"text":"All the things are true. Just go and check it out.   For less than $5 I walked out with a cheeseburger all the way (onion, chili, & mustard) and a sweet tea.   Cash ONLY."}
{"text":"The menu is simple and it's a hole in the wall, but it really might be the best burger in the city. Gotta try it all the way your first time (chili, mustard, onions). Cash only I believe so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"First things first CASH ONLY, learned that the hard way and had to eat the ATM fee they had there.  I will say I was extremely surprised by Brooks even though it was recommended to me by so many people I went in not expecting much.  However, their burgers are delicious!  They are not super premium steak burgers or anything, but you can tell they pay attention to the details because they are classic burgers done right, and with lots of extras if you want.  They use a coney style chili for their burgers and it was really good and I can be had to impress in that growing up in the greater Detroit area.  Their fries are seasoned well too."}
{"text":"This review is only based on one visit, but I think its safe to say i'm a fan. Finally visited the red sandwich house, after driving by it a couple of times always wondering why all those people were outside! With very limited hours it took me a while to get down here, as I don't work in the area, but thankfully a day off during the week enabled me to grab a bite!  Very small little 1 room \"house\". No frills, what you see is what you get. They have a flat top, deep-fryer, toaster oven to warm buns, a few heat lamps to keep fries hot, and that's about it. Walk in (if there is room), place your order, wait a few mins, pay and leave happy. Very basic food, burgers, dogs, sandwiches, and some good breakfast stuff from the looks of it as well.  I had a bacon cheeseburger, and it was great. Perfectly juicy, with that little bit of flat-top crustiness. And to top it off, its all super cheap. Can't wait to get back for another burger!"}
{"text":"Stopped by Brooks on a recent visit to Charlotte to renew my long love affair with this great Charlotte eatery.  The area I now live in has their share of good, old school burger joints, but not the awesome divey-ness of Brooks.  And the great prices are just the bonus to the tasty food.  Not much to say that other reviewers haven't said so well.  Just go, and bask in the glow of a fried bologna sandwich with all the trimmings or a loaded chili burger.  Adding chili to everything is the law here....it's a perfect topping for most every sandwich they offer.  My only wish would be to clone Brooks and drop it in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"THE BEST CAROLINA CLASSIC BURGER ON PLANET EARTH!   - Ridiculously small restaurant: SRO. - Take-out only.  - CASH ONLY.   - Hours: PLEASE NOTE: Brooks is only open from 7:30 AM until 2:00 PM. They lock the door at 1:00 PM, but the tiny take out window, to the left of the entrance is open until 2 o'clock PM. I found this out the hard way.....  - Seating: There are no seats inside or outside the restaurant. There are elevated communal wooden tables in the shade of trees.   - Parking: There is a generous amount of parking in their gravel lot.   - Conclusion: Their ATW burgers are SERIOUSLY good!   - PS: One time, after returning back to work, I took a ruler and measured the thickness of the hamburger patties, AFTER being cooked. One burger was fully one inch thick and the other burger was 7/8\" - amazing.   - PSS: Ordering their burger \"all the way,\" is the ONLY way to get the maximum goodness of mustard, chili, and onion atop their THICK, hand formed, never frozen, hamburger patties.   - PSSS: If Brooks would put CHILI CHEESE FRIES on their menu, they would make a fortune. Their fries are normally super crispy, skin on, and salty. Their homemade chili is out of this world. Top this with a liberal application of Velveeta  or Cheese Whiz melted cheese. You could sell these for $3 per container, as fast as you could make them."}
{"text":"This is where you get to go when you die and are a good person. This is also where you get to go for lunch of you are willing to stand in the line and have CASH. Be patient. It's worth it. This burger (don't F it up - get it all the way with slaw like a real American) is a religious experience. Do you hear me? This is like way beyond Jesus on toast - get that out of your mind. I would be so happy to sit on the ledge outside every day in the rain and eat this burger. If you said, \"hey Amber, High end steak house or Brooks for lunch today?\" I would be all over that plain white bag. Warning: you can only eat Brooks like once a week tops. It will kill you. But that might not be a bad thing as it is truly heaven on earth.... for $5. Seriously tho.... do this."}
{"text":"Insane wait but every bite was worth it.  Ask for the burger all the way and get the fries. Burgers aren't huge so you'll want them."}
{"text":"Be sure to take cash!  This place is definitely worth a visit or 2 or 3! Burgers, dogs, and fries are all good! I wish they were open on weekends!"}
{"text":"And finally it was my turn to try this place.  As soon as I entered I recalled that I had actually been here before but it was years ago and I think actually ran by a different set of owners....not sure though.  I had the bacon cheeseburger and it was mouthwatering good.  I loved every bite of it.  To rank this the number one burger joint in the area isn't a large stretch but I have to say it's a different kind of burger, yes delicious, but not creative, etc.  Meh, that's fine with me but just so you know.    Standing room only and cash only!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this little hole in the wall sandwich shop!! I can tell its a family-owned business and they are always very pleasant when I come through no matter if its breakfast or lunch! If you need a grease fix this is the place to be :)"}
{"text":"neighbor and I go here once a month.  cheeseburger all the way, stand outside to eat at the table.  good food, fun place especially when nice outside."}
{"text":"Small place only opened M-F 7am-2pm...But what a great burger, order to go. The people are great and the food is awesome. One of the best burgers I have ever had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"If you like $10 hamburgers then stop reading now! If you are a health food nut, move on. If you like really good burgers and dogs with the best chili I have ever tasted, this is the place. This place is literally a hole in the wall, but you will find people from all walks of life standing in line. Their chili is one of a kind. It is very dry, not tomato based, lots of black pepper, very unique and delicious. They also serve breakfast, not bad but lunch is better."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place that hasn't already been said... I can't believe it took me 30+ years living in Charlotte to finally visit for the tastiest, messiest, grilled to perfection and topped with the perfect trinity -- cheese, onions & chili -- burger joint in town! Go on a gorgeous fall (or spring) day and eat outside next to bankers, city workers and everyone in between. A perfect burger and fries will only set you back about $5 and I promise, you won't be disappointed!   I'll join the masses and selfishly state that I wish they were open on the weekend/evenings."}
{"text":"Best Cheeseburger I've ever ate! My favorite little place. It doesn't get better than this! I don't care where you go. From upscale to diners they got them all beat!"}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre burgers and previously frozen french fries.  Ok for a quick stop and on par with some fast food chains.  Would never call it the \"Best Burger in Charlotte\"."}
{"text":"Hands down best chili burger in Charlotte. Great mix of people and the owners are great."}
{"text":"You really can't beat the price at Brooks. It is definitely a unique experience for any burger lover. Grab your cash (cash only) and make sure it's the middle of the afternoon on a weekday (limited operating hours) and call your order in ahead of time if you don't want to wait too long.   Brooks is a teeny tiny little spot - once you enter it almost reminds you of a under-the-tent church cookout or something along those lines. You will be squeezed in with a bunch of hungry patrons and be prepared to eat outside or take it to go as there is zero room to eat inside.   Now all of these stipulations to eating do not in fact make the experience more aggravating- in fact, it is quite the opposite. You can't help but feel the excitement in the air, and perhaps a bit of drool on your arm thanks to the guy smushed next to you. Regardless, your burger will be juicy, tasty, and cheap!  I recommend the cheeseburger all the way (onions, mustard, and chili)!"}
{"text":"You really have to make it a point to find your way to Brooks. You will not pass it on your way somewhere else, as this little road goes almost nowhere else - and those places it does lead are generally much simpler to get to if you take the more easily traveled routes. Perhaps Robert Frost was inspired by Brooks when he wrote about the diverging roads in his famous poem, but we may never know.  Whatever the case, if you do find yourself here, by chance or on purpose, the small cinder block building has only one way in and one way out - and it is quite possible there will be a line during the small window of opening hours (none of which happen during dinner, so don't get your hopes up).  Those who like an open kitchen are in luck, because you can see everything that goes on here - just look over the counter and you can see the grill as your food is prepared, plated (well, bagged) and served to you, and you can step out. There is not really any place in-house to eat, but you can pull up a picnic table outside to partake if that is your style. Like other to-go establishments, you likely won't get the same experience if you are going far to eat, so it's probably worth doing so. The other option is eating in your car, but if you try that, you might need to look up dry cleaners as well. Maybe auto detailing too."}
{"text":"National hot dog day up in heeuh.  Great burger & dog.  Would've added more onion, pickle and mustard but it was pretty awesome as is.  Nowhere to stand when packed and I don't think there was anywhere to wash your hands afterwards so you need to bring your A game to tackle the carolina style goods."}
{"text":"A solid burger and fries at a decent price and nothing more here in my opinion.  I stopped in at around 11:30 hoping to be a little before the lunch rush (if there is any at Brooks- I'm not really sure), and I ordered the cheeseburger all the way combo with fries. I have to say that I was surprised at the location to begin with- I didn't expect a lot, but I didn't realize it's essentially a shack with no place to sit and eat (and barely enough space to stand in line). Despite only ordering a burger and fries, it took 8-10 minutes for the food to get done even though only 2 other orders were ahead of me, so I would recommend ordering ahead.  As for the burger, it was good but not great. It came with standard bun, pretty high quality beef patty, a slice of unheated American cheese, some chili, and LOTS of onions and mustard. I'm glad I really like mustard or it may have been too much, and the plethora of raw onions wasn't ideal but also wasn't bad. I would've prefer the onions grilled but they were still decent on the sandwich. The chili added no real flavor, however, and honestly I wouldn't have been able to distinguish it taste-wise from the beef patty. The single cheese slice was lost with all the onions and mustard and didn't provide much flavor either. Overall, it was a good, greasy burger for only $3.75 and was definitely a step up from fast food burgers. For a fairly long wait time (or the inconvenience of having to order ahead) I would probably rather go to a Five Guys and pay slightly more for a larger burger where I can get the toppings I want."}
{"text":"Please consider this an apology to all the vegetarians and vegans around the world...sorry...but...  I love bacon. Crispy bacon with the perfect amount of salt and crunch...but not too crunchy of course. Oh, and a touch of grease please. Now, I don't eat bacon too often but for some reason I had an insane hankering for a BLT the other day when I was driving around NoDa. And then the light bulb flickered in my little head...Brooks...Sandwich...House.   This unassuming little house is simple - a counter, a few friendly employees and cash only. I ordered my BLT, paid the $3 and change and went on my merry way. The bacon was cooked to perfection and the sandwich was the exact no frills option I was seeking. And hey, those breakfast sandwiches look pretty delightful, too.   Now I'll need to make my way back here (very soon) to dive into a burger...I hear they're fantastic...thanks, Brooks!"}
{"text":"Don't shoot me but I didn't get the cheeseburger \"ALL THE WAY\" which includes chili. I am cheese, onions and ketchup all the way. It is a 1/3 lb burger and while they do have a tempting double I went single. The onion are chopped and raw and delicious. The american cheese gooey and binds it all together. Burger was well done but juicy and worth savoring.   I love the wedge fries which you don't see everywhere but what I especially liked is that they were thin wedges with crispy edges. Perfect and as much a reason to come here as any. Of course it is cash only and there is a large picnic tablet to sit at but that is it. Only open until 2. Order, wait for your number, pick up and pay."}
{"text":"Chili burger or chili dog?! The struggle is very real my friends. My advice: just go ahead and get both.   I first discovered Brooks Sandwich House a few years ago here on Yelp. It's nothing fancy, just a little stand alone building over by Heist in NoDa. This little hidden gem has been cranking out deliciousness for more than 40 years.   I love the chili. So, my orders always consist of things smothered in that homemade goodness. A cheeseburger or hot dog all the way... either makes any day better. Order both and it makes the day A LOT better. Might as well get some chili cheese fries while you're at it. They also have options like bologna, livermush, and bbq (when available) on the menu. One day, I will be brave and try livermush. My friend Eddie swears by it.   Note: Brooks is open Monday-Friday (no weekends) for breakfast and lunch. It is cash only, so plan accordingly. The place is small, so there is no indoor seating. Place your order, wait for your number to be called, then go pay. There are some outdoor seats if the weather is nice."}
{"text":"There's a reason why this place has been voted Charlotte's best burger year after year. No frills. No board telling you where your fries came from. No secret menu. Just a counter and great burgers served up Carolina style (chili, mustard, onions). The prices are amazing and you can't beat the taste. Don't worry about finding a seat because Brooks is take out only. There are some picnic areas to eat outside, but you will find many patrons taking in the great taste of the real Brooks brothers in their car. Don't miss one of Charlotte's best greasy landmarks.  Biggest tip is that it is cash only. If you didn't make a trip to the ATM machine, there is one in the ordering area."}
{"text":"I've tried a total of five times to enjoy brooks and I just can't. There is far better chili cheese burgers in the city. This place gets a lot of hype and has a loyal following to each there own but I just don't get it. The chili isn't amazing the burger was tough and 3/5 times I've come they are out of fries or bacon I personally think the diamond right around the corner has a all around better burger"}
{"text":"I absolutely love their hamburgers and hot dogs. They only take cash so be prepared. The line is always long but the wait isn't too bad. It's no inside seating."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time, but they're only open during the week until  about 3 pm. I finally got around to coming though. They serve some really solid burgers here and at a good price. You have to order them all the way with chili, onions and mustard.   I ordered a side of chili cheese fries which disappointed me (at least for the size and the price ratio).   But as far the burgers go - they're bomb. Try them."}
{"text":"Great burger especially for the price. They load it with chili and it's the bomb. Only negative is they only take cash but it's one of the best burgers in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Classic, must visit spot for a cheap lunch! Don't change a thing....just order straight from the menu. These guys have perfected it all :)"}
{"text":"Its the best cheap eats in Charlotte!!! Delicious and super simple...awesome burger, unbelievable chili and must-get fries!!! Try to call it in around 11 am or so because during lunch time their phone is off..its best to do that so you are not waiting for an hour  but its worth the wait nonetheless. Keep in mind, its a shack with no proper ventilation so you would habe either wait in your car or outside (no sitting).   I wish they would open on weekends...as their hours are Mon to Fri 7 am to 3 pm (what a working schedule)  But people! This is definitely a must try.."}
{"text":"So per Yelp's suggestion, I came here as a last supper...before starting my vegan diet that get swimsuit ready and boy was it worth it.  I ordered the cheeseburger and hot dog all the way, fries and a sweet tea. In less than 5 minutes my order was up.   Being ravenously hungry, I dug right in.   I tackled the hot dog first. The chili was absolutely divine. I mean so good that you could slather it on cardboard and it would taste delicious. The hot dog wasn't your typical North Carolina red dog (which I genuinely love). It was an elevated meaty dog with a nice rich, beefy, sausage flavor.   The cheeseburger was amazing. Again the chili was the star but the beef was clearly a fresh patty, the cheese was perfectly melted. It was amazing.   The fresh cut wedge fries were perfectly seasoned with seasoned salt and crispy.   All in all a deliciously craveable experience and that you won't regret."}
{"text":"Cash only! I like to note that for people, since I usually travel without cash. ...Yep, this place rocks. The burgers are simply phenomenal for the price!!! And the girls inside are helpful and friendly. I went at lunch, and it was pretty packed, but I still had my food in a hurry."}
{"text":"What a great Charlotte landmark, the burger was pretty good but the hot dog was really good, it was the chili, fries were pretty tasty, the staff are extremely friendly, just wish they would clean the place up and the parking lot pick up some trash, probably a 2 1/2 star, but I would recommend the place"}
{"text":"I am not a food snob-really. Beer, yes; food...I'll slum it. Brooks is the best, bar NONE, burger joint I have been to since I left NYS 9 years ago. Yee-HAW! A friend brought me there to experience what he called a regular meal-stop over the course of 30 years, and so I could share it with my other half on his next visit- and we SHALL go here again!!! Service was friendly and social. Burgers were awesome. Atmosphere brought back fond memories of home- for those of you from the Hudson River Valley in NYS- think Red Rooster in Brewster, but BETTER, albeit no miniature golf! Brooks is basically a walk-up version of a drive-through, except the food is far better. No cardboard patty served on a cardboard bun here!!! Sides are great and the chili??  Oh.My.GAWD! Gonna eat here more."}
{"text":"Best burger in Charlotte! No where to sit except outside picnic tables, but the burger and chili are dynamite."}
{"text":"Ok...this is not my place.  I have been here twice and really have never liked anything.  I know, it's almost 5 stars..but this is just my opinion.  I will say, everyone I know has enjoyed it, from breakfast sandwiches to burgers.  I just didn't fall in love.  It's not open on weekends, so you have to plan accordingly.  The shop is tiny inside and you order your food to go.  It is clean inside.  The staff is nice and the orders come out quickly.  Just not my taste. And that's ok.  I haven't a bad experience otherwise, and have heard many great things."}
{"text":"Always packed but who cares. The burgers and dogs are great. Type of place you can recommend to anyone and look like a genius."}
{"text":"This place is such a little burger shack, it's amazing and I love it! I'm actually a little bummed that I've lived in Charlotte for 3 years and my first trip was yesterday. It's just a perfectly delicious (and unbelievably messy) burger. There's no frills to it, but it's a delicious, juicy burger and the chili is a simple, classic recipe.   It is cash only, and there are no seats inside (barely any room inside) but find a spot at the picnic table, get into a hunched stance (so you don't get delicious chili on you) and make some new friends!"}
{"text":"This place serves up an excellent burger, and equally excellent hot dog, and the FFs are no slouch either. This is a takeout only, hole in the wall place, kind of buried on a side street in a Charlotte neighborhood off North Davidson.  We tried 2 cheeseburgers ($3.50 each), one with L,T, & Mayo, and one ATW with M, C, & O. Both were out of sight good, but the ATW burger was a little better - as good a diner style burger as you're gonna find in the state - up there with PB's in Winston, Char-Grill in Raleigh, and Wimpy's in Durham.  The Hot Dog ($2.00) is also as good as it gets in a classic Southern Chili dog - great tasting, meaty chili, decent wiener, and a good bun. This is as good as Green's here in Charlotte, and just a smidge behind PB's. The FFs ($2) were very, very good. Will definitely try the Chili Cheese Fries next time (they go foe $3.75)  The have barbecue on the menu, but just in the fall, I was told. Darn!  These are world class burgers and hot dogs, and at these prices, they are beyond a value meal. Not coming back is not an option"}
{"text":"Delicious burgers and fries for a great price. A must stop if you are visiting Charlotte"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to check out Brooks last week. Wow! Not only can I not believe I've never been here but I'm surprised that I'd never even heard of this place until recently (That statement makes me sound like I should know everything and I don't...not even close, but still.). As others have said, it's not a place that you will just casually pass by. You have to know where you're going to find it. Glad I did. I got the chili cheeseburger w/ fries and a Cheerwine. Not only tasty but filling. Yes, I would say they have some really good burgers but more importantly I would say that this is a place people have to experience just to say they did. It's a throw back to simpler times where you find extremely loyal customers clamoring to a local tradition. Consider me apart of that now!"}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious. Nothing fancy here but I find the best things in life aren't super fancy so it works for me. My husband kept wanting to eat here weeks before our wedding but I refused (while delicious, the food isn't on anyone's pre-wedding diet) so the day after we got back from our honeymoon we stopped here for lunch. It was after two so the window was open but the inside ordering counter wasn't. The fryer stops at 2 pm so no fries (although I've had them before and they're good) but we each got a burger and a soda. Tasty, fresh and comforting! This is a great, local spot that everyone should visit."}
{"text":"After a write up in the Charlotte Agenda naming Brooks as one of the places every Charlottean should try, I was intrigued and immediately put it on my list.  I opted for a regular cheese burger (ketchup and mayo) only and an order of fries.  The burger was juicy but otherwise no frills.  Their fries are wedge cut fries that were fresh and delicious.  A couple of things to note:  they are CASH only.  It is basically a walk up counter to order.  They do not have seating.  There is a large communal table under the protection of a pavilion.  Many were eating in their cars.  There is ample parking.  They are only open Mon-Fri until 3:00 pm.  All in all it was a cheap, quick lunch and I am glad I have finally dined at this local landmark; however, I do not see me having cravings for a Brooks burger."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place is REEEEEAAALLLL good.   \"Cheeseburger all the way and an order of fries\" is all you need to utter to the girl at the counter to make the future of your day look brighter. If burgers could snuggle I would want to cuddle up to this one and never let it go (until I ate it all I guess). It should be noted that the fries are actually potato wedges which I don't normally get down with too much but there is something special about the ones at Brooks that makes them doubly delish.   Do your taste buds a favor, bring a wad of Washingtons, show up early and show up often."}
{"text":"If you want a great burger with no hype, this is your place. A little hard to find but you will remember the address after your first visit. Great burger, good price , fast service. If you show up and see nothing but Construction and work trucks, you know that it is a good spot to eat lunch."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick delicious burger and cold drink at a very reasonable price, check out this NoDa gem located off of Davidson. Definitely a local delight based on its location, decor & size it's easily missed (looks like an abandoned building after hours).   This little gem produces some good eats and has a very basic menu but quick and friendly service. All burgers are made well done so no special orders but the burgers are delicious. I have an extreme sensitivity to sweets so I normally do not order sweet tea from any where but a customer told me it's a perfect balance of tea & sweet and by the old Gods and new (Game of Thrones reference ) it was delicious and I didn't need to dilute with water so thank you Brooks.  I highly recommend Brooks for anyone who can get there between the hours of 9am-2pm (they serve breakfast) but the grill shuts down promptly at 2pm so get there on time you won't be disappointed.  P.S. You get a little ticket after ordering, your pickup number is after the dash  & you pay when picking up the order not ordering."}
{"text":"Don't expect a fancy-schmancy burger place.  It's literally a one-room house, with no sitting.  You can eat at the counter inside, or stand at the not-quite-tall-enough-to-be-a-counter outside under the shelter.  Simple burgers, and price includes all the way (mustard, onions and chili), with small change for extra toppings.  Two thumbs."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to write this post as I didn't want to share my secret of the best burgers in Charlotte.  The ONLY downfall to this place (which I can respect) is they are only daytime hours m-f.  You know you are about to get some decent food when you roll up to a cinderblock building and construction workers and uptown bankers are all gathered around outside to get one of Charlotte's best kept secrets.  There are no seats or bathrooms in this place, but there are stand up tables to eat outside.  Bring cash as cards are not accepted.  Oh, and my insider tip- double patty bacon cheese burger with a slab of fried bologna on top.  BOOM!  The chili burger is AMAZING too!"}
{"text":"The burgers, hot dogs, and fried bologna are all awesome.  The fries are lacking, but I just get the main menu items because most of them cost about the same price as the fries so that works out nicely.  The service is also awesome and the fact that it is owned and run by the family (brothers and sister) makes it even better.  Sadly they are only open on the week days so I don't get to eat here often, but when I do it is always a treat."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!!  I was looking for an unusual and unforgettable lunch experience while I'm in NC for 36 hours...this place is IT! Fresh ingredients and incredible flavors!! The place is a little hole in the wall and the people are all about southern hospitality. My new favorite place in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Wow! Awesome burgers and fries! This place is the apitome of a dive with amazing food.  Some important points: cash only, no seating  (just order, pick up and go), but there is an outdoor table. The burger should ONLY be ordered ALL THE WAY; it's worth it trust me!"}
{"text":"Ordered burger all the way (with chili, mustard, cheese, onions), drink, and fries.   The burger was great for it's price. THERE IS NO WOW FACTOR about the burger, it just taste good. Its done right. Its simply the classic american smashburger. I recommend going there with friends, enjoy the atmosphere, and avoid lunch hour.   Also BRING CASH"}
{"text":"You know how long I've been wanting to try this place?!  LONG OVERDUE!  Finally I got to try the famous Brooks burger last week for lunch. My $3.50 cheeseburger all-the-way (onion, chili & mustard, I asked for slaw on top of it at no extra charge) was well worth every penny. The single pattie was grilled to a slight crisp on the outside but retained a good balance of juicy meat flavor with a hint of seasoning. Everything else added on made it a filling portion (at least for me). The menu board was short and sweet, the only side item was fries basically... which wasn't anything special.  The whole eating under the outdoor hut/shed structure standing up along a wood slab table with everyone added to the experience. There will be many Brooks lunch outing in the future... I may have to give other items a try.  Tips to eating at Brooks: 1.Don't wear white... or anything light color, especially if you doing all the way southern style. 2. Lettuce and tomato cost extra, but seriously, stick with chili and onion and slaw... you're in the South, enjoy the perk 3. May not be a bad idea to bring some wet naps 4. As you may know already, CASH only, so bring them"}
{"text":"David & Scott have an awesome restaurant and they have been there for may years. I had the burger with chilli and it was the best I have ever had.

{"text":"This. Place.  I can't believe I've lived in Charlotte for 5 years and somehow hadn't wandered over to Brooks'. It's perfect casual location for a take-out lunch with friends.  I looked on Yelp to make sure we were all talking about the same place. Greasy, happy food in paper bags-cash only. Yep, that's the one.  We arrived and I was immediately overcome with the aroma of sizzling beef. Vegetarian or not, you can't argue with that smell. It's divine.  One of my dining partners, a MD, is a regular, and I heard shouts of, \"Hey, Doc!\" and realized the owners have a personal relationship with their customers. Something I truly appreciate.  Having perused the menu ahead of time, I found that there aren't really any overt vegetarian options, but I didn't let that dampen my enthusiasm. I opted for an off-the-menu grilled cheese with tomato. No balking by the staff, and I think my sandwich was sublime. Coupled with fresh, nicely salted fries and a canned soft drink, it left nothing to be desired.  What I appreciated about the grilled cheese is that it was served on a hamburger bun, but was pressed almost like a cuban sandwich...so the edges were crisp and held up well to the potentially soggy tomato situation.  Once we received our orders, labeled in small paper bags, it was out to the covered, long, standing picnic table just outside the door. I love the communal dining aspect of the experience and the opportunity it afforded to enjoy a lunch while standing and chatting with my friends.  One of the twin brothers stepped outside to share a joke with our party. Super southern, super kind.   They're open for breakfast and lunch, Monday through Friday, and appear to have a large, fiercely loyal following. Apparently their chili is a big deal.   So go try Brooks'. Take along a few friends, a $20 and some TUMS.   You'll leave happy."}
{"text":"If your looking for a super cheap breakfast or lunch this is the place. It's take out only but they have bar height tables outside you can stand at to eat. Their burgers are super greasy but in a good way. They could use a bit of upkeep on the property to make it more ascetically pleasing. Just know this place is a dive with dive food and dive ambiance. Totally scrummy to have a juicy burger at 10am for $3.50"}
{"text":"I've had Brooks bookmarked for quite some time after seeing it profiled on some Food Network or Travel Channel show on great burgers and finally found myself in the area and hungry.  The building is small and all orders are to go where you can eat them standing up at wooden tables outside if you want to stay on premises.  Not sure how long Brooks has been around but there was a sign inside thanking customers for 40 years of support.  Thing is, the sign looked like it had been there for 40 years so lets just say, they've had staying power!  It's a very limited menu with mainly burgers and dogs and they do serve breakfast sandwiches in the morning.  Liver mush and egg sammie anyone??  I got the burger I saw on the show which was a cheeseburger ATW which at Brooks means chili, mustard, slaw and chopped onions.  The burger was a fat patty of clearly fresh beef and the sandwich as a whole was outstanding.  Best burger ever?  No, I make those at home but, still damn good and really cheap.    This is clearly one of those local institution type joints and I have a special place in my heart for mom and for pop.  Am very glad I came to Brooks!"}
{"text":"It's the type of joint you really root for. You want them to succeed and don't want them to sell out.   Ordered the cheeseburger \"all the way,\" (w/chili) fries and a sweet tea (anytime Uncle Si has one in his hand, I just crave it). I think we both agreed that the burger could have been seasoned a bit more, even with the chili. The fries were ok. The value, though, was GREAT.   I would bring some handwipes with you if you eat in your car like we did.   The staff is really nice and friendly, huge plus!"}
{"text":"I found this place because of their ranking as the best burger in Charlotte. I do need to say that it is a great burger, but it's a great burger because of it's bare-bone, quick service attributes.  I personally love this place; however, I do have to point out that the hours they are open makes it very difficult to partake in this phenomenal burger."}
