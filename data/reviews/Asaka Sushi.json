{"text":"Really good quality sushi for a great price! Found this gem yesterday and went for dinner on a Wednesday evening and was very pleased.  You have the option of AYCE or a la carte with a large menu and lots of options. Prices are really decent- $22 for AYCE and individual items for a la carte are cheap. Quality of the food is really great! The sashimi was very fresh, noodles were done well and flavourful, rolls were tasty. I ordered the Lakeshore Roll which has BBQ eel, tobiko & cucumber topped with avocado- it was delicious! My ONLY complaint was that the rolls were a bit on the smaller side (but you get a fair quantity) and the one piece of shrimp tempura I had wasn't as crispy as I like but I think that was luck of the draw because my crab tempura turned out great.

Atmosphere was cozy and quiet. It's located in an old plaza so it doesn't look like much on the outside, but the inside is modern and clean. Servers were super friendly and we didn't have to wait too long for the food to come out. They also do delivery in a pretty wide-range."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place just for their food this is a great place for good quality sushi, bento boxes and large portions for decent prices. However, if you're looking for a social outing or a place for a date avoid this place! I got a bento box which came with sashimi and bbq spare ribs which were very good. The decor in the restaurant was nice but there was absolute silence in the restaurant with only one other couple in the whole place. It was very awkward sitting there in silence trying to whisper. There was no music playing because the waitress didn't know how to turn it on. When she finally got it on it was very quiet and outdated music. The waitress herself looked very depressed and it was awkward speaking to her when she came to check on us. Absolutely no personal it whatsoever.  This place has so much potential but it needs more ambience and happier staff. Everything was very dark inside and I left wanting to never go back."}
{"text":"Wow! Thrilled this spot opened up. I had the all u can eat deal, freshly made, great quality of fish, especially for an all u can eat. The butter fish sashimi melted in my mouth, been a long time since I enjoyed a sushi meal like this. The menu an enormous selection of traditional and noveau menu items. Nice presentation, overall great little spot for a great price :)"}
{"text":"As a sushi lover, I was excited to try this place. I was so not impressed by the quality of the food. The way the rolls were made to the quality of the fish, this place did not impress us. I guess being a AYCE sushi place, we should have set the right expectations. I will not be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Service was very good - attentive. Food was not over top but tasty. Quality was not bad for an AYCE. You get what you pay for and I was happy with my lunch."}
{"text":"This place is a jewel! The interior looks nice and the sushi is fresh and well prepared. Also, they feature the hard to find yellowtail in sushi and maki which is my personal favourite. Definitely worth a visit, with about $22 for an all-you-can-eat also priced fairly."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time as I invited 4 friends over for sushi.

Called ahead for Tale out.  The order was ready on time.

Restaurant is also roomy and clean.

Great menu selection.  Great food too!  Host was really helpful with recommendation for the right quantities.  

Everyone loved the Sushi, Maki, and Sashimi Party tray, as well as the Dragon Roll. 

I have no hesitation recommending this place.

Can't wait to try it again."}
{"text":"Went for ayce a couple days ago really fast service really good and tasty Nigiri. I also really really liked their seafood soup. Also had take-out from hear a few times since they opened pretty good value for your money good portions and they don't skimp on the fish like some other delivery/takeout sushi places do. I'll keep getting my sushi from these guys for as long as they are open."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night, and was pleasantly surprised to find a new sushi place to visit in the future! For what it costs, the sushi and sashimi is very worth its price. 

I got the sushi and sashimi set, which, at $16, came with six chef's nigiri (salmon, tuna, butterfish, red snapper, cooked shrimp, surf clam/hokkigai), six pieces of California maki, and six pieces of sashimi (salmon x2, tuna, butterfish, cooked shrimp, red snapper). My sister ordered sushi set C, which came with six nigiri (eel, imitation crab, salmon, red tuna, red snapper, hokkigai), six pieces of California rolls, and a salmon hand roll for only $12. My dad got the sashimi set B, which included 18 pieces of sashimi (three sets of octopus, hokkigai, salmon, red tuna, and red snapper) for $13. I feel that mine was most economically friendly since I didn't get any of the cheaper cuts of seafood.

Overall, the fish is quite fresh. The restaurant also does AYCE, which makes me curious about whether quality is maintained with the buffet. However, the sushi rice in both the nigiri and the maki are overseasoned with vinegar. They really need to tone it down! Next time, I think I'll order sashimi to avoid the overly acidic rice...

Service is friendly, and seating is quite spacious. Will visit again!"}
{"text":"I've been to many ayce sushi places around the GTA, and i would have to say this one was pretty good. Their portions were good, sashimi was fresh, and they have some very interesting specialty rolls (TNT Roll...wasabi and ginger, wrapped in salmon). Try it and it'll clear your sinuses right away. Overall it is a decent sushi spot. Only drawback was the drinks were not refillable(especially at $24.99 for a weekend dinner price) and it was at an obscure location (should've been closer to Port Credit area). I would like to see this place succeed. We will definitely be back. Also try the chicken kaarage."}
{"text":"So good! 

We've eaten here a few times and we just love it! We are both vegetarian sushi eaters, so we stick to the many veggie options. Yam tempura, avo-cucumber, asparagus rolls are all so delicious and fresh. The yam tempura is SO good.

Customer service is excellent as are the prices. 
This is our new favorite sushi place, give it a try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great quality sushi and the service is great. A lot of options as far as variety and the specialty rolls are very impressive. I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Sushi restaurant in Port Credit. 
Good food and friendly staff. 
The fish is fresh, the place is clean and the service is fast. My favorite place to eat in this part of the town."}
{"text":"Walked in here for lunch. Cheap all-you-can-eat $16 plus tax. Wasn't expecting much and ordered a Katsu don. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Port Credit/Lakeview is in desperate need of a good sushi place and the truth is that none exists. Alarm bells should always go off when you see Escolar fish served... or as they call it \"white tuna\". Do some research and you will be grossed out quickly. This... a Japanese restaurant serving a fish banned in Japan. 

Anyway. \"Ok\" sushi can be found here. Uninspired, but hey, at least it's something."}
{"text":"My boyfriend booked this place for a party of 22 for my birthday a couple weeks in advanced. As it turned out, they weren't ready for a big party like ours.

As we approached, we seated ourselves as no one greeted us besides our friends.

They have the old school ordering system where you mark what you want on the ordering sheet and it is then given to the Chefs. Because of that, the confusion and back log started to happen. A lot of our food ended up missing and or going to the wrong table. It was a constant wait. We ended up being full from eating almost nothing and waiting.

They should have a system where they punch in the orders and the little receipt prints out so they don't miss more than half of our orders. Because it was ridiculous the amount of food that didn't show up. We had to keep constantly ask about where our food was.

The food was okay, not the greatest, which was really disappointing because I was looking forward to stuffing my face.

The staff, they weren't as knowledgeable as they should be, very slow in my opinion with their service. 

The location looks very run down on the outside which may deter you but the inside is nice.

Overall a good birthday with friends, but really disappointed with the restaurant experience. Do not recommend."}
{"text":"There's a new Itamae (sushi chef) in town....and he's good!

Asaka Sushi opened recently in a strip plaza along the Lakeshore between Cawthra and Hurontario. The plaza itself look a bit tired with a Metro and a few other stores, however the food and service at Asaka are excellent. They are an AYCE Japanese restaurant run by Chinese staff (as most AYCE places are) however they don't have banners up pushing that. The first question asked when you enter is about whether you are there for AYCE (all-you-can-eat) or not.

They have a full menu much like other Japanese resturants but the quality of the sushi is excellent.....perfect portions, very lean salmon and rice at the proper temperature and the prices are also great (with the average price for 2 pieces of nigiri sushi at $3.00).

They have a variety of seating options and while the interior is 'faux lodge', its warm and wide open. They don't have a large sushi bar but the rest of the place is quite roomy and subtle."}
{"text":"Located near Metro supermarket and a bank, with lots of parking in front.
The interior is pretty large with lots of space between tables in case you have kids with you, they also have a few highchairs.
Most sushi restaurants have a small handful of veg options, Asaka has more than others, try their vegetarian combo, only $13, great portion!
The service is always friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"This place is new and I want them to last because they are close by...but they seem to be a hit or miss. In both quality and getting the orders right. It's just so hard to get consistency in an AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and haven't been disappointed yet. While they don't have a lot of cooked food options, their selection of rolls, sashimi and sushi more than make up for it."}
{"text":"We just ordered take out from Asaka...first time, and what a disappointment. I loove Sushi and can tell quality...but...
- seaweed salad - have a look at the picture...usually seaweed salad is served on a bed of lettuce but here the seaweed is just a topping for some iceberg lettuce at Asaka. To top that (no pun) the seaweed was tasteless, not pickled like most places serve so taste was pretty blah
- sushi - the thinest piece of fish on top of rice I have ever seen.
- spicy tuna maki - stale, chewy tempura bits and lots of it. Hardly tasted any tuna!
- green dragon - maybe it's a matter of personal preference but too much mayo - yuck! 

So all in all we feel ripped off. A nice night in with take out ruined. So back we go to Dodai Sushi - awesome sushi that I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here just after it opened and it was amazing. My friends thought so too. Good service, quick, and reasonably priced. Best of all the food tasted fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Straightforward great quality sushi. Don't be fooled by the exterior, it's an old plaza so the outside of the place is not much of a looker but inside is very nice, although a little too quiet for my taste. 

Portions are big, I went with three people, we ordered one starter, 2 combos, and one roll (a dish each plus a shared starter) and it came up to $20 per person (no drinks, we had water). We didn't go with the AYCE menu but the regular menu (you'll be asked at the entrance for your preference). I don't know if I would try the AYCE, we came in pretty hungry, left very satisfied and paid $2 less than the AYCE. 

Anyway, loved the place! It's very close to home so I will definitely come back."}
