{"text":"Visited for lunch today for first time.  First impression was cracked and fading furniture. Decor was non existence and big screen TVs were playing child cartoons.  Food was typical fair but we needed to ask for fish sauce for our vermicelli dishes.  Never saw this before in a Vietnamese restaurant.  It always comes automatically.  Service was poor with reaction to our thankyou's with uh-uh's.  My daughter asked for the a doggy bag and the waitress returned with a styrofoam box and essentially threw it on the table.  I asked her if she was going to put it in the box and clearly this was out of her job description.  Unlikely to return with so many other options.  They will likely stick around as they have a very good location next to Ernest Manning and fill up most Noon hours.  No pride of ownership in this place."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. It took a half hour to order. The server did not even say a word to us and seemed very annoyed that we were there."}
{"text":"One the recommendation of my son I tried out this quaint Vietnamese restaurant for the first time this past weekend. I was surprised at how quiet it was for a Saturday evening. The decor was clean, modern & comfortable.   Our party of four was greeted & seated without delay. We were provided with menus, a pot of tea and glasses of water within a couple of minutes of being seated.  The menu is quite extensive, moderately priced and good value. The average entree is easily under $10. Dinner for four hungry people was just $42 plus tip. The portions are generous and the food hot and tasty. Located about a half block west of the Westside Center sports facility just off 69 St and close to LRT.   Well worth trying. We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Food is always served hot and fresh! For a place that is usually busy, service is good! Their seating area is quite big and roomy which makes for a comfortable dining experience.   Something else I appreciate about this place is that their prices are fairly cheap - average for the delicious, fresh and hot food they have. Very clean place too!"}
{"text":"Most of the servers are quite friendly. The food is decent but a little pricy. Convenient for students and business people in the area, good place to resort to when you're deciding where to grab a bite. Cleanliness is questionable... Overall, Viet Hai is an okay place to eat. Not terrible, but not amazing either!"}
{"text":"Went in tonight and made an in house order for takeout. Didn't wait very long and everything tasted so good. Will definitely go back and try more on the menu!"}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant is located in a little strip plaza off 69St and 17Ave in the SW. As this  business is closer to home than my usual go-to Vietnamese place, I decided to give it a go for a takeout meal of pork vermicelli and beef pho.  Consistent with similar restaurants, the quoted wait time for a take out order was 15 minutes. Prices are good, with most dishes costing $10 or less. All in all, I'd say the meal was fine: adequate portions, crispy spring rolls, spicy broth; but, I wasn't wowed.   If you don't feel like travelling further into the city, this place is fine. I may visit again in the future to try their bahn mi or when I just want an easy meal close to home."}
{"text":"The service is below average. The food is good but it can be hit and miss sometimes. The atmosphere is good when it's not packed with high school students during their lunch hour. It's not bad if you can find a seat, it's just that during the week you won't because the students can walk there."}
{"text":"Viet Hai is a nice little Vietnamese restaurant tucked into the new strip mall.  Tucked into a small slice of the building, Viet Hai provides delicious Vietnamese at a reasonable price. To be entirely transparent, I love Vietnamese food so much that I would have a hard time hating it. That being said this place was better than the average Vietnamese. There were even chopped up peanuts on the table that you could add to your dish (may be an allergy concern for some).  I'll be back for more vermicelli!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little vietnamese restaurant by the waves coffee house just off of 69th street. This is my neighbourhood so I go here often with all my friends. It's super close to everyones house.  I like the Taro bubble tea here, and I usually order #74 or #47 (Yes I have been here often), which are the curry vermicelli soup and the pork vermicelli with spring rolls respectively. We usually order a spring roll appetizer as well. All of it is really tasty.   I come here quite often with friends or family and have never had a terrible experience. The food comes really quickly and the servers are nice and willing to help you. I'll obviously be back, I am a regular at this place. :)"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a friend because we were attending an event at Rundle College nearby. We both got subs and I was ready to eat my own hand so I thought my veggie sub was pretty good but my less ravenous and more sane friend said her chicken sate sub was only ok. I wasn't a huge fan of the large amount of mayo they put in the sub - I know I could have asked for it without mayo but I wasn't sure what they normally put inside. They also use longer skinnier buns for their subs, which means the bread is a big harder and not as soft as the wider fluffier baguettes I usually get. They are also kind of expensive for Vietnamese subs (around $8) which I'm used to getting for like $5-$6. I doubt I will be back in this area of Calgary anyway anytime soon but if you're a student in the area or live nearby I think it might be worth checking out for their other food! They did have a very interesting dish come out that went up in flames!"}
{"text":"Best prices for a great meal.  Always leave satisfied having my pho craving met.   Not always the fastest service but very friendly servers.  Never too crowded."}
