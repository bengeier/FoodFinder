{"text":"Really awesome bartender willing to chat you up and make you feel welcome, great food, awesome drinks."}
{"text":"Went there this past Friday with family and food was great! Deep fried perogies were the best ever! Food is homemade not frozen and taste is great. This is not fancy place but small, family run establishment with great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"The Ridgewood was a great place for a fish fry I got the yellow perch dinner and I've had perch dinners at numerous places and I have to say they were one of the best nice family atmosphere plenty of parking although I must say right in the middle of my dinner one of the establishments That was supposed to be closed came in and rudely ask me if I would move my car now I should have just finished my dinner that I had half eaten which would have been another 15-20 minutes and then move my car cuz as we would have been leaving it was a heating and cooling company next door can't remember the name I'll get it one of these days cuz I will be going back there to eat long story short the owner / manager gave me 50% off my next fish fry due to this great inconvenience which I thought was very nice maybe my next fish Drive will be even better as it will be 50% off haha anyhow I rate the Ridgewood with in my top 3 in Cleveland Ohio as it is located in Parma on Ridge Road can't wait to go back awesome fish fry downside was the Shrimp Basket would have been better if the shrimps were butterflied instead it was popcorn shrimp nonetheless there was plenty of it and it wasn't too bad"}
{"text":"Bring cash. They don't take credit cards.   Even better the second time. The deep fried sauerkraut pierogies are ridiculous. The kraut is sort of caramelized. The fried pike was crispy and light. Loved the cole slaw, too."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  We went for their fish dinner.  Food was ok.  Yes, they were busy because of Lent, however, we had to wait an hour for our dinner.  Tacky decor."}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I heard this place had a very good fish fry. However, after arriving there on Friday 3/11/16 (during Lent), they were out of the Lake Erie Perch they advertise.   The place is very much a dive/hole-in-the-wall.  They had a 45 minute wait for a table for dinner and it was not because they were busy. There were some empty tables but we did not see anyone or anything coming out of the kitchen to serve those waiting in the dining room.   Anyway, we decided to wait at the bar until a table became available.There was a guy with the nasty ponytail working behind the bar (who I believe is a member of the family that owns the place). He ignored us for quite a while as did the female that was behind the bar with him.  We finally placed an order for two draft beers (LaBatt on tap) with the guy but he never delivered the beer to us.  He served dinners from the kitchen to others at the bar he then proceeded to take and fill other drink orders from other patrons at the bar. He totally ignored us or forgot about us.  They had a full house but it really was not that busy.  We felt shunned/subbed by this establishment.  I absolutely do not want to have to beg for a beer or for any food in any restaurant that I decide to visit. There are too many other places that have good fish fries to have to deal with this.  The food may be good but I will never know.  I have no intentions of ever returning to this place.  My recommendation: AVOID THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"Why hipsters give accolades to bars in trendy, upscale areas like Ohio City and label them \"dive bars\" just because they have a pseudo- atmosphere I'll never understand. Places like Ridewood Inn are the real deal.   Nestled on the corner of Ridge and Snow, it's exactly what you would expect of a nice little neighborhood bar: cozy atmosphere, cheap beers, cheeky yet personable bartender.   The unexpected advantage of this joint is that they have really clean, nice bathrooms as well as amazing food. I can't speak for the rest of the menu, but the pirogies are something Parma can certainly be proud of."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pierogies I've had in my life! The food was great. The staff was very friendly. I love this place and will be back. I wish there were more restaurants/bars like this around. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This is not a bar for dancing and trying fancy cocktails. This is a straight up neighborhood bar, prices are cheap for drinks, pierogies are fat and delicious.  Ambiance is old bar, things are a bit worn, lighting is dim. It's usually pretty quiet so it's a great place to go if you want to be able to talk amongst friends.  Parking is easy. Staff is friendly enough, not obtrusive or trying to make small talk. If you want cheap classic beer and drinks and want pierogies that will fill you up and then some, all for a great price then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Next to Tal's Liquor store is the Ridgewood Inn which proclaims to have the best damn fish fry in town, or parma, I forget..  I can't speak to that but it was very good on its own.   The scrod was pretty good which I had. Baked, flavorful, with a buttery, crunchy breading on top. With 2 pierogies, rye bread, and coleslaw [with a vinegar not mayonnaise base] for $11, it was a good value. The cabbage and noodles were good, my dad couldn't stop telling him they tasted like his mom's [who came over the boat middle-aged]: slightly burned, fried [not boiled like most places do]; they were tasty.   The place is sort of dark in there with dark wood and probably afters years of indoor smoking. If you're going for the fish fry, I'd arrive before 4:30 or so, otherwise you'll have to wait. One side is seating and the other is a bar, in case you'd like to have a shot of whiskey and a beer with your meal, like the man next to me had, 80 years young.  I'd rate this place a high 3 stars."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to my first fish fry on the final Friday in Lent.  My goal was to get fish and perogies.  I called in a take out order and I could tell there was a lot of background noise because I had to repeat my order a couple times.  When I got to the bar I waited just a couple of minutes before my would be fish and perogi feast arrived.  Much to my dismay, it contained fish and fries.  I chalk it up to my bad, because I could have just driven up there to make the order rather than cell phone it in.  The fish turned out to be pretty good and just what I was looking for.  The coleslaw was really good and the fries were okay.  Where a point is deducted is the tiny container of tarter sauce given for a large fish meal.  I probably got nearly a pound of fish and only two ounces of sauce.  I need that fish to sauce ratio closer to even money.  All in all, pretty good and I can probably ask for 7 tarter sauces next time."}
{"text":"Stopped by Ridgewood Inn recently and had a yummy Stella Artois with some pierogies with onions. The pierogies were delicious as was my beer. They have a good fish fry here, but I wasn't in the mood for a full dinner. The server wasn't very chipper, but then again, neither am I.  It was pretty quiet in the bar, but the food was good. Can't wait to try the fish fry again."}
{"text":"Disappointed.   Been in neighborhood 27 years, first time here.  Outside is inviting, inside run down!  The booth 2 of us had was horrible seats, moving, and springs not there!!!!!! You sat and went to floor.  Food average, greasy, but service was very good.   Not a comfortable place to go have dinner at!"}
{"text":"Yes, this is a dive bar in need of a facelift for more years than I can remember. In fact, they just now went from cash only to taking credit cards. But let me tell you, hands down, this joint has the best Lake Erie Perch dinner you'll ever taste! The coleslaw and fries are delicious and really compliment the perch. Likewise, the pierogies are out of this world.  It's a shame but this place just does not get the credit it deserves."}
{"text":"The food tasted like it was microwaved instead of cooked fresh.  I've had better."}
