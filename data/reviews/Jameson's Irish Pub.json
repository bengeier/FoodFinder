{"text":"Decided to try this place out after sampling a couple of really tasty items from their booth at Taste of Calgary 2013, sadly our restaurant experience was not up to par with the experience at TOC.  The location is in a prime spot on 17th ave sw where you could spend hours on the patio people watching.    Service, our server was friendly and attentive.  Food, went during brunch/lunch time and decided to try their traditional eggs benny.  Food was a little bit slow to come out.  Once it did arrive it was a bit of a disappointment.  I asked for soft poached eggs, one came out hard and the other was soft.  Hash browns, omg they were super crusty and almost inedible.  It was a hot day and we waited long enough for the food so I didn't want to bother with sending it back.  The price for the portion would've been a good value if the food was good.  There's definitely room for improvement here.  I did see a table order burgers with yam fries that looked quite appetizing.  So will give it another shot one of these days."}
{"text":"Pretty average pub - the food is great here but the servers can really be hit and miss -any time I've been here they are either great ie: drink never gets empty or the opposite you will wait for a set of cutlery while your food has been set down over 5mins. They have good offers mid week - wings/ wine night on Thursday. A fun and busy spot at the weekend!"}
{"text":"St Paddy's Day JOKE!  This 17th avenue location is ridiculous.  8 of us PRE bought $5.00 tickets in order to wait in line for LESS amount of time then people who had not purchased tickets.   2 of us were already in the pub. We arrived at 1830, still relatively early for a weekday event and saw two clearly different lines.   Line 1: at least 30 people deep  Line 2: 3 people deep (when we joined)   The ticket clearly reads \"ticket holders receive priority entry - subject to AGLC/FIRE REGULATIONS\"   Now, we aren't new to how rules work and 3 out of our group are former industry staff so we get the whole capacity thing. Two of us promptly got in, leaving four of us left. Over an hour later we get in.  Only after witnessing numerous non ticket holders jumping the queue, friends of friends of door guys, managers etc. All the while being told their at capacity and then letting the non ticket holders line in FIRST, \"to be fair\" because they were waiting for SO LONG.  Now, the whole point of purchasing a ticket is to have PRIORITY over mon ticket holders.  There was no band or dancers, fiddlers or bagpipers and we were left with awful top 40s and over priced green beer.   Never again.  Not the way to run an establishment."}
{"text":"Great location, nice atmosphere and the service was pretty good.  However, if I were go back again I think I would stick with just having drinks!  I tried their eggs benedict, which at $9 seemed like a great value.  The portion was a good size, with a side of shredded hash brown potatoes and a cup of fresh fruit rather than the usual meager one or two slices of fruit like many other places.  However, that's where my enthusiasm ended.  Their eggs were poached in an egg poacher, so were overcooked and flavourless.  I can do better at home.  The potatoes were even more overcooked.  I think they'd been sitting on the side of the grill for the past hour, as they were so crunchy and chewy, they were almost inedible.  So all in all, not really worth it, even at $9.    Like I said, maybe a nice cool drink on the patio, but other than that I don't think I will be adventurous enough to try any more food there."}
{"text":"***Update*** Went back today August 5 and had a better experience. It was all due to Danielle's great attitude. She was pleasant and always had a great smile for us. A few things were missed but nothing serious. Heidi you must give Danielle, I think that is her name, our thanks, you need more people like her there."}
{"text":"We went to Jameson's with a dozen people to celebrate a birthday.  When we got there we put our name on a list for a table.  While we were waiting for a table we all managed to get stools at the bar, so we took our names off the list.  Awhile later a dude comes by and takes everyone's stools away.  I guess it's what they do on Saturday nights to cram more people in there, but no one said a thing to us when we took our name off the list for a table (we told them we were taking our name off the list because we all had bar stools).  We were a bit miffed when this happened, and they (the bar staff, the stool thief, and the manager) were all pretty rude and disrespectful to us.  One of the bar staff told us that every weekend they take away the stools and every weekend people get upset about it.  Yet they continue to do it...  We didn't stay, and won't be back to any of the Jameson's (even though the other locations have always been pretty good)."}
{"text":"Updated menu is very disappointing- they've changed the good things and prices have increased and not worth it at all. My friend waited for our server who didn't show for at least 10 minutes. Asked another server for a glass of water who said sure.. but it never came. She had to go to the bar to get a drink. Waited so long for nachos that had the smallest amount of cheese on. Meanwhile the restaurant and bar is barely half full, yet so many staff on. My friend went to the washroom where 4 of the servers were talking and fixing themselves, yet still one of them is walking around with her butt cheeks hanging out. Not a good look, poor service, average food. This place used to be amazing!!! :("}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service was terrible.  Very slow.  After we got seated and ordered a drink, the waitress dropped the drink and took off - oh, but I noticed a few blonde waitresses either chatting among themselves or flirting with the male patrons.  The location is good but given the vast number of other pubs and restaurants in the area I wouldn't go here again."}
{"text":"Horrible staff, worst bar I have ever been to.  The bouncers who nasty power hungry jerks and management was no help. I wouldn't recommend anyone going there. Too many other great bars in Calgary to waste money there."}
{"text":"Awesome beers and food. Way better place to go for industry night then Hudsons.  I've come here on many many occasions with friends. Sometimes it can be a little to loud for my liking. But otherwise this place is awesome Great service, great beers and an all around fun time."}
{"text":"An Irish pub which does not serve Irish beer.  Nasty food. We ordered simple food which was inedible. The nachos had some sort of strong tasting cheese which the waitress did not know about. I took one bite of my veggie burger and the whole thing fell apart. I had to proceed with eating my burger with utensils. It doesn't take a course to figure out how to put together a veggie patty which doesn't fall apart. The coleslaw had one taste: mayo. The gravy was obviously powdered with liquid added on. I could not finish any of my food, which is rare as I hate wasting food. Service was decent though, but I would never step foot there again. Franchise at its best."}
{"text":"Courtney is an amazing server and I enjoyed the wings very much. This was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Jameson's was a quick stopover for our girls night out. We went to visit some friends who were there celebrating birthdays. It was quite busy and from what I could see, everyone seemed to be having a good time.  We were advised that the service wasn't that great and that going to the bar to get drinks was our best bet. After having some shots at the bar, we grabbed our cocktails  and headed back to the table. I had a sip of my girlfriend's sangria and it was actually really refreshing and delicious! Normally whenever I have a sangria, it's either really potent with a bottom of the barrel dry wine or tastes like the bartender squeezed whatever was left from the random juice boxes into the glass.  As cold as it was outside, it was unbearably hot inside that we finished our drinks so we could go out for some fresh air and relief.  Although I didn't get a true experience (sit, relax and snacking on some food), I wouldn't mind coming back and enjoying a sangria."}
{"text":"Jameson's on 17th? What can I say? Well, I've been meaning to try this place for quite some time as I pass by it frequently. It's conveniently located close to the street with a nice patio out front. Inside the decor is that of your typical Irish pub, charming & quaint with a large wooden bar and ample seating.   My friend and I were excited to stop in for a drink and to soak up some sunny 17th ave ambience on the patio. The place was pretty packed for a sunny saturday afternoon and the bar was very busy. Perhaps that explains why service was so painfully slow and disorganized.. We waited 15 minutes before someone even came over to check on us and the adjacent table. A visibly annoyed couple seated next to us got tired of waiting and simply walked out completely unnoticed.  Our drinks were fine and we enjoyed our brief time there but the service was really, really bad. Our server didn't even bother to return to get our food order, so we opted to go somewhere else along 17th ave.  I really wanted to like this place because it is a pretty cool spot for people watching, good drinks and a friendly atmosphere BUT management needs to be made aware of the crap service as it's clear that they are losing business as a direct result."}
{"text":"Wednesday Night! Wednesday Night! Wednesday Night! Did I mention Wednesday Night is the night to go here? Wing night mixed with a fantastic beer special. What a better way to celebrate hump day? The waitresses are phenomenal. Not once did I completely finish my drink before she was asking if I wanted another, and our food came out quick, warm, and perfect. She also remembered my beer and wing order from two weeks ago, and asked if I wanted the same thing as last time. They also have TV's everywhere playing all the different games on, so you won't miss out on any of the action. If your looking for a great casual time to have some drinks, eat some wings, hang out with friends, and watch the game this is an awesome place to stop by."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Jameson's for a good long time. Looks like they have done a swap of all their staff. Server was very prompt and helpful.   Didn't have a chance to try the food but menu has definitely been updated and looks quite tasty. They have food and drink specials everyday and brunch menu looks pretty tasty.   3 stars cause was pretty average pub stop in for some drinks. Service was good and will go back for brunch for sure. Feel food will either up or down the stars so stay tuned for an update."}
{"text":"Had a very good Saturday lunch there. Good was above expectations. Only thing was the atmosphere was littered with overly loud \"frat boys\""}
{"text":"Another complicated rating...let's go 3.5 just to spilt hairs.   Came here for mywifey's and boyfriends birthday, due to the size of a our group we had our own area in the back which was nice. Until you had to go anywhere else in the place and it's like a new nightclub. Terrible DJ crap, and young drunk, drunk people. It was so packed to go outside was a 20 minute adventure to try and get through the crowd. Going to get shots cuz our server sucked was another ordeal. it was still faster to go to the bar for a drink than wait for our server. Not kidding, it got to the point you ordered two drinks as you would finish at least two before she came back.   I didn't eat, I did notice they do say on their menu what is gluten free, but it's like 2 salads, so don't get here as a celiac planning to have a good meal.   Meh, we'll see if we come back."}
{"text":"They blare dance music but no one is dancing. Of course they're not dancing.. It's a pub... But with dance music. Maybe go here if you like listening to obnoxiously loud crappy b-list top 40 recreationally?"}
{"text":"HELLO JAMESONS!!! FINALLY! I've wait all  year for this place to open (I'm in love with Irish pubs!). This one met every single one of my expectations on opening night. I partied here on Friday night with my girlfriends and we had a blast. It was nice that we got a complimentary drink on opening night, but even better that the place seemed to be doing well. I mean it was only day one, but the staff were very polite, prompt and knowledable. We didn't try out the menu on Friday night but I can guarentee I will be back to do so very soon.   IMO places are always amazing when they first open, but I hope this one stays amazing. Get there soon if you can!"}
{"text":"This Jameson is even better than the one at Brentwook! I went for the 3$ alitas madness and it was terrific.  Downside is that I went with a group of friends and they did want to split the bill. Moreover, they forced us to pay 18% tip."}
{"text":"I would only go back here to have a drink.  I thought the meat and cheese board was over priced and not great selections. The service was good."}
{"text":"Love this place, it's been our gathering spot for over a year now! Management, staff and food are all great and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an Irish pub on 17th"}
{"text":"Line up only to pump up the rep. Pretty bad business plan."}
{"text":"I came solo one evening for their oyster night, they are serving $1.00 oysters on Thursdays, so I started with one dozen ending my evening with 80 total, I was told I hold their record, I don't do that often, but was in the mood, the service there was great, the drinks were perfect, and most of all, the atmosphere is great for a Irish Pub. I have been there a few times in total and the service and food is always terrific!"}
{"text":"After a long day of exploring Calgary and little bit of bar hopping, we ended up at Jameson's for dinner, drinks and a basketball game. We sat right at the bar and the bartender was friendly and happy to make drinks suggestions and give us the lay of the land. We enjoyed a few adult beverages, french fries and fish tacos. Typical pub fare, not gourmet but definitely hit the spot. The fish tacos were surprisingly delicious (fair warning the drinks may have contributed to that lol). My friend who lives nearby says that she's been to the bar many times and always has a good experience so it seems like this is a great local to enjoy the game, a bite, a beverage and good company."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Jameson's it was a Saturday night for birthday drinks. I was pumped because I'm Irish and I love a good pub. Imagine my surprise when it was wall to wall dudebros and pounding music. Lesson learned. There is a DJ and club music on Fridays & Saturday nights. Somehow, they still run food, kudos to the servers because its a madhouse in there.  I went back on a reasonable Wednesday evening and the Irish pub I had craved was found. I enjoyed a delicious glass of sangria, which delighted me because I make it at home and it was comparable to mine. The cocktail game is strong for a girly drink lover like myself.   I ordered the pulled pork pizza because I am addicted to pulled pork. Its been really hit or miss in Calgary for me so I was wary but hopeful. Thankfully, it exceeded my expectations. So delicious I could have eaten the entire thing by myself.  As an added bonus, you can post on social media with their hash tags and have it displayed on the TVs while you eat. That was fun to play with on Instagram.  I'll definitely return to try the rest of the cocktails!"}
{"text":"Some places just don't get it. Five friends went to this pub on wing Wednesday to have some beers and wings. We were there for three hours and enjoyed better than average wings and courteous and competent service. We had 4/5 rounds of drinks and everyone ordered wings at some point. The problem arose at the end of the evening when we had a mere 15 wings left at our table and we were informed that we were not allowed to take them to go as per restaurant policy. Obviously, I understand why this policy is in place, the restaurant only wants people consuming they're inexpensive wings while they're also purchasing drinks from their bar. We informed the bar manager that we would pay regular price for the wings as the thought of throwing 15 perfectly good wings in the garbage seemed wasteful and unnecessary. He agreed to this solution however when the bill came we were charged for two orders of wings ($27). The bottom line is that Jamison's enforced their policy on a table that had spent over $200, and the end result is we all left feeling under appreciated. This is clearly a quick case where the manager should have excercised better judgement. In the end the manager did take one of the orders of wings off of our bill after I complained that it seemed a little steep. There are dozens of pubs in the city that I can choose from and I highly doubt I will choose this pub again as it left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Really nice Irish pub, I really liked the Top 40 music the DJ was playing through the night.  There is no dance floor but that doesn't mean you can't dance... several people were dancing and enjoying the music close to their tables or by the bar.  I didn't see a big variety of drinks and beers, and they didn't have a special on draft beer either but we still had a good time.  The music was loud, so if you go to talk and catch up with friends, you'll need to be shouting so they can hear you.   The place is full of screens everywhere, so it must be a good place to go and watch hockey while having a drink and snacks."}
{"text":"I saw the video of a patron who got seriously beat up by Jameson's bouncers on the sidewalk of 17 Ave. in the news, and I cannot bring myself to go to this place anymore."}
{"text":"Another place on 17th that I wasn't particularly fond of. The service was painfully slow, it took us forever to order ice tea. The food was nothing special, but at least the server wasn't rude. I'd come here again if I was in a group, but I don't think I'd seek this place out. Average at best."}
{"text":"I've been to Jameson's 2 or 3 times now, always on a week night (though I've heard weekends are a little rowdier). The menu is a lot of typical pub fare, with some Irish specialities in the mix.   My friend and I ordered the Cajun Basa with veggies and salad and the Jamie burger with smoked cheddar, mushrooms and bacon with Caesar salad. Both dishes were cooked really nicely; the fish was tender and nicely spiced and the burger was juicy. We also each had a glass of the house red (Barefoot Cabernet) which was an okay cheap wine.   Our waitress was friendly and helpful both times I've been there, and the food hasn't disappointed. I'd like to go check it out on a weekend night, but so far I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Ok price for ok food and ok service.  Can't say there is anything particularly right or wrong with Jameson's, probably there isn't.  Looked like one of the countless pubs I've seen, plain and common.  Portion size was decent though, and drink menu, while not too overwhelming, was reasonably sufficient.  But... Irish pub? Really? Sounds like an \"authentic Italian restaurant\" to me.  Don't hesitate if you are invited, look elsewhere if you are craving something exquisite."}
{"text":"You know all those Irish folk songs about Irish maidens and their storied beauty and their eyes as bright as the hillside and with flowing flaxen hair and what not?  Well, there's a waitress here who all of them were written about.  I know that's incredibly tacky to say - after all, I'm more than positive waitresses around the world collectively roll their eyes at the whole \"patron thinks I'm the greatest thing since Guinness\" thing. Don't worry, gentle reader, I didn't scribble out some sort of pathetic plea accompanied by my number on my credit receipt.   No, in a much preferable and completely less pathetic outing, I scribbled a semi-anonymous yelp review about her on the internet days later where she'll never see it. Ooh, that one stings.  But to the blonde waitress with the Irish name, congratulations on your exceptional genetics. If I was reviewing this place based on their ability to hire good looking women who make me part with larger than usual tips, they'd get 5 stars.  But, let's move on and peek under Jameson's kilt to see if this place has any balls.  This Jamesons is the new kid on the block, bringing it's not-so-original flavor of Irish Pub to the 17th ave stretch. That's not a knock on ol' Jameson's, mind you, but there are just SO many Irish pubs already. That said, this place is set up well and feels far less dark and sticky than, say, Kilkenny's up north.  We came here over lunch hoping to steal a seat on the patio, but alas, there were none to be had. It's awesome Jameson's HAS a patio though given how few places along the stretch actually do. We parked it inside near the big, open windows and were served promptly.   The menu is more or less your standard pub fare at your standard 17th-ave establishment rate. I got the Irish Club, which is probably as authentically Irish as Lucky Charms. It was tasty, though - not too salty, not too small.   The beer menu is pretty extensive - it's no bottle screw bill's, but it's not trying to be. A good mix of smaller breweries and your old, recognizable favorites.  I also enjoyed a Village Blonde beer, which was apparently supposed to come with a free cup. Furnish my home AND drink beer? Don't mind if I do. Sadly, the free cup never materialized. Looks like I'll need to take more trips to IKEA.  Is this an above average place for a summer lunch? I guess so, given the patio setup and the big windows. If you're a sun-seeker or want to catch the breeze on a warm day, I'd definitely recommend this place over others on the red mile.  But, everything else was sort of a shoulder shrug. Not bad at all, just not amazing. Except, of course, the blonde Irish waitress who delivered the drinks. Lassie, you can swing your flaxen hair my way any day."}
{"text":"Jameson's blew my mind a few weeks ago.  My spouse and I decided to eat traditional dishes only.  I tried the Boxty and it was amazing.  Apparently not many people order this dish and I don't know why.  I didn't eat it when I was in Ireland so don't know if it was authentic or not, but I still think it's a must try.  Maybe it's the sauce with leek that scares people off.  Don't be afraid!  My spouse really enjoyed the Chicken Pot Pie and while he thought the serving wouldn't be enough for him at first, he said he was satisfied.    Being that I was already thinking outside the box, I ordered the Grapefruit Stiegl-Radler.  Another fabulous choice, I must say.  My spouse doesn't like beer but he even tolerated a sip.  It's really light and refreshing.  A bit pricey but great for summer.  We were here on a Sunday for brunch, so it wasn't overly busy or loud.  A great time to go if you just want to enjoy people watching from the patio, truly relax and have a visit with someone."}
{"text":"Yikes.  I'm trying to give them a four rating, but today's all you can eat fish and chips really endanger it.  My entire table was really unimpressed with the meal.  All they could say was that the white fish filets were literally dripping in grease ( so not properly drained), but also that it just was unpleasant as a result.  I don't think they'll ever want to go through that again.  Jameson's on 17th, if you're still looking for some more helpful comments, drain the fish better somehow.  Of a table of 4, everyone was unanimous that the fish and chips was actually unpleasant."}
{"text":"The location is great, people watching has always been, the food was always decent.  The nachos were always worth sharing.  I guess they figure with a good location they think people won't notice the nose dive the food has taken.  I'll still go for a drink but not going there to eat anymore."}
{"text":"I checked out this new location late on a Friday night. It's pretty standard for a chain-type bar. The bar is located in the center of the space so it's easy to get a drink without necessarily having to cram in between people to get up to the bar. They have a solid beer selection with your common domestics and some great import options like Kronenberg and Delirium.   The staff were really on the ball. The bartenders were quick and the tables were always kept clear of empties. The most refreshing part of the staff was that the bouncers were friendly. On our way in we chatted them up a little as they checked our ID's and they seemed to be enjoying their evening."}
{"text":"Thursdays is half price wine bottles.  So good prices. Also $1 oysters. Service is a little slow.  Server takes awhile to check up on you. Our party started ordering 2 drinks at a time because we're not sure when the next time she'll come around. However when she does come around, she's very nice.  My experience here is eh, not bad but not great."}
{"text":"This place was nicely decorated and although it was off of the center of the strip, I quite enjoyed the beer and food here.  Very reasonable pricing, and it wasn't a dive bar."}
