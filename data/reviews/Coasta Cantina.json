{"text":"Im giving this place one star based on the food and customer service. Our server was crabby as hell and my food was disgusting. I ordered a chimichanga and it wasnt even fried it was like a burrito with disgusting pot roast in the middle. To make.matters even worse my son ordered taquitos and one fell off the plate and the server picked it up with her hands and.placed it back on the plate. I wasnt gonna let him eat it after that. All around disgusted with my experience here."}
{"text":"Senor Miguel's at the Suncoast Casino is a typical Amerimex place, with nachos, tostadas, chimichangas, and fajitas.  The service isn't very friendly or attentive, but they give you tons of chips and bowls of salsa and warm bean dip.  The food is more American than Mexican, but they give generous portions.  The best part about this place is that it's located right next to the Oyster Bar, which shares the same kitchen.  You can order anything the Oyster Bar has and have it served to you along with your enchiladas.    This is a great way for people with kids to comfortably enjoy the food from the Oyster Bar without having to balance the kids on the barstools.    I will probably would go back when my in-laws are in town, because they can get their Amerimex food and I get the Oyster Bar's bouillabaisse and oysters, while the kids are comfortably wedged in between us in a booth :)

By the way, their \"fried ice cream\" is NOT fried.  It's just a scoop of vanilla rolled in a sticky-sweet coconut and peanut mixture."}
{"text":"Food was not good at all.  Chile rellano tasted chalky and chile was inedible.  My guy had an enchilada combo and said it tasted like a hungry man dinner. It was all very bland. Some of the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Service was good except that when the server asked if it was good, I told her it really wasn't and she ran away. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Coasta in the SunCoast.
It was a delightful experience. We both ordered the chicken Montery, one of the specials.  I would rate it outstanding from flavor and presentation perspectives.  Very creative cuisine. Attentive service and atmosphere conducive to a very pleasant meal."}
{"text":"The big special is two items for $7.99.  That is a discount over the regular $12.00.  That would be fine but the deal is not that great.  2 tacos for $7.99 is just ok.  The problem is that our server was so mean and nasty about making us all pull out a players card to get the deal before she even served any drinks.  She looked out the top of her glasses at us and acted like the special was much better than it is.  Most places ask to see one card per couple, including the buffet which offers good discounts for players card holders.  But this lady demanded my mother and father, who were tired on their trip, each go through their items and pull out a card each and acted like a cop rather than a food server.
The chips and salsas they served were adequate and we each had a drink before we decided we were not willing to be abused by this mean spirited server any longer and we did not order the 2 item special in spite of the server insisting it was such a good deal.  We got a better deal down the way at TGIF for better food and they did not act like we were criminals.  Never going back here again."}
{"text":"Very bland, genetic food. Nothing offensive on the menu but nothing spectacular either."}
{"text":"The food was only so so.  The shredded beef tacos and pork enchiladas were on the bland side and the rice was very dry and tasteless. The dips that came with the chips were good and the margaritas were pretty good for the price."}
{"text":"Very slow  service and poor wait staff. Worst Mexican food I've ever had. About on par for the Orleans."}
{"text":"Very tasty food! I've grown up in Southern Ca and consider myself a pretty good judge of good Mexican food, but I did not expect to find it at a hotel in Vegas! The taquitos and relleno are scrump.  Recommend giving it a try!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this restaurant for 4 years, it was senior miguels and then was taken over by the casino.  Ever since the casino took over the food has continued to go down in quality.  They removed the margarita and taco special which was really good.  You used to wait to be seated....now its 50% empty.    Now they have a taco and enchilada buffet that is absoulutely horrible.  They dont even give you a plate to use!!!!   They make you use the appetizer plate on the table.  Food is cold and doughy...I mean really.  Dont bother to waste your time coming to this restaurant unless your already in the hotel, their are many better mexican restaurants all over the place.   Oh and by the way, the servers are rude and not knowledgeable about the menu, I mean just an overall bad place."}
{"text":"Endless enchiladas and Tacos on Wednesdays and Thursdays. They kind if went downhill with quality because now they do buffet (serve yourself style) versus freshly made enchiladas and tacos. They also don't do endless margaritas anymore. Buffet style enchiladas and kind of hard after 5 minutes.

Nice decor and attentive staff. They were a 4 but after the change a strong 3."}
{"text":"Friendly service & it just works for us :)

We've been coming here for years and we always order the exact same dishes! This is very unusual for me but it just works for us as we always share. We start with the chicken flautas which are always on point with some guacamole on the side & sour cream. We then move into the steak fajitas! We get our veggies cooked extra long & the flavors are on point. We always drizzle some extra fresh lime juice and the steak is cooked to perfection. 
We recently started adding the churros to our dinner because they are too good to pass up. Overall it's a very casual place and the service for the most part has been consistently good.
The Suncoast is definitely geared towards seniors and I actually like that! It's quiet and we just slip in to enjoy our meal & then we're out..."}
{"text":"Coasta Cantina is the new name for the restaurant Don Miguel's.  You still get the three types of dip with the chips, menu seems to be the same, and the specials seem to be the same.  I had the carnitas, and it was okay; the pork could have used more flavor, but it was okay.  It's just your typical corporate owned Mexican Restaurant, nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Try the ceviche and find heaven on earth! I was bummed when I found out Don Miguel's was now called Coasta Cantina but the menu is pretty much the same and all I cared about was that they still had my favorite ceviche. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"I always get fooled when the menu states \"large, jumbo or giant shrimp\".  Well I did it again.  Ordered tequila shrimp.  I think it was 5/6 medium size shrimps placed around something(I ate it but don't remember what it was).  Meal tab with drinks around $57 for my twin kids and I.    Shoulda went to the casino buffet instead.  Oh well, at least I have an opinion. DON'T ORDER SHRIMP ANYWHERE!!"}
{"text":"This was the first (and last) time we had eaten at this restaurant. We were at The Orleans and thought we would try it out (since TGI Fridays had a long wait). The waitress, Oralia, was very nice and got our drinks right away. The chips and salsa were nothing special. We did have to ask several times to get refills on our soda. When our food came out  all 3 of our orders were wrong. Finally after getting everything correct the food was not that great. When the bill came we saw they had charged us for a side of cheese (which we did ask for but they didn't tell us there was a charge for it) and they charged us for an item that ended up being sent back because it was wrong. We finally got the bill sorted out and went to pay the waitress, using credit cards and cash, and that became another ordeal I won't go into. Bottom line: DON'T EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Reading all these reviews I'm totally confused by all these negative reviews. I'm wondering if they've changed management since the reviews we're all old & our experience was so positive. Went last night & ordered the carne asada & I can't stop thinking about the deliciousness. It was literally magic. The flavors & quality of meat were amazing. Did someone tell the cook we were VIP's?!?? ;-) I Emphatically recommend the carne asada. Hubs got the carnitas and they were really good too. I'd be happy with that order but the CARNE ASADA....!!!!!   Wonder if I can talk Hubs into going again night...."}
{"text":"Whenever I eat here I really want to love this place.  The chips & assorted salsas/dips you start with are SO great.  And then I get my entree.  And then I'm just left feeling mediocre about this place.

What's good: The aforementioned chips & salsa. $3 house margaritas (WHA?!? Yes Please).  Most sauces are good.  Food seems pretty fresh.

What's OK: Service. The actual food - it pretty much all tastes the same.

Nothing's bad...it just is a place to eat some OK Mexican food when you want a break from losing your money at the tables."}
{"text":"This is the worst excuse for Mexican food I have ever eaten, and I have eaten the southern cuisine at least twice a month for over 40 years. The food is obviously prepared weeks ahead of time and reheated to serve. The cheese  enchilada was so rubbery it was not edible. The beef enchilada was burned at both ends where it had been microwaved. Don't waste your calories, money or time with this place. Want cheap either!"}
{"text":"I was so surprised that our entrees were not very  good and the staff had an I don't care attitude, like we were bothering him.  Actually our waiter was borderline rude and it wasn't because they were busy because  there were only 2 tables with customers and this was at 8:15pm. I am really surprised that the Orleans allows this because I have been to every restaurant at the Orleans so many times and never received such bad service as well as bad food."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since it was called \"Senior Miguels\".
I am not sure why the name changed to \"Coasta Cantina\" but I will tell you the food is the SAME consistency and quality. It is located inside the Suncoast.

You get started with chips, salsa, and bean dip. All are good. This last visit I decided to try the \"Carne Asada\" and it was soooo good! The meat was full of flavor and that was with them cooking it well done per my request.

On Wednesday and Thursday night they currently have the following special..
Endless Tacos, Enchiladas and Bottomless Margaritas - $9.99 
-Choice of ground beef, shredded beef or chicken tacos
-Choice of cheese or chicken enchiladas with red or green sauce
-Includes flan for dessert

We go for this all of the time you just can't beat it! If you haven't tried this place yet it is a must if you love good Mexican food and not have to pay an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"While on this side of town taking care of some errands, I suggested this place to hubby since we were passing by it anyway. I have eaten here many times in the past but it had been a while so I was curious to see what had changed if anything. 

They now have a \"Coasta Cantina Express\" which is right where you walk in to be seated in the actual restaurant. If you don't want to eat inside this gives you the option to just grab it to-go. I would think you could just order it to-go from inside the restaurant the same but maybe people don't think about that and having the express makes them realize that they want a taco. The express menu is limited compared to the menu inside but has the standard favorites. You can choose tacos, burritos, salads, rice bowls, quesadillas, nachos, soda, water and it wouldn't be Vegas unless they sold beer and they do that too. $4 a beer! Eating inside gets you free chips, salsa & bean dip but if you want it from the express it is going to cost you $3.50 (no beans just chips & salsa) and $1.95 if you want to add rice and beans to your order. 

Now that I was finished being nosy about the express option I decided eating inside would be better for us. We were seated right away and had our drink orders taken. The person bringing us refills was spot on he was quick to refill our chips & salsa or ask if we needed anything but our server lacked a lot of things. It took her 15 minutes for her to even come over and see us and then 5 more minutes until she came back to take our order. We finished 2 rounds of chips & salsa before she came over to us. They weren't very busy at all so I don't know what the deal was. The chips & salsa are good and the bean dip is amazing. It tasted just like I remembered it. When it came to the main course I ordered the \"Cheese Enchiladas\" made with flour tortillas. It came with a side of beans (I know I said it but the beans are so tasty!) and rice. It wasn't terrible at all but it wasn't spectacular. I think it could be due to the fact that the plate wasn't very warm when it arrived. I was able to get it for $7.99 after I showed my players card. Currently if you have a players card then on weekdays before 6 pm you can get a 2 item combo for just $7.99. My meal would have been $11 with out the deal. Score! Hubby ordered a \"Shredded Beef Burrito\" priced at $12 and had it smothered for 99 cents more. He enjoyed it and found the size to be good but again the food was sorta cold. 

This could have been easily given more stars by me if the server did her job and if the food wasn't on the cold side. I will more then likely leave this location to the tourists and stick to the location closer to my home."}
{"text":"My wife and myself have been eating here for many years. The food is good and the servers are always attentive.. Our meals (2/7/15) were tasty and enjoyable. I ordered Chicken El Cortez (14) and my wife had Chicken Azteca (14). The meals had two large chicken breasts on each of our plates which left us stuffed ( one would have sufficed). You get complimentary chips and salsa along with a small cup of Fideo soup.. On holidays and special events it does get busy. But that's the same with all casino restaurants, This one is located in the Orleans. There are lots of Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas but trying to find a good one to suit your taste buds is challenging. Having some ability to speak in Spanish is a plus for you local establishments lets face it. This is a good choice for a nice meal at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for ten years now. They did change their name and until now I haven't been back. The food is still outstanding. The price is great and service is average. Very pleased. I wish they were open 7 days a week and for lunch!"}
{"text":"The fajita special for 2 was a great value.  Margaritas are tasty, but the fajitas were somewhat bland. Dessert was fried banana or ice cream which were both very good"}
{"text":"Customer service is great. So 2 stars for service. 
Food is reheated and lousy. 
I will not come back."}
{"text":"Average Mexican food.  Nothing to write home about.  Chips were good and so were the salsa.  The refried beans were excellent.  So much flavor. 

We started with the Mexican potato skins.  These were really good.  Crispy potato skin with cheese and different meats.  They give you 3 of them, one chicken, one pork, and one ground beef.  The beef one was the best.  The ground beef was really good.  A good amount of spices. 

The wife had a cheese enchilada and a chicken taquito plate.  She liked the enchilada, but didn't like the taquito.  The chicken inside was good, but they really scimped on the size.  They only gave you one.   I ordered the chile relleno and a beef taquito.  I liked the taquito, but the size is just not worth it.  The chile relleno was not good.  It was poblano stuffed with cheese and then an egg batter crusted on the top of it and baked.  So disappointing. 

Overall just an average Mexican restaurant meal."}
{"text":"I would give them a zero if I could based strictly on the customer service quality. We were a group of six who went in with a BOGO coupon created by Coasta Cantina expressly for our convention at the nearby Orleans Arena.  After a lot of needless debate (the coupon was really straightforward, but he tried to make it sound ambiguous), the manager refused to honor the coupon. He also didn't want to push two tables together to allow us to be more comfortable, and opted instead to have 6 of us sit at a small round table. Weird, but we complied with that. This was at 9 PM on a weeknight, so the place was pretty much empty.

There are too many details to include them all in this review, so I'll just sum up with this feedback for management/owners:  own your mistake while we are still at the table, and not after we've already walked out the door. Seat us where we are most comfortable, and not what's most convenient for you (especially when the restaurant is practically empty)."}
{"text":"Come hungry. More food than you could possibly eat.   I had to pass on dessert.  Weekend special 2 for $25  Good salsa, appetizers and service.   Entree was filling but very americanized.  Will still be on the hunt for more traditional Mexican food."}
{"text":"Located in the Orleans Hotel Casino, this is a Mexican restaurant that is pretty laid back not the festive craziness of Senor Frogs. The prices are very good and the food is not bad either. Is it worth a special trip, no. But if you are in the neighborhood, you could certainly do worse, at very least you can get a great Margarita. Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"We did the 2 for $25 (I think it's $25) and the food is really good. There was so much food in the beginning that I couldn't even eat my dinner because I was so full. First there is salsa and bean dip and part of the 2 for deal is an appetizer and my husband chose this sampler which was a dinner itself. The only thing that wasn't that good was the churros for dessert. They were kinda stale and they covered it with chocolate and whipped cream. It sounds good but it didn't taste good.

The employee's are nice and as always it is not a busy restaurant."}
{"text":"Sourly this is a big \"UGH\" review.  Due to a big shopping decision earlier in the day, we ended up here (to save $$) for our 1st Anny dinner, instead of Fogo De Chao.  So the place is located inside the Suncoast Hotel and Casino.  My hubby had previously ate here alone, and wanted me to try it.  I'm a vegetarian, so I'm rather limited at Mexican restaurants, but I browsed their menu and chose the cheese quesadillas app and \"sizzling\" veggie fajita.  Hubby got some mexican platter.  All of our food was below average for the price you pay.  ALL OF IT.  But I could get over that, because I'm used to average mexican food.  So what made this place 1 star?  SERVICE.  Horrendous service.  Our male server, could not give a damn about helping us.  He was absent, slow, and non-friendly.  And we went at 5pm, and the place was only 1/2 full.  He disappeared for long stretches, even when I paid and so we had to wait for the receipt.   We spent over an hour inside, just because of the slow service.  We wanted out, and couldn't because our bill was held hostage!  We'll never be back.  My sizzling fajita was barely edible, UGH.  This place is SUPER UGH."}
{"text":"Really great food service spot on...the Carne asada tacos are stupendous!!!
Margaritas are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican place, and not the worst.  Chips and Salsa to start off are great, with two sauces and beans to enjoy.  I wish they would change up the menu, as there are plenty of other choices they could serve to add some zing to this place.

Staff is always friendly and service has always been good to us.  Food just needs an upgrade in my opinion."}
{"text":"The salsa and bean dip with chips at the beginning is really good.

We came here tonight for $9.99 endless tacos or enchiladas (avail on wed or thurs night) and bottomless margaritas and flan for dessert.  

I chose the chicken enchiladas and had 3 margaritas (yummy), My dinner was very good. Service was average. I had to wait for more salsa that took almost 10 minutes to get. 

I think this special is very good and I would absolutely go back again.  I was actually surprised that their margaritas were really good (choice of traditional or strawberry) and it wasn't just watered down or anything. Even the flan was good."}
{"text":"I had family visiting me, but they preferred hotel accommodations. 
I recommended they stay at the Suncoast because it is the most upscale hotel/casino near my house.
 A long time ago, I ate at this place, but I don't remember anything outstanding or horrible.
If anything, I remember thinking it was pretty good.
Well...The service and the atmosphere are very good, but sadly, the food is not.
The rice was dry, my taco shell was stale, and I tried my cousin's chicken dish, and it was tasteless. 
And, considering that it's a hotel restaurant, the food is overpriced. 
It just doesn't cut the mustard (or salsa)."}
{"text":"My family and I had a reservation for dinner before our show. Our party of 6 was sat down at 6pm. The restaurant was only about half full. It took a full 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our presence. The bus server who finally came by with chips and took our drink order didn't even get the drink order correct. She had to go back for my ice tea. It took another 15 minutes for the waitress to show up. Mind you, we flagged the manager down during this time and he said he would find our waitress and send her over. He didn't. He went back to his stand, completely ignoring our request. After another 15 minutes we did finally get our food...I had the flautas. All I can figure is my order was done first and just sat waiting for everyone elses. It was luke warm and soggy, same thing happened to two other diners in our party as well on completely different dishes. We talked with the Manager again on our way out and he truly didn't care. If you love crappy food and seriously lousy service, go ahead and go there. My family and I sure won't."}
{"text":"The Coasta Cantina is located next to the escalators in the Suncoast Casino.

On Friday, 10/30, we arrived here at 5:30 & found it not very busy or espec. friendly.  I ordered the Coasta Cantina chicken special and my partner had a chicken burrito.  The service was lousy because when more & more people arrived, the 2 servers couldn't handle it all.  Everyone in that dining room waited at least 40 minutes for their food and we were told nothing when we inquired.  The bean dip was horrible and almost cold.  My chicken wasn't pink, but thin & transparent.  The sauce of spinach & mushrooms was only warm, & very mediocre.  The burrito was the smallest I've ever seen on a plate & delivered once again with that pitiful bean dip.  Our server never returned to ask if all was well with our food.

The ambiance was 1950's with huge booths that blocked the lovely tall windows.  The lighting was like hitting George Webb's hamburger parlor at 1:00 am, and there was no music emanating from anywhere (which could have helped the mood for sure).

Las Vegas has a huge population of Mexican restaurants, so how this one gets away with even being open is a mystery."}
{"text":"A year later and they're still my favorite go to place for Tex-Mex! The Ukrainian woman at the front is always such a delight. She remembers my name, and little things we converse about from time to time. Not to mention she always checks on us to make sure we're okay. The food is always fresh and delicious. I've taken many friends there and they love the place as much as I do. Our hat's off to the chef and staff! Gracias!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Any time my wife and I come to vegas we come here. I like the fresh chips with the 3 sides. The food is always good. Service is great. This is the old don miguels. I asked what had changed. Nothing only the name and owner. Staff and cooks are still the same. I like the quality of the food. i am very picky. I have never had a problem in this place."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that we arrived around 845p and later realized they closed at 930p, so it may have attributed to the atmosphere and service.  

We were seated at one of many empty booths but couldn't actually sit down until the booth was cleaned off from the crumbs left behind by the last patrons.  I did notice some stains on the upholstery of the seat, some white smears, that I only hoped could be sour cream from the hands of a small child. 

The chips and salsa were just okay.  The salsa had a nice taste and consistency but the chips looked like they were bought from the store and tasted about the same.  The beans however tasted extremely bland and old, I wouldn't have fed them to a starving dog. 

We ordered and shared the chicken fajitas, which came out sizzling and their presentation was quite nice.  They were served with an additional plate of guacamole, beans, and rice.   The beans looked to be the same as the ones served with the chips, so I didn't try them.  The rice looked okay but didn't taste very good at all, I only could stomach one bite. 

Being that nothing had been very great thus far, I didn't have high expectations for the main dish.  To my surprise, the fajitas were pretty good.  Cooked well and through, the chicken was just right.  The seasoning was good, and the flours were soft and fresh.   If it weren't for these, my rating would have been 1 star.  

The service was rushed and our waiter wasn't at all enthused that we were there; which I'm sure was because it was towards the end of his shift.  We did finish our meal and left well before 930p, though. 

I won't be returning anytime soon and cannot see the restaurant lasting much longer with these types of standards."}
{"text":"Yuck,
In a town with a huge Latino population, why can't the food be just a little bit better?  The only good part of the meal was the chips and salsa.  Don't get the flavored margaritas because mine tasted like mango syrup on the rocks.  Stick to the traditional or just order a beer.  Flavorless and lukewarm food.  Get out of this casino if you want food, I have eaten at the Oyster Bar, Coffee Shop and now here and for some reason the food in all three restaurants is undesirable and barely heated through."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner after seeing Ameriican Sniper at Suncoast theater. Wife ordered Chicken Cortez.  I ordered Tacos Pescardo with shrimp. She said her dish tasted terrible.  Hardly ate any of it.  Tacos dish was just so-so. Skimpy shrimp. Better Mex at other restaurants nearby."}
