{"text":"The banner advertising \"Gourmet Chinese Food\" could not be further from the truth.  I'm shocked that this place has more than 3 stars and isn't out of business yet.  I understand the whole American Chinese food thing and I know we're lacking in great local Chinese food spots... but I'd avoid this place at all costs.  The food was very bland and- more importantly- every dish we ordered came out sitting in a pool of grease.  I have never had pizza this greasy, let alone Chinese food.  I am talking inedible amounts of oil covering the shrimp, noodles, etc.  Even more disturbing was the fact that multiple people working here were coughing and sneezing, including the lady at the front handling takeout orders (who failed to cover her mouth and was sneezing throughout the course of our meal).  Made me wish I worked for the health department.  This restaurant is disgusting, the only reason I don't give it one star is because I didn't get shot or die after eating the food here (meaning I suppose, potentially, it COULD have been worse).  Anyway, the point is I'd never come back."}
{"text":"Stop by this place on a whim.  Ordered the Mongolian Beef and Orange Chicken (white meat, which is nice).  The Mongolian Beef was very tasty.  But the Orange Chicken could use a bit of improvement on the flavor.  They got the order ready at the time they said they would.  Also the corn egg soup was nice and light.  Would definitely go back to pick up food on this place."}
{"text":"Great food. Reasonable price. Best delivery Chinese food around this area. Fast service."}
{"text":"So we are always looking for a great Chinese place here in town as back in Boston we could get authentic food, so we said we'll give them a shot. The fried rice had either risotto or something in it that made it very heavy. They didn't get it ordered right Either and considering we walked in and went over the order 3 times before paying for it, this really shouldn't have been an issue. We won't be going back to many other Chinese food places around town."}
{"text":"This is truly the best authentic place in the valley!!! The manager/hostess/waiter is the friendliest & most accommodating ever! It's definitely a hidden treasure.  We drive from Summerlin to Baidu every chance we get just to enjoy the best tasting Chinese cuisine! And a plus, he somehow happens to remember our usual order, each time! No matter how long it's been between visits! It's the best !!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We always order for delivery and it's here fast and hot, definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews saying this place had veg friendly food, I called to ask if a few items I was interested in were able to be made vegan. I was told \"I don't think so.\" ((CLICK)) THE GUY HUNG UP! Wow, he didn't even ask what items I was calling about. I was shocked and did not bother with them any further."}
{"text":"Not a lot of restaurants can prepare a decent egg foo young but this place is the exception.  The order is big enough to share with 2 -3 friends and the plate is prepared fresh.  Although I can do without the fried rice the rest of the menu is delicious and the food is always piping hot.  Try the chicken with Chinese eggplant for a change."}
{"text":"BBaidu China Bistro provides wholesome, tasty and reasonably priced lunch specials, dinner entrees and appetizers.  They have a daily special.

The meat dumplings (pot stickers) are served either fried or steamed with a wonderful dip.   The tasty hot and sour soup is smooth and full of goodies.  The chicken with string beans has a salty garlic flavor which does not overpower.  Occasionally the salt and pepper pork chops are available, a simple and elegant dish that should not be missed.

I eat at this restaurant about once a week."}
{"text":"I stopped in here in desperate search for a Chinese Restaurant, because the one I frequent closed its location. I'm glad I did! They have the best Hot and Sour Soup I've ever had. They had perfectly fried egg rolls and delicious Orange Chicken. They even had a special order $8.00 worth of food and receive a free drink. I will definately frequent this location. I ordered to go, as in a hurry with work schedule, and I was in and out in less than ten minutes. Courteous and attentive staff, fairly decent seating area, and very clean environment. I will definitely be back.  The only downside is they advertise the BEST ORANGE Chicken and well it was good but it wasn't the greatest, they should advertise their Hot and Sour Soup as the Best in Town, because it is."}
{"text":"My husband and I had been craving Chinese and decided to look up a few places.  After deciding on this one we were greatly disappointed.  The food was mediocre and that's still giving them too much credit.  We ordered over $60 worth of food only to receive 2 orders of burnt chicken wings, dried out cheese rangoon, hard veggie egg rolls, and all of the rest of our food was bland.  There was no seasoning of any sort, needless to say we will never order nor recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"The food was very disappointing. We ordered delivery and there were multiple items left off the order. Their wonton soup contained shrimp which is not listed on the menu. Not an real issue unless you are allergic to shellfish. The fried rice was littered with egg shells, and even after the driver returned with the Egg Drop Soup (forgotten off the order) it was basically water with cornstarch and egg whites added. Over all this was a horrible delivery and experience. There are just to many other restaurants in the area to be buying from them again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have frequented Baidu for a few months now. We have always enjoyed our experience in the restaurant and the food was always good. 

Why I give it a 3 is the lack of consistency. I absolutely loved their fried rice because it was always simple rice with egg and green onions. So I was saddened today when we ordered it and it had different ingredients, carrots and peas and no onion. This may seem like a small thing, but when I order the exact same thing a few weeks apart, I expect them to be the same dish, or I probably wouldn't have ordered it in the first place. 

My other negative comment about Baidu is that their delivery drivers are a bit pushy when it comes to tips. One of them even came back to the door when my fiancé didn't leave a tip on our card (he was unaware that I hadn't added it to our delivery order already). I kid you not, he signed the CC receipt, closed the door, we sat down to eat and this man came back demanding a tip because he \"drove very far\" to deliver our food, we live no more than 4 miles from the restaurant. Now, had my fiancé known I forgot to attach it, he would have given him cash, but for him to come back and demand it from us was just very off putting and we most likely won't order again from Baidu."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food. Their portions are amazing, 2 plates can probably feed up to 4 people. The pricing is great. The food is made to order so you can add or take off ingredients if you like. Service is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years. It's not busy whenever I go in which I like. The service is great. It's always the same guy and he is so nice and gracious! He pretty much runs every table and the whole front! 
The food is really great! Always great soup, love the egg rolls and the sesame chicken was soooo tasty!!! 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, nice food, and fair price. They also have delivery service. You must come."}
{"text":"I order delivery at least once a week, usually more; and have never had a bad experience. The largest criticism I have is that the war won ton soup is not available as part of the lunch special, but a cup of it just wouldn't be enough anyway.  My usual order is the Green Pepper Beef with a bowl (the container is actually about two healthy bowl's worth though) of war wonton soup. 

Also they open at 11, which is perfect if you start your day early or just want an earlier lunch delivered to you."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite Chinese food spot. However, since new management took over I've found it to really taken a drop in quality on some key items. 

Scallion cakes used to be my favorite but now they're super greasy. The minced shrimp lettuce wraps used to be light and super flavorful. Now they're drowned in sauce and barely palatable. Fried wontons are also way greasier than food should be 

The only thing I still enjoy is their Singapore noodles. Although their medium heat is pretty mild. Orange chicken is decent but nothing amazing. 

I miss the tasty, non greasy appetizers. I would order from the more if they went back to that. As is, I'm searching for a new spot for delivery."}
{"text":"The best Chinese on this side of town hands down. The food is pleasantly delightful. Not overly greasy nor do they put layers upon layers of batter with little to no meat like the other places. Customer service is great and they actually serve you including pouring soup into your bowl. I will continue to come here for my Chinese food fix!"}
{"text":"Their Hong Kong style crispy was really good but cheese rangoon might as well have been a dessert (how is this a side?).  Another bummer is the $10 minimum for using a credit card (I added the rangoon to address this minimum charge)."}
{"text":"Had chicken chow mien and lemon chicken. Very good. Prices are good for quality and portion sizes. Interior is nice and clean looking. Will definitely be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"We live right around the corner, so it is very close and convenient.  We go there for lunch or dinner and I have even ordered their party trays for my parties.  Food and service is really great.  Whenever we have the need for Chinese food, we are there!!"}
{"text":"Very good food at very affordable prices.  I recommend the eggplant dish... it's the best eggplant I've had stateside.  The orange chicken is crisp and fresh... I really recommend this for a lunch place.   Haven't tried dinner."}
{"text":"I had the general tso's chicken here with brown rice.  At the time, I was eatting a lot of brown rice so I appreciate that this place has the healthy portion and food option. 

My husband liked his meal as well, and he often says that we should go get chinese food there.

If i were to pick between any of the chinese restaurants in the south side of las vegas I definately would pick this place.  Good food, nice staff, and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this little place! I am a regular check in happy to say. I always order the house fried rice and house chow mein! The shrimp they use here is DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"I've been eating here pretty much since I moved to Vegas, so about 6 years, this place is amazing! I usually get my food to go.  I love that I can get half orders of certain items because I'm usually ordering for myself and I don't have to waste any food. Not that anything is usually wasted because everything is fantastic! My go to and favorite item is the potato chicken, no other place I've been to has it and it is the best thing ever!!!"}
{"text":"The best Chinese food!!! I always get the sesame chicken it's sooo good! Everything is always hot and fresh!! We got free fried wontons last time!"}
{"text":"What I had: Potato Beef lunch special w/ chow mien noodles and a spring roll
TOTAL: $6.76 w/ tax and water

So, I popped into this place for a quick bite and to be honest with you, that's all this place is good for: a cheap, quick bite

I ordered the potato beef lunch special... they gave me water with it... but never even OFFERED to take my drink order... which might be a good thing because they don't actually have a soda machine. They have a cooler with canned sodas in it. It really irks me when restaurants do this and always brings questions to mind like: (1) You can afford to run a restaurant but can't afford a soda machine? (2) If I wanted a canned soda, I'd just drink that at home... or in THIS place's case, just (literally) walk to the pharmacy 10 feet away and buy one for cheaper...

OK, back to the potato beef. I ordered this hoping it would be \"stew-like\"... like the filipinos make which is one of my favorite dishes... IT WAS NOT... This was more like Mongolian (style) beef with some potato slices thrown in... the potatoes were cut crinkle/zucchini style... cheap flavors and nothing to write home about.

The free spring roll that came with it was probably that pre-made crap from the grocery store... which I'm beginning to suspect ALL their ingredients come from the Wal-Mart or Smith's nearby. I suspect this because this place is right next to a cool butcher shop... but when I asked the manager if they got their meat from the butcher next door, he said \"No, we get it from another store\".... he specifically said STORE... not a meat packaging or distribution place like the GOOD Chinese restaurants do.

The free appetizer with the lunch special was \"corn egg soup\"... they literally called it that... I've always heard it called egg drop soup... this one was pretty bland with no green onions added... and it seemed to be much thicker than what other Chinese restaurants have.

Overall, the entire meal was BLAND... despite how cheap it is, I would suggest someone go to Panda Express if they're looking to go the cheap route... but if you want some REALLY TASTY Chinese food... in bigger portions... check out China-A-Go-Go (multiple locations) or China Tango Bistro (in Green Valley)"}
{"text":"Wow what happened here? This was my go to Chinese food place but today's pick up was the most dry stale food I've ever had. The noodles in the chow mein dry and almost hard as if been sitting out since yesterday's leftovers. Even the egg rolls were stale, the lettuce/cabbage whatever they use was old crunchy and brown like it had been sitting out for days and then microwaved. Terrible just terrible I'm sad I paid for this"}
{"text":"This is our Chinese food standby, the only place we trust. Sometimes they forget things, but 80% of the time the order is great with no problems. The front desk is pretty good about understanding what I am saying over the phone. Their delivery is pretty quick although they can't seem to operate our gate, and dine-in is very nice. We like the older gentleman that waits on us when we go in, he is so nice :)"}
{"text":"I love this place!! The service is always very friendly, it's always quiet in there and the food is amazing. Ignore the typos in their menu tho, lol. I love the orange chicken and the cheese Rangoons. They also delivery very quickly and efficiently. This has become my favorite hole in the wall Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"I think the main reason I'm giving it a bad review is the fact that their cleanliness is problematic. I had the manager, I think, who handed us our plates with is thumb well onto the plate after we had just watched him cleaning with his hands. No hands washed."}
{"text":"This place is so good when you're starving. Huge portions and they have great coupons. I've never had a bad meal here and I'm a picky vegetarian. They know me now. They know what I want b4 I sit down!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here and the fact that they deliver is also why I am loyal to this restaurant.  If I feel to lazy to drive over there, I know I will get the same delicious food delivered quickly to my house and it will be still hot.  

Prices are reasonable and the service is friendly, we love the fried rice and tofu dishes.  There is a lot of variety for vegetarians."}
{"text":"I thought I had found my go to Chinese place in Vegas, and I was once again wrong. I've gone several times to Baidu and was pretty happy with the orange chicken or the soup, yesterday I dared to order the honey walnut chicken... BIG mistake. It was absolutely disgusting, the \"chicken\" (if indeed that thing was chicken) was beyond rubbery, I was chewing Chinese gum with nasty sauce. I'm gagging as I'm typing this. The search for amazing Chinese in Vegas continues, this is without a doubt not it."}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese restaurant that delivers to my house.
It's got the basic menu and they're more than willing to augment a dish to suit your preferences.
For example, I like Moo Goo Gai Pan, which is not normally spicy, but I ask them to spice it up, and they comply.
They have family specials, but on those, they are not too keen on changing the choices.
They deliver really fast, and have never made me wait more than 15 or 20 minutes for delivery.
I would recommend ordering from the regular menu, and stay away from the family specials.
They may seem like they're a good deal, but I don't like when my choices are made for me.
I love their pot stickers (although they are pretty expensive), and I like their beef and broccoli, War Wonton soup, and spicy shrimp w/vegetables.
The food is pretty good, and the delivery is fast, but the prices are a little high."}
{"text":"We live very close by...very close...when we call for delivery seriously from the time we call till it is at our door.....maybe 15 minutes WOW!

This place is authentic Chinese to me, hands down. Their beef moo shu is EXACTLY like our fav San Fran Chinatown place.

The Orangie Chicken is very good, not fake tasting, real oranges :) that's how the guy repeats it on the phone, so cute :)

Our fav is veggie chow mein, no water chestnuts, and add fresh garlic :))))) sooo good!

Their Singapore Mai Fun is very good, their Vegan dumplings are awesome! Check their website and they have just about everything. 

Sometimes I get veggie fried brown rice with cashew nuts!!!! Sooo yummy!!!

We add and subtract certain ingredients and I was scared at first but they totally dig it!!! They don't seem put off and the food is ALWAYS flaming hot in heat and totally right!

Super sweet and even when dining in, they are quick and the place is very clean.

ORDER SOME NOW :)"}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant. I was greated right away when I walked in the door and was given a booth really quickly. Ordering my food was quick and they didn't take long to serve me a hot plate. I ordered the Chicken Teriyaky and the rice was a bit dry for my taste. I asked for water once and the lovely server was on top of her game. I never had the chance to ask for a Refill of water, because she always stopped by to fill my glass. Parking was really good for a Wednesday after 5pm. Be sure to try their Bobs Tea's."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and I was trying to think of a way I could at least give it 2 stars because the delivery guy was very sweet and who knows maybe their chicken or shrimp is better. Their beef however, was not. I ordered Szechuan Beef and what I got was a container full of fried onions and something that looked like pulverized rubbery meat. In fact it was almost like eating gristle or fat and it kind of disintegrated in your mouth. It had no taste at all. It was bland and had no flavor, no spice ( I ordered it medium spicy) I'm not sure what they do to their beef as my friend had the Mongolian Beef and it was clearly prepared the same way...beat to hell and cooked to a mush. Our dishes looked exactly the same and tasted exactly the same even though we ordered two different dishes. He at least got some green onions in his. Neither one of us could eat more than 3 bites and it went into the trash. I hate wasting food but it just wasn't good and I didn't feel comfortable eating it. Oh and we only got one container of white rice, not sure why we didn't get two and the cheese rangoon was alright. The sweat and sour sauce tasted like ketchup with some sugar syrup added. What happened here? The best part of the meal was the fortune cookie which contained 3 of the same fortunes. I guess I'm going to have to keep looking."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Baidu China Bistro, we had a waitress that was excellent, her name was Ping. We had the cheese ran goons for Appetizers and the vegetarian egg rolls both were very good. For meals, we had, Moo Goo Pan and Egg Foo Young w/Pork and again meals were really good! Also Delivery is excellent. We strongly recommend this restaurant! We rate this restaurant 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The best place so far that I've found in this area of town. The fried rice is good, the Orange chicken is the bomb and I really like their cashew chicken too! BONUS: They deliver! Yea, it's so difficult to find a place that delivers."}
{"text":"Chinese food is easily my favorite. When I moved out to Vegas, there weren't all that many options as far as delivery is concerned. Baidu was decent but far from being actually good, but it had 1 thing that the other places didn't: steamed meat dumplings.

The steamed meat dumplings are my favorite and theirs were above average. For years I would continue to order regularly mostly to get the dumplings despite the lower quality to the many other Chinese delivery options that have since opened up near me.

As time went by, I ordered more infrequently as ordering solely for the one dish wasn't what I wanted to do and getting higher quality proteins and vegetables from other places was preferable, but I would still order for the steamed dumplings from time to time.

Tonight I ordered and the food was particularly below average. They forgot the sauce in a dish where that is critical to it being edible. But the real reason I'm finally writing this review and why I won't be ordering again: the steamed meat dumplings are no longer \"real\". They actually served me the same frozen crap you can buy at any Albertson's and microwave yourself.

I have no reason to come back for far below average food and fake dumplings. Thanks for the memories."}
{"text":"Such great Chinese food!!! Omg I love everything I have ever tried here. My favorite is the orange chicken (so basic). Their fried rice is so good too & so is the chow mein. Not only that, but the owners are sooo sweet. Great food & customer service; you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"This is a good place for a family meal, quiet environment and delicious food, and good service. The recommended food is crispy beef and walnut shrimp. Try it You will know.have a good dinner time with my family"}
{"text":"I found Baidu China Bistro after a major pregnancy craving for Chinese kicked in. I wasn't in the mood to drive all over town in search for some good take-out, so I narrowed the search down to restaurants that delivered. After perusing some menus, I decided on Baidu. I called and had a little difficulty understanding the guy on the other end of the phone, but after some repeating I got my order in. He quoted me a 35 min wait time. Sure enough, 30 minutes later there was a knock on my door and my food was waiting. 

The food was delicious and exactly what I was craving! Not to mention, the price was reasonable. If you live within a 3 mile radius the delivery charge is just $2. Anything over that mileage and it's an extra buck. We were right on the cusp of that, but they ended up just charging me $2. 

I will definitely be ordering from Baidu again!"}
{"text":"I was trying place a delivery order and WOW the person on the phone couldn't even speak english!!!!  How am I supposed to order food if they can't even understand what I am saying.  I'm not tyring to be racist, but come on!  Get someone that can speak English and understand English to take the order!!!  I repeated my phone number and my address 10 times and she still coudn't get it!!  I even spelled it out and she still couldn't get it!!!!  Please put someone on the phone that speaks English!"}
{"text":"fairly new to the rainbow robindae area and i was glad we came across baidu china bistro they are very nice people in the phone and delivery, and their food is tastey, and yummy, not bland like some other chinese food spots. spicy orange chicken is awesome, and their spicy eggplant n tofu is delish! definately our Go-To Chinese place from now on.. ;)"}
{"text":"We rarely go to the restaurant itself but when we do it is always a great experience. The staff are friendly and the owner sometimes brings out an extra desert for the kids. We ALWAYS order the orange chicken, usually for delivery. One of the best orange chicken recipes I have ever tasted. A great place if you want a solid Chinese meal."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place because the rest of the Chinese food near me is gross! My family & I decided to get an array of things. We got Fried Rice, Orange chicken, Chow Mein, & Honey Walnut shrimp. 

So my first pet peeve, I did a delivery order it took an hour and a half to get to me. Then as we started to dig in and eat we all had the same looks on our faces. The fried rice was not cooked all the way and still hard. The Chow Mein was burnt(& tasted that way too) Oh did I mention the orange chicken was under cooked and gummy? Yeah, NOT what I expected at all! Needless to say $50 went down the drain and my family and I ended up ordering pizza. WHOMP! The best Chinese food in Vegas was in the Gold Coast Casino at the Monterrey Room, but now that's been replaced by disgusting TGI Fridays. WHOMP again! Oh well I guess my search of good Chinese food continues."}
{"text":"I had the beef broccoli and my brother had pepper steak lunch special, my wife had the beef phad Thai noodle., everything was delicious and the waitress was so friendly., I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"What a great find. After a day in the heat I was struck by the need for chinese food.

Thanks to the positive Yelp reviews I settled on Baidu China Bistro. Nice comfortable atmosphere, relaxing music in an air conditioned restaurant...did I tell you it was a sweltering 106 today...!!!

Very nice young lady sat me and took my drink order. After looking through the menu I decided upon the chicken lettuce wrap, hot & sour soup, and chicken chop suey w/o the rice. 

My meal was delivered prompt, hot & tasty. So tasty that if there wasn't anyone nearby that could have noticed...I could have licked the plate. It was awesome.

Guess what? This is a family business...go check them out and show your support. Excellent all around...!!!"}
{"text":"It's actually a shame, since we have been going here for years. The food used to be terrific, but the past 2 times we have ordered, the quality has gone down. Chicken hard and over cooked. Egg rolls flavorless and smaller. Tofu soggy & over sauced and too thick. The place itself is beginning to look very run down. Has the health department been in lately? I actually called to share the info & being a longtime customer was shocked I never received a call back. It's very sad. Suppliers change, management changes, but usually for the better....in this case it's for the worse. Onto a new Chinese restaurant!!"}
{"text":"The food was as expected, tasty but nothing I would crave specifically from this place. (Besides the Egg Fu Young, because they made it pretty great!)

The customer service grows on you though. Initially the older gentleman who took our order was short with us and couldn't understand our questions. (We asked for steamed veggies instead of rice sides, but he kept saying no.) Each time the man came back to the table, he seemed more and more pleasant. We heard him whistling while cleaning up other tables and was so merry by the time we left. He was just a sweet old man. 

Fits the typical local fast Asian food spot everyone has, and I will most likely come back."}
{"text":"As health-conscious vegetarians, we are always leery of trying new places. But we are glad to have taken the chance at Baidu China Bistro. I had read previous reviews about the staff, so I was prepared for the older gentleman who waited on us (clearly the owner). I was pleasantly surprised when I asked him to modify a menu item for my vegan diet, he was accommodating and helpful, mentioning that he, too, was vegetarian. The Singapore Mei Fun (rice vermicelli noodles) was amazing with fried tofu and the signature curry rice noodles...and he even returned to the table after we ordered to ask if egg was okay in the dish, which I had not assumed would be in there, and was so glad he thought to ask. My fiance had the Vegetable Chow Mein, which he loved, saying it was very flavorful and not greasy, as is often the case with chow mein. We will be back, and soon, happy to have added a delicious locally-owned neighborhood restaurant to our repertoire."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese fast food in town. I haven't been to a lot but this place definitely is at the top of my list. It's not necessarily even fast food because they put a little more effort into a simple fried rice dish. And I can ask for light oil or special request and they always honor it with no problems. I love the friendly staff. The price is very good and parking is easy. Very highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Me and the fam have been going here for 4 years.  Some of the best chinese I've had to date.  We get the same dishes and they have been consistent the entire time (general tso, mongolian chicken, and potato beef).  Pricing is outstanding.  The 5 of us eat and get our fill for less than $40 plus tip.  Customer service is top notch.  The waiter recognizes us every time we walk through the door and gives us the royal treatment.  Place is kept very clean also.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First time here and I am kind of upset about that. First I will say the owner is really nice. The place is very clean with a little clutter in the back but that is probably because of lack of storage. Their menu is professionally done and really stands out.

Now to the important stuff, the food. We ordered two appetizers, Cheese Rangoon and Pepper Calamari. They were both delicious and the Calamari stood out the most because I really liked the chopped up sauteed peppers and onions served on top of it. I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and my wife ordered the Beef with Broccoli. The General's chicken was one of the best I have ever had. It was very crispy with great taste. I asked for it to be extra spicy and it could of been spicier but I want complain about that. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice, both times consistent and fresh. Good flavors and the vegetables are quality - no babycorn or water chestnut fillers in the noodle dishes. Very clean, spotless dishes. (sounds weird but it is notable)

Food: The Singapore Mei Fun was great, as were the Chicken w/Garlic Sauce and the wildcard: a 1/2 order Orange Chicken Combo Special (6.95 and the size of a full order at any other Chinese restaurant) which comes with broccoli, a spring roll and your choice of rice. Brown rice is available for an extra $1. 

Service: Absolutely everyone I've interacted with at this restaurant is really cheerful and helpful, the waitstaff filled our water glasses at least 5 times over the course of our last lunch there - not so much because we were parched, but because our glasses were 2/3rds full of ice. They could make their job easier by putting less ice in their water glasses but they choose not to cut that corner and for that reason I think service at Baidu China Bistro is exceptional. 5 stars for service. You can tell there is good management here - the morale seems to be very high. No grumpy chefs slamming their woks down on the burner here!

Nice to find another good Asian eatery in the SW corridor when we need to run to Party City or Best Buy down on Rainbow/215."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from this place twice. My first experience wasn't the best but my second was amazing! The delivery was fast and the food was super hot. I ordered orange chicken, potato beef and shrimp with black bean sauce. The orange chicken has good flavor but slightly dry. The potato beef dish was also very good. It's highly recommended for kids especially because the meat and potatoes are soft and easily chewable. My kids loved it. My favorite dish was the shrimp with black bean sauce. The shrimp and vegetables in this dish just taste so fresh and delicious. I almost forgot about the crab ragoon. It has a generous amount of filling and also very tasty!"}
{"text":"I work next door and never knew this place was here. Although I am new to the area. Having that said this place is awesome! They delivered to me even though I'm right next to them. They were very nice over the phone, had fast delivery time and the food is better than I was expecting. Love this place. Def be back soon! Thank you guys!! Xoxo"}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas! All of their food is full of flavor. Service is quick and efficient. Definitely worth a try :)"}
{"text":"Ordered from Post Mates here the other night. It was actually pretty good. It arrived fast. However, it did arrive without 2/3 items on the list I ordered and paid for. 

I Ordered:

Scallion pancakes - Looked good. However, sadly they were never delivered.

Rangoons - Again, sadly these were never sent 

Lemon Chicken - not sure what was going on here with it. They sent Chicken Katsu....with a side of lemon sauce. Fail

Sweet and Sour Chicken - dried Fried balls of chicken with a side of sauce. Pass.

Fried Rice - Not my favorite

Beef Chow Fun - Meh 

Chicken lo mein - not bad just not great

Orange Chicken - Really good. They use white meat!

Generals Chicken - Really good. White meat!

Sesame Chicken - Really good. White meat.

Fortune cookies - meh

Overall - pretty good. Not great"}
{"text":"Quaint eatery. Service is great and the food is extremely fresh. I've eaten here several times and have never been disappointed. Family style meal was $25 for two and the helpings were generous."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved up here from California last week, and we found this place on Yelp. 
Hands down, this was the best food we have ever had!!! 
It was made with real chicken, like you can see it with every bite you made. Plus it was not greasy at all. The customer service was amazing. He was so nice and would always full our cups without asking. Hands down, best food and customer service ever. This from now on, will be our to go place. Thank you again."}
{"text":"We ordered the sesame chicken with fried rice and chicken egg rolls.  The order was early,  the food was hot,  and it tasted great!"}
{"text":"I've never ate at the restaurant but have ordered for delivery quite a few times.  The lady taking my order is well understood compared to other chinese restaurants.  The broccoli beef, combination chowmein, and shrimp in lobster sauce are our faves here.  Very delicious.  Delivery is quick too."}
{"text":"I usually love this place , this time absolutely terrible rice was crunch. orange beef was chewing and the garlic chicken had no flavor very disappointed threw everything out"}
{"text":"Love Baidu.  They have a good lunch menu with $5.95 and $6.95 specials.  

Its family run and I come here enough that the owner knows I don't like a lot of things so he lets me special order my plates.  He'd rather you don't waste something you don't like so you can request specific veggies with your order.

They'll take good care of you."}
{"text":"I mean its Chinese takeout so honestly my expectations are always really low......but i am now just mad at myself that i spent 20$ on almost inedible food ....i ordered delivery and got the calamari (which does not travel well i know, but i had a taste for it) so it was a little mushy but more annoying it didn't have any flavor at all i would go as far as to say it was frozen......and the Mongolian beef was NOT spicy like it says , and it was kinda of slimy texture ....i dunno man maybe it was just my experience but if your in this area and want Chinese takeout i know for a fact theres better places than this one.....i believe in second chances so ill try again because it has 4 stars  but i  gotta say i dont think there will be much change : /"}
{"text":"It's a shame I had to give them a star just so I could rate them. This was a horrible almost deadly experience, literally. My husband and I ordered online through yelp for pickup. We ordered chicken fried rice with no peas or carrots, Mongolian beef, war wonton soup and crab Rangoon. 

My husband goes and picks it up and the lady says \"this was ready 25 minutes ago\" ummm when we ordered, it said 45 minutes to an hour plus you have my number but whatever...

As I started eating my soup, I immediately noticed it had no flavor at all but semi edible. 

My husband begins eating the chicken fried rice and immediately says \"look at this\" I was confused at first cause it didn't look like chicken but it was raw literally raw uncooked slimy ewww. 

I call up there and tell them I will return their rice and I need a refund as they could have killed someone as they have me on hold I look at the Mongolian beef and break a piece off but it was to gummy to tear because it too was raw!!!!

She told me to keep everything and she was calling eats24 to refund me. We hang up and throw EVERYTHING in the garage can outside. 

She then calls me back to tell me \"never mind I need you to bring the food back\" by this point I'm furious. I explained it's in the trash and I asked you and you said no! We went back and forth and finally being sarcastic she states \"ok you make big deal for nothing I'll get your money back don't sue\" and laughs. 

Stay away or get really sick"}
{"text":"Awesome food, fast service and reasonable priced for what you get. The family meal is also a good choice as well."}
{"text":"My only experience with this restaurant is thru Uber Eats; it's been fantastic! I particularly like the minced chicken lettuce wraps and chicken fried rice. Also had the barbecued pork which was OK. The brown rice is good with soy sauce. Steamed dumplings are also very good."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  Orange Chicken and Sesame Chicken were way below average.  No vegetables..just heavily breaded, heavily sauced, fried chicken.  I guess I could say the Orange Chicken did taste like Orange..and the Sesame Chicken did have Sesame seeds on it.  so..if that's what you want, then that's what you'll get.  I did like the spring rolls..they were the best part of the meal.

Save your health neighbors..go to the Volcano Grill.  Fresh meat, and vegetables grilled without breading, without heavy sauces.  A variety of fresh made sauces.(yum yum sauce!!) a much better, tastier, healthier option.
I love your typical heavy fried Chinese dishes...but after eating that very ordinary food...I was pretty mad at myself.  Won't happen again."}
{"text":"Ordinarily, I hate rice...the taste, smell and consistency.  It's actually a subject of contention with my friends as they think it's ridiculous that there's a person in existence that refuses to go to Chinese food places because of this fact.  So, for the most part, I avoid Chinese food and takeout of similar genre, because a side item is always going to be rice.

With that said, I love this restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, I still won't eat their rice, but I do always get the General Tso's Chicken and it is the best that I have ever had.  Also, their cream cheese rangoons are amazing!

In addition to their great food, they are the nicest people that work at and run this establishment.  As somebody that generally avoids Asian food, I whole-heartedly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What on God's earth is wrong with Las Vegas???? It seems as if none of these people can cook!!! This by far is the WORST Chinese food I have ever had!
I ordered shrimp fried rice.  Who can mess up shrimp fried rice I thought.
Well this place did.  The fried rice was dried out and I paid for 7 Shrimp with a whole container of rice.  Where I come from there are shrimp throughout ALL of the rice.  So basically I paid for a large container of dried out rice with shrimp that was barely there.  Seriously???? I'm about to give up dining here because I keep getting disappointed.     THIS FOOD IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!! Panda Express is better than this!  Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Vegas. Great Midwestern Chinese food. Great staff, great food, great prices"}
{"text":"The fried  rice was just rice with soy sauce no veggies egg yolk.  Egg drop soup was bad,  it tastes like water with egg drops no flavoring at all, don't go here."}
{"text":"As American Chinese restaurants go Baidu is pretty good. It's conveniently located right across the street from where I live and is a little less \"junk foody' than a lot of the Americanized Chinese food I have encountered since coming here from Australia. (US Chinese food is, I feel, a few notches more Westernized than what we got back home).

I particularly like their Orange Chicken and Beef Chow Fun, though the \"sweet and sour\" dishes can be a little oddly textured and over-battered for my taste.

Overall though the food here is great, I just wish the menu had a larger selection."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.
The waitress had no idea what was In the plate, what's the different between the noodle types and wasn't patient although we were the only customers in the restaurant. 
The food was gewy and swimming in sauce, unchewable and weird flavour. 
Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some good standard Americanized Chinese fare, this is your place.  Though not particularly \"authentic\", it gets the job done.  $32 with tax for 3 items of take out for lunch.  With a local mailer coupon, one also can get a free order of chicken chow mein!  They also have very inexpensive weekday lunch specials if you are living or working in the area during the week.

The food is prepped when ordered, so if you are impatient when taking out, call ahead.  Otherwise, hang out at the butcher next door and check out the meats while you wait.

The dine in option looks decent enough for a casual meal.  Nothing fancy, but tastefully decorated."}
{"text":"Best quick Chinese food I could find in Vegas. Always get delivery from here. For fast Chinese I love it. Food good and staff nice. They have online ordering that is set up sweet. We have account that remembers our order. I love that!  Recommendations: Orange Chicken, Chow Fun, and Mongolian beef are a must.  The food is not greasy and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"So I went to this place for the first time with a good associate of mine am I have to say it was pretty yummy.

I am pretty picky when it comes to Chinese food but my associate suggested a pretty cool place. The customer service was great and the cost after all the yummy food was gone was not bad either..

I was simple and ordered the shrimp tempura my associate ordered the lettuce wraps which were to die for and than we ordered the orange chicken with a side of rice which was also to die for because not everyone rice is good, so after its all said and done my experience was good!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Chinese food.   They deliver fast!  They might tell you 15 to 30 minutes, but it won't take that long. 

The food is always fresh and hot.   

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a local Chinese take out place close by.  Baidu China Bistro is mine.  Its right across the street from my place, so it's where I go when I want Chinese.

The veggies are always fresh and the service is fast and friendly.  I when you call them, it seems like they are at your door within 15-20 minutes of ordering.  Their food has always been consistently good and the prices aren't too bad."}
{"text":"Husband took us to dinner here Friday. He's a usual during the week for lunch. We however have never been as a family until then. The older man is such a sweetheart. He was immediately on top of anything we needed. My sons ordered two bowls of soup. Huge bowls!! Like mixing bowl size. My 8 year old ordered a cup of soup which was no ordinary cup. It was more like bowl lol. I ordered orange chicken, beef and broccoli, combo fried rice, combo chow mein. Orange chicken was off the hook! Cooked perfectly. Beef and broccoli was so much beef. That's the way beef and broccoli should be made. The rice and noodles were deviously! We even ordered another combo rice to take home. We couldn't finish all of our. The older gentleman packed everyone's food up and bagged it. He even added more broth to my daughter's soup because she drank it all (for free). For being an old guy, he was on top of everything! Never had to ask for a refill. Our glasses were always full. 
 A lot of switch workers are regulars here. Lunch must be a hit because the food is excellent! I have absolutely zero complaints. Recommend this joint to anyone who enjoys authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"They don't have BBQ Pork? Really? 
$3 delivery fee

no thanks"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out, and when I got home I realized that my cashew chicken, was made with peanuts!! I didn't think the food was good at all...the egg rolls were extremely greasy, and so were the noodles...I will not eat here again...sad, because it is close to my house."}
{"text":"I got my order to go and they gave alot of food, all of the dishes tastse great l. I definitely gonna comeback and order some more"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food I have ever eaten. It is clean and hygienic. It tastes very good."}
{"text":"I consider this place my whole in the wall even though by no means is it one but I love the fact that the owners are always there and super friendly, they always remember me and sit me at \"my table\". Second to my love of Pizza is my love of great Chinese food and this is my place. It super affordable, it's really quick, and the flavors are spot on for me. I love their cream cheese won tons, their chicken spring rolls and dumplings are really really good. I a personal big fan of their fried rice and my favorite items are the Mongolian beef, orange chicken, shrimp with lobster sauce, hot and sour soup. I haven't been there and not been happy when I left."}
{"text":"After my dental visit, we got hungry and Roland was in the mood for chinese noodle soup.  We went to Rice N Noodle, but after looking at the menu, the noodle are the chow mein/lo mein, and not the noodle soup that he was looking for.  Then he spotted Baidu, in which there was a big sign \"Gourmet Chinese Food\" so I gave a nod of approval to  stop and look at the menu.  When we walked into the restaurant, it looked decent.  However, after looking at the menu, it's freakin' american chinese!  Dang it!  Because we were pressed for time, we just had to grab a quick bite here.

Roland ordered a crappy soup with noodle...oh wait, it's the house special soup with noodle, and sure was special, specially horrendous.

When I go to this kind of american chinese places, I order the orange beef.  Hot Wok always let me order the orange beef lunch portion, but when we asked if we may order this here, the response was \"not possible.\"  Whatevs.  I ended up ordering the safest choice I could find that I may enjoy, the crab rangoons.  Even then, they were crappy. The cream cheese was not creamy.  

The only positive thing about my lunch experience here was the waitress.  She was quite nice, but never again will I come back."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Chinese place to order from! Their Cream Cheese Rangoons are second to none!!! They are always quick, and everything is fresh. We often request alterations and they are always great with meeting our requests. Love the app ordering option for delivery!"}
{"text":"My Mongolian beef looked? delicious but tasted terrible. I was excited to try this restaurant but I don't think I'll be going back or if I do I definitely won't be ordering anything with beef. They apparently use a low quality beef if you can even call it that it's more like pieces of beef fat. I couldn't even eat it so it was a total waste of $10"}
{"text":"It's a good place to get some chinese food. The place offers plenty of seating for casual dining. I ordered mine to go. I ordered the sweet and sour chicken with brown rice. I love the fact that they offer brown rice here and also a special low calorie selection of food as well. Their egg corn soup was also delish. It was filled with a good amount of egg and corn for you to enjoy. The ingredients in my sweet and sour chicken meal were all fresh and hot.

Their service is also wonderful. They are very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Third time I ordered Kung Pao that came with \"zero\" peppers and flavor was weak.  The Hot n Sour soup had no meat, mushrooms, bamboo shoots and tofu...just broth.  I've been eating here for three years, but in my opinion this food is fastly moving in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"Disapppointing.  Everything was just meh. Pineapple fried rice is literally fried rice w pineapple. Ordered it w tofu instead of shrimp based on a note found saying it came w shrimp. Not Thai pineapple fried rice like how some places have Thai style rice. Duck is dry and hardly any meat on it. We've ordered this from another place and it's amazing. Not the case here. Chow fun meat was eh. Potstickers meat was strange not like it went bad but like an odd choice. Will not order again. Two stars for promptness."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant anywhere. It's reasonably priced and the food and service are great every time. The wonton soup is the best I've ever tasted. No box Chinese restaurant food here. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I compare Chinese food based on the scale of Panda Express. If it is better than Panda Express then it is really good. Far worse than Panda and it is crap. So far all the Chinese restaurants have not been better than Panda Express and this place is no different! I tend to stick with Thai food. The flavors far exceed Chinese food. Still in search of a great Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Horrible. General tsao chicken way over fried. Mongolian beef is basically onions with  a brown sauce with no flavor.  It's real hard to fuck up Chinese food.  But they found a way to do it.  Never again. 50 bucks in the garbage disposal."}
{"text":"We love their family dinner meals. We order the spicy orange chicken and the honey walnut shrimp, egg drop soup and we get the 6pcs crab rangoon as bonus items :), great delivery, only $2 charge!"}
{"text":"Well we are here waiting for our takeout
and a cockroach crawls across the counter where the register is.  We won't be back
I guess we're out $40.00"}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite Chinese food... the food was amazing. So fresh and hot. The hot and sour soup is definitely my favorite. I love that they deliver. And my food is always properly secure and hot! My kids love the food! That's all that matters in the end, enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"Finally found a good Chinese restaurant that delivers! Originally being from Cali, I've been looking for a more familiar style of this type of food (basically, not panda express). The fact that they deliver is a bonus! I ordered sweet n sour chicken and chicken chow mein. Delivery took the 35 minutes they said. Food was good, warm. Sauce for chicken, a bit spicy how I like it. When placing phone order, the employee spoke very clearly also and enunciated well. Personal pet peeve of mine when you call a place and the person on the other end talks as fast as possible. I will definitely order from Baidu again."}
{"text":"I've lived in Las Vegas for a while  &  if I had to pick something I truly missed it would be good Chinese food,  week  Baidu has some of the best Chinese food around.  I took my parents  out to dinner &  we all really liked it  We started with the Wor Wonton Soup & then had  Sesame Chicken,  Beef Chow Fun &  Shrimp &  Lobster Sauce.  The meal came with  Fried Rice which was dark in color  &  very  tasty.  Everything was very good.  The service was good,  although language was a small issue.  The prices are very reasonable.  Thankfully it's nearby so we can visit often."}
{"text":"Two-and-a-half stars get bumped to three because, come on, we all have to have our go-to, barely-above-average neighborhood Chinese food joint. This one is ours. Comments about greasiness are, unfortunately, accurate. We decided to stop ordering the scallion pancake because it would show up soaked through with grease. More flimsy thank flakey. And Sichuan green beans come rather more sauced than is necessary. But I'm a fan of the ginger chicken, and chow mein and fried rice plates hit the sweet spot of what you know and love about American Chinese food. Chicken wings are pleasantly crispy with a bit of pepper infused heat. And so on. In all, very few surprises here, either positive or negative. Take comfort in the averageness."}
{"text":"I'm with Lori M. This place used to be a mainstay. We had the hot and sour and it is stilll great. But the general tsos was so overcooked they were rock hard, and one entree came crushed with bits of broken plastic in the food somewhere. I guess the new management is just not on top of their game."}
{"text":"Yuck..salty, no real flavor to the food and customer service from the lady at the front wasn't friendly. I won't be going here again. I will be going elsewhere for Chinese food. Sucks cause this place is so close to my house."}
{"text":"Skewer chicken was fried and kind of hard (rather than grilled) but the honey walnut shrimp and lemon chicken were very good and the Mongolian beef was ok. It arrived very quickly and hot!"}
{"text":"Solid place for some really decent Chinese food. No matter how you order, dine in, take out, delivery, you get the food fast and the service is extremely friendly. They remember my girlfriend and I every time we come in or order, so it's nice to know they pay attention to their patrons. 

We tried a variety of dishes, and in my opinion the best food they have is: Combination Chow Mein, Singapore Mei Fun, Chicken and Broccoli, and Shrimp with Broccoli. Each dish has very nice flavors for what they are. The advertise their orange chicken as the best. While it IS good, it's very similar to other places, so don't expect your palette to be in a state of orgasm. 

Cheap, solid, and delicious for what you pay for. The only downside is that their healthy options are limited, albeit they have a special menu for healthy people, such as only steamed chicken/shrimp with veggies. 

Before I forget, they DO have brown rice upon request, which is the healthier option, but bland."}
{"text":"Wasn't happy about the food. I got general Tso's chicken. It was too sweet, not at all spicy or have a kick to it. The chicken was so dry it almost tasted like not chicken. The fried rice tasted like rice with soy sauce not egg in it either. Won't visit this place again. First try and had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Twice now I have ordered online and failed to receive the coupon special offered. I asked for the manager but he just stared at me and told me they did not know their own specials online, so they could not help. I told him that was poor business practices. He offered no apology and I will not return!"}
{"text":"Great chinese food!! Great, attentive, prompt service. We had the spring rolls, sesame chicken, and hong kong pan fried noodles. Very reasonable prices. We will definately be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We've decided the green pepper beef and chicken with garlic sauce are our favorites. We've been numerous times and have not been disappointed. We also usually get egg drop soup and steamed rice. One of the things we enjoy most is that the vegetables are never over cooked but are still brightly colored and al dente, if you will. In addition, the food is not drenched in the sauces but has has generous amounts. And, to top it off, the service is always superb!"}
{"text":"Steamed vegetables w chicken and shrimp- great. 

Chicken skewers - aren't even chicken. The most disgusting choice of animal I've even seen. Wouldn't even feed it to my bulldog. 

Shrimp lettuce cups- no shrimp, some brown juice with minced vegetables. Gross af and threw it out

When a place is so cheap they can't even give you napkins or utensils, you know they must cut costs at every corner and you're taking a chance w your personal health by eating it. 

Roadkill is better than this."}
{"text":"I've ordered here enough over the years to determine that I will probably be disappointed.  First of all, I'm not accustomed to greasy shrimp fried rice or greasy cheese rangoon.  Where I'm from, it's called crab rangoon and I certainly miss it.  

I can no longer waste my money here and I've yet to find a decent Chinese spot near my home."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. It did arrive quite fast, but was so dry that I ended up throwing most of it away. Unfortunately I wont try Baidu again."}
{"text":"I've been searching for their spring rolls ever since I came to Vegas! Six years later I finally found the ones I've been craving! The Orange Chicken as good, as well as the General Zso's. Next time I'll try the medium spicy, for the first time I tried the mild it there was just a soft zing so I'll be a bit braver next time I order."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! 
When we don't want to cook, their delivery saves the day. 
Our order is usually the same; Pork fried rice, Pork chow mein, Fried Dumplings. 
It has hit the spot every time we've ordered.
The restaurant itself is charming and their servers are friendly. We usually order through Yelp Eat24 and haven't had a problem with our order once."}
{"text":"5 stars every time!  My husband and I go every other week with our 3 kids. The prices are amazingly reasonable and the food is out of this world. I always order the mongolian chicken (non spicy) and every time it is better than the last. The waiter knows us by now and always takes good care of our order and service is top notch. My family flew in from NJ/NY and we had to take them to this place...they loved it and want to come back during their next trip! Most people from the east coast know good Chinese food so this was a big deal to get their approval."}
{"text":"It's your typical American Chinese restaurant. Good fast Chinese food. The walnut shrimp in particular is especially good."}
{"text":"This place is gross! I just ordered delivery today cuz I didn't have the car and I got a coupon in the mail from them if I order so I decided to try it. Man was that the worst decision ever! First thing I notice is the chicken egg rolls they charged me for were spring rolls (no chicken) next thing I noticed since I was already looking at the bill to see if they maybe misunderstood me since they kept having me repeat stuff and spell words out (random, I know I articulate just fine).  But anyway on the bill it says DELIVERY FEE $3 but on the ADVERTISEMENT $2. At this point it's the integrity of the company I question and how honest are they.  So I try the food my free item from the coupon Ragoons are over cooked it's burnt on the edges. Fried rice is just rice tossed is a lot of oil and threw a few worm size egg strips as filler. THAT AINT FRIED RICE PEOPLE! Orange chicken they claim to be the best ain't the best pandas is better! All in all I was over charged and under PROMISED. Go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Overall I was pleased. I am still on the hunt for really amazing General's Chicken. In the meantime, the General's Tso's Chicken here was still very good and the portion was really large. This will be my safety school that scratches the itch until I find the one I am looking for. The quest for the best General's Chicken continues..."}
{"text":"Nothing thing beats consistency.  I sometimes feel like some establishments in the valley are flash in the pan, fly by night in quality.  Once the honeymoon's over, you're left with the 'meh' and not the ah.

Baidu is a place that doesn't leave you with buyers remorse.  I'll happily drop $50 and feed contently for days on leftovers.  

I can't remember his name, but his smile is unforgettable- he always accommodates whenever I ask for something off menu.  Salt and Pepper pork for instance.  He once joyfully demonstrated that he couldn't close the container because he made extra.  As expected, delish.

I highly recommend this place for pickup or carry out.  Dining in isn't bad either as the place is clean, but with home so close, I prefer take away."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 15 times and it's awesome. The customer service has also being very nice. This is my lunch time spot and on occasions the waiter will give a second serving of soup for free, which is nice at times. I've had about 5 different meals from the menu and each one was very good."}
{"text":"The family who owns/runs this establishment are wonderful, friendly, kind, and thoughtful. When I came here to order take-out to take-out and eat-out their son continually brought me what turned out to be very tasty fortune cookies.

I recommend them... the food, the fortune (cookies), the family, the fun. They take very good care of you as was reported by some other Yelpers on here.

The food itself was quite tasty, not too salty and didn't leave us feeling bloated, greasy, or ill.

I ordered a chicken with potato dish mainly for the novelty of the combination at an Asian restaurant and was very pleased with it. In fact of everything ordered this was totally finished, along with the won ton soup. This too had a nice depth of flavor that was not too salty and again did not leave you feeling as though you needed a wheelbarrow to move you from room to room.

I am really looking forward to sampling more of the menu as time goes on. It is great to find a good Asian Bistro near your home that has a wonderful family owning/running it and food that is delicious to boot.

Lasty- The prices are compelling and would give me pause to sample another Asian restaurant in the vicinity. 

Bravo"}
{"text":"This place is great. I have ordered here many times now. Our order is always correct, pipeing hot, delicious delivered quickly and generous portions."}
{"text":"The spot is clean. The service was friendly. The ingredients were fresh. It wasn't mind-blowing or for a die-hard Chinese foodie, as the offerings here are definitely the standard American fare a la Orange chicken. The scallion pancake hit the spot. My order was beyond simple: American broccoli in a spicy garlic sauce, and it was just what I expected. I also had a couple of bites of my husband's Orange chicken. The pieces were large and perfectly fried, and I thought the sauce was really good. It wasn't overly sweet or some insane shade of incomprehensible orange. It tasted as if someone had put some thought into its creation. On a previous occasion I had a couple of bites of mei fun, and that was also executed well. They offer brown rice, always a bonus in my book. If we are nearby and hungry, I would go back."}
{"text":"Upon entering my friend and I were afraid this place looks to trendy to have good authentic food. We were wrong! It was delicious with great portion size. I actually took part of mine home. My friend cleaned his plate LOL.
Don't let the trendy look fool you, there is a cook in the back that knows whats what. We both like spicy food and asked for hot sauce, we were not disappointed.
I would definitely go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Super friendly service. Not sure if this is family business but it feels like it. Very nice menu. I had the Wor Won Ton Soup. It was HOT fresh veggies and very low in oil. The chicken broth was lovely. Unfortunately it was just a bit lacking in flavor. Perhaps a bit of herb or onion. I felt the won tons were a bit underdone. I also wish they would use a nicer mushroom. Somehow those button mushrooms are just too bland. I would return and try another dish."}
{"text":"The food was very hot and fresh when it arrived - the fried rice, chicken wings and egg drop soup were awesome! Will definitely order from here again!"}
{"text":"We often have dinner here, sometimes a large party and they are always the best! Order is always perfect, food is fresh, service is excellent and they always appreciate your business. Eric is an awesome waiter and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Just like so many other smaller \"Mom & Pop\" places in town, I've noticed the quality slipping of food at Baidu with the hard times. It used to be so fresh and nonrant.-greasy, and now it is more bland and definitely tastes reheated and not fresh. I always order the same or similar dishes and could really tell the difference the last two times I ordered--I really do hope that Baidu goes back to its old freshness standard or else I will have to start looking for a different neighborhood, local Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"This is our preferred Chinese food place in the neighborhood. Their food is delicious and their deliveries are always prompt. Definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"My friends ordered food to go for the 3 of us. Certain things I wouldn't normally order/try they did and to my surprise it tasted great. We had the Chow mein, Beef & broccoli, Fried tofu and eggplant, & green beans. Decent price and decent food. Would like to try out some of their other dishes next time."}
{"text":"I really didn't like anything we got here. I usually try the General Tso's Chicken and Beef Pepper Steak every time I try a new Chinese spot. The beef was tender but the sauce they had it in was way too salty, tasted like they dumped beef bullion on it. The General Chicken was dry and the sauce had no heat  and we asked for medium heat thinking we're playing it safe in either direction. The steamed rice was fine. I also got some Tempura Shrimp, tasted a bit of old oil and the batter was way too thick. So much for trying a new place that looked like it has pretty good reviews."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's cute inside, friendly and fast service, and we got lunch specials with a bunch of goodies included for $7 each. 

Like!!!! 


*Update* I'm here again with my honey and yes I still love this place. It feels nice and romantic and DELICIOUS while still being $7 each. I'm eating the freshest most tastiest won ton soup right now."}
{"text":"What can I say but GOOD not great food.  We ordered honey walnut shrimp, Teri chicken and beef chow fun.  Portion size was good except for teri chicken, it was so all and not very meaty at all.  Order came with 2 sm containers of typical white rice and a few fortune cookies...all for $32 and change.  Was ok but nothing special and nothing authentic as the menu indicates -- this is the same caliber as china a go go or one of those fast food Chinese places."}
{"text":"They must of heard the complaints and changed things around. Tried them again recently and the food was back to being top notch. Way to go, keep it up."}
{"text":"I always order the same thing at Baidu, so take that into account with this review.

But my usual order is delicious, and just as importantly for a Chinese restaurant, consistent.

Their scallion pancake is a stellar appetizer, a Szechwan specialty that can be challenging to find in Vegas. Thin pastry layers have green onion flattened in between them. It's maybe more of a frybread texture than a flapjack. It's served with a soy ginger dipping sauce that's best used sparingly.

Pork fried rice is my favorite Chinese dish. I know that's not very adventurous, but I don't care. Good pork fried rice is one of life's simple pleasures. Baidu's is, for starters, served in portions that strain the sides and top of the to-go cartons. The pork is mostly lean and a rich red color from the BBQ treatment. The vegetables are cooked to tenderness, like in a pilaf. The rice is just the right mix of fried and moist, with enough seasoning that you don't need to add soy, I find it well complemented by the searing hot mustard available on request.

My new go-to for Chinese."}
{"text":"I find Chinese delivery food to be universally bad or mediocre at best no matter where I live.  However, I keep ordering it, mainly that I find it to be somewhat like comfort food.  Even when it's not that great it is still good at times.  Lately, since my food poisoning scare with my delivery food from Thai House Restaurant , I've practically stopped ordering Asian food all together.  

I recently, had that \"comfort food\" longing within me and decided to give this place a try after moving to this area last month, encouraged by the reviews that said the food was fresh.  I was delighted that for once the food was indeed fresh, with the vegetables in the Shrimp and Vegetable dish most notably cooked perfectly and not mushy or greasy.  They had brown rice options, and the fried rice was spectacular.  The orange chicken was the most memorable I have had out of the Chinese delivery restaurants I have ordered from.

So this has quickly become my favorite Chinese Delivery restaurant in Las Vegas, and probably the only place I will order from while I live in this area."}
{"text":"Better than average Americanized Chinese food. I was somewhat surprised that some of the dishes here were pretty good. I had the fried tofu appetizer and it was very well prepared. The salt n paper shrimp was also quite tasty.  

Of course they had the typical egg foo young and orange chicken.  They looked fine but they are not my cup of tea.  I would not order those dishes but those in my party that did seemed to enjoy them."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy their food. Clean flavor and good quality but last two times I just couldn't enjoy their food at all, so I took a little break from ordering food from Baidu. A couple days ago I decided try it again and it was a big mistake. I tossed the food away after I had a few bites. the Chow fun had burnt taste, Chicken chop suey had no flavor and Orange beef was covered with too much batter and flavor was very off, not like usual. I was very disappointed that their food didn't taste like used to be. The quality is not there anymore. No more ordering food from Baidu...."}
{"text":"When the good got to our house it was awful.  Hi ken was fried so much it wasn't even edible.  The noodles were good.  The fried rice had nothing else in it.  No veggies eggs nothin.   Won't order from here again"}
{"text":"ALWAYS GREAT ! We come once a week and love it every single time ! Great service & prices !"}
{"text":"So this guy John at our work recommended this place so I gave it a shot. 

After my meal I realized John was delusional  as everything was horrible. 

Soggy noodles, chicken was more like not chicken...and the even the rice which is hard mess up was heavy. 

Zero chance of returning."}
{"text":"I am so happy I ordered from here' I've tried several Chinese places in Vegas and I've got to say this is by far the best I've had! The food is so good! I was scared to try it at first because I've tried so many and they were fails to say the least and horrible! But I definitely recommend! Their rice was amazing. Everything we ordered was extremely good. I definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"The only place in Vegas that does not disappoint! Food is always awesome and the same every time! Great portion sizes and prices."}
{"text":"Nothing special here at all but for $7 you can't expect much. Was in the area and stopped in for a quick lunch. It was peak lunch hour and we were the only two people there the entire time, I think that says something. 

I ordered the chicken and broccoli lunch special which came with soup and an egg roll. The hot & sour was very thick with a weird gel texture that I didn't care for. The egg roll was fine but the fried rice was very oily. The chicken and broccoli was okay but nothing special. 

Im not in this area very often but would have no reason to return here if I was."}
{"text":"Consistently good food!! Great lunch & dinner combo specials!! Clean, neat restaurant w/ a nice, attentive staff. Nothing to complain about here! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that was ok. I would not say it was great but it was not bad either. It had mediocre standard Las Vegas style dishes, nothing stood out and yet nothing was awful either. I would not be likely to order from them again due to the fact that it was not only not great, but arrived cold which dampens the entire experience. My dumplings, after re-heating them, were the highlight of my experience with Baidu. The rest of the food left, well just left some empty feeling like you did not really eat."}
