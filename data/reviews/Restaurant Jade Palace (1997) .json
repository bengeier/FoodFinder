{"text":"This was my first and last time here. Although the service was really friendly, the food was really bad. The hot and sour soup was almost tasteless and the texture was gummy. There was a good variety of dishes but everything looked as if it had been sitting for a long time. Most of the sauces had a film floating on top. The sushi looked horrific. You're better off going to one  of the all you can eat sushi places that also have Chinese food."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Food were not fresh or hot. Quality were so bad that I could barely eat anything. The only edible food was the congee. 

Credit card machine system didn't work. 

Lady asked us if we leaved a tip at the table. Gratuity is option, not require."}
{"text":"Jade Palace is to start, as palacial as a 1985 Chevette. 
The decor is also from 1985. 
After having eaten here I think the food might also have been cooked back in 1985 and kept in a fridge since then.

That's how disgusting it all tasted. 

Chewy, tough, overly salty, gooey grossness.

If you are still driving towards this resto, before entering the resto, stop in their entrance and admire the attention to detail with ceiling tiles falling apart and boxes of crap lying around, then the wonderful front desk where you will have to pay after you've eaten their terrible food, inspect how old and cruddy everything seems like. 

The thin layer of plastic on the tables is definitely a quality touch, it screams EXCELLENCE!
The old cutlery is another great touch.

Does this place really exist or did I just have a nightmare?
This is beyond any Kitchen Nightmare I've seen.
 I would love to inspect their kitchen and see how they operate.

This is a dump.

Buy a snack at Pharmaprix next door and find somewhere else to go!

Worst buffet I have EVER been to!

Worst than FuLam!"}
{"text":"If you ever been to a Chinese buffet, you've already been at Jade Palace. This place is pretty much Fu Lam or Le Mandarin is but with better service.

You walk in, get assigned a seat and start to pig out with 50-60 different types of selection available to you. From soups to a variety of meats, to vegetables to salad ending up with a handful of desserts and ice cream.

Nothing available really stands out other than my personal favorite the short ribs in sweet sauce which I put on top of some fried rice. So good.

Service was quick and efficient. In fact, impressively so.

The price tag is excellent. With it being about 11$.

This is a solid place to eat once in awhile."}
{"text":"Good Chinese Place. In here pretty much every place looks a like and taste the same thing. The Whole point of Jade Palace is the «Chef» cooking your self-made plate AND drinking  your whole glass of water before the waiter/waitress comes back and fills it back. The Buffet is ok and the price is reasonable. Let's say a family of 4 taking a soft drink or a beer gets around for 80$ max! Here no big difference betwin other chinese restaurant with americanize food"}
