{"text":"First time visiting this place after a recommendation from a friend's friend. First thought is it is a small place but we went ahead and tried it. Service was friendly and welcoming. They took our orders quickly and helped picked out stuff. We settled on the 2 people dinner platter which came with 3 types of meat, 3 appetizers and soup and salad. Everything was exceptionally well done and tasty. We thought the price is fair for all the food we got 33$ for the dinner for two. The rest of the menu was between 10-20$ which isn't bad for a great tasting Persian restaurant. Ps. Don't forget the cash as they don't take debit or credit."}
{"text":"Excellent! Very Authentic! Small place but nice. And this restaurant had a lot of rewards you could see the stickers awardee from 2000 something up to now! I am gonna take a pic of that when I get back! They only accept CASH."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food and and this spot is authentic Persian food ! Their babagounosh wAs sooooooo good and the meats were amazingly
Cooked ! The waitress was super sweet too ! Love from NY"}
{"text":"If I wasn't familiar with Persian cuisine I would say this place was fine, however, since I've been to many good Persian restos, I know that you're not gonna have best quality authentic Persian dishes here. Also they only accept cash! I probably will go there again cuz there's not many Persian restos in mtl and it's not too far from my place."}
{"text":"I have a friend that come here all the time with her hubby and one day I happen to be with them and believe me I am glad I was. 
It is a little place but full of treasure. 

The service is great and so fast. I was skeptical to try the pita, onion piece and better that is served while you wait for your meal but once I did I was surprise how good it was.

Since then I have been there so many time and the food...especially the meat is unbelievably amazing and so addictive. 

So please don't let the outside decor fool you because if you don't go you will miss out on the best persian food I ever had but bring cash or a credit card because they don't take debit"}
{"text":"Truly not only is this place the most delicious in all of Montreal. I am from Beverly Hills and by far their soltani was mouth water fresh and very tasty. I ate the whole plate. The food is top notch amazing here!!!! I highly recommend. The staff is very warm and nice too. Thank you so much. I can't wait to return and bring back my family to try this hidden gem!!!  I can say that their food is one of the best i have had in the USA and Canada!!! Very very very yummy!!!"}
{"text":"About as good a $12 meal as you can have. Start off with delicious soup and then receive plate of FIVE chicken thighs with herbed rice and those little red Persian berries sprinkles in top plus the obligatory grilled tomato. Mmmm so good. Quiet family atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Most of the time the food is quite good, the server is nice and many Iranians find this establishment to be comparable to kebab in Iran. However the last two times my koobideh was undercooked, I don't particularly like raw pinkish koobideh so they should probably fire up that grill a bit higher."}
{"text":"To be honest, I was pretty disappointed. I got one of the beef dishes. The beef was good. Not spectacular, not terrible. It was just good. Great texture, average flavor. The rice was ok too, but the sheer volume of it was completely unnecessary. The main dishes all come with soup or salad, and deciding to go the light route, I took the green salad. It was just some iceberg lettuce, a tiny bit of purple cabbage, and this tangy dressing that I wasn't too fond of. And then I got this basket of crispy, half burnt pita. That was a bummer. 

I came here because I saw the good reviews, I live close by, and I just wasn't feeling like cooking dinner. But honestly, I left wishing I had saved my $15 and just made a PB&J or something. I guess if you really want persian food, it's there, it's not terrible, but I wouldn't make a point to go back. On the plus side, service is fairly fast (though, a little cold)."}
{"text":"Not the best Persian food you'll ever eat in your life (Montreal doesn't have any great Persian restaurants) but it's a great place for cheap takeout. The food is fresh, tasty, not greasy or fattening and the price is right. Take out is your best bet since it's not the most comfortable dining experience. I always get Gormeh Sabzi on Mondays and their rice is perfect. If you're nice, you might even get a piece of Tahdig."}
{"text":"Just prefect, love it, the host was very friendly and made sure I get what I wanted, 
A sample platter with everything I could have wished for.
I am only visiting Montreal but for sure we will be back. 

Highly recommend the Ashhh (soup)

Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"My my my, truly one of the best in Montreal for an amazing kebab.

The prices have gone up but the koobideh is always a bargain for $11.50 for 2 skewers.

Always order the Ash soup, you will not regret it ( although you only get half the quantity when it's 

Here's how I do it each and every time, grab some raw onions and parsley, wrap in in the buttered and toasted pita and open up the appetite.

They do pile on the rice but it is truly wonderful with the saffron and lindenberries and you can load it up with butter and sumac.
The broiled and charred tomato also oozes juices into the rice.

The meat selection is small but they do it so well. 

The appetizers are also great, eggplant and the yoghurt dip, at that point it's better to get the hunter's platter.

I do have to mention how cold it gets near the Windows in the winter so best to eat away. The place is also pretty small so they can't really handle large groups"}
{"text":"Excellent comfort food: tasty/good quality food with big portions at good prices with a nice homy staff.
I have been coming down there for many years and go at least once a month throughout the whole year. Never been disappointed and will keep eating their food :)
If you are hungry and love or want to discover Persian food. It is one of the best place to go in Montréal without breaking the bank.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Our Uber driver recommended this place because we were looking for a Persian restaurant. The food was fantastic and the people that work there very nice. Great for lunch."}
{"text":"Love it. Always fresh very tasty not expensive at all for the amount of food you get. Try the special for two it's about 33$ comes with 3 kinds of delicious meats and to start make sure you try the eggplant puree it's soo yummy with the garlic yogurt drizzled on top of it. Great friendly staff."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here upon recommendation from a friend, so I didn't bother checking Yelp reviews. I should have because this is a cash only place, which I was not expecting. Ok so before I write the rest of this I will say that the food is good if you enjoy Iranian food. Also the waitress was fairly nice. That's all the good points I have in this review.

The bathroom was pretty filthy and if you're of the female gender, all I can say is good luck. You might have to hold it till you get home (or back to the hotel in our case).

My big beef with this place is (no pun intended) that nowhere do they display a sign (believe me, I checked) or even mention to patrons that this is a cash only place. IMHO if you're going to operate a cash only restaurant then you MUST inform people. So we ordered, and ate and got the rest of our meal packed up.

Then when it came time to pay, I was told to pay up at the front so I made my way over. I asked if debit is okay and I find out they do not accept debit or credit and \"cash only\" is the norm. The total came to about $38 bucks.So I had $40 in my pocket which actually was Extremely lucky, with a capital E, as I am one of those people that never carries more than a few bucks cash around. I paid the manager and yes I felt bad about not leaving more than change as a tip, but honestly what am I gonna do.. Walk for God knows how long and find a bank so I can leave a tip? Some of you may argue with this but sorry I wasn't about to do that.

Then I get back to my table and sit down. I take a last sip of my drink and get up to put my jacket on. I turn around and the manager is a foot away from me telling me that the \"service charge\" aka tip, is not included in the price (well, no kidding!). She proceeds to tell me in her most snarky voice, that she pays tax on my meal (note: I witnessed her not ring anything in the register and she gave me a verbal total), and it's customary to leave something.

I was thinking \"seriously lady I can't believe you just said that\" but I said, in my nicest and calmest indoor voice \"Honestly I always leave a tip but I was intending to pay with my card and didn't know you only accept cash. Luckily I had $40 and I would've left more of a tip but that's all I had on me.\"

I then put on my jacket and left. One minute prior she would have got a raving review but that kind of rudeness is unacceptable. I would have come back to this place every time I came to Montreal but now I will not even recommend it as an option.Though the food is good, find another place that treats their customers with some respect."}
{"text":"When I travel, I feel compelled to eat at as many different restaurants as I can.  I figure if you're only going to be there temporarily you should try as many different things as you possibly can!  On my recent 3-week business trip to Montréal, there were only two restaurants that I visited more than once.  One of them was La Maison De Kebab.

Of course, as others have previously said in one way or another, the meat here is delicious.  Well seasoned and cooked beautifully, the large slab of fillet was plated alongside white and yellow rice and a side salad with a creamy, flavorful dressing.  A random grilled tomato comes along for the ride, although I don't care for tomatoes so that stayed put.  The meal was massive, but fantastic. Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-maison-de-kebab-montreal?select=XrjW5AYHYOMHJkywZcEizw#6H2k8BP3eImk5Dx9c9D5Nw

Now as much as I love that meal, I know that I've also experienced other excellent meals in the city.  So why was La Maison De Kebab worthy of that second visit?

Oddly enough, lentil soup.

Before the meal came out on my first visit, I was given a bowl of lentil soup.  I didn't know it was lentil soup at the time, even getting it was a surprise because it wasn't mentioned on the menu as a part of the meal.  There's something special about it though, warming with a great thickness and texture. This tasty soup was topped with a drizzle of yogurt, and in the middle was what seemed to be some sort of mixture of blackened mint and maybe olive oil.  I'm not sure, but it was fragrant and delicious, and it really elevated the soup to something spectacular.  Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-maison-de-kebab-montreal?select=XrjW5AYHYOMHJkywZcEizw#uc14oLnZD0l75_9HPClikA

I went back to the loft and didn't stop thinking about that soup for the rest of my visit.  I posted about it on Facebook, attempting to enlist the help of others in determining what type of soup it was so I could try to find it locally when I got home.  I HAD to go back for a second visit, if only to find out what that soup was!

Much to my dismay, it was \"just\" lentil soup -- there was no special name that I could refer to in a restaurant back home where they'd reply, \"Oh yes!  We have that exact soup that you are craving!\"  It's the best lentil soup I've ever had, but so much more than lentil soup, and in all likelihood I'll never see another like it until the next time I visit this beautiful city."}
{"text":"Miam miam !
Je dois dire que je n'ai pas été déçu et j'avais pas mal d'attente en plus sur ce restaurant.
J'aime beaucoup la cuisine orientale de part leurs assaisonnement à chaque fois très juste et goûteux.
Ici vous ne serez pas déçu de leur viande qui sont parfaitement cuites et assaisonné. Le reste de l'assiette est assez classique (salade ou riz) mais qu'est ce que la viande est bonne !
En entré vous avez une soupe (ou salade) qui est particulière au premier abord mais tellement bonne lorsque l'on mélange tout. Cette soupe est inclus dans les plats et vous remplira déjà le ventre ;)
A la fin du repas un thé est servis et inclus aussi dans la plat.
Le service est bien, pas beaucoup de place mais justement on s'y sent bien et cela fait penser à un tout petit restaurant familiale.
Je vous le conseille !"}
{"text":"The waitress was the rudest person I have ever encountered. She basically yelled at us. Horrible service but the kebabs were good..."}
{"text":"Got the Hunter's plate.  SO MUCH food, and very good quality for price.  Service was great as well. I believe the place is cash-only, as a heads up"}
{"text":"Tried this place with my dad a while back. The portions were generous but their chicken kababs aren't charbroiled entirely. It's more like semi cooked chicken finished off on charcoal, so that charcoal flavour doesn't penetrate in. Not impressed as there are much better options for chicken around town."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place since I moved into the neighbourhood but kept putting it off. Finally took the plunge and it was absolutely incredible. 

If you're a couple or on a date, get the Hunter's Platter and you won't regret it. Think of it as an intro to Iranian Food. 

The variety of dishes that are included are a true education in flavour. And best of all, this doesn't break the bank! Prices are reasonable, but do bring actual cash."}
{"text":"Last week I went three times to this place. It is excellent.

I always have their special with 3 different kinds of kebabs or the sultani that comes with two. I totally recommend the cucumber togurt"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is so good and satisying that it ventures into \"last meal\" territory.

The meat.  My god, the meat!  The folks here are doing things with Kebab meat that are so insanely addictive- it will make you lose your mind, leave your husband, divorce your kids and go on a cross country crime spree.

Later, when the judge lays the iron hand down on you - just tell him you had been eating at Maison De Kebab beforehand.  He'll understand and let you off.  And if he doesnt - hey, at least you know what to request for your last meal."}
{"text":"Some of the best value for your money I've found in Montreal at a sit-down restaurant, with great food and warm service. Persian restos in Montreal tend to come in two varieties: kebab houses like this place and fuller-service restaurants with a variety of stews in addition to kebabs (e.g. Quartier Perse). MK does a great job of the three kebab standards: koobideh (buttery, melt-in-your-mouth minced meat), joojeh (chicken) and barg (filet mignon). They have the usual range of appetizers, and all were great; we had mast-o-musir and mast-o-khiar (garlic and mint yogurt-based dips) as well as a particularly smoky, toothsome mirza ghassemi (eggplant and tomato dip). The Hunter's Platter for two gives you all three kebab varieties, three appetizers from their list, lots of pita bread, a plate of onion, radishes and parsley, a big dish of saffron-tinged rice with plentiful, tangy barberries on the side, AND a choice of soup (Persian-style noodle with beans) or salad, all for under $40. We left stuffed, satisfied and vowing to return more often. I've eaten here just three times in ten years (Atwater & Saint-Antoine is far from my Mile End comfort zone), but each meal has been consistently great. Cash only, which is par for the course for independent Montreal restos in this price range."}
{"text":"Perssian food it's the place to be you cant miss it the best place in persian food with a menu of day"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch when I still lived in the area. It's popular, and for a good reason.

The serving sizes are on the large size, and they're good value for money. I had the mixed plate, and the meat was cooked to perfection. I had plenty to take home for later.

Aparently they're open late too - it would be a great late night feed!"}
{"text":"First time here & wow we loved it! Small, simple place that doesn't look like much from the outside but all of food was both high quality and delicious.

Lots of Iranians were eating there on the night we went - that has to be a good sign!

The trio plate is enough for 2 hungry adults to share.

Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on our last night in Montreal, based on the previous reviews.  To be honest, it was a huge letdown.  The place is kind of a dive, but that doesn't always correlate with the food.  However, it never bodes well when a guy comes through the tiny, cramped restaurant with a bucket of dirty water and spills it all over the place.  The waitress got our order wrong the first time, and when we corrected her, she argued with us (just fix it, woman!).  When she got it totally wrong the second time (it's not that hard, they have a simple, limited menu), we just ate what they brought us because by then, we were starving.  The salads had bits of brown lettuce, and the pita bread was slightly burned.  The chicken was dry and the rice was tasteless.  We truly could not see what warranted such rave reviews from previous diners.  Maybe they had an \"off night\", but with EVERYTHING that went wrong, we doubt it.  To sum it up, don't go out of your way for this place -- you'll probably be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ayant des origines perses, ce restaurant est un excellent restaurant iranien de kebab.
Ce restaurant ne sert que des kebab.

C'est aussi le meilleur et pourquoi ?!

Excellent rapport qualité prix (environs 10-15$ / personne)  avec possibilité de commander à emporter.

Le restaurant est de petite taille donc en cas d'affluence, mieux vaut réserver.

Je recommande le plat kebab koubideh (9,75$) comprend le pain pita toaste, assortiments de crudité, salade ou soupe (je recommande la soupe), le plat principal (2 brochettes de buf hachées, salade et riz ou juste riz comme moi ^^) (le plat très très consistent), et pour finir le thé.

Les prix semble être taxe inclus donc n'hésitez pas à donner un gros tips car le plat peux faire deux repas (je donne environ 3-5$).


Très bon restaurant pour découvrir la cuisine iranienne / perse."}
{"text":"If you are looking for cheap good Iranian food, this place is pretty amazing for that. The service is great. We order the plate for two, it came with lentil soup. It was more than enough for two people, I can totally see three people share it"}
{"text":"Short review , in a city like MTL where there is so little Persian population of course they are going to sell  you guys a shit quality food, because people don't know the difference just look at the names of the people  who wrote the reviews   r u going to see  any Persian name nooooo because they don't  eat at this stupid place .BTW in montreal no such a thing as good Persian restaurant, out of Iran you'll only find excellent Persian food in LOS ANGELES .why ? Because in Los Angeles Persian population is almost 500000 that's why so restaurants are in a great competition they cant afford to serve shit quality food ,  not like here .
VERY VERY VERY BAD FOOD"}
{"text":"Make sure you do not say \"I'm craving meat\" out loud in the presence of unknown men. Be specific and say \"I am craving Maison de Kebab\" because this is hands down, the best, THE BEST, kebab joint in Montreal!

Don't be fooled by the humble exterior of this little Persian resto that could. With it's 8 or 9 tables, usually filled with Iranian patrons, and Iranian satellite TV on,  plain tables and chairs, Spartan surroundings, these people make meat addictive!

First off, the one dish you absolutely have to start with is the Mirza Ghasemi, a puréed eggplant dish that must have crack cocaine in it, you cannot stop eating it, it's *that* good. In fact when you've scooped up the last shred of it, you'll start to wonder if you should order another helping. By all means do.

Then there is the rice, a long, delicate, fragrant variety reminiscent of Indian basmati , but it isn't basmati rice, infused with saffron, a clodd of rice with melted butter and topped with a generous helping of dried, tart red barberries ( Zereshk Berries), giving each mouthful a jolt of sweet, tart yumminess. For a $4 charge, you can ask for extra berries and they will give it to you.

Then there is the meat.

Dear Reader, you have truly not lived until you have the grilled meat done like the way they do it here. Moist, savoury and done just right, you will develop an addiction. You will crave it  like no other. The days where you suddenly develop a craving, you will wonder if you can jam in a quick visit to La Maison de Kebab. 

This is one of the things I love about Montreal, that small, hidden, dives, with no fanfare, no marketing, no following, still serves better food than some of these more pricier, popular joints where you are paying more for the attitude than the food itself. Who needs that? Go to La Maison de Kebab instead."}
{"text":"Simply perfect. 
Small authentic place with warm service. 
The food is amazing!!!!!!!!
Cannot wait to go back and try all everything."}
