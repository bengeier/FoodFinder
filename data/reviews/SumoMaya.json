{"text":"Best sushi mexican combo in town. If you like a good stmosphere and great food check Sumo Maya out."}
{"text":"The hamachi roll was good but the tacos were small for $7. They should have been a tiny appetizer. Wait staff were ok but they were busy and said there was an hour to two hour wait. We waited 45 min. Would have had a seat at the bar because this nice guy moved over for us but then post menopause lady and her eager friend took our spots. All of paradise valley was here though so if you wanna be out, good place with a good vibe."}
{"text":"Another typical, overpriced and overrated upscale Scottsdale restaurant. One of their unmemorable soups was extremely salty. I asked the waiter if he's tried it and he said 'No.' I think the chef spilled the salt shaker in the process of concocting a nonedible dish. The waiter just said \"Well, would you like to counter the taste with some sweet dessert?\" Are you f***ing kidding me? Not worth the time or money. Do yourself a favor and eat at Chipotle and Panda Expess for a fusion experience."}
{"text":"The Suzuki and Shishito rolls are amazing! The pomegranate guac is incredible! And the drink selections, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, are inventive and delicious. But what's best of all is the over-the-top, personalized, enthusiastic, informative and engaging service by server-extraordinaire Chris. He absolutely made our night!"}
{"text":"Very fun evening spot. Brunch is also great. Short rib Benedict was delicious. Unlimited mimosas. Be sure to take UBER"}
{"text":"It doesn't matter how tasty the food might be! This is the loudest most unpleasant restaurant I have ever visited. The wait staff couldn't even hear well enough to take an order. Skip this dreadful place!!"}
{"text":"The dishes are very flavorful, although I am not a fan of the tapas 'small plates'. Our favorite thing on the menu is their green magic mojito... deeelish. One complaint is that although we had reservations for a group of 10 for a birthday, we waited almost 1.5 hrs for our table and the hostess was pretty rude when we inquired about it. We finally asked another server and were seated."}
{"text":"Impressed with the quality of sushi, enjoyed the cocktails and service was attentive and friendly. The menu was a little overwhelming for a first time guest, but there were definitely not a shortage of menu choices.  I want to go back soon and try more  dishes. Overall great first visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a great experience here. This is a big, open, loud place with a feeling of a lot of activity. There is a large bar in the center with projector televisions, and even the inside area has an outdoors feel. Not the place to go for a quiet, intimate dinner. The waitress told us there were four kitchens, so everything you order comes out at different times. We had a great server who seemed to have absolute perfect timing - was always there when we wanted something without being overbearing. The food is served tapas style, but the portions of most of what we ordered were actually pretty large and we ended up ordering more food than we needed. We got the edamame, the pomegranite guac, pork pad thai, and korean beef tacos. Everything was amazing. The drinks were also fantastic. I expected to like the place based on what I had heard, but it exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food. Good flavor and although they say tapas, the portions were big enough to share.Took forever to get a second drink and we finally canceled it although the server kept checking back. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Happy hour is awesome price wise and really yummy!!  We came on Sunday and had those delicious mushrooms tacos. They made the best ahi tuna hand roll. So tasty:)  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, Pad Thai, fried rice & Pomegranate Guacamole!  Yes if you like variety and enjoy sharing, this is a great place to enjoy some delicious Asian/Mexican entr√©es with a spicy twist!"}
{"text":"This place is weird, not in a cool way. Although I liked the decor I just don't understand why there are so many people in here.    I wasn't a fan of the food, the ramen tasted like an instant ramen packet, then everything else we had was sickly sweet. The sweet and savory thing is nice here and there but not every plate. True asian cuisine is immensely savory, the food here was all covered in either hoisin or brown sugar from the taste of it.    My server was nice but I won't be coming back, didn't enjoy it."}
{"text":"Please close down.  Reservation at 7:30 on the patio.  Got there on time.  Finally seated at 8:00 inside.  Way too noisy for a restaurant.  Actually this is a bar trying to be a restaurant.  Manager offered complementary guacamole, which was actually added to the bill.    We moved from inside to the patio at 8:30 and then finally served at 9:00.  2 of the 4 meals came out at the same time, then another 10 minutes later, then another 10 minutes after that.  Waitress tells the table that food comes out when the chef finishes making it.  Not necessarily at the same time.  Got out of there at 10:00.  What a disaster.  Food as okay but not great.  Kind of a gitchy idea of combining Asian and Mexican but only okay.  Service was lousy.  Really really really lousy.  No idea of how to take care of customers.    If you like a bar setting with really huge tv's then this may be your place.  As for the food, 2 of the 4 people thought it was good. 1 was way too bland.  The dish was some sushi thing with raspberry sauce.  Nearly puked it was so bad.  The other not so good dish would have been okay had it not taken nearly 45 minutes to arrive.  The inside is nicely decorated.  But more like a pick up bar than a restaurant.  Too many plastic faces standing around waiting to be recognized.  More like L.A. than Scottsdale.    Wait staff need to be trained.  Don't have a clue about how to treat customers.    To top it off, woke up with a huge migraine which I never get.  I can only think they use some crap in their food like MSG or something.    Prices too high for what it is.  So many other good places worth the money, not this place.  Please stop embarrassing Scottsdale with this attempt at fusion of Asian and Mexican."}
{"text":"Love this place, the food as well as the ambiance is excellent.  My favorite thing on the menu is the Korean beef tacos. Staff is super friendly and the music is great."}
{"text":"So, Mexican Asian fusion sounds like a stretch, but it's actually really good. I was in here for lunch service and was delighted by the food and service that we received. The server was knowledgeable and served us our food in a timely manner to where it was not overwhelming. His suggestions were thoughtful and he communicated well.   So the food... Was great, the plates are beautiful and balanced. I started with the hamachi ceviche and the truffle oil shined through without ruining the taste of the fish. The sushi rolls were also great and all of it was just great.   The dessert and coffee were amazing! We had the tres leches cake and I had a cup of coffee to go with it. The coffee was light and had a mild sweetness to it. The server told us that it was a coffee place based out of Tempe... Blah blah blah this place deserved the 5 stars that I gave it."}
{"text":"Slooooooow service and the place was half empty.  Took an hour to get our rolls, and no apologies. Sushi was okay, nothing special.  Won't go back."}
{"text":"Server forgot to put in our other entree. Had us waiting for 20 minutes with the check at the sushi bar. Had to get the chefs attention to put our order in. They delivered our order in a TOGO box. We did not want it to go. We were so frustrated we just left. Horrible experience won't be going back"}
{"text":"Nice Gimmick, but really over complicating food, mixing too many different styles....small servings, more like tapas style.  You are better off going to the best Mexican restaurant in town or the best sushi bar in town and forget trying to combine and blend the two!  Trendy, maybe too trendy for this area....  I wonder if this place will be open in a year or two?"}
{"text":"This place not only had the BEST dinner and dessert, but their kitchen staff (we sat at a table overlooking the kitchen) were phenomenal and made this a really cool experience. I would recommend this place to anyone. This place is a home run!"}
{"text":"Chef Herb is the hardest working man in PV!  Thanks for a great experience and a spectacular meal!  - your new regulars"}
{"text":"Just had the Apple-Salmon roll. Oh. My. Gosh! That may have been the best roll I've ever had! Delicious!!"}
{"text":"I had 2 pieces of wagyu sushi. I thogut it was $6, when our bill came, they charged us $45!!!!!!!! It was apparently 'market price', but our server didn't warn us. Dissapointed."}
{"text":"Sumomaya has a great atmosphere and has delicious food. Very friendly staff and great service. Did I mention the great food!?? My family went there for the first time and absolutely loved it. The soup was delicious and big enough to share with another person. All around a great experience"}
{"text":"Great food. Very good service. A little slow on the refills but overall a great dining experience. I'll return."}
{"text":"Love all the food I have tried. The service is outstanding. We asked for the quietest table so we could talk. Still literally had to shout to each other and to the server to be heard. Don't know what occasion it would be good for... I guess if you are with someone you don't want to talk to. The music was amped up another notch or two about 8:30pm when we left."}
{"text":"i don't normally like sushi but this place was delicious! we also tried the chicken tacos which were to die for. so so good. definitely have to go back! we liked our server. it was loud. trendy."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot for good tacos and sushi! First, we ordered the tacos for happy hour (4 for$7). Those were delicious! Then we ordered Salmon Avocado Roll that was very good! The Pork \"Al Pastor,\" were my favorite. I suggest you try them. The service and time for everything was good and perfect! Then for dessert was the salted  caramel ice cream and a chocolate cake! Best Place in Scottsdale! I rate 5/5."}
{"text":"Big Daddy and I came back for Happy Hour. Awesome as the first time.  Sat at the bar with Jeremy, who was slinging drinks, recommending food and chatting up customers better than Tom Cruise in Cocktail ( he is not old enough to know that movie.:). We had Chicharron de pollo with Miso Mustard.  The miso mustard balanced the crispy chicken.  Next was Rock Shrimp Tempura with a truffle aioli that we loved.  The secret sauce, In house made Mango Habanero sauce that Jeremy shared kicked it up a notch.  Finally we ended with the Chinese Style Crab Garlic Noodles.  Foodie food for sure.  Delicately composed, with a nice depth in flavor.  The garlic was surprisingly subtle, but there.  The spice was just right.  A dish we will order again! We will be back!  Atmosphere is crowded but bearable. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Visit this excellent culinary delight! First, make a reservation so you actually get a table. Bring a few bucks cash for the required valet. Okay, the food: loved everything!! We ordered crispy pork belly sushi roll, Suzuki roll, the Korean beef tacos, and lastly the pad thai. Everything was perfection--seriously! Our very favorite that we want to duplicate at home is hands down the Korean beef tacos-incredible! Everything was wonderful and very high quality, not just hype here, so you really can't go wrong. Service was fantastic, wine & beer great, ambiance sublime. Hubs & I got out for $100 with tip and that included drinks, apps, & entree that we shared. We were stuffed. Dress up if you're going on the weekend."}
{"text":"Cute, trendy atmosphere and I love the overall fusion of Asian and Mexican. We went for brunch but they were kind enough to make something for me off the dinner menu that I'd been wanting to try. Kimchee fried rice is so good! Everyone in my party enjoyed their brunch items (short rib beni, chilaquiles, steak sandwich etc) BUT they don't have a kids menu. We had to order short stacks which was still a lot of food and pricier than normal kids food. You can't go wrong with bottomless mimosas and their juice mixer options too!"}
{"text":"So I was raving about this place until I went for happy hour on a Friday afternoon. It was 4:50 when we asked to be seated in the main dining area because they opened the door/window panels in the middle of AZ summer. 5pm came and I had to argue with the brunette, frumpy, lumpy and ill-mannered head hostess to seat us inside because we were sweating like hookers in church (by then). She had the audacity to ask us to make reservations next time. The dining room was 95% empty. The food...I went during the week and it was phenomenal. I ordered the guacamole crab app again but this time they topped with a tea spoon of crab versus the plentiful amount of yesteryear. Bottom line: don't go to this restaurant on a Friday or Saturday night because you'll get bad service from staff and inconsistent food quality from the middle chef."}
{"text":"Table of ten with a mix of adventerous and not. Drinks were excellent. Service was quite good. Had the shishito ramen and have to say the noodle choice was not my favorite and the amount of noodles was lower than expected. Vietnamese shake beef was good and the table really enjoyed the mushrooms and the corn side. Korean beef tacos were laughable as others have commented."}
{"text":"Just sat down at the bar and was told that they can't serve food until 4:30 because they were busier than expected at lunch. Huh? What restaurant does that?!?! Do I need to call before I show up to ask if I can eat??? Wow."}
{"text":"Jordan was the best bartender ever!! Very attentive and definitely made me and my friend feel welcome!"}
{"text":"The food tasted good - but the dining experience and service left a lot to be desired.  I went to Sumo Maya last night for the first time. I was invited out to meet a fiend for her B-day. When we got there at about 8:15pm the place was packed and thumpin' like a night club. Wall to wall people and barely an inch to squeeze by.   We found our group seated at a large table, they had already been there since 6:00pm and had been eating and drinking all night, so I had some catching up to do. Couldn't find the waitress or waiter - whoever was looking after our table for 20 minutes, so I fought my way upstream to the bar where I squeezed in and out of people at my attempt to get a drink. As expected the bar was slammed and everyone working there was super busy and it was next to impossible to get a drink order in. Finally got the attention of a bartender and I got my drinks rater quickly after I was able to place the order.   Went back to my table of friends and joined in the fun. I was starving and wanted to order some food. About 40 minutes in a waitress finally showed herself only because two friends at my table grabbed her because they needed to tab out and leave early. I asked if I could order and she came over once she was available. My fianc√© ordered the Pad Thai Pastor and I ordered the Braised Pork Belly. This is where it got awkward....  I understand busy and when restaurants are busy all you can do is wait, I am fine with that, more drinks for me! - If you could get an order in. I was excited to see that Sumo Maya is so popular, which could only mean one thing...Sumo Maya was doing something right and must be worth the wait. So wait I did.  About 30 minutes later my fianc√©s Pad Thai came, a server - not our waitress delivered it and placed it at our table, so naturally he waited for my order to come. When it was clear that my order was nowhere and most certainly not on its way - I asked him to start eating so that his didn't go cold. I waited, I waited, and I waited....He finished his meal and I finally found our waitress and asked where my order was and she informed me that the food comes out as it is completed in the \"free-flowing kitchen\". This meant nothing to me except that it lends itself to an awkward dating experience when one person has their food and the other does not. I understand appetizers coming at random times to a table, but not so much something that was ordered as a entree.  The menu did state \"Our unique free-form dining style is designed to heighten and arouse your senses.\" and not having dined at Sumo Maya before and the waitress didn't ask if we were familiar with the way in which their \"free-flowing kitchen\" works, I did not understand what Sumo Maya's \"unique dining style\" was. I thought that this disclaimer on the menu was just a fancy way of saying that everything is a-la-carte and tastes good. Not, you get it when you get it and waiting while your date finishes their entire meal and you just watch them eat is part of the heightened senses experience.  The music was so loud inside that it was next to impossible to have any conversations with anyone from our group. So while I awkwardly sat and waited for my meal all I could do was sit there and smile and watch my fiance eat his dinner. It was so darn awkward....no food, no conversation and no drinks.  A little insight from the staff when ordering would have been wonderful and probably would have prevented an awkward situation. If you go there on a date, don't expect to be fed at the same time. The portions are very small but tasty. We were both still hungry after we finished the small portion controlled meals and there was no way we were going to make a second attempt at ordering more food...so we left hungry and went on to have a real dinner somewhere else.   This place is fun and cute but probably more of a pick-up joint and drinking place than a serious restaurant. Only good for apps and drinks, if you can get them! Also...bring earplugs cause it is louder than being front row at a concert. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"A solid four stars, Sumomaya is a lively, hip gastro bar with an unexpected twist: Asian/Mexican fusion. Whaaat?! It works.   Topping our list tonight: The sea bass. Seared perfectly, deliciously salty/sweet, delicate yet portioned generously enough for hearty appetites.   Next, the king crab guacamole is amazing. An absolutely delicious appetizer served with fresh-made corn tostada shells, and large enough for our party of four to really enjoy. The tempura popcorn shrimp with pickled red and green jalepeno was outstanding as well.  The only reason I hold back on five stars was due to the beef dish and the panko lobster dish. The beef bites were chewy, not tender, served on a bed of water cress and onions, onions, onions. Red onion, and stalks of green onion. The onions were far too many, and undercooked, almost raw. Way too potent for intimate conversation. The stuffed panko lobster... Anyone can chop up lobster meat and mix it with sriracha sauce. 'nuff said.  Speaking of intimate conversation. You definitely will get close to your date at Sumomaya; it's the only way you'll hear each other. And this was a Sunday night, their quietest night. Still, it's a great place for a date, just maybe not a first date, and make sure she's a little adventurous! Sumomaya is culinary experience."}
{"text":"I ate here last night for the first time, and absolutely loved it. I didn't know what to order or even what the concept of the restaurant was really about, but my server Kayla Ortiz was extremely helpful. She answered my many questions and I ended up letting her pick out everything I ate and drank, and loved everything she chose."}
{"text":"Loveeee this place! I've had almost everything on their menu and it is all WONDERFUL! You definitely have to try the bacon wrapped dates, rollo chingon, pomegranate guacamole and mushroom tacos.  Love the ambiance! Servers are great and know their stuff. Drinks are really good too.   Best Mexican Asian fusion I've ever had! Great place for HH."}
{"text":"Good vibe and atmosphere, but thought food was overpriced for the quality.  The tuna tacos were too hard to eat and the Chinese Style Chili Crab Noodles was missing something in the chili sauce. Great place to grab a drink though."}
{"text":"Went here because of the reviews. It was restaurant week and thought we would give it a try.    We were very disappointed.  The food was okay but not over the top.  we ordered the hamachi teradito.  The tuna was mushy and it lacked flavor. We also ordered the pad thai which was okay.  My daughter and her friend ordered the the chili crab garlic noodles.  Both of them remarked it lacked a distinct flavor.  We had the tres leches desert but found the marshmellow topping to be too much.  It took us over two hours to be served.  Our dishes arrived randomly. First came the guacamole which my daughter order and then 15 minutes later our first course arrived.  Shortly after that my daughter's second course arrived.  Ours did not show up for another 20 minutes.  There was another lull of 15 minutes and my dates arrived.  Our main course did arrive at the same time as did the desert.    We sat next to a table that the occupants were getting rather drunk  They were practicing yoga poses on the floor and falling.  Overall impression this restaurant is not for us.  Not our style.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"We came here based on quite a few great recommendations for our friends bachelorette party. We made a reservation ahead of time for 8:30. Immediately when we got there they told us the kitchen closed in 30 minutes and we had to order right then. The waitress didn't come to take our order for 15 minutes. We tried to address our concerns with the manager and received some sake which helped but then they tried to charge us for it. Overall would not return here."}
{"text":"We just had the best meal of our vacation.  Mike was very attentive and helpful.   The restaurant fun, colorful, and well done.   We will be back many times."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere.. especially if you are looking for the Scottsdale vibe.  The bartender Aaron is so great that I am now a faithful regular.  Really, the entire staff is awesome."}
{"text":"Another great night at Sumomaya! Previously we had only come for drinks. We decided to do a full meal this time and were not disappointed. The menu is overwhelming in the best way. So many items sound fantastic, thank god plates are small so you can try a lot. Our waitress Danielle was a gem! We asked her for suggestions and rather than rambling on about expensive or \"her\" favorites, she took the time to ask us a few preference questions to get a vibe for what we like to eat, and tailored her suggestions around our responses. She made so many great suggestions right off the bat, towards the end of the meal we let the waitress take the wheel and bring out whatever she thought we would like. The only thing that put a damper on our experience was the table next to us. They were exceptionally rude to our shared waitress, but she remained courteous and professional with them. Tables on the back patio are quite close together, but I guess they have to be because this place is always packed!"}
{"text":"The first time we went there the server enthusiastically reviewed the menu with us and explained the principles behind each dish. It was great to hear his enthusiasm. He guided us through the ordering and didn't let us over-order. Plus he warmly helped my 13 year old pick the right food. So I can honestly say the service is 5 star. On in top of that, the food was unbelievable. The popcorn shrimp, the shaking beef, the sea bass ... Just amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food and we had the best service. We will definitely be going back for any occasion to celebrate!"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai taste very authentic and with the el pastor pork takes it to the next level! Delish!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. This was one of the first restaurants I came to when I first moved to Arizona and it is still by far my favorite place. When ever I have visitors come to town, this is always the first place I take them too.  I love that you get to order a bunch of small dishes and try so many different things.  The miso eggplant is amazing.  I'm so glad my server recommended it because I never would have thought to order it, and now it is always one of the first things I make sure to order.  Their drinks are also really good, I love the green magic mojito and their seasonal margarita is always amazing.  I highly recommend this place (but not if you're looking for somewhere quiet)."}
{"text":"I was so excited about the concept of this restaurant. I have yet to be excited about anything I've ever had here. I think this was a failed attempt at a great idea. I do it better every night in my own kitchen. Super cute decor though and the staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"I am always skeptical of fusion places because I feel instead of being really good at one thing, you can end up messing up on two. There are very few places that can strike the balance. Sumo maya, fortunately got it right, atleast on my first visit here. I had the passion fruit sangria, bacon wrapped dates, fish taco and spicy corn. I liked the food and the drink was refreshing. I am a little confused on the use of the word fusion though, because to me the menu looked like there were mexican and asian dishes listed separately, not like I feared - i.e ceviche dumplings!   This place is really busy but the service is attentive and friendly. There is a giant tree in the middle of the room which gives it an outdoorsy feel. Great location. Parking is a little hard .   I did not get to try lots of things on the menu since I came with people who didn't eat as they had dinner plans later. So I will certainly be back with foodies to give this tapas place the attention it deserves."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful late  night meal on the patio at Sumo Maya.  We weren't sure what to expect, but every thing we tasted was fantastic!  We had the Sunomono, Maguro, Rock Shrimp Roll, Sea Bass and Grilled Asparagus.  Our favorite was the Sea Bass, but the Sunomono was the best I have ever had!  The service was great, the portions were on the small side, and it looks like it could be rather noisy when the place is busy so be warned.  We're definitely going back to try other things on the menu. They're doing a great job!"}
{"text":"It all depends what is a purpose of you going to this place. It is incredibly loud and  noisy place and you will have to yell in order to people across the table can hear you. Weird mix of club and restaurant. Food is good. Interesting spicy cocktails. Overall experience - average. Good for drinks and clubbing, but not suitable for dining."}
{"text":"Drove past this place a few times and finally decided to check it out.   Great outdoor patio that is enclosed during the day and misters kept it cool. Then they opened them at sunset which was cool.   Started with the guacamole plus pomegranate which was recommended by our waitress Jennifer.  We actually went with her other suggestions as well on the menu.  The Korean beef tacos were yummy.  The aroz con pato was muy excelente!  The extra special for me was an awesome grapefruit beer.   Yep,  read that again.  Grapefruit.   Very very good brew.  This would be a good date place and if I was single I have a feeling this would be a good happy hour spot as well."}
{"text":"SumoMaya is a great place to go for a night out on the town.  The decor is fantastic!  My favorite touch was the huge fake tree in the middle of the seating area, how neat is that?  The big TV's above the bar were blasting fun 80's and 90's music videos and kept our table dancing and singing in our chairs.  From the outset the concept of fusion Mexican and Japanese food intrigued me.  Would there be enchiladas with a sushi twist or fajitas spiced with wasabi?  The food wasn't quite along those lines but pretty inventive nonetheless.  The taste was pretty similar to the South American Asian fusion cooking I've had a lot here in DC.  Out of everything I loved the miso eggplant (the sauce was amazing) and the kimchee fried rice (very big portion size).  I also tried the sumo green roll, but it didn't blow me away (I didn't like the hard plantain chips with the soft rice).  The pour size for the wine was big and our waiter was super nice. He didn't hesitate to take the uneaten edamame off the bill, since the charred flavor didn't win anyone over.  The Phoenician I was with said it was her new favorite restaurant as we lumbered our way to the car with our full bellies."}
{"text":"Wow, tremendous flavor and everything was robustly seasoned. I ordered the Pescado Dorado taco, tuna tacos and grilled broccolini - I know, broccolini, just get it, awesome. Great patio, good crowd. $30 for the above with tax, good value."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd time here and had a great experience each time! Would like to see a better wine by the glass selection...."}
{"text":"Food is great but my rating is based on the waitress service, toooooo long to bring drinks and refills and just overall check up on the table, it was only a party of 4... We will be back because of how good the food is but hopefully the service will be better next time around"}
{"text":"Came in for my first time Saturday night and had a great meal. Out of the three signature sumo rolls I shared with my dad, I have to say the Red Dragon roll was the best. Apparently its a secret menu item and the sushi chefs don't like making it so hopefully I don't get in trouble for talking about it but it's exceptional. Definitely worth trying if you're looking for good food and a cool atmosphere. Pretty nice bar as well."}
{"text":"Words fail me when I try to think of a way to describe my experience here. From the moment you walk in, the ambiance is energetic. The staff are extremely courteous and friendly. They will explain what the menu is, what their favorites are, and explain how the flavors fuse together.  The service was stellar, the food was out of this world. We had the ahi tuna tostada, pork belly ramen and steak pepito. Every bite was a culinary explosion. The flavors melted in your mouth. This is an amazing place, and I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! I've only been here 2 times but both time it was outstanding. Every part of their menu is so amazing. I honestly can't say anything bad about this place!"}
{"text":"Not quite sure about the menu.  The pork belly noodles were so bland.  But the spicy tuna tacos were very good.  Other items were equally hit and miss.  Skip the desserts.  The decor was eclectic and fun.  Early on the vibe was great for families and couples alike.  We were 2 couples and liked the date nite appeal."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure how anyone could give this place more than 3 stars. I was shocked to find out that  sumomaya was not a fox concept, based on its extreme average-ness. I will say that it is a very nice space, and the service, while not notable at all, was fine. The food is about as unremarkable as you can get. A couple decent items and a whole lot of, well, \"2 star\" material. The kimchi fried rice was about the only dish that really left me feeling good about it.  Drinks were really not great either - not horrible, but again unremarkable.   Food: Meh Drinks: Meh Service: decent Ambiance: cool space, tree inside is a great look. Crowd is a bit poser-ish  The best way I can describe sumomaya is as a concept that is trying too hard, with a crowd that is trying to hard, and an execution level that isn't trying hard enough. If that makes sense lol. Super basic may be a more direct way to sum it up. Im so confused by the 4 and 5 star reviews, but hey, different strokes for different folks. I guess barely average at a higher than a average price appeals to some people. Skip this joint if you're in the area and go 30 seconds north to Roka... Or Shinbay if you're looking for something a little quieter with a set menu. Food and cocktails at Roka Akor are on a different stratosphere (in a very very good way) , the bar is GREAT,  ambiance is very sexy, and service is generally spot on."}
{"text":"Great ambiance ... Great food.. Great staff.... The cocktails are one of the best I've had.  Sushi rolls are DELICIOUS! I also had the guacamole and the touch of the apricot and pomegranate (surprisingly) made me want to only have guacamole prepared that way from now on! Def coming back!"}
{"text":"We tried everything. Lol. It was so good. Interesting  combination of flavors. Trendy and hip. Definitely would go back!!"}
{"text":"GREAT pick for couples or groups . If you are looking for a high end casual pick for a business meeting, this is the place to go. There is something here for everyone. Everything is plated absolutely beautifully as well and the drink menu is extensive . The only reason I did not give this five stars , was the dessert and coffee. It's clear their main focus is on the delicious starters and shareables . Eat more of that and skip dessert."}
{"text":"Disgusting sushi  Staff looked like they were scrambling - poor management  Overall food awful - typical restaurant tries to make loud music and big t.v's drown out the fact the food is bad."}
{"text":"We went to have dinner for my birthday and had made reservations the same day. It was pretty busy, but it had a very nice atmosphere. It was very upbeat and not stuffy at all. The food we had was delicious. We had the Suzuki roll, Mexican corn, kim chi fried rice, green tea soba noodles, and the best part was the Oaxaca guacamole. So yummy. The server we had, her name was Laina, she was SO attentive, always came by my table to check on us to see if we were ok. sumomaya exceeded my expectations. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere with a professional kitchen. Unique Mexican-Japanese fusion. Make sure to try the Korean Beef Tacos and don't miss brunch on the weekends!"}
{"text":"Food and drink was absolutely fantastic! The Mex-Asian fusion is done perfectly!  The Sumo Maya mojito is amazing. We tried about 6 things on the menu and all voted that the Sea Bass was unanimously the best Sea Bass we have ever had! I give it a 4 star because I wasn't  impressed with our service providers.  They were not friendly, and acted very stuck-up.  Just didn't seem like they enjoyed nor had any fun at their job!"}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews, but stopped in here for lunch today with my boyfriend and had to share our great experience.  The place has an awesome, hip vibe including a blast of air conditioning which is a necessity in this heat.  The waitress let us know that the dishes are served tapas style so we ordered the Shishito Roll, Chicken Tacos, Korean Beef Tacos, and the Kimchi Rice.  Everything was prepared to perfection.  We especially enjoyed the quality of the meats and fish served as well as the orange Citrus Habanero Sauce on the table (we mixed it with our soy sauce for our sushi roll and used it to top off our tacos!)    We can't wait to be back to check out the happy hour and dinner scene, and to add a couple of cocktails to the order.  One of my new favorite spots for sure!"}
{"text":"After having 2 stellar meals on previous visits, we decided to head to Sumomaya at the last minute to ring in the New Year with one of their famous concoctions from the bar. After settling into our seats at the bar, my daughter was carded and, despite the fact that she is 22, they refused to serve her a drink because of her ID being \"vertical\". She was humiliated and embarrassed. I understand the need for laws, especially when preventing under age drinking, but she is of legal drinking age..... And she was with her mother, for heaven's sake! It ruined what had been a wonderful evening, celebrating the New Year. The General Manager was completely inflexible, citing that the law was new ( he said it was instituted in Nov, when it was July) when we told him she had been served on our two previous visits.   We won't be back!"}
{"text":"At the restaurant I thought the service was poor. There was multiple mistakes and we were served the wrong thing multiple times. We were also served the wrong dishes of fried rice which we decided to eat but, they were different than what waiter told us they were. The tacos were also dry and lacked a lot of flavor. The dessert were not very good either. The tres leches cake was more of a pound cake then a typical tres leches. The best part of the restaurant was the fried rice. That was truly very good with a sophisticated range of flavors."}
{"text":"We were on vacay in Scottsdale and SumoMaya was recommended to us by a friend that lives in the area.  My husband and I went in for happy hour and were pleasantly surprised at the size of the bar, the amount of staff working and the food.  The bar staff was extremely attentive and even took an order of tacos off the bill because they took longer than 20 minutes to come out."}
{"text":"The food is tasty. The guac was great. That being said, the portions are skimpy ($14 for two jumbo shrimp) . The concept of bringing food to the table when it's ready is interesting. However, it doesn't make for a great dining experience. There were five of us. I got my meal first. it was about another 10 minutes until the next person got their meal. Then by the end, we had all finished our meals and the last person at the table hadn't gotten his tuna tacos. We also ordered fried rice with shrimp since the meals are ala carte. We were ready to leave and they still hadn't brought the rice, so we canceled the order. The waitress was nice. The manager came by and listened to our complaints.  All in all, a very mixed dining experience. And not cheap, particularly for the small portions."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  The indoor/outdoor space is beautiful.  Decor outstanding. Great bar with huge t.v.s for watching sports.  Food is good.  Service is o.k.  Good place to check out when you are in town.  Very Trendy. Good girls spot.  Parking is a pain. Valet only."}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by my sister in law... and did not disappoint! Came here on our babymoon, and the bartender at was able to make me some delicious mocktails. The service was impeccable, the food was amazing  (and fast!) and they had a DJ. We came somewhat early so we could drive to Sedona after, but this would be a fun place for a night out due to the club vibe. We would come back just for the pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Friends and I went to the restaurant on a Saturday evening.  The food is outstanding; however, the noise level was deafening because of the volume of the music.  We finally got to the point that we stopped talking to one another because we tired of saying \"What?\"  When the server came over,  I asked for the check, forgoing dessert because we couldn't stand it any more, and she couldn't hear me!  I know that on a Saturday night a restaurant can be noisy due to the conversation levels, but lowering the music was something that was controllable.  This restaurant obviously caters to the 30ish 's or so singles crowd who started coming in to the bar after 9pm, but other patrons deserve an enjoyable dining experience.  When the crowd who wants to go to the newest \"in\" place moves on, how does Sumo Mayo expect to woo back diners who have had such a horrible experience.  The entire situation was nothing short of abusive (and expensive).  Never again."}
{"text":"Amazing service by Josh!  Food was awesome and loved the ambiance.  Definitely will be back!  Great place to watch games during the day!  Gets busy during the weekend evenings with good reason."}
{"text":"It was good, but not quite good enough for the high prices. Also, my sister got the tacos, and they were literally the smallest tacos I had ever seen. She actually had to order another item off of the menu. My noodles were delicious, but a tad overpriced. The sushi is scrumptious, though! The ambience and service were very nice, though."}
{"text":"The wait was 2 hours and their prices were outrageous. The service was terrible and considering the amount of money we spent you think they would be friendly but they were stuck up. I would never recommend this place to anyone!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, great presentation of food.  Cocktails were delicious, as for tacos..meh, it's Arizona and there are others I would recommend first."}
{"text":"We come here all the time whether it be a date night or with a group of friends. It's always an experience. Great food, great environment, and love the service. I've had Kirsten as my server a couple times when here. Always such pleasure, knows the menu well, and great at suggesting different foods. We love her. 10 out of 10 for SumoMaya."}
{"text":"One of the managers of SumoMaya wrote me a Yelp message and instead of apologizing for the poor dining experience he blamed me for going out to eat on a Saturday night. Clearly his staff wasn't able to handle a busy dining room and he suggested that I come in during the week when the restaurant is dead and there's only a handful of tables. Sorry buddy I won't be returning ever."}
{"text":"ORDER THE CHARRED EDAMAME!! It comes with a miso butter that is like  heaven. I ordered a California role and the crab was really fishy and not that good but the edamame and miso butter helped the taste in my mouth. Also their side salad is very good because it has a great spice on it that pops in your mouth! YUM! Great atmosphere and \"club-like\" vibe."}
{"text":"The male bartenders are friendly and attentive. They remember us eavj time we return. Happy hour is awesome! Good vegetarian options too, although Im concerned they cheapened a few thinga now that they're not offering the wild mushroom tacos and puttimg them in the kimchee dish anylonger."}
{"text":"Great combination of South American and Asian cuisine. Took some friends visiting from Chicago for dinner and drinks. They all enjoyed the delicious menu and fun crowd!"}
{"text":"Hands down fantastic. Great happy hour and great food. We had the peppers, Korean tacos, and spicy tuna."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants we've been eating in a long while. We ended up going to this restaurant by \"no choice\" -- all other restaurants were closed at 9 pm...!  So on the way to the restaurant we looked at the menu and made fun of it on the way there -- Mexican-Asian combination? My wife made fun in the car about \"Mexican sushi...?\"  Well, we couldn't be so wrong and ate our hats as we walked into the restaurant. Modern design, high ceiling and perfect lighting leading to most positive atmosphere. And the service -- most pleasant!   We were with our three kids (12, 14 and 17) and felt somewhat out of place with them given this very unique restaurant, but our waiter Frank was amazing. He never let us feel unusual and was great with the kids .   We just finished a 2.5-weeks RV trip and this was an amazing treat for all of us. Food was truly amazing. The combination of flavors was most unique and unusually good! Words cannot describe the unique flavor combination and how much we enjoyed dinner. Just to explain how much we enjoyed the restaurant, it would be sufficient to say that our 17 y.o. daughter asked us to fly her from the east coast to eat here again on her b-day! This is how much we all enjoyed it.  On a personal level -- it would be very difficult for me to eat sushi in a long while since I thought that they had the best sushi I ever ate anywhere!  If you are in the Phoenix are and love to eat I think that this is a must visit restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place looks like it would be fun for happy hour. We went for lunch. I felt it was high-priced for the portions. We had an order of guacamole, which only came with a few chips. When you share that with 3 people, the chips were gone within minutes. Asked for more and we got 3 more, but were also charged for the extra chips. I ordered the Kimchee Fried Rice with a regular iced tea, it was ok. The rice tasted horribly burnt, which ruined the meal. All I could taste was a burnt taste.  Again, for lunch and separate bills I will never understand why my bill for my portion was $25. It was only for my lunch. My friend had the tacos, the size of the tacos were laughable. Within 3 hours of having ate there, we were hungry. Not a filling place. But it looks like it would be fun for drinks. Needs work on the food."}
{"text":"Just got back from an early Friday night drinks and dinner at SumoMaya.  Arrived at 7ish and left at 9:30.  There were four of us.    The good:  The food was great!  Drinks were creative and tasty.  Korean tacos amazing and sushi rolls fabulous.   Service was outstanding.  Decor was cool.  Tree in the middle of the restaurant was inventive and fun!  Had a reservation so no waiting.  Music was hip and loud and made for a dynamic atmosphere.    The bad:  It is a Scottsdale cliche with a high \"ick\" factor.  Husband saw a steroid dude and duck lipped woman leave the men's bathroom stall together at 8:15pm, we had wine spilled on us while we were seated at our table because of an almost bar fight between drunk 50 year olds, and had a front row seat for what looked like a dating scene nightmare.  Kid you not, Godzilla was playing on the big screen over the bar as if to drive home the point.  Felt like I was in a cartoon version of Jersey Shore meets Real Housewives of OC.   If this sounds like your thing, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Needy, greedy, and rude.  Needy and greedy happened before we even got into the restaurant.  The entire parking lot was empty, but coned off for valet.  Not a valet was in sight so we went ahead and parked.  It was like someone said Beetlejuice three times because as soon as we locked the car, a valet magically appeared and demanded the keys because this section - the entire parking lot - was valet only - needy and greedy.  We went into the restaurant, and the hostess told us only the bar seating was open.  We went to the bar area, and all the tables were full, and we didn't want to sit right at the bar.  As we started to head for the door someone walked by and said we could have one of the dinner tables if we wanted, but that section was closed so we told him we would just come back some other time.  At this point everything was still fine.  As we were walking out, we heard the hostess make a disparaging comment about us.  I called the restaurant's manager from the car, and he half heartedly said sorry, but he didn't hear the comment.  Note to manager:  your employees don't act rude and make nasty comments when you're standing there.  Very. Rude.  I don't care how good the food is at this restaurant and I certainly wouldn't know after this experience.  I live in Scottsdale, and there are many excellent restaurants throughout the city.  I will spend my dollars elsewhere.  I don't see this restaurant being a player for long with such a rude, coarse staff."}
{"text":"Style over substance.  Who puts goo over edamame and bakes it to boot?  Fusion?  I guess that's what you can call it but it was a pretty disgustng appetizer.  Go for the sushi.  Very nice.  Don't think you're getting anything by bellying up to the bar during happy hour.  No real discounts here and food choices limited and extremely small portions.  Think I'm kidding? Try the $2.50 per piece chicken tacos ......or dare to ask why the guacamole and chips to \"go with\" are ala carte from one another?  Really? Who doesn't give their clients an equal chips to dip ratio?  These are just chips for goodness sakes.   Commendable Wait Staff-Caitlin.  Everyone else is too busy checking their smart phones.  And yes, the smart phones are smarter than the users....bar waitress was insulting and hostess staff was pretty clueless. Be interestng to see if they are still here in a year. Good luck."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying our waitress was a little too excited for my friends and I and the food we ordered. A little annoying. Also, the chicken taco has a perfumey taste.   With that being said, this place is amazing! The sushi is fresh, the gauc is to kill for, and the beef and pork tacos were well with the trip for. My friends had a couple of drinks that were craftly made that lead to seconds. This is must try!"}
{"text":"GO FOR BRUNCH!  crispy pork belly benedict and unlimited mimosas.....ya...let that marinate."}
{"text":"We go to a new restaurant about once a week and this past Wednesday (6/15/16) we went to try sumomaya. There's a good amount of parking and  it is easily visible from the street.   We walked in at 5pm and asked for a table for 4 people. The hostesses asked us if we had a reservation. We told them we didn't. After a few minutes they said they had a patio table but we would have to be gone by 7pm. We've never been told that we need to leave a restaurant by a certain time so I was a little taken aback. As it was over 100 degrees that day, I told the hostess that I was a bit hesitant to sit outside. She said \"well the musters and the fans are on so its not so hot\". Again, I was hesitant considering the restaurant wasn't super busy. I would say there were probably 20-25 open tables inside at this point. So I asked if there was any other options. After looking at what must have been her reservation list, she said \"okay I do have one table inside but again you have to leave by 7pm\".  I don't know why we didn't leave at this point.   We get seated and our waiter is very nice and attentive. He goes over the menus with us. We order an Ahi Tuna Tostada ($16) appetizer. 20 minutes later the appetizer has not arrived and I'm looking around trying to find our waiter. 5 minutes later a young man comes over and tells us that they are out of that appetizer, I think he said they were out of tostada chips. So we order another one, the Ahi Coconut Tuna Tartare ($18). At this point, I am again wondering why we did not leave.   The food style, per the waiter, is tapas style. Things come out as they are done so some of us got food earlier than others but it wasn't more than 7 minutes from when the first person got their food to the last person.   Ahi Coconut Tuna Tartare - our favorite dish. The ahi tuna is coated in a coconut curry and presented in a coconut shell with 2 plantain chips. Very flavorful. I actually wish they had more plantain chips. The saltiness paired well with the coconut ahi tuna. But for $18, this dish is definitely pricey for the amount you get.   I can only review the two dishes I had which were :  Rock shrimp tempura roll ($15) -  very tasty. Spicy tuna roll with shrimp tempura on top. Good sized roll Mexican Street Corn ($6) - I've had some amazing Mexican street corn and unfortunately this dish did not compare. I think it was a little too acidic compared to what I was expecting.   My husband got  Al Pastor Pad Thai ($14) - it was pretty good. He was a trooper because fusion is not usually his style. It wasn't a hit for him but I appreciated it.   The other people in our party got  Suzuki Roll ($13) - \"awesome\" Spicy Yellowtail roll ($9) - \"really yummy\" Sesame Ginger chicken Taco (2 for $7) - \"so so. Not very flavorful\"  Spicy Tuna Tacos (3 for $12) - \"tasty but very messy to eat in the hard shell\"  And the table shared two desserts  One was like a chocolate cake with a black currant sesame ice cream.  This one was pretty good. ($8). The cake was dense. It usually comes with a salted caramel ice cream but they ran out.   Tres Leches cake ($8). If you are expecting tres Leches cake like your nana made this is NOT it. This cake is much denser than a normal tres Leches dessert. It comes sitting in some sort of sweet condensed milk sauce that is fantastic!  Only wish would be that the sauce was a little thicker. I think if the cake was served a bit warmer it would be a knock out of the park.   After all is said and done we spend $136 (including 3 beers).   FINAL THOUGHTS:  the food is good. They've got some tasty combinations on the menu. Don't come here with picky eaters because they really have no options for them. Be prepared to spend some cash and expect smaller portions than you're probably used to. Reservations are recommended after 7pm. For better pricing go for happy hour between 4 and 6pm but it's only at the sushi bar, the bar, or the patio high tops.   And just so you all know - we walked out of the doors at 7:15pm and there were still 5-7 empty tables."}
{"text":"Great place.  The food is delicious and the people watching is even better.  It can get pricey fast so just be careful on how much you are ordering.  The kinda DJ they have on the weekend nights is lame but the rest of the ambience is nice."}
{"text":"No no no!!! This place is just the worst. Now listen here, I am by no way a cheapskate when it comes to grub. I have many times spent a little over $100 for dinner for two, and when the food is special or just good I have no problem or regrets, but this place???   My wife ordered a chicken fried rice and it was good, as good as you can get at Panda Express or any Teriyaki Bowl place, but it cost double here, $12, no biggie, its a nice place.   I ordered the Tokyo Mule, it was a good drink, just as good as I have gotten at The Vig or any other restaurant bar pretty much... also $12, Ok ok, normally anywhere else they are $8 $9 or $10 tops I understand that they have to pay for the tree inside and the faces on the chairs, understandable.   This is the kicker, I ordered chicken tinga tacos, 2 for $8. Now when you say tacos in the usa my mind goes to the standard taco bell or del taco size soft tortilla. When my plate arrived (see picture attached) my eyes just opened wide, I couldnt belive what I was seeing and my wife looked at me anc chuckled, the \"tacos\" where not even the size of the palm of my hand, one bite literally and they were gone, the taste? Nothing special I cant get at Paquime or any other of the newish midscale hopster mexican food places that have popped up, these were 50 cent tacos at best.  My conclusion?, the tacos really ticked me off, just because you're in Scottsdale doesnt mean you can rip off people, heck! I've been to restautrants in Scottsdale where I have to take a to go box. If you have money to splurge and dont mind overpaying for small portions of food that tou can get somewhere else at lower prices and greater quantities then by all means, come to SumoMaya.  Oh, the service was great! Good fast service."}
{"text":"Really nice place with excelent food. Mexican asian fusion very well achieved. We ordered a rainbow ceviche which was delish and a spicy tuna roll. We also ordered a pastor pad thai which was also very good and filling. The waiters are very nice, very good atention."}
{"text":"My Fiancee and I were contacted by the GM Tai and were asked to come back in hopes of having a better experience. I was impressed by the genuine concern that Tai expressed the first time we spoke.   After returning for a second try my fiancee and I both felt that it was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. The food and service from start to finish was fantastic!   A few highlights:  Tuna and Yellow Tail Sashimi- Great cut, fresh Pomegranate Gauc -Awesome... again!  Suzuki Roll- Delicious, sauce was amazing  ** Wild Mushroom tacos- I must say this was my favorite part of the dinner!  Shaking Beef-  This was my fiancee's favorite! The meat was super tender, flavorful and the perfect amount of spice!  Summer Corn- Light and flavorful and the popcorn on top was a fun touch.  We will definitely be returning and would highly recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my visit here recently on a date.   When you walk in, the interior is very striking with a large, what seems to be an Oak tree replica in the center of the space. Service is excellent. The hostess was very kind, complimented me on my handbag and seated us quickly. Our server was very attentive and inquisitive. He also demonstrated that his skill in recommending a refreshing coconut martini that was quite tasty! My boyfriend and I thought it was also nice that he informed us the portion sizes with the various entrees so that we would pick something that suited us best.   mmmm the beef tacos were so delish!! The meat was so tender and flavorful and it came with a pineapple salsa that was just the right addition."}
{"text":"Oh my god! Absolutely delicious food across the menu. Our server couldn't of been anymore friendly and personable. The food was on point and just exploded in the mouth. Customer service was phenomenal when it came to a small dissatisfaction with a dish. We felt the delicious chips with the guac were a little on the chewy side. They took them back instantly, fixed the issue and comped the item on the bill. I stressed to the server that I was not complaining and didn't feel like it needed special attention but they still took it off the bill. Wow! All around A+.   Hamachi Cerviches is to die for!  By far the best restaurant stop while visiting Scottsdale in the last 4 days. We will be back."}
{"text":"Food was not good- will not go back!!!  The white fish ceviche had a frozen chunk of juice in it, the whole experience was bad.  I could elaborate...my date and I both agreed there are so many better places within a mile of Lincoln and Scottsdale road."}
{"text":"We just had the MOST AMAZING brunch at SumoMaya on Saturday morning! Josh is the most personable, honest, fun, loving, and all around AMAZING incredible server we've ever had! We were with a big group from NYC, LA, Charleston SC, and Miami - all who work in hospitality - and everyone remarked how incredible Josh was. He truly knew how to take care of a large table incredibly well and he honestly started off our Final Four gameday in the BEST Way Possible!!!!! Thank you SumoMaya and JOSH - anyone thinking of coming here - just book it - because it's so amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Their menu is very creative and the tastes are unique. The atmosphere inside is great and on the weekends it's really lively in there. Service is top notch- I have been to this place several times and never had even slightly bad service. Great place if you want to try something new or take friends from out of town!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the atmosphere.  I have eaten here many times and the staff has always been awesome.  I would highly recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a group of friends and I can't wait to come back! On Sundays they have bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, and micheladas for $15. I go the mimosa--you can mix and match flavors like guava, pineapple, blood orange, and mango. We ordered a bunch of stuff so we could try a variety. Dishes not to be missed: the bacon guacamole, the short rib benedict, and the green tea waffles with duck. I will be back soon! Service from LeeAnn was great!"}
{"text":"Amazing brunch, great setting, fun menu, and the best coffee you will find."}
{"text":"I went with a business group and lowered expectations, but sumomaya really surprised to the upside. Very upscale, modern space but casual enough for jeans. Large numbers of housewives and girlfriends of Scottsdale present and decked out. Crowded but we scored seats at the kitchen bar.   Started with a sumorita, frozen margarita concoction that was terrific and terrifically strong. We took the server's suggestion and order a variety of small plates. Although a sushi traditionalist would be horrified, the goofy combinations actually worked very well. The standout dish was the hamachi ceviche. Slightly sweet with a citrus ponzu sauce, caviar saltiness brought it to an exquisite balance. Pad Thai was less successful, but still decent. Didn't have a bad dish.   Was glad this was on expense account, but would bring family on my own dime if we are back this way."}
{"text":"Been meaning to write a review for a while now. I've been to SumoMaya a handful of times and it has been great every time. Some of the drinks need a little work flavor wise, but the food is spectacular. The rock shrimp tempura is delish! The maya roll and the Suzuki roll are great, I can't wait to try more of their sushi. The ceviche is some of the best I've had anywhere. Ahi tuna tostada, the Vietnamese shaking beef and the filet are all amazing. I could go on and on! I can't wait to go back and try more! I also look forward to trying the new dessert menu items as well. Go check it our for yourself, well worth it!"}
{"text":"We went here for a Birthday celebration and had made reservations a couple of weeks prior.  So you can imagine my disappointment when they say us right inside the door at what I would guess was the most poorly lit table.   At first it felt like this place couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to be. A sports bar, a techno dance bar, or a restuarant.   Our waitress Nina turned my initial impressions around. She was so friendly and upbeat and and helpful with with everything from drink selections to menu items.   We started out with rollo chignon sushi roll and the mixto classico ceviche.  Great selections to start your mouth on a delightful culinary adventure. The ingredients are fresh and the blends flavorful. We followed this up with a shishito roll, Korean tacos, pork al pastor tacos, arroz verde, and a apple salmon roll ( which was my personal favorite)  To cap the evening they provided a fun dessert plate with a sparkler!   All of this was gluten free as the birthday girl has celiac's. This restaurant is very accommodating for food allergies.  The final nightcap for me was a creamy vanilla martini that tasted like a birthday cake. Thank you Nina for making that recommendation!   I would definitely return here and recommend this place to anyone wanting to have your tastebuds explode in happiness!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. Came for happy hour and tried sushis, the edamame and craft cocktails. Very beautiful restaurant and good service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We loved the atmosphere here, great ambiance and service was spot on! All 3 servers we interacted with were friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and dropped all they were doing to fill requests. A+ customer service. Food was really good. Much was a little too acidic for our tastes, but we enjoyed it. Food was a B, good enough to want to go back. We had a few of the sushi rolls, the Korean beef tacos, the Chilean sea bass (our favorite), and the shaking beef with rice. Memorable night!"}
{"text":"So over rated!!!  Marginal food at best, small, loud, uncomfortable.....never again."}
{"text":"Great food and ambiance. One tip: please do not shake your Manhattan drinks. It is supposed to be stirred- this goes to three different bartenders making my drinks. Other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"Food was decent. My wife and I came here for her birthday and ordered the crab guacamole and Ceviche. It doesn't compare to a restaurant I just ate at in downtown Phoenix called chico malo. A bit cheaper price point and way better food. Love sumo maya, but it's gonna be hard to come back with a better concept just a few minutes away."}
{"text":"The sushi consisted of tiny bits chopped fish over sushi rice. Half was tofu. Sound level was deafening  We should have walked out and not ordered. Never again. Service slow"}
{"text":"Flavor explosion. I was like a kid in a candy store, I couldn't decide what to order. It was all delicious. Korean tacos, bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates, street corn, pad thai al pastor and Mexican pho, all amazing! The only thing I would not recommend is the Sangria-passion fruit, but bottomless Mimosas were good!"}
{"text":"Went to Sumo Maya yesterday, first time, for an early dinner. We sat at the bar and had a great time, chatting with the bartender, Jonathan, who not only made amazing margs but also gave us some wonderful recommendations on his favorite dishes! We ordered the Ecuadorian shrimp ceviche, Rollon Chingon sushi roll, apple-salmon sushi roll and carmelized plantains. Each dish was nicely prepared all with fresh ingredients! My friend ordered the spicy peach marg and I got the perfect patron marg. Both sooo yummy!! Also loved the vibe and ambience. I highly recommend this place and I will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"HORRID!!! As we were walking into the restaurant, we saw the hostess coming to help open the door. We thought she was doing this to greet us but she was really doing this to scream to her friends coming in after us. She didn't even say hello to us or acknowledge us. Okay fine. Then she's so busy still chatting up her friends that we were standing and waiting for her to ask us how many were in our party. Finally, after almost 15 minutes of waiting for her to finish, she begrudgingly took us to our table. No apologies for waiting or anything. We sit at a table and wait and wait and wait. We are very, very patient. Finally, a server comes to take our drink order and we ask for the menu. Then wait and wait some more. He brings the drinks over but doesn't take our food order. He also has an attitude meaning no pleasantries or even a smile! A new server comes along and takes our food order with no attitude. He checked on us and he was pleasant. But after all the waiting and the bad attitudes, we will never go back again. The food is only mediocre so it's not worth paying to have bitchy employees ruin your evening."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor is the only good thing about this restaurant.  My friend and I like to try new restaurants and SumoMaya was a HUGE disappointment.  It started with the hostess.  She acted annoyed that we walked in.  Asked if we were there for happy hour or dinner.  We said it was our first time in and were not sure.  She shoved one happy hour menu at us, told us where to sit for happy hour or dinner and turned her back to us.  Did NOT seat us.  And her job is what?  Wait staff was indifferent.  I ordered a cocktail, I am not a bartender and I make a better drink.  It was awful.  We ordered dinners and our food did not come out together I had to ask where my friends dinner was.  I had the Tamarind Shrimp.  Way too much sauce and salt.  Vegetables were non-existent and there were only 3 shrimp.  The best part of the dish was the white rice.  YIKES.  My friend had the \"Crispy\" Pork Belly Roll.  I had a piece.  \"crispy\" NO.  Sweet and sour plums (? where), chicharron, brussel sprout \"coleslaw\" (? again, where), plum wine sauce (a smattering).  So disappointing.  Will not go back and my friend felt so bad because it was her pick."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food.  Jennifer S. our server was awesome. She really enhanced our evening.  Thx!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally went to dinner with another couple. Honestly, the food was some of the BEST I have had in a long time. Seriously, the food was awesome and the service was very good. I probably won't go back, however. Now this is something I have seen in other reviews and I don't understand why the manager doesn't do something about this very fixable complaint...turn down the damn music! Why does it need to be so loud? You literally end up shouting to others at the table. One of my friends asked the hostess if they could turn it down, but we were pretty much ignored. Again, what is the point? There is no dance floor, it is definitely not a 'club' scene. Who are they trying to appeal to? Oddly enough, the music they were blasting was from the 80's. I loved the music (a sign of my age) but the twenty somethings that were there might not have. Regardless of the music genre, please turn it down!"}
{"text":"Booked an 8:30 reservation for 9 people not knowing the restaurant closed at 9. At 9:30 we were told last call for food and alcohol. They were not willing to stay open to accommodate us knowing weeks ahead with a pre ordered menu we were here for a bachelorette party. Service was rushed and unorganized. Drinks were brought out one at a time and plates were cleared slowly albeit being finished for a long time. Had to ask multiple times for water refill. Food was decent but, disappointing experience overall."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and service. I highly recommend SumoMaya if you haven't already been."}
{"text":"Place was nice and well decorated. Got sat right away.  Service was excellent. Food took a while to get to the table over 45 min. With my mexican pho taking the longest at 55 min and when it came it was overly salty. Spicy crab roll was GREAT. Manager came over and addressed the wait and food. Def will be back."}
{"text":"Innovative fusion cuisine that works combined with amazing service thanks to Mike.  This is a fun place with good food and great service."}
{"text":"A perfect brunch experience.  Great service, really good food AND drinks. Great value with the $30 for brunch."}
{"text":"Amazing ambience, great job of bringing the outside inside. Friendly bar staff, very attentive, never an empty glass.  Food was a great value especially at happy hour.  Definitely would make this place a must while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I don't have anything negative to say about this place. My friend Toby works here so I'm slightly biased but for good reasons. Yes, this place is TRENDY and fits right into Scottsdale. Come dressed up! Love the comp. valet! Great service all around! The reverse happy hour starts later then most places though, but not a big deal. I had some of the freshest salmon here in my roll and the rice was still warm when it was served! I loved each of their tacos, as well. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful.  My wife and I are big time foodies, and I can honestly say everything we tried was delicious.  Guacamole w crab....yes please.  Suzuki roll w chipotle aoli, also delicious.  We ended w a paella dish that was off menu that our waiter recommended that included chicken, shrimp, and chorizo....phenomenal.  Will be heading back very soon!"}
{"text":"Great service and food! Ceviche of the day was so good and mussels are amazing! Get extra bread to soak up that sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Asian Mexican food could be so delicious combined. The outstanding drink list, menu, bartenders, & service! Highly recommend this place. Try the sushi and Green Magic Mojito. our server was a little frantic as she was tending to half of the tables in the restaurant as well as ours but she was so nice and friendly. The only thing we didn't like is the manager, that evening, was not treating the server nicely and we did not know who to complain about him to. But everything else was perfect. we would def go back."}
{"text":"The place lives up!! From the food to the valets. The food is great and arrived at lightening speed!  even on a packed night! (That alone got it 3 stars, take a lesson rivals) Bar is stacked with a good selection of liquor  and awesome craft cocktails.  Value is definitely there! For the price and speed I would go again in a second! Give this place a go and you wont regret it. Well done suma maya!! this place is on fire"}
{"text":"Great bartender, christine, friendly and great attitude....music is terrible however. Guaranteed headache."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and eat here!  This place has got it going on!!!  We ordered lots of things to share and each dish was more delicious than the next!  My favorites were the summer corn, pad thai al pastor, strawberry gazpacho, and the tuna ceviche.  Also, the mochis were delicious, my favorite flavor was the passion fruit.  There are not enough superlatives in the English language to describe the taste and quality of the food.  The service was excellent.  Our waitress Danielle was so friendly, knowledgable of the menu, conscientious of dietary restrictions, and generally good at her job.  We spoke to the general manager, who took an active interest in our experience.  Definitely one of the best meals I've had in the Phoenix area.  We'll be back the next time we're in town.  Like another reviewer said:  foodie fusion heaven!"}
{"text":"Ok, I wanted to give this place another chance since I had no problems before except the music was too loud and we weren't seated until 45 minutes after our reservation. Saturday early afternoon. The manager Jason (Mahalo) reached out to me after my less than raving 3-star review. This time I took my  23-year-old son who has a sensitive stomach-you  could say he was the guinea pig!  SumoMaya now offers a bottomless brunch, score! (the old menu is still available-just ask). We sampled many of the different brunch choices from drinks to appetizers to desserts-it was all covered, and then some! Brunch is a lot of food- so pace yourself! There was a huge selection of drinks including very unique combos. The 3 Leches Oatmeal Brulee, pomegranate guacamole and chips, and assorted sushi rolls. The enchiladas suizas were PERFECTO! Dessert...mmmm liquid cheesecake brulee with marinated berries...need I say more? Stomachs-ok, music level tolerable, and there was no wait to be seated. Round 2 was a winner! There isn't any other restaurant quite like SumoMaya!"}
{"text":"Loved the food. So why 3 stars? The music is so loud that we can't hear or talk. My husband is hard of hearing, and we asked them to please turn it down. They did and then turned it back up again. The walls are hard so the noise bounces off the walls. Unfortunately, we've gone 4 times, and the noise was worse each time. We won't be able to return."}
{"text":"We love this place. Service is great and the food is awesome. We usually do brunch with our kids and there is always room for our family of 6. This is one of our favs."}
{"text":"I was here today to celebrate a special occasion and the valet guys pissed me off so much that I left and went elsewhere. We were about to park at a valet spot by mistake and one of the guys just came running as if we had just killed someone and said we couldn't park here. So we went around wondering what was wrong with him and tried to find self parking. He again came running around and placed a valet parking sign in front of our car blocking us from getting to the other side of the parking lot. And he just walked away. Seriously? Who does this? Never coming back and don't care if I miss out on good food"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night for a date. The music was very loud. I'm good with music, but I would like to be able to talk to my date across the table.   The service was acceptable. I have nothing to complain about or praise.   The food was not worth the price. We didn't even finish most of our plates. I love the tapas style and trying multiple dishes. The pork belly was the only good part of the meal. We also had the guacamole with pomegranates and street corn which were alright. The pad Thai, ahi tacos, and the roll we had (had mango salsa on it) were not very good.    I will not be hurrying back to SumoMaya."}
{"text":"So yummy!!! Everything there is good! Not to mention the fun cocktails. The service was excellent. For sure going back soon."}
{"text":"Spent $125 to watch Final Four game. With four minutes left in the game they change the channel to baseball. I complain about it and so they throw me out (after I paid my tab of course). As they throw me out the manager proceeds to berate me for being old? Nice."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience. I stayed at the Hilton across the street and saw the restaurant sign on my way back from my meeting. The concierge gave it high praise and I had to come and check it out.  I LOVED IT!! Loved the food. Loved the bar staff (Dez and Jonathan). Loved the drinks. I've got you say that first glance from outside gave me pause. There are huge screens hanging over the bar with sports turned on.  $@:&#! I HATE TV's in restaurants and I TRIPLE HATE loud sports noise. But...Pleasant surprise. I didn't have to look at the screens when I sat under them  at the bar. TRIPLE PLEASANT SURPRISE... No noise from the TVs. They were playing super cool music. The kind that sort of puts me in a special happy mood. Like the kind you'd hear if you were boarding a Virgin America flight to Paradise with your BFF. The staff was so damn friendly that I nearly fell off my seat. Instant chemistry. The look and feel of the place was beyond my idea of perfection. Clean. Modern. Cool. Crisp. Light. Light.  Light. There was light in the damn place. Owners/managers: dark is Not cool. It's just fucking dark. I was alone but the noise levels were so perfect that I could easily carry on a convo with the bar tender and folks next to me. Sooooo much better than the ear splitting, jet engine noise of DC restaurants. Owners/managers: loud is not cool. Loud is just fucking loud. Stop it already. This place was idyllic. The food was amazing. I had the Rock Shrimp Tempura Roll and the Chinese Style Chile-Crab Garlic Noodles. Both delicious. But the atmosphere at 6 pm on a Monday night would have made up for anything. I couldn't resist the Chicken TingaTaco for dessert. Three (or was it four) special rum drinks later (as specially made by Jonathan) and I was ready for bed. I didn't even notice the bill. I was king for a night, but all good things must come too an end."}
{"text":"I had no idea this place existed until last week!!! Cane for the bottomless mimosas and breakfast and it was surprisingly great food. Kind of small portions but it was really good food. 6 different flavors of mimosas makes for a Sunday Funday!!"}
{"text":"This place was a complete surprise. Mexican and Asian? I thought it sounded strange but the food was delicious! I had sushi with a latin flair and the drink was yummy too. The place is comfortable and the servers polite and interesting. I have returned two times and plan on going back."}
{"text":"Just got back for the winter about three weeks ago, and headed right back to Sumo Maya.  What a disappointing visit!  What the heck have they done to their tacos???  I'm a fairly petite person, not looking for huge portions at all.  But the new taco size here, at least on the fish, is absurd - especially at the price.  These are the tiniest little tacos I've ever seen, when the waitress brought the plate I just stared at it I disbelief.  She saw, and volunteered that she'd been getting lots of negative feedback.  What makes it worse is that the fish tacos used to be wonderful.  They took a good thing and ruined it.  And my margarita tasted like it was watered down.  Seems like a lot of cost cutting measures going on, and it shows in very negative ways.  On the positive side, the charred edamame is still delicious and addictive.  This place used to be a favorite of mine, but based on my recent visit, I'm not likely to go back any time soon."}
{"text":"Meh... so many better options for sushi or brunch in Scottsdale.  Decor cool but, no reason to pay for food with so many issues from served cold, to enchiladas missing cheese, to pieces of paper from the kitchen food ticket in your meal.  May have been a one time flop but, enough to keep our group away due to other choices in area with supreme service and food."}
{"text":"I always like to start with the good so I will say that this place offers great people watching and the gawking factor definitely gets high marks. If you are looking to drink cocktails and view the work of Scottsdale's finest plastic surgeons, this is the place for you. If you are expecting a nice restaurant, not so much.   We arrived at the restaurant and it appeared that there was only valet parking available. At first we were ignored, but were finally informed that valet parking was closed. However, it was open to the BMW behind us. Thankfully we were not driving an old car or they might have called the police to remove our apparent poorness from the parking lot.   We stepped inside the restaurant where the DJ stands next to the host. Apparently this is a warning that loud techno music will inhibit patrons' ability to have a conversation. I told the host that we had a reservation for 7:30 pm and he said that it was for 6 pm and they couldn't hold the table that long. There was some back and forth here as I explained that someone from our party received a confirmation call from the restaurant earlier that day for the reservation we had for 7:30. In the end, the host was only a little condescending and that could be my fault because I didn't get the memo about this being a \"dress-up\" kind of restaurant and arrived wearing business casual.   After about a 30 minute wait, we were seated at a table so small that four of us were seated on the corners and we were so close to the bar behind us that every time a server walked by we all got bumped. Our server arrived to take our drink order and we, all 10 of us, were trying to get a look at the cocktail menu. We asked for an additional cocktail menu but were told there were no more.   Our entrees arrived one at a time and every food and drink item was delivered by a server standing at the head of the table and yelling \"Who ordered the___!!\" That was fantastic as we must have ordered 40 things between drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Considering the price of the food, I think I can reasonably expect the wait staff to remember to which position the food should be delivered.   As for the food itself, some things were good, like the tacos and the rock shrimp. Some things were really bad, like the ramen and the chicken mole. The portions were small, but this was expected.   There are some really fantastic restaurants in Scottsdale where you can get awesome food and excellent service. Also, you can generally get a viewing of the same beautiful people just about anywhere in Scottsdale. Go to the places where you can get the 3-in-1."}
{"text":"Such different food but it's all amazing. I haven't ordered anything I didn't like. Their drinks are also phenomenal. I would recommend using the complementary valet, the parking lot does get crowed after 5pm."}
{"text":"The only option for Sunday brunch is bottomless food: unlimited of each starter and one entree for $29, plus $10 if you want bottomless drinks. You can not just order and entree or a side. I cannot honestly eat $30 worth of food, even after hiking up Camelback. This was not explained very well by the hostess or our server. It explains why they were not crowded at all. The menu looks great and I was really excited to try, but not enough choices, in fact only one choice...everything."}
{"text":"Went the other night as a party of 6 to celebrate my birthday.  I hadn't been there since it opened so I was pleased to find that the food had actually improved in the meantime.  My friends love food and have great appetites so we tried several different dishes.  Two friends are vegan and shared their dishes and said that they enjoyed most of their meal.  They especially liked the kimchee fried rice.   The rest of us shared a plethora of dishes.  My favorites were the saut√©ed eggplant and the rock shrimp appetizer.  We also enjoyed the pork belly ramen.  The broth was smoky and delicious.   Friends had the rock shrimp sushi roll but said that the tuna in the roll took away from the shrimp itself.  The rock shrimp appetizer was so delicious and you could taste the truffle oil.  We also had the Korean beef tacos which were good and the tempura cod tacos, which I would probably pass on next time.  The pairing with sauce, veggies didn't quite fit.  Our server was as friendly as could be however I think she became a little too busy for us as the night went on.  She forgot to tell us that the kitchen was out of the sea bass which we ordered and only found out about after we realized we missed it at the end of the meal.  Some of the other servers and hosts came to help serve dishes and were somewhat attentive during that time, although we did have to ask for a few things multiple times from different servers before we received them.  Overall the food was great.  My out-of-town friends really enjoyed the meal and experience so I'm happy I chose this restaurant for our celebration!"}
{"text":"This was my second time here, food and experience was great the first time but this time, not so much.  To start they use to carry Azule Ultra, no one else carried it and that was the entire reason we went there.  They no longer carry it but that's not a huge deal because last time the food and great service made up for it.  This time the food was ok and the server was a goof but did a good job.  Later that night three of the 6 people that ate there got very sick.  I can't be sure but I think it was the food at this location."}
{"text":"Craving Mexican so stopped for dinner on Wednesday night without reservations.  Although there seemed to be open seats, we had the option of the bar or the kitchen bar. Opted the kitchen bar with seats overlooking the chefs.   Turns out that SumoMaya is an Asian-Mexican fusion restaurant. (Makes total sense once you look at the sign and the decor.)  With an eclectic menu that our server explained was small plates that are to be shared and served as they are ready.  I was with a Vegan who doesn't eat anything with \"eyes\" so that limited our selections.   Started with the house margarita. It was ok - a bit pricey for the size but that was the theme of the menu.  The guacamole was good. It was served with tortilla rounds covered in a nice spice!  The roasted mushrooms were covered in a lovely Vietnamese caramel sauce. We split our choices at this point - he had the Vegetable Lo Mein and I had the Carnitas Taco.  The taco portions were tiny but with the two other items, it made a meal.   We didn't opt dessert but from our seats, we watched the Tres Leches cake being prepped and it looked great!!  If you're looking for quiet conversation, this place isn't the best. The large open room allows conversations to carry.  It's the perfect place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Really fun venue and we especially enjoy the Brunch.  Excellent concept; priced right.  I am a Concierge and I recommend AND personally dine at this venue."}
{"text":"SumoMaya is our new favorite place. We have been there twice now and have had the best service, and food we have had in a long time! The summer corn, edamame, Korean beef tacos and Pad Thai are to die for. Chef Herb Wilson personally came to our table to make sure our meal was perfect. When you go in make sure you ask for Austin, he was the best server. He is very attentive and makes amazing recommendations based on what you like. We can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu. A+++"}
{"text":"Well unfortunately I was disappointed with the service here. It was my first time coming to this restaurant last night. We ate here for my best friends 21st birthday and the service was not to par. Very slow unfortunately. Also, I understand that the restaurant is really nice and fancy but the food was disappointing. I order avocado rolls. It came with 6 rolls the size of dimes and charged way more than they were worth. The overall experience was not what we were expecting"}
{"text":"We have been excitedly awaiting the opening of this restaurant for a few months now. We finally tried it for lunch today and unfortunately we were dissapointed. The food was just okay and the service was definitely lacking. We ordered the guacamole and it was extremely salty. In all fairness when we complained about it they took it back but unfortunately the one they brought out was also super salty. I suggest that they train their servers better so they can answer questions about items offered on their menu specially for people with food allergies. Maybe they were just having an off day. We may try them again in the future."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour, large group gatherings, and to enjoy great fusion food. Have loved it every time - all the sushi is delicious. Drinks are also unique and delicious - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic."}
{"text":"I went here with one of my best friends & we had a blast! Great music ! Tasty food! The service was great!  We ordered a bunch of food & shared everything! It was packed so I was so glad they take reservations!  The location is perfect for hitting old town after! :-)"}
{"text":"Love the food! It's definitely the best of both cultures. Interesting combinations & multidimensional flavors. My only complaint would be how noisy it can get. I won't go back on a Friday night, it required shouting across the table & we were only 4!  Eat outside for a chance to relax & talk to your dinner companions. Food is fantastic so will go on non hip evenings."}
{"text":"Walking in what a great atmosphere!  But...soft shell sushi roll was bland and not fresh.  Shrimp appy had not been cleaned up properly and had \"extras\" on it.  Ask for green tea - came cold first then the hot was gross.  I had the pad tai and it was tasty but have had better.  Server was friendly but seemed to be a lot of $ for what we got.  Great TV's for the game but maybe stick to the Mexican food???  Won't be back or recommend it."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go out and enjoy a mixture of delicious food with good music and company! Went here for my 23 birthday and I couldn't have picked a better place to celebrate before going out to the clubs!"}
{"text":"Ok, I love this place already but tonight proved why I come here. We order a bunch of food and one of our dishes (sushi) took forever. The server, Eric, kept checking on us to see if we got our food, then the manager, John, came to explain the sushi bar was behind and asked if he could get us anything. Then it took even longer and he came back to apologize and offer us drinks. At this point we were more impressed by the staff as a whole than we were mad about the food not coming. End of story the food came, it was awesome as always, and they did the right thing by keeping the communication open. This is why businesses are successful; great people working for them! Thank you Christine, Alissa, Eric, and John!!   Come to Sumo Maya!!k"}
{"text":"Perfection in Scottsdale!  Perfect food, perfect ambiance, and uber perfect service by the extraordinary Jordan!  Props to him for going above and beyond!  SumoMayo is extremely fortunate to have such an asset.  Thank you for a great evening! Caramel and cappuccino!"}
{"text":"Went there Friday for meal of 8.  Very noisy, loud music also.  A place for the young at heart or just young.  They suggest you share dishes. The catch is: they want you to buy more meals.  For a table of 4, they might suggest 6 entrees or you better be light eaters."}
{"text":"Great environment at the bar for happy hour. I had the Michelada with Pacifico and it was tasty. I tried the edamame and had the Large Shrimp for dinner. All very delicious and not too filling."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's so good and a great vibe.  Our 2nd time here.  I recommend sitting at the chef table if you are a small party.  What a great place"}
{"text":"Been a while since I've been there, but I didn't get what all the hype was about. It was definitely a unique meal, but nothing really that good. Coupled with the high prices for mediocore taste trying to be some sort of fusion that wasn't really working, not my favorite place."}
{"text":"The food is so eclectic and it is all delectable. Just be aware that it is loud in a lively way so if you prefer a little quieter spot request away from the bar.  It's a cant miss place in my opinion"}
{"text":"Love the tostadas that come with the guacamole. Thought my avocado salad was ok. Sushi was good but no better than Raw or Sapporo. Also, not crazy about the decor. A bit too much for my taste."}
{"text":"I have been to Sumo Maya twice now and both times was phenomenal. You know how people say your wedding day is the happiest day of your life? Well Sumo Maya is better. Period.   I split a meal with a coworker of mine and every plate we got was better than the last.  Let me start with the lump crab guac with homemade tortillas. The crab was perfectly cooked and extremely fresh. I felt like they went into the ocean to get this crab and chopped it right out of the water. The handmade tortillas were so soft and warm and such a great pairing with the cold crab and guac.  Next we shared the pork belly ramen. I felt like I should have been in a japan. The broth was rich and the noodles were ala dente. The pork belly was fatty but that is the main reason one gets the pork belly. It was so juicy I was angered I only got 2 pieces.  We finished our meal with the duck breast served Mid Rare with pickled veggies. The Duck melted like butter in your mouth and there were hints of truffle oil on the outside.  Hands down best meal of my life."}
{"text":"I was there this past Sunday morning and thought I walked into a nightclub during the day. The vibe is relaxed, but the food was not what I expected. I think they appeal more to the early twenties crowd. I would go back for their evening menu but not on Sundays again."}
{"text":"By far one of my most favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. I really like their small tacos and the fact that they offer different types of foods. I love the trees that are planted in the middle of the restaurant, which gives the restaurant interesting atmosphere. Also the servers are very nice and interactive."}
{"text":"First time here, came for lunch. The place looks nice and clean, with a couple big screen TVs by the bar. The prices are what you would expect for a place in Scottsdale, but for lunch it was a little expensive, even for Scottsdale. I got the foie gras + eel roll, and a piece of mackeral sashimi and uni. The uni and roll were alright, nothing spectacular about either of them. But the mackerel sashimi was just terrible. I get sushi for lunch frequently, and mackeral sashimi or nigiri is usually something I always get. It should be a little moist, and it should look shiny and fresh...this piece looked like it had been cooked because it looked curled up like how it might look if it was left on the grill for a few seconds. It did not have the texture and taste it should have, quite frankly, the mackeral sashimi was gross.  This place isn't awful, and I've only been here once and tried a few things, but I highly doubt I'll be back. The food isn't terrible,  it just doesn't justify the prices that they charge..."}
{"text":"Was recommended to this restaurant by a friend.  My sis and I went in for a much deserved long lunch together and had the best time.  Our server Kellan took excellent care of us and helped by bringing us some of his fav's... we started with the pumpkin seed topped guacamole that was served with small tostada-like chips with a great spice on them... then we had the bacon wrapped medjool dates - delicious, rich, but too much for a party of 2 I must say as they were pretty filling... and lastly he brought us the mushroom tacos that were amazing!  Super fresh soft homemade tortillas wrapped around mushroom-y deliciousness!  Wish I weren't so full as I would have ordered another round of those!  Oh, did I mention the Sumo-Rita?  That was over the top delicious and worth every penny!!  I thought the menu was reasonably priced for what you got.  I will most definitely be back!  Good job guys!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I have never had anything bad as far as food goes.  The service...not so great.  I brought a friend from out of town here for lunch(the place was almost empty), considering I had been raving about the guacamole with lump crabmeat for days.  Ordered fresh tortillas to accompany...waited, and waited, and waited.  The guacamole was finished before they ever came. I was sitting on a wall and there was a huge delivery truck parked right behind me that left the engine running almost the entire meal.  It sounded like a jackhammer going off behind my head. No one really apologized, they just said he would move soon. The music was loud.  I got a headache.  My friends lunches came, and I waited, and waited, and waited some more for my soup.  They were finished before I ever received mine.  Is the food good? yes.  Is it the best in town?  No.  I suggest cruising on your 15 minutes of fame while the going is strong, because when you aren't the new, hot restaurant anymore...it's going to be time to improve on a few things."}
{"text":"This is a super fun experience.  I've only been here for brunch but it's a great experience and I would definitely recommend it.  The cuisine is a Mexican-Asian fusion but not in a weird fried sushi with queso type of way.  I've had a couple of different sushi rolls, a breakfast dish, a fried rice dish, and my favorite - the ahi tuna tostada.  Everything here tastes super fresh with tons of flavor.  It's one of those menus where I feel you can't go wrong with what you order, plus there's something for everyone - fresh fish sushi, tacos, vegetarian options, breakfast, etc. all available on the brunch menu.  I've been here between 10-noon and it's also not super busy allowing for excellent service.  Lastly, they have bottomless drinks particularly mimosas including different flavors which are fun and delicious."}
{"text":"Incredible menu - both how it is structured (unlimited sides, apps, deserts) and terrific main entr√©e selections.  $10 unlimited mimosas as well.  Great service, super fun environment - there was a DJ/band there for brunch when I visited.  Very swanky, come dressed on trend.  Vegas vibe."}
{"text":"Wow, first time here. Visiting from NYC, so you can say I know good food. This place is unbelievable. You truly get your bang for your buck. The food and atmosphere is great for a girls brunch, family brunch or even eating alone. The staff is incredible. It's so busy, yet they are attentive, helpful, and fun.   We had a lot of dairy restrictions in our party- everything from vegetarian, nut allergy, diary diary- and our AMAZING waitress Jordyn completely accommodated all requests without sacrificing the foods' taste. Ask for her, she's the best with recommendations and accommodations.   I highly recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"It makes me sad to say, that I did not love this place. I really wanted to.  The atmosphere was awesome, and the concept of Asian and Mexican fusion is one that I generally can rally around. However, the items that we ate last night were just... Meh.   I had the coconut cocktail which was the standout item. It was AWESOME.   My boyfriend had the jalape√±o monk to drink which was just... Odd. Not good. He sent it back.   To eat, we had the hamachi and shishito rolls. Both were lackluster. Not bad, but not especially flavorful.   We also had the ahi tuna tostada. This was actually really delicious.  The last thing we got was the Korean beef tacos. Another bland item.   For $100, I really do expect to be impressed. Call me old fashioned. Sumo Maya, you just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Update: it turns out they do take reservations but were completely full the night I was there. Definitely recommend getting a reservation if you can!"}
{"text":"One word for the all you can eat brunch... AMAZING!   Service was great and food came out relatively fast for how busy they were.   I will be coming back whenever I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"An interesting room and restaurant concept. Every plate had a complex taste and was delicious. Unexpectedly, our favorite plate was the Mexican Corn. The Bacon Guacamole was also very good. The cocktails were interesting and the service was attentive."}
{"text":"The food is good. However, the customer service is dismal. Went there for dinner, everything went smoothly, till the next day I noticed they had charged me an extra $125. My meal came out to 130 after tip; but at the same time they ran my card on another tab charging me the extra $125 and instead of being notified right away, I wasn't notified at all and had to see on my own. When you call the place, they tell you to email their GM Jason who takes all day and didn't even respond because they were busy with brunch, yet it took them 5 seconds to run my card twice. And after calling a couple times, his only response in an insipid manner was that \"it happens\"."}
{"text":"What could be better than Mexican Asian fusion and a great Happy Hour?  The food selections were quite interesting and very good, very attentive staff, cool atmosphere.  Complimentary valet parking if you desire.  I liked the Korean tacos with kimchee and pretty much everything I sampled.  Some good options for vegetarians too.   I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Let's start with the pros.   The tacos al pastor were well executed although the tortilla was crumbly. I assume that they were fresh made and if the dough gets a little dry, that's the outcome. I would also get rid of the avocado.  The bacon guacamole was also good.  I asked for a sample of the strawberry gazpacho and it was tasteful but I guess a whole bowl would be really overwhelming. A shot is the perfect size for this dish, IMHO.  The bacon wrapped dates... mixed feelings.  And the porkbelly ramen noodles was highly disappointing.   The location is awesome, the build out is beautiful and it has a great patio. I was tempted to give them a 4th star just for that, but I guess I would be bias and would mislead whoever reads this.  However I say, give it a try. I will go back to try the sushi.  Cheers."}
{"text":"We tried a lot of different things, and for the most part enjoyed them.  There were a few (drinks and sushi) that we did not care for, but we were ordering adventurously.  I would have given 3 stars, but the service earned an extra.  The items we didn't care for never even showed up on our bill without us even asking.  That is more than I was expecting.  Everything was well presented, and the tree was cool."}
{"text":"Great decor & creative kitchen! But very pricey and know they are working on improving service/staff."}
{"text":"Diverse, loud and electric. These are the words that describe the atmosphere at this funky and eclectic restaurant, which can also be considered a cocktail lounge or a sushi bar, depending on where you sit.     The service was excellent and the food was unique on a multilayered perspective; from presentation to complex flavors.       If you're looking for a one of a kind experience from atmosphere to food, try this place."}
{"text":"Great service! My first time here as a new person to AZ.i sat at the bar and Matt was amazing! Very engaging and his recommendations were spot on! Had the Korean beef tacos and pork al pastor tacos and would get them again along with the Calamari and edamame....and his old fashion was on target! This will be a regular on my list of AZ faves :-)"}
{"text":"Wow pretty amazing find!! So many choices...you have to try the guacamole and the Sizzling Chaufa Rice...Service was excellent as well."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in town for sushi! I'm from Boston so I haven't found many places that serve great fish/sushi in my opinion, but SumoMaya's quality is wonderful and nothing is fishy! I love their specialty rolls, but my favorites are the Philadelphia Roll and Spicy Tuna. You would never know we're land locked! The pomegranate guac is also my favorite app...it's a must try. It's unique and covers sweet and salty. My boyfriend and I love it so much, we've remade our own at home several times."}
{"text":"Love this place. Trendy chic & the food is excellent. You can get \"foodie\" Mexican food, as well as Sushi with very cool Trance Vibe Music playing in background. If going during busy hours: dinner/Hh & want a table, reservations recommended. Also, used to have all you can drink Mamosas on Sunday for $15. Ummmm... yes, more, please. Thank you"}
{"text":"First time there and it was fantastic! Nick was a great server very friendly yet professional, gave me great menu options & ensured my overall experience was great !"}
{"text":"So had to up date my review and down grade to two stars.  Its been quite a while since I've been here and I couldn't remember why,  then once I sat down it all came back.     To start I made the unfortunate choice of getting a table.  Although only 10 feet from the bar and high top tables,  by some strange mystery happy hour doesn't apply.  Higher overhead costs I assume.  When I asked the server why,  she said she didn't know that's just the way the owner wanted it.  So it literally would have saved me 50% on drinks and appetizers just to order them from the bar and bring them back to my table. We just decided to order neither.  If the restaurant wants to make it difficult to enjoy happy hour then no reason to come early... or maybe at all.   Not much else has changed.  The place and employees continually remind you how cool they are and how lucky toy are to be here.  I give up cool a long time ago,  so maybe spend money where cool is not required.   In fairness,  here was my prior review: Really a 3 1/2 stars, a little above average. Great ideas, good sushi, but trying a little too hard to be different. Food is fresh and tastes good. But there are a lot of restaurants in Scottsdale that have the same. It is very popular. My wife would probably rate higher."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night to a very clubby vibe. Asian fused with Mexican influences. Start with rock tempura and tuna tartar. Miso glazed sea bass, lobster crab dynamite and the filet are good, but not spectacular. Go for a visual scene and big screen tvs hanging over the centerpiece bar."}
{"text":"WOW!  Went with a group of 6 people and it was so much fun sharing dishes and great atmosphere.  Fun with a big group and every single thing that I tried, I loved.  Really great for trying new things and even more fun with a group.  As we were leaving, we saw a lot of young, singles coming into the bar.  Looked fun also!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is HILARIOUS.  Vacationed in Scottsdale for the first time this past Memorial Day weekend on a whim because my boyfriend and I wanted to get out of LA. Came here for our first dinner in Scottsdale and it's like we were right smack in the middle of douchebaggy West Hollywood (the exact type of scene we were trying the escape). I literally walked in, heard the top 40 music BLASTING over the entire restaurant and it took every ounce of strength in me to simultaneously hold back my laughter and tears.  Anyway, we decided to stay because idk maybe it was my fault for not reading the reviews thoroughly enough to figure out that this was like some sort of tacky wannabe club/lounge-type restaurant that thinks it's in Hollywood. We only waited about 10 minutes to be seated by the sushi bar, so we were like ok cool, let's just eat and get the FUCK out of here.  We ordered: -Al pastor tacos: the sizes of these tacos are joke right? Like, you guys can't actually be serious? 2 tacos for $8 when you can go to a taco truck and get one for $1 that is double the size. I'm hella offended. -Maya roll: the only decent item we ordered, but definitely not worth $15 -Chinese chili garlic noodles: tasted like spicy dry ramen noodles and the portion was so small + it took about 30 minutes to come out.  We weren't even that hungry when we got there but neither of us were satisfied after ordering 3 dishes, which would typically be enough at any other restaurant... right? We would have ordered another item, but we didn't want to feed this establishment any more money than we needed to and also wanted to leave ASAP.  I must admit that it was definitely priceless watching middle-aged yuppies go completely batshit over the basketball game while ordering $50 sushi rolls with gold flakes???? Also enjoyed watching the table of literal senior citizens across from us trying to have a nice dinner with Drake's \"Hotline Bling\" blaring out of the sound system. Thank you SO much for the snapchat content!   To my surprise, a restaurant can concurrently be obnoxious, absurdly loud, incredibly over-priced, unreasonably slow, and also have TINY portions! Honestly, I'm impressed with how they seem to still draw a crowd of patrons who seem to be completely oblivious to exactly how much they are being ripped off."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience! We ordered shishito peppers, street corn, spicy crab roll and pork \"Al Pastor\" Pad Thai. It was all amazing. The Mexican and Asian fusion is a very unique and excellent twist on classic dishes. For the Pad Thai, the mild was very flavorful and a comfortable level of spice to enjoy without being overwhelmed. I would personally try medium next time. The spicy crab roll was not spicy at all for me, but it was still very tasty and I would still recommend it. Our waiter was also great and made great recommendations. I just wish we were locals or they would have gone through with their Houston expansion."}
{"text":"Food here is really really good and the pokey martini that I'm not sure if they still serve was absolutely delicious amazing soup as well to thumbs up hands-down"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Waited 25 mins for scrambled eggs. GM came over a couple of times to ask how everything was going & when we informed her that we've been waiting for a while on eggs, she apologized but said nothing else. One good thing I should mention though, is they let us bring home leftovers from our endless brunch."}
{"text":"Such a fun concept and atmosphere! Mexican / Asian food. Can't go wrong with any of the creative guac dips or the tacos. I also love the sushi! Definitely one of my go to spots. Can get a little noisy on the weekends as they have a DJ. Awesome weekend brunch too! Fun cocktails."}
{"text":"Holy food coma! SumoMaya is THE place to go for an upscale boozy weekend brunch. The brunch menu is $29 for unlimited appetizers and sides with one entree. For $10 extra you can order unlimited mimosas, bloody Mary's, or margaritas (each additional drink is a penny each - but who's counting).   Honestly, I was like a kid in a candy store. The dishes just kept coming! Everything we tried was absolutely delicious. Our favorites were the fluffy scrambled eggs, the sushi roll sampler, and the Chinese sausage fried rice   Definitely bookmark this as your next brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Honestly didn't love all the rolls but the pomegranate dried fruit guacamole was amazing, just amazing.  Really cool space.  Tried the tuna and the pork belly rolls, both good but not great.  A few other dishes were the same, except the Peruvian corn appetizer which was mushy.  Will go back for the guacamole.  Will probably find more I love here since Mexican and Japanese are basically my two favorite foods."}
{"text":"First let start start by saying there is a tree inside the restaurant!  This place is amazing to me.  If you decide to get a drink don't even look at the menu, ask for a gentleman named John.  He will ask what type of drinks you're into and then recommend his favorites.  He was fantastic!  There were quite a lot of people there but with great service comes lots of people so I suggest you make a reservation."}
{"text":"Great fusion Asian Mexican. The chapotle carnitas shrimp and crab rice is unreal. I'm a huge sushi guy, but their fusion dishes are so good. The Thai coconut soup fantastic. Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"The patio seating was very hip and the place is cool. Music is on trend but rather loud I thought. The food is tapas style and delicious. The sea bass, steak and corn were fantastic. We will be back."}
{"text":"We went during the end of happy hour...the bar was crowded and service was good.  Unfortunately, the appetizers fell short of what we expected.  The drinks were a little off too.  Maybe just a bad time but we hesitate returning.   It is on the pricy side so we expected above the curve."}
{"text":"I commend them for trying to bring something new to the table but they're trying too hard to be different that they forget the simple things like temperature of the food and attention to the customer. Fun for visitors though but as a local, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"This place is a little pricey but it's so good!   The atmosphere makes you feel a little fancy. There's clear chairs with random people's faces on them. I'm pretty sure one was my grandma. It's a little loud with a Dj, and full of beautiful people. You may want to dress up a smidge. Even this yoga pants devotee put on heels and a dress for this place. My friends took me here and it was lovely.   Now the food:  The street corn was topped with popcorn. It was unexpected but delicious. It added additional texture.   The chocolate peanut butter dessert was how I like my men: rich and sweet. It was almost like fudge. So if fudge and ice cream does not appeal to you, don't get it. It was smooth, sweet, and nutty. I'd definitely get it again, and I'd probably skip eating a big dinner so I could eat it myself.   The sushi rolls that I can't remember the names were good. It wasn't amazing, but it was good. Definitely better than the average sushi offerings for a desert.   The lobster ceviche was fantastic. It was topped with avocado, full of bright, fresh flavors. It was served with baked corn tortillas. If I get that again, I'm not sharing. I loved it.   Definitely come here."}
{"text":"Mexican-Asian Fusion? It should not be good, right? I mean, I avoided this place for months, despite the beckoning pink sign on Scottsdale Road, because Asian food is awesome and Mexican food is awesome, but I could not imagine them being awesome together. Wow, I was wrong!   My favorite thing to get at Sumo Maya is the Pomegranate Guacamole and the Maya Roll.   The Maya Roll has tuna, crispy rice, masago, micro shiso and wasabi aioli, and it's delicious. I love how the crispy rice on the outside gives the roll a nice crunch without being deep-fried, and the wasabi aioli is very, very yummy."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was amazing! The food is on the pricier side of $$, not it was delicious! The carne asada guacamole was my favorite thing that we ordered, but the al pastor was Pad Thai was great too. The sumo 75 cocktail was worth the $12!"}
{"text":"We came here for our anniversary dinner.  First and probably the last time.  It was really LOUD with club/techno music playing, very hard to hear what my hubby was saying.  Our waitress was just blah, didn't know the menu at all and seemed distracted.  The food was interesting/fine.  We spent too much money for the experience we had.  Too bad, wanted to love the place."}
{"text":"I loved this place but it may be because I love Asian Fusion places. I have to admit the only thing that we had that was fusion were the tacos. Otherwise it was straight up sushi which was good but a little overpriced for how uncreative it was. I want to try other dishes next time!   The server we had was excellent. She let us chill out in between ordering for each course, checked in just enough without bothering us too much, and constantly had our waters filled. The cocktails were excellent - I loved my frozen margarita.   Plus, the decor is great. It's a good mix of modern and southwestern prints and color without being too tacky or busy or cold. Price is on point for what you experience!"}
{"text":"My company hosted our holiday party here a couple weeks back. The food was great, but the service was lacking in a few key areas:   A) I'd been working with the event manager for three weeks and when I showed up the servers were offering people Sumo's full menu instead of the 'closed bar' choices on the pre-printed menus on the tables. This could have cost thousands.   B) Because Sumo does not offer centerpieces, one of our staff  members took the time to make them over the weekend, and dropped them off ahead of the event. They were intended for the party's attendees, (employees). Some of Sumo's employees took these centerpieces without asking, a couple took off with them. All this happened before the party was over.   C) After your company drops 4K on a party you kind of expect some exceptional or at least decent customer service right? Welp... not so much. The founder of the company took a few of the company's Bus Dev team members to the bar at Sumo (five feet away from our tables), and tried to order Fireball shots for them. The bartender retorted with a yippy \"we only serve drinks for grownups here\".  In general this place has a cool atmosphere and a fun,eclectic menu (all delish), but may be growing a little too quickly for its \"britches\". Not sure I'd host another event here, but definitely a fun spot to take a foodie friend or significant other who likes hip and doesn't mind a little yuppy."}
{"text":"Food was ehhhh. Service was horrible. We had a male server, whom we later found out was the boss/ manager, that was short and just plain unpleasant. We spend over $500 for just a table of four. He slammed everything on the table. Due to our small bar top table we were not able to order all at once. We order a couple of things at a time. His seemed upset each time we wanted to order additional items. Consistently gave us attitude and reached across from us to grab things.   I've never had someone who hated their job that much to the point where we weren't able to enjoy our meal. It made it so uncomfortable just to enjoy what was suppose to be a nice meal with a group of friends."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Went with a group of 19 and ordered many of the dishes off the menu. The Kimchi Fried Rice is a must, as well as the Wild Mushroom Tacos. On top of the delicious food, was the incredible ambience and beautiful decor, topped off nicely with a very friendly waitstaff. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Don't get the hype most of what I ordered was on the Mexican side of menu so not sure if there sushi is what there know for. First came for my bday and candeled another resv to go here. It was one of the fastest meals I've ever had very rushed seemed like stuff was pre made even tho I don't believe it was but still nothing flavorful at all. Would like to point out one highlight of the meal but there was one maybe the cocktail.  Service was okay but once again very very rushed."}
{"text":"I have been to sumomaya twice before and have really enjoyed the experience. I loved the food and they have my favorite drink in town. Tonight however for the first time I walked out of a restaurant. After no one, but the person who poured out water (his name was Seth and he was so nice!), came to our table for 15 minutes we left. The table right next to us was being waited on and despite being walked by at least 8 times total by 3 different people not one person acknowledged our table. Best part was on the way out the hostess who greeted us asked how the food was....because 15 minutes is the usual table turnover time. Really upset about this one and honestly unless they fix their wait staff problems I don't think I will comeback or recommend them :("}
{"text":"Fantastic and inventive menu and drink choices. Great place to share small plates and sushi. Korean beef tacos and traditional guacamole were phenomenal! Service was great. Fun atmosphere. Only complaint is the music was a bit too loud."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to SumoMaya on a weeknight (a Thursday maybe) and man oh man was it pretty fun! The atmosphere is soooo electric, sexy, cool, fly .... very DC to me. I've heard so much about this place and added it to my \"Places to Check Out\" list for a while. I'm so, so glad I finally have it a try.   I'm a bourbon and whiskey lover ....tequila, vodka and cognac drinker. We both ordered old fashions they were so good. For the second round however, I wanted something a little different but heavy. I don't like sweet drinks. The kind and very attentive bartender suggested a drink similar to the old fashioned but made with a really good tequila. It was PERFECT! I wish I could remember the name! We also shared an order of calamari and sushi... both delish!!   We've already made plans to check them out again this week! Perfect ladies night out or date night kind of place!"}
{"text":"I really cool and hip looking place in Scottsdale that attracts a lively after work crowd that piles in for happy hour.  There are some good offerings on the HH menu, but portions are quite small (korean tacos were teeny tiny) and the \"real crab\" California roll tasted rather odd.  For some reason, I expected the dishes to be a little more creative and geared towards the foodie crowd, but the Mexican Asian fusion wasn't bad, it just didn't offer anything unique or spectacular.  Cocktails are definitely their highlight with the Spicy Peach being the standout. So if you're wanting to hang out in a restaurant that has an energetic vibe, ready to spend a little more $$ for smaller portions and want to be a part of a happening social scene, this place is just for you."}
{"text":"When I heard there was an Asian/Mexican fusion restaurant I just had to try it. I went there last night with my husband and cousim to check it out. I made reservations on Opentable.com for 630p. A nice girl called me earlier in the day to confirm my reservation which I thought was very nice - for a Monday night reservation...I would highly reccomend making a reservation because it is a new restaurant in Scottsdale (also near Paradise Valley) which tends to draw a lot of dinner guests. It was packed last night and we left at 830pm. The restauant sits on Scottsdale Rd but you enter from the other side where there seems to be a moderate amount of parking. For some reason. Of course there are 'those' lamborginis and/or ferarris that just cant park in the normal parking spots but dont be fooled by those - its just scottsdale/paradise valley. The amibiance is great with bright colors a nice center bar and table seating both in and outdoors. We sat inside near the 2 huge TV's hanging over the bar. At first I thought the TVs were going to be distracting but actually they blended in even though you couldnt miss them.  We had a great waiter but didnt catch his name. He reccomended the guacamole with crab which was amazing. We also ordered the Tuna Tacos, rock shrimp, pork belly roll and chilean sea bass skewers. They were ALL awesome :) They offer very interesting items with a lot of great flavor combinations. I do think it is a little expensive. The skewers were $12 and you git six small pieces of fish - but on the bright side it was so tasty you forget about the price.  For dessert we ordered the Tres Leche Cake and OMG - to die for!!! There is a marshmallow crust on top that is lightly browned and a chocolate rice crispy treat to balance out the flavors. It really was one of the best desserts I have ever had.  I will definately return in the future. I did notice some snobby patrons but arent they everywhere? I have nothing bad to say about SumoMaya - great new restaurant and I am excited to plan another trip back."}
{"text":"Went there last Wednesday to celebrate a friends birthday, I love this place during the week lively and not too crowded.  Service 5+++ stars ! Our server I unfortunately do not remember his name, blonde hair neatly trimmed beard was probably the best server I have ever had in Scottsdale, one friend I was with said the last time she was there she had him as a server and he was great then too.  Decor? Modern comfortable and I always like a large indoor tree no matter where I am.  We started with the pomegranate guacamole (I love fruit and I love food, I don't like it mixed together) BUT it was easy to separate and delicious good fresh ingredients.  Rock shrimp tempura so good (sweeter than I remember) but still good.  My ONLY complaint is my entree Chaufa Rice, presentation is amazing served in a what resembled a molcajete with a base ( it looked like a stone martini glass) with a sunny side egg on top; However the rice was very salty and It probably had 4 small shrimp /3 small pieces of chorizo and maybe two or three small pieces of crab.  The service kept getting better and better we never wanted for anything even though our server had several other large tables he handled everything personally.  He brought out a cornucopia of small pieces of cake with salted Carmel ice cream and a sparkler for my friends birthday.  I am terrible with names  next time I come I want to make sure he is our server !"}
{"text":"Love it!  Kimchee fried rice, pomegranate guacamole, chicken mole, bacon wrapped dates, sumo-rita... all amazing!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was good and different, in a good way. It was a little pricey but it is a nice treat.  The inside was nicely decorated and very open, bright, and colorful. It had a nice brunch feel and can see it being a place to have dinner as well.  I came for brunch on Saturday and was seated pretty quickly. On Sat- Sun from 9AM to 2PM is bottomless brunch. If you want a la carte or individual dish you can sit at the bar or you can come at another time. The bottomless brunch was $29 and extra $10 for bottomless bloody marys, margs, mimosas, micheladas, and draft beer which is a little pricey. You get unlimited shared plates (apps), one entree, and unlimited desert.  The guac was good. I like the pomegranate and dried cranberries in it; It added a nice sweetness but not overpowering and different texture. The tostadas that came with it was seasoned with more than just salt and it was good. Part of the unlimited is an option for assorted sushi rolls. I ordered multiple sushi plates. The rolls had good chunks of salmon or tuna.   For entree I ordered the wagyu steak and eggs. This was interesting. The wagyu steak did not melt in my mouth like I would hope. It had a little bite but the crust on the outside was nice, well seasoned. The plate also had a poached egg on a crispy wonton. I did not feel like it went together with the steak but separately they were good. Next time I would explore other entrees. My friend had the pad thai which was good.  The desserts were delicious, especially when you order both desserts and you dip the brunuelos (cinnamon crisp) into the liquid cheesecake brulee."}
{"text":"So we came to SumoMaya for happy hour with a couple of friends that live in Arizona....we get to a table, order food & drinks...get our food and drinks...and THEN the manager comes and tells us that their is a dress code (phil has on a tank top & Jamealle has a sleeveless hoodie because it's hot as fuck out here) and we get asked to leave..cool, whatever..manager says he will comp what we ordered...then we ask for the owner because he was the one that ordered us to leave, he became rude and ORDERED us out...but not before telling us to pay for our total bill...sorry buddy...then he calls the cops on us and follows us outside....cops come, tell our story...and our friends end up paying for what they ordered before we got there. We win. But NEVER EVER will come to this terrible establishment again!! The we've asked around and the owner has a habit of being selectively racist & discriminate towards people of color."}
{"text":"Unique!  A Mexican Asian fusion with a big variety of dishes that have influences from both palates.  They also have a number of distinctive cocktails."}
{"text":"Shared the calamari, pork belly sushi, and green tea soba noodles with two other people.  Their calamari isn't the usual calamari. They drown it in a sauce so it's not like crunchy, but I did like the overall taste and would definitely recommend getting it. The pork belly sushi was alright. Pork belly isn't the most flavorful meat out there, so it did taste a little flat, but still good quality. The green tea soba noodles were my favorite! Definitely recommend. Had a nice light, fresh flavor and honestly could've just ate it myself LOL.  Came at a rather popular time and there was no wait!"}
{"text":"This has become a go to sushi place for my boyfriend and I. We loved not only the unique selection of dishes but our wonderful waitress, Dominique. She made our experience memorable.  The sushi combinations were fantastic and would have loved to tried them all but sadly our stomachs couldn't fit anymore. Our favorite plate was the pomegranate guacamole with the seasoned tostadas. Delicious! The menu seemed to have a little bit of everything. We can't wait till our next visit."}
{"text":"It's a shame I really wanted to like this place.   The good: Showed up  Friday night without a reservation, the host seated us rather quickly Server was great explained the menu in great detail.  The bad: While waiting for our appetizers German Osio (the owner) came by to introduce himself. He was slurring his words and seemed drunk. During our meal we noticed German get into an altercation with a guest that was sitting close by.  German followed the guy outside. My girl was curious to see what happened so she stepped outside. She saw German choke the guy and then saw the guy punch German in the face knocking him out cold! The police and ambulance showed up it was a huge scene. For this guy to own two other restaurants in the valley he is highly unprofessional. I've never witnessed such animalistic behavior before, especially in Scottsdale. All in all food was mediocre but it might just have been the owners behavior that ruined our experience. This place won't be open long if German keeps up this behavior, I will NOT be back."}
{"text":"Love the menu! Super creative fusion ideas pairing asian and mexican. Had the salmon ceviche, bacon wrapped dates and then spicy tuna tacos... Fantastic flavors! And the service was impeccable and helpful."}
{"text":"Service is slow. Super loud so hard to visit with friends.Took quite a while to get drinks out. Second entree came out 10 minutes after first entree.  Received second round of drinks after meal was completed. Value wise not much better. Twenty four bucks for a small crab noodle dish. The food was good but wouldn't recommend and wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Chic vibe, it was perfect for the bachelorette party dinner I was planning and would be great for other special events or a nice date night out. Food and drinks were incredible!"}
{"text":"From the outside this place doesn't look like anything special, but once you walk through the doors - holy cow what a fun environment! It has quite the \"clubby\" feel for a restaurant but it worked. Asian Mexican fusion food you say... what?? I was so confused how it would work, but my guacamole went surprisingly well with the pad thai and sushi rolls. Despite having a HUGE group (we were in town for SB49) our waitress was a GEM! She was so sweet and patient with all the orders, although some didn't make it out when we wanted, she took great care of us - I tasted quite a plethora of different dishes and they were all equally delicious. Any chance I'm back in this area, I'll definitely be back! Minus the terrible Pat's fans of course. ;)"}
{"text":"Great food.. better atmosphere!  Awesome service and EVERYONE is friendly.  Last night we had a table that they originally placed us that we did not really care for. We simply gave them the word and with no trouble at all they moved us to a more accommodating table.  And during the whole experience we must've dealt with three different people that were all friendly with smiles and did not make us feel bad or out of place for asking for it."}
{"text":"Overpriced for tapas style. Waiter could not really explain menu and menu was too complex for what you get. Waiter did inform us the menu has already been revised once since opening. Being open a month you would think they would have produce to make a salad. Three items we tried to order they could not make. You will be disappointed and still hungry if you only order one item on the menu. For two people expect to spend $90 plus. The concept sounds like a fun idea but so far Sumo Maya has poorly executed it. The music is obnoxiously loud and unnecessary. Oh and food comes from two kitchens so expect food to randomly appear at your table. The experience was like hanging at an old town bar except that is not the experience I want for dinner service. Parking is valet only and very limited so be ready to fork out a tip for the \"complimentary\" valet. Recommendation i s to not waste your time and money. Changes will need to occur before going back. For Asian just go to Tooties across the street."}
{"text":"Very unusual mix of Asian and Mexican, but it works! I really enjoyed the salmon-apple-jalape√±o roll! They have a \"Real\" California roll for $13 that contains real crabmeat. It was a small roll and not much flavor. I'd pass on it and go for something more interesting! Atmosphere was great and servers are very attentive and helpful making menu selections."}
{"text":"Glimmers of greatness, but screwed up in the execution. I read plenty of reviews about good food and bad service, and SumoMaya was true to their reputation.  We had 13 in our group, and the service was bad.  Food took a very long time to come out, with dishes trickling out for over an hour.  As we were ready to pay our bill they brought the last two tapas dishes. For the money they spent building this place, they should hire a strong operations team and get their act together. Food was good, but the wait was bad."}
{"text":"Came here for my 41st birthday while visiting Scottsdale for the Final Four, and the dinner may have been the highlight of the whole trip.   Our server, Nicole, gave us some great recommendations and also provided us with perfect advice on the items that we had selected.   The Red Dragon Roll, Korean Beef Tacos, and Sizzling Chaufa Rice were amazing.  I'm not sure I've had a dish with as many flavors as the Chaufa.  It was like there was a party in my mouth and everyone was invited."}
{"text":"Swanky. Cool. Fun. Yum !  Great drinks too! Happy hour is the best in town! It's a chance to try the unique menu !  Not to mention their  fabulous brunch !  Great indoor outdoor architecture. The best date night location!"}
{"text":"Came here the first time a while ago and thought it was good and service was great but didn't have a crazy need to come back. Decided to pop in again for lunch and walked away thinking the sushi was exceptional! Fish was fresh and the combination of flavors unique. Service again was on point."}
{"text":"Best ambiance ever and our server was BY FAR the best I've ever had. Jennifer Siegel. I will come back for the sushi and her."}
{"text":"If you're looking for over priced, small portions of food, with a fly problem and terrible service, this is the place for you! We dined here , post lunch, for a family members birthday with a large group. The server was rude, but expected when dining in Scottsdale. After taking our order 20 minutes prior, he came to inform the birthday girl and her husband that the dishes they had chosen were unavailable, so everyone else's food come out way before theirs. We asked for minor things numerous times and it took an unusually long amount of time to get them. The food was actually really good, so good that the multiple flies in the place couldn't help but want some too. Our dirty appetizer plates remained on the table for the entire meal and good luck getting a refill on water! For a place with pricey food, one would think they could put the effort in to provide better service...."}
{"text":"Ambiance is awesome! Loud music and a nice crowd; however the food is OK, and so is the service."}
{"text":"Where do I start.  The ambience and decor alone are an enough reason to check it out but the food is INCREDIBLE!!  I had the best Taco (Korean BBQ) and best sushi I've ever had in one meal.    The sushi is nothing short of amazing.  We sat on the patio and it was very family friendly for kids.  Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Our bachelorette party went here for our big dinner out. We all left so stuffed and happy. I wish I remembered our server's name because she was the nicest woman, even when the 11 of us were being a little  obnoxious. The tapas style food was perfect for our large group, and everything that got passed around was better than the last."}
{"text":"Was recommended here by a local as I was traveling on business. Very cool place inside. The sushi quality was amazing although the rice fell apart. Very good variety."}
{"text":"Stopped into this spot for a quick lunch with the fam today and was not disappointed! Had a rough time deciding what to order since everything on the menu looks amazing but we settled on trying the pomegranate guacamole, al pastor pad Thai, Korean beef tacos and the rollo chingon. Portions were very generous and the flavors were in point! Service was exceptional, prompt, warm and friendly. Definitely recommend a visit if you're in the area! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fusion sushi place! 5-star for the vibe, the cocktail and decoration! Their birthday celebration was a fire cracker! The food was good but don't expect authentic Japanese.   We ordered unagi fois gra roll, Kimchi friend rice, ceviche, and some other sides! The pineapple drink I got was amazing. The rolls are creamy and nicely seasoned. Ceviche was a okay , just like anything outthere. The kimchi fried rice was to die for - spicy but you can't stop eating!   Great music, friendly stuff, I only wish the food and service can be a tad faster!"}
{"text":"Killer atmosphere and service, great cocktails, and the food was absolutely delicious. It's more upscale than I expected, but in a good way. I realized I was underdressed as soon as I walked in, but no one seemed to mind. Definitely make reservations if you want to go during any kind of peak time. I will absolutely go back and bring friends with me."}
{"text":"Great menu and food - only go if you have time and plan on sharing all your food. They use the excuse of two different kitchens for Asian and Mexican food as to why all the food comes out at separate times. If you wait till everyone gets their plates, you'll be sitting there for 45 mins."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time today! Went with a couple friends and I honestly had no idea it was a new spot till the waiter told me. Well let's start off with the fact that we got there at 4ish so dinner was not yet ready (starts at 5) and we had to sit either by the bar or high top tables. I was a bit bothered by that since it was 3 of us and we were starving. I did not want to share a tiny small table, but we did anyways!   Since the whole dinner thing and not being able to sit at a regular table did bother us at first. We just decided to only have an appetizer/drink and head on to another place but those minutes flew by and the appetizers came out so quick, we were very surprised. I ordered chicken tacos and even though they are super tiny they were AMAZING! Also the calamari was so flavorful. I asked the waitress to surprise me with a drink and she brought out a coconut beverage that was so good and had just the right amount of alcohol in it. We ended up waiting till 5 to move to a bigger table for dinner. No joke we ordered about 10 different plates and they were all wonderful! I had a second drink which was a coconut/pineapple margarita. The waiter did not mention it was frozen which I did not like but either way it was STRONG! (Very well worth your money if I may say so). Overall, service was great and so was everything else. The place is definitely very hip and modern!"}
{"text":"Came here in the month of May and didn't see a single sumo wrestler, food and service was fine but I was expecting a large Asian battle royale in diapers"}
{"text":"What a delightful and delicious experience!  We are from Oregon and here on a short vacation and this place was recommended to us.   The tacos are wonderful. We had the Mahdi Mahdi, the Korean beef and the pork tacos and loved each one of them."}
{"text":"SumoMaya's second attempt at satisfaction was successful. Speedy delivery of meals and a friendly waitress gave this restaurant a new face for my eyes. I enjoyed everything I ate. We tried the ceviche Del dia which was delicious chipotle sea bass. The bacon guac is a must. We ate the spongy chocolate cake. The only thing I would change is the bussing of the tables. I also didn't like that my chair was on a secondary piece of wood that went around the tree. Every time someone walked past me, I felt my chair would tip over. But, when the tables are small and you're having tapas, there should be no empty/dirty plates on your table. All in all, I would return to SumoMaya"}
{"text":"Tacos and crab noodles were amazing! Interestimg flavors mesh together well! Definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"We ordered several dishes for take out on NYE and all of them were amazing-  ginger fried rice,  all the tacos,  coconut soup,  tuna rolls...Brilliant pairing of food.  We need this in Los Angeles."}
{"text":"Sumo Maya is a spectacular fusion of Asian & Mexican cuisine!   Highlights: -The chicken wings have an amazing sauce, but are a tad spicy! -The sushi rolls are very unique, with flavors unlike your typical sushi roll. Highly recommended! -The tacos are perfect for sharing.   Overall there are so many options on the menu, we will need to go back to keep exploring."}
{"text":"Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.  Food was delicious  Service was Stella.   Deserves every single star  Amazing.   Will definitely be dining with them again soon  Server was Victoria - amazing !!!!!"}
{"text":"Since this place opened, I had been wanting to check it out.  I finally had lunch there this past weekend and I was very underwhelmed.  First, their website should state somewhere that the Lunch menu is not available on the weekends, we were disappointed when our only choice was the Brunch menu, which is a lot more limited.  The service was not good, server was not very attentive and pretty flighty, although the expediting staff that brought out our food from the kitchen was great and pleasant.  My brother has a big aversion to avocado, so he had ordered his sandwich without it, but it arrived with avocado in it anyway.  After flagging down a server, he sent it back and we were surprised when it came back within a minute, only to realize that the kitchen just scraped it off and sent it back to the table (there was green all over the bread. The restaurant is lucky there were no allergies.    The rest of our food was just OK, although the Shishito peppers were definitely the best part, and I will concede that the restaurant did let us order those from the lunch menu.  All in all, a disappointing experience for something i was really looking forward to, and despite the OK food, the service was bad enough that I wouldn't pick this place as somewhere I'd go back to."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch today, and the decor is really nice, large, open, airy, and modern.  Of course the weather was really good, and they had all the glass walls open to the patios.  Having lived in Japan for a year, I am a sushi purist, but the Mexican-Japanese fusion is well paired.  I only tried one item...The rock shrimp tuna roll.  It was good!  I will definitely be going back to try more items."}
{"text":"The drinks were fantastic. Blood orange margarita yum. Sushi was incredible.  Very creative. The atmosphere was hip and fun. Service was very good sat in the bar."}
{"text":"no matter the day nor the time i enjoy coming here, the food is always very good, managers are great and for the most part the staff all have it together, i went thursday  about 9 o'clock  with a girlfriend she ordered sushi,and edemame, i ordered the street corn and the kimichi fried rice and everything was fantastic  reverse hh late night and happy hour during the day you can not bet the groove of the place, always busy and quite liveley, service good, food and drinks fantastic ambience great!  i will defenitly come back more great place to people watch and even a great girls night out or guys night out spot! A+"}
{"text":"Sumomaya has an identity crisis.    * Do you want to be a creative, chef-driven restaurant with unique and very flavorful dishes?   * Do you want to be a night club / meat market with god-awfully-loud thumping bass beats and electronica drowning out any hope for conversation with your table mates?  * Do you want to be a place known for aloof, apparently drugged-out wait staff who show almost next to no knowledge of your menu and even less interest in their customers?  If they would just turn their focus squarely on saying YES to the first question and a hearty NO to the next two questions, this could be a great restaurant.  We were there for dinner and tried a mixture of dishes: starting from the bacon-laced guacamole through to the pork pad thai, the food was flavored just right and unlike anything I've tried at either an \"mexican\" or \"asian\" restaurant.  The kitchen really delivered on the brand promise / vision for this restaurant.  On the strictly food scale, this place rocks a 5.  It's just too bad that, aside from the stunning decor and great physical environment, they have chosen to ruin the atmosphere with Miami Beach club music overpowering the entire scene and with a waitstaff that would probably not make the grade at your local McDonalds.  We won't be returning any time soon as these two elements really turned a great food experience into a sour dining experience."}
{"text":"5 of my friends and I decided to have brunch here Sunday, after reading a New Times review that was pretty positive. Apparently the New Times didn't go for brunch. We arrived early-9am, as we were cycling over and wanted to avoid the heat. We sat outside on the patio, which was nice, aside from the vinyl cushions. Why anyone would use vinyl cushions outside in Arizona is beyond me. Our server, Jorge, seemed nice, although his accent was a bit of a challenge. That mostly just resulted in my asking him to repeat himself, and feeling like an ass.  When he took our order, it was very disorganized. There were only 6 of us, and he asked me three times what I wanted to drink. It took 15 minutes to get our drinks - 3 Bloody Mary's and 3 mimosas. It seemed a little excessive. After bringing us our drinks and waiting another 15 minutes, he finally took our food order. I was only asked for my entree twice, which was a slight improvement over my drink order, but 3 of us were asked multiple times, which seemed odd. Our drinks were empty by that point and we requested refills. We did, after all, order unlimited drinks. That took about 10 minutes. We couldn't figure out why, we were the only people there, aside from other employees. We ordered bacon guacamole and crab guacamole to start with, and we received 6 chips for 6 people. Now they were big, but really?! The guacamole was tasty but the consistency was AWFUL. It was not creamy at all, it felt like a bunch of diced avocado and spices. I wish I'd taken a photo. Our entrees arrived about 15 minutes after the guacamole, which was fine, but my food wasn't hot, or even warm. Lukewarm, maybe. It was still decent, but if it had been hot I think it would have been wonderful. The eggs were poached perfectly, which was impressive, given how often they are overdone. After our food was delivered, we waited maybe 20 minutes for another drink refill. We also had been without water most if the time, I think I asked three times. Why he didn't leave a pitcher, I don't understand. After our plates had been cleared, the check was promptly delivered. We requested separate checks, and he said the best he could do was split it evenly between the 6 of us. At this point we were so annoyed we said fine. We planned on staying and relaxing a bit with a few drinks, but when we asked for more, he said \"oh, I don't think I can do that since I closed the check\". Somehow he made it work, but wow what a thing for a server to say. We never had asked for the check! The most disappointing part of the meal was the outright passive aggressiveness Jorge displayed after one of our group wrote up a quick Yelp review at the table. She asked for something, and he said, very bitterly, \"Of course, Kristina\". She was the only person who paid with cash, so we immediately knew how he knew her name (again, only people in the restaurant). We were all pretty appalled at that. The manager stopped by to let us know he saw the review, and he was quite nice, but it didn't really make up for the terrible service. As much as this place has great potential (the food could have been amazing, if only it was hot), the service ruined my experience and I probably won't return."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced and just not good.  My husband and I have wide and discerning palates.  We ordered the signature guacamole, sushi, and homemade ramen noodles.  The sushi was very good although not super cold.  The crab in the guacamole was a terrible pairing and the chips served with tasteless.  The homemade ramen noodles were greasy, overly spiced and without any texture like crisp vegetables to balance out the greasy blob of noodles.   By all means go to SumoMaya IF you're planning on having sushi and drinks.  Otherwise, find a restaurant that deserves your entr√©e dollars."}
{"text":"This place was so good! I was at the salon next door and they suggested I grab dinner here. I'm so glad I did...the environment is super cute and the Mexican/Asian fusion was right up my alley!"}
{"text":"Been here for lunches and a couple dinners in the past, so it is time to Yelp.  Went for a quick lunch. Sat at the bar. Had an all appetizer lunch. Salmon street tacos were delicious with a hint of spice. The ginger rice with grilled shrimp was also a hit. We also ordered a side of sweet white corn...sooo tasty.  The bar was slow and the service was quick and extremely friendly.  All of our meals there have been very imaginative in composition which adds to the excitement of the vibe there"}
{"text":"I actually emailed the General Manager the following:  ===================== Hi Jason,  I hope this finds you well...  We just want to thank you for the hospitality and beautiful time we had for my wife's birthday last weekend.  Your staff was very courteous, fast, and always had a smile on their faces.  Please let them know how much we appreciated their services.  Thank you Jason for being attentive to us even though we were pushed back a little, we totally understand and your graciousness was very professional and accommodating.  We definitely will be going to Sumo Maya frequently, and we hope to see you on a regular basis.  Thanks again!"}
{"text":"This is the new hot spot in Scottsdale and not only does it look good, but the food is excellent. Now combining Latin America cuisine with Asian food may sound a little odd at first, but trust me, this place is great!  We went here the other day for our office Christmas lunch and had a great time. There were six of us and between us we tried the following items: guacamole with pomegranate, street tacos, Chinese-style chili crab garlic noodles, Mexican pho, Mexican street corn, the steak pepito sandwich, and the lobster and crab \"dynamite\".   Everyone enjoyed their food immensely and the service was great, with the waiter answering all our questions and doing an excellent job of adjusting the heaters and the wind shades so that everyone was comfortable. For dessert, we decided to split three items, the tres leche cake, chocolate peanut butter bar, and the chocolate sticky cake.  My only regret is that there were so many other items on the menu that I wanted to try and no one else wanted to order the ceviche, but I guess that just means I have an excuse to go back... and I definitely plan to do that. In fact, I may need to make several visits to get my fill of this place :-)"}
{"text":"SumoMaya is an EXCELLENT choice for Happy Hour.  My friend and I spent $9 total on 4 incredibly tasty tacos and some edamame.  YUM. Not too many places have Happy Hour DAILY ... SumoMaya does, and has great service, too!  I don't think you can beat the Happy Hour food options here.  Great taste for a great price.  The drinks aren't nearly as affordable, and outside of Happy Hour, food prices jump up quite a bit, but if you're just looking to enjoy a nice snack and some good conversation, SumoMaya is a terrific choice.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and unique. Loved their spin on Mexican and Asian food but their service was terrible. Our waiter up sold us on drinks without even asking. The busser was more help than the waiter when it came to the waiter."}
{"text":"Great place to come for tapas and drinks. Modern vibe and great menu selection. All of the tacos we had were good and the sushi was pretty good too. I would recommend coming here during happy hour because they have a great happy hour menu. The best thing I had was the crunchy tuna tacos. The atmosphere is very trendy and the service was great."}
{"text":"the decor is great, food sucks! service isn't good either, the service is better at the bar. I really wish it was better because the location is so great. most of the food is super salty and not edible."}
{"text":"This food is absolutely amazing!! You MUST order the pomegranate guacamole and Korean beef tacos!! It is pretty rare that I am so pleasantly surprised by food. I also had the carne asada meal and it was also incredible. Delicious!! The atmosphere is fun and lively. We will absolutely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Super service! Very eclectic menu selection. Something for all desires. Staff is super knowledgeable, friendly and accommodating! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I love this place. High end Asian/Latin fusion. When you walk in, they have awesome decor, with a giant picture of a sumo wrestler next to Zapata.  Their Maya rolls are great and flavorful. We made a reservation through Open Table so no wait. We were a bit early so grabbed some drinks at the bar which were also delicious. The fried rice dish was great as were the Korean tacos. Would gladly come back here any day of the week."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale hands down. It has EVERYTHING- amazing food, the trendiest of decors and ambiance and good service. We often come here for dinner and have their fresh guac/miso salmon/kimchee rice and ceviche!!! Their toffee cake is also off the charts...and we find ourselves here for dessert after a meal elsewhere. Definitely always hip and happening with continuous amazing music by the in house DJ.....service can be slow at times, so just be wary of that. Otherwise a perfect place to impress your out of town guests and give them a true taste of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The two of us ate there on a Thursday afternoon during their \"social hour\", having mostly the social hour food....street tacos, especially.  All street tacos we tried were very good, and the wild mushroom taco (without avocado, or with it on the side) might be the best street taco we have had in years.  Highly recommend.....and the prices are great during their social hour.  Try sitting by the kitchen bar, so you can see how things are made."}
{"text":"Excellent! The bacon dates in fois gras were amazing! Everything was perfectly balanced. The sumo salad, ramen, mushroom and Korean beef tacos were also great. I wouldn't recommend the tempura cod taco, it kind of fell flat with too much mayo. The decor is fun and fresh, and the overall flavored unique and exciting."}
{"text":"This place is way trendy. It's got everything a new, trendy Scottsdale spot should have. Weird fusion food, an eclectic yet tasteful interior decorating job, wooden chairs (the ones that look like they could have come out of someone's old barn, but really they cost $500 each from Restoration Hardware), mismatched, waitresses who look like they could work nights at El Hefe in their booty shorts, and an open floor-plan concept. It's got it all.  If you don't know what Mexican-Asian fusion food is, don't worry. No one else does either. But it's dang tasty! I like that SumoMaya sounds like it would be way too off-the-grid type of food to be enjoyable, but they actually do a good job of separating their menu into a Mexican category and an Asian category so people don't get too freaked out. I ended up having the Duck Breast, something I thought I'd be going out on a limb ordering, but it was amaaaaaazing. Very tender, full of flavor, and I would happily order it again.  I didn't have any cocktails, but my friends had plenty of them since we were there for a birthday, and everyone had great things to say about their drinks. I tried one of them, the Passionfruit, and it was to die for. It's similar to a margarita, but they mix in some ginger beer for a little zing and a little fizz, and you should definitely order it.  All in all, great experience. The service was pretty slow. I was the last to get my drink, and all I got was a red wine, and the last to get my food (but it was duck breast so I'm cool wit that). Otherwise, it was great, and our server was very nice."}
{"text":"A page out of the scottsdale chic. Quirky hipster spot with a very diverse menu. We attend their brunch on a early Sunday afternoon. The place is a great spectacle and the food is ironically amazing. However the service was really the biggest quirky part of the place. Our wait staff was pleasant but honestly had no clue what was going on. No one seemed to know the menu or what came with what... Although in the middle of knowing nothing all of the sudden there were little glimpses of brilliance on the part of the staff. I've got it... The staff is a paradox. Honestly the food and the place saved the experience. The staff kinda made my head spin."}
{"text":"Love the variety! Love the sushi and the strawberry soup! Shishito peppers are fabulous and by far THE best guacamole I've ever had from a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food and service were mostly good. Our table shared the traditional guacamole, sesame chicken tacos, ahi tuna tacos and soft shell crab roll. The music was RIDICULOUSLY, annoyingly loud on a Tuesday night. There were only 3 of us at a small table and we had to yell to talk to each other. Like trying to talk in a night club. Great for dancing, terrible for dinner conversation. Cocktails were weak, flat and watered down. Decor is fun, menu is interesting but the flaws made it a subpar experience. Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my breakfast which was the crab and avocado omelet. I'm leaving with a bad taste in my mouth. After my fianc√© asked if it was cheaper to order mimosas individually if she was only going to have two versus the bottomless mimosas for $15, I was charged $18 for two. When I asked the waiter if he could change it to the $15 price (since bottomless was only $15 and two was supposed to be cheaper than that) he replied that this was how his manager told him to charge me. So if you are having thoughts on having two mimosas, that is more than bottomless!"}
{"text":"The way that I found out about SumoMaya is because I live in the same Luxe condo complex as the chef, Herb Wilson. We met a couple of times around our grounds and have had conversations in which he had shared with me about his new restaurant in north Scottsdale and extended an invitation to visit. I took him up on it last Friday and I have to say that I am very impressed! The atmosphere, the music, the design and decor, the service and the food were all excellent! I am typically not into fusion type restaurants, however, in this case, because it's only working with and fusing 2 amazing types of cuisine flavors - it works! I highly  recommend that you visit, experience and enjoy the establishment of SumoMaya. You will absolutely be happy that you did and want to return again and again!  Enjoy and cheers!"}
{"text":"The cynic in me rolled my eyes at the Japanese/Mexican mash-up theme. Cultural mash-ups easily slide into really bad restaurants who try to force gimmicks too hard at the sacrifice of good food or tact. I was envisioning refried bean sushi and raw fish tacos served by sombrero-wearing ninjas.   Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is not a mash-up, but more of a conjoining of two of my favorite cuisines in the same restaurant. Good Japanese and good Mexican food. Sure, there is some fusion between the two - but they were gentle and in dishes that made sense.   And the dishes were beyond good. They were great. Delicious. Perfectly prepared. Impeccably plated. This makes this place a perfect date restaurant. It is no wonder the place was packed with misty eyed couples + packs of tight-panted dudes/dudettes scoping out the meats on display.   Special mention to the Cochinita Pibil, guac, ceviche, and sushi. However, one might pass on the calamari, which was the weak dish in that it was merely ok because it was too salty/oily.   Be sure to make reservations and ask for one of the tables that are at the threshold of indoor/outdoors, which are cool enough to sit \"outdoors\" but far enough away from the large/distracting television screens."}
{"text":"A great experience!  Food and atmosphere was fantastic and out waitress, Brittany, was outstanding!!"}
{"text":"New favorite! I've been here for brunch, dinner, and happy hour. I'm a huge fan of their set pricing for brunch + extra cost for bottomless drinks. The food is fantastic and unique and the place has a really cool vibe. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Took some out of townees their on a Saturday early evening.  The place was packed.  Great vibe.  They loved the Japanese Mexican combo.  They had and love the Sushi, I had rice with chicken that had an egg on top.  Passed in on Scottsdale for years without paying much attention.  Was very surprised by it upon entering.  Do yourself a favor and try it."}
{"text":"So Hubby and I decided to swing in to Sumo after a theater matinee to check out the Happy Hour. Were really glad we went the cheap-o route -- spending less on drinks and appetizers than we normally spend on wine, alone, at other places! -- because it was really hit-and-miss.   Free valet parking is a nice touch before you even walk in.    All the high-tops were taken, so we sat at the bar and encountered really disappointing service. Seemed the bartender was overwhelmed, both with the territory she had to cover and hiccups coming from the kitchen, so she wasn't the most welcoming sort.  Roasted pineapple marg and passion fruit sangria were nice. We tried three different types of tacos, all of which were good. The spicy tuna roll we had was, well, a spicy tuna roll...I was expecting something inventive, and didn't get it. The chicken chicharones were terrible -- basically just pieces of dry, unseasoned chicken breast rolled in corn meal and fried. The sauce they came with wasn't enough to overcome the dish's other shortcomings.  The place is clearly a magnet for 20-something tourists and Botox addicts, which though slightly weird is also mildly entertaining. I suppose we might come back for the cheap eats, but...probably not."}
{"text":"Always an awesome vibe no matter the day of the week. Their fusion of Mexican and Asian is perfect. Every dish is flavorful. We usually go for the Korean beef tacos, kimchi fried rice and Chinese garlic noodles. They need a chef's choice tasting menu in the future.  Definitely at the level of NYC and LA dishes."}
{"text":"I was driving down the rd to another restaurant and saw this place. Great location, reminds me of China Poblano in Vegas. Great happy hour menu. Special thanks to Erica! Defintely coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open because I love Asian and Mexican food. Two of my favorites! They have big TVs for sports but not too many in case your looking for a more intimate atmosphere. Great drink selection and killer atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago with a bunch of gals for their weekend brunch! The food was excellent, service was top notch, and my bottomless mimosa was never empty!  Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The menu is creative but the flavors just don't blend all that well. The guac was terrific but everything else we ordered, which was a bunch because every order is so small, was mediocre at best. In addition to the small portion sizes, the prices for those small sizes are rather high. Finally, the atmosphere was not appealing... too loud with music pumping throughout the evening. For a place that seems to consider itself to be \"fine dining,\" having constant and loud music was disconcerting. Was looking forward to trying this place for a long time, but now I'm in absolutely no hurry to return."}
{"text":"I don't know a lot about Asian food, but my visit to SumoMaya made me realize how much I need to learn!   I started with the Rocky Shrimp Tempura, and was astounded by the eclectic flavors swimming around in my mouth. The pomegranate guacamole only added to this deliciousness! Then, I had the miso soup, which was a little salty, but who isn't a little salty these days?! And I miss the ocean, so it worked perfectly.   My entree was the miso sea bass, which I adored. Came with great sauce! I also ordered a side of Peruvian corn, which I would not suggest. (A little too much salt can kill all of the fish in the ocean if you know what I mean.)   For dessert, I had the chocolate sticky cake. Delicious! And my friend Bartholomew (visiting town from the Pacific) had a white Mexican cake that brought him back to his roots.  The atmosphere was pleasant and agreeable, with a funny and attentive waiter, good music, and a football game on in the background. Every plate arrived decked out with leaves or flowers, which only added to the appeal. Additionally, our waiter brought us fish tacos as a special treat because the chef made extra! How lovely!   Tl; dr: I want to eat ALL OF IT!! And you should too!"}
{"text":"Yum!  Really fun atmosphere.  Great cocktails and amazing guac.  Don't let the Asian/Mexican thing stop you, yes it's weird but it totally works."}
{"text":"OMG, amazing atmosphere, food and drinks!  This place was recommended to me from the shuttle driver at the Doubletree Hotel.  If you're in town you have to try this place, it's only a mile from the hotel.  My server Jessica was amazing!"}
{"text":"My wife LOVES this place. Easy birthday selection and might even slip in one or two other visits. The guacamole (any style) is great and their homemade tortilla chips go well. Good selection of unique sushi items."}
{"text":"I normally love this place! But last night 7/29/17 we had probably the worst experience. We sat at the bar for 10 minutes at least not even being acknowledged. Not even a hi. After getting up going back to the hostess stand we were seated with a great server, and EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS BUSY, she said I will be right with you. Just letting us know we were at least seen was enough. Then our drinks came out after our food, which clearly was not good. Not to mention our drinks tasted horrible! We like this place but had HORRIBLE service. Not what we expect from Sumo maya."}
{"text":"First visit here. We went to celebrate my friends bday. Let's celebrate the Softshell crab BLT. Omg that was a life changer!!!   I can't wait to try the sushi next time it looked just as good..."}
{"text":"Nothing about this place would make me return. It's much too loud. They wait staff is spread too thin. They practically run everywhere so of course they make mistakes. The food is average for the area at best."}
{"text":"Omg. What a fantastic place. Great ambience and decor. I loved the Chilean sea bass and shaking beef. Delicious food. Must try if you and in the area."}
{"text":"Sumomaya is a large, trendy restaurant featuring fusion of Mexican-inspired cuisine with Asian (primarily Korean, Thai, and Japanese) influences.  We came here for lunch, but I can see how this place would be excellent for happy hour or a casual dinner.  The menu has a broad range of dishes, ranging from $4 to $140 (24-oz Tomahawk steak and jumbo half lobster). Plenty of bar seating and large TVs, so it can function as a sports bar too.  Overall, I think the flavors worked for me.  I saw folks around me ordering sushi rolls, but we mainly stuck to the hot entrees:  Pork Belly Ramen was excellent.  Super tender and flavorful pork belly, plenty of chewy noodles, and a lighter, miso-like broth that's drinkable.  It came with a soft-poached egg too. (5 stars)  The Chaufa Rice reminds me a bit like hot stone bibimbap, but with baby shrimp and spanish chorizo mixed in with rice and chipotle hoisin sauce.  The menu claimed it had crab and carnitas but I can only taste the latter.  Pretty good dish as the flavors worked, but its slightly on the sweet side. (4 stars).  Mexican Street Corn was a bowl of grilled, spicy corn kernels with some spicy mayo, cotija, and lime.  It was topped with some popcorn as a bonus. (4 stars)  Caramelized Plantains were excellent - plump, crispy outside and soft inside and really hot.  The sherry vinaigrette sauce paired well.  This side dish can be a healthy dessert (5 stars).  A solid  4.5 star bumping up to 5 stars for the fun environment and great service."}
{"text":"There were some major hits and misses with SumoMaya. If you're going to eat here, it's really important to know what to order so that you don't end up with any disappointments. My husband and I both studied the yelp reviews and our instagram feeds to help guide us, but we still ended up with some stinkers.  What was excellent: 3 of our 4 cocktails! My husband's drink combined tamarind and rye, sort of like a manhattan. I got the green magic mojito, and the combo of coconut and mint was divine. I especially loved the whipped coconut cream on top. My second cocktail was their take on Pegu Club's amazing pisco punch. The SumoMaya version was crazy good too. For food, we loved the buttery, soft eggplant dish. Even if you think you hate eggplant, you may very well like this. Good portion for the price too. My husband said his yellowtail roll was far better than any he's had in AZ. The fish was fresh and not mushy like other places.  What was pretty good: The guacamole with togarashi was a great, albeit very expensive, starter. I might start sprinkling togarashi on my guac at home now. My husband liked salmon ceviche a lot but was yearning for kumquats in every bite. With that little tweak, it would have been excellent. Cocktail number 4, the passionfruit drink with mezcal, was decent but didn't come close to the yumminess of the others.  The misses: the summer corn. So bland. I don't know why I keep ordering this type of dish because I can make awesome Mexican corn at home. I guess I keep waiting to get surprised. The sumo green roll needed a lot of help from soy and wasabi. My husband thought it was awful. His hamachi ceviche was a let down too. Just one dimensional, not much too it.  Would we come here again? Maybe with a good set of ear plugs. The restaurant was nightclub in Vegas loud at 8pm on a Thursday night. It's just too much techno to be enjoyable."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect this time. The food, the service, really hit the mark. Kim Chee fried rice out of this world good."}
{"text":"The food is very good, portions are a bit small. We liked everything we ordered. Specially the Shaking Beef is a must try, the beef tacos were great, also the rock shrimp tempura.  The atmosphere is great, good mixture of the Sumo and the Maya. Music was not too loud, which was great. Over all great experience and definitely going back to try more."}
{"text":"Yuck, this place was so hyped up. I thought the food was horrible and over priced. The ambiance was good and drinks were fine. But I would never go back to eat."}
{"text":"If your going to order tacos, go here during Happy Hour. At HH, you get three for $7, but at all other times it is about $12-$14. Of course, we were there for lunch and out of the three tacos ordered, the cod seemed to score highest, while the tough beef should be avoided. My dish was the $14 Chinese Chicken salad and it was tasty, but didn't blow me away for the price. It had plenty of chicken and was presented nicely, but just didn't warrant the lofty lunch price tag enough. The dressing was tasty too and the TV sets are big here and the decor is unique, so there is hope for watching a game here during happy hour."}
{"text":"This was hands down, one of the coolest/unique restaurants I have ever been too!!!! I've never seen a menu like this before.  The drinks were amazing too!!!! My favorite was the shishito pepper, and the beef tacos!  Our service was A+!!!! Our waiter was Nick, and he was incredible.  The chef, who also used to run Sushi Roku in my old neighborhood.  He came over and said hello to us!!!!! Love this spot!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family after they had heard great things about it.  I wasn't impressed...nor were they.  Sorry for not having more detail...place was pretty forgettable...average food, service, experience"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a spot to try during Restaurant Week this is the place!  The sumo rolls were delicious! The eggplant dish was outstanding and the shaking beef was superb! Between the three of us we shared 6 small plates and 3 entrees. Oh and the Pad Thai was sooooo good! The flavor combinations were an explosion in the mouth.  As others have said, the ambiance is inviting, hip, and laid back.  There was some interesting people watching too. Scottsdale debutants galore."}
{"text":"Literally great experience our waiter josh was everything we needed. Great time fast service he's the best if you come to SumoMaya get josh he's the best!"}
{"text":"One of the best culinary experiences I've had. Went for dinner the night before and returned for their bottomless brunch. Great food and sushi. This is coming from a Vancouver BC sushi snob."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now and I couldn't be happier! The food was absolutely amazing and my server Nicole was great! The vibe is super fun! I absolutely recommend this place! The Ahi Tuna Tostada appetizer is my favorite! I like that it caters to sushi eaters and Mexican food eaters. I will come back again!"}
{"text":"This place is super cool. The decor is perfect, the bar is very comfortable, and the open air walls make the whole place a giant patio. I'm just having a cocktail today, but will be back immediately for lunch or dinner. Can't wait and will be sure to update when I do. The food looks and smells amazing, but I just ate a huge breakfast."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and very loud energetic music on Friday eve. Food was not impressive in taste. Looks good. We had the Giant shrimp, lobster/crab, asparagus and corn. May be back for drinks but not food."}
{"text":"The food was great! I attached photos from tonight's meal. The raw fish was clean and fresh as were the ingredients paired with it. I had the frozen mango marg, my wife enjoyed a nice glass of Rose. We had the maya roll, hamachi roll,  chicken tacos, crab with ramen, and the filet. Suma Maya has a Tapas style flare to it. The presentation, flavor, and delivery of the food were spectacular. The ambience was enjoyable. They have a giant faux tree in the middle of the restaurant. They did a great creating the Asian/Mexican fusion and knocked the quality of food out of the ballpark!! To top it off the valet was complimentary. We did not try any desserts. The restaurant is still new and they are working out the kinks on the service side. We will go again!"}
{"text":"Great fusion of Asian and Latin American influences. Only tried the happy hour menu, however was pleasantly surprised at how carefully plated each dish was, as well as the care put into the flavors of each serving. Salmon rolls were delicious, so too the Korean skirt steak tacos. Fun, colorful, inviting decor added to a great experience. Well worth the visit."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant! I'm so sad that I'm only in town for the week. We had a bit of everything, but the Miso glazed Chilean sea bass, the Suzuki roll, and the tres leches cake were our favorites. Great ambiance and the service was fantastic and the food came out very fast."}
{"text":"Haven't even ordered but WOW! I already received amazing service. They didn't have seats inside so they offered the patio tables with fans and misters which turned out to be to warm so as we were about to leave, the manager rushed up to us and told us he has something inside and cleaned it off himself!  I'll update on the food after we order  Ok, I ordered their new rice dish. It was a cross between a paella and fried rice. It was a touch spice in a perfect way with shrimp, crab, pulled pork and a sunny side egg served in a beautiful statement piece hot pot that has been baked in the oven for hours. YUMMY!!!!"}
{"text":"A perfect place to visit when you you're torn between a Asian and Mexican food craving! This place is not only beautiful and modern on the inside, but the food is delicious! Sushi is fresh with perfect flavors, loved the fish tacos, and the pomegranate guacamole is a must try! The staff is also very kind, patient, and awesome at helping you order. Will definitely come back when I'm in AZ!"}
{"text":"Okay I love this place. You have to try the Chinese sausage and pineapple fried rice, it is the BEST fried rice i've ever had. The tacos are pretty good but i highly suggest their asian food over the mexican.  The rolls are also delicious and fresh- try the dragon roll with crab substitute instead of tuna. I honestly expected the prices to be more outrageous considering the atmosphere but they're not too bad. If you go on a weekend night expect a younger crowd loud music and dim lights. It's a really fun time but just know what you're in for. The bar has two huge screen tvs so it's a fun place to watch a game. The drinks are all so unique and always tasty you can't go wrong with any of them. Edit: We went for an anniversary and made the reservation through open table so I was able to add in the occasion. They surprised us with complimentary champagne and chocolate cake. The staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Delicious guacamole and fresh made chips! We went on a Friday night with a group of seven people. We made reservations and our table was ready when we arrived. I had the Pad Thai made gluten free which was just okay. The medium spice that I opted for was just right though. My husband had the noodle bowl. It was very spicy but he enjoyed it. Some of our friends who ordered tacos (two per order) were surprised that the tacos were so small. They ended up ordering more to share because two per person wasn't quite enough. They really liked the pastor style tacos. Overall we liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. The one real complaint for the evening was in regard to the woman's bathroom. It only has two stalls which didn't seem big enough for a restaurant of that size."}
{"text":"This is truly a foodie fusion heaven.  Everything from the decor to the personable and knowledgeable waitstaff to the meal was perfection.  Every person we interacted with shared insights on the food, was incredibly friendly, and made me feel right at home.  I wanted to ask our server (Stephanie, I think) to join us for dessert - I liked her that much!  For lunch, my mom and I shared two orders of tacos (chicken and fish).  Both were completely different, but bursting with unique flavor.  We also loved the chili-garlic noodles.  Perfect amount of heat.    We had a delicious chocolate bread pudding for dessert, which was a solid way to round out this fabulous meal.  Go here.  Soon.  You'll thank me."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining at SumoMaya this week, the day after Valentine's Day. We arrived right at 7 without reservations, but we were able to sit at the counter next to the kitchen with no waiting. The restaurant staff was very busy when we arrived, and although it took a few moments for our server to get to us, he let us know he saw us and that he would be on his way soon. As busy as he was, he was super chill when interacting with us. Our server gave us some excellent suggestions - we always like to hear if the staff has any favorite recommendations. The chef gave us a complimentary salad while we waited for our food - what a fantastic gesture! It was delicious! We really enjoyed watching the kitchen staff operate. The kitchen was running efficiently and the staff was very professional. We ordered the miso soup, kimchi fried rice, a red dragon roll, and the apple salmon roll. The food was excellent - all of it. It tasted freshly made, it was beautifully prepared and visually appealing, the hot food was hot, and the rolls were perfect. Our service was top notch. Every staff member was very courteous and everyone seemed to love their job. The restaurant is beautiful, and I enjoyed the overall ambience, though I have to agree with another previous review in that it was quite noisy. I am self admittedly over-sensitive to noise in a restaurant, so no surprise there. Based on my first and only experience at SumoMaya, I would highly recommend it! I think our server's name was Mike, but I can't recall for certain."}
{"text":"Sumo Mark's stomach had to check this place out. Mayan Mark was just simply hungry. Also was looking for a new place to take some friends. Let's GO!  This is a interestingly and somewhat unusual restaurant. The outside is very plain looking while the inside is something completely different. Just look for the two large glass doors on the west side to enter the building. I had a tricky time trying to locate them. Note to self ...  Once inside the adventure begins. The decor and the layout are very cool and inviting. Really love the open kitchen concept and the crazy sick bar with the giant TV's. There is a large fake tree in the middle of the room that reminded me of an Ewok village in that Star movie.  Came here with some friends that like to try everything and share. The plates are a little bit on the small side and you can easily split several of them without trying very hard. The presentation of the dishes is stunning and create an instant photo opportunity.  We started with the Lump Crab Guacamole and ordered some extra chips. It was delicious and went nicely with their homemade Habanero Mango Sauce. Next the ladies chose the Pad Thai Al Pastor dish and went mild on the spice and also ordered some Miso Eggplant. Couldn't stop there and got a Suzuki Roll and finished off the meal with the Crispy Chicken Mole.  There wasn't anything that we did not like. Our favorites were the Pad Thai Al Pastor and the Crispy Chicken Mole. The Miso Eggplant was also very good and both my wife and her friend really did not enjoy eggplant until now.  Service was very friendly and most helpful. We easily spent an hour or more just goofing off and eating the dishes. Read a few other reviews that said it was very noisy during the dinner hours. We came during lunch and it was not very busy and the noise level was pleasantly low.  Get ready for a good time and check out your surroundings. You may even see some of your Yelp friends. Had a chance to see the lovely Ursula D and her eating companion as they left the building. I was not absolutely sure it was her until she checked in at the last moment. SIMPLY SUMOTASTICO!  4.5 STARS"}
{"text":"Went there a couple of weeks ago with my good friend who has finally decided to give sushi a try. I did have a couple of rolls, but my favorite was the Rollo Chingon; Spanish for Badass Roll.  You have to try the Guacamole, I forgot if they put crab or oysters on it, but worth the shot. But, wasn't too thrilled with the noodles we ordered. Nonetheless, a great scene and the staff was very friendly. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Super overpriced. The food was good but not worth the price. Our bill was expensive; we kept having to order because their portions were tiny. My sister and I ordered ceviche for $16 (I believe) and the portion was barely enough for one person."}
{"text":"After getting use to how reasonable many of the restaurants were in AZ in comparison to the Bay Area, SumoMaya is one of the pricier options we tried but I knew I was in for a treat when I walked in to the sounds of the islands since the manager is from Hawai`i.  Although Yelp hours have them listed as being open from lunch through dinner, I did notice they have an hour break where they close between I believe 3-4PM.  Luckily we made it there in time for a late lunch.    Admittedly I was so hungry that I did not get a chance to really savor the individual ingredients (apparently that was Brussel Sprout slaw on top) in the crispy pork belly roll as I practically inhaled it.  What I did taste was very good and the slaw does lighten up what could've been a heavy option.    The good thing is after I satisfied those hunger pains, I did get a chance to slowly enjoy my choice of 3 tacos with veggie side which I felt was the best value if you want to try different flavors and in itself would've been enough to satisfy you for lunch as long as you did not come in starving.  Wanting a variety, I got the al pastor (pork), Korean beef, and battered cod tacos with a good sized side of Mexican corn.  The Mexican corn had a nice creaminess to the taste that was nicely offset by the crunch of the popcorn on the top (I do suggest moving the popcorn to your plate when you get it to avoid sogginess).  Out of the tacos, my favorite was the al pastor due to the flavor combination of grilled pineapple, avocado, and pickled red onions that highlighted the pork beautifully, followed by the Korean beef with pickled veggies, with the cod being my least favorite of the 3 as I felt it was too bland for me.    If you get the mahi adobo, make sure to add rice for $2 as the protein itself is on the small side and you need the rice to make use of all the great flavors from the sauce.  The chicken mole with plantains came with a small scoop of rice so was a heartier option and really hits multiple taste buds with this dish, from the sweetness of the plantains to the savoriness of the chicken to the slight but mildly spicy punch of the mole sauce.    Overall, they did a wonderful job in fusing the Mexican and Asian flavors together."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch when my room wasn't ready. I loved the good, the drinks AND the service so much , I brought my husband back for dinner. We had the Mexican and the sushi both! Best sushi ever!! Loved the unique tacos!! We will be back"}
{"text":"Made reservations over a month ago. They called to confirmed our reservation that afternoon. When we got there there was no table available. We waited for 40 min and still no table available and management was very rude. Don't waste your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"My mom and I just ate lunch there and I would never go back. We both live in the area and were excited to try it. The service was terrible. It took us forever to get our food and when it did come my pad thai was ok not great and my moms veggie torta was also mediocre. The main reason I will never go back is when we ordered desert our server verbally told us the menu and we ordered the cheesecake. When it came it was covered in peanuts after I specifically told the server I was allergic when I ordered the pad thai peanut free. I'm leaving on a flight and didn't have time for them to make me something else. So overall mediocre food and terrible service."}
{"text":"I love SumoMaya. I  have been there several times and it has been good every time. I have gotten great service and the manager Tai was super nice and welcoming. My hubby and I have added SumoMaya to our date night list of favorite places!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and the food and service are top notch!  Great place to take out of town guests.  Love the vibe and the food is phenomenal.  Great mix of Asian dishes and Mexican dishes.  The eggplant miso is to die for!"}
{"text":"Very eclectic menu.......Asian, Mexican with a very interesting twist.....we had a few small plates so we can try all of the difference tastes......fish tacos were very good.....atmosphere was very good.....we enjoyed it very much.....the one knock was the Korean beef was a bit tough....."}
{"text":"Waited about 10-15 to get greeted, they seated us and waited about 20min for our waitress to come to our table after that we said we were just gonna leave and that was that"}
{"text":"This place is hard to get into unless you have reservations or sitting at the sushi bar is an option.  And it so happened that we wanted to sit at the sushi bar near the back and enjoy girl talk, a glass of wine and good rolls.  It's a total Scottsdale scene.  Loud, hip, and good people watching.    The charred edamame was a bit spicy but good.  I can't remember the actual name of the rolls but they were fresh and yummy.  Very filling.  Service was ok.  It's  just a busy place."}
{"text":"I would have to say one of the better designs of restaurants I've seen in the metro area.  Who ever designed this place I would give an A+ to.  The place seemed very sleek, contemporary and welcoming.    Service at first was a bit slow- but that is expected when the restaurant is packed but once the person came to our table there was a friendly vibe and gave some of their fav recommendations which I can tell were actually genuine.    Now the food on the other hand wasn't bad, but it was basically just okay.  Started with the calamari which was actually very good.  The light dusting of sauce made it very yummy, and not to much breading so that was delicious.  So next was the taco's which I was dying to try.  So we ordered 4 different ones.  The first was the Korean Beef Taco everyone was raving about.  Was good, don't get me wrong but seemed to lack a certain something.  The wild mushroom taco was our favorite as it was bursting with mushrooms, flavor and had enough creme sauce to take away any dryness.  Third taco up was the tempura cod- which again seemed to lack any flavor but the fish was cooked well as was the vegetables and guac.    Lastly was the Pork taco that looked the best but couldn't taste any of the pineapple flavor or salsa but only the pickled onion and guac.     One the plus side, the cocktails are poured perfectly!  Won't give up since everyone has good days and bad days so there are lots of other items to give it a chance"}
{"text":"We went in for happy hour. Erica was our server and she was great. She answered all of our questions, and showed us (and explained) the dinner menu, so we understood the Asian/mex fusion, and so would come back for more.   Food was great- we ordered gauc, chicken, fish, and mushroom tacos, edamame, calamari, tuna roll--and everything tasted fresh and was presented well.   We will definitely be back for dinner. The decor and atmosphere reminds me of a a lot of the restaurants I went to in England and Europe when I lived there, so it was a refreshing surprise when we walked in to see something designed so well.  I look forward to tasting their dinners!"}
{"text":"Thanks to mgr Jason and server Nicole, I am happy to update my review of SumoMaya. Took our daughter who is visiting from Austin (quite the foodie-scene where she lives and even she was impressed) last night.  Waited a few minutes with an 8:45 reservation on a Friday night. The place was PACKED. Jason made a special effort to make sure this visit went well (first time, not-so-much). Started with pomegranate guacamole, which was delicious (though very few Pom seeds) and Korean beef tacos--a huge hit. Hubby's fried rice went over well and sushi was delish and fresh. Seasonal mushrooms on the side were worth the effort as we all enjoyed them. I've had the Tamarind Shrimp both times and it's time to try something else. It's good, but very rich and salty. This is a fun and hip place and I love the funky decor. Looking forward to returning and bringing friends along to share more interesting options."}
{"text":"Super cute kitschy vintage retro vibe.  It's an Asian Mexican fusion and they pull it off flawlessly.  Service was great and we got each dish as it was ready - and I appreciate that.  Let me have my food when it's hot.    The guacamole with toasted pumpkin seeds was delicious as was the tuna roll and the cookie ice cream sandwich.  I need to come back here when I'm not driving..."}
{"text":"So the first time we tried out SumoMayo was opening weekend. Wasn't at all impressed. But went again last night for a friends birthday and wow, they've come a long way! The chips and pomegranate guac were awesome.  For dinner, I ordered the chopped salad and it was much larger than I expected with tons of veggies and super flavorful. I asked the waiter if they had another dressing option, like balsamic vinegar or anything else and he said no, which was surprising since their other salads had different dressing options? So instead I used some the soy sauce on the table and it was a-ok. My husband got the ceasar salad, which was also generously sized and very tasty.  Everyone in our party was happy with their meals and and then the desserts...wow, everything was so yum! Glad we had the opportunity to give it another try and will certainly be back.  **fyi- it is a bit loud and difficult to carry conversations across the table***"}
{"text":"WOW, am I really the 1000th review? Better make this quick.  SumoMaya is a trendy fusion brunch place for the hipster crowd. It's 100% the kind of place I would bring my sorority sisters if they ever visited me in Arizona. I can imagine this place is fun for dinner too but I came for the bottomless brunch as an early Valentine's Day date with the boyfriend.   PROS: - You get to order unlimited appetizers, sides, and desserts - in any order you want - and get to wrap up the entree to take home. - Food presentation. - Trendy atmosphere and music. - Bottomless drinks = yes. - An interesting menu with unique combinations of food. - Service. They had a few hiccups like forgetting some orders and you get served by ALL the waiters, meaning some wires get crossed when ordering, but it's honestly not a big deal.  CONS: - Majority of the unlimited brunch appetizers were just so-so; nothing tasted so amazing that it blew me out of the water. - The three sides I ordered (both kinds of potato hash and the sausage rice) just tasted like salt and weren't that good.  BOTTOMLESS APPETIZER REVIEW: - Sweet bread: Probably my favorite out of the appetizer menu. There was two kinds of bread but I preferred the yellower one. I devoured this entire basket on my own.  - Tres leches oatmeal: I was most excited to try this dish. Unfortunately, it just tasted like plain hot oatmeal with walnuts. However, it comes with a dish of sweet milk that you can pour over the oatmeal, and that makes a world of difference. Once you've poured the whole dish of milk, the oatmeal becomes a LOT sweeter. I guess it's good because if you don't like sweets, you can adjust the sweetness of your oatmeal. But I'm just thinking, who is ordering TRES LECHES oatmeal and doesn't like sweets?! I thought maybe the oatmeal would be sweet on its own without needing the milk. But no. You need the milk for sure. P.S. The milk dish comes with a surprise at the bottom... little candied apricots or something!  - Pomegranate guacamole: This was a must-try because of all the reviews I saw about it! Honestly, it just tasted like plain guacamole, and the pomegranate pieces just looked cool.. that is, until you get some of the candied apricots. Forget the pomegranate, the pieces of apricot is what made the guacamole stand out. The chewiness and sweetness of the apricot combined with the guac was amazing. Boyfriend and I debated ordering another one of these but we were way too full.   - Sushi platter: 6 rolls. I can't really comment because boyfriend ordered and ate this instead of me, but he had no complaints  BOTTOMLESS ENTREE REVIEW: - Wagyu steak: Boyfriend got this wagyu and egg dish. The wagyu was just OK. They were, in my opinion, VERY heavyhanded on the lime juice. Seriously, it was like drenched in lime. I felt kinda meh about this dish.  - Al pastor pad thai: I ordered this extra spicy and it was just a smidge spicy, but it wasn't bad. At first I was disappointed because I usually prefer my pad thai sweet, and this one is more on the sour side. But it actually grew on me after a few bites - I think the combination of ingredients work really well together. Definitely happy with my order!  BOTTOMLESS SIDES & DESSERTS REVIEW: - Wok fried potato hash: This just tasted salty and bland. It looked exactly like the other hash side, and I honestly couldn't tell which was which after I tried both potatoes. Waste of space in my stomach. My boyfriend said this \"tasted slightly better [than the chorizo hash] and more Asian but they're basically the same.\"  - Chorizo hash: Salty thick potato taste. Not good. Tasted exactly like the wok fried potato hash, honestly. Save room in your stomach and just order one side.  - Chinese sausage fried rice: On the other hand, this didn't taste salty enough. In fact, it tasted like nothing rice. Pass.  - Liquid cheesecake: AMAZING. I thought it couldn't get any better. Honestly, the cheesecake tastes really good on its own, and I feel like the berries are just for presentation. I could seriously come here for the bottomless brunch and only load up on desserts, and no appetizers. LOL.   - Bunuelos: I thought nothing could top the liquid cheesecake, but I was mistaken. These cinnamon chips are incredibly good, and I don't even like cinnamon. They are drizzled with caramel and tastes amazing.  Sumomaya has some cons, and not all the dishes were spectacular. Still, I had a good time, and there is enough variety in the menu that you can find a dish you enjoy enough to get your money's worth and load up on. Also, the atmosphere and level of service make up for any subpar appetizer or sides you may have encountered. The whole vibe of the restaurant just screams FUN. I could definitely imagine bringing my girlfriends here and loading up on mimosas while we rehash whatever ratchetivites happened the night before."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!!  Sushi, tacos, guac.  The issue was it was too loud to visit, too loud to hear the waiter.   Not a fan."}
{"text":"First off, I don't really understand this concept. I have dined here three separate times and had three very separate experiences  the first time we dined there was in the evening on a Wednesday night, there were two of us. We were seated immediately, had the greatest most bubbly server who took great care of us. We also both have food allergies, so she was excellent with that.  The last time I dined here, and was excited to take my friends before a alumnae meeting. There were planned to be 6 of us. When I walked in, a friend was already waiting so I went up and said \"We have a party of six.\" the hostess just stared at me blankly and then said \"well do you have a reservation?\" mind you, this was at 4:30 in the afternoon and the restaurant was DEAD, completely empty. I said no, and she proceeded to address the business men next to us, who had a reservation and got them seated.   Maybe ten minutes later she still had not said anything to us, and finally she came over and asked if we could sit in the corner booth, which was fine.   The next  crappy part was our service. We had a taller dark haired woman as our server who was simply annoyed we were sitting there. I tried to crack a joke and she just looked at me. We had arrived first so we ordered wine and some guacamole. Our other friends got lost so they ended up showing up 20 minutes later and the waitress had the same crappy attitude towards them. We also asked for advice on which Pinot Noir and which Malbec to drink and she rolled her eyes at us. It was a very bad experience compared to the first one.  Overall, I don't think I will be going back there, mostly because I'm not quite sure why you have to have a reservation at 4pm, why the hostesses are very snotty, and why the service is so inconsistent."}
{"text":"The place is pretty... But all the food is average. If your middled aged newly discovered and looking for the next Mr or Mrs This is your spot! But food... Nothing to write home about!"}
{"text":"Sumo Maya is both innovative and high quality.  While the \"Mexican, Asian Fusion\" sounded a bit scary at first, the menu is better described as both Mexican AND Asian rather than fusion.  The Tacos are fantastic and the Sushi is some of the best in the area.  Sumo Maya is also a great place to watch a game as the bar has an extensive drink menu as well as several large televisions."}
{"text":"Ok. Loved the ambiance, but for what the menu was,  felt it was a tad over priced for the breakfast brunch. Added the drinks for and extra $10. That was worth it because we drank the heck out of those! Lol. Everything was tasty except my main meal, the wagyu beef was over cooked, tough,  and bland.  The price and over cooked meal is why I gave it 3 stars."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and it was expensive for what you receive.  However, the food was really quiete good and the restaurant was very well designed.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Had brunch with a friend from out of town that was with some of her friends. Incredible food and the mimosas are amazing! Blood orange, passion fruit and mango! WOW. Nina was so incredible as well as the managers ,Jason, Michelle and Austin. The chef Erick makes the best ahi tacos I've ever had! I'll be back often! They really make you feel great and they're excited to have you there."}
{"text":"Wow. Fantastic. Delicious. This place is amazing. Go. Do not hesitate. The Bottomless Brunch is worth every penny. We went for Father's Day and all four in our group must have said \"wow\" 10 times each.  The churro waffles topped with chocolate ice cream were a definite hit. The Korean Fried Chicken Torta was unlike anything I've ever had and absolutely amazing.  The service was swift, friendly and efficient.  Best meal any of us has had in a long time."}
{"text":"Love this place , came in for lunch (1st time diner) to try their pork belly ramen , it was not on the menu however the manager took his time and said he will try to ask the kitchen to accommodate the request and they did , service is excellent , food is well made. Great concept and wonderful ambience ! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food is great EVERY TIME. the Korean tacos to die for, shaken beef is incredible, drinks are always on point, customer service is great. Wish the music wasn't so loud but maybe I'm just getting old! Doesn't stop me from coming back"}
{"text":"What a beautiful, unique, delicious new restaurant. Sampled a little bit of everything!!  Mushroom tacos, dried fruit guac, yellowtail ceviche, summer corn, and chicken mole...all of which were phenomenal. The plating is especially beautiful, with each dish looking like a work of art. Also pleasantly surprising were the prices, which at this level of quality, combined with the location, I would have expected to be far higher.  Service was equally excellent, as is the ambience. I hope this place is very successful!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a bachelorette party and it was amazing! Such good food, great cocktails and killer service. I can't say enough good things about this place. Get the seafood chaufa rice it was amazing."}
{"text":"**large party** we ordered 25 shots of tequila ($250) they gave us 14 shots of pure water, when we asked for the manager Mike he accused us of filling up our shot glasses with water, I was extremely offended. After 15 minutes of communicating with the manager about our concern he let us know he would take off the tab the \"shots\" we ordered. I felt cheated because his intention was to charge us $10 a shot when 14 is the 25 were water. It was bizarre and rude. I love this restaurant but Mike would not take responsibility for what happened when we were kind customers with a brunch party of 25 people... very disappointed.   BUT our server Jordan was great, very professional and a hard worker!"}
{"text":"SumoMaya has such a cool atmosphere that I was ready to love it, but service and food fell so short of mediocre. I definitely would not come back here for a meal but probably enjoying some cocktails would be fine.  The service issues started when I first arrived, 15 minutes early for a noon reservation. The restaurant was pretty empty, but there were a lot of servers, and I requested a table on the patio which has all of 4 other people. I waited for everyone else to arrive and then at noon we asked to be seated. The hostess said she just seated someone out there (nope, still 4 people) so she had to wait a little before seating us. 10 minutes later we asked to be seated again and she said if we sat inside then she could seat us immediately, so we agreed to just sitting inside. We each ordered an entree but everything came out separately. And by separately I mean 5-6 minutes apart. I get bringing food out when it's ready if people are sharing dishes, but each person ordered their own meal (salad...not shareable food) and I go out to eat so I can eat with other people. If I wanted to eat my meal by myself, I would stay home.   Then the food just wasn't very good. I got the vegetarian chopped salad (one of the very few vegetarian options available) and I just did not like it - the greens were a little too hard, the mushrooms has a bad rubbery texture, and the smoke flavor was just awful."}
{"text":"Went there on a Friday night and have to say top 5 meal of my life.  I got the ahi tuna tacos and Korean beef tacos and they were so amazing.  My wife got the Carne asada and said it was perfectly cooked.  It is a fun environment with great service.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour great selection of food and drinks. I had the sake sangria it was sooo refreshing.  We also had tacos and the spicy tuna roll. All were sooo good! Would come back if in town again. The only thing is that the cocktails rang up on the wrong price it was quickly fixed but glad we caught the mistake. Also only valet parking it's complimentary but I still rather park my own car."}
{"text":"The tacos were very good, esp the mushroom taco. Decor is interesting. The location is preppy. Go for it if you want a fancy taco joint !"}
{"text":"I waited so long to visit this place I finally did last night and had a terrible experience with our drinks and service. Bartenders think they own the place, sour experience with them and their attitude, drinks were returned twice we left after 30 minutes. I didn't have any food but We do not think  we will be back with that customer service & quality of drinks.."}
{"text":"Five stars for the ambiance for sure! As soon as you walk in the atmosphere is downright AMAZING. We had a party of 7 and actually made a reservation... however, we weren't seated until 30 minutes after that prior made reservation. Nonetheless we had great service and that made up for the wait. Now to the food; I wouldn't say I'm a picky eater at all I LOVE everything to be honest but this time was odd...  Everything we tried was just SO different that I couldn't tell if it was an acquiring taste or just not that good. We had the apple-salmon roll and it was good but not great. Adding to that we had the Chinese spicy crab and garlic noodles, SO SPICY! (By the way, I love everything hot and this was crazy)  All in all, the restaurants vibes were amazing but the food was just very different. I can't say I hate it but I most likely won't ever want to eat there again."}
{"text":"We went to SumoMaya on Saturday night, so it was fairly busy.  The food was very good and most dishes ranged from $10-$15 with a few closer to $20.  I had the eel and avocado roll and the ramen - both of which were very tasty.  My husband had the suzuki roll which he said was good, but a little on the bland side.  In terms of atmosphere, they had a DJ playing which I found to be a little loud.  I'm sure there are plenty of people who go for this type of experience, but it's just a personal opinion of mine.    The downside for us was that all of our food came out at different times.  We were a table of 6 and ordered our meals all at the same time.  Dishes began coming out of the kitchen and there was probably a 20 minute gap between the first and last dish.  I understand that they have a sushi bar and are a fusion restaurant, so likely have multiple kitchens that food will be coming from, but it was a little strange to have one person completely finished with their meal before someone else even received theirs."}
{"text":"This is probably the best fusion restaurant I've been to. Even though it says fusion, you can get some really authentic Mexican and Japenese dishes. There are some awesome fusion dishes as well (sushi roll w/ guacamole). The service is amazing as well as the atmosphere. I've never been a fan of eggplant, but the Japanese eggplant is phenomenal. After moving to AZ 4 months ago, I've to this restaurant the most and have enjoyed it every single time. If you go, you have to try the BACON WRAPPED MEDJOOL DATES aka orgasm on a plate. The dates are stuffed with chorizo and queso chihuahua, and served over a bed of foie gras sauce. It's probably the only restaurant I've been eating and wondered if a DJ was playing the music in the background...and I was correct. Probably the only time I've enjoyed a sushi roll while bouncing to BBD \"Poison\"."}
{"text":"Best experience have had at a restaurant in a long time.  They really have hit a home run here and we got first class treatment here.  The food was amazing and the overall energy of this place makes you want to stay.  I'm a fan!! :)"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise, beautiful restaurant, open airy, and the food was fantastic. we attended a graduation party for around 20 people and everyone loved the food and service, and the prices are reasonable for the quality and presentation.I highly recommend this restaurant for small or large parties."}
{"text":"We were a little bit skeptical at first to see a Mexican and Asian fusion restaurant but we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food  and exceptional taste of the dishes. We ordered the Pad Thai and the Kimchee Rice and both were excellent. The staff was friendly and attentive. If you're looking for a quiet place to have a conversation, this may not be the place for you or you definitely want to sit in the outside seating as the music is very loud. But if we are in Scottsdale again, we would not hesitate to eat here."}
{"text":"The place is gorgeous and unique. The food itself was very tasteful and the drinks were good. However, the service was absolutely awful. Not friendly upon entrance or when seated, our service was not personable at all (no pleasant greeting, no asking for refills, ignored us for extended times, when we asked for our bill would say just wait, didn't tell us to have a good night or thank you, and the hostesses did not say thanks, have a great night either when leaving). I am HUGE on respect and manners, so I will not be back here again. Not to mention, the $16 meal I ordered that was supposed to consist of octopus, shrimp, crab, and calamari was literally 5 quarter size pieces of seafood with some sauce and maybe 1/6 a cup of beet and a glob of pickled daikon. I wouldn't even get full from that as a snack.. We had an $80 meal that barely got us over our stomach pains."}
{"text":"The coolest spot in Scottsdale.  Food...service...atmosphere....pretty women...EVERYTHING was double great.  After too many cocktails...and too many very tasty entrees...our group left singing the praises of this new spot.  Fortunately, my wife and I were guests...and I would guess the host spent some money.  Whatever it cost was well worth it.    Can;t wait to go back."}
{"text":"They have amazing drinks and all the bartenders are super awesome but some of the wait staff seem clueless and they are very inattentive. We waited like 20 minutes one night to have a server come to our table and finally decided just to get drinks from the bar. Hopefully it was just a bad night for them."}
{"text":"Ok this place is trendy and hip I was not wowed by the food.  Roasted corn was good, friends enjoyed their sushi.  Prices were expensive  2 4\" street tacos $9.00.  It gets expensive when you order 6 orders for apps.  If you have the need to be seen this place is for you.  Our service was fantastic, food was okay.   Probably not go back when Paul Martins is less than a block away."}
{"text":"You have to try this place. The waitress suggested some things and we loved everything we got. The guacamole, the pad Thai, the pastor tacos, all delicious!!! We will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Strolled in a little after 10:00 pm on Saturday. Our late night dinner was very satisfying...where else can you get Street Tacos and Sushi Rolls while a DJ spins tunes from the hostess station?!  The Magic Mojito is always refreshing, but the Chocolate Sticky Cake with Salted Caramel Ice Cream was just amazing! Mmmmmm... Our server, Alyssa, did not skip a beat. She was attentive and efficient with quite a sense of humor. What a concept...Asian Mexican Fusion? Yes, please!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate my boyfriends 30th birthday dinner. Once again our service and food were phenomenal. This is by far one of our favorite restaurants in the Scottsdale area. We come here often and every time we are blown away. Aaron and Presley at the bar are our favorite and most memorable employees but all around this place gets 5 stars every time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere really helped to make my experience here even more enjoyable. The service was the best I have had in a long time. The staff was great. Our table ordered cocktails, the spicy tuna roll, guacamole, chicken tacos and the fried rice. The tostada that comes with the guac was way over seasoned. We also felt that the tacos were lacking a little flavor. Other than that everything was good and we will come back. The set up was perfect for people watching lol. We really enjoyed the music selection by the DJ. Food pictured below."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for a lunch date and again for a last minute Halloween dinner. All of the tacos except the chicken are delicious. The popcorn is a nice touch and perfect snack.  Each time we've had the happy hour menu available as they do a daily reverse happy hour in addition to a daily regular happy hour. The drinks are a little pricey but delicious.   I had the shrimp for dinner in a chimichurri sauce with tomatoes and Serrano peppers. Amazing! I did expect more than two shrimp, but they are huge and it was surprisingly filling. I definitely recommend getting an appetizer.    The bartenders started cleaning up at 11 pm and didn't ask us if we wanted another drink...instead they took our glasses and didn't say a word. I was a bartender so I totally understand the concept of cleaning up early, but I always ask for a last call beforehand.   My boyfriend and I had only had one drink each at this point. We finally ordered another drink but after we ended up leaving and going to another bar because of this, otherwise we would have stayed.   Other than that, I love this place and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The anticipation of going to SumoMaya was big but so was the disappointment.  My friends and I thought we would try it for the first time and we went on a Sunday during happy hour.  The food was good but nothing amazing but the most disappointing part of the experience was the service.  It was as if the waitress was going through training or should go through training.  She took a long time to come back every time we ordered something and our drinks sat at the bar for 10 min before I asked another server to bring them to us.  Every part of the mail was disjointed.  I think there was a manager on duty but all she did was walk around and talk to the bartenders it did not seem she has any idea of what was going on.  I think it would be a good idea for leadership to review their systems and staff and determine how they could be more efficient.  I wish them the best but until these systems are in place I will not be going back.   Sincerely  Very disappointed customer"}
{"text":"Love the bottomless Mimosa & Sunday brunch! Drank all day for $29 a person-which included brunch. There was also some items on the brunch menu that were also bottomless . Great atmosphere, and fun music playing through out. We enjoyed the whole afternoon. Waitress Jordan was very nice!!"}
{"text":"I popped in here for Happy Hour with some girlfriends the other night and was pleasantly surprised to see that they had great HH specials! Usually this restaurant is PACKED so it definitely put a smile on my face to score seats at the bar AND enjoy wonderful light bites. We ordered the charred edamame ($3 and SO yum!), Guacamole ($5 - yummy but the avocado pieces were a little large and could have been mashed more), and a few sushi rolls ($7 each). They also have a variety of tacos on their HH menu (2 for $3, 3 for $5, or 4 for $7). For drinks, we had wine which was $2 off per glass! Beer is $1 off and cocktails are $2 off. I will most definitely be back soon for more girl time! And the fact that it is across from my favorite nail salon is a major plus too!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this place is way over priced. The food is OK but not amazing. I wouldn't go back a second time."}
{"text":"I've visited SumoMaya twice now and both times were a huge success. The first time I visited was during happy hour and then again for lunch. The bacon wrapped dates are a must. They also have a chicken appetizer that is really delicious. If you're a lover of condiments and sauces you'll enjoy both of those dishes. I recently had the shrimp avocado salad which was another hit. My one takeaway is that when I return it will be during happy hour and not for lunch. I preferred the HH choices and ordering several dishes to try!"}
{"text":"The decor and environment are wonderful! Really love the open layout and feel of the place. The staff were all polite. Sat at the bar with a friend for happy hour. Ordered a couple different things (chicken tacos, guacamole, edamame, California roll, and salmon avocado roll)   This place is definitely better served as Mexican. The sushi was awful and the wasabi tasted like horseradish (dyed green) I didn't even eat it. Tacos were lacking in flavor, weren't terrible but definitely not great.  The Guacamole and Edamame had to be the best of them all. Good flavors throughout each. Loved the sauce that they give with the edamame.   Beer was cold; no complaints there.  Overall not bad, a little disappointing but I wouldn't say I'd NEVER go back."}
{"text":"We love Mexican and Japanese food so a fusion of the two was a no brainer for us. The drinks are creative and delicious. The food creations are even better. My favorites are the crispy pork belly roll, pomegranate guacamole, any of the tacos and the Mexican street corn. My only complaints are without reservations it's difficult to get a table in a reasonable amount of time and the music is quite loud. The food is so good we make reservations or door dash."}
{"text":"My girlfriend wanted to celebrate her 20th wedding anniversary with her girlfriends, since her husband was out of town (she didn't know he had a surprise party planned for the weekend).  She asked me for some recommendations and I sent her an e-mail with some options.  I was happy when she chose SumoMaya, because I have been wanting to try it since it opened.  She booked a table for us, and it was the day of the big monsoon.  Since my babysitter cancelled on me, I had to drive myself, so my hubby had to stay with the twins and couldn't be my designated driver.  We had a nice table at the edge of the patio area.  It was pretty covered.  The restaurant is beautiful.  I got there and most of my friends were already there.  They had their cocktails in hand so I wanted to order one.  It took a little to get service, finally I was able to order the Lemongrass cocktail.  One of our friends arrived shortly after and it took another 10 minutes for her to be able to order her drink.  Finally, we all had our drinks, some were almost done with theirs, and we were able to toast our friend on her awesome anniversary.  We wanted to order food, again our server was near, but not looking at us, so I got up and asked her name, so I could call her next time.  Whitney finally took our food order.  We got a shrimp ceviche, really spicy but delicious.  I ordered the Rollo Chingon, a fusion sushi roll with adobo marinated grilled shrimp, guacamole, cilantro, jalape√±o and red lotus root chips with a balsamic strawberry glaze.  It was amazing, I could live on it.  We also had the vietnamese style \"shaking beef\", it was terrific.  The chinese style chile-crab garlic noodles were excellent also.   The rain started again and the manager told us that if we started getting wet, we could move to a table behind us.  As the rain strengthen, we could feel the droplets falling on us.  We told Whitney we were getting wet and we wanted to move, she said \"just scoot over\".  I had to get up and call the manager and he indeed told her we could have that table.  It was after 9p.m.  It is not like anyone else was coming.  Once we sat on the new table we were ready for our dessert, everyone started to wonder where Whitney went, she was just by the bar, hanging out, so I got up again and asked the manager if we had a different server for the new table, since we had been there over 15 minutes and no one came.  He said Whitney was our server.  He sent her over and we placed our dessert order and some coffee requests.   This place is great and I docked a star because of the service, my friends were so upset, that I didn't argue when they wanted to leave only 10% for service.  I will definitely go again, but I will make sure not to get Whitney as my server."}
{"text":"First time here tonight. What a cool place. Really fun atmosphere. Great service and the food was Amazing.   The music was a little too loud but our awesome waitress Jeanette turned it down for us. She was smoking hot!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice looking place, unfortunately I won't be returning.  Everyone in my table was done eating and I was still waiting on my food.  I asked the waiter and he said oh yeah it's coming.  Later he brought out one of my items and apologist. More time goes by I'm done with my sushi roll, still waiting on my tacos.  once again I try to get my waiter's attention. I asked about the rest of my order and says he didn't know I have order a second item. At that time my friend also order another drink. I get my tacos after over an hour wait and my friend never got her drink.  She asked him again and he said oh I'm sorry I thought you were done.  My glass of water was only refilled once.  If this would of happen in another restaurant the manager would of come out and made the situation better not here. All the waiter did was discount the cheapest item on my bill a total of a $8 discount to make up for over and hour wait.  My time is worth more than that!"}
{"text":"In terms of aesthetics and atmosphere, SumoMaya is typically the type of Scottsdale establishment I avoid like the plague.  Loud crowds, loud house music, loud acoustics.  Its an introvert's nightmare (particularly for ISTJs like me if you're into Myers-Briggs).  That said, SumoMaya's unique culinary experiment is nevertheless intriguing and a curious foodie like me would be foolish to write off a place like this without having given it a shot.  Asian-Latin America fusion restaurants are nothing new in the valley (i.e. Chino Bandido and Adobo Dragon to name a few), but SumoMaya's version is distinctly upscale from other fusion creations I've been to.  After recently seeing SumoMaya featured on Check Please Arizona, I finally made the drive here for an early dinner on Sunday.  You'll find SumoMaya on the northwest corner of Scottsdale Road and Lincoln embedded in a mixed use commercial plaza.  The centerpiece of the restaurant is unquestionably the bar area which has twin big screen TVs on opposite sides with an impressive assortment of wines, beers, spirits, and sakes.  Surrounding the bar area, there's a mix of booth and high table seating that back up to windows which can be opened up to the outside as they were this evening.  I'd guess this place can cram upwards of 150 at capacity.  I grabbed one of the last seats remaining at the bar for this evening.  On a funny note, it turned out the bartenders were all wearing the same blue checkered Brooks Brothers shirt that I was (one even asked if my shift was starting soon, before I set the record straight).  Anyways, let's get to the evening's meal.  The menu here is a mix of traditional Asian and Latin American dishes plus an assortment of fusion mashups.  I can get the stand alone items anywhere so I made a point of getting as many mashups as possible for my first visit.  That included my drink, the Lychee Daisy Margarita.  Sake mixed with lemon juice, orange, and lychee (basically a tropical Chinese fruit).  A very pleasant and light cocktail with subtle palette awakening fruit notes.  For my app, it was a Sumo Roll.  I asked the bartender which of their Sumo Rolls were the best.  He recommended the Red Dragon Roll.  And this one packs a wallop.  Tuna, eel, avocado, cucumber, jalape√±os, pomegranates, rice, unagi sauce (basically a thicker sweeter version of soy sauce), and a chipotle aioli.  Fantastic mix of Asian and Latin American flavors and the thick savory mix of sauces rounded out eat bite perfectly.  The spice level hit me a bit at first, but not nearly enough to take away from the quality of this dish.  For my main course, it seems like the Pork Al Pastor Pad Thai is SumoMaya 101 on a plate, so I went that direction.  Pork, egg noodles, peanuts, scallions, pickled jalape√±o, bean sprouts, and tamarind fruit.  The flavors in this dish were more mellow but no less delicious.  The spice level on this one was muted, but the savoriness of the pork and the noodles were more than enough to make my taste buds happy.  I can understand why this is their best seller.  For dessert, I gave their famous Tres Leches Cake a try.  A moist cake sitting atop a bed of mangos and cream and topped with meringue.  I loved the tart element the mangos brought to the table and I'm pretty much a sucker for any meringue dessert you put in front of me.  An excellent meal all around with plenty of surprises.  Total cost for the drink, food, tax and tip came to $75.  Some items on the menu are more expensive than others (I saw a couple of Japanese Wagyu dishes that will set you back quite a bit for the indulgence), but they also have happy hour specials which can provide a reasonable meal for under $20.  Like I said, the food here is more upscale than similar Asian-Latin fusion spots in town, but in this case I mean that positively.  And those coming in the door can take comfort knowing that the two executive chefs (Lorenzo Lopez and Eiji Takase) are Latin and Asian respectively.  Their combined talents have yielded a menu full of interesting combinations you likely won't find elsewhere, making the extra money spent here worth every penny.  I may not fit in with the Scottsdale movers and shakers, but I'll happily come back to SumoMaya for a culinary adventure."}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant! The decor, the vibe, the colors, the concept, the chefs, & especially the food!! Everything is fresh, tasty, & uniquely presented. I have been here 3 times now & have loved it better than the last. The menu is so expansive that it can please the choosiest of eaters. The food comes out quickly & the drinks are so delicious!! This is my new favorite place in town!! It's now open for lunch which is even more exciting! Keep up the good work because you have a hit on your hands!!"}
{"text":"The surroundings are an eclectic blend of cowboy and a sort of hip LA vibe. The bartenders wear black, almost ballet-like, form fitting clothing. Our waiter was very attentive and able to rattle through the menu at lightening speed. He spent a considerable amount of time talking about what to order--almost to a fault. Service is family style with a warning that if you order individual plates they may not come out together. We ordered the higher end tenderloin dish with a mushroom sauce to share. The sauce was overly salty and a few of my pieces of not chew-worthy. The salmon sushi was the best selection and enjoyed it. We tried the Pad Thai--a mistake. The noddles were slightly overcooked and the dish lacked flavor. We also had a beef dish with onions and leaks in a brown sauce that was good but not great. Overall, this is a place to be seen, especially for older singles, and to drive up in a fancy car, but not a place for true foodies."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The service is very friendly and on point. They are pretty consistent each time I go with the quality of customer service, food presentation and drinks! The venue itself is colorful and amazing! My new favorite place to be! I recommend this place for a hot date, couples fun night out or even a daytime brunch with friends! I love their deals on bottomless drinks! Check it out I highly recommend this place see you there!"}
{"text":"Hands down- my favorite place! My first time going was a Saturday night (highly recommend making a reservation on weekend nights) & the atmosphere was breathtaking. From the moment you walk in the door you will notice a huge tree in the center of the dining area. Their bar is large and has tvs surrounding it. On this particular night, there was a DJ who played fun and lively music that had music videos on the tv screens. Their Mexican-Japanese fusion food has never disappointed me. I've enjoyed their pork belly raman, street tacos and sushi. This menu doesn't have a single item on it that doesn't sound appetizing. The staff has always been very knowledgeable of food items, which has been helpful for avoiding food allergies. Any chance that I get I am recommending this restaurant to family, friends, and clients."}
{"text":"Went to pre-opening.  Sensational menu of Japanese and Mexican inspired dishes, many featuring elements of both.  Two chefs, one from each tradition.  Owned by Jerman Aseo (surely spelled wrong by me), of Central Bistro and Local Bistro.  The drink menu is terrific, too.  We enjoyed bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo, crispy pork belly sushi rolls, sake and sesame Japanese eggplant, chicken mole, sliced 35 day dry aged New York strip steak, sliced over fresh mushrooms and a coconut milk sauce with roasted leeks, tuna ceviche tossed in Aji Amarillo sauce and served in a coconut placed in an ice bowl, hamachi sashimi in a mysterious green sauce garnished with micro greens, and many more.  Tried a Magic Mojito, made with frozen horchata and loads of fresh mint, and a Passion Fruit cocktail with Mescal, passion fruit juice and ginger beer in a copper mug.  Service is well trained and savvy.  Interiors are high end design, with innovations such as a green grassy perimeter fence on the patio hung with giant, framed mirrors, movable shade screens that enclose the patios while misters and massive air conditioning capacity cool both indoor and outdoor space, and a huge man made tree in the main dining area.  Exhibition kitchen.    Located in a new strip center at the northwest corner of Scottsdale Road and Lincoln Drive.  Entrees are smallish plates best shared with your table mates.  Prices ranged from $8 to $18.    Well worth a visit to experience the innovative menu and expensive buildout.  Acoustics are good, not too noisy even when full."}
{"text":"Love the food and the area! It's one of the best fusion food I have tried! The shishito peppers are amazing and they have an eggplant dish that is great! Only thing is this place is super busy and not always the best customer service as far as being seated . So definitely need to have a reservation 2-3 weeks ahead of time."}
{"text":"I would describe SumoMayo as an adventurous Asian Mexican Fusion experience. We especially loved the Crispy Chicken Mole which included plantains and a flavorful mole sauce. The bacon guacamole was made with pork belly that added the perfect texture to make it interesting. My personal favorite was the Apple Salmon sumo roll which had the perfect blend of spices that elevated the sushi to levels completely unexpected."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and had good experiences but this time the service at the bar was a little slow,  although very  pleasant bartenters. When we used a localdines coupon the  manager gave us a hard time with even though we were using it within the guidelines . He was not putting the customer first at all. Can't say we'll go back based on this experience considering all of the other great places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It was a surprise, as I never expected to go back, but we got an opportunity to try SumoMaya a 2nd time.  Some things were a vast improvement, others were the same as my first visit there.   This time we went earlier in the day, and our reservation was ready right on time. The place was still busy, but not packed like before and this time was dinner was much more relaxed and stress-free - I could hear our conversations. SumoMaya is very high energy, and maybe I'm just a fuddy-duddy, but the scene later in the evening is like a nightclub. I much preferred the quieter lower-key earlier dinner hour.  Our service was impeccable! Our waitress was friendly, efficient, and informative.  We also had the manager check in on us, and we felt valued and even a bit pampered. Great service, great people.  The food: We started with the guac and chips, which were more like tostadas. The guac itself was fresh and tasty, but I did not care that much for all the extras piled on top that were salty and very citrus-y. We ended up removing a lot of the peppers, they just weren't working for us. The little tostadas were crispy and seasoned with lime. My wife ordered the coconut soup, and loved it just as much as before. I also sampled it again, and just didn't care for the pungent saffron and coconut, it overwhelmed me a bit. She also got sushi which she gave top marks to; I tried the pork belly roll and found the meat to be fatty and salty, and the seaweed a bit hard to chew on. I've never been a sushi fan, so that's on me. The wife loved her sushi, though she did also remark that meat was very salty; she preferred the seafood rolls. I ordered the carne flank steak - and it was decent. I liked the sear on it, but as sometimes typical with that cut, it ended up being chewy, almost too chewy, despite it being touted as waygu.  It came with a sauce called \"Citrus mojo\" - which I found way too salty and acidic.  I also tried the tacos again, and they are still a bit of a disappointment for me. This time I tried the meat directly, just on its own, and the al pastor and Korean beef were tasty. Not knock my socks off tasty, but the Korean beef was pretty good and the al pastor was ok. Like before, I didn't like the overwhelming toppings, in particular the pickled slaw which I feel kills the savour of the meat. The corn tortillas lacked life, they were limp and bland. I feel the meat in a taco should be the central focus, and the toppings are there just to add zing or crunch, but these tacos were way too dominated by the toppings, leaving the meat to be an afterthought.  We ended with the coconut ice cream - which tasted fresh and was well complimented with toppings and things like freeze-dried coconut (?). It was a nice sweet and refreshing dessert.  Overall: the service is A+. The atmosphere is high energy and not necessarily my personal type of dinner atmosphere. I get why this place is popular and trendy though, they serve their target demographic well I assume. The food is a mixed bag - good marks for the sushi, but not for the mexican side of the fusion.  I would let the sushi be the complex art pieces that they are, and would simplify the tacos to emphasize the savoury meats not the pungent toppings."}
{"text":"Sumo Maya is great!! I love bringing friends in from out of town because it's so different and fun. The food is always awesome, the staff is friendly and attentive, and the cocktails never fail! You just can't beat the atmosphere. One of my favorite spots in town!"}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 Josh was attentive and courteous. Cleanliness: 5/5 I dropped my fork and couldn't immediately see it. Another employee noticed it and all the staff appeared to take a particular attention to cleanliness. Decor: 4/5 Too many different chair styles, it looks like the interior was designed in parts. Food: California Roll: 5/5 Best I've ever had and definitely did not skimp on the crab. Sea bass: 4/5 Marginally overcooked (still enjoyable). 2nd best miso glaze I've had. Wagyu hot stone: 4/5 Cooking yourself at the table top is nice. The meat was a decent portion for the price, but not the best wagyu I've had. Sauces and salts were interesting however if the Chef further developed the flavor options, that could help warrant a 5/5 rating."}
{"text":"So after my first meal in the new SodaSopa district of Southpark at SumoMaya, I must say I am quite pleased. Being a Yelp reviewer I was seated immediately and the server pretty much blew me.  Now down to brass tax:  Korean Beef Tacos = Major win  Pork belly eggs Benedict = equals a slightly lesser win (kind of like that time I dunked on a midget) not my finest moment and yet, oddly satisfying."}
{"text":"The food was \"good\", but not worth the price. Way overpriced. Two rolls, 4 street tacos, and 4 slices of plantains-all of which were ~6 or 7/10- for $60+tip. Nope. Won't go there again."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what's better: the eclectic food options or the people watching. Expect unique Mexican/asian fusion food, great bar space with huge TVs and Vegas-esque interiors (there's a tree in the middle of the restaurant). Guac with crab, specialty margaritas, garlic noodles, tacos (which are very reasonably priced) were all hits with me. This would be a fun place to take out of town guests as it does bring in a quintessentially Scottsdale crowd PLUS it's a local pick as all Osio restaurants currently operate in Scottsdale or Phoenix."}
{"text":"Delicious! Stunning and super alive/fun/chic/beautiful interior!! We had a party of 9 plus a baby in a stroller and it was ALL so good and service excellent. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting...it's in a little random shopping center, but definitely transports you when you're inside. We'll be back, for sure."}
{"text":"Wow. This place was amazing. This place had the rare combination of being great quality, original and fairly priced.   I had never been to an Asian-Mexican Fusion Restaurant, so this was an entirely new experience for me. My BF and I were lucky to arrive during reverse happy hour (10pm - close) by chance, which had great deals on a selection of tacos, rolls, cocktails, beers and appetizers. We started out with a simple salmon-avocado roll for $5 from the reverse happy hour menu, the salmon tasted like silky butter and made me question the quality of my usual sushi go to spot. Next we went for the tacos (4 for $7) - the cod, mushroom, chicken and beef - all were amazing (especially the mushroom, YAY for some great veggie options). Next, I had the Rollo Chingon (adobo grilled shrimp, guacamole, cilantro, jalape√±o, red lotus root chips + balsamic strawberry glaze) for $15. The Chingon was the only thing that I didn't LOVE but it was still good. Finally, my BF had the Tamarind Shrimp Wok (bamboo shoots, baby bok choy, dried shiitake mushrooms + garlic chips) for $14 which was very good.   The prices, overall, seemed very appropriate and I actually loved that the portion sizes where not too massive. The right portion sizes allowed us to order a greater variety and not inevitably overeat.   Service was very friendly and super fast. I can definitely recomend this place."}
{"text":"First visit on a Saturday night & this new spot has no problem packing a place! Beautiful decor. Started with a passion fruit cocktail which consisted of Mezcal tequila, passion fruit and ginger beer it was served in a stainless steel mug.  The presentation was not only beautiful but refreshing and delish. My patron margarita unfortunately was too sweet and my counterparts agreed.   We ordered quite a bit of sushi & it was all lovely. The nigiri needs some work but the rolls were very good, small & petite, the perfect bite.  The Korean steak tacos got an A+ from 2 of my dining companions.  Another standout is the green mojito. Wow! Tastes like  a coconut boozy milkshake. I would order it for dessert!   Our server was Chelsea and she was attentive, and was very good at her job.   I look forward to going back again and trying more of the menu as well as happy hour."}
{"text":"2nd time here.  Like bringing guests here and trying explain Mexican Asian fusion.  Also like the big tree growing from the ground on the inside of the restaurant.  Busy buzz interior with a hip and trendy feel. Tapas style and yet they also have big entrees.  I always order way too much every time.  Started woth coconut curry soup which is phenomenal and definitely has a kick to it.  Guacamole with pomegranite is fantastic. The bacon wrapped dates were a little too sweet instead of sweet and salty I think because the dates were too big and dominated.  The fried plantains were also very sweet and we probably shouldn't have ordered them as they didn't go with the meal but my girlfriend likes them.  Pad Thai was a miss so skip that but the foie gras and unagi roll was to die for.  Just melts in your mouth!  Kinchee fried rice is so good and that's coming from a Korean!  We ordered more rolls and all were good.  The dessert sampler for 40$ is a must. Beautiful presentation and delicious flavors."}
{"text":"First time at SumoMaya. My wife and I arrived at 5:30 PM for her birthday dinner, so we could catch the Symphony later.   We were seated in about ten minutes, even with a reservation and a half-full restaurant. We thought, based on reviews, that it was somewhat romantic. Not even.   We were seated in plastic garden chairs and brought water. Our server then took our drink order. As my iced tea was delivered, she took our food order: Ginger-fried rice to share; scallops for her and a spicy crab roll for me. Her wine arrived five mins after the food. Drinks after food?  My sushi roll was okay but nothing special. The scallops were a bit small for the price but again, okay. The ginger fried rice was good. My hesitation?  The side dish was the best item.   Service was very minimal and didn't stand out. Even the parking was weird: valet only but the cars were only parked 20 feet away. Was it to force tipping?  Not sure.   Big disappointment in SumoMaya."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a date night and decided to not come back...ever. It was insanely busy, understandable for a Saturday night, although it was the menu options, service, and noise level that turned us off. From the moment we stepped in we couldn't hear each other and the music didn't fit the Mexican and Asian mix. The vibe of the restaurant felt off. The service...terrible. We had so many different waiters that we didn't know who was ours and we were given the wrong food. After we finally notified someone after our supposed waiter was MIA, it took even longer to get our actual food. We have definitely had better Asian food, sushi, and Mexican cuisine. Glad we tried it to see what all the buzz was about!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this gem. Who knew Asian and Mexican could make such a happy union! We had the Hamachu Tiradito, Shushito roll, and the Maya roll...each was a work of art, and the flavor was delicious and unique. The cocktails are also very unique and creative. I recommend the Lemongrass, Jalepeno Monk, and  Sumo-Rita. Great quality, creative dishes, expert service, and zen ambience with a party on the side."}
{"text":"Came here for my brothers birthday on a recommendation from a friend. Boy was I glad we made reservations!   The decor and ambience of Semo Maya is fine modern and engaging. The tree in the center of the restaurant is an awesome idea. Great place to meet up anytime of the day.   Although all the drinks on the menu looked amazing, we only ordered two, and they definitely didn't disappoint. So yummy!   I was really confused when the waitress explaind the menu as \"tapas\" style. Definitely confusing because when she explaind it further it sounded more like and \"ala carte\" style, which is exactly what it was! And although confusing the service was so amazing. Totally accommodating and fun.   Every dish I tried was on point except the Pork al Pastor Pad Thai. I was expecting to have a hint of pineapple or a nod to the peanuts. Not the case. Although good, it had neither and left me feeling disappointed.   All in all the food was amazing, service nice and warm, and drinks well made. 4 stars for the entire expirence but not 5 because of the convoluted explanation of the menu and disappointment with the Pad Thai.   TLDR: Food amazing, explination of menu confusing, order many things you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I travel 40 plus weeks a year and in doing so enjoy seeking out restaurants for their food and atmosphere. With the in mind, Sumo-Maya is truly a standout.  From decor, to service to food... outstanding is the only word I can describe it.    I've been back multiple times and tried several dishes and never have I had anything to say other than wow!  And if there is a culinary god - on day 1 he/she created the Eggs Benedict with Short Rips. Life changing.    My compliments to Chef Matt and team.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Love the inside of this place. You're welcomed by a huge room that surrounds a massive tree in the center of the restaurant. If you choose to sit at the bar you can be seated where you can see the cooks which is an inviting appeal. Also they have a huge bar on the opposite side of the restaurant. I think the style of food is unique and delicious. Love the scene. It's a great place to get a group of friends to drink and eat."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! What a weird combination - Japanese/Asian and Mexican/Latin American. But it really does work. We tried a little bit of everything - sushi, noodles, tacos, cocktails and the only dish we didn't care for was the most expensive (of course) - the spicy crab noodles. Expected more/better flavor. They were just ok.  There is a dressed-up,  hipster atmosphere with live DJ on Friday and Saturday nights. Great people watching! Reservations recommended then but we were a party of two and able to walk in and be seated without a wait on Friday night."}
{"text":"Asian and Mexican cuisine collide at this trendy restaurant/bar in Scottsdale. The Kimchee Fried Rice bowl packed a powerful punch for my delicate tastebuds. Thank goodness the waiter kept the water flowing!  My husband enjoyed the Pork \"El Pastor\" taco complemented by Mexican Street corn.   The open floorplan makes it nearly impossible to converse with anyone. sushi bar is impressive."}
{"text":"I thought this place was OK. There drinks were mehh.... I got a margarita and they made it strong with orange juice, which I thought was odd.   WARNING FOOD PORTIONS ARE VERY VERY SMALL!!! I asked the server for something that was NOT spicy because I'm a wuss when it comes to hot food. She recommended 2 things that were incredibly spicy! My boyfriend loves spicy and he got the pad Thai and liked it okay, nothing great about it though. But he thought my food was MUCH spicier! I then ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, which was amazing. However, I only got 4 small chunks of meat on a kabob stick for $14. For that to be a normal entree I would've need like 3 kabob sticks = 12 bites = $42. The sea bass is the reason I'm rating this 3 stars, because that would be the only reason I would go back.   I feel this place strongly relies on the atmosphere to carry it. The decorations were very cool. There's even a tree in the middle of the restaurant. But the chairs were super hard! They clearly want to turn tables quickly."}
{"text":"Weekend bottomless brunch is a good idea, but the execution is not on par. The service is so slow, the concept is that you can order anything on the menu for $30. However, your wait staff disappears for such long periods that you're only able to order the bare minimum before giving up and asking for your check, which is then hand carved into stone before being brought to your table. Make sure you have hours before going here!!!"}
{"text":"I don't normally do this, in fact I've never done this but I'm that dissatisfied that I'm going there.  I enjoy going out and trying new restaurants.. who doesn't? SumoMaya in Scottsdale I had been to one other time besides this evening. The first time I thought things were a bit over priced and it was over all too loud to even enjoy the company you were with (If with a large group). Tonight I went back with only 1 other friend. I ate specifically before hand so that I could just enjoy the drinks and evening but not spend an arm and leg.   So my reasoning behind this post is I am extremely upset at the lack of customer service received. Being charged almost $20 per glass of wine I almost crapped my pants. I have never and would NEVER spend that much per glass. I am upset and dissatisfied because I had actually POINTED to the glass originally wanted, when receiving my bill and noticing the charge I let the waiter know what was wrong.  The waiter spoke to the bartender and I was told that since the glasses were already drank, there was nothing they could do. I was ALSO told that maybe if there was a miscommunication it could of been fixed. I'm sorry, but when I physically point out what I want and you bring me the most expensive kind you have..... how is that my fault?!!! Needless to say I will not be going back, their need to fix any unhappy customers and their wrong doings is zero to none. With the amount of money they pull in on a daily basis... my two glasses knocked down to the price I had thought, wouldn't even be a dent to them. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a good time, able to hear your company and not charged for the most expensive thing on the menu.  $50 for the glass of wine and edamame...... what a joke. I have never been so mad at a place I've been to for the lack of trying to fix a mistake!!!!"}
{"text":"The service was amazing; personable and authentic, not overbearing or fake. Food was good, not destination setting. So very overpriced. Almost like they think expensive means trendy. I like the concept of Japanese-Mexican fusion, but unrealistic in sustainable pricing. I'd go back if the price-point met the product."}
{"text":"Awesome stuff. Korean BBQ beef tacos prob the best of what we had. Sushi on par with better az sushi. Sat a sushi bar because it was packed, but full menu was available and service was great. Def worth a shot. Very creative menu good eats."}
{"text":"When you're excited to go to your regular spot for brunch, you always make a reservation in advance, you specifically ask for a booth within the reservation special requests and you show up and the Manager or host manager has an attitude when you don't want to sit at a table??!!!  Then she tells the nice young hostess to sit us at a booth outside BUT THEY NEED THE TABLE CLEARED BY 11am. Our reservation was at 9am. Seriously? We have to drive for an hour to get here, and you want to rush me on my Mother's Day brunch. WOW. Mind you, the food is always great but today there was no need for you to have an attitude and tell me, \"we have several large parties booked today\". So does that make it ok for my party of four to be treated below everyone else's requests??    I maintained my smile while they pushed two tables together by our booth. I made a point to say thank you to both. I'm not upsetting myself today!   THANK GOODNESS OUR SERVER HAS A SMILE ON HER FACE. JOANNAH WAS SO NICE.   THANKS FOR MAKING MY MOTHERS DAY BRUNCH BETTER AFTER THE RUDE START"}
{"text":"Check your bill! We were charged $70 for an $18 bottle of sake. In resolving the issue, manager Jason was aggressive and rude to us. This was surprising as we spent over $400 and we were celebrating a friend's birthday. Definitely did not end the night well. We will not go back. Low level of customer service for an upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is quite beautiful and eye-catching. Right away we were sat and greeted by the staff. The main dining room layout has an open kitchen, which can be entertaining but can be a downfall if you recognize your food sitting on the counter waiting to be served to your table. Happily, the service was exceptional!  About the food itself: We ordered sushi, the mussel bowl, the soft-shell crab BTL, and the tacos al pastor. Here's the thing-- the presentation is gorgeous. But the food is lacking where it counts the most. EVERYTHING WAS BLAND! Granted, the sushi was tasty and well priced. A $65 bill was unjustified, in my opinion. I've heard people rave about this place for months and I honestly cannot see why. Maybe it's because it is located in Scottsdale and the concept of a Japanese-Mexican fusion restaurant sounds new and exciting. When I heard people talking about it, I said, \"Oh! Like Chino Bandido?\" And the response I got was a snarky, \"No. This place is not ghetto.\" Well, maybe I'm more attuned to a lower-class lifestyle. I would have rather gone to Chino Bandido."}
{"text":"OMG, everything we ordered was beyond delicious. Started with the traditional guacamole and Calamari, moved on to the Suzuki roll and the crispy  pork belly roll and a side of the Mexican street corn. Enjoyed the new skinny margarita and everything was just on point! Please open a location in Dallas!"}
{"text":"Nice take on a Spanish Tapa's themed bar/restaurant where everything is smaller portions and you can try a lot of unique fare .  The kicker is they serve Mexican and Asian food which just seems to blend well!    It can get a little loud at night so if you are looking for a relaxing meal with great conversation this probably isn't the time to go."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place to eat with the \"fusion\" I have eaten here quite a few times now and have never been disappointed. The staff is super friendly and super young.  The staff is also very informative about the menu and also has awesome recommendations when prompted. Good job staff!!  The heater was burning my scalp but I probably could have moved seats but whatever lol. The food is prepared beautifully we had the calamari for the first time it was the \"bomb\". We also had sushi for the first time and it was good. We always order the pomegranate guacamole Bomb Diggety ! Always!  We shared the steak chimi churri and the sea bass. It was good. We also had and interesting pineapple weird dessert and it was good and tiny lol nice cocktail and wine menu o had my go to stag leap and we had another nice time at Sumomaya!"}
{"text":"This place is now a favorite for my wife and me. The food is delicious, and I can enjoy sushi while my wife eats her tacos. We would definitely recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"I went there for the bottomless brunch. I really like the Pomegranate Guacamole.  Muy caliente! The Machaca + Eggs 2 ways was outstanding.  The flavors really mesh well together.  I think we ordered 3 of the liquid cheesecakes. It was silky and rich but light.  I would definitely go back and explore the menu a bit more.  Tap water there is terrible but is kind of necessary when drinking cocktails. Bring a water bottle."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Great variety and decent flavors. Went downhill when I sucked a small hair ball through my straw from a margarita I ordered. And when I say a hair ball, I'm describing  a clump of hair that resembled a small group of hair that was pulled from a drain cover in your shower, just on a smaller scale. Waitress indicated that she was \"confused\" because no one tending bar had hair similar to that hair color.   Regardless,  manager was \"too busy\" to come by and acknowledge that there was even an issue. The kicker was I never wanted anything for free just a replacement drink, which took 20 minutes to receive, yet the waitress made a comment that made us feel like I planted the hair, and perhaps felt I was scheming for a free meal or something. Bottom line, I didn't want anything, but perhaps an apology from a manager on duty.  In any event, to suck a bunch of hair through a straw is simply disgusting, so we clearly will not be coming back to this restaurant, and I provide this review simply as a warning and precaution to others. I will file a complaint with the health department on Monday, and  if nothing else, hopefully create an inspection to make sure things are where they need to be overall. Maybe this was an isolated incident, or maybe it is something that could be expected in the future...nonetheless i was made to feel like someone looking for a handout, when all I wanted was a replacement. I don't typically leave reviews, but a manger on duty not having the decency to even acknowledge our issue,  makes it certain that a negative review is necessary. Take it or leave it, but after our experience I think this place needs a second thought from anyone thinking about frequenting this establishment."}
{"text":"There are some pros and some cons, although the cons really aren't that bad at all. My dish was excellent, I had the pork belly ramen and would definitely recommend it. Friend #1 had the Chinese Chicken Salad and said it was pretty bland (but he did say he'd come back and try something else). Friend #2 had the spicy crab roll and the salmon avocado roll, he said the were excellent. Odd thing, they'll only give you one free refill on your beverage, incredibly strange. I don't remember the last time I went somewhere and they charged you for refills.....especially because this is a moderately priced establishment, I don't think they'll be losing any money if they offered free refills....come on, this is 2014 after all. One last thing, our waiter. He was kind, prompt, and very helpful.....he just had an issue finding the door to the patio....let's just say the window won that battle! I will say, they were quick to clear his face print off of it though!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. The food is amazing and the drinks are great. Saturday and Sunday brunch is such a good deal. Also love the atmosphere and interior design!"}
{"text":"I love me some Mexican food and geez are these tacos some of the best ever!! Pls try all the tacos as each one has its own unique and blissful flavors (such an explosion in your mouth). Sushi is some of the best I've ever had always fresh and flavorful. Aaron the bartender is talented behind the stick making some kick ass Negroni's and is always hospitable (after our second time in already knew our names). My first time in was Monday and have already been back Tues, Thursday and Sat (might even be going tonight after the NFL games). Lol Keep up the good work SumoMaya!! Oh and let me mention that they have happy hour and reverse happy hour 9pm-Close! Dope spot will be going back again and again!!"}
{"text":"this is my first visit to the Scottsdale area and on our way in I saw the sign for a Mexican Asian restaurant!!! I pointed at it and my husband was like 'that looks interesting.  Let me say wow. We went to dinner with another couple and we ordered in the family style fashion  **my apologies for not taking photos!!**  Yes the prices are a bit shiny, but it's worth it. It's an experience worth having.   The small plates are actually small...big enough for 2 people, no more. The entree portions are definitely good for 3-4 people. And the kimchi fried rice is a MUST.  Be prepared to have a long experience so plan accordingly...that's the only negative. Waiting for the food."}
{"text":"Last night, I was in with a group for a goodbye to a European friend. Yes, groups can be tiresome for a server...But our server continually complained that it caused her extra work. In addition, while refilling my friend's water glass, the server stated, \"Maybe I should get you an additional glass!\" (Um, okay, your glasses are small and we live in the desert! Rude much?!) The food was okay, but not spectacular like the reviews stated. Perhaps the service tainted my taste buds."}
{"text":"Went to check out Cinco de Mayo specials that I read about on-line. $5 margaritas and happy hour prices all night!  I arrived at around 6:00pm and the place was packed! The hostess was helpful, we ended up grabbing a high top table within 5 mins. Instead of waiting 30 mins. for the sushi bar.  I ordered the house margarita, sesame ginger chicken taco, tempura cod taco, and chicharron de pollo. Everything came out VERY quickly and tasted super fresh. My uncle had the edamame and Salmon avocado handroll which he enjoyed.   Overall great service, decent portions, and flavorful food. Considering the crowd that was there, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"The best Asian and Mexican fusion! Absolutely delicious and a great and helpful staff with great recommendations. Fabulous ambiance. Dreaming about going back."}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience at this cool new fusion restaurant in Scottsdale.A group of us tried a lot from the menu including the fried rice, pad thai, sea bass pork belly..you get the idea. Every dish was served on a well presented plate and was equally delicious. Im picky about rice and their version was a nice mix of Mexican spice and Asian elegance. Every dish was cooked to perfection. The pork belly was a treat and the sea bass went really fast. If you're feeling decadent, and I often am when I'm out, try the billionaire roll. Way overpriced kobe beef roll that includes gold flake..Had to have it and it was stellar! Our server was busy but efficient and friendly. The patio was comfortable and had a nice selection of attractive Scottsdalites. Great new addition to the scene."}
{"text":"Very good food, but skimpy servings.  I would rather pay more and get a little more.  There is no indication on the menu how tiny the servings are. Order several things.  They bring items out when they're ready, so your guest can be waiting for food, while yours is getting cold sitting in fromt of you, this is not cool. Most kitchens know what table is ordering and will start the fast cooking order a little after the slower cooking one."}
{"text":"Quick one. Great place, beautiful decor and vibe. There were two of us for late dinner. Jessie was really cute and a great server. Eli, one of the management crew, came over to chat and was very kind.    This place is Asian fusion tapas. Probably a little less Mexican than they say. Innovate menu with smallish portions, but priced like it. Strong flavors ; they're not afraid to go sour.   I had a couple of very thoughtfully put together cocktails. There's a big drink menu and they have the mixology figured out."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was amazing, sushi was mediocre, rest of the entrees were excellent! The reason for the 2 stars was the \"used car sales man\" server. We were told the items were extremely small and we would \"at least need to order 4 items per person \". Well... Between the 2 regular 8 roll sushi, huge bowl of yummy rainbow ceviche, koren tacos, and seafood rice it was quite a lot for 2 people after being told \"it might be enough\". It was actually so much most of it got thrown out. The table next to us asked about the size of the tacos and I showed them ours since they had just arrived and the server immediately said \"they were abnormally large\". I understand wanting to get your ticket prices higher so you make more gratuity but this is just tacky"}
{"text":"Checked place out with my girl friend cause she saw that this restaurant was on the Food Network show.  The food is ok not the best either. All the dishes we had were sweet. I had the soft shell crab and it had a sweet mango sauce   It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. We ordered the California roll and that was disgusting. The crab smelled like it's been sitting out for days it had a really bad fishy smell to it. We also ordered some taco and the meat was again very sweet. We had return 2 entrees.  You have Caucasian people who own the this asian/Mexican restaurant and all the chefs/cooks are Caucasian or Latino. Don't expect good sushi if your chefs/cooks are not asians. Haha"}
{"text":"Met a large group of friends tonight for a new exploration of Mexican Asian fusion . Though we arrived early to what appeared an somewhat empty restaurant, it quickly filled with up. I would definitely recommended reservations. The parking lot seems a bit confusing at first with all the white cones placed, but recommend taking advantage of the free parking valets.   Since we had several friends to wait for we chose multitude of different appetizers throughout the night. The Mexican corn plates were delicious,  the calamari and shrimp plates quite tasty. The plates were very small and meant to be shared. So be prepared for the yummy tacos to be just a few bites lol. I chose pork tacos and a bowl of spicy creamy Thai coconut soup and was not disappointed. Definitely worth a second visit for the good food and eye candy ."}
{"text":"I had a much better experience for brunch then I did the first time I went to SumoMaya. Really great set up $30 a person plus $10 for bottomless drinks. Come hungry! Portions are still small for the entrees but the sides and apps make up for it. I loved the blood orange mimosa and the pomegranate guacamole!! Great improvements- music wasn't too loud this time, great service!!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, even if overpriced. The place looks cool and the service is good too. But the place is so noisy between the music and the crowd that it's impossible to have a conversation without yelling. Now, with ceviche and tiraditos on the menu, you'd expect pisco sour to be a staple. Not at all. The waitress didn't know and the bartender didn't have the ingredients. Not sure that it is worth a second visit."}
{"text":"Why should an individual who cannot sit comfortably at a bar seat or a high top not be able to enjoy Happy Hour ...80$ later???  Cuisine excellent as usual...however the great vibe was instantly killed at 4:30 PM when we asked the hostess to seat us at a typical  table.  My friend who is 68 and overweight/obese/ or whatever term you choose to describe was strictly informed  high tops for HH.  We respectfully abided by SumoMaya's discrimination rules.   Once seated at the basic table,  I visited the \"empathetic\"hostess and asked for the HH menu and to speak to the manager. She reinstated that it was not allowed.  I asked, what would you do if she was in a wheel chair and she chimed back, that would be different!   The  manager eagerly greeted our table and bluntly asked, \" What is the problem?\"  As discretely as possible I politely asked, Could you please honor HH at our typical table?   He elaborated  he would make an exception only once. No worries we will not be back."}
{"text":"I was really skeptical of the Asian-Mexican mix but it was recommended by some locals so I figured I'd give it a shot. Shockingly the mix wasn't that odd, some dishes infused both types of cuisine, some were just one or the other. That said, it kinda worked. Even so the food was average. I'm from Seattle so it'll take a lot to impress me with sushi, I got the tempura roll recommended by our waitress, the shrimp tempura came on top the roll and was a baby shrimp, not my fave. We got some steak dish as well, which was well prepared but tasted too salty.   The service was great. We sat at the sushi bar and watched the chefs making food and fresh guacamole in the open kitchen. Our waitress was sweet and very attentive. Cool vibe inside, funky and fun, huge screens for watching games. Nice open space."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous with a hip, trendy ambience.  Service is spot on, our server was really good.  But, alas, the food....bland, boring, just not good.  It should be exciting and wonderful, Asian/Mexican fusion....dreaming of sweet and spicy, but instead just sweet.  So much fruit, not enough spice.  This place really needs to work on their food, I was extremely disappointed and underwhelmed."}
{"text":"This place is beyond terrible, from the staff, to the decor followed by the service! I was pregnant at the time so I needed a slight modification to each dish (basically no goats cheese) and EVERY dish came out wrong, followed by the chef sending something else special which I also couldn't have. The only thing I enjoyed was the shrimp fish but it had a wax paper in it... We asked the manager about it and he said it was necessary because of the oils... Umm tacky and not necessary. Find a different way to plate it. Some of the sides were cold. I hated how the salsa on the menu was just salsa to add to your dish? 5$ no chips? Server had no idea what he was doing! I mean no idea... He had previously been a banquet server so didn't turkey understand service. Lastly, I hate that everyone thinks this place is so great. It is a lot of money put into a typical Scottsdale restaurant with a mediocre menu and no real charm. I came on opening week ... Yes a long time ago, but never wrote my review. So here it is."}
{"text":"Was ok. Went with a friend who was visiting. The meals are more like tapas, small entrees that you can share.  So you have to be careful cause it gets expensive fast.  The valet was a nice touch.    Was loud in the restaurant area as they had a large bar crowd of 20 something Dudebros and Tiffanies and music playing. Hard to hear any conversation and my voice was tired at the end of the night.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Our bachlorette party was so excited to try to \"all you can eat and drink\" brunch at SumoMaya.  It came highly recommended by other Torontonians who had vacationed in AZ.  The entire experience was a let down but the restaurant did try to mitigate the situation and concept is \"fun\" so some stars for that.  The \"all you can eat\" option is $29pp and includes unlimited sides and appetizers for the table served family style.  For an additional $10pp you can add unlimited drinks, the caveat being you need to choose between mimosa, Bloody Mary and margs but of course if you are a bigger group you can trade drinks during refills.  The concept is \"fun\" especially for a bachlorette when the focus resolves around eating and drinking and getting your money's worth!  Our group was seated in the back part of the restaurant by panels of windows with extremely poor air circulation and no evidence of A/C.  The entire restaurant was not cool by any means but walking from our table area to the washroom, we could feel a difference.  Especially coming to AZ from Toronto, our group was not accustomed to 100 F temperatures.  We asked politely if there was another table on several occasions and was told this was the only long table available.  I appreciate we were a big group and the restaurant was packed but the waitress was not prompt with refilling water glasses which is a recipe for dehydration and illness when the group was drinking and extremely overheated due to restaurant's poor A/C and air circulation.  On to the food ... nothing was bad nothing was spectacular other than the appetizer guac.  I think the food quality is somewhat compromised in the \"all you can eat\" style.  Everyone devoured the appetizers.  A lot of the entrees were packed up or wasted as we had already eaten so many apps.  The general feeling from the group was that the apps were much better than the entrees.  I appreciate this could also be due to the fact that most of us were so full by the time the entrees came.  They had a round of bachlorette desserts, most of which were brought home.  At the end of the meal, about half the table was extremely dehydrated and we voiced our concern to the manager about the fact that water glasses were left empty for much of the meal and that the table was in such a hot area of the restaurant.  They agreed to comp the $10 drinking fee on each bill, which was greatly appreciated.  While our waitress was pretty good at handling a large group (other than failing to fill up waters fast), the front door staff were rude.  When we asked to speak to a manager, they were giggling, which was unprofessional and disrespectful.  If groups are going to be seated in such a hot area, they should at least leave water pitchers on the table."}
{"text":"Had amazing dinner!!! Our server was fantastic, definitely ask to sit in Jennifer Sigel ' s section!"}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant with great indoor and outdoor space!  We came in for Sunday brunch several weeks ago and were really surprised it wasn't busier.  We tried the buttermilk pancakes and the enchiladas suizas...both were pretty darn good.  The atmosphere is living and fun, the service is great and the menu is really unique with many different choices depending on what you are in the mood for."}
{"text":"Phenomenal Food at Sumo Mayo.  What more can you ask for a restaurant where you can actually eat and hang out after!!! Food is amazing and creative.  Presentation on point and the drinks are fire !!!"}
{"text":"This place is hot! Hot in so many ways! The menu, the vibe, the people!  A group of 10 of us came here as a dinner club event that we had last week. It may go down as one of my new favorite places in the valley. The atmosphere is hip, trendy, and cool. Music pumps through a pretty awesome sound system and the food and drink menu are not the norm.  Cool orangey- Mayan- hot pink decor adorn the place. And the slider doors everywhere give the place an 'outside being in feel'. A tree in the center give that feel too!  I love a place like that!  This is not your parents Mexican, err, Asian eatery! In fact, my parents would either hate it or love it! But I was beyond impressed.  We all started at the very crowded Sumo Maya on a night that had a ton of Ferrari's in the parking lot. The valet guy said there was an event that night and the place was full! As was the valet; as was the parking lot!  My boyfriend loved the place for the 'eye candy' Ferrari's alone in the lot! Once I was able to pry his eyes back to me and into the restaurant,we bellied up to the bar to wait for the rest of our group and reservation time.   The drinks are like the menu: different. The drink menu is vast and there are lots of cool mixology drinks to choose from , or the usual beers, sakes and wines. I started with a \"Coconut\", made up of pearl coconut vodka, ginger-lemongrass, a little lime and coconut water. I admit, I don't like 'sweet' concoctions, so I was a little worried I was ordering out of my comfort zone. I was pleasantly surprised when the Coconut arrived in a cute, little champagne glass. I believe the coconut water and lime cut what would be sweet. I had two of these and don't let the small glass fool you: perfect and 'hidden' strong!  We were seated promptly at our reservation time. Despite how busy they were! There was not an open table or bar stool in the place. I am very glad we had a reservation! My boyfriend and I ordered the fresh made guacamole with lump crab as an appetizer. I love a great guacamole. This was off the charts, amaze-balls. Tons of fresh lump crab pieces adorned the top of this delectable bowl of perfect guac. It is served with flat tortillas that are 'street taco' size. We also ordered the Rollo Chingon sushi roll; I guess we could not decide on one thing we wanted to start with on this menu! Who doesn't love great sushi with a spin? The Rollo Chingon is a roll of grilled shrimp, fresh guacamole, a spice of jalepeno, housed on a sweet strawberry glaze and 'fried' red lotus root atop. Again, this 'starter' was an ample serving for two. I could have made dinner out of this one roll. But, I am a foodie and I like to sample many things!  For dinner I ordered the Chinese Chile Crab Garlic Noodles. This dish was ramen noodles with shiitake mushrooms and just enough green onions and a hint of miso to offset the flavors.To me, it had a 'pad thai' texture to it, which I loved.  Beware, this dish had a kick to it! The lump crab on top once again, happily surprised me. The concept of SumoMaya is 'small plates' , but honestly, I had enough of this dish for lunch the next day. Yes. It could have been that we could not decide and ordered a few things! My boyfriends entree was the Pork Belly Ramen. Rice sauteed with shiitake mushrooms, pea leaves, adorned with tender pork belly and adorned with a perfect poached egg and scallions. He had paired that with a Skinny Margarita, again strong!.. from the bar. Since we share most of our meals, I liked this dish, as well, BUT, I loved mine more! The dessert menu sounded awesome, but we passed on that. Too many meals out lately and too many dishes here at Sumo made us feel like fat kids, already!  I will admit I see where Sumo can work on a few things. For example, our dishes came out 'sporadically'. One couple in our group was getting their apps while some were on to their entrees. The water glasses ran empty a few times. This food has spice! Those glasses need to stay full! The parking lot was entirely full. The valet, too. First world problems of having to walk a block from parking up the way to Sumo. AND the restroom is tiny. That said. I loved this place and am already planning a Sunday Funday here with the advertised bottomless Bloody Mary's, Mimosas and Micheladas for $15 coupled with brunch and live music! Football is here and this would be a great place to have brunch and drinks on a Sunday. Welcome to the valley, Sumo! Despite the few little quirks, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and three tacos for five dollars! Best meal I've ever had for five dollars in my life! Going back soon!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here for brunch..  It was definitely a treat..  All the food was amazing and so was our server! Candice went above and beyond to make our experience a memorable one... we will be coming back again soon."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Love the environment. Great ambiance. My second time and while there was a 2 hour wait for a regular table, we were lucky enough to get a spot at the bar. My friend and I ordered two rolls and noticed after awhile that our second roll did not come and it had been quite some time. We later were told by the bartenders that the kitchen had mistakenly didn't make our other roll and were doing it at the moment. They were very apologetic and gave us the roll free. Excellent customer service and we were completely satisfied. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group for my friends b day. Decor was really nice, their alcohol drinks were good and our waitress was really nice. They have horrible options for vegetarians though. The waitress did the best she could to help me find something to eat on the menu but when it came out the soup had fish in it. It was like milky top roman and so gross I couldn't finish it. We also got the fried rice as a side lets just say it was not worth $12. I've had better at hole in the wall Chinese restaurants. I won't ever be going back to this place"}
{"text":"Fusion you say? Of two of the most delicious types of foods known to man? Okay, I'll admit I've been here quite a few times, and love their magic mojitos, and ahi tuna pizza.... And also their guac with pomegranate or cranberries, whatever the hell it is, it's tasty. Their tacos are also killer. Super colorful and vibrant with good service!"}
{"text":"Service very slow.  We watched everyone around us get our food and we sat and waited.  Once it came we we wholly unimpressed.  We both had 3 taco+veggie plate and each got three diff tacos.  The mushroom taco was mushy and weird and the Korean taco lacked flavor.   The rest were only ok.  The only great thing was the Mexican corn but I found two hard unpopped corn kernels in it and almost broke my tooth.  We told the waiter and he didn't even acknowledge the complaint.  Three stars ONLY for the ambiance of the place.  Gorgeous."}
{"text":"If u come here get the pomegranate guacamole...oh myyyy it is sooooo good.  And the mushroom tacos ate AWESOME!!! Love the ambiance and the funny pics on the chairs.  Very scottsdale.  If thats ur thang..."}
{"text":"I love the fusion of Mexican/Asian food in this place - like getting a little bit of this and a little bit of that, most interesting. I definitely would return to try more dishes. The calamari was amazing, nothing like I've ever had before, sweet and sour and tasty and the presentation was delectable. Everyone loved their food and was happy with what they ordered.  Service was timely, the server was friendly, imported wines were affordable.  Only negative was the music, a bit too loud and people were talking above it..."}
{"text":"Fun decor with good food and fast service! The Crispy Chicken Mole was delicious. I would have licked the plate! Must get the rice to soak it all up."}
{"text":"SumoMaya is one of my favorite restaurants. The foods amazing and the wait staff took very good care of us. However we had reservations set for 8:15 Saturday night and did not get seated till 9! I understand we were a large party but the wait was a little ridiculous. And we made the reservations with a weeks time because we are from out of town. Had we got in on time I would have given 5 stars."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was awesome. Good music, great ambiance, very suitable for a mid/late twenties crowd. The best part of our experience was our amazing server, Mike. Not only was he awesome, the rest of the staff was very friendly and kept busy. I used to be a server and I really appreciate seeing staffs all working hard and supporting each other. Great vibes."}
{"text":"Best kept secret brunch in Scottsdale! Awesome eats and libations...all part of the brunch"}
{"text":"Loved the food. Being a chickenitarian I would like more options as I don't eat red meat or most fishes. But they do have some vegan options. I am also gluten intolerant so that makes it more tough. But compared to many other places I had more stuff to eat here. Very posh and elite ambience. We sat outside and enjoyed. It was pretty full for a weekday 9:30pm. It's open till 11 pm which is amazing!"}
{"text":"Start to finish everything was done right. We were seated quickly. The dining room was busy but they were well staffed. Our server was enthusiastic and knowledgeable. We order 5 dishes and none were disappointing. Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  We tried the pomegranate guacamole, pad Thai, sea bass and ahi tuna taco's. The pad Thai was good but very sweet. Too sweet for my liking. The ahi tacos were good but nothing special. The guac was quite good according to others in my party.  I was unable to eat it.  In the menu it states dried fruit added... This included kiwi and I'm allergic.  And lastly the sea bass.... Very sweet glaze on it...too sweet again.  Also it was terribly fishy.  Unfortunately sumo...I don't think we will be returning. Service was excellent, presentation of food was excellent and establishment was very clean."}
{"text":"First before you get to judging my 3/5 stars here me out  Came for a lil birthday breakfast with a friend, first time inside amazing place and atmosphere and I love the openness and how comfy it all was. Our server seemed to be a lil impatient with us explaining how the \"bottomless brunch\" worked so I was hesitant to keep asking for help on the menu but none the less she got the orders correct.   Food was actually really good and fresh to the order, I get it's all you can eat but the servings were made for IG size and not consumption. All the courses were good and had vegan options so I was good with that. Would I come back? Probably not just due to other options in the valley. But the experience and concepts was dope."}
{"text":"I just can't get in to this place. The atmosphere isn't great and the food is just okay. The concept is a little funky for my taste. I'll take a pass at this place in the future, just not my vibe."}
{"text":"Bottomless brunch rocked our socks. Our server, Erica, was great! We had 7 people in our group and she did a great job ordering our apps and sides and spacing them all out. She also had great recommendations. The sushi was great and the liquid cheesecake was to die for."}
{"text":"Eating at SumoMaya was overall a big disappointment last evening as it was our first time.  Service was the most challenging part of this evening and I learned from Eli the manager that they work in teams.  This was quite puzzling since we had one waitress and only one bus boy who delivered water once.  After all of the appetizers were eaten and cleared, it took over 30 minutes to deliver the main dishes and our waitress did not even know they had not been delivered. This system and the main dishes not being as good as the appetizers is why I think it is not worth the noise level, service incompetency and price."}
{"text":"Went today for the first time and I was extremely happy with everything we ordered. Service was great along with the amazing food. We started off with the street corn, so delicious I was extremely happy with the portion size as well. For our entrees we got pad Thai, one of the best I've had so goood. Sushi wise I got the rock shrimp roll and real California roll and eel avocado. It was good but the entree were the best. I will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Sumomaya is perfect place for date night for younger people. They have open kitchen area and huge tree in the middle along with big screen tvs. I don't know what kind of sauce they put in calamari but it was yum. Probably one of the best Calamari I have tasted in a while. You also got to also try their Pomegranate Guac which is out of this world flavor. We also had some sushi rolls, tacos al pastor and Ceviche was the bomb. Good times were had and we will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"A little nouveau riche and ostentatious for my taste. Ok sushi. Service staff is very accommodating and pleasant."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience; food was good, but service was less than stellar, which ruined the entire experience. Waiter offered celebratory shots/cake for our party, and proceeded to charge for these items that he offered (but were not requested). Waiter was apologetic, which was appreciated by our party; however, manager's reaction was completely inappropriate -- accusatory, unapologetic, and rude. As we exited, waiter who did not serve our party made a rude comment, as well. All in all, a disappointing experience...the food was good, but I wouldn't support this restaurant again, as there are comparable options nearby."}
{"text":"The food is good, the vibe is great, service great. He prices are a bit high. Last time we were at Sumo the guacamole was outstanding, this time it was average. We were really excited for it. See pic for idea of costs and charge for ice.  I wouldn't recommend this place for seniors who aren't open minded with food. It was difficult for them to find something. The margaritas are rockin.  We had jack on rocks and surprised to find out they charge $2 for (rocks) which was plain old ice. That was a bummer."}
{"text":"Mexican/Asian fusion. I honestly didn't know how that would work. But, SumoMaya made it WORK.   Our party was vegetarian and we ordered almost every veggie item on the menu and it did not disappoint. The chef also made us veggie tacos which were delicious.  The mexican corn was absolutely incredible and I loved the guacamole with the large tortilla chips. Cocktails were also delicious - I had the golden triangle and it was refreshing with a hint of spice.  Will most definitely be back and tell everyone I know about it."}
{"text":"Solid 4 Star Restaurant! Very cool and hip venue with clientele to match. A few so so drinks with Patron On--Tap followed by an awesome selection of sushi and various Latin themed entrees. Overall a great experience that would have been 5 Star if the waiter didn't oversell Wagu Nigiri that ended up costing $33 for 3 small pieces."}
{"text":"Excellent  place for food and drinks.  Love the mix and the options available.   Tacos were perfect, guacamole was great and pad Thai  was amazing.  Atmosphere  was energetic,  but not loud. Love the open space and layout."}
{"text":"#OBSESSED!!!!   There is nothing better than amazing Mexican food and amazing Japanese food and this place has both!!!!!   Their pomegranate seed guac is OUT OF THIS WORLD. I would have it with every meal if I could. The atmosphere of this place is great - there's a freaking tree in the middle of the restaurant, a fantastic bar, and amazing patio seating. I love the mis-matched chairs and plate settings (I always try to sit in the gold throne).   If you need a new brunch spot, this is it. Don't miss the guac, sushi, or tacos, or eggs benny. Honestly everything here is good. 11/10 recommend. I would get married here like I love it so much"}
{"text":"Attempted to have dinner there - even had a reservation.  But when my first sight upon entering was hostess flanked by a DJ and she had to lean in toward me just so I could say my name right into her ear, I quickly realized this \"restaurant\" is more of a club on a Saturday night.   We were told our table would be ready in 5 minutes. To the bar we went, fighting the crowd to be able to order an overpriced glass of wine - the brand of which is permanently on the bottom shelf of the wine department of Walmart - if you were wondering about the quality.  We were in a sea of 40 and 50 somethings who were so plastered that I know their children would be embarrassed and mortified to see them. It was very much the norm and very pathetic. After waiting 30+ minutes, with a headache mounting from the thumping bass, we bailed and opted for the Italian place right next door.  The drunk soccer moms in stilettos on the sidewalk out front showing us their version of sumo wrestling was a fitting last impression."}
{"text":"We have driven by this place a million times and finally decided to stop in.  Food was EXCELLENT.  We had the El Pastor and Korean Beef Tacos.  Both better than expected.  We also had the Pomegranate Guacamole and Rollo Chingon rolls.  Again, super good.  Finally, we had the best Waitress - Brittany.  Super attentive and knew the menu inside and out. Great personality and awesome drink recommendations.  Compliments to the DJ as well, she was great. If your looking for an upbeat attractive crowd with a diverse menu, this is your spot. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of my fav restaurants. I love the vibe here. It is definitely a great spot to hang out with friends or bring out of town guests to. The food is always delicious. I have not been disappointed. Everything on the menu was spot on. I especially love their sizzling rice, ramen, miso eggplants and sushi. Sooooo yummy. Ooh, the guacamole is exceptional. I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"What a great place! I wasn't sure if I was going to like a Mexican-Asian fusion restaurant. I was skeptical. I'm happy to report I was pleasantly surprised! My friends told me that it's kind of like a tapas (small plate) menu, so we ordered a bunch of stuff & shared. First out was the \"bacon guacamole\" which was tasty. Next out was \"tempura unagi roll\" which was good as well. It reminded me a lot of a Las Vegas roll. We also had the \"crispy pork belly roll\" which was different. It was pretty good, but I don't normally like pork belly. My friends really liked it though. I also ordered the \"Lobster & Crab Dynamite\" which was delicious. For a drink I ordered the skinny margarita which was awesome. This is definitely a busy, \"where the cool people hang out\" type place & I can't wait to try more things off the menu."}
{"text":"Interesting concept but it works! The edamame is a must get- the flavor is out of this world. The service was great also."}
{"text":"We had dinner on Friday night and were promptly greeted by the upbeat smiling host staff. Brittany sat us right away and was very professional and friendly. I don't remember our servers name but she was very attentive and knew the menu well and was also very nice. We ordered drinks that were amazing. I highly recommend trying the Magic Mojito. So yummy and try it even if you don't typically like mojitos. Our food was also outstanding. We had a sushi roll a shrimp appetizer and the carne asada tacos. Carne had a bit too much of the grill char taste for me but was still really good and a cool presentation. The manager Jason stopped by to check on us and I always appreciate that. This was our second visit to Sumomaya and certainly won't be our last."}
{"text":"Had an incredible experience at Sumomaya. Firstly, I loved the decor and the service was amazing. My waiter recommended some awesome dishes and was extremely attentive.  We started with the pomegranate guac, which was so tasty! I have never had pomegranates in guacamole before, but it was so tasty. We also ordered the crispy rock shrimp and the white fish ceviche. The rock shrimp was good but nothing too special (I have had very similar dishes at other restaurants). However the white fish ceviche was amazing. We did one sushi roll, the Suzuki roll. I really liked the texture of the roll. Finally we shared the mahi mahi tacos and the ginger fried rice. We also had a side of the broccolini. The ginger fried rice was my favorite thing, it was so tasty. Would absolutely recommend.   All in all it was a wonderful meal. We had three total people and shared these 6 dishes + 1 side and it was the perfect amount of food. I was very full and very happy after the meal. Had the mochi for dessert, loved it"}
{"text":"The setting here is Perfect! The food is sooo delicious! I love the valet parking and highly recommend going!"}
{"text":"This is a very unique restaurant with a creative and impressive menu. They have a somewhat good vegetarian menu. Their sushi is really fresh and different. The mix of Chinese and Mexican makes Suma Maya worth a try."}
{"text":"Came for Saturday brunch special... 1st course probably better than 2nd since you can have sushi...granola was great and so were black beans and rice... only change I would make is not to have pineapple in rice which is bit like pineapple pizza (either you hate it or hate it)... 2nd course smoked salmon omelette was nice minus the sauce which does not add anything to dish other than calories...had early grey tea but they brought lemon with that which meant nobody else orders it... lemon are great with herbal teas and black teas usually have milk or creams like coffee..place was busy and they had live music playing ... which is nice but was too loud to talk with anyone on your table...and after the first course came had to wait for milk and cutlery to be brought out... looks like they did not setup tables after first group leaves... cold tea is usually not good.. 3 stars for food and minus 2 for service or lack there of."}
{"text":"I don't get what the fuss is about.  I would call myself a foodie.  I have ate here a handful of times and only liked it once.  I have ordered a variety of things and nothing really worked well in my opinion.  I am not picky but, have a very defined palate."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night with my husband on date night.  Great meal and great fun.  Yes, it is loud but it had a great energy going and we could hear each other and the waitress.  The menu can be a bit confusing but just ask for suggestions.  We started off with the night's special ceviche which was dorado and it was amazing.  Best ceviche ever.  Small portions but that allowed us to sample many different dishes.  Another surprise dish was the miso, sugarcane sea bass.  So many great flavors in one dish.  We had the Maya roll and again that was quite tasty.  Loved the Summer Corn as well.  The popped corn gives it great texture.  Guacamole with crab was good but next time I may pass on that to save room for other dishes.  My Green Tea cocktail was refreshing and not too strong.  We had 2 desserts, the tres leche  cake and a fruit crisp with ice cream,  both very good.  We had attentive service and did not feel rushed.  As this is a tapas style place, we enjoyed ordering as we went along.  It is a little more costly but well worth the quality of food.  Can't wait to go back with friends"}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in you're transformed to a different world! Try the Korean beef and fish tacos. We also tried the spicy tuna roll and spicy yellowtail roll! We also tried the crispy calamari. We loved our food. The cocktails were awesome too. Patron margarita and skinny girl were fabulous!"}
{"text":"Very good ambiance and setup.  Trendy and uptempo. The place is roomy but it is loud.  Not a bad thing, but expect it.  Creative choices for both guacamole and ceviche.   Had the crab guac, Korean beef tacos, crab/seafood udon and shared all with mi Novia.  Also had some great saki. Ignore the pricing and have a great time. The experience and taste is very good.   Review Update:  OK, I am writing from my cell and took a few days to write this and relax a bit.  First, the food was fantastic and the server Kirsten was great. Perfect.  I downgraded a star, probably can chalk it up to annoyance, right or wrong.  See, I have been there like five or six times, so I have a sense for the place.  Planning to go with my Novia, so at like 9am I make a res for 630pm on Open Table.  I ask for a fourtop in the Open Table request box.  I understand. No guarantees, but I pick an early hour and get the reservation in early. The reasons for the request are, if you have been here, one thing we wanted to do is order a bunch all at once and graze.  Order the guacamole and ceviche and a couple of plates of tacos all at once and spread out.  As we know the portions are small but tasty.  Mainly, the request allows us to sit next to each other.  We get there. Taken to a two top.  Sit across from each other and have the dishes come out (quickly) but only room for some at a time. We explained and requested but no bueno for us. Frustrating thing was one table over was a four top with two people at it, and it just stayed two.  As many of you are, money is not the issue on a weekend at a place like this.  I end up spending a ton for good food anyway.  Like many of you, me and my better half probably spend a grand a month at great places here.  Just kinda bummed with the above.  I will upload a guerilla pic of the four top next to us...  Kirsten should get a raise though.  She was fantastic."}
{"text":"Upon walking in you can't help notice the tree centered in the restaurant, I love the look and vibe of this place.  My friend and I started with some drinks, we got the Sumo-Rita and the Loaded Mule. My loaded mule was pretty good, the flavor profile of cucumber with passionfruit, seemed like a really good twist on typical Moscow Mule. Don't get me wrong, it was good but it just didn't really wow me as much as I had hoped. The Sumo-Rita was really refreshing and light, it was so good!   For food we got the crab guacamole, shishito roll, rock shrimp tempura roll, coconut ahi tuna tartar and the pork belly ramen. It probably seems like a lot of food but the portions are somewhat on the small side and we really wanted to try a variety of things.   The Shishito roll was really average, and although the the ingredients seem really unique it sort of just over complicates things. You'd think a roll with shishito peppers, kiwi-mango sauce, avocado and salmon would be really complex but all you end up tasting is a slight bitterness from the peppers and mango.  The rock shrimp tempura roll was somewhat like your normal shrimp tempura roll but dressed up a bit. Not bad by any means but I'd try other items if I ever came back. The crab guac was okay but it was kinda bland. The crab was just put on top and seemed like an afterthought.   The coconut tuna tartar was pretty good, the coconut wasn't over powering, super crispy plantain chip and bonus points because the presentation was gorgeous. The pork belly ramen was unexpectedly my favorite dish I tried that night. The pork belly was super tender while the broth was really deep with pork and mushroom flavor.   Overall the SumoMaya was pretty good. Although some of the food we got was average there were so many items on the menu that seems interesting I'd probably come back to try new things."}
{"text":"This should only be a one-star shop, but for the fast and friendly greeters who sat us down right away. EVERYTHING after that went the opposite of good. The servings are mostly symbolic, we brought an appetite and left hungry. The battered cod tacos were tiny enough to be called taquitos with something resembling a fish stick in the center. I also had some unagi sushi and this unagi was poorly prepared. The waitress took the time to deride us at the end of our meal, mentioning that we should probably have ordered some sandwiches instead. The price tag was unreal, I felt ashamed for inviting a good friend along because he thought he's paying for the entire bill even though we went dutch. Pricey, tiny portions, lackluster service. Overall, I wish I never went there, period!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. I hate that I only come here once a year but that's what makes it so special. My fianc√© and I come here Every year for the last 3 years the day before Valentine's Day. We haven't had one thing on the menu that we disliked! This place is unique with its exotic flavors! I have about 300 and something days before I get to come again but I'm looking forward to it! This time we tried the pomegranate guacamole, the Korean tacos, the sushi that has apple and salmon, and the crab noodles. Everything was just delicious. We also ordered a few drinks and those also did not disappoint. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try this place for happy hour on a Friday as we had heard good things about the food.   We arrived at 5 pm and noticed it wasn't very busy. We quickly found out that happy hour is only served at the bar or high top tables, and if we couldn't find a spot we would have to be seated at a regular table and be served from the dinner menu.   We walked around a bit and noticed almost all the happy hour designated areas were full, with the exception of the sushi bar. Feeling unsure if the sushi bar was really a happy hour spot, we stood around until one of the hostesses came by and asked to seat us again. She seemed rather inconvenienced for having to speak to us despite the fact that the restaurant was 75% empty.   We said we would be seated and she grabbed some menus and sat us outside on the patio, even though it was really hot and the inside had many open tables.   At this point we were both feeling unwelcome and uncomfortable, and we took a look at the menu. Though our server seemed to be a little friendlier, we were no longer excited to try the food, nor were we hungry. We didn't want to dine in a place that felt a bit too pretentious. We decided to leave before ordering anything.   Although the restaurant had a unique vibe and decor and we heard the food was good, we left feeling that it's not our scene, a bit too posh and trendy for a relaxed happy hour to kickoff the weekend. I'm sure it's a great fit for others, but I won't be trying it again.   Also the only parking available is complimentary valet, which is never really \"complimentary.\""}
{"text":"My daughter wanted to go to SumoMaya for her birthday over the Christmas Holiday in December 2014. My wife also checked some reviews and they were all positive; as this one is. Our experience was excellent from the moment we stepped into the restaurant, to the server to the food. As this was our first visit, the server was very helpful providing  insight into the different dishes. If you go in a group, I would advice that everyone order something different as everything the menu is wonderful. We really enjoyed the whole experience.  Please note, the only reason I give SumoMaya four instead of a five is for me, it was a little pricey. For a special occasion, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night. Our second visit (1st was just a drink at the bar to check it out) Food exceeded all expectations.  My wife and I shared the ahi tacos as an appetizer.  I had the \"el pastor\" pad Thai for dinner and she had the grilled shrimp... we shared. I was concerned the el pastor with tamerind would be too sweet, but it was fantastic.  Service was perfect, fun vibe. New place to swing into when we are in that area."}
{"text":"I would love to give this place a better review, however I only feel right giving it 3 stars. Though the food was delicious, depending on what you order, portions can be a little on the small side (and yes, I do realize that some of the plates are small plates, yet the small plates were even a bit too small). Also, it's obvious that the wait staff caters to the \"beautiful\" people who flash their money and are there to be seen. For those of us who have lived in the Scottsdale area for a long time, you know how that mentality of people ruins it for the rest of us who don't fall under the \"Snottsdale\" moniker, and it's unfortunate that the snobby crowd gets the faster service and syrupy sweet attitude. I would hope to return another time for more tasty food in a bit more generous portions and hopefully some better attention from the wait staff."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome experience! Came here  while staying at the Hilton across the street. Caught happy hour on Friday night and had a great drink (the lemongrass) and guacamole. Stuck around for dinner and had the Pad Thai and enjoyed it a lot! Fun, lively environment - especially for a Monday night.  Enjoyed our first nights experience that we came back with a large group the next day for dinner. The bartender recognized us and hooked us up with drinks. I ordered the ramen. Pork belly was perfect and serving was generous.   I recommend to anyone staying at the Hilton in town for business. Way better than hotel food!"}
{"text":"For the ambiance and hip factor, SumoMaya is 5 stars (trendy, fashionable dressers, good looking lively crowd), but the 2 food dishes I ordered were absolutely terrible. The service by the bartenders was friendly and quick and overall I had a fun experience hanging out here. But the ahi tuna tacos and sushi roll I ordered were just plain mediocre at best and the food taste was underwhelming."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, insist love the atmosphere and the flavor of this restaurant. It has multiple tastes because it's a fusion between Asian and Mexican! I just love it so much!"}
{"text":"I tried the food offered this evening at hotel thrillest...all I can say is flavorful and refreshing!! Salmon tartare and a wonderful  guacamole dip simple and elegant yet packed with flavor...would definitely dine in!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and everything on the menu is unique and amazing!! Service is hit and miss sadly. I've had great service all the times I've dined here, except for last time. I'm going to assume maybe it was an off day and still give them 5 stars since it was always great the previous times. Worth checking out, even if it's just for a before/after cocktail!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was absolutely amazing. My friends and I came for Galentines Day and it was so much fun. You feel like you are out clubbing but you are at dinner so you get that going out fix. Great date now and pre going out dinner. Can't wait to try the happy hour the tacos are so flavorful and yummy"}
{"text":"Brittany was the best server. She was so fun and accommodating for our group at brunch. Brought us everything we needed on bottomless. Great atmosphere and live music"}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is lacking. Atmosphere is Iffy. Once I was there it was nice Second time the music was blaring so loudly I couldn't hear someone sitting right next to me."}
{"text":"One Word.....AMAZING!!!  Phenomenal food, amazing service, wonderful ambiance!! A HUGE shout out to our server Reina!  She is amazing.    The only complaint I had was the butt heads next to our table, but that is not the fault of the restaurant.  As a matter of fact, they moved us and let us keep our AMAZING server.  This may be my new, favorite place!"}
{"text":"I think there's two different sides to this place.  The Happy Hour where everyone goes for cheap eats that can vary in quality (although I liked it) and the dinners with sushi that are amazing albeit expensive.    It's a great place if you're OK dropping about $70 per person with tip if you're eating and drinking."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the tree in the restaurant, good bar, good overall, this only real downer is the insane amount of people stacking up in there on weekend rush hour.. The price is not cheap for what it is.. (ps. bring back the bacon Guacamole please)"}
{"text":"Great place and great service.  The food was amazing and they were accomodating to special requests!  I had the pork tacos and let me tell you; it hit the spot!  Super yummy!"}
{"text":"I could not have been more impressed with this place. Their sushi and Mexican dishes are so on point! Their selection of Mezcal equally impressive! Amazing service. I could not believe I had better Al Pastor tacos here than in Mexico City. Truly a destination meal it was THAT good! The decor was also spot on to the ambiance and the food. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Chelsea in the bar area gave great recommendation.  Had the Green tea which was refreshing. Kellan as a waiter rocked it. The dried fruit guacamole was so good and loved the little tortillas. Great combination. Never would think of asian and mexican but they rock it."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a star for the despicable and disgusting way they discriminate against black people. A friend of mine was just in this restaurant this afternoon with a couple of his friends. They sat down for a nice meal ordered a couple of drinks and food and sat for about twenty minutes just enjoying themselves while waiting for their meal, when the manager came over and told them that the restaurant has a \"dress code\". Two of his friends were wearing sleeveless shirts and no where did it say \"sleeveless shirts not allowed\" and they were not showing anymore than arms. They then asked to speak to the owner of the restaurant. The owner came over and RUDELY asked them to leave the restaurant immediately, but not before they paid the bill in FULL for food they did not get to touch. They refused to pay, again, for food they DID NOT TOUCH and got up to leave and the owner called the cops on them and followed them out of the restaurant. I do not encourage ANYONE to eat here! That's disgusting behavior."}
{"text":"I love the Whimsy Modern Airy Atmosphere. When you walk in and you get the feeling you are one of those beautiful people in a movie that's in a really cool place somewhere. Oh But Yes you are it's Scottsdale AZ !  Asian and Latin Faces are sprinkled on some of the seats and a big really Real Looking tree is planted in the dining room. The Beautiful Restaurant was also pristine clean like a hospital.  Our waiter was very welcoming and explained the menu to us. The food is Asian Mexican Fusion and is TAPAS Style meaning you share small plates and do need to order 2 - 3 plates a person even at lunch time.  We started with the Korean Beef Tacos and the Miso Eggplant. Both were delicious and oh so delicate I think someone must have very good eye sight and used tweezers to add all the tiny delicate flowers and micro veggies in the right places on both these dishes. The Eggplant is a must get dish, it's creamy eggplant flesh that's slightly sweet and laced with miso and sake and also  adorned with sesame seeds. I would say the same about the Tacos  that are just as delicate and are also highly detailed and ARE DELICIOUS. But I do think they should up the price a few dollars and give you more tacos because my photo doesn't show you how small they really are. They are smaller than street tacos and you only get two to share. They were delicious and delicate but they were only a very small taste as they are only two bites at the most.  We also shared the Crispy Chicken Mole, another must get dish. Like everything else the presentation of the food was EXQUISITE! The dish was made with really moist delicious Chicken and Sweet Plantains and pickled red onions to cut the richness of the mole. It wasn't big on crisp but was really oh so delicious and I sure wouldn't mind getting it again.  For lunch this was more of a splurge but this is the kind of place when you want something special and different. I thought dinner prices were reasonable as they didn't differ so much from lunch.  I don't know if everything on the menu is as delicious as what I tried but sure will come back again to find out!  The only thing holding me back from giving 5 stars are the tacos as interesting and delicious as they were. They were smaller than street tacos and you only got two for $7.00. For me I think either the tacos should become slightly bigger or they should up the price a few dollars and give you four tacos to share.  I note everything else I tried seemed in line with what it should cost.  Service was very welcoming and very efficient.   I can't wait to try this place out for dinner!  4.5 Stars"}
{"text":"This is one of those upscale restaurants that wants to be annoying on purpose. I couldn't even set foot inside because apparently valet parking is required. I apologize that I don't trust some rude, immature teenager handling my car (yes he was very rude) but there has to be parking on the property regardless, even if I have to walk a mile in the desert."}
{"text":"Decent food, menu was confusing, too many choices"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in AZ, I enjoyed the food, atmosphere, and did I say the food! If I lived here I would be a SumoMaya regular"}
{"text":"Great food. Glad we decided to come here before we left. Had the pork tacos, Korean barbeque tacos, red dragon roll, shishito peppers, and mango salad. Everything was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Awful....it is so loud. The music is always blaring so high you cannot have a conversation. It is like going to a night club more that a restaurant. Also, a lot of posers."}
{"text":"I loved this place! I was on this side of town for my anniversary and convinced my husband to eat here during the first half of the cardinals game because they had the game on. This was definitely my kind of place! Great open atmosphere, live relaxing band, amazing food and bottomless mimosas!  The only issue was that we sat at a high top for 10 minutes without being acknowledged then ended up moving to the bar where the service was not as good as we were hoping.   My husband had the mexican omelette and loved it!   I had the mexican pho and thought it was good but heavier than I was expecting   We took the bacon guac to go and absolutely love it!   I will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"SO FUN! Love this bar! Their prices are high but their happy hour is great. That is my trick! The parking really sucks and I hate that you have to use valet but maybe it's all part of the fun. The food is great and I always wait for another excuse to go here. It is special!"}
{"text":"A favorite everytime I m in phoenix...run for the \"¬†bar¬†\" table and there is usually room. Otherwise book in advance in the weekend. Love the flavors and ambiance"}
{"text":"Met about 5 of my girlfriends here for happy hour last week.  They have many food options on the happy hour menu.  I had the Korean BBQ Beef Tacos.  Loved them!  I also tried my friends calamari.  It was delicious!  It was very light and airy.  I wish the dish was a little bigger, though.  They have happy hour on the weekends from 2pm to 6pm. Yeah!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night at around 9pm and the atmosphere was great. I love Scottsdale but my one gripe is that there are few places to go that have energy on a Saturday night. This was a welcome exception-- as soon as I walked in it was packed and everyone was dressed to impress. The drinks were tasty (almost too much) and the sushi was delcicious. I will be back soon...maybe even next weekend! lol."}
{"text":"The food is is awful. Nothing tastes fresh and the customer service does need work. We went with a gift certificate and I am so glad we didn't have to use our own money for this place."}
{"text":"SumoMaya was an easy choice considering my friend lives in the apartment complex right next door. Came here for dinner on a Monday night, and I was surprised at how busy it was (thats usually a great sign in my book). Started off with cocktails, I ordered the yuzu mule and my friend ordered the cocktail right above it, the cucumber infused mule. Good news is that the cocktails were very delicious.. bad news is that we definitely needed more than one, as we both agreed that we didn't feel or taste the alcohol.   Moving on to food. We ordered the rock shrimp and a roll to start. (I can't remember the roll's name, but it had tempura and asparagus in it).The rock shrimp was delicious although for $16.00 you only get two pieces.. oh scottsdale, I guess that's is to be expected. The sushi roll was delicious, although not too memorable, because I can't exactly remember what else was in it besides the two ingredients. We also ordered a big bowl of shrimp/crab fried rice to share, and although it was delicious I thought it was a bit too americanized for my taste due to the high level of sauce to rice ratio.   Overall, great place to eat and I will return."}
{"text":"Drove by this place and saw Japanese/Mexican fusion and thought, not a good idea. Read some reviews on Yelp and thought,  what the heck,  try it.   Walk in a the place is very cool inside lots of seating options.  At the sushi bar,  at the kitchen bar,  at the bar bar,  tables or patio.  Lively place too with music going a good \"crowd\" noise that isn't overbearing but you also don't feel like you're in a library either. We couldn't get a table without reservations but any of the bar seating was available. So we sat at the kitchen bar which was a bee hive of activity. Very cool. Our waiter David instantly took over and started making recommendations. Drink choices were awesome! David went through the menu as fusion food can be overwhelming  with choices. We made a couple selections but thankfully David helped out with some.  The best way to order was what he recommended, family style and lots of dishes everyone eats from. The range of flavors from sushi to carnitas tacos is out of this world. The food was so incredible, not a bad choice (and I'll tell you I'm a pretty picky eater). The wait staff checked on us and brought food as ready.    Everything about Sumo Maya is top notch. If you go ask to sit in David's section if he's working. If you're willing, let him make recommendations and adjustments. Best waiter I've even had. Besides, with his haircut he has to be cool....."}
{"text":"You will never ever experience a BRUNCH the way that SumoMaya does it, it's not only has a very unique menu, but the food is tasty and freakin delicious and the environment is fantastic inside the  restaurant and if I recall they even had LIVE music, seriously, check this place out, it's my favorite!"}
{"text":"Just went here for my birthday and it was awesome.  Great drinks, great service, great food, great atmosphere.  We tried several menu items... Highly recommend the pomegranate Guacamole, the california roll with real blue crab, the pork belly entree, sea bass, and ahi tuna tartar dish.  All were to die for.  We'll be back this weekend!"}
{"text":"Mexican Asian fusion is the best thing I've ever tried. Excellent food, excellent atmosphere. Never had anything like it in my life and I guarantee I will be back again."}
{"text":"I listened to all my friends who said this was the greatest restaurant ever.... The location is great, atmosphere is nice but the food is just okay. I believe it is a good people watching restaurant but certainly not a dining experience to impress anyone."}
{"text":"I was looking for an interesting and fun concept restaurant to try out while I was at Spring Training this hear.  Myself and 3 buddies ate here last Thursday night.  We had a good experience.  Lively, trendy, energetic vibe.  Great architecture and open feel to this.  Classic contemporary AZ feel.  We tried many dishes.  The salmon apple maki roll and tempura rockshrimp seemed to be the tables favorite.  Although, we had to try their billionaire roll ($50), I don't care how good it was, I have a problem spending $50 for a roll...but it was really good.  The miso soy sea bass tasted a little fishy, but my dining mates didn't seem to mind.  The shaking beef and the pork tacos were very good.  All in all, I think this fusion tapas place is a great concept with well executed food.  Service:  This is a little tougher for me.  Although generally we had good service from Nicole and the rest of the servers, food runners, managers...but they were all moving too fast and never engaged us to ask us how our dinner was.  Now I don't think that I need someone talking to me about how my vacation is going, however, I do think that the constant frenzied pace that all staff is moving is off-putting.  My recommendation to their GM/Owner would be to train their people to smile more, be friendly, and slow down to engage your customers.  When I come back to Scottsdale, I will come back to SumoMaya for the food...maybe the service will be a little more personal and engaging."}
{"text":"Very nice place, they spent a lot of money building it. They have a DJ and he cranks the music too high for a dinner place, it's not a nightclub. The food is good."}
{"text":"The hostesses Bri and her colleague were outstanding. The margaritas were excellent. The service by Juan was absolutely horrific. He was inattentive,  Distracted and more focused on serving a table of \"bachelorette , giggly girls.\" The food and appetizers were served lukewarm, the pad Thai dish was filled with bean sprouts and tasteless. My partner had to wait about fifteen minutes to be served his second cocktail. The menus were left on our table the entire dinner and the food was never cleared from our table.   THE MANAGEMENT BETTER STEP UP ON THEIR GAME. THIS RESTAURANT.IS OVERRATED AND THE SERVERS NEED TRAINING!,.. I was very disappointed."}
{"text":"If you haven't been then you've got to go! Just opening up right off Scottsdale and Lincoln. Serving up--Awesome Mexican Asian fusion!   Lets paint the picture! Open kitchen so you can see and interact with the cooks. Wood fired grill, seasonal produce, fresh seafood.. You name it Sumo Maya has it! Great concept, great location and even better team! The bright airy interior   ginormous tree and large frosted glass windows welcome you into food lovers utopia!   Let's talk food! Sumo Maya roll to die for with its spicy tuna, crispy rice, fresh micro greens and wasabi cream drizzle! What's an Asian restaurant now a days without edamame? I'm sure that's what your thinking.. Wrong this edamame is unlike any around! They cook it on the wood fired grill gives it the smokey flavor, then lightly toss it in a miso butter! Delicious! Bacon guacamole, salmon ceviche, New York strip, muscles in a coconut lime broth!! I could go on for days but you'll never know till you try it yourself!     Do us all a favor and go check out this hot spot! Yum! I'll be back soon!   Cheers Foodies!"}
{"text":"Best brunch ever. Hands down, best dessert (cheesecake br√ªl√©e) Delicious, fresh and healthy. Super filling, plan to not eat the rest of the day. Scott, the manager was really  helpful and nice! Customer service was spot on. can't miss this spot."}
{"text":"We have always been crazy about this restaurant and brought all of our friends and family for happy hour and dinner.   We went there this afternoon for happy hour and it was horrible !!!  We got half of the portion that we normally received.  It is way overpriced!  They have gotten to big for their britches and there are many other restaurants to get a decent sized portion for happy hour.  Service was mediocre. What a disappointment.  I do  not recommend it."}
{"text":"I like the concept behind SumoMaya, I only wish that they allowed the flavors from Mexico and Asia to play together more often. Where properly blended the result is worth the effort. It has a well executed design and it has quickly become a favored spot for the mid-Scottsdale 'it' crowd."}
{"text":"One of my families favorite restaurants, love the trendyness of the decor and setup. To start off the guacamole is very fresh and has a good taste, second the ceaser salad has to be one of the top best i'v had, always chilled and i love the spicy taste it has. oh and don't forget the egg it comes with it! a lot of people say it's not kid friendly but i bring in my kids and we have no problem, the people at the bar dont judge. overall great place for everyone."}
{"text":"Came here for a bachelorette party, food was delicious and the ambience was nice and lively"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the food here... the staff was great and everything but the portions there were atrocious and the food was mediocre. I felt very scammed the entire time. My table ordered calamari, it was the tiniest portion I've ever seen, especially for an appetizer. It was 14$ for it and it was just very disappointing. The next thing was my coconut curry soup, very bland, and weird peppers in it that didn't go well with the soup flavors at all. Now the entrees were probably the most disappointing especially since we were told they were supposed to be \"family style\". Mine was the pork \"al pastor\" pad Thai, again with the odd peppers, I did get the biggest portion, however the flavors just weren't there and most of it was just cilantro. It was very bland and not much to it. My friend ordered the crispy chicken mole, weirdest combination of flavors ever, mole and plantain, the portion size was very very small and it was very plain as well, the flavors were like a very bland bbq sauce.. Now here's the worst thing for our whole experience, the lobster and crab \"dynamite\", first off, they serve it in the lobster shell, which is just odd and just a waste of space on the dish, second of all, there were pieces of the shell in the food, and thirdly, he had the smallest portion out of everyone, and he paid 23$ for his dish. I feel as if the portions are VERY unfair for the price, this restaraunt needs to reevaluate its dishes in flavor and presentation and I just feel like I was plain scammed out of my money for what I got."}
{"text":"I went here with 2 of my friends and we wound up splitting everything, which was definitely the way to go! The atmosphere and decoration at the place were great too. We went during social hour and were wowed with the service and the food! I would definitely recommend the fried rice, sushi and tacos. My favorite drink was the traditional rocks margarita. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is really creative and delicious. I don't know anywhere else to get a meal like this. It's tapas style so you can try lots of food and share. Everything we tried was great. The cocktails are awesome. It gets really busy. Make a reservation or come at an off time otherwise expect a crowd."}
{"text":"Went for the first time to their brunch. The food was fantastic, but it was the service that made this place top notch. Alexis, the manager jumped right in to help fulfill our every need including adjusting one of the entrees for my boyfriend. The quick and friendly service made this a great B.-Day experience."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place - very relaxed cool vibin' ambiance and the food/saki & service were awesome! Overall, I would rate this establishment an A ...   It may even be my new fav place to eat @ in Old Town and I found the Latin/Asian fusion concept to be straight up genius!!  We showed up late and decided to sit in the bar area because they had a reverse happy hour going on which started @ 10pm.  It's also noteworthy to mention that this particular restaurant is one of the only places in town that you can get a bite to eat @ late night.  We were seated promptly upon arrival and our waitress greeted us right away and was very helpful & accommodating.  We tried several of the tacos off the happy hour menu, the bacon wrapped dates, the billionaire roll (which was out of this world - this was the first time I have ever seen a roll like this and yes it may appear to be a bit pricey, but soooooooo worth it!!), and we also tried the Vietnamese \"shaking beef\" which is their version of filet mignon - all the food was on point and I would highly recommend trying everything we ordered.  We also ordered a bottle of saki, which was very well priced and the server made it a point to continually check in to pour our saki for us, which was very thoughtful.  I would highly recommend this place to everyone and anyone who likes to dine @ a trendy local spot that plays good music, provides great customer service, and of course offers healthy delicious food/drinks - I mean ... what else could one ask for? ;)"}
{"text":"Went here with a couple of girlfriends for happy hour and dinner. We ordered the pumpkin seed guacamole which was awesome. My friend and I both had the Korean bbq tacos and our other friend ordered the mushroom tacos. It was all amazing. Loved it. Service was good and lots of cute guys hanging out there too. :)"}
{"text":"Brunch! Liked it a lot! So for $29.00 you get \"1\" entree and then unlimited small plates and for an extra $10.00 you can have unlimited bloody Mary's or Mimosas etc (you can't mix n match). Now the unlimited small plates are very, very small. They are like children portions. But the food here tastes great. We tried all the small plates and liked them all. Great flavor, made to order, very delicious! Oh, once you finish a small plate then they will place another. Tip \"AVOID\" Sunday brunch after 12:15pm. I overheard the refills on small plates and drinks take forever. So u won't get your moneys worth on food and drink."}
{"text":"Pretty cool hip Mexican Asian fusion kitchen.  Came here today with family for happy hour and all I can say that the food and drinks were good.  We ordered the following items:  Guacamole and chips Crispy Calamari  Salmon avocado roll Crispy pork belly roll  Rock shrimp tempura roll  It was also my son's birthday and we ordered him a chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream really good and he enjoyed the little sparkler on his cake  We would definitely come back here when we visit family in AZ"}
{"text":"Food was just okay to me and we tried quite a few items from the menu including al pastor tacos, Mexican street corn and ginger fried rice. The most memorable food item for me was the king crab guacamole. I would order that again. Unfortunately, I didn't get a pic of it but I did get a pic of the cool tree that's inside. It was a really live atmosphere and the DJ was spinning a combination of old school r&b and hip hop."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere and delicious food. Our waiter wasn't especially attentive though so it took us awhile to get served. Whenever we wanted to order more food, our entire table had to make an effort together to get the waiter's attention. That was frustrating, but with good company you often don't realize the time passing."}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be my favorite in Arizona, but now I'm not so sure. They removed one of my favorite dishes (tamarind shrimp) from the menu in addition to completely changing the items that they serve. Also, it is a bit expensive considering the portion sizes, which are far too small for the average adult. However, the environment is fun and food does taste great, depending on what you get. Especially the guacamole!"}
{"text":"Previous review was 5 star, they changed the menu therefore dropped 2 stars....just not as good.  Bar is still amazing!!"}
{"text":"Soooo noisy that it takes away a lot of what could be great.  Food very good but quite small servings making it expensive.  Definitely a young hip crowd.   Probably won't return because too hard to have a conversation with table mates."}
{"text":"I love Mexican.  He loves Asian.  Should be a match made in heaven right?  Well, kind of.  We wanted to have a late lunch/early dinner, but it turns out only the bar menu is available between the two.  But they do have a great one.  Loved their drink menu and the Sumo-Rita!  Food was just okay for me.  I thought the salmon avocado roll and the spicy yellowtail roll ($5 and $7) were good, but not up to par according to my better half.  The happy hour tacos are a great deal, 2 for $3 or 3 for $5, but just average at best.  I really liked the wild mushroom, the al pastor was good, but nothing special.  The guacamole was the stand-out for me, especially at $5!  Definitely a great happy hour spot.  Good enough to peak my curiosity for their full menu, but not quite good enough for me to prioritize it just yet."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious, lots of variety and quality, however, the service is pretty horrible! The manager is fantastic, but I really wish I didn't need to call him over every time I go because I'm waiting 20-30 minutes for a drink."}
{"text":"Came in with the parents and fiance for a pleasant surprise! The mexi asian fusion sushi was Bomb.com. I highly recommend the maya roll and spicy tuna tacos. Everything was so fresh and came out pretty quickly. Great for sharing and people watching. Dress to impress :)"}
{"text":"Let say for a moment, you could stuff your face with tacos and sushi.  Or Pollo chicharon with kimchee fried rice...at the same place.  AT THE SAME PLACE?!?  Yup.   This joint, does exactly that.   concept-5 stars.  Mexican and Japanese fused together? YES. food-5 stars: FLAVOR EXPLOSIONS in your mouth? YES.  For detail, see below.  decor:  5 stars: I felt like I was in some hip LA restaurant, complete with the plastics. service: 5 stars: I never felt like I needed to find someone to fill my water or give me food. Props to everyone being attentive and gracious with the food suggestions. drinks: 5 stars-I had a Tokyo mule, 'nuff said.   We ordered, and it's recommended, you share a variety of plates.  It's tapas/family style so, you'll want to order a variety of things to sample.  Our list:  LUMP CRAB GUACAMOLE-fresh, seasoned well, and served with fried tortillas-YUMM.  CHICHARRON DE POLLO-imagine spicy chicken tenders, but better. YUP. KIMCHEE FRIED RICE-eggs, mushroom, and a kick. Paired well with beef. YES ROLLO CHINGON-adobo, jalapeno, and a strawberry glaze.  Top seller, and pretty good. YUP. VIETNAMESE STYLE \"SHAKING BEEF\"-filet mignon with an amazing serrano chile sauce-YES.  Everything was awesome, and I'm embarrassed to tell you that I wanted to order more.   Highly recommend.  Not only for the food, but for the people watching."}
{"text":"What an amazing lunch!   Had been meaning to try this place out for a while. Came in for a late lunch and fell in love with it immediately! The decor is awesome!! There's a giant tree in the middle of the restaurant. Everything is pink, orange and clear..very aesthetically pleasing.   The food is even better than the decor! We had the Suzuki roll (created by the head chef Andrew Suzuki), Chili Crab Noodles and Mexican pho. All flavors were multi-dimensional. We will be coming back many times in the future! A new favorite for sure."}
{"text":"This place has the atmosphere and great food!!   Love the guacamole.   The tacos are small, but the quality of the ingredients and the flavor are well worth it."}
{"text":"Reservation at 715, table not ready until 730, ordered drink at 731, no drink until 746....manager not driving service. No appetizer ordered because waitress is not capable.  Does it really matter what the food taste like if you can't get any....horrible, never again"}
{"text":"REALLY excited to try this place!! Arroz con Pato, Shishitto Roll are great! We had a fluke Tamarind Shrimp of which 2 of us tasted, I projectile spat it into my napkin and my friend said it was like rank fish/toilet water. What bothered us, the chef reportedly tasted it and said it was fine. Obviously, something happened to our dish that wasn't suppose to as all the reviews on the dish was excellent. Instead of admitting it, they tried to cover it up which just rubs me the wrong way. Things happen!...but the service is how you handle it. Manger didn't even apologize.  Update: the manager contacted us and was very professional about the situation and because of this, I would go back."}
{"text":"If you don't know, you better ask somebody.  Sumo Maya is just yum.  The taco deals on happy hour are phenomenal; 2/$3 is pretty awesome.  They're smaller street tacos, but honestly two tacos and a shared app is plenty to hold me over for a couple hours.  The guac is good (no cheese please), mushroom taco, cod taco, calamari is really different and the few pieces I had were great.  I tried their spicy yellowtail on this last visit and have no complaints.  The drinks are $2 off during hh, so not a stellar deal there, but to be fair all their cocktails have fresh ingredients and are made with attention to detail. Its not just a pre-mix pour.  The Green Tea cocktail was great, as was the Grapefruit mojito.  One caveat to hh is that it is limited to the bar area ... which is fine if its not summer in Phx.  =/  This means if you get there after 430pm, you're pretty much stuck on the patio in the heat.  There are misters and fans, and screens for shade, but its still a solid 90 degrees out there.  If you want HH in the summer, get there early, or prepare to be warm."}
{"text":"As someone who was visiting Arizona I was recommended to go to this place by a few people as a great Scottsdale restaurant.   Honestly the best thing about this place is the vibe and decor. It'll be a fun night out with friends.   The food is woefully mediocre. I wanted to like it but literally everything I ordered (crispy calamari, crispy pork belly sushi and another sushi that I can't remember because the sauce took over all the flavor) was smothered in this weird generic \"spicy\" sweet chili sauce. Maybe if that sauce was on the side I could have tasted the food more, it was very overwhelming. I've never been to a restaurant where 3 different dishes were steamrolled by the same sauce.   Strange move.   The (thankfully) sauce-less asparagus was okay. Not bad but not great. I may try this place again if I go back Arizona but I'd for sure have the sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Fun & cool place to hangout on weekend before you hit the clubs. Love the decorations with a large tree in the middle center, open sushi bar , large menu , delicious looking cocktails , never get disappointed on the food . The only problem is depend on the date & time you coming , you can be waiting a little too long for table, also the food can take longer too, don't come here if you really really hungry, this place get super crowded loud ."}
{"text":"The place looks cool enough...our waiter was awesome & their drinks are amazing. But the food I felt was just trying too hard be something it is not. It wasn't bad it's just not what I would consider good fusion food. They barely put any seafood or chicken in anyone's dishes. I don't mind spending money on great food but this food was not great it was just ok. I'm pretty sure I could do better at home. I had the Pork al pastor pad Thai is was too sweet & not a lot of flavors going on. I must say we enjoyed the deserts. The birthday boys got a flan desert with ice cream & it didn't suck! We also ordered a chocolate cake & I had some Mexican street corn that I thought was the best thing I had besides the flan, cake, & drinks. Probably won't come here again"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin! When I first heard of a Mexican Asian restaurant opening up, I had no idea what to expect but I figured that since I like both cuisines, I would probably enjoy it. I was right. They did a great job fusing the cuisines. In fact, what took the relationship so long to bloom!?   Ambiance:  Looks are deceiving and the exterior of this place looks nothing like the interior. From the outside, you'd think it just looks like any other generic restaurant, but don't be deceived. Step through the doors and you immediately enter this open, airy and trendy restaurant that even has a real tree hanging out in the middle of the restaurant...yes a tree! I especially found the pictures of random people on the chairs pretty entertaining. The restaurant itself has a combination of a wrap around bar and then dining area. Make a reservation to be on the safe side! This is great spot for a night out with friends, a double date or event a spot to get a couple cocktails and apps!   Food & Drinks:   Now, moving on to the most important part, food and drinks! First, the drinks. I enjoyed the Passion Fruit sangria and boy does that pack a punch! I expected it to be sweet, but instead it was pretty potent...in a good way! Next, the food. This restaurant is all about sharing the plates and it's nice because that means you can try much more! Everything on the menu looked delicious, so our group of four ordered it all!   Guacamole - they serve up some of the most unique guacamole choices I've ever seen! We decided to order the Lump Crab Guacamole. I'm ruined because I don't think I will ever be able to enjoy \"regular\" guacamole again. It was the perfect amount of crab and the key lime added a tasty twist. The only downfall was that it only came with four tortilla chips and if you wanted to order more, it was $1 more per order of chips. The guacamole is already $14, so with the additional chips, it made for a pricey appetizer!   Rock Shrimp Tempura - I'm such a fan of rock shrimp and especially when it has some Asian flavoring to it. This dish was anything but disappointing and I could have gobbled this dish up all by myself! The rock shrimp tempura comes with a variety of veggies including tomatoes and green beans. The summer mayo had the perfect flavorful kick to it. I want my own order next time!  Rollo Chingon Sushi Roll (cooked) - This roll comes with grilled shrimp, guacamole, jalapeno and has a balsamic strawberry glaze. See where they do a good job fusing the two cuisines? I had no idea I was eating a Mexican food sushi roll because it tasted delicious! It came with eight bites and was great for sharing.  Suzuki Roll - This roll was another great Mexican Asian combo with spicy tuna, avocado, and then a chipotle aioli! They have eight bites in a roll so this was another good one to share and very flavorful.   Summer Corn - order this! I loved it and could have eaten it all on my own. The spiced popcorn on top of the corn created an interesting yet flavorful kick to it!   Bacon Wrapped Dates - an order comes with six, so there's plenty to share however you will want more than one! These little guys are so good! The combination of salty bacon and sweet date compliments each other perfectly.  Half Lobster _ Crab Dynamite - order this but be warned, you won't want to share! This was the best thing I ate on the menu!   After my experience, I would say that my top three favorite things I ate were the rock shrimp, corn and lobster/crab. I would order the three items next time but I would probably order the lobster as my own entree next time. It's that good!"}
{"text":"I came here for the sushi with my co-worker and had a decent experience.  We sat down at the sushi bar and like the friendliness of the sushi makers and the general atmosphere.  They play cool background music and the place is nicely decorated with a modern feel.  We started off with some standard rolls which were good.  The salmon avocado roll was the best of the four that we ordered.  The texture was nice with the smoothness of the avocado and the salmon went down smoothly as well.  The spicy tuna yellowtail was not as good, but was a little more one-note with a little too much heat that overwhelmed the roll.  The speciaty sumo were not nearly as good, being a little flat.  The shishito roll looked really elegant with the salmon topped with slices of kiwi, but it ended up being rather flat.  I couldn't taste the kiwi at all and the peppers kind of overwhelmed the roll.  The hemachi roll was one-note as well.  There was just too much acidity.  The price was reasonable at ~ $60 for two people after tip and we both were full."}
{"text":"1st time there...had to meet friends from San Diego and Hawaii that were staying close....picked this place, a little nervous due to never being there....my friends and I LOVED IT!  From the minute I walked in, customer service was MOST EXCELLENT!  Thank you Chelsea S. for being SO WONDERFUL!  I was also visited by a Manager, Alex....Again, very nice and really wanted to make sure our needs were being met.  She was also WONDERFUL!  The place was packed but we got a great spot by the bar.  I love how the patio is slightly enclosed.  Once the sun went down, this was opened.  With the combination of that and the misters, it made for a trendy cool visiting area!  Now for the food....my friends could not get over how great it was, they are foodies from great ocean areas and really loved the combo and different approach with some of the items they ordered.  I got the kimchi fried rice and I am trying to figure out when I can get back to get some more.....YUMMY!  Drinks were great, I would recommend the grapefruit beer.  So refreshing.  Atmosphere - very up to the minute, warm and welcoming.  Love the colors and the zen style and feel.  My new hang out!  Thank GOD I live close!  THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!"}
{"text":"Went here on two separate occasions for dinner. Once was Thanksgiving weekend and we were seated on the outside patio in a very cold spot and we actually moved seats. Food is served tapas style which was great for sharing. On the next visit we had a larger group outside and it was much better. It also looks like they had fixed the table that was too cold from our first visit (3 other parties were sat there on our first visit and asked to move as well). Service has been awesome and so has the food. Cannot wait to go back again soon!"}
{"text":"Honestly I must say this is the IT place to go for a fun and delicious night out, we came here a few times with our friends and we keep coming back because everything is so good and authentic...the place is very hip and the vibe and ambience is definitely the shit... The service this Sabbath much our waitress Alyssa with the cool haircut outdid and satisfied even the pickiest ones in our crew. Definitely recommend coming here and ordering the pomegranate guacamole, Rock shrimp tempura and tuna tostada... their drinks are amazing as well !!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful time and very tasty dinner last nite. We tried several items and they were all fantastic. The staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. There were only two negatives;  1) the plates took longer to come out and the staff were taking plates to the wrong tables, 2) it was very annoying when the hostesses continued to make rounds tracking tables. The tracking was so often it became rude."}
{"text":"We came this past Thursday with my boyfriend and his family visiting from Utah..we made reservations and we were sat down and had to wait over 5 minutes to even get a drink menu when the waitress finally came over (the server had only 1 so the 4 of us had to share)....I was disappointed that it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks..especially since the reviews we looked at prior to coming said the same thing, takes forever to get a drink...we all ordered simple margaritas but again took about 10 minutes,,,then I was given the wrong margarita, which had to be taken back and remade....the calamari came out cold as our first dish...the sushi was good, always can count on that from prior visits...the taco dishes as well came out somewhat cold as if they'd been sitting for a few  minutes....when we ordered another round of drinks, the server took the order...left and then came back 5 minutes later asking \" had we decided on drinks?\" as if she had forgotten 5 minutes prior she just took our order....think she realized this when we started at her like \"what we just ordered?\"; not my most pleasant sumo maya experience....seems they are lacking in service and people working there for how many people are in the restaurant because seems a little slow service wise...the dessert was good however not sure what it was can't remember but that was probably the best part of the evening."}
{"text":"This place would have gotten 5 stars if not for its manager.  Wow.  We were very surprised with his careless and rather rude demeanor.  He actually seemed to enjoy it as well which made it frankly, a little weird.  We'd asked 3 times for forks but were never brought any.  We'd been served our appetizers which 3 of us couldn't eat with the chopsticks on the table.  It's Mexican/Asian fusion so you'd think they might consider that not everyone eats with chopsticks and set the tables with forks - but there you are.  Regardless, after asking a 3rd time and still not receiving forks, one of us got up and happened to find the manager and ask for some.  Dang if that guy didn't cop an attitude right away, get defensive, then rude...and then almost sneer about it every time he later passed our table.  To say it was off-putting really would be an understatement.  This guy is dead weight.  They need to lose him.  How hard is it to say, \"Hey, sorry that happened?  Let me get you some.\"    The food was delicious though - all of it!  Try the bacon wrapped dates, the calamari, the rock shrimp and the tacos!  The rolls were great too!"}
{"text":"The service was great but the sushi was at best AVERAGE! The crab was nasty! The ahi tuna tostadas were very yummy though! Their wine list is very limited when it comes to Merlots by the glass (they only have 1) They have good bottle selections! The restraunt is very modern and posh. There are definitely better sushi restraunts in Scottsdale then here."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try SumoMaya for quite some time, and this visit was most certainly not the last.  We came in during happy hour, and the bar was quite full.  We were seated in the main dining room.  We were told happy hour would be honored for us even though it was supposed to be bar and high tops only.  Our server gave us great recommendations, the pineapple pisco was a great cocktail, and the bacon wrapped dates and Korean bbq taco are a must try. I can't wait to try the ceviches and the guacamole.  Our server, Benjamin, was wonderful.  Asian Mexican fusion, in both flavor and ambiance, at its finest."}
{"text":"THE WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER EXPERIENCE.   I was very excited to try this place after I had seen all the great food reviews, however the wait staff was terrible. For example, I asked for water when I first got there and it took them 45 minutes to get it to me and then then another five to ask me if I was ready to order. I also felt that the my waiters were very condescending despite the long waits they had. Of note, the place was NOT busy at this time. The rest of my time there was not any better. Although the food here is fairly good, it is not worth returning for such poor service and having to stems hours on a meal mainly waiting on their staff."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here. Fushion style - elements of Japanese and Mexican cooking. Need to know what to order to optimize the experience of the fusion menu. We Ordered several items to share, probably one dish too much. Renegade kitchen style - food comes out when ready. Ramen with melt in your mouth Pork Belly, noodles and an egg. The ramen was hearty and outstanding. Couldn't get enough of it and I continue to crave it. Also had soft shell crab sushi roll with Jabanero-Mango Sauce-  the pepper gave it a nice kick, as I am usually not too into sweet tastes overpowering my sushi. We ordered a soft shell Korean Beef Taco, 2 come with one order. They are small, but delicious. Guacamole selection is different here, you can get it with lump crab meat, chicharone, catija cheese, or corn, with house made tortilla flats for dipping. Place has a really cool vibe, and a tree grows in the middle.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was so excited after hearing all the hype about this place. Looked cool, dishes sounded interesting. But, that is where it ended. Our service was SO terrible. By terrible, I mean....what service? We rarely saw our waitress. Our food came out at such totally different times over the course of an hour that some people at our table of 8 were finished long before the others even started. The food was meh. I was expecting better or even more interesting than what hit my tastebuds. Any higher end sushi place has similar, and even better flavor combos now. The one highlight was the mushroom tacos. We all agreed it was our favorite. I'd recommend to go to see and be seen, hang in a cool spot, but don't come hungry."}
{"text":"The appetizers are great! The guacamole, ceviche and calamari was different and very tasty.  Excellent presentation while marrying the flavors well. Portions are smaller and served tapas style. The plantains were great however, I don't think the vinaigrette worked out there. I could have done without the sauce. I like what they did with the chips though. That made a lasting effect.   I would definitely suggest making a reservation however, we did get in very quickly on a Sunday night. Trendy spot but has a very casual feel to it.   I would definitely come back when I'm in town. There's a wide variation of food that everyone can appreciate. Really great place.   Complimentary valet parking. Great service."}
{"text":"This place is really quite good ! Scottsdale is not generally the best city for food, but This one is really delicious. I've not tried one bad dish yet. It's very consistent! It's also kind of nice that the portions are small ! It's just perfect for people that are looking to enjoy a classy setting with some gourmet food that isn't going to make you regret your caloric intake! The owner has 2-3 more restaurants in the valley (different types of cuisines) and every restaurant he is involved in is delicious !!! I guess it pays off to live and study in Europe :) ."}
{"text":"Waited for our confirmed reservation for 40 min, saw other parties getting seated, left without eating dinner, management was less than apologetic, did not offer any help in resolving the issue"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner on a Sunday night. The decor is very hip and modern with a club vibe. The food is as promised, fusion-y modern goodness. We had the roasted corn side, bacon wrapped dates, spicy crab noodles, and lobster mango sushi. All of it was tasty and provided a good variety of flavors to enjoy. I plan on coming back for their enticing brunch deal."}
{"text":"Great trendy ambience with a clever melange of East and Hispanic cuisines. Surprised to find food that more than met my expectations. Great service too. Would definitely go back.   Tried the ceviche, pomegranate guac (excellent), Korean beef tacos, lobster/crab (excellent) and a noodle dish. Only thing that was ok were the peppers."}
{"text":"Good quality food. Great infusion on Asian and Mexican cuisine. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Gooooooood stuff.   Get the edamame. Get the street corn. But whatever you do, get the duck taco.   Honestly, if you don't get the duck tacos, you're out of your god damn mind.   Amazing."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants!! I love the decor and gorgeous fake tree in the center. The food is delicious and I haven't had anything yet that didn't make my mouth water. I suggest the calamari. They put a unique and amazing twist to it.  It can be a little pricey but hey, it is in Old Town."}
{"text":"We always use Restaurant Week to try out new restaurants.  Super disappointed that this year so many places put forth such a half-hearted effort this RW---but not SumoMaya.  I thought Asian-Mexican was going to be crazy---and it is---crazy GOOD!  We started with a first course: I had the tea-smoked duck with this spicy blackberry chutney.  Duck cooked perfectly, and the chutney. Oh!  DH started scraping it off my plate and eating it with a spoon.  He had little sushi rolls topped with tender, mojo marinated shrimp---yum!  Then we split a house salad---not on the RW menu, but we were hungry.  Crisp, fresh, fab soy-ginger dressing.  Next our entrees arrived.  DH got the Achiote Chicken, which was quite good---very tender and flavorful.  But my dish was the best, and DH said that he would order our next visit: the Pork al Pastor Pad Thai.  To. Die. For.  It was just to good to explain.  Desert was this insane Tres Leches cake topped with a crown of toasted meringue.  The meringue and the cake were so-so-sweet, but then there was a layer of this incredibly tangy citrus--lime?  It was so tart it took your breath away, and combined with the sweet---bliss.  Our server was Nicole and she was PERFECT!  Noise level unbelievable between disc jockey and tipsy Happy Hour crowd---when we definitely return, it will probably be for lunch when the noise level might be more bearable.  But the whole experience so good, we'd come for dinner and wear earplugs!"}
{"text":"I opened with the korean beef taco. The kimchee was a nice touch as a topping but the beef was more brisket than korean beef. Still a decent taco. 2.5/5 (minus point for semi-false advertising).   Being a New Orleans native, I was instantly drawn to the Mexican Pho dish, as I am a Pho-holic back home. Decided to give it a whirl and I am so glad I did. While the only thing pho'ish is the cilantro, rice noodles and lime, it tied amazingly well with the soup. Only thing keeping this from being 5/5 is I would have the preferred the soup to be a bit thinner. It is a very thick soup. 4/5  Service was very good, restaurant is trendy and whimsical, and the music selection was fun, though a bit loud, even for lunch."}
{"text":"OK, just smack me in the back of the head.  I thought a Mexican/Asian tapas restaurant was going to be a bunch of overpriced small plates that leave me stopping for a burger after dinner.  I also was not expecting the ambiance--the place is pretty electric, a mass of staff activity with great warmth and attention to detail, vibrant conversation, music and visual appeal. But the food:  As a group of 4, we just started ordering a few dishes and kept going until we decided it was time to stop.  Not too little, and certainly not a bunch of leftovers.  With this type of meal, everyone is guaranteed to get what they want.  The guacamole, in about 5 different flavours are amazing. The rock shrimp was a table favourite.  Even when we got to desert, I asked them to add the salted caramel ice cream from one desert to another, the rice pudding.  That was an amazing pairing, and I suspect it will make it on the menu.  At the end, we were definitely full, and the bill with libations came out to a pleasing $50 a head.  It's a win!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept with some hits and misses. Maybe I'm getting old, but I don't understand how loud dance-beat music compliments any dining experience. Does anybody play music at home that is so loud they can hardly talk during dinner? Our waitstaff was friendly and efficient but her high-octane \"valley girl on steroids\" delivery may force me to punch the next person who says \"absolutely!!\" or \"definitely!!!\"  The guac with pomegranate was quite good as was the salmon ceviche, although it was really more like sashimi in sauce. The chopped salad had interesting ingredients and was pretty good but a bit bland. The pad thai had great flavors but suffered from way too much sauce. We had toffee cake dessert that was exceptional.  Overall it was interesting and I might try it again."}
{"text":"Hello, I have never written a review before. However, after eating here I felt I would be doing it a dis-service by not writing. My parents and I went to SumoMaya after hiking up Tom's Thumb Trail. We made it in time for the happy hour and it was delicious. We were a under dressed for the occasion, wearing only the clothes that we used to hike up a mountain. The employees didn't bat an eye, thank god! First we ordered bacon guacamole, which I must say was the best guac I've ever eaten. We went ahead and ordered three servings of SumoMaya's happy hour tacos. First came the Sesame Ginger Tacos. The good news, they were fantastic! The better news, it was only getting better! They brought out the Korean Beef Taco and Pork \"Al Pastor\" Tacos at the same time. Both of them, especially the Pork \"Al Pastor\" Tacos were the best tacos i've ever eaten.  I highly recommend this establishment. You won't be disappointed. You might even see me, as I will for sure be coming back!   Btw, it is also a great place to watch football as they have 4 HUGE TV's over the bar.   PSS, amazing margaritas!"}
{"text":"The food was very good, the service was fabulous, the decor delightful. But at $50 without tip for two for lunch (iced teas, no alcohol), I won't be back unless it's a special occasion."}
{"text":"Fancy fancy Asian Mexican fusion.  Personally, I'm a little wary when it comes to anything Asian fusion.  Mainly because I am Asian, and I get overly critical with the spices.  SumoMaya had turned that negativity to a really positive experience.  We started with the bacon guacamole appetizer.  You're thinking, bacon?  Really?  Seems like everything comes with bacon lately.  Trust me, you won't want to pass this bacon opportunity.  They use thick slices of crisped bacon, cut into large chunks.  it was more of a garnish for the housemate guac.  Yum!  Il liked how extra chunky the guac was, served with the bacon and two pieces of fresh cracklin'.  Never tried fried pork rinds until now, and realize I'm a fan.  I ordered the Korean Tacos and the spicy hamachi roll.  Gotta try both worlds.  Their sushi was average, and felt it lacked the spicy flavor it claimed in its name.  It would've been cool to see the roll made with some southwest spices rather than a traditional roll.    The Korean beef tacos were very good.  They really captured the Korean bbq flavors in the meat and i loved the pickled radish garnish on it.  The acidity cut through the garnish."}
{"text":"I keep coming here once in a while as I loved their food however since the last couple times not only is the food getting monotonous but also the most of the rolls I have tried turned up with too much sauce muting the subtle and delicate flavours of the fish or the main ingredients.   Also the place has lost its surprise element as the food is getting repetitive and I wish they added some seasonal offerings to keep the regular people coming back for more.   New discoveries that I loved : the green curry rice was amazing. Nicely presented as well as flavourful.    Complete let downs: The crispy chicken mole was too dry and tough not sure if it was a mistake on the day I tried it but won't be venturing this direction. The Red Dragon Roll came with way too much sauce. I couldn't even taste the eel or tuna. The Apple- salmon roll was Ok but I am sure they can do better.   I have loved so much of their food that I am almost sad that I had to come back and remove a star and edit the review. And this the first time I have done this esp. in case of a restaurant I have loved to visit often. Won't be coming here soon."}
{"text":"Had great service for my birthday dinner here! I don't remember our waitress' name but she was awesome! Made great recommendations for our group and when the wrong ceviche came out she made sure the correct one was ordered in at no additional cost! Loved it"}
{"text":"We stopped at Sumomaya hoping to have a drink and some appetizers. We are not from the area, but had heard rave reviews of this place and it was close to our resort. We walked in on a Monday night, and they were not super busy. We like to sit at the bar, but always check in with the host just in case they seat their bar specifically (we know most places don't, but some do, so we always try to be respectful and not just blow past the host stand). The hostess was extremely rude and responded to our request to sit at the bar like we were ridiculous for saying anything to her. We sat down and there were at least 4 people working behind the bar, possibly one in training. Once sitting at the bar we were not greeted, but just handed a drink  menu and asked if we were going to order dinner. We said we weren't sure, but would like to see a menu. Then another bartender comes over and sets down some sort of placemat that were both soaking wet. We ordered a drink, which came quickly, while we looked over the menu. Maybe I was missing something, but i didn't see any sushi on the menu, I'm talking like nigiri or sashimi, which is what we were hoping for as we weren't hungry enough for rolls. I was planning to ask about that, but we finished our drink and not one of the 4 people behind the bar ever came back to check on us or see if we wanted to order anything. By this point we were both feeling uncomfortable and had decided to go. We were able to get the attention of one bartender to get our check at least. Was super bummed because we were really excited about this place!"}
{"text":"First, I love the tree in the middle of the restaurant!  The ambiance is very trendy, and hip.  There is a lot of color that makes this place different than most restaurants.  It creates a fun vibe!  Second, the food is unique with asian tacos and sushi.  However, the sushi is average.  I think there can be improvement there.    The tacos are pretty good though, and the bacon wrapped dates are really good!  Our server was \"Johnny on the spot\".  He was really attentive and always smiling.  He explained all the dishes to us in great detail.  My only constructive criticism (besides the sushi) was that happy hour was only for the bar, which is a really small area.  Our table was next to the bar, but we were considered part of the dining room.    Hopefully, they change this so more people can enjoy HH!"}
{"text":"Great place to come for tapas and drinks! My sister and I tried to come here like a month and a half ago, not realizing they only serve drinks between lunch and dinner. Unfortunately we were hungry and she is not of age yet haha so we decided to try again! I love all the lanterns outside of the restaurant. It looks really awesome, especially when they were lit up at night. I also loved the big tree inside. We walked in and were seated right away, even though it was pretty crowded. We sat at the sushi bar which I thought was cool! It was fun watching them roll the sushi.  Our waiter was nice, did a good job! I ordered a cocktail with rum and ginger beer and it was really spicy! But it was a good sized drink which was great. I just wouldn't order it with something spicy! We started off with the traditional guacamole too, which was served with sopapillas. Guac was a tad bland for my taste, but I ate it with a spoon once I ran out of sopapillas, so I can't complain. My drink and guacamole was served pretty quickly. I was debating between the mushroom tacos or the veggie sushi, went for the tacos. Tacos were absolutely fabulous, I wish I could have had more than two! Yum! My sister got kimchi noodles, and they let her substitute chicken for crab. She liked it but it was very spicy for her. It was real expensive. Everything is fresh and such, but very pricey for a poor preschool teacher like myself. But nice for a once in a while treat."}
{"text":"The ahi tuna tostada, spicy crab noodles, shishito roll, pork (al pastor) pad thai noodles were all awsome. The sticky choclate cake was ok, but I cant say that I would be craving it again. Thankfully their outdoor seating was shaded/covered and cool."}
{"text":"We went last evening hoping for a fun night with some interesting food.  We made reservations even though it was pretty early.  When we arrived it was very loud and mostly empty.  We were taken to a table outside.  Since its 110 at 6 pm we said we preferred inside.  Apparently inside tables are reserved for those who call in reservations not those who use the Internet.  We were offered a seat at the sushi bar.   The seats are so far apart we couldn't hear each other with out yelling or leaning over.   We left.   Menu is interesting but not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"A bit full of itself. \"Experimental Nippon-Mex\". Wannabe highbrow dining experience but menu, while unique, just ends up being corny. Food without much taste, subdued flavour. Portions are small, expensive. Waiter was great though. Try it, you may or may not like it."}
{"text":"Every time I travel to Scottsdale I try to stop in here. Excellent food full of flavor and diversity. The sea bass is great. Great selection of foods and beverages. The atmosphere is high energy and can get loud at times."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to try out this restaurants with the whole Asian-Mexican fusion thing. I'm glad I did. I've been here several times and will be back. They have one of the best Kimchi friend rice and Ramen in Phx. I'm from LA (lots of Korean restaurant) and been to Japan to compare. A must try if you are a foodie!"}
{"text":"Long wait even with a reservation. Came in with a big party and the staff seemed they couldn't handle that, people in smaller groups with no reservation were seated before my party. When asked to put two tables together we were looked at like we spoke a foreign language.   Music was great but a little loud, service and food were not good at all.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"In the last couple of years I have eaten at SumoMaya at least half a dozen times. My experience has been a mixed bag.  Here is the good news. I love the food they offer up. It has taste, texture and a sense of creativity and innovation. Just a couple of hours ago my dining companions and I ordered a number of dishes and were absolutely satisfied with everything we got. So kudos for clearing the highest bar.  Here is the bad news. Service is less than mediocre. I do want to clarify: when I say service is below mediocre it reflects elements of service such as speed, accuracy and follow up. In each of these three elements our experience was not good at all even though the server was friendly and amiable.  A dining companion ordered a drink from the bar. It was a disaster not just in how long it took for the order to be filled but also in that the barkeep had no idea on how to craft the drink.  In all fairness, the staff recognized many of the missteps and offered us free dessert. We appreciated that.  However, service is a challenge and needs attention."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Interesting mix of cooking styles and cool vibe to hang out in.  Al Pastor Pad Thai was amazing."}
{"text":"Tried it on a whim last night and was blown away by all the elements u hope for in a restaurant. Lively atmosphere, beautifully decorated, friendly, knowledgeable staff, great location, and last but not least SUPER delicious unique foods at an affordable rate. My new favorite Scottsdale spot. Try the curry muscles!"}
{"text":"Food orders were never staggered like they were suppose to be.  Appetizers came after the main course.  Sushi roll never came.  I had to ask twice for a beer to be delivered and another cocktail never came.  Food was good, atmosphere was very cool, but service sucked."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great atmosphere and the food is out of this world! My favorite dishes would have to be the Coconut Ahi Tuna Tartar and the Apple-Salmon sushi roll. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Man, this was fun.  I love tapas or small-plates style places.  Everything we had was really good with the standout being the al pastor pad thai.  Medium was nice and hot, but not overbearing and the flavor combinations were perfect.    The only negative was the spacing of the courses.  Sometime multiple dishes came out all at once and then there would be a loooong lag before the next round, well after we had leisurely finished what was previously brought out..  With that said, I'd rather they be spaced out rather than rushed.  This is a fun place with solid food in a really cool environment.  I can't wait to go back and work through more of the menu."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Alphaville - Forever Young)  Lets dine in style, lets drink for a while Bo Bites can taste we'll only review what we try Hoping for the best and expecting the best! Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?  Let us dine now or let us drink forever We don't have the power but we never say never Sitting in a dining room, start with ceviche The Shrimp heads for the entree  (Skip)  SumoMaya, Let's all go to SumoMaya! I really want to try SumoMaya, SumoMaya  3.5 Stars in my book!  SumoMaya is definitely one of the hottest restaurants in town.  The place was popping on a Wednesday night and my friends and I had reservations at 8:15pm, but didn't sit until about 8:45pm.  So we ordered drinks at the bar needless to say.  When we finally sat we went for it!  Lump Crab guacamole, Hamachi Roll, Hamachi Ceviche, Bacon Wrap Dates, Pork Belly Ramen, and Head-On Giant Shrimp.  The Lump Crab had a mesh of cilantro, lime, and it came with some tostada shells, which my gal pals thought was too hard.  I liked it overall as a starter; soft mushy guacamole and crab meat with an extra crunch of the tostada!  The Hamachi Roll & Ceviche was probably one of my least favorite -- The roll was atop with a pickled jalapeno pepper that just shocked my palates and the Ceviche came with a yuzu green apple aioli that didn't seem to go well in my opinion.  Leave the green apple out haha!  As for the Bacon Wrap Dates, I didn't care for these either since the charred bacon necessary to make a wrap was burnt and dry. The Pork Belly Ramen was good and how any ramen entree should taste like; nice warm broth and the noodles was cooked just right.  The star of the night for me was the Giant Shrimp!  Cooked to perfection as it carefully slide off the shell with the garlic-creamy sauce and a spicy hint in the end!  Along with the cherry tomatoes to finish off this dish giving it a final sweetness!  Best grilled shrimp I've tasted in a while!  Service was good overall and attentive as it was pretty busy that night.  The ambiance is hot as I stated earlier.  There was a large tree in the middle giving the restaurant an outdoorsy flare.  Designed by restaurateur German Osio and Chef Herb Wilson whom was inspired by a food truck in LA serving up Mexican-Asian food; thus spawning SumoMaya - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant.  So clean and a wonderful and different menu.  We had the miso eggplant, ginger fried rice, fish tacos and chicken mole'.  For desert we had the panna cotta. There were 3 of us and we shared.  They have tons for vegans and gluten free. Dianelle our waitress was great."}
{"text":"Get ready to yell, the music is LOUD. Reservations are recommended,  we got in at 9pm. Service was really good, our waiter was on the ball.  Great drink suggestions,  great starter suggestions,  great meal.   Everything is sharble so bring your friends."}
{"text":"Be warned: They had a menu change here in the last 3 months, and the hostess failed to tell us this when we made our large reservation. We have planned many events here in the past, but we will not be coming here again. The brunch is a COMPLETE RIP OFF. $29 (without drinks) for \"endless\" tiny sized appetizers and 1 tiny entree. You need to ask multiple times for them to bring out more of these tiny appetizers to the point where it is just irritating. We ended up spending the additional $10 for bottomless mimosas, and again you need to ask multiple waiters, multiple times to bring you more. The portion sizes have significantly decreased, I've never left brunch HUNGRY before after spending $30. The sushi they bring with the lunch is just California rolls, and one other roll with the tiniest piece of fish. The second and third round of sushi was just avocado and cucumber. NOT WORTH IT. So many other places around the area for much better lunch at half the price."}
{"text":"Wow! Wow! Wow! First time in Arizona and had reservations at 10pm and they had an amazing DJ! Playing music by request and super nice. Looking At the menu everything looked great. But our group of 8 for fitted our menus and let the waitress and chief choose our dishes! From the start to end the service was amazing! The food was flavoring and mouth watering. Asian and Mexican infused that I thought was strange but man did they prove me wrong! I wish they had more locations but I will Go back anytime I'm in Arizona!! Absolutely amazing hands down. Waitress was fun and attentive. She deserved more than 20% bc of the experience she made all of us have. We had about an 8 course meal but sharing portions and we still couldn't finish all the food."}
{"text":"Sumomaya is a fun, trendy fusion restaurant. I've been here several times both for lunch and dinner and have always been impressed with the food and drinks. The decor is funky, and I love the giant tree in the middle of the space.   My favorite margarita is the Jalape√±o Monk {sauza blue silver tequila | jalape√±o infused green chartreuse | lime | pineapple | mint | cucumber} and is a must have if you like spicy drinks!  I've had a few of their different options but I generally start with the pomegranate guac. Their sushi is good, but it's not the more traditional style that I really love so I haven't tried much of it. I've had the Billionaire Roll and the pork belly roll, both were good. The rock shrimp tempura is great, I love the spicy/sweetness of the jalape√±o sauce. It's probably not their healthiest menu item but I definitely recommend it. I would also recommend the tuna tacos and carnitas tacos. For sides the Mexican street corn and shishito peppers are a must have!   Come to Sumomaya if you're looking for a trendy date night spot or an evening out with the girls!"}
{"text":"The only plus about this place is the decor, and location.  Our waitress was absolutely arrogant, smart @ss and rude.  It wasn't until she brought the bill to us was she actually pleasant and didn't make a sly comment.  I also find it interesting that this place is a fusion of Mexican/Asian cuisine but just bc you you put Pork in padthai doesn't mean it should be called al pastor pad Thai.... it's just pork with pad thai.  This is the second time we came here thinking the first time was a fluke for bad experience.... but this second time confirmed it... it's just a cool venue, but the food and service is definitely crummy."}
{"text":"I had a Sunday brunch here and liked the food! I did the $29 brunch which included an entree and bottomless appetizers and desserts. I ordered the enchilada suizas- it had pomegranate seeds in it and it was surpassingly amazing. Although, I liked the food, our waiter seemed to pass by several times without checking in and refilling water, etc. I'd give the food 5 stars but the service a 2! Overall, I'd rate a 3.5!"}
{"text":"I heard so much about this place, and I've been wanted to try...   Food: it is tapas style, or in Japanese izakaya style.  Each portion is small so it will be good if you order about two dishes per person to share with the group.  Everything we ordered was very good, great flavor, nicely presented. Looked yummy and tasted yummy too.  Dates wrapped in bacon: I like the sauce on the dish. Dates and bacon are interesting mix but this sauce nicely mixed together.  Suzuki roll: I liked the smell and taste of slightly deep fried? rice around the roll. Maya roll: Double spicy (spicy tuna and spicy sauce (I think it was wasabi base sauce).  Nonetheless, liked the flavor. Kimuchi fried rice: tasted better than the one I make at home. Smelled the kimuchi but it wasn't overwhelming at all.   Sometimes kimuchi could be strong, but I think the sauce on the dish toned it down to the level the kimuchi was enjoyable. Chinese Chicken salad: nothing fancy... We shared three deserts and all were good.   This place said Mexican Asian fusion but the way they used difference sauce reminded me of French food.  I think they used French dressing for Chinese Chicken salad Nice decor inside, mix of Mexican and Asian. I didn't necessarily loved it but it was certainly interesting for sure.  Service: although it was good but very slow... We were there for lunch and ended up being there for two hours. So if you are in a rush, this place is not good for you. Go there only if you want to enjoy the fun atmosphere with a group of friends to enjoy conversation.  Food was so interesting, I want to come back and try all the rest when I have more time. I like French, Mexican and Asian in general. When combined, it is perfect of all."}
{"text":"We frequently drive by this new trendy restaurant on Scottsdale Rd. We decided to give it a try at lunch. The food was delicious and I would highly recommend the shrimp avocado salad. The ambiance and decor is similar to other restaurants you'll find in Scottsdale. The only reason they don't get 6 stars is due to the service... Our waitress was great, just the time it takes to get your food is longer than you'd like for lunch. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great carefully thought out food, i'd definitely call this cuisine. We had the bar menu, really good pricing. All tacos are amazing! If you're vegetarian the mushroom taco is amazing!!! The cod taco for non meat eaters too! All the tacos are bomb! Raw fish food is respectable and fresh. Shishito peppers are verrry good. Guacamole was just ok, too lemony and sum stale chips in the basket. The calamari is really really good, comes over greens and fresh peas, just ask For the chilli sauce on the side, as mine came drenched and was toooo sweet, it'd be perfect otherwise! Service impeccable, great atmosphere, fun decor down to the fake tree! Well done Sumomaya!!!"}
{"text":"Went here again after Jason P, the manager at Sumomaya, reached out and invited us to come give the place another shot. We were not disappointed. The first visit must have been some kind of fluke because both the food and service were absolutely on point here.   Food: Ceviche del dia- It had a nice acidity, tasted fresh, and was overall very good. Maya Roll- spicy tuna and crispy rice. The tuna was fresh and good quality and the crispy rice was well-balanced. It didn't taste like some crispy rice that I have had in the past where it was overly fried. We also had several nigiri sushi selections and all were fresh, high quality, and delicious.   Drinks: Thai Basil- Rum, lime, thai basil, and pineapple. Money Tamarind- Bulleit rye, tamarind, lime and ginger. Also money  Overall, very nice ambiance, food, drinks, and service. Seems like a great place to go for both happy hour and dinner. Huge thanks to Jason for this wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great concept and amazing staff! The only reason I give it four stars is because it can get quite noisy! Which isn't a bad thing at all but it's not the best place to have a private conversation with someone. Other than that LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"This is the second time to this place. Each time the service and good was superb. Our favorite addicted want more already is the Korean Taco!! Also devoured the tempura shrimp roll and the shakin beef- filet mignonette bites. Divine!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. The food was fast fresh and had a variety of choices for different tastes.   Josh was out server and he had a busy section, however was able to continue to provide us with exceptional service. Thank you Josh we will be back!  Thank you SumoMaya for a fun environment!"}
{"text":"I really love the design and decor of this new restaurant.  Very open feeling and ultra hip place to eat, drink and have fun.  I've had several of the small plates and really like their beer and wine selections.  Their cocktails are also very original and tasty.  My favorite dishes are the shaking beef and the salmon and avocado roll.  The guacamole is great but the chips it comes with can be overly greasy at times.  Parking can be a challenge so go with the free valet if you can't find a parking spot on your own."}
{"text":"Pork belly ramen. The broth was a bit light and didn't have a deep rich flavor. The pork belly was good though but the seaweed taste was a bit overpowering. Less toppings and more of the deep rich flavor from the broth and the seared pork belly would have been better.   I see why people like the Korean Beef tacos. Although the taste of the pickled veggies was way too overpowering and the individual flavors of the beef and most importantly the lack of a Kimchee taste. Don't get me wrong it's a good taco but when I make Korean BBQ beef and kimchee I like to taste the flavors and in combination. I'd call this more of a pickled taco than a Korean beef taco. Although tasting the beef on its own (which is delicious) you really don't get that taste when you eat the whole thing together which is a shame."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely superb! We had calamari, Thai coconut soup (so delicious), miso and some mixed sushi rolls. Just writing this review makes my mouth water!   The jalape√±o margaritas.... BOMB.COM!   The DJ and lighting kept things vibrant.   The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars was our service. Our first time here, we sat for dinner on Christmas Eve and felt ignored by our server the whole night. Eventually enlisting help from the busser after we waited excessively for our drinks and to order food.   We will give this place another shot. Hopefully we had a one off experience because I really want to love this place."}
{"text":"Wonderfully unique bland of Mexican & Asian cuisine. Have eaten here several times and enjoyed it every time. Ambiance in the restaurant is great too."}
{"text":"Such a great concept with the Mexican/Asian infusion. Who doesn't want a roll and guacamole in the same meal?? The crab guacamole was awesome along with the bacon wrapped figs and ceviche special. We ordered almost half the menu and honestly everything was good. Can't remember our waiters name but he was really knowledgeable and gave us a great experience. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Yum! Came here for dinner during the week and had an excellent meal! Fun, trendy ambiance and loud music. We took our baby here and joked that no one would be able to hear her if she cried because it was so loud. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here- great food and good service.   Service: our waitress was super sweet and helpful in navigating the menu and giving us suggestions. We wish that they either provided a stack of small plates or cleared our plates occasionally though because having 1 tiny plate for all the different small meals and flavors wasn't ideal. Also after our meal no one wiped down the table so it was dirty while we were eating dessert. These are minor things but are still misses for an expensive trendy place.  Food: We split:  Guacamole w/ Pomegranate: Unique, good contrast with the sweetness of the dried fruit  Rock Shrimp Tempura: nothing special but tasty  Korean Beef Tacos: I thought these were ok but my husband LOVED them- said they were the best tacos he's had in Scottsdale so far  Suzuki Roll: Fresh clean flavors with a kick- and I loved the rice crispy things on the outside  Shaking Beef: This is the #1 ordered dish here according to our waitress and it was just ok- great flavors but the beef seemed overcooked  Lobster & Crab Dynamite: This was my mom's favorite- very rich!  Chocolate sticky cake w/ salted caramel ice cream: a must if you've saved room! We practically licked the plate clean!"}
{"text":"Very unique dishes with great flavors. One of our favorite spots and there's not a bad thing on the menu. Everything is superb"}
{"text":"If all you want is good food, it's worth trying once. But the prices are a bit outrageous, the service is horrible (rude hostesses, no water refills, empty drink for almost my entire meal, never once asked how our meal was), and they can't seem to decide if they're a hip Scottsdale lounge or sports bar. Was hoping for more."}
{"text":"Yes, quality ingredients and yes, trendy decor but worth the hefty prices? Not sure. We felt a bit like the server was just going through the motions- adequate but not memorable .. Our best service experience was with the valet!! Awesome guy that we tipped even though he never drove our car."}
{"text":"If you can get a reservation, this is a must try spot. Great food, good drinks, good service. Main plates are a bit small, so expect to to share a few. The cuisine combinations are excellent. Very tasty. And lots of local ingredients.   Place is busy and there's music going. So expect it to be a bit loud.  People watching here is also rather entertaining.   Downsides: valet parking in a strip mall, really...? Reservations 2 weeks out.  Positives: Food, drinks and service."}
{"text":"My coworker recommended this place to me few months ago. I went to North Scottsdale last week, so decided to check this place out.  The parking lot is 80% closed by barriers where they have 'complimentary' valet parking.  The indoor deco is cool. But it's so noisy! The bar seats are not moveable, so you need either yell to your friends or lean the whole body towards them. They have TV on, so good for sports fan.  sushi - ordinary, the uni one is not as fresh as other places I have tried. pork belly ramen - great broth, almost the best pork belly I have ever tried in US, however, the noodle is not good at all. It's way too hard as a fully cooked noodle. A mixed seafood dish (forgot the name) - very tiny portion! And pricy! (Compare to the price and portion, it's like a Michelin restaurant food, if you have had one before, but they sever over 7 dishes for one person, do I need to order 7 dishes here at one time?)  But it's Scottsdale, I guess everything is pricy. The sauce is really good, I just hope they can have more.  My coworker is from Mexico, and I'm from China. So she though this place is a great combination. She tried some tuna tacos, and she loves it. They definitely mixed Japanese elements into Mexican, but not the other ways though."}
{"text":"I didn't have high expectations for such an unusual type of fusion food, but I thought SumoMaya was great.  We mostly had Mexican cuisine (ceviche, tacos) all of which was excellent. I deducted a star for our somewhat pretentious server, who didn't write down our order and then forgot two of our dishes.  I reminded him, and then he only brought one of them, then had our table cleared and asked if we wanted dessert. We said no, and as he was walking away, a waiter walked towards our table with our salad (the missing dish).  Our server whispered in his ear and sent him away.  Did he really think we didn't notice/forgot?  The right thing to do would have been to apologize and ask if we still wanted the dish.  Some maturity and grace, rather than trying to save face, would have gone much farther."}
{"text":"They have really interesting dishes. Loved their kimchi fried rice but their sushi pieces were weird. They added special sauces to all of them. Their Korean bbq tacos were delicious. I went for dinner one night and happy hour a few days later, I kind of didn't like that they had a super limited menu during happy hour but it's so cheap it's definitely worth it. I will definitely return when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Considered one of the best sushi restaurants in our area. The big question is why?  I have just been diagnosed answer. It.  Mainly posturing. Show off.  Prices do not make sense relative to appoint or service. There is no justification meeting very dense.  And uncomfortable.   Invested so much money destroying the packaging and technology that have money left to spend comfortable seats.   When I invite friends for sushi table opens Friday at $ 700, I expect to be treated with care.  For the avoidance of doubt.  The food was delicious.  The dishes look like from a catalog.  Everything is designed and colorful.  The problem is that connection.  Treat you as another one.  As a customer, I have not experienced the feeling of vip place like this should give me."}
{"text":"If I ate at the restaurant this probably would have been a higher review - because the restaurant is gorgeous, stylish, and looks like a great time for a young couple.  But I got the food to go.   I wanted desperately to really like this food. Mexican/Asian fusion sounds awesome, their dishes sound great, and it's right up my alley as far as flavors go. We tried 4 things - the bacon-wrapped dates, the suzuki roll, the fried plantains and the Mexican pho.   The bacon-wrapped dates are really, really good. There's not a lot of cheese flavor in them, but it doesn't really matter. The foie gras sauce is perfect with them. I have no idea what these have to do with Asian cuisine or Mexican cuisine, but I don't think I care. The plantains were fine, though a bit underseasoned.  The Suzuki roll was...odd. The flavor itself was somewhat bland, even with the sauce, and the texture of the crust just didn't work. Coming from Seattle I knew that ordering the sushi was going to be a hit or miss thing, but it really just wasn't that great. The big disappointment for me was the pho. I love pho, and I was really hoping for something special here. As it was, it didn't taste like, really, anything special. There was no good anise or meaty flavor that you get from pho, there wasn't any kind of spiciness or interesting flavor like you get from pozole or menudo. The meat was overcooked and tough, the broth a bit bland, and the noodles soggy and not great.   Again, the restaurant itself looks incredible, and  I wouldn't hesitate to bring a date there - don't bring kids, and do dress up. But don't come here just for the food."}
{"text":"So we went for my girlfriend's birthday.  I have to say I was definitely a fan of the open layout.  The kitchen was in full view and the space was definitely utilizing the great weather of Phoenix.  Don't fret if you get a spot outside as there are numerous misters ready to cool you down.  If you do sit by the misters, expect a cool, almost tropical breeze during your meal.  Honestly, the food was pretty good.  We had the chicken tacos which were small but tasty, had the suzuki roll which was the star of the dinner, and a spicy yellow tail roll that was eehhh ok.  The fish isn't amazing but the creative rolls and the atmosphere was fantastic.  Our service was spotty.  They made efforts but they were clearly too busy.  Likely, this issue will clear up as they outgrow their growing pains.  For dessert, we had the chocolate lava cake which was yummy.  The horchata ice cream was a bit icy for our taste but was made up by the juicy cake.  Would try again as the menu was so expansive we couldn't try everything we wanted.  Good business strategy, offering numerous amounts of dishes that you have to try :)"}
{"text":"Visited sumo maya again with some out-of-state guests, they loved the atmosphere and the Chilean sea bass was the melt-in-your-mouth delish that I was hoping for. Great follow up to my last visit."}
{"text":"SumoMaya = the perfect mix of Mexican and Asian in a trendy and fun atmosphere.  I've been several times... each of them was a girls night out, and it's a great destination for that -- especially if your party is into sharing food, enjoying a few drinks, and being entertained by fellow diners and the Scottsdale scene.  This place offers a solid drink menu filled with unique and tasty cocktails, a fabulous selection of wine, beer, and tons of tequila too.  I just now realized that this is likely due to the fact that their Beverage Director is Bill DeGroot, who is no stranger to the Valley's cocktail scene; this guy is quite an expert in his field!  I'm a huge fan of both Mexican and Asian flavors... I totally recommend doing a mix when you go here.  Some of my fave menu items are: -Pomegranate Guacamole -Sumo \"Chopped\" Salad -Korean Beef Tacos -Wild Mushroom Tacos -Shishito Peppers -Miso Eggplant  **And then depending on how adventurous your palate is when it comes to sushi, you can't go wrong with the following basics: -\"Real\" California Roll -Salmon-Avocado -Spicy Tuna  Or if you are feeling like something a little bit more unique when it comes to flavor, go for any of these: -Suzuki Roll: spicy tuna, avocado, masago, chipotle aioli -Apple Salmon Roll -Or any of their other specialty rolls, all of which sound awesome.  I especially look forward to trying both the Billionaire Roll (japanese waygu beef, snow crab, asparagus, soy aioli, truffle garlic butter, gold flake) and the Sumo Green Roll (wood grilled mushrooms, avocado, crispy plantain chip, veg. caviar+ aji amarillo) on a future visit.  The meet and veggies will balance each other out, right?!  The brunch menu looks interesting as well... especially if you're in the mood for bottomless mimosas, micheladas, or bloody mary's with your meal.  I hope to try that sometime!  A couple of things to note to keep expectations in check: SumoMaya is loud... it's difficult to hear everyone if you have a large group, so know that going in.  Also, their tap water tastes a little off... I noticed that on all of my visits.  Perhaps a tool they have to get guests to drink more cocktails?!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place....however this place has changed recently. We used to take all of our friends and out of town guests there. We have been here At least 10 times. This will not be the case anymore. They changed their rolls - not noted on the menu. They charge the same price but they are much smaller with no presentation. They started making many of their menu items very spicy and took out the savory flavors. The plates are small and the beef had 4/7 slices were chewy and edible- this used to not be that way. The first round of drinks were great and the second round had very little - if any alcohol in them. We had a problem with the check at the end (charged $70 for an $18 bottle of saki - this was a \" computer glitch\". Not sure how this happens when the bottle we got was the $18 and the check said the name of the $18 one but was charged the wrong amount?!?) The manager Jason was VERY RUDE and unprofessional. He was came to our table with fires blazing. He gave attitude for an error on their part. He said they would have caught it - really? They already gave us the bill and we're about to take our money and then they get mad at us for asking you to change it! Don't think he was going to chase us down to give us our money back?!? This is No way to treat customers, especially when you are a large party of people who have been loyal customers for a while. You have lost all of our business...and apparently others because this restaurant was not packed like it used it."}
{"text":"Don't eat here. Had the bottomless brunch. Inedible. Sent the sushi back because it was so bad. The food was just bad. The service wasnt much better because the waitress was set up to fail by the management and kitchen. Guacamole without any chips? Check. Desserts coming after the check is even paid? Check. Sides coming before the entrees are even ordered? Check. I barely ate this terrible food and I still feel sick.   Oh, and the room temperature, melted cheesecake may be the most disgusting, unappetizing dessert I've ever seen at a restaurant.   Save your stomach and your wallet and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I visited a second time in the evening and had a great time. The misters were on and it was quiet comfortable. This is a very happening place in the evenings.  I can see my self meeting up with friends here regularly."}
{"text":"The $$ is incorrect. This place is definitely $$$. I loved the atmosphere, decor, and music. However disappointed with the menu and high prices."}
{"text":"Great, diverse menu with a number of excellent \"twists\". We had a number of small plates, from sushi to tacos to Pad Thai. The drink menu had some nice choices as well, utilizing Asian and Latin influences. The coconut cocktail was very sweet, the green tea was refreshing. Excellent service. Comfortable, but somewhat minimalist decor. Really enjoyed SumoMaya. We will return."}
{"text":"Our experience was contrary to some of the previous reviews.  The atmosphere was hopping and a mixed crowd.  We were on the patio where it initially was pretty comfortable considering it was 110 outside.  Unfortunately some nitwit decided that since the sun had gone down it must be cool outside so they raised the shades.  This unfortunately raised the temps to the level that I guess enough people complained and they lowered them back down, but the damage had been done.  Our waiter busted his butt to work our table of 6.  But there was definnitely disconnects between him and the rest of the staff.  It was nearly 15 minutes between the time we got the first entree and the final one.  We had wrong drinks delivered, other table's dishes placed on our table, and when you pay $25 for a few slices of carne asada and some grilled onions, you would at least expect it to be cooked to order.  Instead, rather than the medium rare I ordered, what I received was pretty much well done and had a burnt char taste to it like the grill hadn't been cleaned in a month.  At this point we were pretty much ready to leave the inferno and get the hell out of there.  Might be the place to be seen but if you're looking for cuisine, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I think this place is awesome (among my 3 favorite food spots in the valley).  However, they do have some kinks to work out when it comes to their management and service.  Don't make changes to your menu options too early on, when things seems to be working.  I was very disappointed this evening when I went and asked for the 5 for $5 salsa option, and was told it had been discontinued.  That was an element that distinguished your brand and makes a huge difference on the dining experience - as each sauce could bring an item to life in a different way.  I then asked the server if they had any salsa or hot sauce...she offered me Siracha.  This was fine - but to market yourself as an upscale mexican - asian fusion restaurant, and not offer any fresh made salsas is very odd.  At least offer something original in the salsa department, if you don't want to make all 5 of those sauces.  Don't take shortcuts with the clientele you are marketing to, I can assure you it will not end well here."}
{"text":"The brunch deal is amazing for a Sunday Funday outing. Some friends and I got together here for our bestie's birthday brunch. For $29, you get all you can eat small plates and desserts, PLUS one entr√©e. For an additional $10, you get bottomless mimosas (they have several flavors like passionfruit, pineapple, blood orange and traditional) or bloody marys.   If you are planning on spending time day-drinking, mingling and having a good time with your pals, this offer is hard to beat.   The wait staff is friendly and on the ball (considering there were about 20 of us in the party, I can tell you that keeping all the glasses filled was no small feat, but they handled it like pros!) A few stand out plates were: 3 leches cr√®me brulee oatmeal (OMG!), pork al pastor pad thai (a reallllllllly good-sized portion...it was enough to feed two \"kinda hungry\" people), and the guacamole. The cinnamon orange French toast was also pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Wow so glad I gave this place another try!   To start we had the pomegranate guacamole...yum! We next had the Avocado roll and the chicken Tinga tacos they were both wonderful.  The best thing hands down was Coconut Thai soup, it was creamy, spicy and full of flavor much like a panang curry sauce!   Service was phenomenal! Victoria was an absolutely amazing server! She was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and  recommended the off menu vegetarian roll. Omg it was fabulous please try it out when you go. It has avocado roasted peppers apple. The patio was a wonderful spot to sit it really added to the wonderful experience."}
{"text":"We spent the weekend in Phoenix/Scottsdale and wanted sushi for dinner. We picked a few places and asked our Uber driver if he knew of either. He was familiar with both but insisted we tried SumoMaya. So happy he did because it was absolutely delicious. The shishito pepper roll was my favorite thing but I also loved the tuna tacos and whatever noodle bowl we had. Truly the best meal we had all weekend and we wish we would have gone back for brunch!"}
{"text":"We went to SumoMaya for happy hour looking for a late lunch. We went at 2:00 and they don't offer the regular menu till 4:00. We have never been to SumoMaya before but decided to give the happy hour a shot. Wow, it did not disappoint! The food was so good and flavorful! We ordered the guacamole, that they make right when you order it. We also got the calamari, which had peas and chili sauce mixed with it but all the flavors meshed well. The burger was fantastic and the chicken enchilada suizas were my favorite. They were so light for enchiladas, which is nice for lunch. Overall everything was amazing and I would love to come back one day to try the full menu."}
{"text":"great concept and fun place to take out of town guests. I like the sushi and chopped salad the best but everything we tried was good. the portions are not huge so taking my husband is not the best idea- he needed a cheeseburger on the way home. Perfect for a girls lunch or happy hour though!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch. Definitely come with a group because you'll want to try everything on the menu and unless you are a professional eater, there's no way you can tackle this alone. The concept is great- $29 for unlimited shared plates and desserts + an entree. Add $10 for bottomless drinks. With a deal this great, I worried that the food would be meh and the drinks bad, but boy was I wrong.  Drinks - 5 different mimosa flavors, I can vouch for the blood orange version. Served in a wine glass that is refilled as soon as it empties. - Bloody Mary- subdued garnish compared to some of the over-the-top meals-in-a-glass elsewhere, but the drink itself was really good in terms of strength and spice.  Starters - Mexican sweet breads- 3 different flavors, loved that they cut these into small pieces so that I could try them all and not fill up. - 3 leches oatmeal brulee- this was my fave!! It came with a cup of sweet milk to pour over the top, it took this dish over the top! - fruit/yogurt/granola- The melon wasn't super sweet, but the berries were good. And it was nice to have something on the light side - Black bean hummus- yum! nice and creamy. I'm not a plantain chip fan, but these beans were good on their own and with the eggs... - Huevos revueltos- Loved these, too, especially with a bit of the bean hummus. - Bread migas- I'm not a chorizo fan, so these weren't mind fave. - Guacamole- topped with pomegranate seeds- yum. I suggest not filling up on the tostada chips - Sushi rolls- fine, but not may fave given all the other fab food on the table.  Full yet? Don't be. There's still more to come. You get to select an entree - B ordered the Cuban breakfast sandwich- it's a lot of meat, but very tasty. - Waffle- the menu said sweet potato with bananas, but I think what I had was actually a blueberry waffle with a side of mixed berries. No matter, it was delish. I topped with a bit of flavored whip cream that I stole from my friend's son (I think it came with his french toast?)  Side Dishes- I can't speak to these because we didn't order any. That's probably a good thing, because though they sound tasty, with the 11 of us, there was more than enough food on the table already.   Dessert- If you make it this far, you may be close to the limit, but save room for at least a taste of each of these. - Bunuelos- cinnamon crisps drizzled with dulce de leche. Sweet, so just a bite is enough. Would be great with a cup of coffee - Liquid cheesecake with berries- tasted like a soft version of cheesecake filling.   The place fills up, so make a reservation. Even though it's crowded, service is great and the energy positive (helped by some pumping music). Definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Place is awesome. Food is also good. Service sucks and what ever you do look at your bill.   We went there with another couple . My good friends pick up the tab.  After paying we left that night they told us the bill was 345.00.  WTF.   We went over what we ordered cause we had a menu the bill with drinks came to 165.00.      Really 2 lady's 2 men. How much food can we eat.   We got a total of 5 dishes.   1 drink each."}
{"text":"Love this place most of the time. But it's 103 and 4:30 close to empty and management decides to open all doors and windows for the crowd that is not here yet, the restaurant 105 degrees now.  Check please.... Yep going to wait until the cool weather comes to come back.  And please manager you need to buy the crowd that is here an app or drink for endearing the heat that is proper etiquette. Check......"}
{"text":"This place is fun, unique and a cool concept. The drinks were delightful but the food was even better. We tasted so many items on the menu and we're happy with all of the selections!"}
{"text":"Don't eat their poached eggs!  Ate them and had the worst food poisoning of my life!  Their cooked food is good though. Decor and ambiance is what you pay for really and a messed up stomach!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday this weekend and had a great time, thanks to the excellent service and food! There was a group of 8 of us and we wanted to try a bunch of food so we had the server (Kellen) bring out whatever he thought would be best and everything turned out to be amazing!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service Maren! You were great! And as usual, the food was impeccable. Drinks amazing. Will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant on many an occasion. Tonight I wanted to highlight how wonderful our waitress Nina was. She instantly recognised us from a previous time and her attention to detail and service was outstanding. I am from the industry and appreciate good service. I had the ceviche but warn it is incredibly spicy. Too much for my liking. This should be pointed out on the menu. My friends had another type of ceviche and the same problem. My Vietnamese shaken beef was delightful.  Can't wait to return"}
{"text":"A great place to have tapas style food. Every time I have been there I have had a good time. Can't get better guac anywhere."}
{"text":"Amazing food amazing staff was not let down and how I love Mexican sushi! I highly recommend this this style of sushi personally it's better than your traditional boring flavors."}
{"text":"The ambiance is modern, fun and interesting; 3 stars for that alone.  The food and service lack.  Upon walking in, two people at the hostess stand kind of looked at us dumbfounded.  Finally the girl said, \"2?\" We said we'd go to the bar.  Went for happy hr. to try it out before committing to a full-on meal; sat at the bar, yet weren't given or even offered the Happy Hr. menu. Asked the bartender, she then accommodated. She didn't come back to ask how our food was until the plates were empty! And it was pretty dead in there on a Tues. afternoon so she wasn't swamped helping servers or her own customers.  We ordered 2 diff. kinds of tacos; fish and chicken. I thought they were pretty flavorless, hubby liked the (fried) fish ones.  Drinks are very pricey ($8 for a Jack and water, even during HH) and with so many good restaurants in Scottsdale alone, we will not be returning for dinner or anything else after this visit.    Sad, cuz the restaurant itself is so cool inside and we really wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Very Impressed. I was able to make a reservation for My Birthday for 8 people and then when more people came they were very accommodating. The server was completely on point and the manager was also amazing. My steak Thai salad was so good. I will be back there for sure. Excellent signature drink selection as well."}
{"text":"Wow, I had the Arroz Con Pato, amazing dish. The chef who thought of it should be awarded. Also had a hand roll and Korean Beef tacos, good also but not worth writing home about."}
{"text":"Brunch was amazing! Bottomless mimosas and food was incredible!   Try the sausage fried rice & guac!"}
{"text":"The mango habanero sauce/salsa thing is #bombdotcom. A hint of sweetness at first with a huge lingering kick. A very balanced combination of both. Food was a good mix of interesting and different flavors. The size is smaller (almost like tapas) so it is easier to try numerous menu items. Pricing is moderate. A bit pricy for some items but def nothing outrageous.    The staff was friendly and attentive, though that may be because we arrived shortly after they opened for the day. Didn't have to contend with too many other customers at the time which was a huge bonus.  Seeing as the restaurant is new, there were a few execution issues I noticed with our meal. The sea bass was overly seasoned and I kept looking for something to help cut the saltiness. The garnishes on the plate didn't help much in that respect. The overall flavor and concept of the dish was nice though. Def would try again.Their sushi was beautifully presented but wasn't rolled (or packed, since the pieces were square) very tightly. It often fell apart as we tried to pick them up. Aside for these couple of items, it was a nice experience.  HH daily so I'll def be back."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere. This place is alive, with fun, friendly and fast service. Cocktails are unique and we'll crafted. Tacos, sea bass, sushi...just get everything!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour great, but not available at tables. You can sit at the bar (not great for group conversation) or be miserable at an outside table in the summer heat.  Tons of open tables that we would be able to vacate for dinner crowd or even order off main menu. But they do not honor happy hour prices at a table. Great menu is over shadowed by restrictions. Stay away in summer, maybe will try again when the outside weather is great."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere but was taken aback when we couldn't get a table despite most tables being empty for over an hour. Good guacamole and good happy hour cocktails but service was a little spotty at the bar ."}
{"text":"Interesting unique dishes, excellent service, and fun decor!   My friend and I stopped here on the way home from a cycle class at CycleBar. We were both pretty hungry!  The place was not too busy on a Sunday morning at around 11/11:30 am but suspect it's packed later in the day/evening.   The decor was fun and interesting with brightly colored pillows and cushions on the booths.    Our waitress was attentive and detailed with the menu information.  I had decided on an omelet that included mushrooms. The waitress let me know that the mushrooms are very smoky and to make sure I really liked the smoky flavor (I do not). So, instead, she was able to let me make a custom made veggie-omelet. It was so good; it included mushrooms (not smoked), spinach, and tomatoes.   My friend ordered one of the sushi dishes and the duck/green tea waffle combination.   She enjoyed all of her food.   I suspect the parking could be an issue later in the day/evening. This is in a tight shopping center, with apartments to the north."}
{"text":"Very interesting fusion! They have a great brunch menu and great laid back atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing! To start, we had the seared tuna and guc w squash and other mix in.  We had the lobster mango roll and spicy crab roll.  It was the best sushi I've ever had.  Then we had Mari Mari tacos which were also out of this world. Delicious unique cocktails too and fair pricing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.  Fad food.   Service is abysmal. Club kids comparing notes about the prior night on the town and a sushi chef comparing different rolls to the size of his, and his coworkers penis. His co worker is the shorter but fatter roll in case you were interested.  I'd rather just have a server that pays attention.    Food is a cool idea of fusing Mexican and Asian but the execution falls way short and diminishes the concept. Why put two great things together if they outcome is going to be sub-par?  Kind of what like Martin Sheen would say.     Had a bagel with lox fusion concept that was just a straight up mess on the plate. Somehow it remained boring even though It was complicated and overdone.  In the end it's a gimmick and doesn't have legs. Scottsdale people will think it's awesome for about another year and they'll come up with a new fad for you.   I say go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Fantastic!   We checked it out for happy hour and I'm hooked!   The restaurant is beautiful and the menu has a great variety.   We tried the guacamole,  mushroom tacos and chicken tacos.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  I don't like super sweet drinks so the bartender suggested a coconut cocktail.  She actually made it less sweet than usual and it was perfect.   Delicious food, great drinks and fabulous happy hour prices.  What else can a girl ask for?!?  Looking forward to next time!"}
{"text":"As Jorden H outlined, I also came here a few weeks ago for my first time for my Birthday brunch. It was our first time in, even made a reservations.  It was pretty slow for a Saturday due to the US Open going on that weekend in Scottsdale. The food was amazing! It's the service that is lacking there of.  We didn't even get our first two appetizer plates ordered or 1 bottomless drinks (Mamosa) until 55 minutes after the server took the order and again there where many MANY open seating due to the US OPEN.  Once our drink finally came (also being there for over two hours with only getting one bottomless drink) my fianc√© blatantly told the server that we would be putting in ALL of our orders regardless of the two item at a time ordering outline since it is taking an hour to get anything out.  Our server did have a bigger party table when we first arrived, however it seemed them and us were the only tables she was attending too at that time.  The staff needs to communicate more in regards to their server and capabilities needs when taking on larger parties (not giving other tables if not bale to handle both). Also a bit disappointing making a Birthday brunch reservation without any acknowledgment."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Must try the dragon roll, Korean beef tacos, and Mexican street corn. Be prepared to drop at least $75 a person on food and drinks though. A bit pricey. I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because it's like eating in a night club if you go at night. So loud. Skip this place if you're going on a first date! Otherwise, love it!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour,specialty drinks are very good,try them all!!"}
{"text":"Food--interesting combinations and flavors! Loved the bacon-wrapped dates and enjoyed the Korean Beef tacos as well as the Pork Belly sushi roll.  My favorite item was the Sizzling Chaufa Rice--such unique flavors!  Not very happy with the lobster ceviche (a bit tough and no crisps or bread or chips to scoop it up with) and very disappointed with the Pina Colada dessert (tough pineapple and cake was small and rubbery; coconut sorbet was yummy though and they did take it off the menu).  Finally, the margaritas were so small and two of them in succession did not even get me a little bit buzzed (for $24 I expect some jazz).  The atmosphere is cool -- love the tree but it's very loud after 7 pm when Sir Mix-A lot starts playing the tunes (Saturday) and the hard plastic chairs are horrible!  Our service was fine but I thought the food came out a bit quickly.  Overall, I can't really say I'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The food (loved the Japanese/Mexican blend) is wonderful and the service is super nice, accomodating and friendly.  Strongly recommend you go there now!"}
{"text":"Went there for their famous brunch on Saturday...have to say we were not disappointed! The brunch set up is unlimited starters for the table,  an entree and unlimited sides and dessert. We tried most of the starters and weren't disappointed! The bread migas, the oatmeal, black bean hummus dip and the guacamole. We were not disappointed! As for entrees we had the following:  The chicken enchilada suizas....im not usually a fan of the verde sauce but this was delish  Huevos Rancheros, the dish did not disappoint the sauce and tortilla were good!  Churro Waffle, it was a cinammon waffle topped with a choclate ice cream that was a hint of spicy...tasty!  Torta ...not as excited about this entree. There was more to meat. Can't say we will be getting that one next time.  The blood orange mimosa and passion fruit mimosas were just right.  Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, amazing food. Couldn't have been a better experience! We started at the bar for a couple of drinks, then moved on to sushi at a table. Our waiter was wonderful and very helpful and the food was fantastic."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere! I tried it while in town on vacation. Tried the white ceviche- and it was DELICIOUS! Also had several sushi rolls. I will definitely come back next time I visit."}
{"text":"Editing my old review and changing to 4 stars because I tried it again and the service was much better! Thank you SumoMaya, your food is amazing"}
{"text":"LOVE going there on Sundays for bottomless mimosas and you can chose from 4 different kinds I do believe. If you go there, I recommend the edamame and the street corn. The sushi is great as well. Johnathon is an amazing bar tender as well if you go by yourself and want some great conversation."}
{"text":"What?  Pomegranate guacamole?  Yes and let me tell you, if you get nothing else get the guac. It was loaded with apricots and clementines and pomegranate.  A hint of jalape√±o and all delicious. We could have licked the bowl clean. The rest of the menu was tapas style and came out in drips and drabs. The shrimp from the grill was spicy and tasty but you got two. There's a whole drink menu filled with spicy and fruity concoctions.  Again get the guac"}
{"text":"Meh.   Awkward menu. Fun environment. Great for cocktails!  If you go for JUST cocktails, you will be happy."}
{"text":"Imaginative, cool decor, high ceilings. Music, however was loud and intense driving it more toward bar than restaurant feel. Waitstaff were great, attentive and cooperative. Food was delicious and they pulled off the Mexican-Japanese fusion well. The only bump was the crab chili ramen, which was a one note affair tasting of ramen, Siracha and that overpowered the crab. More veggies, scallions, ginger, onions would have rounded it out into a multilayered taste. The Mexican corn was removed from the cob, a nice step making eating easier, but the plain popcorn garnish was cute but would have benefited from a complimentary taste such as cayenne powder, cheese, etc. The tempura rock shrimp was tasty, as were the bacon wrapped dates in going gras sauce. The pork pad Thai was great. Overall a neat experience."}
{"text":"Awesome. Super delicious. I consider myself a Mexican food snob, and I never would have guessed Chinese mexican together would become an addiction.. those shishito  pepper things I literally eat almost every day at home. Then I had the pleasure of going there for brunch the other day. So good again. A must try"}
{"text":"Anyone who does not love this innovative, delicious restaurant does just not like to eat. Great food! Awesome service. Spectacular atmosphere!!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant!   Our table shared rock shrimp, edamame, and guacamole. The rock shrimp was packed with flavor, not too spicy, and cooked perfectly.  The edamame was flavorful and had a unique taste compared to others. The guacamole was fresh and well-made but they were a bit stingy with the chips-- luckily, our waitress brought out more when we finished the first basket.   The entrees are served tapas style, so the dishes come out when they're ready. If your group is going to order separate entrees instead of sharing, you should expect to be eating at different times/paces depending on what you order. I got the seared Scottish salmon. It was served in a broth with a spoon-- it was very good, cooked perfectly, and again had a unique flavor.   The atmosphere here is very fun and trendy, the decor is adorable and there's music playing- it's the perfect spot for a girl's night out or a date night."}
{"text":"This is one of our families favorite places ever!  Food is unbelievable and the atmosphere is really hip and cool.  This is a place to spoil yourself because it will be a pricey meal."}
{"text":"We had the endamame, sushi, Korean fried rice, mushrooms and dessert. Each dish was tasty and very flavorful. Service was great. The place has a great vibe. Coffee and dessert were also really great."}
{"text":"Broccolini was choice. Fresh guac, yummy tacos. Skip the asparagus next time. Didn't care for the lobster dynamite. It came with nothing to scoop as it was essentially a dip inside a lobster shell. Chairs were weird with the faces on them. Great for funny instagram pix tho .  Would return, service was EXCELLENT."}
{"text":"Wow what a great concept! If you love Mexican and sushi and don't want to choose, this is the place for you. And me. The place is open and inviting, colorful and fun. The happy hour pricing is fair. We tried the tacos and a roll, both were good. Drinks were very tasty and service was great. A little loud but it open to the outside so the concept is great."}
{"text":"Surprisingly different! The food was very tasty and satisfying. It is primarily a restaurant then a bar. The only thing I would suggest is to look into the portion size on the ceviche, it only had 5 shrimps. Besides that it was great."}
{"text":"Ate here for Father's Day. The place was fairly full. We were told we could sit outside on the patio, wait about 40 minutes, or sit at a counter facing the kitchen. We chose the counter. Our server was obviously quite busy, yet she was pleasant and efficient. Because it was a holiday we were only able to order from a brunch menu. We all chose the same dish, an omelet with crab, red onion, and avocado. The food was tasty although it seemed to take quite some time to be served. The presentation was nicely done. I had hoped to order fried chicken skins but I will have to come back for them. Overall, I'd rate this place an 8 out of 10."}
{"text":"We loved it. The food and drinks were all excellent and our waiter Josh was very helpful and knowledgeable. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch.  We had such a great relaxing brunch here this IS our favorite place. The atmosphere is great with the indoor-outdoor dining. They even have a tree inside.  The food well I can't say enough!! It's the best.  We started with the spicy tuna roll. It was topped with deep fried shrimp!   You must try the green tea waffles sooooo yummy. I had the adobo shrimp, avocado and crab salad.  It also was so refreshing.  Oh yes and the coconut martini definitely a must!  You can't go wrong with anything on this menu."}
{"text":"Called here to get a reservation for 9 people at 4:31pm, was going to reserve it but had to double check with my friends. I call and they said that they have a reservation for 8:00pm, get there at 8:20 pm and amazingly we are too late for our reservation? We have a party of 9 people and I would expect a little leeway for 20 minutes. We ended up going to another place down Scottsdale road (Saporro) and they were able to seat us and our total bill was like $1200.00+ a 20% tip so sumo Maya missed out but maybe have better service next time."}
{"text":"I really liked Sumomaya for lunch that I am already planning to come for brunch since I've read so many great reviews about brunch. Why I've never visited up to this point is beyond me! I like the theme, but the only con I have is that the table was really low so I couldn't really cross my legs. Who cares, right? Well, I do think you should feel comfortable eating and I feel more comfortable crossing my legs as I eat.   I ordered the Korean beef tacos and the Mexican corn and they did not disappoint! Delicious! I'm coming back! It's already on my calendar..."}
{"text":"Fun and contemporary place. I love the fact that the menu is tapas style. This allows you to try a variety of items instead of just one plate. We tried a couple of sushi rolls, mini tacos and pad thai. It was all delicious and atmosphere of the restaurant was energetic.   I strongly recommend this place. It's fun to visit once in awhile and I'm sure the patio will be the place to be once the weather cools down a little more."}
{"text":"My friend came into town from Portland, and she wanted to meet someplace with my husband, brother and I. I had passed this place repeatedly and decided to take a chance on this place for an early dinner. We went for Happy Hour partially.  Overall opinion: Although *some* of the dishes were delicious, the amount we paid for the meal did not feel equal to the amount we received in service or food and drink. Also, Happy Hour is definitely not a great steal either. Save your money, and go to a place that has substance in food quality and staff. This is a restaurant that looks very nice in ambiance and makes it feel like it's a hip, trendy spot, but the actual experience leaves you empty inside.  When we first entered the establishment, there were two girls standing at the hostess table just staring at us as they continued tinkering with some knobs/some kind of device at the front. Let me preface first that the restaurant was empty; there were only a few people at the bar. My husband and I had to greet them and ask them about a table before they half-heartedly asked us to try to find a seat at the bar or a high table top. There were four of us, and the high tables were not large enough to accommodate even our waters and the small happy hour menus - let alone giving us large dinner menus or even accommodate any appetizers. We had to put the menus on a nearby chair, and when we finally got our order in for the alcohol, there was some commotion happening next to us where a server randomly shouted to her peer, \"You better not f---in' do that to me again,\" and started banging around some empty pitchers/slamming things on the server station. We then suggested to our server that we didn't think the table given to us was a suitable space to eat so she said she would find a table, and the girls in the front seemed irritated and reluctant to get us an actual dinner table.  The food was okay and the portion sizes were small compared to the price you were paying. We tried to take advantage of Happy Hour prices, so we grabbed an order of the Spicy Tuna Hand Roll (came in 4 pieces), the Tekka Maki roll (came in 6 pieces), a plate of charred edamame, a handful of crispy calamari and 5 Grilled Chicken Wings. What I will say is that the flavor on all of the above was great. The sushi rolls had this perfect, light vinegary taste to the actual seaweed, which brought a little more flavor to an otherwise boring Tekka Maki roll. The Spicy Tuna was suggested to us, but it was honesty the most bland and forgettable of the ones we ordered. Everything else was good, but we spent too much on these tiny dishes - as an example, almost $10 on only 5 chicken wings and $8 on a tiny handful of lightly sauced calamari.  The food was equally disappointing where we thought if we were paying for two tuna tacos or two Korean beef tacos that they would be full sized tacos. They were $9 for two, and the portion sizes were mini tacos! The garlic noodles was $16 and it came in this large bowl but it was the portion size smaller than my fist. The chile-crab garlic noodles and the ginger fried rice were both bland. The crab had no flavor.  Our waitress was nice and checked on our drinks occasionally. The guy that brought us our food was friendly as well. I really did not appreciate that we \"disrupted\" the hostesses at the front.  Honestly, I don't think we will be coming back here again, but if you HAVE to go because it's mandatory, I would say to stick to the appetizer menu."}
{"text":"Very creative menu, makes me want to come back and try more. Good guacamole, loved the sesame tacos and the street corn is a must."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today. Incredible experience! The bottomless brunch is the best deal in town and the food is great. We had almost everything in the menu and it was all very very good. The only negative would be the Cuban sandwich which comparative to everything else was just okay. Our server was Josh - he was great!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Sumo Maya for the first time last week to celebrate my brother's birthday and it was fantastic!  The atmosphere and d√©cor was awesome, very lively...the perfect place to celebrate a birthday...the food was unique and delicious.  It was fun tasting all the different appetizers.  Their guacamole is amazing and so is their corn.  All the entrees were delicious as well.  Overall we had a great experience and will definitely return."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!! Highly suggest pomegranate guacamole and coconut tha√≠ soup. Such a unique setting.  Every waiter I've gotten has been excellent. The only questionable trait is can be loud especially   on Fridays."}
{"text":"There is a lot going on at SumoMaya which mostly is good.  We had a party of 6 and it was lateish for lunch but the staff seemed pretty accommodating.  My husband and I had early dinner plans and had joined 2 other couples for this outing kind of just to get out and about in Phoenix.  It seemed at first tlike we weren't going to get the best service but once we all got settled our server was on top of everything...and my anxiety of not getting to our dinner at another friends house went down.    Anyway, the decor is really fun, bright colors and patterns, eclectic and cool with a lot of the latest (ghost chairs, ethnic striped backs for the booths, wood and metal) accents.  Two really cool decor items are the breathable walls made of faux ivy and the mirrors in the bathrooms made out of succulents.  Really fun. The food was amazing.  We didn't eat a lot (early dinner) but we tried everything the table ordered.  Two of the best:  Rock Shrimp Tempura and Shaking Beef.   It's lively and fun which always makes for a better experience with friends."}
{"text":"While not cheap. always a good meal and good time. The menu has alot of variety so you can pretty much try something new every time you go there. I love the shishito peppers."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. My fianc√© and I have been here at least 5 times so this isn't a review just based on one bad experience. When SumoMaya first opened, we went and loved it so much that we brought his family for my birthday dinner. Then we brought our friends to try it. It was great! Then we went for lunch one day. Got chicharone guac, always good. The chips they serve with their guacamoles are awesome. I got Pad Thai, he got the chicken sandwich. My lunch was gross....no other way to describe it. Weird flavor a but figured maybe it wasn't for me. His sandwich was ok, fries were very good. The last time we went we brought my cousin and his fianc√©e. To be honest it was almost embarrassing. The only consistent thing here anymore is the guacamole. All the dishes we'd had previously that were amazing just came out \"eh\". Under seasoned, not fresh....super disappointing. I wish they could have kept up what they started with, at this point I'm not interested in ever going back. Not a cheap risk to take."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Love the ambiance and food. The food is delicious! The happy hour is awesome. I go alone, went with a friend, and a group. Food was always great! And drinks were even better"}
{"text":"They do a good job, a lot of interesting combinations, fun  atmosphere..."}
{"text":"This is a fun place. Great people watching and a great happy hour deal. Love the Decor. But don't trust them for a reservation. Twice I've made reservations and both times I was told I hadn't.  Beware."}
{"text":"The food is good but the portion size is very small and left me feeling pretty ripped off. After spending $100 on dinner we had to go somewhere else to eat afterwards because we were still hungry. The place is extremely loud, which I don't mind because the music was good but it's kind of annoying when the waitress can't hear anything you say.  Overall, I'd say I won't be back and wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I felt like the brunch was overrated. The quality of food was lacking for $29 a person, not to mention the unlimited drinks for $10. You aren't able to switch between beverages on the list, so if one drinks mimosas, you drink the mimosas the entire time. They tasted like Andre with a watered down juice mixture.   The food was not unique or satisfying. We ordered sushi rolls which ended up being pretty much vegetarian with the minute slice of salmon in one piece. As for the entrees, I can make better hollandaise sauce at home. The dessert was, however, satisfying- a creamy uncaramelized creme br√ªl√©e wth fresh fruit.  When looking at quality vs quantity, SumoMaya fails in both areas. This is a place where they want you to think it's high class with the prices, but don't waste your money."}
{"text":"This place seems to have disruptive power politics going on.  The hostess set a bad tone. She let me know that the place was still in happy hour, informed me that the bar and high top tables where available, but didn't really take control of the situation. I expected her to gesture for me and read that this was probably my first time there and I was a bit disoriented. I had to search for the high tables. (Pro tip: they are behind the massive bar that's flanked by a partition wall.) Unfortunately, when the rest of my party arrived they got the same standoffish greeting.  Our waitress was better but still didn't impress us. When she sat us down she didn't bring menus, then she brought us the wrong happy hour menus, and I had to ask to be moved to a normal table. She said she had to ask front desk if my group of four could be moved. I have two questions: 1. How does this place think one of their high tables is appropriate for four at dinner? 2. Why can't our server make the decision on what's best for her patrons?  The food? Surprisingly good but the portions where small. $16 for a cylindrical ice cream scoop of flavored rice with an egg on top? Pathetic.  If you're going to take a lady or gentleman out do not pick this spot. Drive to Old Town and get yourself some decent service and priced food.  The bar tenders where great though!"}
{"text":"Have been for dinner as well as brunch on the weekends.  Just bare in mind that the menus are quite different.  Only a few a the items from dinner are offered at brunch. Food has very unique flavor combinations and all of it works! Atmosphere is loud and trendy.  One thing I don't get is the need for them to give impression of false exclusivity and demand.  The first time we were there was for an early dinner around 5:00pm.  When we walked in, we told the hostess we would like a table for two.  She didn't ask if we had a reservation, but instead insisted that the only seats available were at the sushi bar because they had so many reservations.  Fine, no problem.  However, in the hour that we were there, the majority of the tables remained empty.  They obviously make a habit of this, because a friend said the same thing happened to them.  Don't know why they feel the need to do this, but it's very annoying."}
{"text":"This place is really fun! I noticed people were celebrating bachelorette and birthdays here. There's loud music (via a Dj), young crowd, good drinks, and great service. The food is pretty good, but expensive. Get used to paying $10 for two tiny tacos! Hahaha! The wagyu hot stone beef was delicious, filet mignon was SO tender, loved their twist on pad thai, and I liked my spicy peach drink too. Totally recommend especially if you're trying to impress someone or if it's a special day. Just make reservations in advance because they get booked out."}
{"text":"Make me smile. Aside from the 1970 classic Chicago tune (yes.... some people were actually around at that time!) these words are the ultimate compliment that I can pay to a chef and a restaurant. There are only a few places in the Valley that bring a smile to my face and relaxation to my brain. Sumo Maya is one of them. Chefs Matt Zdeb and Andy Suzuki are so incredibly skilled at what they do that even in the midst of this active atmosphere, I can take deep breaths and relax. The Kimchee Fried Rice (with firm grilled shrimp added as an option), and Arroz Con Pato have never missed a step and always provided just the right combo of all things tasty. The Crispy Calamari and the Bacon Wrapped Medjool Dates are just stupidly good.  German, Tai, Eli and Alex keep the engine purring and customers on top of their priority list. Even on this busy night (last  night, other businesses in the same area were having their own special events and parking was crowded), the smile was there. For those who have enjoyed this experience before, these observations really aren't that new. For those who have had less than a wonderful experience and especially those who have not yet been able to make the trip, I strongly recommend that you give this place a shot at earning your business and a happy face.  Peg and I smile a lot here.... Dr. B."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Arizona, I always have at least one dinner with my dad.  Usually it's at a place around the corner from his house, sometimes it's at a sushi restaurant, sometimes the AYCE Brazilian BBQ.   This time he picked SumoMaya, and I am so glad he did.  It seemed really out of place in a business park, but once inside I decided it was one of the best restaurant layouts I've ever seen.  There was a (fake) tree right behind our table, and the whole restaurant was open to the outside lights, yet enclosed so it wasn't too hot.  The kitchen was also open so you could see them making the food.  Our server was super friendly and helped us pick out some dishes.  I have to say literally everything that was put on our table was amazing.  We've dined at SushiSamba before and you can tell the chef came from there, as some of the dishes seemed to come from there.  Our favorite was the tuna tacos, of which we ended up ordering another round at the end of the meal.  I just can't say enough good things about this place.  Even the basic sushi rolls were amazing.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Had my first lunch here today and it was wonderful.  From the friendly hostess and the efficient waitress, to the delicious lunch, it could not have gone better.  I loved the pork al pastor pad thai, and also got a taste of the tamarind shrimp.  Both were excellent, and the temperature was perfect.  The other three people at my table also thoroughly enjoyed their lunch, and none of them had been here either.  The only thing I would change was the loud music at lunch which made it a little more difficult to have a business meeting.  Nobody else complained about the volume, so it may just be me.  It sucks getting old.  It's certainly not for sissies."}
{"text":"So. Very. Loud.   Went here on a Friday night for some sushi rolls. Both my date and I thought the staple spicy tuna-type selections were more flavorful than the specialty rolls we got.   Not sure if the price was worth it for a meal that left a lot to be desired, and an atmosphere where I could barely hear myself think. I feel like this place was trying so hard to be the cool kid it was overcompensating on all the wrong things. Maybe it was an 'off' night."}
{"text":"We happened to visit this restaurant for a friends birthday. My first impression was WoW! the ambience is definitely top notch. I loved the decor and the total look of the restaurant. Its a great place for get together as well as date nights. It can get pretty loud with groups and music.   We ordered couple of cocktails and it was alright. We also ordered some sumo rolls, like lobster mango, salmon, california roll, veggie roll. All were good, the rice, meat and the sauces blended well. I loved the presentation and couldnt stop clicking pictures. We thought one entree would work for two people after all the appetizers, but was surprised on the quantity, it wouldn't have worked for even one person.   Quantity is below average and the price is definitely on the higher end."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 8 for dinner. Not only was the food delicious but the service was excellent. They were very accommodating, suggested items to share, and very knowledgeable on their menu. We ended up with about 15 different dishes and shared everything and it was all good. The only drawback  is that it is really noisy and it is difficult to hear conversations. I would suggest that the restaurant put noise dampeners in the ceilings to help reduce the noise level. In looking at the clientele, you could tell that this was the place to be. I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I must say everything was great! My friend got the spicy yellowtail rolls & an assortment of tacos; one Korean beef, one wild mushroom, and one Al Pastor. I got the miso sesame eggplant, and the Al Pastor & Korean beef tacos. My friend and I both easily agreed, the food was awesome and we had nothing but positive things to say! Cool looking place too! Very open feeling to it inside. The bartender Jeremy was extremely helpful & just all around a nice guy! Great food, service, & location! See y'all soon..."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here the other night for dinner and fully enjoyed it. Our bartender Sarah I believe her was her name was knowledgable, friendly, and attentive. She went over the menu with us and explained many of the dishes and offered different suggestions from many view points. We went with 2 of her suggestions and both dishes were amazing.  We went on Monday night and it was full but food came out at a very timely fashion. I would and have suggested this to other people.   Thanks Sumo Maya for the great food and experience :)"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant. Everything here is amazing. It's a bit pricey but for the quality it is worth it. I got the al pastor pad Thai, the guacamole. The mixed greens salad, some sushi. We ate family style and everything was 100000. I can't wait to go back it was so amazing. I want to try other menu items because I'm so impressed with how good my first experience was. I heard it becomes night clubby- at night so keep that in mind. Also their brunch is bottomless!!!!"}
{"text":"The tacos are really good here but a bit pricy. The happy hour is the best for the price especially the tacos."}
{"text":"Trendy fusion restaurant that has a good vibe if you want to drink and be seen. We ordered several dishes and they were very hit or miss. Most of the dishes were doused in oil and sauce which ruined the ingredients. If you're trying to dine for dinner your probably need a reservation as the place gets packed. The service was pretty good which I've come to expect from most restaurants at this price point in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this new and trendy Asian Fusion Restaurant. My husband and i met a friend there in the early afternoon. The place was not busy, the decor is modern and fun however, the music was so loud you couldn't think. We asked the server three times to turn it down but no luck. The drinks were fair, and took 15 minutes to get to the table. I can't imagine how long it would take if it were busy! The food was tasty, but the taco portion sizes were ridiculous for the money. Half the size of a normal taco and twice the cost. We had 2 small tacos, 1 order of sushi and 1 drink each, totaling $60!  Would not recommend and will not be back. Very surprised at the 4 star reviews. There are plenty of other trendy Scottsdale restaurants that surpass this place. Very very disappointing."}
{"text":"The service is the WORST I have ever experienced. I've been twice now and both times the service was horrendous. The waitresses are rude and lazy. The first time I want we were one of like five other tables in the place. We had to go get someone each time we needed someone! It seemed like it was almost a joke. The second time we went a waitress literally ignored us trying to talk to her as she walked by. She was actually whistling. If I were the manager, I would be so embarrassed that these girls do nothing and walk all over him/her. What a job! Sit and hang out with your friends at a side table folding napkins and getting paid for it. Lol! What a joke! Control your staff and teach them some manners and customer service. But we still go back cause the food is good. And unfortunately the service is so bad it causes me to give one star. But you won't get a tip from us ;)"}
{"text":"Looking for a great place to hang out listening to great music? This is the ultimate hangout spot. Spirits, great food and awesome party atmosphere. Highly suggest the tacos and wrapped dates. Don't forget to add a margarita."}
{"text":"The Mexican Asian fusion was at it's finest with the Mexican Pho - an amazing blend of flavors. The sushi was also very good. I sat at the bar and had friendly (but not fast) service. Margarita was above average.   Hip scene, somewhat loud. The place was decked out with Chinese paper balloons (not sure if this is permanent or just because of recent Chinese new year) that sort of clashed (and didn't 'fuse') with the Mexican style decor.  All in all, excellent meal, would return."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday at SumoMaya and loved each moment of it.  We were a large group who enjoyed the array of delicious dishes and the flow of unlimited mimosas.  Our server was on top of it.  Excellent pick for brunch I will go back soon.  They have best brunch deal in town."}
{"text":"Our experience was a bit of a mixed bag. We all went with the Restaurant Week menu, chicken and carne asada were very good but I'd recommend the chef back off the lime in the sauce with the beef though. My wife's salmon in a soyish broth disappointed however. She eats salmon everywhere all the time including my own on the grill so she knows her some fish. So, I'd say 3 out of 4 positives. The taco apps were tasty yet small. My wife's sushi roll lacked zing, I tried it, nothing special. Rice pudding, the only dessert available, I thought was great! Aside from the fare, this place, on a Friday night, was LOUD! First you crank crappy music up real loud so you can barely tell what song it is through the  distortion. Add a dense crowd of Scottsdale guys and gals, squawking at each other over the mush of the sound system and you have a less than ideal dining experience. Some reviews call this phenomenon, energy.  It's a place where the vapid can commingle with the self-absorbed while enjoying some pretty tasty fare. SumoMaya's fusion of Latin & Asian ingredients throughout the menu is mighty impressive and would be worth a return but the crowd and the sound system were much harder to stomach."}
{"text":"So I've been drinking margs for 40+ years and very few have impressed me very much until now. The premium marg here is like nothing I've ever had, even in Mexico. I've had both the sushi and Mexican food too and I've never been disappointed. Great crowd and wait staff as well, just be prepared for a wait if you don't have a reservation. Good job guys."}
{"text":"This place is great! We went during restaurant week in the fall 2014. ( this is very late) and we haven't stopped talking about it yet. The decor is perfection! I love it. The cocktails were very good. The food was well thought out and very tasty.We had the guac with dried fruit in it and I could eat it everyday. I wasn't a huge fan of the strawberry gazpacho. It was good,but gave me instant heartburn. Not their fault. I couldn't finish it and had to send it back, sadly. I told the waitress what happened and they happily took it back and brought us more guac instead ( insert happy dance) I had Al pastor pad Thai and that was fantastic. This place is all my fav cuisines in one restaurant. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Cool new vibe for Scottsdale....open, spacious but make a reservation for weekend."}
{"text":"My party of 17 had a blast at this restaurant for my sisters bachelorette party. At first i was skeptical of Asian and Mexican cuisines combined and if it would taste good. Boy, was I wrong. Every bite was more and more delicious. We had an incredible customized menu because the guest of honor is gluten free. I wish i lived in Arizona because i would definitely go again. Wait staff was awesome as well."}
{"text":"we had friends came over to visit out of state , we went to sumomaya , we had really fun , its was good food , good music , good service , all food came at time , really recommended ."}
{"text":"Fantastically hip spot.  Fusion between Mexican and Japanese food was awesome.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or dinner with friends.  This is my 6 or 7th time coming here and  they had better sauces/condements before.  Their mango sauce is great but you have to ask for it.  The drinks are fabulous.  The food is good but small portions and very expensive for the quantity/style of food.  I did love the sparkler birthday candle.  It makes a birthday lunch or dinner memorable.  The service wasn't the best and it took a long time get a drink or water refills.  Our waitresses over charged us for drinks.  They were top less but she charged for the refill as well after saying it was a different brand of liquor.  She could have carified it during ordering.  Maybe the happy hour is a way to go."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved the entire experience of this lovely place. We had a wonderful waiter who took so much time to explain this Asian/Mexican fusion  concept that was new to us. The decor is pretty and tasteful and the atmosphere had a cool vibe.  We loved the edamame and the eggplant.  I had the sangria which was yummy. This will be our new go to place. 100% recommend."}
{"text":"I love the concept behind this fusion restaurant. I found the interior to be stylish andcwell-appointed. The waittress was attentive, but I found her a little pushy and upselling (\"you absolutely have to get the guacamole...\") to be kind of annoying and intrusive. We found the prices expensive for small tapas dishes. Our party had mixed reviews on the food. The guacamole was unique and flavorful. Some of the tacos were just okay.   Something bizarre happened while the food was being delivered. A woman brought a bowl of miso soup and stumbled when putting it on the table. She spilled abiut 20% of the bowl's contents on the table and into the dish that the bowl sat on. She literally did not say a word about it - she just walked away. We thought she was going to get a towel, but nope. She never came back. We had to clean up the spill ourselves. We told the waittress about it and figured a manager might come by to apologize for this blunder, bit nope.  After the meal I asked my whole party to rate the whole experience fron 1 to 10. There were two 5s, a 7, and an 8. The 8 came from my seven-year old daughter.   I love the idea of the place but there were definite failures of execution."}
{"text":"Ok just happened to try this place on a whim and... Oh my god! The menu is well.. weird no better way to describe it. The mix of ingredients would not be one that I would ever think would work but it does, so well. Started with rib eye guacamole, amazing. Thai coconut soup was out of this world. Then came the kimchi fried rice delicious blend of flavors that had my tongue begging for more. And to top it off the tres leches cake was orgasmic. We'll be coming back!!"}
{"text":"The service was awful. The waiter Nick upsold us on all our meals, forced shots that we thought were free. Be careful going there and don't listen to Nick!"}
{"text":"Grat great food! I'm always looking for new flavors  new inventions Mexican Asian not bad at all,  food was delicious, service excellent  I'm definitely be back"}
{"text":"Food is crazy good. Recommend Dragon Roll, spicy Peach margarita, and crab noodles. Awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Amazing menu and overall solid execution. Substantial drink list which shows lots of thought was put into it. Not sure if there are any concepts like this that combine the Mexican and Asian cuisine so well.  Attention to detail is apparent. Some of the food may have taken too long to come out, so that might need some oversight. The tortillas for the guac were of inconsistent crunchiness. But that is easy too. The Korean beef tacos and the pork belly ramen were both easily 5 stars. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Phenomenal drinks, great people watching and very tasty food. Place is trendy.  A bit pricey? Sure - but as one of the top see and be seen spots of Scottsdale thats to be expected.  Been here close to a dozen times and service / food is consistent every time.  This place is not a 'culinary' masterpiece - but a great vibe and drinks more than make up for it all. Give it a try if you haven't already."}
{"text":"Update to my previous 2-star review:   Jason P from SumoMaya reached out after I posted my last review. He offered to have me and my date back for sort of a redeeming dinner, \"the real SumoMaya experience\" in Jason's words. I have always enjoyed this place, so I was happy to go back. As I said in my previous review, this place is cool and the food is good, I suppose I happened to be there at the wrong day and time.   The food was very enjoyable. This time we tried the Ecuadorian ceviche and the guacamole, both delicious by their own merits. The tostadas that came with the appetizers were extra thin and airy, not your typical tostadas but quite delicious nonetheless. I had the scallops, and my date had the Mexican Pad Thai, which I would imagine is what my grandmother from Sinaloa would have made had she been left alone in her kitchen with a combination of Asian noodles and Mexican ingredients. We closed the deal with a delicious dessert, which frankly was difficult to finish given the amount of delicious food we had consumed at that point. The drinks were great as well.   I appreciate that management reads these reviews and take proactive steps towards improving their customers' experience.   Thanks to Jason and the staff for a great evening!    ****  The first time was amazing. I had the Mexican Pho, the rollo chingon and many of the other specialty rolls; I remember being very pleased with the food, the service, and the ambiance. The second time I went for brunch, and though I was not particularly mind blown by the simplicity of the food and the lackluster service, the bottomless mimosas made up for it. The third time was not as good.   I had family visiting from San Diego, so I figured I would treat them to a different kind of brunch experience. Unfortunately, the hostesses had these weird condescending attitudes about them that just set the wrong tone from the get go. The three women behind the counter were as hospitable as the big tree in the middle of the restaurant, i.e. not hospitable at all. One of them told us that they were booked, but the high tables were available for walk-ins. She lazily pointed in the direction of said high tables, so off we went. We sat at one of the four open tables, waited for a good 5-10 minutes for someone to bring us menus, got too hangry for that kind of life, so we finally  walked out.   I wouldn't say I won't be coming back as  you can't truly judge a restaurant by the actions of a few employees (and I really liked that Mexican pho). The concept is interesting, the food is good, but the service seems to be deteriorating at a rapid pace. Management would benefit from ensuring their level of service is up to par with the food and location of this establishment."}
{"text":"When I give a restaurant a five star rating it means they made something that was the best that I ever had. SumoMaya has given me the best guac and chips experience thus far! I HIGHLY suggest getting their pomegranate guacamole. You won't regret it.  My bf and I shared a bunch of their dishes: apple salmon roll, al pastor pad thai, korean beef tacos, and tres leches cake. He drove so I also got the Golden Triangle drink. This was by far the most interesting drinks I have had during my trip to Arizona. It had a whole concoction of thing most notably sriracha and cracked pepper. It almost tasted like salted sweet plums that I used to have in Vietnam. My favorite entree was the apple salmon roll. The al pastor pad thai was good but I had to add sriracha to it. We did order mild but usually mild on a thai based dish is usually leaves a sting on your tongue. This did not. I wasn't the biggest fan of the korean beed tacos or the tres leches. I had high hopes for both but neither delivered a taste I'd care for again.   All in all, I liked all the different items in their menu. I'd highly recommend going here and just trying some of their drinks and their guac. If you have time for a whole meal, I don't think you can go wrong here."}
{"text":"We heard a lot of times from friends and family here. I really wasn't sure what should I expect to this restaurant. One day I was pretty curious about here for cocktails. We had 3 different margaritas and other cocktails and sushi rolls. Everything was a bit different style than what I usually get to other places but all of them was so great! This is good place to drink and chat."}
{"text":"As of the time of this review, SumoMaya is my favorite restaurant in the Greater Phoenix area. I have been here on multiple occasions, and love it every time. I celebrated my 30th birthday here, my aunt's 50th birthday here, and every time someone comes in from out of town, we take them here. I have probably tried at least half of the menu at this point, and absolutely everything has been delicious, and the presentation is on point. My husband is a chef, so he's really picky, and I don't think I've ever heard him make a negative comment about anything we've had here. The decor is awesome, so trendy, and I love the outdoor spaces. The only remotely critical thing I can say is that sometimes the food or drinks come out a little slow when they're busy, but since it's all served tapas-style, you're usually not hungry for long. Plus, the server usually will warn you when certain things (particularly sushi) get backed up. LOVE SumoMaya!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for Happy Hour. This restaurant is simply amazing. The center bar is the showcase which provides you a feeling of being both indoors and outdoors. The service staff at all levels were extremely attentive. We had an assortment of tacos. Great presentation and flavor. This is a cool place to go. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"fun place, good food and lots of people.. would recommend.. hard to park though, must valet."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Literally everything we ate I would order again.  We sampled the menu:  guacamole, sushi, tacos, sea bass and more.  It was delicious and so much more to try the next time we are in town.   Give it a try - you will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Asian Mexican whaaat! Yes as strange as it may sound it has been one of my best food experiences. It works very well and am wondering why it's not in my home town. The food was amazing, service superb. The waiter was absolutely, and wonderfully spot on with his suggestions. Pomegranate dried fruit Guacamole was very different and very good. DJ music while you eat was just right. Just a great overall experience."}
{"text":"Ordinarily I find \"fusion\" cuisine a little annoying. But SumoMayo exceeded expectations. We had delicious, funky sushi with jalape√±o, some fantastic rock shrimp, and spicy noodle dish. Been a couple of weeks, so don't remember the name of it. We shared those and a couple more things....great place for sharing! I had wonderful tequila cocktail that had a bit of cucumber and (I think) St. Germaine. Whatever it was, it was damned good! My wife abstained since it was her turn to drive (one of us is always the 100% alcohol-free driver). Next time we may have to take Lyft!"}
{"text":"I was here with 5 other women for happy hour.   First time for us, as we go to a different place each week.  The food was excellent.  No complaints there.  Loved the decor and atmosphere.  However, some of the worst service I have seen. 1. When I walked in as the first person,  I asked if the patio was also open for happy hour,  and I got a shrug from the waiter, saying I would have to ask the hostess.  He did not know.  I said never mind and put 2 pub tables together. 2. 3 of us ordered a sparkling wine, expecting it to be 2.00 off a glass. (About same price as most other wines.). Inexpensive.  When we inquired about the 2.00 not taken off, we were icily told that this was champagne, and not included.  In a way that implied that we probably didn't know the difference.  It was right there with the wines and the price was similar.  When I mentioned that perhaps when taking an order for happy hour it should be mentioned that it is not included, in a way that says \"is that ok?\"' She icily again said that is champagne!  The menu says wine! 3. We ordered the salmon roll and it did not come with the usual wasabi and ginger, so I asked if the chef recommends it without it, (seeing that it is fusion, maybe it has a different flavor), and the question was not answered.  She said most people like it that way.  She did bring me the wasabi. 4. We had to ask for plates for all of our appetizers. We are a very well dressed group of Scottsdale women, pleasant, not too demanding, and if we like the place, will come back with husbands for dinner.  Personally, my husband would not have had the patience for this.  Lots of very nice restaurants around."}
{"text":"Awesome fusion food! Our favorite is the sizzling chaufa rice! The sushi combinations were unique and delicious as well! This has become our go to brunch place for the weekends!"}
{"text":"I'm generally not a fusion fan - I find often they try to hard to be different and don't manage to make things that are really GOOD.  SumoMaya manages to do both, impressively, I might add.  Add to the mix that the ingredients that they use are obviously selected with care and are of excellent quality.  Presentation is really well done also.  We liked it so much we went 2 days in a row for lunch.  Both times service was good and food was exceptional.  We tried a bunch of different things - some specialty rolls, guacamole with pomegranate, Korean bbq tacos... everything was at least good and most were excellent.  The menu is fun and interesting.  I wanted to try it all.  It isn't cheap but it is well worth it.  I don't know that I would enjoy it for dinner because I can see it probably being crowded and loud.  I'm old :)   But for lunch it was excellent and will be my first choice any time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend.  It was ok; some dishes better than others.   Chicken mole - was ok; mole sauce was kind of bland Kimchee fried rice - was good, not too spicy Vietnamese Beef - was very good and tender bacon wrapped figs - these were the best of all the dishes we tried Sushi (can't remember which one but it had salmon and kiwi) - was ok, nothing special. Desert - salted caramel ice cream w/chocolate cake was very good! The wines are pricey - a small glass of red wine $18 .. yikes!  Setting and atmosphere are quite nice; loved the \"tree\" in the middle of the dining area and wait staff is attentive."}
{"text":"Such great atmosphere and fabulous food! We had such a food time. Drinks  too were so good! We were there for a birthday lunch and they made it so special."}
{"text":"I really didn't know what to expect but for once my husband and I both had a weekday off and the weather was beautiful and I wanted something new.  Let me say I am NOT an adventurous eater.  We sat \" outside\" and it was gorgeous.  The music was loud for us but hey, we're married.  We don't need to hear each other that well.  The prices are a little high for our budget but I was tired of the regular suspects.   I got the California roll (not adventurous, remember?)  And it was wonderful.  Not only was the sushi great and everything fresh, there was a generous amount of crab piled on top!  Bonus!Presentation was very nice but I'm about the food.  More than enough ginger and wasabi on the side.   My husband got the something pepitas sandwich.  The size of the serving of seasoned fries and sandwich were huge.  The roll looked chewy but was fluffy and awesome. The steak was to die for.  If you don't like rare, turn and run. If you're like me, sit and tuck in your napkin.  I'm not a $12 lunch girl UNLESS I get PLENTY and QUALITY.  It can't be just plenty. Would I prefer a half portion for half the price? Duh.  Is that going to happen in his land of too-much-plenty? Don't think so.   Will go again and split something.  Our server Danielle was wonderful. Another sucky 85' Feb day in yucky Scottsdale!  ( this is 2 hours later and I'm still stuffed.)"}
{"text":"I can only give this place 3 stars because of the staff.  They were all so super nice and very down to earth.  Sampled five drinks from friends being the DD and all,  didn't really like any of them except the frozen mojito and even that one was a little too sweet don't think I could drink a whole one.  They did say it was the most popular drink.  The peppers off the HH menu were surprisingly good.  Chx tacos way too small. I mean tiniest portions there all together.  The $18 tuna ceviche came out and there was hardly anything to it plus it wasn't good at all.  I did eat it though because I didn't want to waste $18 ceviche but really wish I would have sent it back.  Great presentation on it.  The guacamole was good but nothing special. They do only give u 5 chips to eat it and when u ask for more they charge u.   All in all. I've heard rave reviews about this place and all of us agreed it's not worth it to go back.  Sorry sumo! :("}
{"text":"The food is excellent. No complaints about the food. But the atmosphere is horrible. I've been here a couple of times and the music is always so loud you can't hear the person sitting next to you. I understand if this was only a bar, but this is a restaurant first, and it makes the dining experience unbearable."}
{"text":"Interesting dishes and decor. Better people watching. Like the people in Scottsdale, though, this place takes itself too seriously."}
{"text":"The Best Sushi in Scottsdale.  For all of you Sushi Brokers lovers, I had my doubts going in, but this place leaves no doubt of the best sushi in Scottsdale.  The Mexican/Asian Fusion approach really works with the different sweet fruit flavors, cilantro/sriracha and marinated meats (El Pastor) they blend together...  The service, atmosphere and drinks ($15 bottomless Mamosas/Bloodies) are top notch here.  Might be my favorite restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale now.  If you have a baby, be prepared to deal with no changing rooms in the bathrooms though.  Make sure to call in your reservation."}
{"text":"Returned here for dinner on New Year's Eve.  This time I had a great experience.  All of the food was great and the portions were large.  Maybe a little to big but I'm not sure if that's a thing.  They had a special menu that night that was five courses with plenty of different diverse choices for each.  I was able to have sushi and steak and potatoes.   The flan cheesecake was a great finish to the meal."}
{"text":"SumoMaya is a restaurant with great ambiance and a unique take on food with the Asian-Mexican fusion. Their sushi rolls are quite inventive and beautifully presented. I also enjoyed sharing their noodle dishes. Their tacos I think are a bit underwhelming if I'm being honest.   Service was always attentive and prompt. Especially as they bring out dishes as they are finished, it was a great way to share some food with friends.  Bottomline, great ambiance, good food and good service makes this a solid contender for anyone in the area even though Scottsdale is packed with great locations."}
{"text":"Food was good.  But happy hour prices will only be honored  for patrons sitting at the bar or hightop tables.  So if you want to go to happy with more than one person,  it can be a problem.  As there are only a few hightops.   They need to reduce the size of their plates so the table isn't so crowded.  Why use a dinner size plate for a few appetizers???"}
{"text":"Wow! I have not had this good of sushi and tacos ever.  What a brilliant and super tasty mash up of flavors.  The ambiance and service were exceptional as well!  This is a new go to for me!"}
{"text":"I met up here with two friends for dinner and the food was pretty delicious, and the service was great too. I loved the restaurant set up and would love to go back the next time I'm in town. I took one star away because we ordered the chocolate cake for dessert and I felt like it could have been a little bit sweeter. But overall great experience."}
{"text":"Tapas plates at entree prices. Way too expensive for just okay food and drinks. The environment was incredibly loud, more like an after hours place even though it was dinner hour. We had a hard time hearing each other talk over the music videos playing, even on the patio."}
{"text":"Tai reached out and invited me back. They gave me a wonderful experience. The food was very good full of flavor and the service was top notch."}
{"text":"Buyer Beware...tiny tiny portions. Tacos as big as my thumb. In addition a customer at the bar next to me ordered the Lobster and Crab Dynamite $24, it was the size of the iPhone6 plus including the lobster shell. Customer was. Price point to portions...$$$$ Beware!"}
{"text":"Edited to add: someone representing this restaurant sent me a message after my review was posted that was very passive aggressively \"apologizing\" for the other patrons in the restaurant. Did you think you were going to shame me into changing my review? None of that changes the fact that the food is mediocre at best, ridiculously overpriced, it's incredibly loud to the point that you can't carry on any conversation, and ultimately completely unimpressive. The people who frequent a restaurant can say a lot about it - given that those who choose to visit this one were overwhelmingly obnoxious, I think that says something about what this restaurant is all about. I've been to many classy establishments in Scottsdale, and this is just not one of them.   Came here for my two year anniversary at the suggestion of some of the doctor's I worked with. I figured if they, Scottsdale docs, liked it then it must be good. Everything about this place comes off as trying too hard. The other patrons were one step away from Ed Hardy t-shirts and rhinestone jeans, and a table of spoiled brat Scottsdale high schoolers being obnoxious and howling over stupid shit definitely put a damper on the mood. However, as the restaurant can't help who eats there, I didn't hold it against them. The music was deafeningly loud, and as it was our anniversary I would have liked to enjoy some conversations, but that was not happening. The food was sub-par, and considering that it was ridiculously expensive, it was not worth it at all. Very underwhelming all in all, next time I'll stick to one of the classics and not waste my money shooting for trendy and disappointing."}
{"text":"Design and atmosphere is great, service is good, food is good, but I wouldn't eat there everyday."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for the weekend all you can eat brunch.  It was so much fun, lots of energy and people having a good time.  Also sushi for brunch along with the amazing enchiladas... we were really impressed with the fun quality of the food they were serving up."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst place for customer service when things go wrong. It's not your typical attitude kind of place so it was refreshing to see that from the worker standpoint. It is like walking into a restaurant run by social political party and you have no idea who the manager is as it is run by everyone and the manager was nowhere to be found when we asked for one. Very interesting experience. Next time you go there ask for a manager to see if they exist."}
{"text":"***SERVED WATER INSTEAD OF SHOTS*** great at accommodating the size of the party, food/drink requests and the ambiance is always good.  Our server Jordan was amazing and helpful.  My only complaint is with the management; the worst I've ever experienced, manager Mike was not professional or helpful.  We ordered almost 30 shots and about 14 were water with salt on the rim.  The manager refused to take any responsibility and accused people at the table of pouring water in the shots. He was clearly being rude and unprofessional to our excellent server, and was condescending and rude when he finally agreed to comp the shots."}
{"text":"Overall rating is 3 because have very specific food and service complaints because I expect a 5 star rated restaurant to be solid on all fronts  Food - order the dorado tacos. delicious - do NOT order the Mexican Pho - greasy and oily - do NOT order anything with pastor - it was so disappointing and lacked flavor  Atmosphere & decor was great Service could have been better"}
{"text":"YUM! The food is wonderful. Tasty combination of Asian and Mexican. Decorations are fun, and environment is pleasant. Staff was friendly. Would absolutely visit here again on my next trip."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on my fianc√©es birthday. Food was good and the unlimited brunch specials were definitely diverse and were very tasty. I like the unlimited drink special that runs as an option for brunch, but the drinks were average. We weren't very pleased with where we were seated but that was only a minor setback for how busy it was at that time of the day. We are gonna give it another shot to re-evaluate our feelings on this place again soon to see how solid the 4 star review is."}
{"text":"To preface this, I went with three Asian people. I talked them into it. Because I had heard such great things. It was bottomless mimosas and drunk people all around. Nothing wrong with that. Everyone was very well dressed and looking spiffy. We got and shared several sushi dishes, street tacos and some appetizers. I was expecting upscale Cali style dining but nothing was good, really. The tacos were little soggy circles of blandness. The shishito peppers were okay. My Japanese friend states the sushi was not worthy of being served. This is not a picky person, mind you. The mimosas were fine, we also tried a Sonoran Sunrise which was all alcohol. Which I drank, of course. Really cool place with a huge tree in the middle. D√©cor very upscale, they just need to work on the food."}
{"text":"JENNIFER is the best!!!  The food is good too.  Sushi is delicious. Must try.  The guacamole is delicious as well."}
{"text":"I was expecting better and as such was disappointed.   The good news was our waiter was terrific; helpful, attentive and generally a warm fellow. The food ranged from good to poor. The items that were prepared at the sushi bar were all fresh, interesting and tasty. The items that were prepared in the \"kitchen\" were mediocre to bad.   There appears to be no attention to detail with the hot items from the kitchen. The chicken tacos of $15 were dry, bland and frankly an embarrassment. The Vietnamese beef dish was marginal at best. The vegetables were cooked fresh but the beef was dry and seemed like it was cooked well before the meal was assembled.   The place was VERY load and full of groups of women that spent all their time either taking pictures of each other or looking at their phones. I have never seen so many groups of women at a restaurant at one time; it was clearly a \"seen and be seen place\" where they are selling an atmosphere and food quality is second to providing a \"hip\" social environment.   In summary; the food is OK but very overpriced, the atmosphere is unique but very load and the attention to detail is poor. I doubt that I will go back."}
{"text":"Great happy hour menu. Speciality cocktails were good and the bacon wrapped dates were delish! The service was amazing! Chelsea our waitress was very attentive and friendly, she gave us a lot of really good recommendations. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Very good food.   Teriyaki Salmon was cooked perfectly , Carne Asada and the sauce that came with it was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The brunch is to die for! I absolutely loved the fried rice, fruit & yogurt platter, Mexican bread, the Pad Thai, everything! The only issue we had was when we were seated, we were never told that we couldn't order a la carte, unless we were seated at the bar. Our waitress was so nice though and talked to her manager so the people in my party who wanted a la carte could have it. For the brunch it was endless sides/starters, and they were amazing. Unfortunately though we didn't receive all of them. When we told our waitress this, she claimed she brought them to us, when really, we never received them. She then fixed it and brought the food we didn't get. It's ok though, the food is amazing and I will definitely return for dinner. The atmosphere is gorgeous too! :)"}
{"text":"Who would have thought Asian-Latin fusion would work so great? Tamarind in pad thai? This place was great! I was so interested in the menu that I wanted to try everything! The hostess' were a little subpar, hence the 4 stars and told us an hour wait when tables opened up 10 minutes after we sat at the bar, but the wait staff was awesome. If it's your first time here, just ask and they'll have excellent recommendations. For drinks, try the Kumquat! A fresh drink after a hectic day for sure. I would highly recommend the Pork \"Al Pastor\" Pad Thai! It was absolutely delicious and plenty, even enough for two if your so inclined! It was a wonderful fusion between the Asian/Latin menu this place offers!"}
{"text":"SumoMaya has a fun menu. We ordered several things from the happy hour menu. I loved the unique flavors and combinations. They also have an amazing mango habanero sauce that you can use on any food item you choose. The salsa platter wasn't that interesting but the guacamole with crab meat was awesome. I would recommend coming and sampling off of the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"I have to start this in saying I generally am rather picky.  It's not that I don't like new things, but I generally gravitate in a specific comfort zone and go from there.  My mother and sister had been here once before, and felt it was a place I would love.  So, for a birthday celebration I found myself there.  Let me tell you a little bit about my experience and the case of the vanishing dishes.  Immediately, I blown away by the decor.  The place is clearly modeled in a modern fashion and is very eye catching.  Easy to navigate, and with a great view of both the sushi station and the kitchen itself, you can literally see everything going on.  When we first sat down, we were pleasantly greeted, and were explained in great detail the cocktail menu and the tastes as well.  From there, we the took a gander at the menu and this is where the real excitement began.  While I have had Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese before I have never quite had anything like what SumoMaya offers.   We immediately started off with sushi.  Being that I have had sushi before and watched \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\" I considered myself to be an expert on the raw fishy product.  Ok, I'm not, but I didn't need to be to say that the Spicy Crab we had was absolutely delightful.  A great splash of spice with a hint of lemon to help balance, myself and my family immediately devoured it.  From there, we then ordered the Tempura Cod and Korean tacos.  Those found themselves immediately devoured as well, and in this case even quicker than we could truly appreciate the fantastic presentation.  So far, SumoMaya had been blowing us away in food and after sipping on the four different cocktails we had ordered based upon the waitress's suggestion we were certainly on cloud nine.  Then, came Mexican Pho.  I must confess that my first trying of Pho came from an ex, and I was an addict after my first try.  So, after seeing this I just had to get it.  The waitress was polite to let us know that it was far from a normal Pho, and she certainly was right.  However, right in the best possible way.  This was like a chili meets a splash of Pho.  We immediately devoured it as the Pad Thai came out, only for that to mysterious vanish immediately.  Food seems to not stick around for long when it comes to SumoMaya.  Fusion cuisine can be a bit of a skeptical situation, and I've seen recent reviews not care for this place but to be honest I can't see why.  We had a variety of food covering several aspects of the menu, including dessert, and found that the consistency was spot on for every dish.  The cocktails were unique and creative, the menu was diverse and each dish was incredibly well prepared and enjoyed by the entire family.  Further, the pricing was more than fair for the quality.   The only real complain I could offer is that the service was a bit slow, but for them wishing me Happy Birthday after my sister informed them and doing so not with a song, not with a giant commotion, but very polite manners and a simple candle left me thinking, \"A bit of a longer wait is alright by me\".  I think I'll find myself driving up from Tucson just to go here every now and again."}
{"text":"Initially, I gave this place a one star review. I drove to Phoenix from Tucson to take my sister here for a birthday brunch and had a terrible experience. Since then, this restaurant reached out to my sister and I to see if the experience could be improved. I didn't drive down again but my sister went with her boyfriend and said the service and food was fantastic. She was very full and said they wished her a happy belated birthday. As long as she's happy, I'm happy. Thank you for taking care of my sister."}
{"text":"Tried the pork belly ramen and the rock shrimp tempura. The pork belly itself was good, the ramen was decent. The rock shrimp tempura was a different twist, also decent. Might come back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a group of ladies. Loved the ambience and vibe of the restaurant. The menu had a variety of choices and some interesting combinations of food. Our server did a good job considering we were a large group of 14...even separating the bills without asking. I enjoyed my lunch of 3 tacos - mahi, carnitas and Korean beef and added the edamame side. The tacos are street size (small) but I didn't leave hungry. They were very flavorful and had some kick. Korean beef was my favorite. Other ladies ordered shrimp avocado salad that looked amazing. Someone got a noodle dish that I tasted and it was delicious! The only negative was 1 person in our group got served her basic salad nearly when everyone else was finished. Not sure what happened but manager came over to apologize to her.    Overall the cost was little higher than I would normally spend for a lunch but I enjoyed the food, ambience and service and would return."}
{"text":"I have only been to this establishment once and it was a very decorative environment to be in. Everyone is dressed to impress. The food was a bit small in proportion and a bit over priced but it's a good destination to bring a small party of friends or family. The food was a mixture between Asian and Mexican which I have never seen nor tasted. Fresh ingredients and a great staff has really made this restaurant pop! I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is one of the best meals I've had in Phoenix. A group of 6 of us dined here last night. We all got something different and we all shared. Everything we had was amazing! I got the lobster ceviche and the sea bass. The pomegranate guac was also amazing. The sushi rolls were good, but I appreciated the appetizers abs sea bass more. For dessert we got the tres leches, which was also good. But man, that sea bass really was one of the best I've ever had! Hands down we will be going back here again soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, upbeat, loud music, great for groups. Order food conservatively as many dishes are very big and designed to share. We came with a group of 12 and our server was great and got everything right. All staff payed close attention to guest needs. Food was insanely good!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe of the restaurant. Came in with my mother, father, and baby sister. They were able to tweak a dish for the baby to make sure she could eat with the rest of us. I had the rock shrimp(must have) and the tuna tacos. All the portions are small but delicious. If you are looking to fill up without spending very much this is not the place for you. I enjoyed the food as did the rest of the family. The downfall is the server was barely there. I don't like my meals rushed but it was to the point I didn't get to order a drink until 20 minutes in. Despite that I will definitely be back. Probably without the baby this time! Overall good time."}
{"text":"Would comment on the food but couldn't even get to a table. One word: RUDE.   The host was the rudest I have ever encountered in my life. We had made a reservation via the hotel concierge, and were so excited to eat there as the menu looked unique.   We were told they could only seat us outside, it is still over 42 degrees at this hour, and that if we wanted a table inside we would have to wait over 45 minutes. When we explained that we are tourists and this is our last night of vacation and we are hardly accustomed to sitting outdoors here, he had nothing to offer other than rude remarks.    Not impressed with the lack of hospitality- especially in a town like Scottsdale where every other encounter has been pleasant and polite."}
{"text":"Quick stop at Sumo Maya in Scottsdale tonight. Those guys are perfectionists! Not one dish leaves the kitchen without 1-2 guys checking it. The presentation is amazing - every dish looks like art! We had the ginger fried rice, the Suzuki Roll, and the apple Apple - Salmon Roll. Really good. Oh, and just from watching that one perfectionist plating the food, the carne asada guacamole looks amazing!"}
{"text":"Most of the brunch we had was excellent. The guac starter was just OK. And the eggs were a bit under done and had to be sent back. Overall, it was definitely good quality food and nice atmosphere. Will go back to try a dinner soon!"}
{"text":"The chips they give with the guacamole and ceviche were amazing.  Chaufa Rice and Korean Tacos were very good as well.  The spicy tuna sushi and Rainbow Ceviche were okay."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! We went for \"all you can eat\" Sunday brunch. Even though it was all you can eat, the quality was still there. You get to choose anything on the starters menu, however they will only bring you two at a time. We had sushi, oatmeal, the sweet breads, and my favorite the black bean hummus. (There was more to choose from, we just had to stop so we could continue on the menu!) next, you choose one item from the main dish, and then you may choose all side dishes (they have 4). I got the Cuban breakfast sandwich, which was delicious! My husband chose a brisket meal, which he enjoyed. We ordered a Chinese sausage fried rice and chorizo potatoes, which were ok. Now, you think you've eaten enough, and can't fit anymore down, but you still have dessert coming! You can't skip dessert when it's included in your meal price! I chose what was basically a deconstructed cheese cake, and it was to die for good! My husband chose the cinnamon chips, which were also great (but not as good as the cheesecake). In addition to the bottomless brunch, for $10 more you can have bottomless bloody Mary's or margaritas, which my husband added to his meal (I stick with iced tea). It was a great experience and you should definitely treat yourself sometime to it!"}
{"text":"Great food! The arroz con pato was amazing! And the drinks were awesome! First time ever trying bacon concerned dates and I was impressed. The decor is gorgeous and staff is nice. Great place to go with friends on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Hands down best meal I have ever had! My girlfriend and I got a bottle of wine to share bacon quac with there homemade chips 2 different roles  and there garlic crab stir fry  and it was hands down the best!"}
{"text":"Came to Scottsdale from out of town and found this place that looked nice from the street.  My wife had Tacos and I had Sushi.  All food was good.  The steak in the tacos were rare to medium rare which made my wife pass on them, but the others we were with liked them. I had the sushi which was great.  Kinda weird to go to a Mexican Fusion place and get sushi, but it was good!  I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This place has been a long time coming, and I'm glad to see it's finally open.  We had a quick dinner at the bar last night, and the food is so good that I want to write a quick review.    It's a cool restaurant physically, although the high ceilings kill a bit of the intimacy, and probably costs them a fortune in air conditioning.  We sat at the bar, which is large and comfortable, and ordered our dinner there.    There were a LOT of people working behind the bar.  I didn't count, but it looked like they were tripping over one another.  Our bartender was very nice, even replacing a drink I didn't like that I ordered from the cocktail menu.  But the service isn't completely dialed in at Sumo yet.  For instance, I ordered the FABULOUS mushroom tacos, but a server brought over chicken tacos.  I told him it was wrong, and instead of taking them back to the kitchen, he got in a bit of an argument with our bartender, and our bartender showed him our ticket twice because he seemed to want someone to blame.  It was an unnecessary conversation in front of a guest, and he should've simply apologized and brought the right dish.  This was all on the server, not our bartender.    Every food item we ordered was splendid.  I had the tacos, my wife ordered the Kimchi fried rice, and we had the traditional guac.  We ordered some garbanzo beans, too, but somehow they didn't get into the computer, but we didn't finish the guac, so it was no huge loss.  We are vegetarians, and we were very happy with the wide variety offered to veggie customers.  My only complaint is that you get a ton of guac and too little of the bread for dipping, which is another $1.  I can afford another dollar, but it seems cheap on the restaurant's part, but that's a small complaint for what was a great meal.  For drinks I ordered the top two items on the cocktail menu: a five spice rum drink and a coconut drink.  I didn't find either remarkable, but I'm willing to keep going down the menu on future visits.   The crowd is pretty typical Scottsdale, which is generally a turnoff for me and I tend to stay on my home turf in central Phoenix, but I'll venture down Lincoln Rd and sneak in again soon."}
{"text":"I am going to start with a WOW!!! I was completely blown away with this Restaurant. I am not easy to please. That being said, let's get to the food. My family tried several dishes; the Shishito Peppers, Chile Crab Garlic Noodles, Crispy Calamari, Shishito Roll, Maya Roll, and the Chilean Sea Bass.  Everything was prepared and/or cooked perfectly. The two things that stood out was the Calamari and the Sea Bass. The game changer for the Calamari was the sauce and the salad it sat on top of. I could have that everyday. The Sea Bass was cooked to perfection. I've eaten fish at a lot of Restaurants and this is the best I have ever tasted. My only complaint is that I wish there was more of it. There was only two small skewers with two cubes of fish on each. They also use REAL crab in all their dishes, even the sushi rolls. Besides the food, the decor itself is very fun and bright and suites its theme. My family was there with my 4 month old around 5:30pm on a Saturday. Already at that time the places was hoppin'. I recommend making reservations.  The wait staff was very accommodating and super friendly. We and sat on the patio and we were glad because the inside was very loud and a little cramp. The patio is very nice and misters are very good. If you do bring a baby, they do have highchairs, but no place to change a diaper in the restroom.Other then that minuscule detail, I can't wait to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"First time at SumoMaya & it was a great experience!! We started with the lump crab guacamoles. It was the best guacamole I have ever had, I can't wait to try the other flavors. Then I had the sesame ginger chicken tacos, and they were amazing!! Our server was great, very attentive and was on top of our water refills. We tried two different desserts, the key lime pie and a peanut butter mousse cake. Both desserts were delicious. We sat at the bar and the chef stopped over to say hello to us and ask how everything was. A manager also stopped by and checked on us. Overall it was a perfect dinner outing! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The creative cocktails alone is enough reason to check this place out. The food was all very tasty. Relatively young crowd and could be a great date spot."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite spots.  I've gone in the day and I absolutely love it.   That being said, the douche factor is SUPER high in the evening. Once it hits dark, holy crap the douches and cougars come rolling out.  However, for a lunch spot or happy hour location, I'm a fan.  The food is fresh , unqiue, and very reasonably priced.   It's a bit confusing because it is an Asian/mesican fusion. So you can order sushi and a taco.  A bit odd at first, but just go with it.  It works somehow.    The sushi is fresh and the Mexican Pho is my go to.  The pho portion size is enormous and is more than enough for a lunch/dinner. Be sure to order the Mexican Street Corn as it is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"This place has fantastic service and tasty unique food. We had a pork belly inspired dinner including guacamole, sushi, and ramen; all with pork belly.  It was all delicious. My only complaint about the food was the egg in the ramen was less cooked than I prefer, with quite a bit of the white uncooked, but still edible. I am visiting Phoenix for the second time and Josh, who was our waiter was hands down the best server I have had in this town. I was however a bit disappointed in the atmosphere.  It felt more like a loud club than a restaurant. If you want to chat with someone across the table, or your server for that matter, get ready to yell because this place is loud (all of the servers were squatting at tables taking orders and such).  They did slightly turned down the volume after asking twice, but it would slowly move back up. Our server politely explained that the restaurant management makes a conscious decision to feel more club like and he was sorry if we weren't happy with the volume, he would pass our complaints on.  I was not surprised that our request to lower the volume did little to change the volume because there was a DJ at the hostess desk. I would eat here for lunch because the food and service were great, but will avoid dinner hours in the future (our reservation was 6:30 PM on a Saturday)."}
{"text":"Very unique and intriguing!  Definitely try if you are a foodie!  Loved the dishes and would return but a little too noisy for my taste as a favorite restaurant.  Favorite dish was the season mushrooms -- must try :)  We also got: Chicken tacos -- very small, but fresh and delicious!!  Pork belly roll -- crispy and interesting! A little too intense for my taste.  Strawberry gazpacho -- delicious!!!  Ps happy hour only works at the bar."}
{"text":"It scares me that the guy behind the sushi bar has a foot long beard. There are probably little hairs falling in food.. Disgusting. The owner should have a policy requiring that people (anyone handling food with hearty facial hair) wear a cover / hair net contraption as protection. I love this place but Jesus Christ cover that thing."}
{"text":"Very very bad service. They told us to wait for 45 mins & then told us it is pass Happy Hour time. Do not come here because the food is very BAD. The services are really POOL. The front desk girls are Stupid. They brought their friends in even their friend came in after."}
{"text":"Came here with a bachelorette party of 7 girls and we had the best experience! The music was amazing, the restaurant is beautiful, and the service was fantastic! There were four or five other bachelor/bachelorette parties there that night as well and it just made for a fun vibe. We ordered some sushi to share and it was plenty of food with drinks. I would definitely recommend this place for larger groups and if you're looking for a fun dinner spot!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! First of all we had great service, the food was on point and came out so quickly!  It was hot, fresh, and delicious!  There was a group of 5 of us and we were borderline hangry when we showed up for our reservation. Emma was our server and she made great food and drink recommendations. The food started coming out so quickly and we loved everything we got!  Very fun, lively atmosphere with great service and delicious food. The price point is appropriate for the food quality and service we definitely recommend it!  Make sure to get the sea bass, scallops, some sushi rolls, the rock shrimp and the calamari!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was really nice. 5 stars for that. Very hip and modern and open-air. I ordered the pad thai, and the portion was disappointingly small. It was pretty good (I'd say average among the dozens of pad thai dishes I've tried) but for the price it wasn't worth it. My dad ordered the pork belly ramen and we were both sorely disappointed. The noodles were good, but the broth wasn't nearly as rich as a real Japanese tonkotsu broth should be, and the pork belly was overlooked. I left with the impression that I was more paying for the atmosphere than the food."}
{"text":"SumoMaya's happy hour is a great way to sample some of their dishes and flavors. They have $3, $5 and $7 dollar food choices, including the tacos. Beer, wine and specialty cocktails are all discounted. And I love the fact that they have their happy hour on the weekends too!  It's a really fun space, we sat at the bar, but would like to go back and sit on the patio when it isn't 115 degrees out. The staff were friendly and efficient.   We had the: - togarashi spiced popcorn, so good! slightly citrusy and also buttery, I could have eaten a giant bowl of it. - salmon avocado roll, good, very nicely presented. A basic sushi roll, the salmon was good quality. - crispy calamari, really good! tender squid, not greasy. Tossed in a sweet chili garlic sauce with sesame seeds. The also threw some cherry tomato halves and peas into the mix.  - tacos - we tried 3, the sesame ginger chicken, Korean beef and pork al pastor. The pork was definitely the best, the fresh pineapple really went nicely with the pork. The chicken was our next favorite, but you could mainly taste the ginger slaw. The Korean beef was disappointing, we thought it would have the most flavor, but it had the least, very boring.  The Jalapeno Monk margarita was great, spicy and sweet, it also had cucumber, which was refreshing.  Overall we would definitely go back, especially for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience all the way around... The service was on point both times I went and the food as well as plate presentation were outstanding. Myself and some friends order small plates to share and we started with the potbelly roll which was out of this world. We then ordered a series of tacos with the highlight being the pastor. This is a must go and would highly recommend them especially in the evening when they have the dance music and high energy atmosphere"}
{"text":"The bottomless brunch is amazing! You can order unlimited appetizers, one entry, sides and dessert! Plus you get to have bottomless drinks. Get there early tho it gets packed quick!"}
{"text":"I heard that their all you can eat sushi buffet was good. This was standard sushi. I wouldn't say that it was great or exotic but it wasn't bad. The sushi chiefs weren't very talkative or attentive for that matter but that was ok. I would say this place is just that, OK"}
{"text":"The food was FANTASTIC...the manager(Brandon)was very welcoming and and I have never seen a manager more attentive and on top of EVERYTHING going on in the restaurant. Our server(Kayla) was darling...and she had wonderful suggestions on what to eat(like the pomegranate guacamole...omg it's to die for)  Food=10, Service=10, Decor=10...it doesn't get any better than this!!!  We can't wait to go back again!!"}
{"text":"A fusion of my two faves - Mexican & Asian. My husband took me here for our date night last night. I walked in and was in love! The vibe is hip, but romantic. Through reading the reviews, we expected the restaurant to be really loud; it was not at all. Yes, the music was at a higher volume than most restaurants, but it honestly helped to create the vibe of the place! We started with the guacamole, continued with the chicken tinga tacos, and ended the night with 2 sushi rolls (the salmon avocado and the Suzuki roll). Both full of flavors of Asian and Mexican cuisine. If you're looking for a fun place (reasonably priced) and a great place to people watch, go to Sumo Maya!! We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Full flavor and Kambucha Ginger beer.  Son had the Garlic Crab Noodles and I had the Chicken Mole...flavor explosion.  Started with the Dried Fruit Guacamole...so good."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I like the decor and I like the funky Asian/Mexican infusion food that they have. Their brunch is really good too - just a bit loud with the DJ to talk to your friends. Being able to get some good pad thai and good sushi is awesome. Their staff is always really nice and friendly. The last visit we sat at the bar and the bartender was super helpful with picking some Sake and we met the bar manager I believe too, and he was great as well. Definitely a spot to regularly go to."}
{"text":"If there was 4.5 stars, I'd give this place that since I wasn't a fan of the Skinny Margarita. But the food was AMAZING so that made up for it. We had the Chinese-Style Chile-Crab Garlic Noodles, which were great and reminded my boyfriend of the food he used to have growing up. We also had the Korean tacos which were great, as were the mussels--I'm a huge mussels fan. The ambience was great (LOVED the decor) except the fact that we were seated outside in the summer in Phoenix and it wasn't quite cool enough on the patio for that...but we got over it."}
{"text":"Very fun, and great food. The environment is exciting and busy, it gives me a club feeling, it is loud so take that into account if you are going on a first date. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in AZ, a little pricey but well worth it, if I cant cook it I will pay for it and this is as unique as it comes.  If you are not wanting to spend alot, join them for Happy Hour, great prices on amazing food.  I really enjoy the atmosphere and the food has never let us down, anytime we have friends in town, we always like to give them the Sumo Experience!"}
{"text":"Omg this place is amazing. We came here for brunch and did their all you can eat menu which entails endless appetizers and sides and desserts plus 1 entree. I had the wagyu and eggs for my main and it was perfect and I inhaled it all. We pretty much tried all the appetizers and out favorites were the black bean hummus, pomegranate guacamole, and 3 leches oatmeal. I hate black beans but this hummus was out of the world- very garlicky. My husband had the salmon omelette which he cleaned plate on as well. Both dessert options were fantastic. The service was great, the places was very clean, and the decor so awesome."}
{"text":"So my wife and I have been here 4 times.  We originally had brunch here on a visit prior to moving.  I love sushi and my wife likes tacos so it works out for us.  The sushi is great and the guacamole is killer, we have had the traditional, bacon and lump crab guac.  The staff is very friendly and attentive and were okay with us slowing down service to enjoy ourselves.  The ambiance is very relaxing."}
{"text":"Our server was extremely polite and very efficient. Tableware was clean, organized, and well placed. Atmosphere was the best! Love the interior design so posh !"}
{"text":"Just went here last night for the first time and I'm already dying to go back! It is probably one of the best places I have ever eaten. It was reverse happy hour so everything was really cheap! Every single thing we got was super delicious!! We got chicken tacos, beef tacos, pork tacos, bacon wrapped dates, calamari and a tuna hand roll for under $30 and I was in love with all of it!! I didn't take the time to take pictures of the food because I was so excited to eat it but I will try next time. I regret not trying the coconut cocktail cause it sounded amazing so I will have to try that when we go back.   Their service was also great as well!! I drink my water very quickly and they were on top of my refills the whole time. I was never without my drink. The food comes out super fast as well! Austin was our server and he was so super nice and attentive and so were the other servers walking around checking on us as well!   1000 out of 10! A perfect experience!"}
{"text":"I was there last week for dinner me my wife and my kids they werent too busy and we waited long time for our server to take the order when the food was ready was iced cold they said would remake the food but we left we didnt want to wait 1 more our for our food i paid before i left but i wasnt not very happy with the service and the food worst restaurant ever"}
{"text":"First time there and loved it.  First I need to say that I am all about ambiance and vibe when it comes to liking a restaurant.  I like action, openness, colors, TVs, class and service.  This place had all of the above.  I only tried a limited selection of food but I hope to go back and try a lot more.  The guacamole and shishinto peppers were good but the Bacon Wrapped Dates were excellent.  What I liked most is the Atmosphere.  This place was well put together.  It was trendy but not smug. The service was excellent.  Having spent some time in the \"Industry\" myself, it was a joy to watch management helping out the servers running cocktails and taking drink orders if needed.  Well done guys. I will be back and hope to have a similar experience."}
{"text":"Came here for my wifey's bday dinner as i wanted to take her to some off beat fusion-y kinda place and sumo maya din't disappointed a bit. Five stars for the ambience, food and service. A bit pricey, but it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this restaurant and when restaurant week begin, I told myself, PERFECT.... I am going to go sample this robust flavor of Mexican Fusion. What a disappointment!  First and foremost, the decor/ambiance and food presentation was beautiful, thus why I gave it a 2 stars. The service was slow and the food was terrible!  My friend order the Maya Roll and the Jalapeno Monk. I opted for the prix-fixe menu selection with a Sake Sangria.  Drinks were delivered late to the table. The sushi is bland.  The Ceviche Del Dia had nice flavor yet let's take out the edible flower. Unless I'm camping and the bear stole my food, I don't need edible floras in my dish.  The sauce in the Salmon entree was overly seasoned.  Overly Salty to state bluntly. The dish was coupled with welted asparagus and greasy fried rice.  Now if you call yourself Asian/Mexican fusion, get it right. How the heck to do you mess up fried rice?  Isn't that a staple dish for the two cultures?  The chocolate peanut butter desert was descent, a tad rich for my liking yet edible.  Overall, this is of one of the many new modern dining experience that spent tons of money on decor, located in an expensive neighborhood yet failed to deliver the essence of quality food and impeccable service."}
{"text":"Always happy with whatever I get to eat from here! The only negative is the loud party atmosphere, but that's why I like getting take-out instead from here. You can tell a lot of thought went into the menu, and you won't be disappointed in anything from start to finish. Don't make the mistake of being too full for dessert! The sticky chocolate cake is a favorite. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest places I've been to! The vibe is hip and trendy and the food is amazing! The thought of an Asian/ Latin fusion seemed like a bazaar concept at first but they really nail it. Definitely a great place to take at date but I recommend making reservations at least 5 days in advanced for the weekend's."}
{"text":"Delicious food and terrible coffee.:) nice environment and good service. Maybe prices are not that friendly"}
{"text":"What a great experience!! The food here is so different then anything I have experienced before. It's Asian fusion to be exact. The kimchi rice is amazing and the miso sea bass melts in your mouth! The drinks were so good. The one with coconut rum was delish, I had three. Another wonderful night and another great spot in Arizona! I will deff come back next time I'm  in town."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. The food was outstanding, everything was extremely well seasoned and absolutely delicious.   We got the shisito peppers, charred edamame, spicy yellowtail roll & the mushroom taco and fish taco. The shisito peppers were the best I've ever had and the edamame with the miso butter were unbelievable. Great happy hour specials and they have Saturday happy hour!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  All four of my party ordered something different.  We shared and everything was good.  Great atmosphere too"}
{"text":"We ate so much while here. The rock shrimp sushi roll than the beef tacos. The entrees were the pork belly ramen noodles and the Chinese crab garlic noodles. Everything was delicious. I loved the atmosphere. There is a large tree in the middle of the restaurant that you almost don't even notice because there is so much going on. All the food was beautifully displayed on the plate. Definitely culinary artists"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were excellent. You really feel the whole fusion of Mexican-Asian unlike other restaurants. This place is also perfect for drinks and music.  My fianc√© and I were dancing in our seats the whole time.  Food wise you must try: -Mexican street corn  -kimchi fried rice  Those two orders were just explosions of flavors in your mouth you don't want to skip out on."}
{"text":"OMG!   Love the design.  The staff was fantastic...very helpful and attentive.  The food was a 10!  And they kept walking by with things we hadn't ordered and we would say... \"WHAT is THAT!   Yummmm.\"   Too many choices.  We had the apple salmon sushi roll...unbelievably good!  And the guac which was superb."}
{"text":"Been here about 3 times for dinner. Great food every single time. No complaints what so ever. The wings are delicious; so are the fish tacos, guacamole, sushi. We have tried many things and they're all amazing. Every time I go back I get the wings because I loved them so much. Lol music can be a little loud but not too bad. The drinks are ehh for me. I don't like all the twists they have to them. Mangorita was good!! I wonder if you can order a regular Moscow mule or mojito instead of what they have ? I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Last night we went for dinner. Few things that I was not impressed with. Found a Cricket literally hopping around on our table. When we addressed it the waitress killed the Cricket and didn't even say anything. No apology, no \"let me talk to the manager and let him know what happened\" it was like it happens all the time. Thought that was kinda strange. Atmosphere is great but the food is super expensive and you get very little... can't say it was as great as I remember it. If it wasn't for the bug and servers reaction I would prob give it a 3-4 star."}
{"text":"I had been waiting for this restaurant to open because I believe that Asian and Latin food fusion makes a great combination.  We went there first for happy hour; since I couldn't stay long, I ordered the mushroom tacos.  The mushrooms were delicious but nothing on the menu said it would be spicy - but it was VERY spicy.  Finally figured out that the onions are pickled with serrano chilis and that's probably what I bit into that made the taco so SPICY. Next time, I asked that they \"hold\" anything spicy but the kitchen can't seem to know what is spicy and and what is not.  According the bartender: \"Well, what's spicy to you, may not be spicy to them\" and that's when I decided that as good as a couple of the dishes I've had, it wasn't going to be the next great find in my list. The kitchen can manage to make the Pad Thai al Pastor mild enough for me to enjoy and in another visit I also enjoyed the Chicharron de Pollo that I ordered and shared with my friend.  She ordered the Bacon Wrapped Medjool Dates.  The Guacamoles were not dissappointing but again, very spicy.  We tried the Lump Crab and Bacon. There was one dish (I believe it was the meatballs with soup) that apparently taken out of the menu because in the 5 times I went there, they were never serving it. I will likely go again as it seems to be popular with my friends but unfortunately, not the place I expected."}
{"text":"Our first time at SumoMaya.  We had heard good things and visiting Scottsdale from the Pacific Northwest, we thought we'd check it out.  This is a MUST TRY Experience!!!   From the minute we walked in, we loved the ambiance, the music, the tree, the chairs.....and then we tried the happy hour tacos and couldn't even talk, they were so good!   The fusion all night of Mexican food with Asian influence and vice versa had us flipping the menu back and forth trying to decide what was next!   The signature drinks were so good, we ended up trying a half dozen different drinks...all original and amazing!  But the best part of the night was our server Brittany Sines!   We ended up being there almost 5 hrs and she was just the right amount of attentive, made great recommendations and the highlight of the night was when she helped create a new after dinner drink!   We've been here dining out all week and tonight this restaurant and Brittany have been the absolute highlight!!!  Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a date or a group of friends. I love the small plates and everything is delicious. Great atmosphere and wait staff. This is now on my top favorite restaurants in old town Scottsdale !"}
{"text":"Asian+mexican! Muy rico. We pretty much tried half the menu lol. Portions are small so ordered a few things. My fave was the passionfruit sangria and the chingon roll. The pad thai was good but I think I like the traditional version best. Also really love the tree :)"}
{"text":"I have to say it stands to question an Asian/Mexican cuisine but it is a pleasant surprise! The salsa assortment was delicious and it is worth getting the tostada for chips as they do not come with the sampling. This is a tapas place, come to share and come to eat! Tried everything from the sushi to the Korean tacos to the bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates and all was wonderful. The only item that fell flat was the tacos el pastor, those get a solid 'meh'."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect...Asian-Mexican Fusion. What a pleasant surprise! I had the Crispy Chicken Mole (with plantains).  The mole was pretty close to my Grandma's and the sweetness of the plantains, drenched in mole sauce...Wow!   I also ordered the Hamachi Jalape√±o roll and Chamoy-Mango Rita...perfect balance of Sweet & Spicy. Service was fast but the DJ had the volume on 100, making it very difficult for our waitress to hear our order. We were there on a Friday night and next visit, I will definitely return.   If you're in the Scottsdale area, Sumomaya is a must. If you don't want to shout your order, try mid-week or midday."}
{"text":"Wow, great, fresh food and excellent service! The rainbow ceviche was absolutely the best thing ever. Very fresh salmon, hamachi and ahi. The specialty guacamole's were innovative and the tostada/homemade chips were great with everything. The verde arroz was a fantastic vegetarian dish with great flavor and super fresh mushrooms and roasted peppers and crunchy rice for amazing texture."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to Sumomaya and it was great! We were sat in the hot-ish part of the restaurant near the patio and it's 100 degrees out but it wasn't horrible. The decor was really cute and modern/contemporary with a fun vibe; I definitely want to check it out on the weekends. I ordered a green tea to drink along with the Al Pastor tacos and a side of white rice and black beans. Oh yeah the guac. We definitely ordered the guac(the \"plain\" one), definitely was far from plain and I'm saying that in the absolute best way possible. This was the best guac ever. Next time I think I'm going to order the guac and a drink and be a happy camper. The food was good but the guac was phenomenal and it was served with some crispy corn tortilla shells with a chile/lime seasoning. Again the guac was phenomenal. We had the pleasure of having Zachary as our server and he was very awesome. He was super nice and personable and ensured we were good without being too overwhelming. Anyway.. I liked sumomaya for the most part, the plates were very small for the price tag but the guac and service makes up for it."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while. I have a 2 year old, so it's hard to eat at a nice restaurant. I ordered pad Thai take out. I've seen pictures in ads of what the pad Thai looks like, but what I picked up looked nothing like the picture! In fact my pad Thai had no jalape√±os or any peanuts! It had an overwhelming lime flavor. I thought maybe it would be a little spicy, but not at all. I'm pretty disappointed. It looked like a cool restaurant otherwise, but probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Great place!!  Last night was the first time for me and I will definitely go back.  Great food, great ambiance, great service, stiff drinks and a lot of good looking people.  Its no wonder why its so hard to get reservations here."}
{"text":"40 min and only an appetizer served...there's only other table but a full kitchen staff. You better like mayo!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not a big fan but a bit is ok....it's not a bit, it's a lot of mayo!!! Especially with the rock shrimp appetizer and sushi rolls.  Very cold dining as it's 69 degrees outside but cooler inside & I'm happy I wore a sweater. But with a back injury this is extremely uncomfortable that it's so chilly inside.   The Rick shrimp were taken away as we didn't like them. No questions about why we didn't eat them.   Photo of $9 tacos that took 53 min to get....needless to say we'll be stopping to eat on the way home. We don't have time to wait for more food.   Manager there but not interested in guests. PS we used to love this place and would bring a bunch of people with us. I'm done here."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, but we were not disappointed. We found the sushi fresh and the sea bass tasty. The prices were a little high, but the wait staff demonstrated the old adage, \"You get what you pay for.\" Our server was very competent and personable. Three of us shared two rolls, we each had two tacos and split the sea bass. Although the portions were small, we had no room for dessert. Next time, if we get here in time for happy hour, we'll try the bar. As it was, we had a great meal and good conversation in a clean, welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Everyone we come here it is such an enjoyable experience, especially since we have gotten to know the staff. Michelle the manager always takes extra care of me and the girls to show us a good time and make sure we are comfortable. Cheers to good service and management! We will keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Sooo...freakin...loud...whaa? My ears were ringing by the time we were done. We had trouble just shouting our order to the server...why oh why...the place already screams upbeat and fun, spare our ears with the volume!  Food is just okay. I am not a fan of tapas to begin with, but some of the dishes like the Mexican Pho is just plain weird. The only thing that's \"pho\" about it is the rice noodle.   The 2 stars are mainly for the interior design."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here one night both fell in love! First of all there is a tree in the middle of the restaurant and they were playing the original godzilla- who wouldn't love that?! The food is served family style and meant for sharing and our server did an amazing job of explaining everything and his recommendations were spot on. We had 5 dishes - The Crab Guacamole, Calamari, Korean Beef Tacos, Shaking Beef, and Kimchi Fried rice with shrimp. All of it was great! If we went back we would probably leave out the Crab Guacamole, not because it wasn't good, just that everything else was amazing and we were stuffed! The Korean beef tacos were out of this world! It had the most amazing flavor and the crispy pickled veggies on top of the beef was the perfect flavor addition! We could have these everyday! We will definitely be back and can't wait to try more"}
{"text":"SumoMaya combines a party atmosphere, a bar, and a sit down restaurant all into one. For those looking for somewhere hip to drink and/or eat, you've definitely come to the right place!  We ordered enough food quite possibly for a small army, including 2 types of guacamole, sushi rolls, ceviche, kimchee fried rice, various tacos, and chile-crab garlic noodles. The sushi roll we had (Shishito roll) was just average. The slight bitter flavor of the shishito pepper, which can be a delectable taste for the senses when roasted, didn't quite mesh with the sweetness of the kiwi + mango-habanero sauce for me. Other fusion items we had were tantalizing though. Some notable dishes were the Singapore crab noodles and the al pastor tacos. The strong flavors of the meat with seasoning contrasted well with the starch component in each dish.  For dessert, they have various options such as cheesecake, mochi, and chocolate cake.   Service was decent for a bustling and busy weekend night. One of the co-owners came by to check up on us and see how we were enjoying things, a nice touch!  Since this is such a vibrant atmosphere, it's not quite the place you'd want to take someone for an intimate evening where you can engage in deep conversation, especially when Kris Kross's \"Jump\" is playing on the loudspeakers (Admit it- you know you'd want to jump along with the music!). :)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! They have the best guacamole I've ever tasted. The asparagus and street corn were delicious. As well the fresh sushi , I had the salmon avocado roll ! The tacos were on happy 4 for $12 . We tried the fish and chicken both were great. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone. Our server Lucy was so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"So, we ate here a few months ago and I don't recall exactly what we had.  There were three vegetarians and so that narrows down the list for you.  Overall, I think we all thought the food was pretty good.  I personally really enjoyed my cocktail.  The decor and vibe were great.  I would come here again, though perhaps it wouldn't make my top 10 list."}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try this place out bc of so many friends Great reviews. We went for lunch & maybe we didn't order the right items but it wasn't as great as we had hoped. I don't think we will back :/"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Gotta try the salmon apple roll and the dorado tacos. Those tacos are the best things this side of Cabo"}
{"text":"This was such a cool place. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great.  I was disappointed when they were out of the lobster roll I ordered but everything else was good! Will recommend to friends next time they are in the area."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch twice during my stay. Nice well-lit airy location with trendy decor. First time around I tried the Guacamole with lump crab meat - amazing! It comes with a stack of tostadas and was extremely filling. Second time around I ordered the spicy tuna tacos and Steak Pepito, both solid choices. I wish the Steak Pepito had more Avocado, other than that it was very satisfying."}
{"text":"Hands down best food I've had in a long, long time. It's an Asain Mexican fusion inspired menu which features some amazing food. My best friend and I do dinner at least once a month and are always trying out new spots.  We have uniformly christened this as the official mac daddy. Here's why...  Ambiance is fantastic. When all the sliding glass doors are open the whole restaurant is patio like. With the A/C  running full blast you never feel the wretched AZ heat, yet it's like your dining al fresco. They even have a very large tree (albeit fake) inside the restaurant. Aside from at least 15 4-top tables (which I'm sure can be slid together to accommodate large parties) I saw inside, there are also few half booth half tables. Not to mention they have a large patio with booths, tables and high tops.  There's not only a sushi bar to sit at but also a \"kitchen bar\" which surrounds the open kitchen. Pretty cool. We sat a the bar ( which is rather large, and features 2 large projection television screens ) to take advantage of happy hour. Their bar stools cushioned seats with backs (plus!)  On to the food/drinks...  Their drink menu consists of 15 or so specialty cocktails. (All $2 off on happy hour) Some martinis, some frozen, some on the rocks. All have interesting ingredients that you wont find in many places. I tried the \"Coconut\" and the \"Kumquat\". Both were fantastic. They also have a lengthy sake menu. Aside from several specialty beers on draft they have \"Patron\" on draught. Ice cold tequila shots that aren't watered down? Yes please! They have a decent wine list as well.   To eat we ordered several things to share. First round was the bacon wrapped dates and wild mushroom tacos. Both were stellar. The bacon wrapped around the dates was cooked to perfection. The chorizo and queso fresco filling was warm,creamy and paired perfectly with the sweetness of the dates. It was honestly one of the best dishes I've ever had. The tacos weren't close behind in flavor and will be ordered again. (FYI during happy hour you can 4 of ANY of their tacos and a 32oz beer for $14)  Second round was the braised pork belly, coconut mussels and the mango habenero salmon ceviche. The pork belly was demolished almost instantaneously because well it's pork belly and who doesn't like pork belly!? The mussels were served in a delicious coconut, lime and ginger broth. They were the biggest mussels I have ever seen and tasted very fresh. Melted in my mouth. I just wish they were served with something to sop up the glorious nectar the mussels were served in! The salmon ceviche was decent, I wish there was more of a kick to it. Just needed something but that's probably just me. The salmon itself was very fresh though I must say.   For dessert we opted for the trio of creme brule. Kumquat, chocolate raspberry and green tea were being served that night. The green tea was my favorite. Perfect way to end a delicious meal.   Finally, our bartender Katelyn was great. She helped guide us through the menu and recommended several of the items we ordered and she was spot on! We will be back to see her!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Always lively. Great food. Got rock is my personal favorite. Great cocktails. Finally a fun restaurant to go to in paradise valley area."}
{"text":"I don't typically write reviews but after my experience last night I wanted to take the time to recognize how amazing this place was! We originally had a party of 2 and ended up last minute needing to add on 2 more to our table. The general manager came over right away and gave us an open 4 top. Now this may not seem like a huge deal but it was a Friday night during AZ restaurant week where the restaurant was booked! They were so kind and generous! And on top of that the food and service did not fall short!"}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous! A beautiful place for a date, a birthday or a group outing. There is a giant tree in the middle of the restaurant, large patio windows bringing in the Phoenix breeze, open kitchens to watch the chefs at work and a fun bar with tvs for the sports watchers. It has everything on the menu for meat eaters and vegetarians alike with really interesting spin on Asian-Latin flavors. We pretty much ordered all of the sides, shared guacamole and spicy chips, ordered a few rolls and noodle bowls and we were stuffed! For my vegetarian friends, the mushroom tacos were yummy but what I really loved were the teriyaki infused plantains, the popcorn encrusted elite, miso butter dipped edamame and guacamole. Skip the spinach and broccolini and if you're hungry, the rolls and bowls looked yummy. Service was a bit slow/sloppy but it was a busy Saturday night and the food and drinks made up for it. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Was very pleased.  The ceviche was fantastic.  Waitress made excellent recommendations and the sushi rolls were very good.  Will come back next time in town."}
{"text":"I really liked the pad Thai.  The softshell crab blt was ok but I won't order it again."}
{"text":"Super chill out place , was there on a Friday evening , excellent happy hour menu and insane cocktails .. Good for hanging out with a group of people or for dates !"}
{"text":"Brunch game so strong !   All you can eat ($29) and drink (extra $10 a person).  The food choices are delicious and you can interchange drinks throughout your meal.   Honestly one of the best kept brunch secrets in the valley.   Just be prepared.  Loud and sometimes gross bathrooms (due to people who can't handle their all you can drink options)."}
{"text":"Waited for my birthday to experience this restaurant and was so looking forward to it. Arrived at 930pm for our reservation and it was really busy(in a good way). It took 15 minutes for the server to come over and take a drink order and then carded us but never mentioned it being my birthday or anything so that pretty much means she didn't even look at the date. My dinner date assumed she was the server assistant since she only took a drink order and gave us water. It took another 10 minutes to get the drinks and then to our surprise she was our server and took our food order 20 minutes later. I was looking forward to having several courses spaced out over the night and was excited for the food. The bacon guacamole was excellent and everything I had hoped for. The 2 rolls we ordered were old and horrible. Do they premake some of these on busy nights and I just got old ones that weren't ordered? The rice was dry and hard and even the kiwi on top wasn't juicy. Server never really asked how it was jsut walked up and said are you finished and took the whole roll away just missing 2 pieces. Then we ordered some tacos and guess what? Old dry chicken that tasted horrible and the beef one was juicy but I refused to eat it out of principle since the night was so bad. At this point I had been there just under 2 hours and had only had 2 beers because she never would come around to take an order and had several dishes served that were all crap. The manager then comes over and says the server informed him we had sent back several dishes. His hands were shaking he was so nervous and I let him know it wasn't his fault he didn't prepare the meal but everything served was bad and old and a complete let down and service was bad. He offered his card to buy me a drink the next tiem I was in and walked away. Server dropped the check with everything on it and I had to tell her what I was and wasn't paying for.  PATHETIC ON ALL ACCOUNTS IN EVERY WAY!"}
{"text":"Came to this cool, hip place for happy hour with a friend and was not disappointed!   Absolutely love that there is a huge tree in the middle of the restaurant, the kitchen and sushi line is completely open, the patio is gorgeous and high tech, and the color pops and artificial grass throughout the patio.  Ordered the tacos, calamari, and one roll. Favorite item was for sure the calamari.   Our service was great and our server gave us great suggestions, only wish she would've told us her name!   Fantastic place for happy hour and drinks. Will surely return.  5/5"}
{"text":"If I had 10 stars I would give them 10! This place is sooooi delicious. We had a tiradito that was to die for! We also had two amazing rolls: the Maya and the rock shrimp and some charred  edemame. For dessert we had the tres leches  and it was . simply perfect! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service!!! The manager was very kind and the atmosphere was awesome. Get the Ahi Tuna appetizer"}
{"text":"Just a friendly FYI, BUT still a fan, sushi menu has changed and $$ went up and up. Why is it when my friend and I always find a new place, start become regulars and menu and prices change, all within 2 weeks since we were there... so sad!   My friend and I come here at lunch for the sushi. Last time we were here, I ordered the Chirashi Bowl, 14 pieces of chef choice fish, it was good not fantastic, presentation lacking, creativity lacking, that was 2 weeks ago!  We came yesterday for a late lunch Happy Hour, had to sit at the bar area for HH. We took advantage of the menu along with ordering some of our favorite Sushi, didn't bother checking the sushi menu because we always order the same items, Uni, Yellow Tail, Salmon, Eel Nigiri. When the order came. We had half our sushi, unknowingly they changed the menu and increased all pricing, now PRICE per piece! Uni doubled in $$  Food was still good, service at the bar at HH was excellent, just not so Happy with menu changes and $$ change for sushi."}
{"text":"Four words: Pad Thai Al Pastor. Plus, *beautiful* hostess, super hot bartenders (male and female), and slick deco with a New York feel to it. I'm a nerd. A foodie nerd! And SumoMaya hit the spot, as my gf would say. P.S.: try the burros y mulas cocktails. Eat your heart out, NYC."}
{"text":"Foodie adventure for lunch. Done and done! Everything we had was amazing due mostly in part Bc of Danielle, our server's recommendations. The best of the best was the Pork Belly drizzled with butterscotch sauce accompanied by red roasted grapes topped with a balsamic glaze. Simply to die for!! Manuel the GM made himself available and was a pleasure to chat with as well. We'll be back soon. Thank you for a great experience!"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Sumo-Maya.  My wife and I wanted to try it our as we were nearby for a movie.    First let me begin by acknowledging our awesome, helpful and humble server (Anna).  She was great and super funny with the banter.   Food was tasty and very unique. The atmosphere was hip with great music playing.   Food/Grades: We had Mexican Shrimp Cocktail (B+), Kimchee fried rice (A), chilean sea bass (B+ ) and Pacifico-soy carne asada (A) and mussels (C).    I think Sumo-Maya is a great atmosphere with some promising creative culinary ideas.  I look forward as their menu evolves."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night and it was just want I wanted ! The food is amazing. I can't wait to come back and try more. The ambiance is a 10, as is the music! Our service was also top notch considering how busy it was. I've also been to heir bottomless brunch which is an absolute must. One of the best brunches I've had in awhile. I plan on taking all of my out of town guests here"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere. Good variety menu. Not too pricey. I like the tapas style so you can try a litle bit of everything"}
{"text":"Brunch is good in theory but food was ok. I like the unlimited aspect and the drinks are great especially for $10 unlimited just had higher hopes for quality of food. Quac however got this place a whole star itself get that"}
{"text":"5 star decor 2.5 star food 3.5 star service 2 star prices.  Def trying too hard, as other people have noted. Went for brunch. Mostly empty. While the food sounds interesting it's overall tasteless and too cute.  All the guacs are small and overpriced. Not to mention not that tasty. The 6 small Greasy pita type squares don't help.  Only two hot sauces??? No salt or pepper shakers on tables??   Chillaquiles is a MUST MISS! Basically a plate of super thick nachos with two small eggs on top.  A serious mess.  Chopped salad has way too many ingredients and is too small for $15.  Pork Benedict served on too thick and too sweet muffins. And a stupid Palm leaf under all that?! Again...trying too hard!!!!  Service was hit and miss. Main server was great for awhile and disappeared for stretches. As did the water person.  Like the huge TVs above the bar but get the impression they're on soccer all the time.  Overall this is...meh..."}
{"text":"I've been to Sumomaya 3-4 times. I enjoy the fun decor and ambience. Really nothing like this anywhere in town so I like taking out of town guests here too.  I'm not a fan of seafood and I like the variety they over on the menu and they are accommodating with tweaking dishes. My last visit I had the kimchee fried rice and they were able to add chicken to it - yum! My husband had the Pad Thai with chicken instead of pork - yum (although he likes the tacos more). Also had the guacamole with pomegranate - yum! I love the Green \"Magic\" Mojito which I look forward to. My friend had sushi and really enjoyed it too. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OK, this is our third visit and while I loved it on the first visit, it's definitely now too weird.   The good: - the servers are mostly excellent. - the food is yummy (for the most part).  - appreciated the call in advance to say that the patio would be closed and there might a long wait to get seated.   The bad:  - we had a 7PM reservation. Got there at 6:45 and we were seated promptly. However, food ordered at 7 or maybe 7.15 did not appear until 8PM. One person in our company of 4 received his sushi rolls and tacos at 7.30 but the rest of the group didn't see food until 8PM.   - The food last night was ok. Not bad, not great. Might be because the restaurant was pretty busy.  - loud... it's loud and it gets louder as the night goes on as they have a DJ pumping out music so loud that we couldn't hear each other. It's truly obnoxious (do you really need some hipster kid pumping out thumping tunes from his MacBook air).  - our table was seated under a air conditioning unit dropping a lot of condensation- we were literally being rained on. Told our server several timed - he told us what it was and shrugged his shoulders.   - This place attracts all of the Scottsdale 30k millionaires.   Finally, Sumo Maya has to decide what it is. Is it a sports bar? (Big TVs showing college football).  Is it a restaurant? Is it a night club. I bet it's making a ton of money for the owner - that won't last long.   If you want to avoid the worst of the worst about this place - get there early."}
{"text":"Fabulous!!! This is my third time here and I will continue to come back. The food is so amazing. I haven't had a bad dish yet. I have always come in a group of 4 or more and we order lots of dishes to share with the table. That is the best way to dine here because the food comes out when it is ready,not timed to all come out together. If you are each ordering your own dish and hope to eat at the same time you may be diasappointed.   I have had many differnet dishes and my favorites have been the Crispy Chicken Mole, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Shaking Beef and Filet.  There are so many dishes to chose from. The fusion flavors are so unique, like the Asian inspired seasoning on the Shaking Beef with a Cilantro Lime dipping sauce.The service is very good also, since we order many dishes, they area alwasy clearing platres and bringing new ones.  This is a very popular place with music/DJ some evenings si it is noisy. If you come early you may not have to wait for a table but if you come afte 8:00 you will most definielty have to wait. And that is on a weeknight. ."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! Chaufa rice had so many layers of flavors... chili crab noodles wicked hot...appetizers were awesome.  Drinks yummy.  Vibrant atmosphere.  Great waitresses.  Nice selection for vegetarians as well. There is something here for everyone"}
{"text":"Probably not fair to review since we left without eating.  It was so LOUD.  The music was shaking the glasses.  The server had to bend over the table and shout  \"do you want STILL WATER OR BOTTLED WATER..\". That did, it we were out the damn door.  WHY do place feel they have to make you DEAF to eat there??????  Really?  Maybe I will order take out if they agree to bring it out to the parking lot.   Oh, and that is already a nightmare, with another restaurant yet to open there soon.."}
{"text":"Wow I have been to few restaurants as interesting as this one. Mexican Asian fusion. Huh. I came with a group of 4 girls on a Thursday night. We wanted to get happy hour prices but they only serve that in the bar area and there were no seats. We shared a lot of small plates. We started with the pomegranate guac which was great, and I liked the chips it came with. They were very big round, freshly fried tortilla chips. The veggie roll was good with a big slice of avocado on top. The pho was interesting. Not my favorite, it did not resemble pho whatsoever. It tasted like warm salsa. We also got the beef tacos (bomb!) and chicken tacos, also delicious. The kimchi rice was also good. The server forgot about our rice until we almost had to leave, but we really wanted to try it so we hung around for them to finally bring it out. The service could have been better, our guy seemed a little aloof. My green tea was empty for too long, too many times. But interesting food, and beautiful, cool environment."}
{"text":"I am editing my initial review and adding a star.  The reason being I think I posted my first draft in a \"Scottsdale Douchey\" tone that is not my style.   Also I think I neglected to point out the highlights.    But also have you ever seen a movie that you didn't think much of when you left the theatre but a week later realized it was better than you thought.    So here's the good:  Mojito thing was crazy good.  Mushroom tacos where amazing.  Service was excellent.  The mango habanero sauce they leave on tables I practically drank (should bottle that stuff up).   The bad:  I was disappointed in the guacamole but now I realize it was just guacamole. I mean how good or different could it be.  Also the mole wasn't as saucy as I'd like and the plantains were indistinguishable from the chicken which was dry.   The ugly:   The tres leche dessert was a disaster.  Not a good note to finish on. I've heard others claim it was great so maybe we had an off batch.    The decor is great though acoustics are bad but that wasn't a bad thing as it gave the space energy.    We also ordered sushi and I think it was pricey for what it was and while it wasn't bad, it also didn't blow mind.   I think for sure we need to go back and explore other options on the menu.    Perhaps the most constructive critique I could give would be to simplify the menu and offer fewer choices, but put more heart and soul into every item"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed in this place, everything I get is super yummy and I will definitely be back soon!!"}
{"text":"First things first: Make a reservation. I decided to play it safe and reserve a table for 6:00 p.m. on Saturday evening. At first I thought I was probably over-cautious with a reservation so early, but the dining room was packed! I think the only available seating was around the bar, which was humming.  As everyone else says, the space is open, colorful, breezy and beautiful. I loved every little detail--the vases, lights, knick-knacks, intricate metal candle holders, all with a heavy dose of bright magenta pink and orange. It was trendy and welcoming and just right. The open garage door walls made for perfect summer dinner ambiance.  Our server was sweet and explained the menu thoroughly, and gave us some recommendations. Our haul:  -Sake sangria for me: sake, cucumber vodka, ginger, other assortment of flavors to make for an absolutely refreshing cocktail  -Traditional guacamole (I'm eyeballing the pomegranate/dried fruit gauc for next time) and house-fried chips. This was magnificent. The queso fresco and citrus notes of the chunky guac made it some of the best I've ever had in a restaurant. To be honest, I think it's a little silly that you only receive 5 chips in total (and they are amazing--crispy and perfectly seasoned) and another order of chips is $1. But I don't want that to take away from how delicious this dish was.  -Mushroom tacos: Perfect little street tacos with AMAZING smoky-grilled mushrooms. These were perfection. I could eat about 10 of these, if left to my own devices. I put a little leftover guacamole on mine---tastebud party.  -Shishito peppers: Shishitos have become a personal obsession of mine over the past year and if they are on the menu, you can bet I will order them. The ample portion came tossed in a delicious soy caramel glaze. Word to the wise, these are marked as Vegetarian on their menu, but are topped with bonito flake (dried fish flakes). Seeing as I'm becoming increasingly \"meh\" in my vegetarianism, I just ate the ones on the bottom. I wasn't passing up these beauts!  Finally, I chose the sumo green roll to round out the meal. A perfect portion of a veggie roll, topped with a tasty tomatillo salsa. Boyfriend had the lamb chop, which I thought was a teensy bit tiny for $12, but he said it was absolutely delicious.   We thought we couldn't handle any other food, but then our gal ran through the dessert list. HOLY. We ended up on their take of a tres leches cake, topped with toasted whipped cream, drenched in what seemed like melted ice cream (I'm sure there is a more fancy word for this) with a side of chocolate crispies (again, I'm sure something fancier than what I'm describing). It was honestly? Life changing. The other desserts sounded just as amazing. Mexican chocolate lava cake with a horchata drizzle? Trio of paletas?!  All in all, what a perfect addition to the neighborhood. If I'm feeling like a special occasion dinner, I'm probably choosing Sumo Maya!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! When my husband first mentioned that this restaurant was a mix of Japanese and Mexican, I was like what? a Japanese/mexican fusion restaurant blended together...lol! Interesting mix but, never heard of it! But, I'm glad we went. I love the decor, love the atmosphere, the sushi selection was yummy, and their ramen was good...Nice place"}
{"text":"The space is open.  This allows for good people watching.  The open space also makes it a little loud.  You should be prepared to exert extra efforts to hold a conversation.    We ordered a mix of dishes, including fried rice, ramen, tacos, and some rolls.  Everything tastes really good.  You can't expect traditional flavors.  If you're open to different taste profiles applied to conventional dishes, you will enjoy the food.  Servers were nice.  We were also pleased with the speed of service.  The food came out quickly.  We never felt like we were waiting for food."}
{"text":"Our experience on the night was a sort of 3.5 star experience - so with the confused service rounded down to a 3.  The service team seemed a little out of sorts all night long.   A little too much of a \"scene\" for my liking, but the food was inventive and well executed. More Asian than Latin in the fusion blend.  Enjoyed the Duck Rice special and both the coconut tuna tartar and the tuna tostado (which we didn't order - but then was comp-ed)."}
{"text":"I am so so glad that the management encouraged us to return after our first experience there. Thank you Jason for making that happen. I am also glad to report that our experience was totally different! Kiki was a very informed attentive server. She made some great suggestions, describing the food exactly how it would present. We really loved everything she suggested for us. I also  appreciate that she knew what exactly was in the dishes so we knew whether it would be something too spicy, etc.  All of our dishes came out perfectly timed. We really enjoyed the fusion of Mexican and Asian and were totally full when we left. There was a very nice crowd for early Friday evening, nice vibe!  We shall return!! Thank you again Jason and crew...."}
{"text":"Has anyone wonder what happened to the service here? Takes 4 girls 15 minutes to figure out how to seat us and the place wasn't even busy. Then another 20 minutes to bring us water and take our order. My husband got his meal and finished and mine came out 20 minutes later. I used to love this place for food and service."}
{"text":"I went to this place and ordered sushi rolls, nigiri, and sashimi.  The nigiri and sashimi were both very fresh.  The rolls I ordered, the Red Dragon and Lobster mango were both good but incredibly pricey.  This is a great place to eat if you are willing to pay a little extra money."}
{"text":"Few places really deliver on 'Asian Fusion', and SumoMaya was one of those that didn't. The 'fusion' dishes just tasted like asian food gone awry.   We started with the the Pumpkin Seed Guacamole which was good, but nothing particularly different/unique I was excited about the Sushis since they seemed really interesting, but the Soft Shelled Crab roll just didn't deliver. I'm normally someone who loves all the specialty sushi rolls I eat, but the flavor combinations just didn't match up and notes accentuated in the wrong places.  We also tried the Al Pastor Pad Thai. My fiancee loves pad thai and loves his Al Pastor, but again the medley just didn't work for us.  The only dish we liked was our side - the Miso Eggplant, which was well flavored.   Great cocktail, margarita, beer and wine menu. I liked my Coconut cocktail which kind of tasted like a melted pina colada.  We also felt we overpaid for the quality and taste of the food. $80 for not enjoying our main dishes was not a good eal. Too many other great small plates places in the Scottsdale area.   The ambience is also confusing. It's swanky and would be a neat place to hang out but it was also trying too hard to be a Vegas nightclub. There's a DJ on his laptop upon entry, playing club music that made me want to dance on the tables, but also sports showing on TVs above the bar.  Not a good place for a first date or anything where you want to hear the other person."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding..Our service was great. Extremely busy place..parking is hard.. Looks like Happy Hour is a big draw?"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the food. The food was honestly disgusting. We ordered guacamole & it was hardly mashed with chunks of hard avocado & very bland. The chicken street taco had this sesame Asian sauce on it which did not mix with the Mexican style taco & was nasty. The snow crab rolls were okay besides for the unbelievably spicy wasabi ginger sauce that came with it & did not taste good. The edamame was probably the grossest thing we ordered with this horrible sauce on it. Just awful. &the shaking beef was pretty bland as well with similar weird sauce the edamame had. Don't come here if you are wanting good food..."}
{"text":"Incredible, incredible flavors. We were a large party and gave our server a price per head. She brought us a seemingly non-stop variety of dishes from Filet to Shrimp to Sea Bass.  There were guacamole varieties that blew us away. This is a must if you like the flavors of Mexican and or Asian cuisine."}
{"text":"If you like to hang out at trendy places this spot is for you. They did good job on interior, food on the other hand was ok. There was nothing we tried that made a huge impression. We had couple appetizers : guacamole and chips , tuna tacos , street corn topped with popcorn and cheese dip with onions , peppers and corn tortillas. I had lobster noodles for my meal , which on description was described as pasta topped with lobster sauce, they basically topped noodles with peas , carrots and couple pieces of lobster. Would never order this dish again. Drinks probably are the stronger part of this place. We really enjoyed spicy peach and jalape√±o margaritas."}
{"text":"Food was solid. Restaurant was high energy loud and fun. Drinks were very good and the staff was fun"}
{"text":"Came here last night for Restaurant Week, and it was fantastic!  First of all, their RW menu offered so many more choices than other restaurants, so that was great.  I had the rock shrimp tempura, Mexican street corn, and pad Thai.  All were delicious!  I order street corn pretty much whenever I see it on a menu, and theirs was exceptional.  My friend also had a beef dish that was delicious. Another friend had the seabass, also amazing.  Service was great as well.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food here is really good! I tried their enchiladas suizas, one of the best I've had. Bacon guacamole was delicious.   Cons: I would rate this place a 5 star however, service was horrible. We were waiting for 2 other guests and they did sit is down where we waited for 15-20 min, no one offered us any waters or a drink. Our waiter must have had a bad day. He was rude and not helpful. He brought us the wrong tacos which is ok, easy fix right? WRONG...took him another 20 min to bring ONE taco. He forgot a juice order for a baby. No apology he said, \"do you still want it?\" When we are leaving? Horrible service bur I am willing to give this place another try.  Hint: When someone asks a question about your menu please be courteous. Asian/Mexican is a new thing for some people."}
{"text":"SumoMaya is definitely the spot to go for awesome ambience, great decoration and yummy fusion of two worlds - Hispanic and Asian. Wow the pork belly ramen bowl is da bomb especially when you add a traditional egg where when broken, thick gooey egg yolk oozes out and mixes with the soup making the experience feel like you're sitting in a small ramen house in the middle of Nagoya but you're not, you're in the dessert! Ha! The Korean tacos is phenomenal as it meshed traditional marinated Korean beef and the Hispanic fixings of a traditional taco. Wash your food down with a Sake Sangria and you are good to go! Now...if only this place fuses a dish from the Philippines, now that would be nice especially when one of it's roots is Spanish."}
{"text":"Took my daughter for her birthday. Have been a couple times before that. Fun atmosphere and staff. Great food and service! Interesting combinations of unique sushi and  dishes. Have fun!"}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars every night of the week! I went last night (sunday) and it was packed with people! The server was so helpful, she explained food to us, turned off heaters, had fast response time...She made the experience for me and my girl...  The people next to us were awesome too! We ordered the rock shrimp roll, the crab meat guacamole, the tuna tacos and the tres leche cake! everything was immaculate and up to expectation.. The only thing i left unsure of was whether i liked the layout and scenery of the restaurant or the food better..?"}
{"text":"I decided to come here for my birthday and it was everyone's first time. I had a group of 8 and we had a great time. The food was amazing and I loved the fusion of flavors. Everyone at my table was impressed and all want to come back to try everything else. Just an FYI this is a tapas place so expect to have smaller portions. The idea here is to order a bunch of different things and share amongst everyone. We all left full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere, great food and the Magic Mojito is definitely one of the best drinks I've ever had!"}
{"text":"this place is bomb. whenever I try to impress someone, this is the spot i choose. this is for several reasons  1) Its so versatile. Great drinks. Small plates. Two types of cuisines (Mexican + Pan-Asian) plus a sushi bar. Great drinks menu. Thus, you can go many different routes- big feasts, nibbles+drank, sushi night, on and on and on  2) Shut up and get these things: Chile Crab Garlic Noodles. And the Pork Belly (or is it Bacon or is it Chicaron ?) guac.   3) cool pop art feel. lots of bright colors. Warholian screen print-ish images. and a bright blue tree right in the center of the restaurant. it fascinates me every time and I am going to steal that idea and get a blue tree in my house (when i own a home)  4) the service is top notch. I make friends with the staff every time.   if you are fun, this place is fun. so, be fun and have fun here"}
{"text":"The food is superb. The atmosphere is hip and fun. But the best is the service. The managers have always been accommodating every time we go. We even brought our infant daughter to happy hour once and he nicely gave us a table to help us out so we didn't have to have her at the bar!"}
{"text":"I wanted to update my review because I visited this restaurant again to give it another try this week. It's so close to home and I did think the concept of the restaurant was cool. It was happy hour so that started off cool the bar was packed so I found a seat and immediately made small talk with patrons. Attempted small talk with bartender he was pretty bland so I moved on. My friends that I was meeting arrived we sat at a high table. We ordered plenty of drinks and I ordered food. I asked for no tofu add chicken I got tofu and burnt chicken. Told waitress she was unbothered. Service was HORRIBLE 25-30 minutes to get each round. Maybe more. After spending about $250 and some guy who claimed he was the manager approached us and asked are you guys leaving soon? I asked why? He said we have  people waiting for tables so I was trying to see how long. We hadn't even finished our last round of drinks. Horrible. We quickly paid and left and told everyone we encountered the next day. Place is fun and cool, drinks are good, food mediocre service THE WORST. Of the 5 of us NOBODY said they ever wanna hang there again. I don't know how this place has such great ratings because in my book if service is bad you can't get above a 3."}
{"text":"Gotta special date? or just want to go somewhere cool! @sumomayaaz is the place to do that!! The aesthetics of the Asian-Mexican fusion is awesome. Sushi mixed with southwestern flavors and the other way around. Pictured above is the sushi chef special, and the bottom is Spicy Tuna Tacos. All delicious I recommend it if your in central Scottsdale.  #sushiAZ #AZsushi #AZfoodie #ScottsdaleEats #SumoMayaAZ #mexicanAsian #fusionfood #phxeats #sushigram #foodie"}
{"text":"An absolute amazing Sunday brunch!  An entree served with all-can-eat appetizers and desserts. Everything we tried (7 dishes) was fabulous.  Service was spot on. And, the coup de grace --- for $10 you get bottomless mimosas, bloody marys, draft beer, etc. The only downside for us old folks was that it was too noisy, though the DJ's playlist was superb."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY! You wouldn't think it would work. But it does. In many ways.  Mirin was an amazing server. And when I asked her to explain the \"evil ways\" of this confounding menu... she walked me through the maze of all roads lead to good. REALLY REALLY R E A L L Y GOOD. We stayed away from sushi, because, well, it's sushi. And started with a guac. If you eat NOTHING else off the menu, order the calabacitas guacamole. A thick \"porridge\" of corn, calabacita (squash), Oaxaca, and other deliciousness, coats a flavorful and creamy guacamole in this creamy/cheesy umami-packed guacamole and freshly pressed and fried tostadas. Made our knees weak.   We sampled a ceviche, traditional, chock full of perfect squid, crab meat, shrimp, beets in a flavorful tomato broth - light and scented with olive oil. Ceviche at its very best. Tacos are tiny, another one of their small plate offerings and also delicately large on flavor - so the tempura fish delicate and crispy was dressed in many layers of flavor. That is their \"secret\" layering flavors that are somehow related... but not, and making it work. Which bring me to the \"real deal\" mole in the crispy chicken mole - a take on general tsao's chicken. Flown in from Veracruz, they toss the chicken chunks in this richly flavorful sauce, served with sticky rice, sweet and green plantains.  Sorcery? Maybe. Whatever it is... it works. In big bold ways. In delicate and heated ways. Any way you cut it, delicious. And the staff? Wonderful! Kitchen, including Chef and his left and right folks? AMAZINGLY down to earth and happy people, serving happy and sexy food."}
{"text":"Was fortunate to enjoy the happy hour tacos. I'm impressed with their fusion of Japan and Mexico culinary artistry. Flowers in tacos, I wasn't expecting to tango with a flurry of flavors. So good!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Cool vibe. can't wait to come back. Some of the best and unique sushi I've had in a long time. Stacks well even against the many offerings in Vegas. Surprised me since the food in Scottsdale often doesn't compare to the best of Vegas. Hope these expand across the valley and to other cities. Cool spot."}
{"text":"I felt like I was in Vegas! The vibe was hip, and the decor was trendy (complete with indoor trees!). The menu is a fusion of Asian and Mexican, which went surprisingly well together. My hubby and I are pretty adventurous, so we just ordered the omakase, which was GREAT (just the right amount of food, maybe a smidge too much, but that's always a good thing).  This place would be PERFECT for a celebration - birthday, bachelorette dinner, etc. A little loud to really converse, but that's not the point...   Tip: We were not able to get a last minute reservation by calling or through open table, but Amex concierge hooked us up."}
{"text":"OMG this place shouldn't work but it does!  The Mexican Japanese fusion is divine!  Amazing flavors, not too heavy, and huge menu selection.  We especially loved the Shaking beef, Pad Thai, white fish ceviche, shishito peppers, and the apple salmon sushi roll.  Our service was outstanding as well.  Cocktails are plentiful -- the Sumo 75 was especially refreshing.   Note, they have indoor and patio dining.  While the DJ was awesome, the sound inside on a Saturday night was way too loud and so we preferred being on the patio where they have fans and misters.  You could still hear the music, just not as pounding!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The decor, the ambience and the asian-mex fusion food is incredible! I want to try everything on the Menu. Also, they have Patron on tap! I want to be a regular here."}
{"text":"Amazing food! So fresh I could eat there again and again! Love the variety and the mix of Mexican and Asian cuisines! They go very well together. Our waitress was great too wonderful service! We'll be a back!!!"}
{"text":"I was stoked when I walked in the door to this place...only to be royally disappointed by the staff/service. I'll keep it short and sweet...don't go here if you have a group of more than 6, and whatever you do don't ask the checks to be split from the start. Your waiter/waitress will give you a snotty look then proceed to tell you that you can't pay with more than 6 cards. Oh wait, the waitress didn't even do that, she went and got the manager (completely rude and unhappy guy from my perspective) who proceeds to tell you \"it's too hard to split it because the servings are shared.\" We proceeded to get horrible service after that point. It actually all started before when we tried to make a reservation and were told we would have to wait 3 hours for 13 people. The place was empty and clearly they didn't want the group. I could keep going about how horrible it was but I said short and sweet and already said a ton. Never again will this place get our money. Two large sports teams from the area will be sure to spread the word about how they SHOULDN'T go here. Epic disappointment!"}
{"text":"Their weekend bottomless brunch deal is a big winner. However, on my recent trip the food wasn't as good as I remembered it in the past and the cava they use for their mimosas was disappointing. I don't expect them to use veuve cliquot, but get something more sparkling. A good place to go to get drunk on a Sunday funday but in terms of quality they are lacking quality juice and cava. Their food is also hit and miss like I mentioned earlier. I enjoy their pomegranate guacamole and black bean hummus is interesting and works. The enchiladas suiza were decent, but the sushi roll I tried was underwhelming. Not sure why they even serve sushi, they're trying to do too much."}
{"text":"Sorry guys but tonight's visit was a complete fail!    We went with another couple to celebrate a few April's bdays. 3 of us got our entrees at about the same time but the 4th person had to wait a bit longer. We even had to mention it again to the waiter to see why it was taking so long. Once we did get the last entree we had to send it back. The \"it's not that spicy\" was WAY TO SPICY.    The big surprise was when we got our check. We paid 29.00 for an entree and when the waiter asked if she wanted rice, neglected to tell us that fried rice was an additional 8.00?? Say what? Sorry but that's just a bit much for an already overpriced entree.   Lastly, I asked that my entree be boxed so that I could take it home and instead, it was thrown out. They did the right thing and took it off our tab. They said they'd make it again but it was the missing entree earlier and we were ready to go.   Just not a good visit this time and there's plenty more restaurants out there to give a try so I think this will be our last trip for some time.  The food is way too pricey for what you get. I think they've got some work to do."}
{"text":"This place is totally bizarre and yet wonderful!   My date wanted sushi and I wanted Mexican food, so we decided to try it and entwine the best of both worlds. I have to admit I was skeptical due to the fact that these food genres couldn't be more different. I was pleasantly surprised with all the different options on the menu that made both of our tastebuds happy! The plates are small and perfect for sharing. We had several sushi rolls, tacos, a shrimp dish, and a few other things that were all delicious. The sushi was great and the Mexican food was too! The atmosphere is very cool and perfect to watch a game or have a romantic evening out. The only con I have is that it's pretty pricey for the small portions.   I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great fusion. Food seemed fresh. Sushi, fish tacos, & chicken mole & plantains all were great."}
{"text":"It was a birthday dinner for my youngest who turned 22.  As a party of seven, we made reservations early.  This was my first time, although I've always wanted to try SumoMaya to see what it is like.  I'm happy to say, I came away quite pleased.  We arrived on time for our dinner and we were seated quickly.  With 7 of us, we had trouble deciding what to drink or eat, but Candace, our server, took it in stride and gave us our space.  The dining room is large and open, and a bit noisy, so for a hearing-impaired person, expect difficulty conversing.   Eventually we got around to ordering drinks and appetizers.  I had the \"Perfect\" margarita, and yes, it was perfect.  For apps, we had Shishito peppers, Mexican Street Corn, Pomegranate Guacamole and the girls all had some variation of sashimi.  ALL of these were excellent and the only complaint was with the crispy tortilla shells that were delivered.  They were kinda stingy with these, despite us having two appetizers that needed them.  The street corn was a bit unusual in flavor, but not bad, and presentation of everything was exceptional.  We had a mix of vegetarians and meat-eaters at the table, and Candace's recommendation was that we order two or more entrees each and pass them around.  Yeah, but at $29, $32 with noodles added for the VN Shaking Beef, I am wont to share.  The wife had Chilled Green Tea Soba noodles, and while she said it was good, she also said she would not order it again.  FSIL had the Pork \"Al Pastor\" Pad Thai, and while it was shy on pork, it was a tasty dish. Other dishes were the Seafood Fried Rice, and Kimchee Fried Rice, both of which were enjoyed.  Apparently there was an issue with the Seafood Fried Rice, which is described as a \"Paella\" type dish, and it included Chicken, which was not mentioned on the menu.  The vegetarian diner pointed this out and the dish was quickly replaced, sans chicken.  when I mentioned it was a birthday dinner, Candace was ready with a birthday dessert, and told me that since there was an issue with the Paella, they would be comping two desserts.    Dinner was excellent, and made more so by the most excellent service from Candace, she was available when we needed her, but hands-off otherwise, which suited us perfectly.  A huge thanks to Candace for making this dinner exceptional.  Would I go back?  Most Definitely."}
{"text":"SumoMaya is one of my favorite places to eat in Scottsdale. The decor is beautiful and the food is amazing! Also a great place to go for happy hour. One of my favorites is The guacamole with crap meat! Five stars for SumoMaya."}
{"text":"In order of tastiest to still-good-but-not-as-tasty:  - guac (pomegranate and ribeye were easily the best two) - shishito pepper roll (kiwi on top!) - billion roll (only order if you're on an expense account...you'll see) - lobster mango roll - Korean beef taco - kimchi rice - smoked edamame - ceviche - fish taco  I'm forgetting a few things but I get the feeling you can't really go wrong here.   Even the lowest stuff on the list was really good, I just force ranked them for fun.   Can't comment on the drinks, though my coworkers loved the green tea cocktail and the sidecar. Also can't comment on entrees, as we stuck to apps only.   Overall, great spot to try a bunch of different things. Really cool atmosphere and giant projector screens that play sports near the bar."}
{"text":"What a great experience!! Everything about this place was great. Food was amazing. Drinks were unique and fun. Service exceeded any reasonable expectation. \"Anna\" or \"Ahna\" was expeditious and gracious. It didn't hurt that she was also hilarious. I can't remember the last time we laughed so hard. We had a great experience!!"}
{"text":"This food has a twist of Asian and Mexican, which the restaurant excuted both cultures so well. The tastes that they incorporated into the dishes were amazing!!! We got lobster and mango roll, ahi tuna appetizer, pork tacos, and mahi mahi tacos (my favorite.) We also got the chocolate dessert and another dessert pictured I do not remember the name, but delicious.."}
{"text":"What an interesting place. First just the decor very modern asiany zen style with the giant tree near the bar, the funky chairs with heads printed on the backseat.  We didn't make a reservation so we ended sitting at the bar which was totally fine, comfy seats and great bar table length.  The food itself was pretty good! The fusion Mexican Asian was pretty interesting but I thought everything went well together. This place is tapas style so we got to order a bunch of dishes. On top of my head I remember the ceviche, the guac, the tacos and the kimchi fried rice.  It's definitely a fun place to have drinks and food. If you are not in the \"party\" mood I would go some place else because the music and the place itself gets pretty loud. It was a bit challenging to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Mexican-Asian fusion is not very common so I was very excited. Food quality and flavors were good. Vibe was trendy and fresh. Service was slow especially since we went at 2pm and it wasn't busy. Standout dish is the Chili Garlic Crab Noodles and the Suzuki roll was good too."}
{"text":"Dates - Excellent  Spiced Popcorn - ok Shishito peppers - Excellent  Chic garron de Pollo - Not great Mushroom tacos - ok Salmon avocado - good Ckn taco - not good  Miso eggplant - yum Cal hand roll - yum"}
{"text":"WOW!!!! This place is amazing! Last night was my first time and I was very impressed. The decor is beautiful, sets a great atmosphere. The food was very good. We started with the mexican street corn, the flavors were great. I highly recommend the mussels and the mexican pho!!!! I will definitely be dining at sumo maya again!"}
{"text":"Great place for a group dinner with friends. The small plate menu is diverse and should appeal to most all tastes. The guacamole is particularly good as are the sushi rolls and ceviche if you're a seafood person. Margaritas were great and plentiful. Their indoor / outdoor open seating is awesome with the evening cooling down. Will be back"}
{"text":"Amazing Mexican and Asian infusion with good service.  We saw this as we were driving and I'm so glad we stopped.  Everything was amazing and we tried a lot. Order many plates and share because everything we had is worth trying. Blanca was our server and was a great help with suggestions and making sure we had everything we needed. She was so patient while we kept adding on more and more. Come hungry, there will me so much for you to try. The mexican street corn with popcorn is amazing. The steak pepita torta was mouth watering. The rolla chingon was amazing and unique. The korean tacos are a must. Love the atmosphere here.  A very eclectic place with lots to choose from including drinks. The loaded mule was refreshing. The tres leches cake I'm eating right now and all I can say is Wow!"}
{"text":"Loved the cultural mix in foods!   Sumo Maya is a fantastic place for a party or group gathering. It's eclectic, loud, fun, and it still has a laid back feel.   I had a small gathering at Sumo Maya for my 24th birthday and it was a great experience!   MAJIC MOJITOS!!! Please try one! You may become addicted!   The only con that I experienced was that we made a reservation for 10pm for 8-10 people. We arrived about 15 mins early and even 15 mins after we were still not say in out reserved table. The server directed us for drinks at the bar and the attentiveness of the bartenders was not up to par. Other than that, our outing at Sumo Maya was great!"}
{"text":"I am posting a revised review.  I had been @ SumoMaya a few months ago and had a bad experience.  I  posted a negative review. The management got in touch with me right away and offered a re-do for me and a guest.  Good customer relations!  I live in New York, so it took me awhile to take advantage of Brittani's offer.  However, on my next visit, I returned to SumoMaya. I am happy to say that I had an excellent meal this time.  The food and service were top notch.  The menu is filled with so many appealing choices I had a very hard time deciding what to order. I look forward to trying their brunch the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"This place is really cool.  The environment and ambiance is very upbeat and creative.  A really nice place.  The food was very flavorful and unique.  Don't expect to get full on one dish though.  Tried about three different things before not being hungry anymore.  I believe that is the style of this place though.  Went on a Friday night and the clientele were all over 28 years old, clean, and dressed nicely.  Seemed like the cool, trendy place to go in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'm from LA and visited Scottsdale for my first time. I'm used to cute, trendy restaurants but this ambiance, decor, and unique fusion of food was so refreshing and delicious! I had the apple salmon sushi and the coconut soup. Amazing . We were celebrating our friend's birthday and there seemed to be 3 other birthdays in the same outdoor patio. Needless to say, this place is a great place to celebrate. Loved the birthday cake sparkler as well, however that dessert wasn't my favorite , people didn't really touch it . But overall, I loves this place and wish there was more places like this in LA !"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing!  They're fresh, creative, and very flavorful.  They have the BEST pad thai I have ever tasted.  The place itself is nice and trendy.  It gets packed on weekends, so it does get loud.  I've decided against it a couple of times because of the noise level, but I couldn't help but go back for the food."}
{"text":"This is a really awesome fusion restaurant. The popcorn made with tajin and truffle oil is so worth it for the flavor combination. The chicken and Korean beef tacos are bomb.com. Our bartender/server was Erika, she was very informative and let us know about all of the ingredients and flavors in our choices!  Ps;get the popcorn"}
{"text":"Best margarita of my life. I came back 2 nights in a row. And I'll go back next time I'm in the area.  The ambiance is also lovely.  So was the service."}
{"text":"Everything about my experience here was positive. The hostess was very nice, the environment was fantastic, server was friendly and knowledgeable, interesting and delicious food and refreshing cocktails.  The place was bustling on a Wednesday night    I had the Shishito Peppers and the Pad Thai and both were delicious.  Probably some of the best Pad Thai I've ever eaten. I thought the prices were spot on.   Great food, great service, great atmosphere, and fair prices. I would never have suspected this for a restaurant located in a strip shopping center."}
{"text":"Was not too impressed with this place. Not bad but not something to write home about as far as the food goes.  The atmosphere is very nice though.  Lots of people"}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour one night. Good luck trying to get a seat at the bar which you have to be at in order to get the happy hour prices. The tacos were good and reasonably priced but the drinks were way over priced even on happy hour. It's an older crowd with mostly Cougars on the prowl. Shame because I really wanted to love this place but we won't be back."}
{"text":"I originally had a jaded view since our 9:00 reservation didn't get seated until 10:15. However the staff did make up for it with free champagne and appetizers.   They truly went above and beyond to make up for the slight issue with timing. I would come back here. The food was great and service was good- very friendly."}
{"text":"I really do like the creative sushi and the whole modern fusion thing that SumoMaya has going on. I also love to sit at the wrap-around kitchen bar and watch the chefs and cooks hustle and work their culinary magic, but at the same time I have to admit that I avidly avoid this place on weekend nights when it basically turns into a techno club with really great food. Not that there's anything wrong with that, and if that's your kind of scene..."}
{"text":"Well, not many people give 5 stars but I am!  What a unique spin this place has.  I am a sushi lover and this place has some unique awesome sushi!!  My son and I went here for lunch today and I cannot wait to go back !!  Wonderful place and so different!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business meeting and was so pleasantly surprised. The menu is super unique and not being the biggest sushi fan I was lost. Our waitress Kirsten took time to explain everything and recommend the perfect combination of plates for our eclectic tastes... So so wonderful. Can't wait to go back!! And the cocktails were delish !"}
{"text":"SumoMaya has hands down the best brunch in Scottsdale. Bottomless drinks - not just mimosas, bottomless appetizers, sides and desserts with your choice of a meal. You must try the chicken enchilada... so good! The atmosphere is amazing but be sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Food was amazing BUT portions were tiny, service was so bad, they got our order wrong 3 times. Food came out at random times and were told different parts of the kitchen made the other dishes so they could not come out at the same time? As we walked in water was streaming out of the front door and was being pushed out by brooms. Music was so loud i could not hear the person next to me. Really bizarre experience. The chef knows how to cook but i wont be back."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from the plain guacamole here. I've been sick for three days. Not cool."}
{"text":"I want to like this restaurant, I really do. The food is actually really good and the magic mojito is Devine. Normally I don't let poor service trump my appreciation for the food. However, all three of my experiences at this restaurant have been ruined by the lack of customer service and disorganization of staff. My first experience at this restaurant was pleasant. However, My friends and I would have enjoyed our meal mote if our food had arrived at the same time.  Round two: reservation was lost   Round three: snooty brunette lady bartender made my friend feel very uncomfortable when she apologetically asked to have her drink made to accommodate her severe food allergy by stating \"I literally don't care, that's how the drinks made.\" Our reservation was at 7, was sat at 740 (due to the dust storm, not sure how that effects things). Lastly, and once again, everyone's food was brought out at a different time. I'm done."}
{"text":"As another reviewer remarked, Sumo Maya is definitely hit-or-miss. I'll start with the misses: the music is so loud! However, I think this is part of the \"hip\" factor (although I can't be sure because I'm not hip). Also, some of the tables have plastic chairs which are both uncomfortable and look tacky too. Food-wise, I was not a huge fan of the asparagus because it was swimming in what tasted like eel sauce.Lastly, my steak was VERY expensive and not as good as it's price would have one expect. Now onto the good-I started with the seabass ceviche and it was dynamite! I love ceviche and it was one of the best I've had in a long while. We also ordered the lump crab guacamole which was also very good. What really earned the fourth star for me, though, was the service-our server Jessica M. was fabulous! The place was packed yet she still stopped by to check on us frequently. Also, my dad can be a very needy customer, but Jessica handled all of his eccentric requests with warmth and a smile. The bar manager even accommodated us far more than I would have expected him too. Everyone who works there obviously cares a great deal about the business and it shows!"}
{"text":"Not a place I would go again.  it took almost 40 minutes for the server to bring a dried-out piece of lime for my water.  the food was meh, nothing special, unless you order the kimchi fried rice, which my friend did.  If I ever wondered what zombie guts from The Walking Dead must taste like, then it's probably this dish.  the \"aroma\" made me want to puke.  Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"Stopped by for their amazing brunch...actually probably top 3 brunch in Scottsdale!! More of a high energy very chill vibe scene more than your high etiquette brunch...please come hungry...all you can eat appetizers over 2 hours!! It's a lot of food!! Your entree can be thought of to go...all you can drink mimosas for extra 10 bucks...always excellent!!! You only choose one main course...if you like kimchee fried rice, theirs is one of the best!!! Their pad Thai is a touch sourish, not bad but not great. Overall fantastic!!"}
{"text":"First time at Sumomaya and LOVED it!  Great combination of flavors, textures, and cultures.  Made my taste buds wake up and say HEY!  I'll definitely be back.  Thx to Nicole and Sumomaya."}
{"text":"Sushi AND tacos!! The edamame is the BEST I have ever had! Great menu. Great wines (even from Napa) variety of things to eat. Good happy hour."}
{"text":"WAY TOO LOUD! The only reason for 3/5 stars. The food here was amazing! 5 STARS The tuna tacos are the best thing going. Craving them already. Great cocktail menu. Innovative food! Lovely patio. However, all of this was ruined by the noise level! Music so loud my table of three could not have a conversation and the server was screaming to communicate with us. As a result other patrons we forced to scream bringing the noise level up even higher. Would love to go again but I don't think I can handle the noise."}
{"text":"We came for lunch at around 10:30am and there was no one there so we got seated right away. There's a parking lot in the back of the restaurant and we didn't have trouble finding parking but during the busier times, it might get a little difficult.  I think everything I've eaten here has been followed with an \"interesting...\" because the combinations of ingredients in their dishes are things I wouldn't have thought of but they make it work. They have an open kitchen, bar seating for the kitchen, bar seating for the sushi, and a bar in the middle of the restaurant for drinks.   POMEGRANATE GUACAMOLE ($14) - This is probably the best chips and guacamole I've ever had. I've never had pomegranate in my guac before and I never knew how much I loved the combo. In addition, the \"chips\" are big crispy tortillas sprinkled with tajin which makes it unbelievable tasty. Typically, I always have chips leftover because I use a lot of guac for tasteless chips, but we actually had to ask for more chips because they were so tasty on its own. Really recommend. 5/5  APPLE-SALMON ROLL ($13) - This is the first time I've ever had apple in my sushi (I'm sensing a trend here). The apple actually added a sweetness to the roll as well as a little bit of crunch. 4/5  AL PASTOR PAD THAI ($14) - This restaurant just has so many dishes I'm not used to and this is another. We saw this and had to order it. They asked for our desired spice level and we asked for mild. It was not spicy at all and we had to ask for sriracha to kick it up a notch. I thought there was too many bean sprouts that took away from the noodles and meat. 3/5  KOREAN BEEF TACO ($9 for 2) - I thought this was okay. It's a little overpriced for your typical taco and I didn't think the flavor of the beef had any Korean in it. 2.5/5  TRES LECHES CAKE ($10) - Very sweet and just the way I like it. The only thing is I wish the cake itself was soaked in the milk more so it soaks up all that flavor, but it was not so we had to soak it ourselves. 4/5  One thing I've noticed is they like to put sriracha in a lot of their dishes. They even have sriracha in their Golden Triangle drink, which tasted pretty good. The decor is really cool and the service is great too. This is a really cool place to eat; I would definitely recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"We had dinner with a 4 year old in tow. The place is large and very kid friendly for a high end dining experience. They had a kids menu. We got him the fried rice which was yummy. We also tried the green curry fried rice, tom kha soup and the wagyu shaken beef. Of all of them the wagyu was the weakest only because it was tough. Flavors were great. The hot sake was yummy too. Tons of options for various palates."}
{"text":"Just a heads up! For brunch the Green Tea waffle & duck is a VERY small portion. Like literally half a waffle & a baby duck wing. Like wtf?? )13-15$? For that meal. Don't get me wrong it was delicious but did not fill me up whatsoever! Like I could of ate another meal after that. && I'm a tiny person, 26 at 5'2 and 106 lbs. I was still starving after that. Ok. Rant over. Lol"}
{"text":"Very cool venue, excellent service, and amazing food. Exceeded our expectations in every way!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and atmosphere. They have great GF options too  The mango roll is one of the best rolls I've ever had. The chairs are cool looking but not built for comfort. Their craft cocktails are great. Nice spin on Mexican/Asian fusion."}
{"text":"We are visiting Scottsdale for a week and have put quite a bit of time into researching restaurants. SumoMaya has been recommended to us several times. Today we went for a later lunch. The restaurant was busy, but far from full. The receptionist told us that it would be a 45 minute wait.......or that we could sit in the bar. The bar had plenty of empty tables, so we took a seat.  We sat for 20 minutes while servers passed us by without bringing us water, menus, or even acknowledging our presence. We watched while servers stood around and chatted.........we even watched one server take a shot of tequila ( the bar had made an extra one for the table next to us......we watched as he downed it ) We finally left......."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. When we walked in we did not know what to expect, we happened to come in at the start of happy hour which is great. Service was fairly limited with not many suggestions or welcoming greetings from our server a little disappointing to begging with. When the food showed, we were pretty impressed by the textures and flavors and it was a game changer. It keeps you wanting to try different dishes and that's why we are planing to come back, but we will probably ask for a different server. Cocktails and background music are also fantastic!"}
{"text":"Finally found good ramen in Arizona! I have been meaning to try this place for months and yesterday a coworker mentioned it for lunch, what a great idea! We had the pomegranate guacamole to start. While the guacamole was good in itself, the pomegranate part wasn't worth it. In addition to the Pom seeds there were dried apricots on top which just wasn't great. If you're looking for better fruity guacamole, stick with barrio queen. I was torn between the pork belly pad Thai and the ramen, and the server recommended the ramen. I was not disappointed! The egg was heavenly, just the right amount of soft, the pork was flavorful and there was a perfect relationship of noodles to broth. So happy to have found this place! I'll definitely be back for happy hour ASAP, so I can try everything!!"}
{"text":"Went to SumoMaya over a weekend during their Social Hour. Had a ton of great food, drinks and great service despite my friend knocking her glass off the table which consequently shattered right near some other patrons. I would definitely come back to SumoMaya. Plus, they have a tree in their dining room. How cool is that?"}
{"text":"Definitely not coming here again. So disappointed. We heard from a friend that this place was amazing. We ordered our food late because the waiter took his time. He also forgot our ceviche. The food came out and was pretty good but definitely not worth the price. It was also super loud in there. Very uncomfortable seats as well. Came for my birthday but not coming back."}
{"text":"TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE! I rec'd a $150.00 Gift Card that was purchased in Scottsdale as a Christmas present for me December, 2016 to use at the new SumoMaya in Houston that still has not opened as of 7/1/2018 and no opening date available! I called the manager in Scottsdale, MIKE BART and he told me to re-gift it! or come to Scottsdale, I live in Houston. Really Mike? What are you doing in a customer service management position? MAJOR FAIL!"}
{"text":"Went to this place on a Saturday night and it was slammed! I was all alone at the bar and there was standing room only in the entire place. You would think that I would not get much attention from any of the bartenders but that was so wrong. Christina took great care of me despite how packed it was. Always grabbing me another drink at the right time and keeping a great conversation going the entire time. Food was amazing and service was perfect thanks to Christina!"}
{"text":"Fun place! Forgot to take photos but to be honest, I'm not sure they would come out - it's really dark inside. I had to use my flashlight on my phone in order to read the menu. The tables are small which made putting all the tapas on the table difficult to navigate for serving. That part I didn't care for too much. We sampled a few of the different drinks off the drink menu and they were very interesting and tasty. It's very loud inside so not an ideal place for a meeting of any sorts. This seems more like a social place, to celebrate and have a good time or for a birthday celebration. The food was decent it - the ginger rice was my favorite. The pad Thai was a little bland but more plentiful for sharing than the ginger rice dish. Their valet parking is complimentary. Inside it's really cool with a giant tree in the middle of the restaurant. Again, a good vibe for socializing and having fun."}
{"text":"This restaurant had the worst service I have ever experienced. From the moment we walked in, the hostess was rude and nearly denied us a party of 7 on a Tuesday evening when the restaurant was empty except a few tables. We waited 20 minutes to be seated while watching 5 workers sitting around chatting with each other and doing absolutely nothing. Waitress was very slow and not welcoming. 10% effort was put into making sure we had what we needed. My water wasn't even refilled the entire time. I'll admit the food was great. Everything was super spicy but I enjoyed the spice. The prices would be worth it if the service was better but I do not see myself going back due to how poorly we were treated."}
{"text":"Drove past this way to many times finally came in with my brother.The restaurant is beautiful. Right away the ambience blows you away. The food was good and fresh but a little to saucy for me. But the service is what makes me want to come back. Nina was friendly right off the bat. She was knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Ask for her"}
{"text":"Food is always excellent!!!  Tried the Saturday brunch and loved the menu!  One of my favorite restaurants.  Love the ambiance!!! Pad Thai, is excellent, pomegranate guac is yummy!  Date choc cake is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Trendy Trendy Trendy. This place is Amazing!  I went here for my birthday on LOVED IT! The food was great, all of the combinations were thing is had never even had thought of. It was fantastic. I got the Pad Thai Al Pastor, and it may have been the greatest thing I have ever eaten. Not ever, but at least most unique. ok. I just loved it!  Definitely will be going back and will bring a big group."}
{"text":"This place is just... too much. Asian-Mexican cuisine? Like why? I don't understand. It's like someone wanted to own a restaurant but couldn't decide on which kind so they just decided to blend them. Why are ceviche, tacos and sushi on one menu? Hmm. And speaking of ceviche, I had that the last time I went and literally had to cut up all of the shrimp (which was not deveined, gross) because it was literally just whole shrimp stuck in a bowl... And why they served it with a miniature side of stale popcorn I'll never know. Lol I just can't.  The decor and vibe is unique, but that's about all. Go here if you want an experience, not necessarily if you want to be satisfied."}
{"text":"Half hits, half misses. (And we tried a LOT of stuff.)  Hits:  -Soft shell crab roll. Beautiful presentation, wonderful flavor. The aioli was really nice, and the crab was fried to perfection.  -Bacon wrapped medjool dates. YES. MORE OF THESE. ALWAYS. -Wild mushroom tacos. So good you won't miss meat. I echo the concerns of others that they are too small for the price...but I'm willing to pay whatever you demand for more. -Miso eggplant. Delicate and creamy. Will make a believer even out of the most ardent eggplant hater. Perfect. -Green magic mojito. This blended drink danced on my taste buds, but if you don't like your drinks herbaceous, go for something else.  Neither here nor there:  -Guacamole with dried fruit. Decent guac but too much lime, needed more salt and a bit of heat, tomato, or onion flavor. At 11 bucks, it should really come with a couple extra chips instead of making you shell out for more. -Rollo Chingon. Too much guac on top, but the adobo shrimp sushi was tasty and the roll was stunning to look at. Just take some of that extra avocado topping and smear it on your lotus root chip.  -Coconut cocktail. Serviceable, but needed something to put it over the top. Couldn't really taste the lemongrass or lime.  -Valet. You gotta. Ain't no way around it.  Misses:  -Crispy pork belly roll. So aggressively salty. Could taste hardly anything it was so salty. Should have listened to some of the other reviewers on here and avoided it.  -Korean beef taco. Salt lick central. So salty you couldn't taste anything else. Really a bummer. Also not traditional Korean beef like you'd get a Korean BBQ, but shredded. -Head on giant shrimp. Shrimp is singular in this case. And dramatically overcooked. Inconsistent seasoning, with one bite rubbery shrimp and the next almost pure salt rub. The pureed garlic and halved cherry tomatoes were pretty insipid too. Don't waste your 14 bucks on one nasty shrimp.   -Nightclub atmosphere. So necessarily loud."}
{"text":"The best miso sea bass we ever tasted. Terrific service. Everything was delicious.  Bacon wrapped dates. Edamame. Guacamole with squash. Miso sea bass. Tres leches cake with Merangue."}
{"text":"This place gets 3 stars because of the vibe. They had a DJ spinning and the place has a giant tree in the middle of it like you are outside. It is usually packed and everyone here is hip and lively. Now the food is just OK, there are some items that are good (ginger fried rice, and a few of the rolls), but the price is pretty hard to swallow. Also the service could definitely be improved, it took us forever to get the attention of one of the bartenders to serve us (but it was busy). I might give it another try but definitely during their happy hour so it's cheaper."}
{"text":"The three stars are for the atmosphere. The food portions are very tiny but they claim they are intended to be shared. Drinks took an awful long time to arrive.  The server was plesant. Mostly a younger crowd (30's - 40's)"}
{"text":"Wow! This is an experience for sure. The menu is out of this world. So many unique selections. The presentation is beautiful. It's a swanky, upscale event. My only complaint is the music is cranked up too loud so you can't really carry a comfortable conversation."}
{"text":"Awesome sauce!   Heard about this place numbers of times, happy I took the time to make it by.  The scenery of this restaurant is very cool!  Open, beautiful colors, simple designs.  We sat at the bar, seats were very comfortable (cushioned) and they have big screen projection tv's.   The vibe here is very laid-back yet spunky and vibrant! I can see coming here for a Saturday/Sunday brunch with family and friends.  Also for any big game whether it's football or basketball-I can see this place filling up quick with sport fanatics. It has different dynamics to complement different personalities and with that being said this place is definitely an original restaurant that is one of it's kind."}
{"text":"`This restaurant is located at the Scottsdale Plaza Resort with a beautiful outside patio and large bar/lounge area. The staff was very friendly and happy to take it. As they say with hospitality as warm as the sun."}
{"text":"We met friends for dinner here tonight and the whole experience was amazing. Our waiter was awesome, very knowledgeable about the menu and his suggestions for items on the menu were spot on. Every item we ordered was so good. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"This is a place you go to if you're looking for a fun/cool environment. The decor is great with pops of color, quirky chairs. and wide open floor plan with a big patio area. There's a sushi bar area that views into the kitchen.   The drinks are delicious and the ambiance is very.... hip.   The food here is good, it's a mexican/japanese fusion. So not exactly MY favorite type of cuisine but it was good even considering the fact that I don't like fusion foods. The pricing does change dramatically depending on if you're there for HH or if you're there during regular hours. No biggie at all, this just means they have really good HH specials."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour! The tacos are amazing. Developed flavors and cool garnishes...the edible flowers were a fun touch. The ambience is very relaxed, but upscale. The service was pretty good; I usually like a little more interaction with the bartender though...however they were very busy. Will most definitely be back here, with friends in tow."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!!! Every time I come here I fall more in love with this place !!! The food is absolutely in point!!! They are very clean!!!! And they have a great happy hour and great music to put you in a great mood!!!!! Definitely check this place out!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really on point. We were in for brunch on Sunday and had a great time. The price fix menu items are all unique and well prepared, not huge, but there are unlimited small plates like black bean hummus with plantains and sushi roll trio. I ordered the enchiladas which were prepared with minimum cheese, spicy chicken and fresh garnish. The pad Thai was requested spicy by my hubby and was perfection. The dessert is included as well delicious cinnamon crisps with fresh berries and creme fresh. Our waitress Maren made things fun for us by suggesting the perfect spread. Hats off to her! We will definitely request her next time we are there. The only bummer was that the entrees came out at various times so half the table was done when the rest got their food. Other than that hiccup, we love the place!"}
{"text":"Super interesting menu.  We shared about 6 different items. The Guacamole/ Korean beef and the Kobe beef were outstanding.  Tacos excellent.  Spicy crab noodles really spicy.  Pad Thai pretty good.  Sushi was average at best.  Portions are small.  This is a generous review.  Drink prices way overpriced and menu items are really expensive for what you get.  I give the food a 4 but the portions and value a 2.5."}
{"text":"I ate here just over two years ago, and loved it.  Since I was back in town, thought I would go again!  And it was still amazing!  Make sure you make a reservation, still a very popular place in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I always love this place. I think it changed since first opening because the various dishes are not as big. Overall- delightful because the staff is friendly and great people watching. We greatly enjoyed the various tacos.... Specially the short rib. We also love the calamari. Lots of flavor in every dish."}
{"text":"Bartender: Presley Imbibes: house hot sake (unexpectedly and unannouncedly expensive at $17 for a carafe)  Eats: Thai coconut soup, Peruvian corn, crispy chicken mole  Brilliantly conceived mash-up Central/South American and Asian restaurant with a gorgeous interior.   Service was attentive. There was a small snafu regarding a taste of an IPA that took an exceptional amount of time to arrive, particularly given the fact that I was sitting at the bar. But I was in no hurry, and the service was cheery and chatty. Excellent work, Presley.  The food was quite good. The Thai coconut soup was a standout. I love anything lemongrass and coconut, lime and coconut, lemon and coconut, a little bit of heat. You get the idea. This was hotter than most, but was really quite divine. The Peruvian corn was surprising and although simple was fun to munch through. The crispy chicken mole was just right, enough heat and chocolate without being overbearing.  $17 for a wee carafe of hot house sake is just a little bit crazy singing to me. I didn't see mention of house sake anywhere, so I asked. One would think that at that price point for the price would have been fertilized somehow. It was the only downside to what was otherwise an interesting, fun, engaging experience.  I'd come back here. And I'd hold the sake."}
{"text":"Ate the Mexican Pho and it was delicious. It tastes like this has been slow cooking for many hours. I also really liked the plating. Service was good. The Passionfruit sangria is pretty strong. Just one is enough. :)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. It is one of my favorite brunch spots. The food is good and the mimosas are better. Be sure to ask for josh as your waiter, he's guaranteed to make your experience even better!"}
{"text":"Took someone here for a work dinner and I was blown away! Wow. What a unique, AMAZING experience. It's one of those places where you just ask your server to order whatever is good and no matter what they bring, you'll be satisfied. My contractor got an the sea bass dish which was out of this world delicious! My manager got 2 sushi rolls which were AWESOME. I don't remember which ones but whatever they were I rated them a 10. I got the lobster pad Thai??? I think? It was GREAT. Then we also got fried rice which was delicious. To split, we all got one of the traditional ceviche's .... SO GOOD. What I love is that every dish has such a beautiful presentation.   This is a must try in Scottsdale.... Just have a good amount of money on you. Trust me, it's worth it!   To all the people who wrote bad reviews about this place: you're probably all cheap people who don't enjoy food. Or maybe you all are just a flat out JOKE. (:"}
{"text":"Love the happy hour! One of the best meals I've ever had for five dollars. I had three very different tacos! I love the mushroom taco!! Soo good"}
{"text":"The only reason for two stars it's because of the service.. The rolls are amazing, but the service, oh boy! The restaurant is empty, its 4:50 and i orderd at 3:45 , im waiting an hour for three sushi rolls.disgracfule service"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. I was with a group of seven and I was able to try a myriad of dishes. Having been to several fusion restaurants some of the flavors overlap and the intent is lost due to the fact that I get the impression that the chef's are jacks of all trades and masters of none. This was definitely not the case here. The food was outstanding. Fantastic tacos and our group shared several of the rice dishes. We started with the edamame and the rocky shrimp. Usually rocky shrimp is not very good but having had it once where it was outstanding I try it every time I eat a place for the first time that features it on the menu. It was really good. I have to say the thing that was most impressive was the Oaxaca Old Fashioned.  The bartender who made this drink achieved perfection. Literally this was one of the best cocktails I have ever had. The only draw back was that our service was pretty horrendous. Maybe because I was seated on the patio with my group. I noticed the servers inside seemed much more attentive. We waited quite awhile to order the drinks and appetizers. Then there was quite a bit of time where our glasses were empty and we waited to order our meal. Maybe my frustration was expounded due to the fact I really wanted more of the aforementioned cocktail. I had to check myself that I wasn't being impatient by asking my wife if she noticed the lengthy gaps in server visits. It was confirmed by a general consensus of the majority of the table. We did order desert and were forced to admire it while we waited a good five minutes to get utensils to eat it with as they had promptly bused our table we were left with only our hands. They definitely were pretty. I would more than likely recommend this place as the food was pretty damn good. Maybe our server was having a bad night, however shorting me cocktails is usually a recipe for a bad review."}
{"text":"First timer-- AMAZING!!  I decided to take my fiance here for his birthday dinner because we love trying new places & I've been to Central Bistro before off Camelback & loved that restaurant (same owners).  Our server was super friendly & willing to make recommendations-which I like. Service was fast also.  I ordered the Passionfruit Sangria which was great!  It is a tapas style restaurant for sure, so we ordered a bunch of food & tried a little of everything.  My FAVORITE pick off of the menu is the Pork Belly Roll- oh my goodness! This has a great savory taste, a little crunch, & its a perfect combo with the coleslaw they top it woth. Definitely recommend!!  The downside is you will either be waiting a long time or you need to make reservations.. I made mine a week out & they only had 2 time slots left for a Saturday..   Definitely will be back though!!"}
{"text":"Very interesting/eclectic restaurant.  Food is very good.  Pretty trendy but not pretentious."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and cool atmosphere. Had the wild mushroom tacos, and those mighty things packed a great, fused punch. The homemade chips added a nice punch to the guacamole."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food is fantastic the service is top notch the ambience is luxurious. We ordered the Wagyu beef Nigiri sushi and it was phenomenal. We also ate a lot of the different specialty sushi rolls and they were really good too. The tuna tartar was served on ice in a real coconut and it was super delicious."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the most spectacular restaurant experience I've had in a long time.  Maren, our waitress, was next level fantastic: with her beautiful hair, flower crown, and unicorn necklace, we knew we had hit the jackpot. She was on top of her game and we noticed that on top of her smaller tables, she was managing an ENORMOUS group and we always had water filled, drink orders taken, and plates of food in front of us. She was kind, friendly, gracious, funny, and above and beyond wonderful. We had had a rough weekend and she really redeemed it. Honestly, the food was spectacular, but I would have come back for Maren because she was amazing. Manager/owner: give her a raise!   We had no expectations heading to this \"bottomless brunch\". Step one: unlimited \"side plates\". Yes. Unlimited. See my pictures, but this was the BEST guacamole I've ever had in my LIFE. There were a myriad of other small plates. We tried Chef's choice Sushi: amazing; huevos revueltos--delicious; black bean hummus--get it; tres leches oatmeal-- Oh. My. Gosh, and our entrees-- Pad Thai, machaca 2 way eggs, and vegetarian scramble. Topped off with bu√±uelos which were covered in caramel goodness and pecans. Really everyone, there is a reason this restaurant has the reviews it does. This was the BEST brunch I've had in I can't remember when.   I want to write this with as much enthusiasm as possible because I feel honored to have had this restaurant experience and I want others to have it as well. GO. NOW."}
{"text":"I've eaten at SumoMaya before and loved the ambience and food. Not only do they do a stellar job at Japanese- Mexican fusion, but they also achieve an eclectic Alice-in-Wonderland type of feel, with a tree in the middle of the restaurant and hot pink chairs and portraits of Japanese and Mexican ancestors sprinkled everywhere. Aside from this, they also have a killer brunch. I had heard through friends that the brunch at SumoMaya was amazing, but they absolutely defied my expectations.  First of all they take the concept of bottomless brunch from drinks and apply it to food. But what results is not some boring breakfast buffet-like meal - it's better. The structure of the meal is three courses, with unlimited ordering for the first course and the third course. What exactly does this mean? All you can eat dessert, and all you can eat apps! Oh, and all you can eat sides, too if your stomach can handle it.  For apps they have everything from sushi rolls to pomegranate guac to chorizo scramble. If you don't already fill up on these, because they are divine, then you can move on to your entr√©e. The entr√©e list is overwhelming. It took us about ten minutes to order because we just could not decide. There is everything from sweet potato waffles to a Cubano sandwich to coconut pancakes with spicy mangos. We finally ordered the salmon omelette and the wagyu steak with the poached egg. Oh my gosh the salmon melted in my mouth! My only critique was the steak was a little over-seasoned but we ate everything anyway. And holy cow, how we had room for dessert I'll never know but the cheesecake is like biting into light, creamy deliciousness. (It's still healthy because it comes with fruit right? Because we definitely capitalized on the unlimited on this one...) Overall, this is the best deal ever, it's only $29 for the meal itself and an extra $10 if you want the unlimited drinks. I'm so excited to go back and try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great ingredient, powerful flavor profiles, beautiful ambience; in many ways this is a stand-out restaurant. The downsides are noise level, especially if crowded, spotty service-never offered a refill of our water, and poor expediting. Food presentation was good, but not well thought out; ceviche served with a spoon too small for the bowl and guacamole served with a giant spoon. We will return but will aim for off times."}
{"text":"I ususally dont like suprises, but this resturant was quite a treat. My father took me and my family there for my 19th birthday and it was delicious. I was kind of not sure about an asian/mexican mix of food but this place proved me wrong. My family ordered the guacamole with bacon chunks (mind you there were many guacamole options) and the guacamole came with handmade corn tortillas that included a taste of chile lime on the top. Combined it was magnificent, I love guacamole and bacon but that tang of lime was the cherry on top. After the appetizer I ordered the Rollo Chingon, it had adobo grilled shrimp, guacamole, cilantro, jalape√±o, red lotus root chips and balsamic strawberry glaze. I chose this roll becasue im very adventurous when it comes to flavors. The shrimp was grilled to perfection, the guacamole and the cilantro gave the roll a sweet taste and the red lotus chips evened it out with some saltiness but when you get some strawberry glaze on the roll (and I mean get becasue its drizzled on the plate) mixed with the soy sauce was a great mixture of sweet and salty. Then I ordered a Strawberry Gazpacho that had chilled, lump crab, marcona almonds and evoo. I have never had gazpacho but I enjoyed it, the soup was very sweet when you first slurp some but then a little spiciness hits you, im a little sensitive to spiciness but the flavors were well put together. Since it was my birthday our waiter brought out a of slice peanut butter and chocolate cream pie, now I hate peanut butter but I still ate it out of respect. I surprisingly couldn't taste the peanut butter that well, so if you love peanut butter just know you can taste it with the first bite, but the chocolate overpowers it as soon as you start to chew. All the food here was really well displayed and very good, I will definitely go back. I'd like to also comment on the actual place itself. There was live music by a cute folksy cover band, just a man and a woman im not sure if they're there all the time but they were fun. The whole place was well decorated with bright colors and picturs and asian/hispanic elderly on the back of some of the chairs was a funny touch. The atmosphere was quite casual and the staff was very nice and very attractive, that's always a bonus! So overall I give the restaurant 5 stars because of its overall excellence in taste, display, service, outlook, and originality."}
{"text":"Bomb!!!  Everything about this place was fantastic other than the service. The food and atmosphere makes he mediocre service well worth it."}
{"text":"Really unhappy with all of the food I had ordered. The manager didn't take the undercooked tacos off my bill and told me they were always prepared that way. Cute decor, but it doesn't make up for the bad food."}
{"text":"I have been to Sumo multiple times for happy hour and dinner. Happy hour is only at high tops or bars only. I love the upbeat atmosphere and the unique decor. The service is good but not excellent. There were times where I had to wait about 15-20 minutes or so before getting any water or menus. The food comes out individually whenever it's done so that is a plus! I absolutely love their charred edamame, sea bass ceviche (I don't think it's on their menu anymore but they should really bring it back!) and sumo-rita. The sumorita is served frozen but you can request for it to be on the rocks. Also, if you are a guacamole lover, try their guacamole! They have two or three different ones and they are all delicious!  As for parking, if you come early enough, you can park right outside in one of the unmarked spots. But if you come during dinner time when they are the busiest, you would have to find your own parking elsewhere or use their complimentary valet parking. I've been here before when the valet was full and it was very inconvenient."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Love the vibe and the energy as well"}
{"text":"Very Hip!! 1st time here from CO & it was amazing & our server; Zach made our 26th Anniversary so fun!!!"}
{"text":"Was dying to go and when i finally did i wasn't all that impressed. The restaurant itself is really hip and the food is decent but I feel like its more of a place \"to be seen\" more then anything. I've been several times and i must say they have a good happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Awesome twist on Asian and Mexican food, wonderful decor, beautiful plates and delicious hot tea. Bravo!!:))))))))))"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place and it didn't live up to it. We tried 2 rolls, the crab one and a Suzuki.. The crab one was like a soft shell crab roll, delicious but not anything special. Suzuki roll was an overpriced spicy tuna roll with some mayo sauce. We also tried the Mexican style pho which was pretty horrible.. So salty and way too much lime. Didn't even taste like a tortilla soup.. Barley edible. The best thing we had and the only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the Mexican street corn side was amazing! Great atmosphere so I will maybe go back to drink and try happy hour. I think every restaurant deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"If a Hostess tells you all tables were reserved and absolutely no tables left, this place must be beyond amazing, right?   We dined during the Friday happy hour mad rush between 5-6PM. They did find a table for us.  However, we just needed to be out by 7PM for the next reserved party.  We ended sitting in the back patio area. It was HOT HOT, and not just for the beautiful interior design. The shade and water mist didn't help much with the high humidity that day. Our Waitress was superb! She quickly ordered and got our food.   We ordered a few items off their social hour menu and dinner menu.  I guess the Asian side in me that I'm always skeptical when it comes to Asian Fusion. I was sold and impressed on the quality of their dishes. We tried a few of the street tacos - Wild Mushroom, Korean beef and Pork \"Al Pastor\". They were grilled, so juicy, and incredibly flavorful. The traditional guac was just ok for me.  I do like the tortilla chips that came with it. It didn't taste like the typical restaurant chips. It tasted homemade sea salt tortilla chips.   Another dish I highly recommend off of the dinner menu is the Chinese Style Chile-Crab Garlic Noodles. It's not Crustacean Garlic Noodles, but will still satisfy your garlic noodles craving with just little spicy kick in it.  I will have to return and try it with their many cocktails too.   It's a trendy and loud place. A great place for girls night out, date night, or bring out of town guest. It is complimentary parking valet. You might be able find an available parking space by the bank if you dine after 5PM. Parking spaces are limited. The parking lot is shared with other businesses in the same area. Park at your own risk!"}
{"text":"SumoMaya is very nicely decorated and trendy.  Acrylic chairs for the tables, sushi bar seating if you want, and then your standard bar seating.  The patio doors were opened for our dinner last week but surprisingly the restaurant wasn't hot at all (I can't image the AC bill).    The menu was very interesting and it was hard to make a choice. My opinion of what I ordered - the Pastor Street Tacos (2 for $6):  The quality was great but they seemed smaller than street tacos which made me question the price.  Seemed very over priced to me, but yummy none the less - the Green Tea Cocktail ($9): refreshing but wasn't really strong either - the Pork Belly Ramen ($16):  This was fantastic.  Large portion, tons of pork belly, and just very well made.  I would absolutely order this again if I happen to come here again.  My friends ordered: - Shishito Peppers: pepper roulette she called them.  Some where hot and some weren't.  I don't typically order these but that is the norm for this type of dish, so I learned something new.  I tried one and it was very tasty. - Seasonal Mushrooms: Very yummy - Tuna Tacos:  FYI the taco is deep fried and not soft like typical street tacos.  Also very small like mine. - Bacon wrapped dates: there were about 6, maybe 8 dates in the dish.  My friend liked them. - Sangria:  Not very strong but yummy.  I would go back to sumo maya for a special occasion, the ambiance warrants it, but I don't think I would go back for just regular dinners out.  Just too pricey for me."}
{"text":"Make sure you call 5 days ahead for a reservation they seem to never have space. I called at 9 AM and they are booked for the whole day they open at 9 I don't understand how u get booked before you open. I'll go spend my money somewhere else thank you"}
{"text":"If you want to sit for 20 min while the entire wait staff walks past your table this is the place for you! Wait staff hung out by the coke munching on snacks, but somehow couldn't find the time to at least give us a glass of water or a brew. Menu looked good, if you ever get served."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I had my birthday brunch here Sunday and everything was absolutely perfect. The food was phenomenal and our service was exceptional. Zach was friendly, attentive and fun. Thanks so much for an amazing experience!!!"}
{"text":"Oh man this place is awesome! I have a seafood allergy, so whenever ceviche is available without shrimp I'm all over it, this place has that and was an amazing experience :-) venue is great for date night or with friends, hang at the bar while your table is getting ready."}
{"text":"This is the most unique restaurant.  Every dish has an amazing combination of flavors which are unexpected but wonderful.  We had the sizzling chaufa rice, asada guacamole, and 2 great  cut rolls.  Wish I could have tried everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Hmmm, sumo maya, very strange name for a restaurant. It's a hybrid between Japanese and Mexican food.  I know Japanese and Merican food goes well and there are lots of mix use in both cuisine but in this restaurant, it really didn't go well. The food was expensive and the portions were small. Only thing I liked about this restaurant the designs and the big tree right in the middle of the restaurant, I believe it is a real tree. I think it's more of a bar atmosphere rather than going they for food. Give it try, at least you'll like the tree."}
{"text":"Great spot! They have awesome drinks and their food is super flavorful. The atmosphere is very unique and upbeat. Would recommend this place for lunch or even a night out with the girls! The food is on the pricer side but other than that it's awesome."}
{"text":"Very cool, hip place.  Great food and combination of Mexican food and Sushi.  The menu is setup great, I would highly recommend family style ordering so you can try everything.  The guacamole and tinga chicken tacos were amazing.  Only complaint is we had a reservation and it took 20 minutes for us to sit down and the front check in employees seemed clueless to what was going on."}
{"text":"Unique flavors that were actually too different and odd...  I usually love innovative pairings and trying new things, but I wasn't too impressed by their flavors here. One odd dish was their street corn, which tasted like a mayo mash with corn and popcorn. It was a weird texture and had a bland taste which was not appealing at all. We also got the apple salmon roll which was also not as flavorful as I had hoped, and the flavors of sweet chili sauce and apple did not go well together. We also tried the mahi mahi fish tacos and the al pastor tacos. The fish tacos were good, but the al pastor tacos were also bland and I wouldn't order them again. The tacos were also 2 for $8 but are so small and can be finished in two bites. I wouldn't come here again unless it was happy hour where the tacos are discounted. Their kimchee fried rice also just tasted like white rice, but I did enjoy the sizzling chaufa rice which came in a huge bowl with enough to share. Overall a beautiful restaurant with a wide selection, but I'd like to see improvements in their flavors."}
{"text":"This is a tough one. I wanted to like this place. The decor is drool worthy and honestly, no other restaurant in Arizona even comes close on that front. The good ended there, not once but twice, for us.   - We asked for the sushi menu and were told only brunch menu will be served until 3 PM. It was only 11:30 AM. Disappointed but we went ahead and ordered. While we were eating we notice multiple tables around ours eat sushi! Their website still says they serve lunch from 11 to 3PM. The least the server should have done was mentioned there was some confusion. IF that was the case.  - Hubby didn't enjoy his dish much. The manager, not the server, casually asked how the food was and he told him it wasn't good. The manager nodded and left. That's it. It was day one of brunch for them. Feedback would have been crucial.   - dessert served. The lava cake was pretty good. It came with a shot of cocoa which was supposed to be served warm according to the servers description. It was cold and clearly didn't go well with the cake. Told this to the server who walked away as we were talking to him when another server called out to him. He came back but no apology! Forget good service, the service here lacked basic manners and etiquette. Insulting to say the least.   We loved the modern eclectic vibe and my crab meat with poached egg was wonderful, but, sadly we are never going to return."}
{"text":"Good quality food. Little pricey. Excellent mini tacos! Very fresh. No toilet paper in the bathrooms...Very loud inside. Decent vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Came here last Monday for a Anniversary dinner ,was greeted by Eli the manager very kind and excellent customer service ! I pretty much ordered everything on menu ! Everything was amazing and the place has a real cool vibe !!"}
{"text":"I waited a while before I decided to write this review....On my last and final visit to this restaurant, my husband and I decided on a Sunday evening to have drinks and a bite to eat there.  We sat at the bar and there were 2 bartenders working at the time. We sat there for at least 10 minutes, we were never acknowledged not even a nod.. nothing. Please keep in mind the restaurant was not crowded at all.  We sat there a bit longer in disbelief of the treatment received at this point. Just as we were about to leave we see, a young lady walk up and takes a seat at the bar, within a few moments she was warmly greeted by one of the bartenders with menu in hand???? Seriously, wow??? Please understand this is not the first this has happen.  We have received this same treatment twice before.  Since it was a Sunday evening we hoped the service would be better...not the case. We asked to speak to the manager on duty. We spoke to the manager and she apologized profusely and offered us a meal on the house, which we refused.  Why would we want to have a meal at a place that clearly did not appreciate having us there as a guest?! The manager on duty promised the general manager would follow up with us to discuss our poor experience at the restaurant. Well it's been five weeks since our visit to SumoMaya, we have yet to receive a phone call...   SumoMaya- thank you for showing usthere are other restaurants nearby such as ...Paul Martins, Postinos and Fleming's who are consistent in providing an excellent dining experience for all their guests."}
{"text":"Fun Environment. Outstanding Guac. Meh Sushi.  I would have loved this joint if I were visiting for appetizers, drinks and fake tits.. but I was here for sushi. Unfortunately, SumoMaya fell short in this department. The whole fusion thing is a cool concept, but I feel some of the flavors clashed a bit. Giant chunks of cucumber in all the rolls pissed me off.  Service was great despite the place being packed."}
{"text":"Definitely not a date night! It is so loud it's ridiculous in here. But the food is amazing! Weird but amazing. When I say weird, I had popcorn in my Mexican corn. Lolz. Anyways. I had the wild mushroom tacos. It was super tasty, minus the sour cream. I think that was too much. A must. a MUSTTTTT. IS THE GUACAMOLE  It had promegranate, raisins and other fruits in it. It was delicious! Don't knock it until you try it. Oh and the sticky brownie with ice cream is to die for. Oh man. I want to go back now writing this review. Haha.  I LOVE THE TREE IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM. HAHA. SUPER CUTE.  And don't forget to being cash for valet.. :D   I shall be backkkkk."}
{"text":"Nothing better. Food, service, ambiance, it's a total food experience. Go and order lots!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  The food was not cheap, but it was worth every penny. The combination of ingredients and flavors is surprising & well matched, producing a unique and delicious outcome. Every bite was a party in my mouth. It instantly went to the top of my favorite restaurants list"}
{"text":"Attractive, crazy-noisy ambience.  Clean. Nice, polite, reasonably attentive staff.  Ahi tostadas had high quality, generously portioned ahi. Interesting flavor profile. Reasonably priced. Very happy.  Skip the spicy tuna roll and go to a more traditional sushi restaurant instead. Won't repeat order this one.  Pork pad thai was the most correctly priced item we ordered for quantity. Once again, very interesting flavors. Very happy.  Carne asada is a no. Tender. Very thiny sliced. For the quantity, exceedingly over priced. So-so on the flavor.  Not recalling the name of their \"extremely dense\" \"flourless\" chocolate desert. Chocolate cremo? Any way, skip it! The most disappointing item we tried. Dense? Maybe. Extreme chocolate flavor? Nope. It's topped with a catastrophe of gelatin which is, I believe, flavorless and very distracting. The gold flakes look attractive. But, who cares. And, no doubt that bumps the price of this thing into ridiculous. Fail here from a chocolate aficionado.   Would I return? Probably. Would it be on my \"must go back to\" list. No."}
{"text":"Where good and evil collide. Also where American-Mexican and American-Asian collide, which is a more neutral experience.  The waiter, though friendly, had literally never seen the menu. Ex. - Pork belly was galaxies away from his description: \"you know, it's like a classic pork belly.\" *re-enters moments later holding grilled grapes and miso caramel and a pig.* You get the idea.   More importantly, most of the women at the bar have Barbie bods and Furby faces, which is absolutely reason enough to go."}
{"text":"It was my second time there last night. The food is fresh and delicious. The sushi is excellent and so is the mixto ceviche. The service was pretty good considering how busy it was. Restrooms were a mess. They need to keep up on them so that's why they are losing a star. If you are looking for great food and some excellent people watching, SumoMaya is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I went here with about 8 girlfriends for a bachelorette party kick-off. We made reservations for 9:30pm but were not sat until about 10-:15pm. That was a little tedious but the wonderful service and food made up for the late start.   The football game I didn't want to miss was luckily displayed on one of their giant flatscreen HD TV's. I would definitely want to head back there to watch other sporting events in the future. The music was rather loud but as expected for a Saturday night at a happening spot. I don't know if their music is always that loud.   Once we were sat, our server was very attentive and fun. I wish I remembered his name! My roommate and I ordered the Sake Sangria and Passionfruit Sangria to sip on. Both sangrias were incredible!! We couldn't decide which one we liked more.  To start our meal, we shared the Crispy Pork Belly Roll. My roommate and I are huge fans of pork belly and this roll did not disappoint. Not only do we love pork belly, we love brussel sprouts, and this roll perfectly combined both things. I could have eaten a whole plate of those rolls!   Like I said, we love pork belly, so for our main dish we ordered the Pork Belly Ramen. It was equally as awesome as the roll. I would recommend it!  Unfortunately my roommate is very allergic to avocados...I know it breaks my heart too...so we were unable to order a lot of things off their menu since we were splitting. However, you better believe that means I'm going back and ordering everything with avocado at some point. However, I notified our server of her allergy and they made sure not to make her food where avocado had touched. So we had a successful evening without having to take out her epi-pen. They were very accommodating!  Can't wait to go back and try more food! I love their concept."}
{"text":"Good food. Crazy atmosphere. They sat me by a bunch of gays rather than at the open seat by sons eligible ladies ... The food is great but the. Host stand is questionable in thier judgment"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for this place. That being said, my experience was not bad, but it wasn't anything remarkable. With only one appetizer to share and one ceviche entree each, my friend and I spent around 45 each (which seemed steep even for Scottsdale). I would give it another try, but it may be a while."}
{"text":"Great food, but a little pricey.  If you dine here during happy hour, they have great specials.  Love the vibe and atmosphere of the restaurant.  Must try the street corn."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, fabulous service.  We tried the Rock Shrimp, Charred Edamame, Chili Crab Noodles, and Sea Bass. We would highly recommend all four dishes, with the Sea Bass being a must-have! Michelle was our server, and the service she gave us was nothing short of spectacular."}
{"text":"Loved this place! First time here and the Red Dragon Roll and Korean beef tacos were amazing!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because of all the raving reviews. I came here on a Thursday evening for happy hour. The bar area was pretty busy and we found seats at the hi-top table. We ordered the crab guacamole, sushi rolls, shishito peppers, and the bacon wrapped dates. The only dish I would come back for is the guac.... But for the price I'd rather go elsewhere. The sushi was okay buy nothing to come back for.  Would I come back here you ask?? Sorry, sumo you wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"The food here is great.  The wait to get in, not so great.  Hip trendy place to hang out.  The music is very loud and maybe not a place to take a date or kids.  It is a fun place to go every now and then."}
{"text":"Food a bit on the pricey side for the amount that you get. Ordered appetizers and our meal at the same time. We barely had a few bites of the apps before the rest of the meal showed up.  I get that it is served tapas style but then why as if you want appetizers. Warning to self - order apps then wait until almost finished before placing meal order.  I am not sure why you can only get happy hour pricing while sitting at the bar - it is too hard to have a conversation with 5 or more people sitting in a row. Only have been here a handful of times - doubtful that I would become a regular.   The only real highlight was our waitress Lucia - she was a rockstar."}
{"text":"Very good fusion, which is saying a lot for me as I typically think fusion is a great way to screw up two national cuisines. This place has a fun atmosphere. There are massive televisions though no one is watching them. Also, there is a live tree growing through the floorboards.   I had the Rainbow Ceviche, which was great. Not sure where you get fresh fish in a desert, but this was damn good. After agonizing about which direction to go, I ended up with the Korean Beef Tacos and the Al Pastor Pad Thai. The tacos were incredible. They were very small, but the flavors were perfect. All the ingredients fresh and the spice on the meat was spot on. The pad thai was also quite good, but it was a bit sweet for my palate. It also didn't help that I felt compelled to eat every last bite without regard to my fullness.   All in all, this place deserved it's rating. I would recommend it to those going on a date or just looking for a fun fusion meal. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Interesting place, food is good and fresh , small portions but pricey, which i dont mind, on weekends nights dj , very loud, but good energy!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is so good! My favorite is their crispy fish street tacos. It's also decorated very well and has a nice atmosphere. The only down side is that the portions are very tiny for how much money they cost. Because of that, I try to stick to their happy hour, which is a good deal!"}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is excellent and far exceeded my expectations.  It's a very nice looking place in a convenient location.  They had the best pork pad Thai I've ever eaten.  We were delighted with everything."}
{"text":"Unique menu, solid atmosphere, great flavors and knowledgable staff.  Felt like they were a bit understaffed, but had a good crew. Overall, plates were very tasty, but this hits the realm of Scottsdale restaurants that get a little ambitious on their pricing for what they are actually putting on the plate."}
{"text":"Had dinner here opening night, there was a lot of energy in the place - it was buzzing. Really well designed space with a giant tree in the middle and clean, modern design with tricked out lighting. We were greeted welcomingly at the host stand then promptly seated at the sushi bar. At first it was a little overwhelming - I mean sushi, multiple kinds of salsa, tacos, pho - a mixed bag of asian/mexican as promised so we decided to order a course off of each menu area.  We started with the Suzuki Roll - beautiful and delicious with just the perfect amount of crunch and heat. Then we had the lump crab guacamole - with the guac itself being very tasty and well put together and the 'lump' crab being somewhat lacking for a $14 dish. Our conclusion was we'd order the guac again but skip on the crab.  Moving on we had the Mexican Pho - a tasty take on the Vietnamese classic with queso and cilantro. Yum. Along with that the mussels, some of the largest i've seen, in a green coconut & lime - terrific heavy cream sauce that didn't seem too out of the ordinary in a Mexican fusion way.  Then we ordered tacos - they were already out of Pastor so we opted for Chicken - these were tasty little morsels of goodness on some kind of fresh corn tortilla.   We were already getting full so we opted to wait to do any of the larger entree style or wok prepared items. We finished off with an Hamachi roll with slices of fresh jalapeno on top. Yumm. Overall it was a great experience and it will only get better as the staff gets into the groove of things.  BOTTOM LINE:  Get your Mexican Sushi on here! We'll definitely be back to explore the fun and diverse menu."}
{"text":"We've been going here since it opened. If i had written the review last year I would have definitely given them 5 stars. Food was always amazing as well as the service. I have to say, in the past few months the food tastes different. Not everything, but most items we have ordered no longer taste like they used to. The waiter suggested that it possibly has to do with some items now being gluten free?? The only item that still tastes the same and is delicious is the bacon guacamole. Always amazing and I highly recommend trying it! Everything is just blah. The service the past few times we've been has been soso."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is Amazing! The environment is very elegant and relaxing. People are very friendly and nice. They just need to update the dessert selection or make a dessert menu. Mixed drinks are really good! Sushi was the best! Something that you can't have in your regular cheap place. I keep going back here whenever I come to the city."}
{"text":"Nothing stood out to me. Passion fruit cocktail was mediocre. Passion fruit sangria was disgusting. Tacos were average. Appetizers strange."}
{"text":"Sumo maya serves their food mostly tapas style, so it is a great place to go and sample multiple things on the menu. They have a very interesting menu of Spanish and Asian fusion; everything from tacos and guacamole to sushi. I definitely recommend the Korean beef and fish tacos, they were our favorite by far. Their specialty cocktails are also fantastic! I ordered the Thai basil and it was amazing. A little pricey for the portion size, but all of the food we ordered was flavorful and very good."}
{"text":"Wow! Very neat place. Fantastic atmosphere. Fun, lively, great raised view of bustling, gorgeous Scottsdale Rd. We were there to make a big, somewhat stressful financial decision, and the happiness motivated us to just \"go for it\" haha! So far so good. Thanks for the great experience! I'm vegan and the waitress was able to help me make some choices. I almost forgot! The pomegranate guacamole....sets the bar for guac. Well done."}
{"text":"I am currently sitting at the bar of this lovely new restaurant and am happy to say that my butt is the first one to have officially sat here! Huzzah! This place has a few kinks to work out, as it is opening day, first seating, but it has some serious potential. The managers/ owners graciously allowed me to try a few of their cocktails on the house and all were tasty. The clear standout is the frozen coconut mojito! Extremely delicious. I also had the coconut drink, which was very pure in coconut flavor and the passionfruit drink (10$ normal price, 8$ hh) which was gingery and smokey and overall unlike anything i have had before. Plus this place has hard a on tap... Cool stuff. For food we trued the following:  dates wrapped in bacon - very tasty... How could it not be? It's a date with cheese and chorizo inside and wrapped in bacon on top of a foie gras sauce.... Come on!  chicken tacos- very flavorful but tiny... I would like more for sure!  traditional guac- flavorful and plentiful, but served with weird tostada type chips... Good tasting and clearly house made, but awkward to eat.  pollo chcharrones- so yummy with the  miso mustard... Nicely done!  this place is a definite return to place, reasonable prices, good drinks, nice hh, and interesting food (not to mention cute decor).   check it out yelpers!  ps, first!!"}
{"text":"This was my 4th visit to this restaurant. Third for the brunch. During my first 3 visits I loved everything about this place! The food was great and the service was excellent. This Sunday I decided to bring my family for a special occasion - my mom's birthday. I thought it would be perfect. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Some of the food was too bland while other was overspiced. We ordered poke bowl and it was extremely spicy without a warning. We had to ask several times our waiter to bring the food out. Or to give us more coffee. Instead of this being a relaxing and enjoyable experience this was extremely annoying and stressful one. We waited for the first course for a long time especially for our favourite guacamole. The waiter brought just one guacamole for 7 people after I asked for 2 in the beginning. I had to ask 2 more times until he brought another one out. If I order food I expect it to come out for us to eat not ask several times for it. Our side dishes came out way after we were done with the main course! At some point we just sat there with a table full of dishes and no one bothered to clear them before our desert came out.  I was so disappointed that I kept on apologizing to my mom for such an awful experience. I am never coming back and I will discourage other people from going to this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times. The food is always terrific. I love the atmosphere...it is a great \"people watching\" place. I appreciate the complimentary valet parking. The happy hour is great.  But - I will say that my waitress was slow! So I have to knock them down for that. She passed by us 3 times saying that she would bring more water."}
{"text":"We had a PERFECT dinner during Restaurant Week!  Our server, Chris, was the BEST!!!!   Great suggestions, fabulous personality, spot on pacing, and made us feel like special guests.  We had 4 apps-Guac, Rock Shrimp, Shrimp Ceviche, and Calamari.  All were over the top delish.  For entrees we enjoyed the Shaking Beef and Miso sea Bass-just enough food after the generous apps.  We completed our meal (reluctantly-never wanting the fun to end) with a Butterscotch Panna Cotta.  Now I have never thought I liked Panna Cotta-but this was fabulous-creamy with a buttery sauce topped with nuts and paired with a refreshing Mango Sorbet-unusual but delightful!  Even though it was a crazy busy night-Chris was always checking in and never rushed us!  Those Sabercats always know how to hit a home run!"}
{"text":"Good food and pleasant waitress.  Overpriced for what you get compared to similar restaurants.  Easy to spend $200 for 2 people and sit next to some d****ebag with a backwards baseball hat.  Hilariously awful overall experience and ambiance."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my sister for my birthday. I loved the food and restaurant however it was extremely loud!!   So we ordered the bacon guacamole, chicken tinga tacos, the Mexican street corn. My sister also ordered a rice dish but I can't remember what it was. I also ordered the coconut cocktail which was really good. The restaurant is tapas style so we shared everything and had a lot of left overs. Every single dish was delicious!!   We felt really underdressed. I loved the decor of the restaurant and the ambience. However for a Friday night it's extremely loud and it's definitely the spot to go to before a night out on the town. Everyone was pretty dressed up to go out after. Lol. I really loved the food though so I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"So who's going to mix Mexican and Chinese or Japanese or whatever together this place does. It's so hip here it's almost pretentious. Great people watching especially the Scottsdale women"}
{"text":"Always came here for dinner but came here for brunch after my spin class for the first time. I had no idea they had bottomless brunch for $29 a person!! Amazing deal!! And they had a live band!! How fun!!!  So for $29 a person, I got the blood orange mimosa. Did I tell you it's unlimited??? And you can pick an appetizer and this is unlimited too!! My husband got the yogurt, granola n fresh fruit and I got the huevos revueltos al albanil and the chef's assorted sushi rolls. Did I mention these items are unlimited so u can order as many as u want?? So exciting!! (I Iuv food!!) It was amazing!! The eggs were so buttery n fluffy I ended up getting two orders!!! Assorted sushi rolls were delicious too!! You get three diff types (2 of each kind) so 6 total. Yum!!  As my entree, I got the enchiladas suizas with a side of Chinese sausage fried rice w pineapple. These are all included in ur bottomless brunch!! Such a great deal!! And the food was amazing!!! My husband got the wagyu steak n eggs w wok fried breakfast potatoes!! I had a bite and both was perfection!!! And you get a dessert as well!! Can u say food heaven???!!! I got the bunuelos which r crispy cinnamon tortillas and my husband got the liquid cheesecake!! Both so delicious but obviously I had to take a lot of food home!!   I highly recommend this place for brunch as well as dinner. Only small hiccup was that I had to ask for salsa n hot sauce to three different people and no one brought it to me for over 15 min... so I finally just had to walk over n flag our server down.. my eggs were just staring at me (hehe) i just really wanted to eat my eggs w some hot sauce. But not a big deal since I noticed she had a huge party...    Overall, amazing food!! Super fun atmosphere!! Definitely a place to check out!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge foodie. I love trying out new places and when I read about a restaurant that serves Mexican/Asian cuisine, I was pretty excited to check it out. First of all, the restaurant itself is amazing! It's beautifully decorated. You can tell that there was a lot of detail and creativity put into the design. Our server, Nicole, was incredible! She was sweet and very funny. She definitely made my first time here very welcoming. Her knowledge on the menu was great, and she was able to recommend the green chili pomegranate chicken enchiladas. They were AMAZING. I will definitely be checking this place out again and recommend it to family and friends."}
{"text":"Very different vibe going in for lunch/happy hour vs dinner. Preferred the more laid back mid day atmosphere more than the \"club like\"  evening crowd. Pretty good service. Best dish I've had is the Pork Belly Ramen. AMAZING."}
{"text":"One of the best Sushi place I have ever been! The place is great, the people are great, and of course the food is awesome!.. I am a sushi fanatic so I know what a very good sushi taste like.. very impressive!.."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving this a 4 star as I'm sitting here at the place writing this is the service.  First time here and had a few friends that highly recommended this place after making a brunch reservation and it was really good like they said.   For the price and area this can't be beat bottomless drink of choice with unlimited side servings and one main dish make this place perfect for brunch. When walking in the vibe is upbeat and modern. The cook area is wide open to watch them cook and you can sit right in front of them and be served. In the back is a sushi bar if that's what your craving and you also have a few outside places to eat as well. Great spot for a group or like us a perfect date.   The food was amazing all the way to the dessert but like mentioned before the service was slow. After being sat it took probably 15 minutes just to place our first order   It felt like the server kept forgetting what he was doing and attended to the bigger tables more then anything.   This won't stop is from coming back what won us over was the food and atmosphere.  Must stop here if you're in the area for the weekend."}
{"text":"My favorite place in the state of AZ!!! Just phenomenal, top tier quality across the board. Everything is cooked to perfection, the service is great"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch around 10:30 and got seated right away on the patio. Our waitress was very attentive and made some good suggestions for us since it was our first time here. Would highly recommend the bacon guacamole as an appetizer-so tasty! My husband had a Tokyo Mule to drink (crisp, refreshing) and the short rib eggs benedict. I ordered the Mexican omelette which was delicious-perfect chorizo stuffed inside! Would highly recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"So this was our 3rd time at this restaurant. We went for Sunday night dinner. After the service was so bad the last time, we hadn't been back in a couple of years, We had the bacon-wrapped dates, the miso eggplant and some sushi. It was all pretty good. The bacon was a bit overcooked but still tasty. Unfortunately, they still haven't fixed their problem with service. The waitress took forever to take our orders and rarely checked on us afterwards. One of the helpers brought out sushi but we still had no soy sauce. The \"helper\" brought MORE of the sushi, but again still no soy sauce & no sign of our waitress. We had to go scrounge some from the sushi bar. She didn't refill our drinks either. It was very frustrating for what is supposedly an upscale restaurant."}
{"text":"Revisited for dinner and had a fabulous evening.  Our server (I believe his name was Mark???) was spot on.  He was knowledgeable about the menu, courteous, and never let any of our drinks go empty.  I truly appreciate good service like this, which is what my last visit was severly lacking.  The food was spectacular....everything we had, from the margaritas to the octopus nigiri.  I love their selection of delicious foods offered and will continue to revisit this great restaurant."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place! Went for lunch. Sat at the bar. Ordered 2 rolls, ramen and shishito peppers. Rolls were delicious. Shishito's were in too sweet of a sauce for me but my husband loved them. The brightest star was the Ramen. We've been trying it all over the country lately and this is the winner. Perfectly cooked, crispy pork belly and smoky mushrooms in savory broth. Jeremy was great and the Grapefruit cocktail and signature Margarita were perfect desert summer drinks. Oh, and manager came by to check on everything. We were at the bar so that doesn't happen often. Very cool!"}
{"text":"I like that the food is fresh and tastes good.  I like how clean and trendy the place looks and feels.  It's weird in a good way and they obviously put a lot of effort into making it look like high quality.   I don't like the mount of noise.  It is ridiculously loud for my taste but they trendy folk seem to thrive in it.  Service was ok, but definitely not great.    This place is good for eating, good for stimulating your senses but not for having a nice conversation with your friends."}
{"text":"Update: I had to take it from 5 to 4 stars because I did NOT like BRUNCH and if you going during the brunch menu (also on holidays), you are required to eat it (or a VERY limited bar menu). After trying it twice, I will never go there for brunch again, but will continue to go when there is a full menu.   PREVIOUS REVIEW (during Happy Hour): I am now a complete fan. I am excited it was so close to my home! The cocktails are so varied and all quality. The food was good. The guac was simple but yummy. The salmon avocado role was fine -- nothing special. I absolutely will be going back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at SumoMaya and was not familiar with their menu. I was greeted with free valet and was seated in a very comfortable corner table for 2. The waiter was not only delightful but knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We started the dinner with an order of Mexican street corn which came decorated with popcorn. It was slightly hot but in the most amazing way. Next ordered 2 al pastor tacos and 2 pescado tacos. Both selections were delicious and simply just fresh on each ingredient. For my drink I ordered the Tokyo mule which came with a lil kick in it as well and in an very enjoyable way. Finished with arroz marisco dish that the waiter brought out in an artistic looking pot. Mixed the fried egg with a large spoon and this combination of flavors made out to be the reason why I'll return. The scenery is beautiful but the food is the real winner here"}
{"text":"Loved this place. We had guacamole with pomegranate seeds,edemame, popcorn and yummy tacos. Loved it all.  Had tres Leche's cake for dessert  was fabulous.  Loved it all"}
{"text":"Wow, what combinations and so creative.  After a work conference, I broke away for lunch, and what a surprise!  I started with the Coconut Ahi Tuna tartar. This is tuna covered with a coconut reduction, and then placed inside a coconut with shredded coconut on the bottom. Comes with a wedge of lime and crispy plantains. I first ate the tuna without the lime, and there was a nice sweetness to the tuna, but adding the lime later on gave the tuna the classic ceviche taste! Highly recommended.  Next was the Korean Beef tacos with grilled pineapples. The sweet pineapples and pickled onions was a perfect contrast to the Korean beef tacos. Add the avocado and you have a creamy taco with lots of flavor.  The final frontier, dessert! There is no dessert menu, it was provided verbally. When I heard the dessert, I knew that was the one. She said \"Churro Cheesecake\"! The cheesecake itself seems to have a hint of cinnamon added, and then pieces of churro was added on top, then sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar to make it complete. Comes with a side of vanilla ice cream. Makes me with there was more pieces of churro but that was plenty of sugar already.  Fantastic meal with surprise parings, there menu has a lot more to offer, I just tried the items that appealed to me!"}
{"text":"The name of this place is a bit ridiculous so I wasn't expecting too much, but I ended up pleasantly surprised. SumoMayo is pretty good for Asian/Mexican food, but definitely not the best in either category by itself. It's great to have all the options so I would come here again with a group or for work, but would opt for pure sushi or pure Mexican joints for a date night. Appetizers were great and so were the guacs and fried rices, though they were on the sweet side. Food kept coming out as it was ready, which is great when with a group. The servers were not great about filling waters, but otherwise were sufficient, though I would expect better service for the prices. I did love the open walls and the plants that were part of the walls!"}
{"text":"The one thing I was disappointed with was the Shaking Beef.  It was tasty, don't get me wrong, but the upsell on this item is a little too blatent.  On the menu for (I believe) $28, the server conveniently suggested we get it with the noodles...that'll tack on an additional $6 bucks.  The guac was good, the drink selection was suberb.  The last games of the NBA season was on so I was able to steal glances of Kobe lighting it up and the Warriors winning their 73rd on big screen TVs.  The bar scene looked good from afar (ahh the memories).  I also had the Mahi Mahi which was smothered in the tomato goo.  Should have gone with the Sea Bass...  The other thing that was lacking was the pace of the meal.  My wife and I had the quac, another appetizer, and two main courses, and we were in and out of the restaurant in 50 minutes.  The dishes come out as they are ready, but the pace felt frantic."}
{"text":"Impressive! Everything we ordered was super savory & tasty. There's a cool tree in the middle of the restaurant & they keep the patio open which makes it feel like your in a nice backyard party even when you're inside. It's a little pricey but it's not the usual so it's worth it. Will return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great vibes and great food out there! I went there with my ex for her birthday. I reserved the seat for us and they had the surprising birthday cake for free! The food there is expensive for a college student like me but definitely a great place to treat your girlfriend or someone who is important to you."}
{"text":"Can not thank this place enough! I have been here with friends, family (including our 10 year old who LOVED IT!), business associates, and to entertain clients. This is my go to spot for, \"Look how cool Az is!\" Or the occasional, \"Look how cool I am for knowing about it!\" Let me start by saying I am PICKY! I don't eat sugar or grains. So a Mexican Asian fusion wasn't the best plan maybe? False, they catered to my clean eating like almost no one ever has! When I can go somewhere and have TACOS...YES 6 different kinds of TACOS, which they wrapped in lettuce and cabbage for me instead of tortillas...best! I also had some Sea Bass, the BESSSSSSST Guacamole on this planet! One with Crab, one with Ribeye and one with Pomegranate even! Oh, and I don't eat chips...so they brought me cucumbers to dip in it! Wow. When I came back? Same story again and again! Great service, so fair priced, short wait. COMPLIMENTARY VALET...yep I said it. Not to mention the greatest food and atmosphere Az and Scottsdale has to offer. Well done Sumo Maya. 3 years strong I see why. HOT SPOT."}
{"text":"I do like this place. I tried it twice before and wasn't impressed with the food. This time I came and tried the Thai soup and Korean friend rice and liked it a lot better than the sushi and tacos I had ordered previous times. I took 2 stars off for their ridiculous wine by the glass prices & the crazy loud noise in the evenings. This is definitely a place \"to see and be seen\" - very hip. I highly recommend their blackberry margarita!"}
{"text":"We only got appetizers from the happy hour menu. The bacon wrapped figs and edamame were to die for! Our party also got tacos and those seemed to be pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Awesome food, terrible service!  Came here to celebrate my birthday with my family, so there was a group of 8, which they couldn't handle. We had to ask our waitress 3 or 4 times for things and they don't seem to be educated on food allergies. She kept getting gluten free mixed up with Vegan and thought Vegan was Vegetarian. I know people with special food requests like that can be rather annoying but c'mon, if you're in the food industry, you should educate yourself so you don't make people sick.   I have to say that the food and atmosphere is pretty great. This place is like Asia meets Mexico, which creates some really unique flavors. They have various types of guacamole, which are out of this world. Everything is  small plate so it's perfect for sharing. I definitely recommend the pomegranate guacamole.   The one downside is that the food arrives as it's ready so that resulted in everyone getting their food at different times. Pretty much everyone was done eating by the time I received my friend rice. This concept is good for drinks and appetizers maybe, but not for entrees. The kitchen seemed to get backed up at times resulting in long waits. We waiting over 20 minutes just for a dessert to come...and it wasn't even right. Perhaps the managers/owners should take a closer look.  This place is good for smaller groups it seems."}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  I recommend the crab guac, and the Shakin Steak - so yummy, I am ready to go back for more.  We had a really good time."}
{"text":"Came in with a group for lunch. They have a fun atmosphere and interesting menu. Food is reasonably priced. The different guacamoles they have were a lot of fun and seemed to be a hit with everyone."}
{"text":"I've been three times so far and have had a great experience each time.   Awesome decor. The synthetic tree in the middle of the dining room (you'd never know it isn't real) just makes it along with the $1mln bar.   The food is generally fantastic with a few items that are \"only\" very good and therefore just a couple of ticks below life changing. I'd strongly recommend the Miso glazed sea bass, the Pork Pad Thai and the Guacamole with crab.   The service has always been excellent.  Value for the money is pretty stellar. Most menu items are under $20.   The only thing I would change is how loud the dining room is. I love background music and high energy music in a social setting is cool too, but not so loud that I can't have a conversation.   Bonus points to the ever-present McLarens, Ferraris, Aston Martins and Porsches parked out front. It's pure entertainment watching Scottsdale millionaires pull up in their Beemers and Benzes only to see the valet team treat their car like a run of the mill Toyota."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at SumoMaya. Our waiter Phillipe was awesome. Food and drinks were exactly what we had hoped for!"}
{"text":"We had sushi, fried calamari, korean beef tacos, and a tamarind shrimps with smelly shiitake mushrooms (that plate really stinks!), and non-alcoholic mojitos (very good!). Food tasted good, excellent presentation, great concept. But portions were way too small, that was disappointing. Probably we won't go back."}
{"text":"It's very good, and hip!  The atmosphere is really cool, with a tree in the middle of the restaurant. The food is very tasty.  We enjoyed the sushi, the noodle dishes, and the street tacos. It is tapas style, so the bill can add up, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Fusion is dangerous territory. You either pull it off or you don't.  Unfortunately it was a miss for us on all counts and we ordered over four dishes.   Taco Maria in CA is the epitome of great fusion w Mexican flavors.  I think for the price, you would do far better at La Hacienda in AZ. For a tastier, cheaper alternative try Barrio Queen. Both are less fusiony though."}
{"text":"Cool spot, nice d√©cor and the food was really great.  I went for the huevos divoriados and while the portion was small the flavors were great.  My wife had the pho and I would say it was flavorful but not my fave.  No wifi?  seriously?  That is why we go with 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"An excellent foodplace with a lively bar & ambience. Went in for dinner & drinks after work with my colleagues. Liked the place very much. We tried the Maya Roll, Billionaire Roll,  Mexican Shrimp Cocktail, Rock Shrimp Tempura, Lobster and Crab \"Dynamite\" & Seasonal Mushrooms. Each & every dish had its own taste & beauty in presentation. Customer service is excellent as well. Make sure you place your reservation in early."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Will be back many more times. Tuna ceviche and Rollo ching on were to die for!"}
{"text":"Good drinks, awesome sushi, good guacamole.  Their brunch is so interesting, and I can't say enough about the mushroom omelette.  It's fantastic.  Their guacamole are all good, especially the bacon guac.  Their sushi is so unusual,  and I'm always pleased with what we order.  They also have great drinks and bartenders.  They had a dj the last evening we were there, which was very cool.  Great spot for groups or date night!"}
{"text":"This was my third time here. I usually come for happy hour and came one time for a full dinner. The food is excellent and they do a creative job of trying to fuse Mexican and Asian food. Good drinks good appetizers and a good crowd. Will be going back."}
{"text":"this is a review for weekend brunch. a much more civilized endeavor compared to what transpires after dark at SuMa (and that's WITH the bottomless mimosas).  So the bloody mary mix is top notch. but I tend to go with the bottomless mimosas because there are multiple flavors and you can mix and match to your hearts content (pineapple and blood orange are my top 2).  as for the rolls, the Salmon Apple is my favorite. off the desayuno side, the huevos divorciados, and for something unique, get their twist on Pho.  and i love how they have huge screens with football on but it's somehow just in the background and not the centerpiece of the floor plan. which is nice because you can glace over and see how your fantasy season is rapidly imploding along with your RB1s knees but it won't be rubbed in your face. This lets you get back to celebrating the awesomeness that is SuMa with your bottomless beverage in hand.  PS: If you could give six stars for service, they would have it."}
{"text":"Very good! Amazing soups and good sushi (I ordered the pork belly roll...nice and crispy!!) I've been impressed by the chocolate cake with nuts and gelato...FABULOUS!!! *-*"}
{"text":"SumoMaya is one of those \"places to be\" in Scottsdale.  Tons of gorgeous people, lit-up trees, large screen TVs.  It's a little too loud for an intimate dinner - we came for an interview dinner and had problems hearing each other - but it's definitely the right place for a night out on the town.  Our group got the \"Omakase,\" which means the chef sends you whatever food he thinks you'll like.  I started off with the Chinga Tu Maya, which was a very unique drink with black sesame-salt around the rim.  It had great flavor (not too sweet!) and went well with all our dishes.  And there were a LOT of dishes.  My favorites (and the most memorable) were the king crab guacamole, the ahi tuna tostada, the miso chilean sea bass (so buttery! probably the best out of all the dishes) and the yellowtail roll.  We unfortunately weren't sent many sushi or ceviche items.  I was disappointed in this, since I'm a huge sushi fan and really wanted to try SumoMaya's rolls.  We did get sent huge filling platters of chicken tinga tacos, rice dishes, corn, broccolini, and pad thai, and we were stuffed by the time we walked out.  Wish we could have had some more of the unique seafood dishes, though.  All in all, fun place to try out for a night."}
{"text":"I always forget how amazing this place is. It's unique in that it has very two distinct personalities. I will go there with my friends for happy hour and grab a snack, and I've also taken foodie clients there for a business meal. My only warning is that you have to be careful if you were entertaining guests as it can be a bit noisy, crowded, and with often slow service. But this is just because it is a very cool and hip spot... unfortunately, this is the only reason it's getting four and not five stars.  How can you not go wrong with an Asian and Mexican mix of food! I know it sounds strange, but some of the food combinations are simply amazing. For something as simple as guacamole, there is this some of the best that I've had, particularly the pomegranate guacamole option. It may sound a bit strange, but trust me it's a very subtle and unexpected twist on a classic...And the hand fried whole tortillas are extra crunchy and amazing!  We ended up ordering about 10 or 12 entr√©es to share on my last visit, so I don't want to name them all but the kimchi fried rice, Chilean Seabass, and some of the noodle options are simply outstanding. Of everything I've eaten there, there's not a single thing that I wouldn't order again.  And please don't stop at the food... Be sure to get drinks! The cocktail menu is phenomenal as well. If you happen to be visiting on a hot day, be sure to try the blended mojito. It's one of the most refreshing and delicious drinks I've ever had...just maybe save it for dessert as it is quite sweet. There are a ton of other drinks on the menu that are worth having before you get to that one."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding.  Portions are rather small.  The place is REALLY loud. And some spots are REALLY dark.  Needed our flashlights to order and to see our food.  Our service was dismal but others around us seemed to be getting good service. Reservations strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"The Greenberg/Keller Group from Chicago is so thankful for our amazing waiter Josh. He was so on top of things and we have never had a better waiter. The food was also amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely incredible, I have yet to try something on the menu I do not like. HOWEVER I must warn everyone to SAVE YOUR RECEIPT because my credit card was up charged after a recent visit. I called  SumoMaya and they took down my number and then had someone from the management company call me. I was unable to answer when she called (on Friday) so she said she would call me on Monday. I never received another call. I was only charged $5 more than I should've been so I wasn't going to waste time out of my day over 5 bucks. The only reason I called in the first place was because of principle. The server had added and additional $5 to her tip after I had already left her over 20%. I do not appreciate the dishonesty of the server but will be a returning customer due to the outstanding food."}
{"text":"I don't as a rule give 5 Stars but my family (4) closed out our trip to Phoenix with dinner at SumoMaya...and OH WOW!!  There wasn't one dish we didn't absolutely love; Pomegranate Guacamole, Charred Edamame, Hamachi Roll, Red Dragon Roll, Mixto Classico, Tuna Tacos, Miso Chilean Sea Bass, Vietnamese Style \"Shaking Beef\" and Sticky Chocolate Cake!  The flavors were amazing!  SumoMaya is definitely now on our list of must eat places when we are in Phoenix!  Go and enjoy, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation in advance. Confirmed it. Came, waited for an hour. Manager was rude and obnoxious. Would never recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"Brittany is amazing! Best server we've had here. She knows how to keep my glass full! Thank you sumomaya :)"}
{"text":"Went to SumoMaya with some rowdy lady friends last weekend and LOVED IT!  The d√©cor is modern & sexy (complete with low-lighting), and the DJ plays absolutely fabulous music- lots of current pop and hip hip.   IMO, SumoMaya definitely has a \"dinner night club\" vibe and isn't a spot I'd suggest if you're looking for a quiet, low-key romantic dinner.   However, for a night out with friends it's perfect!  I started off with the superfruit sangria and it was delish! One of my friends tried the passion fruit version and it was way too tarty and not sweet enough. Needless to say after she sampled a swig of mine, she sent hers back to swap.  We tried a bunch of different starters and all were uber tasty- the pomegranate guacamole was particularly good. It has pomegranate seeds and dried cranberry in addition to the traditional guac ingredients. It only needed a tad bit more salt to be truly perfect. They serve it with enormous round crisp tortillas which are very good.  For my entr√©e I had the rock tempura shrimp and it was delectable to say the least. Fried to perfection with a very yummy sauce! It was a more than generous serving also which was a plus.  We visited SumoMaya on a busy Friday evening around 6:30 and I will say that our server was less than attentive. There was definitely a lag between each of us getting our entrees even though we all ordered at the same time. Some of us ate while others sat for an additional 10-12 minutes waiting on our food! If they improve that aspect of the dining experience, SumoMaya will be worthy of another star. Would visit again!"}
{"text":"Pretty awesome concept that is hard to pull off but Sumomaya has done it.  If you want to go to a trendy restaurant that can satisfy a group of picky eaters who wants different ethnic cusine, you want to try Sumomaya.  Ceviche and tacos were spot on.  Sushi and rolls were excellent - fresh and tasty.  I would recommend Suzuki roll like many other yelpers; however it does have strong cumin or tumeric after taste so it definitely is not a typical japanese roll.  The pomegranate guacamole was very good as well but again be warned that it is a bit spicy.  I tried their Pork Pad Thai (one of their more popular dish) but it was a bit too salty for me just like their seaweed salad (very salty cucumber pieces which didn't add anything to the dish).  The coconut soup was divne -  I really enjoyed the coconut curry soup and it was well presented like all of their other dishes."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had, server Jordyn was AWESOME. Place was packed, make a reservation hours if not days before! The matcha mojito, steak and Jordan Chardonnay were to die for all of the ladies in my group loved their sushi! Atmosphere is 110% appealing. Everyone seems like they were having an awesome time. Prices are up there but you get what you pay for!!!! Would recommend this place to everyone!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times with friends and we always have had a great time. I love the atmosphere here. The service is ok but I still would not give them anything less than 5 stars because they are very busy and running around. The food and drinks keep me coming back-we love happy hour and the great deals and options that are available. I recommend this place to anyone that wants a great meal that is affordable."}
{"text":"I normally go here later afternoon or for a very early happy hour.  My daughter loves the french fries they have and they're served only for lunch.  Of course I love the sushi and the Sumo-Rita!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Rate it as 3 stars as the music is very loud making it more of a bar experience.  Hard to hold a conversation with the person next to you."}
{"text":"Great location and Great Food.  Is got a very cool vibe running through the place and it shows in the food.  Its like a cut of Los Angeles meets the streets of Ponsonby back in New Zealand.  Enjoyable, delightful and tasty."}
{"text":"First time here for my Dad and me. Even during the noon hour, we were seated immediately.  The tables for two are really tiny, so when 3 menus per person and a variety of dinner ware is in front of you, there is very little room for food.    The menu is the most interesting, fusion fare I've ever see.  I enjoyed the selection. I settled in miso soup and a bowl of green tea soba noodles with okra.   They confused my miso soup order with something else and I sent it back. It took a while to get the soup. My Dad ordered the most exquisite dragon roll and a delicious, giant cup of coffee. He had to ask twice for cream and sugar.   The many pesky menus were not cleared for us until we were almost done our meals.  Our water glasses were not refilled. Just a few rookie moves need to be attended to for my rating to improve.  I would love to come back and try everything. I like the open kitchen concept.   The bar is beautiful. The large screen TVs are placed well with no volume.   The music is top 40, but low volume.   Pricing is decent. Like I said, it's a great new place, but I need a few service improvements."}
{"text":"Drinks here were great! That's it!  I felt a little uncomfortable walking into this place. If you drive anything older than a 2016 you will more than likely feel out of place. We came here as a party. The table that we made reservations for was not ready at the reservation time. We sat at the bar in the mean time where we received less an excellent service. (I didn't get the excellent drink until we were finally sat at our reserved table)"}
{"text":"Had a reservation, was super excited to go. Arrived to find out parking is valet only. I (like many) do not valet my car.  And so we left.  WARNING VALET ONLY"}
{"text":"This restaurant was an absolute delight on our recent trip to Scottsdale, last Saturday. We arrived @ 6pm without a reservation but scored a seat at the bar overlooking the kitchen. Turned out to be the best seat in the house! Luckily, our son who's confined to a power wheelchair, was able to pull up to the end next to the fixed seats where my husband & I sat. We started with the pomegranate guacamole & bacon wrapped medjool dates (AMAZING dates!, the very BEST thing I ate). Both, I'd most definitely order again. Our son ordered a drink that was right up my alley, a green 'magic' mojito. YUM!!! Had I not been driving, I would have ordered one, too! We also wanted to try the Korean beef taco. Typically there are only 2 tacos per order, but our server, Nina (who was very friendly), offered to add another so we could each have our own.Good call! For our mains, we ordered & shared the miso chilean sea bass, the pork \"al pastor\" pad thai and the shaking beef. All were delicious! Everything on the menu looks good. We truly delighted in having a front row seats to watch the cooks turn out such mouthwatering dishes. After we finished, we were most certainly thinking about trying the tres leeches cake which we had been enthralled by watching the chef make several times before our eyes. What precision! Low & behold, as we were waiting for dessert menus to be delivered, we were presented that very same dessert (fire candle & all!) to enjoy, on the house! We were SO blown away by such a kind gesture! Thank you for making our dining experience & our last night on vacation such a pleasurable experience! Our only regret was having to fly home early the next morning & not being able to try their brunch. SumoMaya, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food...loved it!  I wasn't quite sure what to expect and ended up a fan.  The food was outstanding and arrived extremely quickly.  We were there on a Saturday, so the prompt food delivery was impressive.  Our server was excellent and really knew the menu/products and was very helpful with her recommendations.  We had a couple of people with several food allergies and our server was awesome in helping us make selections that would work for everyone.  Some of our favorite selections included the guacamole with pomegranate, rollo chignon, pork 'al pastor' taco and the ceviche of the day (was sea bass for us).  The drinks were very good as well.  I will definitely be back...can't wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Server was friendly and went the extra step to ensure food was prepared special order."}
{"text":"Great ambience and interesting food with the whole texmex-asian fusion concept. Cool indoor/outdoor spot for drinks and appetizers. This place is loud and full of energy so not the type of place you'd want to go for a quiet, romantic dinner. It gets busy so call ahead for a reservation. We went for a birthday dinner and they surprised the birthday girl with a slice of cake lit with sparklers :)  To me, this is more of a tapas spot where you share most dishes rather than order your own individual meal. That being said, if you're super hungry, you'll have to order a bunch because the portions aren't huge. I'll definitely return, especially to enjoy the vibrant ambience. Next time I'll probably go to enjoy drinks and appetizers rather than a full dinner."}
{"text":"First time here, my daughter and I got to sample the new brunch menu on the house. We were seated upon arrival, and were given the new brunch menu. I ordered the enchiladas suiza, 2 hearty chicken enchiladas in green sauce for my entree. Also, ordered the pomegranate guacamole, black bean hummus, chefs assorted sushi rolls, wok fried breakfast potatoes, and a chorizo and egg scramble. For drinks, my daughter had a Bloody Mary, I ordered a passion fruit mimosas, and a blood orange mimosa. For desert, we shared the liquid cheesecake br√ªl√©e. Oh, my daughter ordered the coconut pancakes too. Needless to say, it was a lot of delicious food! The service was fantastic! Thanks again  Sumomaya!"}
{"text":"Made reservations through Open Table for Friday night at 7:45 pm and was very busy with people waiting. Drove up to complimentary valet parking. As we walked in there was at the counter a DJ playing his music and the receptionist just standing there where I did not know who she was or if she was there just to be seen.  The restaurant was very loud and a fun and excitement vibe. We checked in and were seated within a few minutes.  The service was very good and helpful as she explained the menu very thoroughly.  We decided to order the Korean Tacos, Chilean Sea Bass and the Lobster and Crab Dynamite. Although all the portions were like tapas the food was very good.  The Korean Tacos were the size of street tacos but were packed with meat and other condiments.  The Chilean Sea Bass was excellent and grill with the little bit of crispy skin. The portion was very small also but yummy.  The Lobster and Crab Dynamite was also very good and not as spicy as thought when described by our waitress.  This place is very Scottsdale to the tilt. Did not hear great things about the sushi so we passed on it tonight but next time we come back may give it a try.  Will come back but maybe for lunch."}
{"text":"My friends and I came back here again to try more cuisine. Sure enough, it was almost as good as the last time we came here. The owner visited each table and actually recognized us. He was very welcoming and we certainly enjoy coming here.   Service: due to the loud music, our waiter couldn't hear us multiple times. We repeated ourselves throughout the entire time we were there. Nevertheless, he tried his best to give us good services and it is certainly appreciated.   Food: I ordered the Mexican shrimp cocktail again. It is still delicious but unfortunately it was a bit sour this time. Yellowtail sashimi/sushi and Eel sushi were absolutely delicious. Their pork belly is juicy and the carrot cake light enough to give you just enough sweet at the end of the meal. Their cocktail drinks are amazing! GREEN \"MAGIC\" MOJITOwas what I had and I couldn't have enough of it  Rating: this is still my favorite restaurant in AZ. My only complain is how loud the music is. It makes it hard to talk with friends, but it is certainly a good place for a girls night out"}
