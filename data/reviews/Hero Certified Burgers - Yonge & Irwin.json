{"text":"I thought it was way to expensive for how it tasted.  I paid $33 for two chicken burgers and two poutines.  The chicken had a rubber texture and the poutine was okay at best.  There are a number of places in Toronto like Stampede Bison Grill that are much cheaper and less synthetic tasting."}
{"text":"I went on the hunt for a veggie burger and happily stumbled upon this place. It was definitely satisfying for my taste buds and my wallet, and the best part was that it was customizable given that you have a wide array of topping options. The soda dispenser was fascinating, touch-screen with a nice selection of pop, the fact that they had cherry-vanilla Pepsi kinda sealed the deal for me."}
{"text":"What's a Pro Burger?  Sorry we don't have that.  Skinny tateless burger, no sesame poppy buns as listed.  I asked the guy why the burger was burnt - tasted burnt.  It arrived too quick so I think it sat pre cooked and reheated.  The fries were soggy, and just warm, but were tasty.  I woke up in the middle of the night with a woozy stomach and threw up.  So much for this place - don't go there.  Walk further down Yonge street to 5 Guys for a better burger experience."}
{"text":"I got a burger and fries here. As an American, I think I'm qualified to judge the quality of burgers. I was also a little intoxicated, so my standard for good burgers was lower than usual. This burger was nasty. Patty was clear pre-frozen or precooked, and lacked any and all flavor. Blue cheese was clearly artificial and overpowering in flavor. Bacon was tasteless. Bun was dry and flavorless. Fries were greasy, flaccid, and under-salted. No soap in bathroom. This burger confirmed all my preconceived notions of Canada: a lower quality ripoff of American culture. Shame on this restaurant and Canada."}
{"text":"Not bad! I had the veggie (Sol patty) burger, on a whole what flatbread with a really tasty Chipotle sauce and assorted toppings. Combo with fries was about $10. Personally, beef is not my thing, but hero claims all of the good stuff with full transparency, hormone & antibiotic free meats. The salmon is labelled wild and alaskan, but there is NO mention of where the chicken or Turkey comes from or the quality of the meat.   There are gluten free burgers for my celiac friends.   The man taking our order must have been management, or at least very well trained. He was excellent at dealing with us, making sure everyone in line got their order started before he rang us through, and even came over to apologize when they (very monumentally) screwed up my order.    Me and the coworkers were all impressed with the quality. Solid Lunch, just give me info on the chicken and I'll be happy."}
{"text":"For whatever reason -- maybe it is the unhealthy stuff that gives burgers their flavour -- the burgers here are just bland. I still eat here from time to time but I have never craved a hero burger."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. They cancel Just Eat orders 2 minutes before the delivery time. Awful customer service.   I would not recommend this location at all. Messaged the store and didn't even get a response back."}
{"text":"Best burger I have ever had! So good! And so many options! The people were also SUPER nice! New fav place!"}
{"text":"It's supposed to be some gourmet, fancy, \"certified\" burger. It just looked and tasted like a really expensive hamburger to me; I could pay $4 and get something more filling and tastier. Just an expensive burger with nothing special about it.  I ordered a well-done burger. When they gave me a medium-rare one, I told them that I ordered well-done, to which they rudely insisted that I had not, implying that I'm a liar. I showed them the receipt, which clearly had a note added for a well-done burger. They gave me some disgusted, disapproving look, like I'm not entitled to what I ordered or something. Like, fuck off. If I wasn't so hungry I would've had to give them my lecture on how they're in the customer service business, and that rudeness isn't acceptable when it's their fault and not mine. Yeah this was at night, and everybody is a little cranky working at night. But they're still getting paid. They made me another burger, but that definitely isn't a substitute for treating your customer like an ass.   Overpriced food, rude staff."}
{"text":"Their Angus burger was okay. Nothing special to write home about, but their Turkey burger was downright dry, overcooked and DISGUSTING.  The only decent burger was the Chicken Breast one, but Wendy's does it better (ironic or what?)  I am not coming back here. It was bland, overpriced and totally not what I expected of a burger."}
{"text":"Crazy 8 ounce Burgers. They have this pretty cool Hero sauce. Good Onion Rings. Best Hallal meat in Toronto"}
{"text":"I'm not sure who's Hero this place is suppose to be but it's certainly not mine!  I have no idea why there are so many Hero Burger joints in the city. The food is just not that good.  They also keep trying to come up with creations that are just gross...Lobster burger?  Mexican hot dog?  Please focus on the core product which needs TLC.  The meat is dry, the bun is too thick, and the toppings are nothing special.  I'd honestly rather eat at McDonalds when it comes to value since this is not exactly a cheap joint either.  The only decent thing I tried was the chicken sandwich and sweet potato fries but that's not enough to save this place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff! He recommended us Lobster Burger Combo for 11.99 each. Unfortunately, the salty lobster ruined the burger. The beef patty is not so fresh as well. I though I was eating a McDonald's burger rather than a 9-dollar burger. OK"}
{"text":"This is the best hero burger simply because it is the only Hero location that flame broils.  I'm not sure what the complaints are about.  It is fast food, not white glove, the high price is for the lack of antibiotics, growth hormones, grain fed (most likely GMO, grass fed is better) and fully traceable (they try). All this is important to the quality of the food and why the price is so high. Support them and others will follow. If you really feel they are not meeting your expectations, let them know, but don't stop supporting them.  This is a giant step forward for healthier, not so bad, fast food.  I like this place for the effort to raise the bar and set a new standard for measuring quality. Now raise it a bit higher and have grass fed."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday at 2am on the busy week end of pride. The small place was pack. They didn't had anymore fries lol i guess it happen. Those 2 poor kids are working very hard. I took a oignons rings and it was great. My friend took a burger and it look so delicious!"}
{"text":"What a difference good management makes.  I've been to sit down restaurants that offered worse service than this Hero Burger location that's just opened up at Yonge and Irwin street.  We were greeted by the manager, who happened to be standing at the door and he followed us inside to take our order.  He was friendly and efficient, taking our orders carefully so that the person he was training could observe what he said and did.  He apologized, saying that he was training someone, but far from bugging us, it just highlighted his attention to detail.    The food was actually excellent.  We each ordered a veggie burger combo (one with sweet potato fries and one with regular).  Malt vinegar was available, a bonus as far as we were concerned.  The burgers were delicious - I was especially happy about the high quality sesame bun that had a chewy texture so different from the standard air you get at most fast food places.  The fries were also great - sweet potato fries crisp and a good balance of sweet/salt.  Regular fries dense with a solid earthy flavour.  No doubt about it, we were eating real - not over-processed - food.    There is seating outside that is well maintained and even the bathrooms were clean.    The manager actually came out to check on us in the middle of our meal to see how we were enjoying the food.  How often does that happen at a burger place?  All in all, A for this location of Hero Burger.  We'll be back.  Vegetarian Score: 7/10.  There is only one veggie item - the veggie burger - but that's still a sixth of the menu.  Plus, the veggie burger is quite good and the toppings are fresh.  No complaints here."}
{"text":"Bottom line: a little pricy for what it is, but tasty and quality food.   I have to say I really disagree about all the bad reviews. I am gluten free and they have a pretty good gluten free bun. The meat isn't the best but it's waaaaaay better than McDonalds. Not to mention not filled with all the poisonous chemicals McDonalds has. I got the hero burger with fries and the fries are pretty good and the ingredients taste pretty fresh."}
{"text":"Decent burgers with a wide variety of toppings, much wider than the average fast food burger place: cranberry sauce, zucchini relish, fire roasted peppers etc. Middle of the road fries, and a freestyle coke machine (when it's working)."}
{"text":"Terrible.   The staff was extremely unfriendly and unhelpful. They were out of 4 oz burgers, pickles, and their pop machine had no CO2 so nothing was carbonated. They did not tell us about the pop machine and when we questioned them they were curt, unapologetic and did not offer any compensation.   The employees were just the worst."}
{"text":"No horse meat as far as I know.  So yum!"}
{"text":"First time trying Hero Burger, and the service staff is so rude and unprofessional. The burger was good, but the cashier did not seem to care about me and rushed me during my order when I was telling him through condiments to put on my burger. He was sitting there on his cell phone and was uninterested in anything around him. My visit was around 9:30pm tonight."}
{"text":"The service was fast here. I got a Heavy Hitter burger (two 4 oz beef patties) with fries. It tasted good, but I wouldn't say it's anything too special!"}
{"text":"for the amount this butger was and for the sacrifice of calories....this locations burger was subpar.  i dont eat burgers alot but sometimes i treat myself and well....what can i say...not impressed and a tad disapointed.   these days its so hard to find a great meaty burger cooked to perfection.  the quality of meat has gone down....and i expected more of this franchise.  maybe its just this location.    oh well."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple times and my opinion has improved a bit. I've never touched the nasty turkey again but the beef burger is pretty ok. It's a lot like the Harvey's patty. I haven't had it overcooked yet, it's been a pretty consistent product. The drink machine produces Fanta Zero which is a nice change from my usual Coke Zero. There is a blizzard/mcflurry rip off called a Zipp which is edible and fairly cheap and they have coffee crisp bits. The price is still ridiculous. In honesty, it's just a processed hamburger, it doesn't need to cost more than $5. I paid $9 the other day. The prices are borderline psychotic."}
{"text":"This place is great for being drunk and getting some noms, which is exactly what we did on Saturday Night.  I think I got the basic hero with all the free toppings, and a combo. I remember that the burger was really sauced up, and I couldn;t even finish it, let alone touch my fries!  As well, I had some of the ice cream..which was a horrible idea considering how lactose intolerant I am..but it was delicious.  Definitely post bar noms worthy!"}
{"text":"Expensive but tasty. I wouldn't pay 14 dollars for a hero burger combo on a regular basis but it was quality burger. But damn keep the price little down."}
{"text":"If you have a craving for a fast food burger, please please make it this place.  It's obviously can't compare to some of the other gourmet burger places in town, but compared to the major burger chains, Hero blows them away.  They have a decent selection of burger staples and a few odd and quirky burgers like the soy, bison, or turkey.  Throw in your choice of bun, condiments and veggies, and you can get a decent fast food burger.  Definitely the type of restaurant I avoid these days, but a quality fast food place considering your other options."}
{"text":"Burger was good, fries were not fresh and service was horrible.   There was a customer ahead of me that the cashier was dealing with. When he was done with the customer, he went to do something else and didn't even say anything to me. No \"I'll be with you shortly\" or whatsoever.   As I was placing the order, I got the 4oz burger combo (it was advertised as 7.99 at the entrance) but when I was about to pay i came up to $9 something so I confronted the cashier. And he was like \"oh you wanted the promotion?\" Uhm.....okay?  Idk if that's his sneaky part of charging me more or he's just ignorant. Anyhow, he changed the price on the screen but not the debit/credit machine. Again had I not seen carefully before tapping my card, I would've paid $10.15. Ugh!  After 5 mins or so waiting for my food I went home opened up my burger and fries, omg the fries were dark brown! Idk how many times they've reused the oil to fry the fries. Nightmare didn't just end there. Diarrhea struck!   I now rmbr why I don't go to Hero coz my experience in every location hasn't been pleasant."}
{"text":"Uhhh, this is suppose to be a gourmet hamburger place. The hamburger itself was bland, no real true flavor. It gets two stars only because they do have a large variety of condiments to choose from, beyond the typical mayo, mustard, lettuce, etc. Also, the hand-cut fries were really good; but after all those added condiments, the burger still tasted like soft paper - lol. Different, but not a place I would be running back to the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Don't know what the fuss is, at best it's not bad. You won't hate it, you won't love it. Ho Hum."}
{"text":"If you like good burgers- never go there. Seriously. Worst 8$ burger ever. Patty was burned and 1 (ONE) sliced pickle"}
{"text":"Nice little location in the heart of the city. It's a chain so the food is consistent and delicious. The sit-in part of the restaurant is pretty small, but can probably accommodate about 15 people, which isn't bad considering the location. The staff were nice, quick and efficient. No line up and the food came in the standard 5-7 minutes.  I really enjoy the gluten free bun that they have here and appreciate that there is a list of toppings that are gluten free rather than having to guess at what sounds like it might have gluten.  I really liked this location and would probably visit it more if it wasn't so far from me. Definitely a good place to visit if you don't want an actual restaurant but don't want real fast food (like Burger King, mcdonalds, etc). The prices are a little high, but you get what you pay for!"}
{"text":"So this was my first time ever.  It was AMAZING but got 4 stars cause it was a bit burnt.  Combo signature burger ran me 12-14 dollars can't remember.  It was GOOD though :) Fries are so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Come here for a 3 star burger and a terrible venue.   Burger is OK. I had the grilled chicken burger with Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, ketchup and mustard and a bit of mayo. The fries were OK as well, slightly over salted. Meh. 3 star meal, but the venue brought the overall rating down two notches.  The manager, who was seen smoking outside was also seen preparing out foods - without washing his hands. The kitchen looked filthy and could be considered a rat's nest. The fume hood wasn't working properly and so the whole restaurant was smokey. Signs are crooked, floors are sticky, the worst burger bar in Toronto.  Sorry, won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Employees were extremely rude. They do not accept any promotions that are advertised on their website."}
{"text":"It was the only burger joint open past 10 P.M on a Saturday (in December 2014...this review has been updated). One Blue Moon Burger combo within Yonge Street which was really surprising!  One Blue Moon Burger (guessed it, it has blue cheese and I think I added bacon to it, served with fries and a Vanilla Barqs Root Beer. Patty was succulent but none could compare to the double-banquet burger and the juiciness of it.   $25 for a 8oz double patties ain't bad if you share the fries and drink. Won't be disappointed except for price.  MENU PDF: http://www.heroburgers.com/pdf/HERO-menu.pdf"}
