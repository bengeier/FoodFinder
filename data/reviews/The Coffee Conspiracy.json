{"text":"I went to this coffee shop last week with a frnd based on Yelp reviews...I had a caffe latte and it was Superb !! I luved the flavor...Also there are a lot of interesting art work for display rangin from jewellery to origamy...Unique place and so i luved it :-)"}
{"text":"Good Toddy brewed iced coffee serving Cartel beans out of Tempe, AZ. Hipster vibe, laid back, slightly grungy. Seemed out of place in Phoenix, but every major city deserves good coffee, right?"}
{"text":"Dropped in here with some friends after we left Bar Smith... CUTE place! Food was incredible! Now how many places can you say that about at 2am?  Great vibe from the place... definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Water, water, every where, Nor any drop to drink. There are 5 Starbucks within a 3 block radius of my work. Yet I am dying for a really good cup of coffee.  Earlier this week, I was feeling particularly antsy. I could see the sun shining outside my office window, and my booty had grown numb, planted in my office chair for four hours straight. Field trip!  I did a quick Yelp search to find the closest indie coffee joints, and Conspiracy came up, at .7 miles away. Ulgh, a 1.4 mile round trip walk.   But I went for it, and boy howdy am I glad I did! I was served possibly the best latte of my life. The espresso was layered with different tones and flavors. The froth was nice and dense, and even adorned with a lil frilly foo foo. I couldn't even bring myself to sully it with fake sweetener. It had to be real deal sugar. So. Good.  Sadly, I don't think I can make this trek often. But I will make a point of stopping in from time to time for a hit of the good stuff. In between, I'll be cast adrift in a sea of corporate coffee."}
{"text":"Two words, iced mocha. They do it like your momma did pancakes. Well not like my momma, because that would be black and dry, and that just wouldn't make sense here at all.  Seriously, this has become my favorite coffee destination for the past half a year or so. I'm obviously a fan of the iced mocha but the hot beverages are just as tasty. The owner John, is always great to talk to and really inviting to anyone who steps in the door. The other baristas are very nice as well. Oh and the prices are really affordable. Which means more money to buy some of the cool things in the store with.  The shop is a co-op for artists to sell there goods so while you're waiting for your coffee there is plenty to have a look at.  It's a hard to find because it's right smack in the middle of an old historic area but well worth the search. There's not a lot of places to sit and seems more of a place to grab and go or grab and shop. Not really a watch me as I work sort of establishment (ala Starbucks).  Side note: The place is nuts during First Friday being that it's right smack in the heart of the art walk so be warned."}
{"text":"Small, unique vegan sandwich/wrap cafe with a ton of character. Art inside and out and even a skate ramp in the back. Nathan was working and was very helpful and great to talk to. I liked that this place was unpretentious and had personality. It's the kind of thing Phoenix lacks."}
{"text":"Super cool!  I had a mocha and it was excellent.  There's a great vibe and they sell cool, local kitschy art and wearables."}
{"text":"If you want excellent coffee, an interesting but off the wall conversation that is completely politically incorrect, and a great time with interesting knick-nacks to buy, this is your place.  John Sagasta, the Owner formerly of Sagasta Coffee, is a great barista and can talk about anything.  Bring your taste buds and an open mind and you'll have fun no matter what!"}
{"text":"Cool downtown arts vibe. excellent coffee and vegan donuts! What's not to like?"}
{"text":"This is the coffee place located inside Conspire. John, the owner and barista, is super friendly, knows a lot about the area, and makes a great cup of coffee on top of it all. The Chai Latte is superfantastic too. He actually makes it from scratch, mixing all the ingredients. It's not the regular store-bought or normal coffeehouse stuff. It could maybe have a bit less nutmeg though."}
{"text":"I've been to this place only when art walk takes place. I get lost in their \"library\" of conspiracy literature. Coffee is good, but with so many people bouncing into you, makes it no fun.  Will have to return when it is a regular day."}
{"text":"*They are moving to the old HoodRide location soon!* Which will be a FULL coffee house with outdoor and indoor seating!  The owner John couldn't be nicer ... the coffee just rawks (it has a very full earthy flavor) ... He buys from Cartel Coffee but instead of telling customers what THEY want (as Cartel does) John makes it how YOU want it without the Douchebag \"WE know REAL coffee and you don't\" attitude."}
{"text":"great coffee shop! Has really great art every time I go there by different local artists.. and great baked goods! Loacally owned with great service! If you're ever in Phoenix and want good coffee, go and support this place!"}
{"text":"Five Stars For Sure, This location has all the elements that do not allow room to lose a star.  Vegan Donuts! comfortable seats and atmosphere along with a great cup of coffee will always earn the respect of any customer.  I had a bagel sandwich  Mexijewnini, is the name, It is simply over the top, melted cheese, spinach, Pico and cream cheese, toasted please.  Along with the local coffee house feel, clothing jewelery and books are also available for sale.   Find this small location on First Fridays as well."}
{"text":"If we work together and stay focused we can help small independent coffee houses like this one overthrow the oppressive Starbucks dictatorship.    We can do it.  Drive the extra mile to go to an indy coffee house.  Yell derisive things like \"Lemurs!\" out the window as you cruise past Starbucks.  Watch out for upstart Dunkin' Donuts as well.  The name is a misnomer, they are really in it for the coffee, not the donuts.  I know deep in their heart they hope to rise from a petty potentate and usurp the throne.  Overall I liked The Coffee Conspiracy with it's hipster atmosphere and so-laid-back-it's-almost-prone vibe.  And the coffee was good.  Nothing else matters to me about a coffee house if they can't make good coffee."}
{"text":"Amazing coffee great tea awesome people great music nice jewelry"}
{"text":"The antithesis of Starbucks...independent coffee shop at its finest.  Bungalow with slacker types on Macs, board games, and dudes with dreadlocks on their fourth quadruple espresso latte for the day (and it is only 1:30 p.m.).  Americano was unbelievably smooth, made me swear off corporate coffee for almost a week (until I had no choice)."}
{"text":"One Man, One Espresso Machine, A Lot of Love and a great cup of coffee!"}
