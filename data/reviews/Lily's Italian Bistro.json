{"text":"I have been there three times now and each time I have ordered something different, so far there is nothing to complain about!!! The food is excellent and service is prompt."}
{"text":"I wish I could give such a review as the others. It really pains me that I can't.  Was looking so forward to a date night with another couple at something a little high end.  Not from this area originally.  I'm finding it harder and harder to find quality food in this area.  And originally being highly trained in the wait staff position I find this complete training to be lacking as well.  Definitely excited by the menu options and finding it very hard to choose between lots I was wanting to taste our waitress was very uninformed by the menu.  She had no idea about the appetizers when asked for ideas.  She didn't know the different pasta choices.  And worst she got my order wrong even when I pointed and repeated.  Ugh.  Well I'm still pulled to try again since I do want it to suceed cause I love me some date night.  Get it together."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Lobster Mac n cheese was awesome and the meatballs are to die for !!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. We were in town for one night and stumbled across it for dinner. The staff were super friendly and the food is delicious. The trout and the Oso bucu were excellent. They also have an impressive wine list for a little restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped here after a hike in the Crowders State Park   Food was delicious!  Prices are great and the quality of food is top notch. We had chicken caesar salad - delicious, a steak wedge salad - delicious, and a chicken sandwich, everything was awesome. My sweet tea was topped off often and the staff was very friendly. We were just passing through but would love this gem at home. If you're in the area, definitely stop in for a meal."}
{"text":"I was visiting family and they gave us a few options of restaurants to try.  It was decided to try Lily's.  Service was great! Immediately after getting seated they asked us about drinks which we ordered a bottle of Chianti.  Started of with a bowl of pasta e fagioli soup which was the best I have ever had. I am still craving a bowl 3 days later and wish I could make it at home.   I ordered the salmon and it was delicious! The risotto was cheesy but not too much and it paired well with the corn succotash. My husband had the chicken (not sure what it was called) and he loved it as well.   I will be back next time I am in Gastonia. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow ... great good, great staff ..... give them a try. You will not be disappointed. The osso buco is to die for. Downtown Gastonia is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Have eaten there twice. Most excellent!  Fresh. Seasoned perfectly. Will return again and again. I loved the food. The ambience is nice also."}
{"text":"Fantastic!- Service. Atmosphere and food. Tanya, our server, was super sweet and professional and even helped us surprise my mom. I had the tagliatelle and calamari and Caesar- All were exceptional. Cj, the bar tender was super accommodating and polite and the manager saw us off with gratitude and a handshake which is super awesome.   Excellent high end dining option. Will visit again soon."}
{"text":"Food Outstanding & innovative, friendly and attentive servers, historic/trendy/kitschy decor, great drink list and outdoor patio dining. What more could you want? I predict great things for Lily's in Gastonia."}
{"text":"Loved, loved, LOVED. Did you read my previous review of Milanos? (*shudder*) Well, Lily's in downtown G-town is the absolute opposite. This place is a foodie's wet dream. They have amazing pastas and authentic dishes that are a joy to look at and eat. Housemade gelato? Tiramisu? Ohhh yeahhhhh... the service is funny, friendly and attentive. If you love great Italian food, you can't lose at Lily's."}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous portions and attentive staff are a few of the highlights. The appetizer special of a shrimp and crabmeat martini was divine. The description mentioned a spicy sauce but it was flavorful not hot - perfect for our group.   The waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave a wonderful wine recommendation. We were disappointed that salads do not come with the entrees but the salad we ordered was huge - big enough to split and the entrees were enough for two as well. The napoleon creme brûlée is a must try. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"So happy to see this restaurant pop up in downtown Gastonia, finally something else I can walk to from work that isn't Mexican or bar food. The food was amazing!! The only negative was that they could of probably used another server on the floor, it took me 15 minutes after I finished eating to get my check."}
{"text":"Arranged for our Dinner Group to enjoy...well, not so much.  Checked it out and thought it was good, and used previous reviews.  Made a reservation 10 days in advance and called to confirm the day of reservation.  Everyone arrived on time and went to table on schedule.  Service was poor.  We had drinks from earlier, but food service was slow.  We were seated at 6:30 pm and finished at 9:30.  Half of of our diners got the entree and then 30 minutes later, the other half received theirs.  When questioned, the server said that they like everyone to be served at once...didn't work.  My friend had a glass of water literally spilled on him at beginning of meal by server and all he got was 6 extra napkins.   Food was Ok, but it was embarrassing to bring a group of people here to show off the area. Gastonia is doing a lot to revitalize,  but maybe this restaurant needs to work on some things ."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about Lily's!  The grilled caesar salad was the best salad I've EVER had.  I've tried the chicken scarpriello, spaghetti and meatballs, and omg, the shrimp and grits.  Still on my list of things to try is the spare ribs, steak and pizza so I'll definitely be back.  I like the fact that there are specials too, that aren't normally on the menu.  Just makes my decision harder in the end though!  Fantastic restaurant!!"}
{"text":"A welcome improvement to the dining choices in Gastonia. The decor is a bit off, the walls are painted a cheery shade of Tuscan yellow with random swipes of Tuscan red. I understand the intent, but the swipes look like an unhappy accident. The artwork doesn't seem to mesh either.   Regardless of the eclectic decor, if you are seeking freshly prepared tasty italian food and a nice glass of wine in Gastonia...this is the place to be at the moment.  Fine dining, non-chain choices are slim in Gastonia so I hope Lily's does well."}
{"text":"Very friendly and accommodating wait staff. Food portions were perfect and despite other negative comments I have read, I believe the food is a great value! They put a little different flare to their menu which sets them apart from other Italian bistros. I will definitely be coming back on my next trip to Gastonia."}
{"text":"Lily's is worth getting to to dine from anywhere in the World. No exaggeration!!  The sauce, the pasta, the meatball, the seafood is the best we've had.  This is seriously fresh and perfectly prepared dishes."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to step out for a date night. It was Saturday night and we entered the restaurant at 6:50 PM. We did not have a reservation and were told the next available table would be 8 PM or we could sit at the bar. We decided to take the bar seating and so glad we did. The bartender was such a nice man and an amazing server. We started off with a prosciutto and mozzarella app thinking it was more of a salad presentation. Instead three little fried dough balls were presented to us. Good but not great. My husband ordered the filet which was cooked perfectly and delicious however the mashed potatoes it was served on were dry, cold and lumpy. I ordered the chicken scarpriello and thought it covered all bases!  Sweet peppers, savory chicken, spicy sausage, greens and a sauce that I made me want to lick my plate.  Lily's is such a nice restaurant choice in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"This place has everything going for it! The food is amazing. You can walk inside and grab a glass of wine while you wait, and you can feel the energy from the chef as he prepares meals. Once the plates are ready, the display is expertly critiqued by the expo, and then served to the table. Having waited tables for several years, I have become quite the critic. Hannah has been our server twice, and each time she has been nothing short of excellent.   The really great thing that you will see here, is that this team truly works together in every aspect. You will see the manager running food, grabbing plates, bringing drinks (Hannah said his name was Win), it shows phenomenal character and work ethic, and that alone would bring me back. To the owner of this restaurant, BRAVO, you have figured it out."}
{"text":"After a day hiking at Crowders, the family stopped in Gastonia to find an place to eat.  Came across Lily's.   Great food, service, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really like this place..  The food and wine are superb!  The service has been fabulous.  Like the atmosphere, esp the outside area on a nice day.  Very nice and welcoming people.  It's nice that it's next to the new Sleepy Poet to do a little shopping while in the area.. that street has so much potential - I hope they will build it up a bit more in the near future."}
{"text":"Service was great..food was delicious. Will be back again..reminds me of a NYC restaurant...hidden gem in Gastonia"}
{"text":"I was referred here by a friend of mine who knew the chef. Boy, was I in for a treat!  My friend and I got there around 7. The place was already packed -- which I took to be a good sign! I was told to tell the hostess that the \"foodies\" we're there. She was a little confused, but happy to do it! We waited at the bar until it was time to be seated.  I had a glass of -- hands down -- the most delicious wine I've ever had. It was a red, but unfortunately I can't remember the name of it. You can't just a glass of all their wines, so it's a good idea to take a look on their website before you go if you're like me and need a minute (or ten!) to figure out what you want.   Once we were seated at a table (it was about a 25-30 minute wait) our waitress was attentive and VERY knowledgeable about the menu. She was happy to answer questions. I ordered the Tagliatelle Amatriciana.  Just... wow. I am not a \"pasta\" person. But this was incredible. Just a little bit of a kick to it -- enough to give it flavor. The sauce was so tasty. I was very pleased.   My friend and I split a creme brûlée for dessert. Wow. They do not do creme brûlée the regular way. It's layered, drizzled with chocolate and fruit sauce, and decorated with blueberries and strawberries. I was glad I split it with my friend!  All in all it was a great trip, and well worth the short wait before our meal. I definitely plan to go back if I'm ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"One only because I can't go lower.  Worst restaurant experience I've ever had.  One hour of poor service only to be given raw chicken.  Manager and waiter did not apologize or credit bill.  Waiter was terrible and did not care.  We had a great experience on our first visit but will never ever go back!!!"}
{"text":"good food. nice atmosphere. REASONable prices. will go back soon."}
{"text":"We made reservations for an early Valentine dinner to beat the weekend crowd.  The presentation was beautiful (I had rigatoni with Parmesan cream sauce; my husband had the osso bucco).  The food was outstanding.  The service was impeccable.  Great locally owned restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went for date night with the wife. The food was delicious and service friendly. Nice place for s casual night out. The homemade desserts were delicious."}
{"text":"Potential = 5 ***** Reality = 3 ***  Oh how Lily's has potential!!  A great bistro location including outside quaint tables.  The inside decor totally fits the Italian or NY bistro vibe.  The menu goes well beyond the typical Italians restaurants spattered throughout the South, with definite signs of creativity and ancestry.  But that where the 5* stops.  We arrived on time after calling for a reservation with our party of 5 to find there were no tables available.  After a some time a booth opened and was offered placing one of our guests smack in the middle of the main aisle.  While waiting for the booth to be set up we ordered cocktails.  Sorry but a mojito is not made with Gin!  A negroni, which is on the specialty cocktail list, is not served in a tall glass, has a couple of dashes of bitters and a burnt orange peel.  All sangria, red or white, is served chilled and/or over ice.  For the food, the menu offered tremendous promise.  However, the butternut squash soup was overly sweet, almost caramel burnt like.  The calamari came out tepid at best, in a conjoined clump.   The caprese salad looked great but it obviously was the wrong time of year for tomatoes.  The entrees were good but just missing the extra something or in the case of the fish special had too much something, salt.  It was almost uneatable.  The others were either over salted or under seasoned.  I hope this was a bad night because the area so needs a place exactly like Lily's has the potential to be."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food and atmosphere. However, the service was terrible. For that price point, we expected a lot more.  We may give it another shot in the future considering the food quality. We'll see."}
{"text":"E quasi ora! (It's about time!).  We've been in need of some fresh choices for local cuisine.  Though the bistro has been open since July, we finally made our first visit this past weekend.  We made up time by sampling (7) different items, starting with the appetizers and ending with desserts & complemented everything with (2) bottles of wines.  Very reasonable prices and selections.  Food was fresh and service was attentive.  Pleasant patio and interior atmosphere.  I only wish that the appetizers had been warmer -- but still tasty!  We're looking forward to more visits, perhaps to even one of their wine dinners."}
{"text":"It was just ok. My wife really liked her tomato-based penne pasta dish. Two of us had the calzone. It was large, but bland.  The service was a little lacking. Our server had only been there a week. Our drink glasses emptied a couple of times without him noticing. When we asked for silverware, he forgot it.  The cheesecake was mediocre."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had lunch at this restaurant and really enjoyed the experience. The food was very good as was the service. If I had one complaint it would be that the restaurant is extremely loud. The restaurant was full and I found it difficult to have a conversation. With that being said, the noise would not be a reason for me not to return as the pros definitely outweigh the cons. This is a restaurant that I really hope will continue to receive local support and thrive in its current location."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. The calamari was great and the white pizza was awesome. We really enjoyed it and plan on going back."}
{"text":"Lily's is definitely not the kind of place you'd expect to find in Gastonia.  It's a breath of fresh air in a town with limited fine dining choices. The first thing you should know is that if you want to come on a Friday or Saturday night (aka prime time) is that you should probably make a reservation. They do have outdoor seating but obviously in winter it is unusable space for diners.  It's a pretty cute and inviting space. Nice sized tables with elbow room and bistro feel with white tablecloths. The only decorative aspect I didn't like were the red paint strokes on the walls everywhere - although some might say \"creative flair\", it felt more like \"crime scene\" or an afterthought.  When you walk in, there's a small bar to the left which was filled with diners and unfortunately not really any other waiting area around the hostess station. This part of the restaurant seems to get bottlenecked pretty easily. We arrived 10 to 15 minutes before our reservation and were lucky enough to be seated early.  The wine menu was fairly impressive and I was able to find a Montepulciano D'Abruzzo for only $23. For starters, we had the diver scallops seared and served on risotto and the PEI Mussels with bacon in white wine. The risotto had a nice al dente texture and the sauce the mussels were cooked in was delicious. The Chicken Scarpriello was a four star dish. The chicken was moist and I loved the combo of pepperdew peppers, potatoes, sausage , and Swiss chard, all pulled together in a rich brown sauce; very hearty and a great dish for a cold evening. The Penne with artichokes was unimpressive. Something was lacking. The dish was just too light and plain, which is weird considering it had capers, Kalamata olives, artichokes , roasted peppers and lemon - it was also very watery. A two star dish.  There are definitely enough choices on the menu to find something that appeals to you. Service is really attentive, patient and helpful."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Best Italian in our vicinity! A little on the pricy side but worth the money if authentic Italian food is what your looking for. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. I have never had a bad meal. I want to highlight how fantastic it is that they have started serving brunch on Sunday afternoons. Great mimosas and amazing food to match. I had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was fluffy and golden brown. The chicken breast had a pecan breading and there was plenty of maple syrup. My boyfriend had an Italian baked egg dish. It was fabulous and was served with a side of fresh fruit. I will come back for this experience.   Their dinner selections is phenomenal. I have never had a bad meal and it feels like I have tried half their menu. They have the classics nailed such as spaghetti and meatballs. But they also have other amazing pasta dishes. It's hard to recommend one meal because they have all been great. Every time I go I get the calamari appetizer because it is a generous portion size and always executed perfectly. They have a great wine selection and offer many unique cocktails. The atmosphere is comfortable and I love the outdoor seating during the summer months."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today... Food was great. We had the grilled chicken  with avocado on  ciabatta bread with sweet potato fries. Had a very nice waitress.  Very kind and informative..  Will be going back for dinner.  The dinner menu looks great..  Can't go wrong with this restaurant.  Very clean and professional."}
{"text":"This was a first visit so I had my mind wide open.  The atmosphere was great, comfortable, and no wait.  The server was attentive.  Now onto the food.  I had a salmon and crab cake that was tasty, but you only get two, so a little pricey at $10.  I then had the shrimp grits.  I eat this dish every where I go so I've had all types, some bad and some good.  The very best I've had was at Roosters near Southpark.  This one was number two and very good with nice plump shrimp, sausage and a creamy corn sauce.  It could use a little more heat, but overall very good.  A little pricey though.  No dessert tonight, maybe next time.  My wife tried a trout dish that she said was possibly the best fish dish she had ever had.  That says a lot because she eats fish about every day.  This place is very good, but damn, a meal for two, appetizer, entrees, no dessert, three glasses of wine, tip, cost $100!  The whole time I kept trying to convince myself I was in Belmont or Charlotte, not Gastonia.  To be fair, they pulled it off well.  I'll be back.  PS. Get rid of the paper tablecloth covers.  I don't want to spend $100 on a meal and eat on a paper tablecloth."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Had the Crab cake wrap.. AWESOME!!! Price was fair, very clean, friendly staff!! This is one of my new fav spots for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Drove through Gastonia during a trip and saw the Yelp reviews for this place and decided to stop by for dinner. I'm so glad that we did. The baby spinach salad was delicious; the dressing was light, sweet and didn't overpower the taste of the beets, berries, and other natural flavors. The calzone was delicious and the sauce on the side was very fresh. They grated fresh Parmesan onto the food and that as very nice and tasty. We also ordered the potato herb pizza and that was unbelievable. The cheese to sauce ratio was perfect and it was full of flavor!  For dessert we had the Italian style cheesecake, it was moist and fluffy as opposed to the traditional New York cheesecakes that are rich and creamy. It was decent.  Server was very nice and the atmosphere of this restaurant was very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Food was ok. The chicken with penne and Gorgonzola sauce was quite bland and could have used salt, capers and more olives. My server was efficient and attentive but her incorrect/correction of my pronunciation of a few things was rude and offensive. I've traveled to Italy and have extensive knowledge of Italian food and found that the server had poor judgement when correcting me."}
{"text":"5th star! Daily specials are out of this world. Always always ask for the daily specials. AND with the addition of wine pairing dinners and participation in Charlotte Restaurant week, this place is here to stay!"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Lily's for the first time last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. Overall, our food was pretty good, but like all Italian restaurants, the food is overpriced considering the cost of making it. (After all, pasta is inexpensive, and the proteins in our meals were small in portion and of the less expensive variety--chicken and ground beef/sausage, rather than steak or seafood.)   Positives: Our server was attentive and friendly. She kept our glasses full and brought us several refills on the free bread appetizer (which was great, since a party of 9 on a Saturday night can expect to wait a while). Fresh ground cheese and black pepper when the food was served. My meal (penne with chicken, vegetables, and a white wine cream sauce) tasted pretty good. Most others in the party seemed pleased with the taste of their food as well.   Negatives: The price.  My husband and I ordered pasta dishes and water to drink (no alcohol, appetizers, or dessert), and our meal came to $38 before tip. (Another couple's meal plus a few beers came up to $90.) My penne had only a few small pieces of chicken (under 2 ounces) and was really light on the vegetables too--mostly pasta and sauce, hardly worth $19. My husband's spaghetti was disappointing--overcooked noodles (soggy, mushy, and tasteless), an unbalanced marinara sauce (very acidic with no depth of flavor), and two very large meatballs that seemed under-seasoned. One of our party ordered a margherita pizza which, though tasty, was cold when it came out. We saw part of our group's food sitting on a counter (not under a warmer) for nearly 10 minutes, waiting for the other dishes to be finished. The wait is understandable, considering the size of the party, but it would have been preferable to bring the food out at different times if it couldn't be kept warm. It was also pretty loud; the walls and floors are all concrete, and the kitchen is open, so it's pretty noisy, and you almost have to shout to communicate.   Overall, the food was pleasant and service was good, but didn't live up to the price. We probably wouldn't go again, but we wouldn't discourage others from giving it a try if they can afford the price."}
{"text":"Wow Gastonia is impressing me here. Great Italian and comfortable outdoor dining. We've been for lunch and dinner and haven't been disappointed. The salad was fresh and low cal champagne vinaigrette dressing was great and didn't kill the salad. The waiter could've been a little faster since most of us only get an hour for lunch."}
{"text":"This was one of our favorite restaurants and we have had several exceptional visits. Tonight, however was not the case. Our server was wonderful and we have no qualms with her, but the food has changed from the original restaurant. First of all, our drinks were weak and watered down. The hot and dirty martini was nice but light. The Moscow Mule was basically Ginger beer and nothing else. The appetizers were good but the Mussels were supposed to come with bacon, tomato, Basil and white wine. The basil and white wine were there but not a sign of bacon or tomato. The crab and salmon cakes were okay, but the \"roasted corn\" was more similar to canned corn than roasted. Our Linguini Frutti Del Mare was about a pound of pasta to a small amount of frutti Del mare.  The dish lacked salt and spice. It was more about a lot of pasta and a little seafood in a bland tomato sauce. The Sea Bass was nice but overcome by the amount of salad with vinaigrette and canned corn. It was bland and unremarkable. Prices have gone up on all the entrees, but the quality has gone down. And how about a little Italian music rather than all the kitchen noise and din of all the other diners. It's about ambiance. Not sure if we will return. Not worth the money. Very sad because we tooted Lily's horn to a lot of people, but I would be reticent to recommend them now."}
{"text":"I love having this place in Gastonia !! It's a cute and comfy place that has good food and nice staff I've had the pasta fagioli soup. Very good home made and lots of flavor. Tomatoey  The spaghetti and meatballs are also homemade. Nice texture. Big The meat with cream sauce was my least favorite since I thought it lacked flavor The 1/2 size lunch pastas are still big. I still take home most of it They are used to take out. Include utensils Full bar. Lots of wine choices"}
{"text":"Elegant restaurant, but pricy for the food quality.  For a specialty food  place, the sauces should not taste as generic as opening a can, and the pasta should be freshly made.  It was an enjoyable meal, but entirely too pricey for the quality"}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of my local favorites, until our last visit, we asked to sit outside,the 1st table we could smell trash very stinky as if we were sitting next to it, our next seat was dark could not see the menu very well, but did see the roach run across table and up the wall, then they served the food, not the quality that we had known previously, very disappointing, after talking with waitress she said the chef they opened with was no longer there,and they hired his Su chef in his place.......BAD DECISION! Too Bad for us and them!"}
{"text":"I made a reservation for Thursday evening, but there were plenty of tables available when we arrived. Parking was easy on the street in front of the restaurant.  I ordered a rye, neat, but it came cold and watered down? I assume they must have shaken over ice before pouring in the glass. My friend had the house chianti. I ordered mussels and he ordered the chicken and sausage entree.  I did ask to not have the bacon on my mussels. It's important that I mention that as the mussels were flavorless. In a watery broth, there was nothing to add to the fact they were plain. I'm sure the bacon would have added something, but frankly I don't think it could have turned it into a great dish.  The chicken and sausage dish was confusing to me also. Rather heavy yet not any distinct flavor profile.  The after dinner coffee was very good.  Our server was just adorable and was attentive.  The food was just nothing worth coming back for, and rather pricey at that."}
{"text":"OMG!!! We had the Tagliatelle Amatriciana! It was fabulous! The romaine wedge was huge and tasty! Wine list is unique and wonderful! Had the chocolate bag with fruit for desert! Holy Cow!!! Yum!!! My friends dinners are salmon and fillet"}
{"text":"After receiving recommendations to try Lily's,  we finally decided to give it a shot today. We came just after the lunch rush when we knew they would'nt be busy. Our appetizer, the risotto balls were pretty bland and barely lukewarm in the center. One of our party ordered pasta with olives, capers, chicken, etc. It was good, but a little bland and certainly not extraordinary or anything special.  The others in our party ordered one of the daily specials,  the butternut squash ravioli. The ravioli and sauce were quite good, but one of us received only 4 ravioli and the other received 5 ravioli. It was not close to what I would consider a $10 lunch portion. It was appetizer sized and we left hungry. Other dinners appeared to have bread,  we never received any. We'll be having an early dinner as a result and I highly doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"For a long time, this place was very good...one of our favorites, in fact. But our most recent trip here was a complete disaster. We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and were told that we would have to wait half an hour or more, despite there being several open tables, because another party arrived late for their reservation. So we were being punished because someone else couldn't show up on time, and because the management here doesn't understand how to handle a reservation calendar. This was very inconvenient for us, as we were going to a concert immediately after dinner and didn't have all night to spend waiting in line at a restaurant. Which is why we made a reservation in the first place.   Once we were finally seated, we placed our order, and almost an hour went by without us receiving anything besides drinks. Every table near us was having the same problem, as several customers started getting irate and demanding answers from the management. It finally got to the point that we had to get up and leave or risk not making it to the concert. By that point, no one in our vicinity had received any food at all.   I contacted the restaurant via their Facebook page after this situation happened, but no one bothered to respond. It's a shame...they make excellent food, but poor management and their callous attitude towards us has caused us to decide not to return."}
{"text":"I would recommend this restaurant to regular diners and those who want to host a party at this venue.  We had a last minute request to the restaurant's owner to host a 90th birthday party.  The owner was more than accommodating.  He went over the menu with us, while treating us to a light lunch.  The food was outstanding.  The day of the function, the staff was there early enough to set up, prep and allow our DJ to enter the premises and set up.  During the party, the staff was very attentive and the food was outstanding!  Also, they had to go containers for guests to take food home with them.  Not many venues provide for this extra convenience! A++"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Italian food!! Calamari, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Rigatoni Bolognese among my favorites!"}
{"text":"I too wish I could give this place a better review. After being sat and brought water we ordered a few glasses of wine. They took about 20 minutes to get as the were \"short on glasses\". We then ordered our dinner and some starter salads. Waited over an hour before the salads came out. They were bee good though. Then when our entrees came out two of our 5 orders were wrong. We were not compensated anything for the meal. To top it off they only had one waitress who could run the alcohol so every table was waiting. The food is great but if the staff and management doesn't improve I will have a very hard time returning."}
{"text":"So far this is the best food in town! Fresh cooked with passion and the service is excellent! Here for business for a couple of days!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've always been impressed with the food when I've been here. My partner said this is the best steak he's had in town.   There's a lack of nicer dining options in Gastonia, and I think Lily's really filled that need. I also love that they set up shop downtown--they are really improving the neighbor!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best food in town! Wynn is awesome and makes for a very entertaining evening. We try something new every time we go and haven't been disappointed with how amazing it all tastes.  They have a huge wine list along with some great cocktails. Great ambiance whether you are sitting at the bar or under the lights outside.  Do not pass up going to this restaurant nestled in the heart of downtown. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch.  Service was a bit disorganized at first but pulled it together to create a great lunch experience. Food for all four of us was great. Fresh ingredients. Tiramisu dessert really good. Will go again."}
{"text":"Very nice place and the staff is super friendly. It doesn't hurt that the food is also great. Two big thumbs up."}
