{"text":"We ordered lunch from here at my work. All in all, we got seven sandwiches. Several of my coworkers got steak subs. They all said they were pretty good. The only real criticism is that the steak sandwiches come with lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise unless you request otherwise. This is pretty gross and none of those things belong on a steak sandwich. Also, the menu doesn't say what comes on the sandwiches so you might be in for an unpleasant surprise.

I got the tuna sub. The menu just said \"albacore tuna\", which it was. The tuna was good. Unfortunately, the tuna also had sweet relish in it. Pretty disgusting! Plus, there was hardly any of the tuna salad on the bread. There were eggs in the tuna salad, which was a nice touch, but like the steak sandwiches, none of this is mentioned on the menu. And the real irony here is the tuna doesn't come with lettuce or tomato....but steak sandwiches are. Is this place from Bizarro-Land or something?

What's good about this place? Well the bread's dynamite. Its definitely homemade or purchased from a bakery here in town. The bun's a foot long and bigger than a Subway bun.

They make homemade potato chips, which are delicious and crispy. Thick but still crispy and with just enough seasoned salt.

They're also super cheap. Most of their deli sandwiches are $4.99, which makes them cheaper than Subway...and of a better quality and larger. They don't have all the veggies that Subway does, or the variety. But if you want a tasty deli sub, this place is awesome.

Plus you can add a soda and homemade chips, fries or cole slaw for $2.00 extra. The chips are worth it.

All in all, this place is alright. I won't get the tuna again but I'd like to try some of their other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Like steak sandwiches .. And has a good beer selection a little pricey that's why the 4 stars.."}
{"text":"I always order a 2 foot ultimate cheese steak, but they removed it from the menu.  I ordered a 2 foot italian today, and my son went to pick it up, and it wasn't baked???  They aren't allowed to bake them anymore per the owner???  I would have ordered it with the lettuce tomato and onion on the side if someone would have told me so I could bake it myself.  They also changed the fries.  We've been ordering from them for years.  This is ridiculous.  Very unhappy.  I would have ordered from Niki's in West End.  I want to contact the owner.  I wonder it it's a new owner."}
{"text":"I'm not to sure why I got a salad from a sub place... Oh yea I'm on a diet. Anyways I got a chicken salad and asked for my fries and cheese on the side. They put everything on the salad anyways but I didn't want to wait any long to fix it or risk them messing with my food. 

I did have a few fries and they were good. The salad was a waste. My coworkers cheesesteak did look really good. Next time I'll have to try a cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Sandwiches and fries are top notch for me. I ordered the chicken sandwich. And they chopped it up philly style instead of a slab of chicken breast. And the fries were great as well! My only setback was the wine. They now sell wine there. I purchased 2 apothic red blends there. And I know what they taste like. And this was horrible, both bottles. It was thick and syrup tasting. I don't know if they received a bad batch or what. I don't think this is something that should totally fall on them. But they should speak with their distributor. 
Otherwise, I like their food and options of it. But probably won't buy wine from there again."}
{"text":"I spent a couple of years during my childhood living in McKeesRocks and this is just the sort of place you'd expect to find. I've been there a couple of times over the past few years and I have to say it's always been a good experience.
The sandwiches are fresh and tasty and they have a decent suds selection."}
{"text":"I've never yet to discover a place like this. They have delicious subs, salads also sell vine, beer and even alcohol slushy like whaaaaat??!? Definitely a check out place. 
PS a very clean environment."}
