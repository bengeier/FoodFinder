{"text":"Yet another new Indian restaurant? 

Downtown Urbana needs a place like this so I am excited to see Sitara opening up in the former Embassy place. The space has tons of potential. Embassy used to have live music, so maybe the new owners would be open to that. An Indian restaurant with live Jazz music? Why not -- now that's unique and different than your average Indian restaurant. 

The food was ok. Nothing spectacular.  I would probably go back if I have some craving and don't feel like cooking at home. We tried a lamb dish with Kashmiri naan. It was well cooked. Service can be improved a lot. They seem to be have too may servers but not enough coordination. 

I think what this town needs is an Indian restaurant similar to what Maize is doing for Mexican food -- fresh, creative, interesting food that you can't find anywhere else. 

I hope Sitara does something different and creative with the food and the space there rather than being just another Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Solidly good Indian fare. Went with a group and had the huge booth in the back. Good ambiance. Friendly servers. Good selection of 'ethnic' beers. Friends got the Flying Horse Royal Lager which was pretty awesome (light). All the apps and breads were tasty. My chicken korma was great. Was totally full, but still squeezed in some mango and pistachio ice cream. 

Certain to be my Chambana Indian restaurant for both in-house and take-out."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with Sitara. It came highly recommended but this was probably the worst Indian food I've ever eaten. I've been to many Indian restaurants all over the world and have never been so unsatisfied. 

The paneer was completely tasteless, I had to cover it in salt and pepper and sauce to give it some character. The chicken was dry. The mango chutney seemed to just be random chunks of orange peel soaked in sugar syrup. And the Indian pickles, for some reason were drenched in alcohol/spirit and was completely inedible. The only thing slightly OK was the Pokoras. And the rice. 

We look for the improvement needed."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean and the service was good. The food was very rich, delicious and well spiced. I also found that their menu descriptions and spiciness ratings were accurate for the dishes we tried. Overall, a great value for the money. 

I have eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants in the bay area and Sitara is on par with big city cuisine. I recommend trying them!"}
{"text":"I visited Sitara just after they had opened. There was a surprise inspection there at the same time. They had to shut off their oven ( which makes me wonder what was wrong in the first place) due to which we could not get any type of breads that we had previously ordered. This was told to us after waiting 30-40 mins for the food. They just got the curry along with rice and told us this is all they can make right now. No apologies, nothing. 

I heard good reviews about the food and went back to give it another shot. But the food failed to impress me. I tried a couple of different chicken dishes. The food was just average. Nothing great.  I even tried a bread other than the Naan. It was nothing like what it is supposed to be ( I am from India and I know what I'm ordering)"}
{"text":"Sitara is small, authentic, and has incredible service. I love Indian food, and this place rivaled all other restaurants I've been to. Very friendly servers and staff. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Its alright. Good place to sit down, good decor etc. Samosas could have been better. I feel the food is kind of the same as all the other indian places in C-U."}
{"text":"Had the thaili(not sure if I spelt the name correct. It's on the last page of the menu) lunch. It was only $8.99, but contains chicken, rice, salad, and dessert! Like their Dessert very much. It was a kind of milk dessert, and seems contains rice. Creamy but not very sweet. And the sweet yogurt drink Tassi was also very good. It could be better if they have some cooked vegetables in the chicken meal."}
{"text":"Best place in Chambana to get delicious Indian food. Good prices, too!"}
{"text":"Quite easily the best (Northern) Indian restaurant in Champaign-Urbana, and one of the best I've been to anywhere. The food is fresh, and the range of flavors broad and well balanced. Spice level is very moderate and can be increased on request for those desiring a more invigorating experience. The napkins are cloth and quite absorbent, very capable of handling a level 3 Vendaloo's worth of forehead sweat.

I'd list the dishes I prefer but they have all been excellent and I have no one favorite, though I do get the fish curry and chicken do pyaza more frequently than others. I love rice but choose paratha nine times out of ten, only occasionally getting rice or garlic naan. The samosas are perfect and don't forget the tamarind sauce, which is a great highlight to the main dish also.

I'm not sure how anyone could give this place one star, especially having not even tried the food. 
The owner Bobby is a straight shooter, by all means check your ticket but I find it difficult to believe he or his staff are cheating the totals."}
{"text":"I feel like giving them a 2 star is being kind. Should of paid better attention to the health department warning outside. Food is just okay, but the overall cleanliness is not up to par. Would not recommend. 
Wait staff is very slow."}
{"text":"Huge pleasant surprise! The naan was so delicious like those we find on Devon street (Indian Town) in Chicago. The rest of the dishes were a bit salty but still very tasty."}
{"text":"It was good! A nice treat in downtown Urbana. I love the smell and the vibe of this place. The naan was a temptation, I haven't had better. The prices were cheap and they give you a standard size that was enough to fill me up. And Indian channel with non-stop music videos was playing, that added to the overall entertainment."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here after I read other reviews on Yelp, and consulted another friend of mine.  We had TONS of food (3 appetizers, naan, and a main course for each of us) and our total was just under $40.  This was my first experience with Indian food, and I'm pleased to say that I'll be back!  I had the Butter Chicken, which is Tandoori Chicken in a tomato sauce with rice.  It was delicious.  My friend had the Chicken Vendaloo, which was also quite tasty.  The naan was soft and pillowy and great for sopping up the extra sauce.  We each had a samosa (yummm) and shared the aloo tikki appetizer (so, so good with each of the provided dipping sauces).  We split the chicken sekuwa appetizer as well.  After being intimidated by Indian food for so long, I'm glad I finally took the plunge at Sitara.

UPDATE:  I visited again the other night and had the Tandoori Shrimp.  Holy cow, it was amazing.  It's served with rice and yellow dal and everything was so tasty.  Thanks again, Sitara!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch on a Saturday. The staff was nice and the vegetarian options were yummy and inexpensive ($14 for two lunch entrees and naan). It's a great addition to downtown Urbana and it's nice to have an option for Indian food outside of Bombay."}
{"text":"the food here is quite good.  came by with water frequently.  take out takes them awhile...expect 40 minutes.  my only complaint is that they either never have the Indian pickles, or forget to bring them out to me.  the ambience is nice inside, but sit near the front for better AC.  I sat in the back once and it was really hot."}
{"text":"I usually format all my reviews with \"Good,\" \"Meh,\" and \"Bad\" lists. However, I cannot think of anything bad about this place. The food is great, the service is helpful, but not pushy. Did I say the food is awesome? Before eating here, I didn't like Indian food. Now I loveIndian food. We tried the tandoori mixed grill, the mixed vegetarian appetizer, and the garlic naan. All were superb. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes Indian food, and maybe even if you don't, I didn't before eating here!"}
{"text":"It's a shame that I had to give this place only a 3 star rating, even though the food was quite good and I have recently started to really like Indian food. The problem was the service. I'm normally not picky about service, as long as I get what I ordered I'm happy. But decide for yourself whether the following is acceptable to you. They're supposed to open at 4:30, and we arrived at 4:35 to find the door closed and locked. My wife and I then walked around the block for a few minutes to wait, came back, and the place still wasn't open. I peered through the window to check if anyone was inside, and made eye contact with two of the restaurant staff. They stared at me, then went back to chatting with each other (they weren't even busy preparing tables or anything). By this time it was around 4:45.

Once inside, we basically got the cold shoulder treatment, as if they were being passive-aggressive about my peering inside earlier. No smiles, no welcoming attitude, and when they came to take our order they just stood next to us without saying or asking anything. We ordered a lot so we had plenty left over, and specifically asked for TWO boxes to go, and they only brought one of the small boxes, which was clearly inadequate for how much we had left. So in summary, 4/5 for the food, 1/5 for the service, 3/5 overall."}
{"text":"Went to Sitara yesterday for the first time.  What a nice surprise after having eaten at another Indian restaurant int he area a few months ago.  Great service, excellent food and  nice decor.  Staff were friendly and attentive and service was quick.  Excellent food!  Will be going back."}
{"text":"Ok Indian food for the area.  I've been there at least 5 times. My most recent visit I had really bad service. Seated myself at the bar.  Ordered my food.  After 20 minutes they deliver my meal to the party further down by the bar.  I asked the person who took my order about my food and that I think they Los delivered my food.  She told me it was something else and she was told to stay out of the kitchen. Then later confirms that was my meal.  Wasted 30 minutes and ended up walking out.  I will never return."}
{"text":"Best Indian food one can get in Urbana-Champaign. The service is slow but worth the wait! I land up here once or twice every week."}
{"text":"Great. Just plain great.
Been going here since they opened and I've never been disappointed. My only complaint is that they could do with kicking the spice up a bit on the vindaloo but flavor wise it's perfect. The service is always solid. I really don't know what to say other than this is the best place to get Indian food in town. I hope they never close."}
{"text":"I go to Sitara as often as possible. Their paneer dishes are to die for. Service is always friendly and food is always delicious. Their sister store in Champaign is also worth checking out."}
{"text":"We've been 3-4 times now.  This is one of the places that my wife and I go with her family when they're in town and we've never been disappointed.  It's one of our go-to spots in Urbana.  

The tandoori chicken is extremely good - nicely flavored and tender.  Plus you get the fun presentation when it comes out on the sizzling metal platter, surrounded with onions and peppers.  

We have tried a variety of dishes and they've always been tasty.  Some of the standouts are the lamb korma, the saag paneer, and the chicken makhani.  I also had a very tasty fish curry.  I like how the dishes come out in the small bowls - it also makes it easier to share and for everyone to try a little bit of everything.  

The sauces are very rich and filling, so we almost always end up with leftovers.  

The naan is fluffy and delicious.  The rice is good too, but it's hard not to get the naan every time.

The service has also been fairly prompt - in the past we've gone and it's been almost empty, but last time the restaurant was fairly full, so I guess the word is getting out."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and service! I have loved everything I've  tried here!! The cheese naan, and house special naan is absolutely fabulous!!!! If you're unsure of what to try, order a thali plate. The thali plate has a sampling of several different dishes, with rice and naan."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. The owner is wonderful. My favorites are dal makahni and palak paneer. Extensive vegetarian menu. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Although the food was quite good, the service was absolutely TERRIBLE.  We had a long wait which was understandable on a Saturday night, however, once we got seated it all went downhill.  We ordered an appetizer and three dinners.  They did not have any Chai (tea) left and this was fairly early in the evening - 7:00 pm. and did not seem interested in making any.  After approximately 25 minutes we had to ask where our meal was.  They brought out one meal out of three then after about another 10-15 minutes and our asking several times, they brought out the appetizer followed by the additional two meals about five minutes after the appetizer.  

This place desperately needs a manager - no one seemed to know what they were doing other than their immediate job.  Needless to say, after experiencing the long delays and errors and less than interested servers, we will not return."}
{"text":"Delicious. Me and my mother are visiting the area to see some friends of hers, and we went to sitara our first night in town, and it was absolutely fantastic. The restaurant was no food network phenomenon but it was classy and reasonably priced, the food was great, service okay if a little slow. The only hitch is I ordered a drink and it just..dissapeared. He almost set it on the table, and then walked away, never to give it to me again."}
{"text":"Delicious Indian food in a cozy atmosphere. Fun Bollywood movies on screens add to the festive feel. Food is great. The portions look small, in their beautiful little dishes, but I never leave hungry. Flavors are rich and well developed. Usually 3dishes is enough for 4 people. The staff is always friendly and service is consistently good."}
{"text":"Very clean and attractive place in a former bar. They've kept the bar, but it could benefit from adding more booths. It's the same management and menu as Bombay Indian Grill (at Green & 6th St., Champaign). There's more room to spread out at Sitara, and fewer students.  I've come here for dinner several times since it opened. The food is awesome.  service is great.  prices are reasonable. The beer selection is limited to domestic macro and Indian malt liquor, all pretty gross.  Stick with water."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of the food at Sitara. The quality of the food is good, and the flavors are spot on. I've done both eating in and take out, and I would suggest doing take out if you're short on time because the service can be a bit slow. I personally feel like the entrees could be just a little bit bigger, and I wish they would add onion chutney to their chutney offerings."}
{"text":"Owned by previous manager and Chef of Bombay Grill. Nice start, careful handling of customers. Maybe need to prune their menu, it is expansive. Recommended as the best option in Champaign-Urbana for Indian .....not saying much :-("}
{"text":"The food was \"okay.\" It's not the real-deal because it lacks the 12+ spices that you'd get in a homemade meal. Maybe my perspective is warped by fantastic indian food in other cities, but the food is probably not worth the price (to me)."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but the food and drinks were very good. Try one of their lassis and a vindaloo dish for an amazing combination. Their naan is pretty much on-point as well."}
{"text":"Chicken Vindaloo and Tandori Chicken... (yeah, I like chicken!) was had today for lunch.  It was way good.  The naan was massive.  The staff was on top of things.  one star off for making me ask for Raita for my Tandori chicken.. come on!  Overall it was great.
i'll be back.
ps. thanks for not being an Indian Buffet spot, there is a time and a place for that, but not in downtown Urbana.  Make us order dishes, and not have to waddle out big american style."}
{"text":"I've been to Sitara three or four times now and the food is really good - especially the chicken tikka masala and the palak paneer. The naan bread is very fresh and tasty. The service is great and they deliver too, promptly and cheerfully. So glad they opened up in downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"Went back again for take out. 
Portions were great and the flavor was above average. Ordered the lamb vindaloo, and got a heaping container of vindaloo and another good sized container for rice. And the garlic naan was very very good. 

When I stopped by to pick it up I asked one of the staff members why Somosa wasn't on the menu, he said \"it's on the dinner menu, you can ask for it any time\"

Very helpful and friendly staff. 
Food is still good and at a fair price."}
{"text":"Its a new place and we went to check it out. The ambience was really good but the food was exactly opposite to that...In one word it was \"horrible\" and the presentation was even \"worse\". We ordered lamb and chicken biryani. It seems that it was more of boiled rice mixed with turmeric and cooked meat. The appetizers were also not well cooked. The lollipop chicken was so small in size that I felt sorry for the actual weak chicken. There was some $16 chicken dish with 5-6 different styled chicken dishes. I felt one of the chicken pieces tasted funny...oohhh... The food was totally bland and tasteless...worst indian food I have had in my 6 years of Champaign life. The only good thing I would say was the mango lassi and the gulab jamun. Although I am not sure if the gulab jamun was made in their kitchen or was from a tin can.

The owner of this place used to work in Bombay India on Green St and the food there was good or atleast the biryani there was pretty good. His current place Sitara's food is no where compared to the Bombay's food. It is surprising. With this kind of food, I am not so sure this restaurant will survive. Probably change the cook. I am never going there again and would not recommend it to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Friendly attentive service, serving tasty Indian cuisine. I've had their biryani and lamb vindaloo. Both dishes were beautifully prepared and came piping hot from the kitchen. The naan is very good here as well. I've had the garlic and cheese varieties (so far).

I like my food spicy and they had no problem making my order spicier than usual. The Bollywood shows they have on the TVs provided good entertainment during the meal as well.

Overall I'd say this place is deserving of the good ratings it has received so far."}
{"text":"Sitara has the standard north-Indian cuisine which is toned down a little to suit the american palate without loosing the flavor!

Ambiance is of a closed dance-bar or a gastro-pub. There is a huge bar which seems out of place. The bathroom area is best to be avoided before ordering your food. Overall service is less than good. Wait staff is running around doing a lot of things and don't have time to tend to your needs, so if you need something ask anyone!! We had two vegetarian entrees with rice and naan and some raita. Everything was freshly made without frozen curry. Taste was very good and overall I enjoyed the meal. Portion sizes are good for two people to share but only one dish between two might be too little for main meal. I was able to get a lunch out of left overs the next day. 

This restaurant has potential to provide better experience but as long as food is good, I will still come back again."}
{"text":"Great food! Huge portions.

I wish there was a dinner special like the lunch specials, and there was somewhere more to wait. 

Also a little on the pricey side, but overall quite good."}
{"text":"Authentic and tasty curry. The Naam that goes with curry is a must-have."}
{"text":"Sitara is the most authentic Indian food I've ever had. I absolutely love it. Great quality for the price and quick! I would eat here every day if I could. The Na'an is fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Best Indian in Chambana. Absolutely delicious, blows every other Indian place in Chambana out of the water with taste.

-1 star for service. Good luck getting seated if you're an introvert. Will be standing for days for a seat. Take a deep breath and catch a person aggressively to get seated within the day."}
{"text":"Truly indian taste.. authenticate and taste. Will recommend all my frnds who pass by champaign."}
{"text":"This was a great hole in the wall! I never knew of this place until I found it through yelp. It has a very cute atmosphere. Food-wise, I found the curries to have a slightly different taste/kick than most Indian restaurants (this place might have some Nepalese roots). However, the meats were tender and the curries were flavorful. Great place for a date."}
{"text":"Not the best Indian food, but it is the best in Urbana-Champaign.  I'm a big fan of the space as well, although it does get crowded during peak hours (like every other decent restaurant in town)."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food at Sitara. We regularly order food from here when we host game days at our house in Urbana. Most of the time we pick up the order because they don't always have a delivery driver, or the delivery is super slow. I've never been disappointed by portion sizes, taste or value. They have a very small dine-in area, and the service was quite slow the only time I've gone. They are definitely not accessible, as there is a step up into the establishment and the booths are on a platform."}
{"text":"I go here weekly and am never disappointed. Sometimes the service can take longer that I'd expect, but they are always busy -- so it's not like they are taking too long on purpose. If you are vegan you can ask for special preparation of a few dishes, where they won't use ghee. Overall a lovely place that has really added to the awesomeness of downtown Urbana!"}
{"text":"Really good Indian, especially enjoyed the chicken tiki marsala and the naan. The yellow dal was a little runny for my personal taste, but still very flavorful. Generally good service (I have a toddler, and they were VERY supportive and attentive to what we needed), although a couple missteps. All in all, we're headed back again!"}
{"text":"Strongly recommend most or all of the vegetarian options -- the malai kofta, paneer makhani, paneer tikka masala, paneer do pyaza are all delicious! I would actually say this is one of my favorite restaurants in CU. The only downside is that some nights of the week it can be hard to get a table. Tuesdays for some reason seem to be packed..."}
{"text":"Lunch special Thalis offer a nice variety. Otherwise, the rice dishes, e.g number 37, is another great option for people who enjoy tasting a little bit of everything, and want to avoid the stress of deciding which curries and rice or naan to order a la carte. Fair prices, tasty food, and comfortable location."}
{"text":"Glad to update that this place definitely deserves 5 stars. At Sitara they consistently serve delicious Indian cuisine for a great price. Service never disappoints, and we just love coming here. If you haven't been yet, what are you waiting for?"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for the first time this Father's Day (2014). The restaurant is small and can easily be missed if you drive by in the car. There is no street parking, but there is ample parking in the structure immediately behind Sitara (and parking in the structure currently is free on weekends and on weekday evenings). Inside it is clearly a former bar. Lots of wood, a beautiful bar; a few booths and small tables line the South side of Sitara. 

Service was excellent. We were greeted as soon as we walked in, and seated immediately. The lunch menu is extensive, with sections for appetizers, vegetable dishes, lamb dishes, fish dishes, chicken dishes, bread dishes, and rice dishes (each with as few as 10 or as many as 20 listings). When we visited the prices began at 7.99, with most at 9.99. Meals include either naan or rice and an entree. We tried a lamb and a fish dish, and we both liked both of them. We also had an appetizer of vegetables prepared tempura-like with delicious sauces.

Our water and drink glasses were never less than half full and both our waiter and other employees checked on us several times during the meal, making sure the food was good, hot, spiced properly, etc. There were several tables with children, but there doesn't appear to be a children's menu. (They may have one, but we didn't see it.) The tables are small and close together, so it may be difficult for a person in a wheelchair or walker. The naan was freshly made when we ordered it, and it was delicious. Just a slight puff, but still dense; you could taste the char-grill on it, just right, as should be the case. The lamb was tender and plentiful in the sauce. The fish was excellent too, though to my taste the sauce overwhelmed the fish flavor a little too much. Tasty, but I prefered the lamb because the balance of meat and sauce flavors let the best of both come through.

There were several flat screen televisions playing Indian music videos. They were not unpleasant-- not too loud and one could easily talk and be heard. 

All in all I like Sitara a lot and recommend it highly. Everything is freshly made and delicious. We will definitely return to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"I just wonder why Sitara gets so much crowd and a 4 star rating on yelp. This is a very average restaurant and none of their food has any correlation to how the actual dish tastes.

positives
  - Ambience is decent.
  - Taste of food isn't awful unlike the other Indian restaurants in Champaign.
  - Their yellow dal is probably the only food which is good. Sometimes their samosas are ok.

negatives
  - The food prepared though named after indian dishes, do not taste anything like that. Especially the Biryani is laughable since its just some masala rice. It tastes ok but please don't call it Biryani. The same goes for most of their dishes. This is the only place that gives Biryani without Raita. Also their rice that comes with other accompaniments is so poor in quality.
 - Too much artificial color in the food.
 - The various entrees with Paneer are just messed up.
 - The chicken and lamb mostly taste stale and only fish hasn't been that bad. 
 
If you want to eat something which tastes like Indian food go to bloomington and there are some good restaurants there, hope they would start one here."}
{"text":"I love Sitara. I always get the same thing, but it's because it is so good that I don't want to try anything else. (I probably should, I am sure that everything they cook is delicious). I usually got samosa chaat and chicken vendaloo. Samosa chat is so delicious, so fresh and full of glavor! And vindaloo is perfectly spicy and chicken is so tender that it really melts in your mouth. Service is very attentive when I dine there and I order for delivery frequently as well."}
{"text":"Really good northern Indian food.  Not too spicy.  Plenty for the money."}
{"text":"I go to sitara Indian restaurant quite often. I love that place. Every time I go there I am never disappointed. I usually order samosas as an appetizer which I am in love with. Their chilli chicken is my another favorite item. You should give it a try. It's juicy and a little spiciness just does its magic. The chicken curry dish is simple and very tasty I get that with basmati rice. I am just very satisfied with the food, it's cozy ambience and cheerful staff. Must try place if you haven't !!"}
{"text":"I'm not an expert on Indian food, but I really enjoyed the food at Sitara. It was absolutely delicious. I had the lamb vindaloo. The lamb was tender and tasty. The menu says it's spicy, but I didn't think it was spicy. I do like spicy food though, but I thought it was very manageable. I also had the garlic naan and oooh my goodness!!!! It is SOOOO good!!!! You have to try the garlic naan! I will be getting the garlic naan every time I come here. 

The only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five is because I thought the portions were too small for the price. I still got full from my meal, but I still think the portions should be bigger for the price."}
{"text":"Namaste (Nah ma stay) right here!!!  
This food will make your toes curl and you will hum with happiness with each mouthful. 
The minute you walk in the door your senses are assailed with the warm and aromatic fragrances of Indian spices.  You are greeted promptly and the service is attentive, informative and friendly.  
The menu is loaded with choices from seafood to chicken and from lamb to a bounty of vegetarian options.  If all the vegetable dishes in my realm tasted like these-I'd happily hoist the vegetarian flag and fly it proudly!
I live in Atlanta and come here to visit my Bestie of over 35 years.  EVERY time I arrive-Sitara is my go-to place for a meal that I have been craving ever since I left. 
If you do not enjoy spicy hot dishes-there is plenty on the menu for you and the spicy hot ones are truly wonderful-there is something for everyone. 
The prices are more than fair and I always have plenty to take home and moan over again. 
Do your self a favor and go to Sitara and you too will be saying \"Namaste\" right here!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, the Alloo Tiki (sp? - app for 2.99) were delicious and vibrant. 

Entrees, a chicken curry and a masala, were good (9.99 a 10.99) and the accompanying basmati was brightened with some saffron, shaved carrots and a hint of fennel.

Service was prompt and helpful.  Great addition to Urbana fare."}
{"text":"Simply amazing! There are few times in my life that I've received food still steaming and crackling because it was so hot and fresh. The sampler was top notch and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This is in the top 5 of ALL restaurants in Champaign/Urbana.  The garlic naan, spicy chicken, shrimp, Samosas, all excellent.

My only criticism, they seem to have an aversion to putting ice in your drinks, its odd but easily remedied.

I look forward to every visit go this wonderful place!"}
{"text":"First time here and I had an ok experience.  It's located two doors down from the Iron Post in Urbana.   The restaurant looks like a bar.... A really long bar with a dozen seats....not sure what the purpose of it was....I guess they didn't bother renovating from the previous tenants.  Then a bunch of booths and a few tables.... Think Black Dog but with more room.   I had my 1yr old with me and figured she'd love some chicken korma and rice.  She LOVES rice... But not here... korma is usually fairly mild (as stated in their menu) with lots of flavor, but this had a bit of a kick to it....my nose was running.  After three bites, she was spitting it out and pushing it away.   I also ordered some samosas, and they were really good, but again a bit of a kick and my daughter didn't like them.  We tried ordering a mango lassi from the menu, but the waiter said that they had a mango shake....i asked what the difference was and he just shrugged his shoulders and said, \"They're similar\".   Similar as in how?  He couldn't tell me.   He suggested mango juice, so I agreed and he basically sat a glass of mango concentrate in front of me.... Kind of gross.  From where we were seated, i had a decent view of the kitchen....I saw them putting a lot of things in the microwave....heard lots of beeping as dish after dish finished in there...not sure what they were nuking... Kind of made me uneasy.... I've been in enough restaurants, cooking classes and seen enough food network to know that microwaves aren't really used that often or at all?!   Anyway,  it was ok...but I'd opt for Bombay Indian Grill any day of the week."}
{"text":"Great food. Awful service. I went one night at 7pm and was immediately sat at the bar. I waited 15 minutes to order. After ordering I waited at least 45 minutes for the food. Drink refills were slow. Waiter was not friendly. Honestly, order take out and then you don't have to deal with the service. The food was great but didn't make up for the time spent waiting."}
{"text":"Sitara is one of my favorite spots in town! I grew up going to Indian restaurants on Devon Ave in Chicago and Sitara is comparable to some of the best restaurants up there. While I see that some people have complained about wait time, I have never experienced a wait of more than 20min from time of ordering to food being served. My favorites are the paneer tika, butter chicken, and naan. I highly recommend this place to anyone with a love of Indian food!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time a couple years ago, and it's still just as amazing. I got the samosa chaat, chicken vindaloo, and kadai paneer. Everything was really flavorful with lots of spice, just how I like it. Entrees also come with choice of naan or rice which is nice. It is a smaller place and does get crowded, but staff is really fast and accommodating. I've tried every Indian restaurant in the C-U area, and this is definitely the BEST hands down."}
{"text":"Not the best north Indian food we have ever tried, but the best in town. We ate here several times since it opened and it was consistently good. If you're like me and don't get anything that doesn't contain meat, I recommend you make an exception for the Bhindi Masala (okra curry)."}
{"text":"Great Indian food! Really delicious, generous portions. They have a Thali special is an amazing array of Indian favorites that is offered vegetarian or no vegetarian for $7.99 and $8.99 respectively. The also have a pretty well executed menu to choose from with a lot of traditional north Indian dishes. I love Indian food for all its complexity and flavor and this place did not leave me disappointed. Definitely try it out for a quick and delightful lunch."}
{"text":"There is so much I would like to say, but will try not to get carried away. The most significant and noticeable issue was that the service and attitude of the staff was appalling. The staff seemed to find speaking to the customers distasteful and avoided it at all costs. When they did speak, it was mumbled. I also caught one eye roll from our waiter when I ordered. When our food was brought to the table, by someone other than 'our' waiter, it was plonked down (yes literally just plonked down). The server did not ask which dish belonged to whom, just walked away without a single word. We had to slide the plates around to the right person. I was drinking masala tea, which was served tepid at best, and water. Our water was never refilled, the waiter never bothered to come back for anything at all after he took our order and we had to wave someone else over to get the bill when we were ready to leave. I ordered Paneer with peas and rice served with sauce. The rice was bone dry and the scant 1/3 cup of sauce sitting in the bottom of the serving bowl was so inadequate that it just disappeared into the food. My husband ordered chicken that was listed as 'marinated and BBQ'd' but when it came to the table it looked like shriveled up sweet potatoes accompanied by loads of barely cooked bell pepper and onion. Awful! Will never go back."}
{"text":"I love this Indian restaurant! I've been to many across Central Illinois and have even been to India. Their chicken mahkani is great and can be ordered at several levels of spicyness. Naan is great, too. The service has always been excellent. They even made lamb jalfrenzi for me even though it wasn't on the menu. In addition, their prices are some (if not the most) affordable in town!"}
{"text":"Fairly disappointed with the food..seeing so many good reviews we decided to try this one out - we ordered the masala papad, aloo tiki, chicken biryani and a new dish garlic masala chicken but almost all the dishes were just about average..there are many other better Indian restaurants in this area - try them out first!"}
{"text":"Sitara has the best Indian food in town. I don't know what happened to this place, but I hope they can be open again soon. I miss their naan and chicken vendoloo!"}
{"text":"I am new to the area and am starting to test out restaurants.  This one did not disappoint.  I deducted one star because the delivery time was going to take an eternity, so I had to go pick it up.  I know that doesn't sound like a huge hardship, but I was already in my PJs and parking is a little tricky there.  That said, the food was great.  

I ordered the following:

Samosas:  they were crispy and soft in the perfect way.  The potato filling was super tasty and they are not shy with spices. The green dipping sauce (sorry, no idea what it's called) was spicy and delicious.  I could eat these all day.  Probably shouldn't.

Veggie curry: Fantastic!  Great mix of veggies, not too much cream. Even better reheated the next day.  Finishing it as I type.

I look forward to eating there, it looks like a cute, laid-back space."}
{"text":"This is the only Indian restaurant in the CU area that serves authentic indian food. Definitely very spicy because thats what comes along with the indian food. If you cannot take the spice i suggest you mention it to you server prior to ordering. I would choose this place over any other indian place in the CU area.
EDIT: I have edited this review after having eaten from this place regularly for over 2 years. The service is very bad, they refuse to deliver on most occasions and don't even have a tie-up with grub hub, order up, or eatCU. This is very frustrating, as being in a college town being able to deliver is very important."}
{"text":"I love Indian food. I've eaten it around the world. Well, I once had it in Manchester, UK... Anyway, I really love it. I'm a vegetarian, it's easy to be one of those in Indian restaurants.

So, after 20 years of being a veggy, I've found what I think is the best Indian place ever, and it's here in Urbana. Whodathunk? Lucky us.

It can get crowded at typical dining hours, BECAUSE IT'S GREAT FOOD... so, maybe go a little early."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, in such an obscure location. Much better than the inflated fare one gets in New Jersey. We ended up here on our college trip & took a chance, were pleasantly surprised. The Sheek kebab was very fine, chilly mutton gravy was tasty. Biryani though was not the usual hyderabadi style, more of a fried rice version. Beware the portions, its tuned towards hungry students trying to stock up."}
{"text":"Update:  I had previously written the bellow review with 4 stars.  However, I must now change it to 1 or even less.  I just called them to make an order for pickup.  I am not Indian and am not the most sophisticated when it comes to Indian food.  I tried asking a few questions about their Chicken Chili before making my order.  The guy on the other end was extremely short with me and even hung up on me.  If this is how they treat people then I will not be going back.  My post can be updated again with a good response from management.  

Previous Post:  We ate at Sitara the other night.  I had one of the paneer dishes and thought it was outstanding.  I also ordered two orders of naan.  The naan was huge, the size of a blanket (slight exaggeration).  Our waiter, Johnny Bravo, did a wonderful job.  I didn't give this five stars because I decided to be more picky in my reviews.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm here on a weekly basis, often multiple times a week to get my fix. I've finally had a less than ideal experience and I'm so happy that the owner handled it perfectly. I would hate to lose my delicious Indian food because of one unpleasant experience! As soon as the owner heard of my displeasure, he handled it immediately and appropriately. I still love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with coworkers at lunch on 9/25. It was an excellent experience. The three of us each had samosa as appetizers (they're not on the lunch menu, but just ask for them) and we shared three entrées, along with plain and garlic naan.

The samosa were excellent, with good flavor and a healthy kick - probably the tastiest samosas I've had in a while. The coriander chutney was deliciously fresh, and one coworker who accompanied me said it was reminiscent of the way she liked it back home in India.

The naan (garlic and plain) was delicious, and our main courses - two chicken dishes and channa masala also met with our satisfaction. The two different chicken dishes had distinct flavors with a good level of spice and flavor. The channa masala was also delicious; we asked them to crank up the heat on this one, and they obliged.

We were all pleased with our meal, and the price was fair for the quantity and quality of food. The entrées are served in brass bowls with china plates.

It's hard to believe that a mere dozen years ago, we had NO Indian cuisine in Champaign-Urbana; we now have several excellent choices including Sitara, both on-campus and off.

We will definitely be back. This fine Indian restaurant is a great addition to the dining options in downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and get the same thing every time: The shrimp vendaloo spicy x2. The naan is incredible and for lunch it's around $8.00. My only complaint is that the bar is underutilized. They need to do something with the decor to make that more appealing."}
{"text":"$10 for Butter Chicken with Naan and I had leftovers which is a good deal, in my opinion. It took a little while to get our food but that's probably because we were a group of 8. I love Indian food and these flavors are definitely authentic."}
{"text":"I like Sitara but it's not any different from Casablanca Kabab House. There's not a strong enough pull to leave campus for this place."}
{"text":"OK but not overwhelmed. Not too different from the other Indian places on campus (I mean the one on 4th and green) Better for the dining environment though. Service is meh."}
{"text":"Sitara Indian Restaurant and Lounge, 114 S. Race St., U:

Inspected Nov. 2, by Champaign-Urbana Public Health District inspectors with an adjusted score of 30 (35 and below is a FAIL) and six critical violations, including making yogurt without a permit or license, chicken and beans out of safe temperature ranges and an employee talking on a cellphone while handling food in the kitchen. The restaurant was reinspected Dec. 2 with an adjusted score of 89."}
{"text":"It's best indian food around. Love the Palak Paneer!  I have had it delivered a ton of times and it is always amazing"}
{"text":"The food is very good, I would give the restaurant a 4.5 rating.  But the last two times we went to this place, we had to grab a waiter, demand to order, and BOTH times, we left after 30+ min of waiting for our food.  So if you are visiting off-hours, its a good place.  They are doing a lot of carryout and the in-store customers are lower priority."}
{"text":"I love that the seekhs come out on a sizzler plate. The lamb is tender, delicate, a perfect balance of spices against the sweet onions and green peppers that are both sizzled and charred! The rice, lentils, okra, saag/palak paneer, & naan are the usual. Then it goes downhill. The Kashmiri naan is all fruit sans that nutty flavor that comes from using actual dry fruits rather than the packaged artificially colored ones. And they screwed up their butter chicken. Between July 2016 and now. Heavy on tomatoes, clunky curry, lacking the ginger-coriander garnish, and the kind of marination that seeps into the chicken, this dish tastes as if they just tossed boiled chicken chunks into butter, added a ready made curry and threw in some tomatoes for good measure."}
{"text":"I came here twice within one week. We ordered lamb curry and butter chicken with naan the first time and samosas + naan + 2 orders of lamb curry the latter. The first time was a Saturday evening and it was busy, taking us close to 45 min to get our food but goodness EVERYTHING was fresh. I would wait that long again. 

The curry was labeled mild but had a lot of spices and seasonings which made it great. Service was nice but best of all were the prices. Amazing meal with quality and portions but won't break the bank."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and had the chicken vindaloo. The curry was good, had good flavor and the right amount of spiciness. I have tried all but 1 other of the Indian restaurants in the CU area and this is at the top of the list so far.

1 star deducted for 2 reasons:

1. Service was subpar. The glass of water I got was lukewarm. Had maybe 1 sip of water left in the glass and the server looked at my table, walked by a few times without refilling, went back behind the bar and was on his phone. About the 4th time he finally came back and finally refilled the water....with more lukewarm water.

2. The vindaloo had broccoli in it. I've had vindaloo plenty of times and have had different places add a variety of veggies, but never crunchy broccoli. It was kind of random and kind of seemed like it was a random vegetable added to the dish to stay true to the menu that said \"a curry with assorted veggies\". Honestly it took away from the dish. 

I would most probably come back here and try another dish and hope that service is a little better."}
{"text":"Should have discovered this place earlier. Best Indian restaurant in town with very reasonable prize. Awesome environment and good services. My boyfriend and I ordered sauteed shrimp as appetizer, a chicken entree, a lamb grill, plus two lasses for only a little over $30. The tandoori specialties are must-tries! I ordered seekh kabab, a lamb sausage kabab, and it tastes awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food. I would definitely recommend tandoori chicken more than anything. Perfect taste and spices. I also ordered paneer chili for appetizer. However, it was way too oily and greesy than normal. So that would be the down side. For entrees, I ordered chicken tikka masala and naan (it comes with one complimentary naan). It was delicious. Chicken was cooked perfectly. Everything was great."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty Indian food. Definitely one of the better Indian places favor wise in Chambana. Service can be questionable at times depending on business and which waiter staff you get."}
{"text":"Tucked away on Race Street, the food is always good here. I typically go for some sort of lamb, a tikka masala, palaak paneer, naan and roti. It's better to go with more people so you can share & try more entrees. This is also a good place for vegetarian fare since there are so many options. Each entrée runs around $15. Service is friendly. When I crave Indian cuisine, this place satiates."}
{"text":"Great place.  I eat here often for lunch.  Why do I keep going back?  Because it is really good!  

The naan is the star of the show here.  Whoever the chef is really knows how to use the tandoori oven.  For me, the rest of the meal is just a vehicle by which I can consume more naan.  That being said, the jasmine rice is really good too.  I've only had it once... because I absolutely cannot resist the naan.  Man... I could go for some naan right now...

I've tried a lot of the items on the menu, and all of them have been good.  Plus, you get a lot of food for the price.  I wish they would cut out about half the bar to add more seating.  It sometimes gets pretty crowded at lunch (again, because it's REALLY good!).

The chicken korma is probably my favorite.  Really good flavor and heat.  It's a perfect dish for dipping naan in.  You know... because I like naan."}
{"text":"We have mixed feelings about Sitara. 

The food is often quite good (though not spectacular) and enough of a value to bring us back (dinner for two with the trimmings but without alcohol runs in the mid $30s). We love the onion kulcha, garlic naan, lamb \"vendaloo,\" lamb korma, and veg assorted appetizers. The green chili side sauce (served in a pot next to the standard tamarind sauce) is five stars for flavor and heat. The portions are decent (not too much or too little). The side of basmati rice is fluffy (you can ask for naan instead if you like). The masala tea is good, too, if not quite as hot (temperature) or fragrant (spiced) as I would prefer. Only real sugar is available and must be requested. Water is provided automatically but is room temp.

The biggest problem with Sitara is the poor service. We have experienced delays in getting seated, delays in having our order taken, incorrect amounts of items brought out, and so on. We've had the same older male server twice, and he's lacking in the graces of good service. He gives the impression that service is the last thing he'd like to be doing for a living. There are others on staff who do a better job from what we've seen, but we have rarely had the luck to interact with them. 

The other problem with Sitara is that it's an awkwardly designed space, long and narrow with a bar dominating the main dining area (leaving just a narrow aisle between tables and barstools). The outside door in the front (main entrance) opens up into this aisle and does not have a screen (so in summer flies enter readily, as well as heat and noise). The table nearest the door is literally right to the side of people entering. The tables in the back are near the noisome restrooms, which are directly across from the busy kitchen entrance. Not ideal. We do find the Indian music videos that play soundlessly on a couple of mounted flat screen TVs to be amusing to watch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Very reasonably priced and the food is delicious. I suggest the chicken tika masala, lamb vindaloo and the garlic naan. I highly recommend it! Service is also polite. They make sure that you always have enough to drink and are speedy."}
{"text":"Sitara opened on Tuesday, September 3, 2013. The owner used to be the counterman at Bombay at 4th & Green in campus.
Unlike Bombay, Sitara serves on china plates with metal flatware, waiter service and nicer digs all around.

I had the spicy fish chili  for $7.99 at lunch.  The Fish Chili has large chucks of whitefish and green peppers in a hot brown sauce. Excellent, with a nice kick to it. 

This place will be a regular lunch stop for Downtown Urbana folks.  Prices are reasonable, about the same as the Bombay at 4th & Green, but not eating off of styrofoam with plastic forks.  Lunch entrees were $5.99, $6.99 and $7.99.

Sitara is in the space formerly occupied by the Embassy, The Red Star Liquors, and Black Rock Pizza; all across the street from Busey Bank's parking lot on Race Street between Elm and Main."}
{"text":"I'm no Indian food expert, but after seeing such great reviews on Yelp and hearing so many people talk about this place, I had to check it out. The place was filled with older families and couples, very few students. 

I went with three friends and we split 4 dishes. (Lamb, chicken, vegetable, and rice) We opted for the traditional naan with our meal. Everything was spectacular! Ordering family style is certainly the way to go. 

I really look forward to coming back here and trying different dishes. I noticed they have different types of naan on the menu, so I'm very excited to explore those as well!"}
{"text":"This place is the best Indian food in the CU area. The Chicken Korma and the Naan are to die for. I can't get enough of Sitara!"}
{"text":"I was overjoyed that an Indian restaurant opening up in downtown Urbana! And I was right to be excited - this place is wonderful. The service is quick and the food was great. I was dining in for once, and ordered the Vegetarian Thali dish, and I cannot recommend it enough - it's a crazy amount of food for $7.

I've heard that Sitara might be owned by or otherwise connected to Bombay Grill, and I will say the food tastes very similar. Fortunately for me I also love Bombay Grill. :)"}
{"text":"Sitara was a pleasant surprise in the Indian food scheme of the C-U area, with good flavors and a casual but comfortable ambience.  The tandoori chicken was pleasantly tender and moist (a hit-or-miss in C-U).  Prices in general are OK, at $9-12 for entrees.  The only complaint is that the staff didn't cut up the naan, which made eating and sharing a bit awkward.  Stop by if you're in the area, for a casual lunch or dinner experience."}
{"text":"Me and my mom frequent this place when we are around the area and we love the food!!! The palak paneer, lamb vindaloo, naan, mango lassi, gulab jamun, and chana masala are some of our go-to's that we enjoy. However I wish there was better seating!"}
{"text":"Food was great. Naan is huge and delicious. Would have been a 5 star rating if they had had more tables as my fiancé and I had I sit at the bar to eat dinner, which is pretty difficult when eating Indian food. We will be back again, and will most likely be our go to to-go takeout spot."}
{"text":"Trying to visit a new place in C-U each time I go home. I am a big fan of Indian, so I suggested this spot to my brother. Easy street parking and there are other alternatives. I was there in the evening so street parking was free. We were seated right away as it was not that busy.

Order included:
ALOO TIKKI(2 pcs): Homemade potato patties spiced with touch of ginger and garlic, and deep fried ......... 2.99
CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA: Tender chicken roasted at clay oven cooked with creamy tomato ......................... 9.99
LAMB VENDALOO: (spicy) Delicious lamb cubes cooked in spicy sauce with seasonal vegetables .............................. 10.99
GARLIC NAAN: Leavened bread baked with chopped garlic stuff ...............2.99

The aloo tikki was GREAT. The sauce that came with the lettuce was a wonderful complement. The garlic naan was also quite good. Interesting though- It comes as a big piece. I am used to having small pieces. So we would just rip pieces off to eat with our entrees. The chicken tikka masala was OK. I like mine to be a bit spicier and a bit sweeter. So it was a bit on the bland side for me. My brother really enjoyed his lamb vendaloo is it is much spicier. This was on recommendation from our waiter. Affordable pricing, but the serving sizes are on the smaller side. Agree with Eric B. about the ice in the drinks. So odd. 

Our first waiter was helpful, but not very energetic. Our second waiter was outstanding. Joking and having fun with us. That improved the whole experience and made me bump up my rating from 3 stars to 4."}
{"text":"Place was busy waiting period for both or table was over 30 min It was 7:15 pm Saturday I should have known in Urbana IN student town! Anyway using my Hindi I got spot on Bar! Not comfortable but when you are hungry any thing goes
Ordered kadai paneer - soft cheese cubes with green peppers and tomato in spicy sauce see pic of bowl 
Food was prepared medium hot and Nan extra rice with glass of Red wine Cabernet 
Delicious , good service , 
Place like a diner with booths"}
{"text":"Clean and nice atmosphere. Waiters were attentive and gave refills when needed. Lunch was garlic nan, chicken tikka masala, and side of rice. Food was pretty good in comparison to the authentic foods I had in India."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the big hype and so many great reviews about this place. This is one of the worst Indian restaurants I have eaten in CU. I can vouch for this as I am an Indian and know very well what authentic Indian food tastes like. The spice level is toned down to cater to American people which is understandable but lacking in taste and flavor is completely unacceptable. The 2 stars I have given are only for their samosas and aloo tikki chaats. These are the only two dishes I feel they do justice. Their naans are huge and dripping with oil, not at all appealing! The aloo parathas are also a huge let down. I have tried at several occasion the chicken tikka masala and butter chicken, both tasted bland and same. There was no difference in the spices or gravy. The chicken pieces were also not cooked well. Their service is TERRIBLE. It takes for ages for them to serve food. Definitely it's a big disappointment as an Indian restaurant and I won't recommend this place to anyone. This place is simply overrated!"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price. We often order take out and get two meals out of each entre. 
Sitara grill is my favorite dish. Beer selection needs some improvement."}
{"text":"Probably the best overall indian resturant I have ever been to.  My friend took me here while I was in town.  The service was very attentive.  Their prices are very reasonable.  And their food is tasty with a unique twist on traditonal recipes.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Had lunch with friends and we each ordered a dish. Palak paneer, chicken tikka masala , aloo Gobi, and butter chicken all were excellent. I cannot wait to go again."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in the area. Period. 
My favorite chill spot.

I have been in champaign on a small time for work. Probably around 7 months. I travel more than most and rely and the vast Internet for food and drink. The Internet didn't provide me this spot. The locals praise it and directed me towards it. It has not only the friendliest staff but it has amazing Indian food for the area. It had amazing Indian food for all the places I've been to. 

Need a place to decompress? Have a beer at their bar and order something amazing."}
{"text":"There is nothing like puffy naan to cheer you up after a stressful week of midterms!

The smell of Indian spices greets you from just outside the restaurant, making your mouth water right away. Ive come here twice, the first time I ordered chicken vindaloo and the second butter chicken (spice level 2). Each time the waiter has questioned my spice tolerance and argued with me that I should get lower spice, which does get annoying, but at least they have your best interest in mind! Each dish comes with choice of rice or naan although the first time I came there they offered me both for free! There is no way you can come here without trying the garlic naan. If happiness came in bread form, it would be naan. My friend ordered the mango laasi which I tried and really recommend if you're looking for something to drink with your meal. Staff was very nice and fast!"}
{"text":"The foods really good but mannnn its SLOW when it gets busy... 40 minutes waiting to get 2 curry."}
{"text":"Must have been an off night tonight. Last time we went it was really good.

Food was bland and inconsistently seasoned. Lots of gnats flying around our booth. Restaurant was filled with smokey air with no circulation. Could hear the cooks / wait staff coughing and sneezing from the kitchen via our table."}
{"text":"Food was spicy even it said to be mild. But the curry tasted very good. Nan was soft and warm!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal...Had panak paneer and lamb curry with naan and it was excellent. Would highly recommend and I will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"I was on a short visit to Urbana, and visited this place. There are three types of Indian restaurants: 1. The ones Indians love, because it is authentic (but is not very much liked by others) 2. The ones everyone else loves, but Indians generally do not, because the cuisine is 'westernized' to cater everyone and 3. the rare ones that is liked by everyone because the food is just plain awesome. This one belongs to the second category, and I feel is pretty over-hyped. You can visit here once!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food. I love cooking it and I love eating it. Sitara is amazing when I want that feel good Indian meal without all the dishes. They have a huge menu and the flavors are amazing. I see some poor service complaints, but every time I've been the service has been wonderful. The only service issue worth complaining about is waiting to get a table when it's their dinner rush. It's almost always half full. Yea the water is served luke warm, but ice is kind of an American thing. I'd give them an extra star just for pure authenticity! And I'm sure if you asked for a cup of ice they'd oblige. Oh, did I mention how clean it is in the dinning area? (I can't speak for the bathrooms, never used them)

But back to the food... Can we say yum?! Nothing here is bland. But if you're afraid of Indian food because it's too spicy, I've never had a dish that I couldn't handle. If you ask for extra spice though, it'll knock your socks off. 

Dishes I'd recommend to anyone: 
Mutter paneer - it comes out a bright red color that looks like it would melt your face off, but don't be afraid! It's not spicy at all. But damn is it good. Chicken and vegetable korma - classic go to for me. Very creamy and tons of veggies. 
Chicken tikka - always a classic standby if you're just scoping the establishment out. 
The naan and specialty naans are also worth checking out. And make sure to ask for the mint chutney as a condiment. You can add it to your dish for a little more kick or dip your naan in it. 

Did I mention I love Sitara?"}
{"text":"Context: I'm a vegetarian Indian American, visiting from the Bay Area, where we have plenty of great Indian food.

Summary: I was genuinely delighted with my dinner on a weekday here. I had the samosa to start, followed by dal makhani with sides of rice and yogurt. I don't usually eat this much, and I could have easily split my dinner with a friend. The food I had was great and the service was friendly. The price was roughly half of what we expect to pay in the Bay Area.

Food: The samosa was done as well as some of the best I've had, appropriately portioned and well cooked with balanced texture and seasoning.  The dal makhani was rich and flavorful, with a fragrant aroma that made me wonder if it was possibly made with butter.

Service: They graciously accommodated my various off-menu requests. They were genuine and earnest about their work.

Ambiance: I enjoyed the ambiance with sturdy wood tables."}
{"text":"I love spicy food. And I chose level 5 for my lamb kadai. That was so good. I think probably this is the best Indian restaurant in town. Of course mango lassi is a must!"}
{"text":"Great kebabs...adequate spice...would strongly recommend...ambience is good...we ordered paneer tikka which had more gravy than expected but it turned out to be good...lassi was excellent"}
{"text":"The chicken Biryani wasn't good. I had it delivered and the guy forgot half my order. If the food tasted great I would have been completely okay with the mishap."}
{"text":"Took wife here 03/27/15. Great food and service. I received all kinds of husband points and wife rewards later."}
{"text":"When it comes to Indian this is the place. I have had almost everything under the chicken menu. Never disappoints. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Prices are great and they have great deals on gift certificates too for the holiday season."}
{"text":"I like the Indian food here; the vindaloo is to die for, the nan is perfect and the lassi drinks will make you want a second stomach. The service seems decent and the food comes out at a good rate; I'm not a huge fan of the inside and the Bollywood dance videos on the TV's but that's not a hard thing to get over."}
{"text":"The food is great. I had lamb vindaloo, samosas, and paneer pakora, I would order them all again. 

The place gets really busy, and there isn't a ton of space for people to wait so it can get cramped. They also do a lot of take out business, so aside from people waiting to dine in, there are also people waiting for carry out. 

Service is ok, I sat at the bar, so I felt better taken care of than those sitting at the tables. There aren't that many people working, so I suggest you go early to ensure better service. 

Overall, I am looking forward to my next visit to Sitara."}
{"text":"Alwayyyyyyyys a fan of Sitara. The chili chicken never fails."}
{"text":"A meal at Sitara always takes me back to my visits to the English countryside. The Empire's relationship to India has left the British homeland with at least one Indian restaurant in seemingly every village I traveled through. A local friend warned me that I shouldn't frequent an Indian restaurant if it happens to be the only choice in town (that advice turned out to be quite accurate as I unfortunately discovered). Let's just say those solitary waysides would not likely survive in Soho.

So although Sitara doesn't really have much competition locally, it really is a wonderful find for authentic Indian cuisine. I generally like the lunchtime special, a non-vegetarian thali. It is like a little smorgasbord of spicy treats with a sampling of curries, tandoori chicken, pakora, and naan and rice. Seasoning tends to run on the mild side though I imagine you could ask for some adjustments if you prefer a bolder flavor. I observed mostly empty plates returning to the bussing station so I'm speculating that most of the customers are enjoying their food as I did.

Service is unremarkable but competent. The host can be charming when he wants to be but don't hold your breath expecting it. Prices are inexpensive for the portion sizes. If you have a taste for something on the exotic side, I think Sitara fills the bill. Recommended."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant. I greatly enjoy all ethnic foods and was excited to see how many Indian restaurants there were in the CU area. We had tried every Indian restaurant in town and were left with no viable options. When this restaurant opened I half heartedly tried  it expecting more of the same. 

I was thrilled to discover and delicious and reasonably priced Indian restaurant in town. They also deliver!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in CU! The staff is always nice to me and I've been here enough times that they remember my order when I come in. There are so many dishes on the menu that I love, but I always come back to the chicken curry or chicken vendaloo. I'd say best Indian food I've had around here."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying that I'm Indian and have plenty of knowledge of Indian food and what it should taste like.

Sitara does it right. If you are looking for Indian food in Champaign there is no point of trying other restaurants. When we arrived it was busy, the wait was only about 10 minutes but we elected to sit in a booth since it was more spacious, I suggest you do the same it makes the experience much better. We ordered the shrimp pakora as an appetizer. It came out in about 15 minutes, there are 6 pieces total in an order. The appetizer was delicious. First, the batter they used to deep fry the shrimp had the perfect amount of spice to still be able to appreciate the flavor of the shrimp. The shrimp itself was fresh and had great flavor to it. The green chutney they gave was obviously homemade, and along with the shrimp, was delicious. 

As for my entree I had the lamb vindaloo. If you like real spicy food, not buffalo sauce spicy but REAL spice, you have to have a small chat with the server. I ordered my entree at a 5 level spice and was not disappointed. The sauce the lamb came in was full of spice and even made me sweat. The lamb was extremely tender, except for a few pieces that were a little fatty. There was only one thing wrong with the dish, vindaloo implies that there are vegetables in the dish. Traditionally these vegetables are onion and green pepper, and there are a few pieces of each in it. This dish gave me 2 pieces of broccoli. I was really shocked when I saw that. Why on earth would you put broccoli in an indian dish, and only 2 pieces of it?! I ordered garlic naan with my entree and was a little disappointed in it. There wasn't much presence of garlic. The naan was great and I recommend you order it, just don't upgrade to garlic naan. 

Apart from the broccoli and the lack of vegetables in my entree, the food was great. I highly recommend it. If you do go make sure you order King Fisher beer. It is an Indian beer and matches great with the spices."}
{"text":"I really enjoy number 57 lamp aloo, the one with potatoes. I used to have skeptical view towards the smell of Indian food but foods in this restaurant changed my mind: very delicious! Once begin eating, just cannot stop!
BTW, appetizer number6 is also amazing!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Indian food and I wasn't too impressed. Sitara has the best reviews on Yelp and I even ordered a lot of food to try and get a variety of different things.

I had the mixed grill which is Malai, Tikka, Garlic and Tandoori Chicken, and also comes with a lamb seekh kabob. I also got the Paneer Pakoras and the yellow Dol and rice which came with the meal.

Almost all of the chicken were in boneless chunks, with the exception of 2 wings, which I believe were the Tandoori. They were all pretty dry and almost similar to each other. Maybe this is because they are grilled rather than fried? Maybe I'm just used to heavily breaded chicken? I'm not sure. I did like the flavor of the Tikka(?) though, it was a little sweet and spicy. The lamb kabab was a little more flavorful and better in consistency but still wasn't as good as I'd hoped. 

Now, the rice that came with my entrée was surprisingly good for being just basmati rice. I was also given what felt like at least a pound of it, so no shortage there. The yellow Dol is not something I ever had before, but that I did like. It had a really interesting herbal flavor to it and can most closely be described as a soup.

I also got an appetizer of Paneer Pakoras which I'd say are similar to a mozzarella stick but not as greasy and heavy. These were good but by the time I had gotten around to eating them were inevitably cold. They were unusually tasty and came with 2 dipping sauces. One was a VERY spicy green sauce and I'm not sure about the other one, possibly a sweet berry sauce. Either way these sauces were delicious and I ended up dipping my chicken in them.

Overall the portion to price ratio was pretty good, although I wasn't very happy about how expensive my meal was considering I didn't much care for the chicken which was most of my dinner.

Delivery speed was really quick probably about 30 minutes but I actually think the delivery was the reason I didn't enjoy my food. Often times with delivery things sit around and get overcooked in the process. I think if I am ever to try Sitara, or any Indian food again, I will definitely go into the actual restaurant. From the pictures I've looked at, most Indian food looks very moist and saucy which is what I was hoping mine would be, but it was kind of dry."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and the service has improved markedly since the last time I was here two months ago!!! A must for any vegetarian eater in the area."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food in Champaign. But the service is definitely not good."}
{"text":"Highly overrated.  Service was non-existent, I didn't even know who was actually our waiter.  The chicken tikka masala was dry and bland with barely any spice, it tasted like chicken dumped in tomato soup.  The lamb curry was pretty tasty.  However, for roughly $10-12 per entree the portions were small and didn't even include naan, which you have to pay extra for.  Overall, I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"I happened to visit this restaurant with my uncle and his family. The ambience was pretty standard and there wasn't anything to gag about although the food that we ordered was very tasty. We ordered the Dal Makhani, Bhindi (Okra) Masala and Kadai Paneer. The Dal Makhani and Bhindi Masala reminded us of the way they are made in India although the Kadai Paneer wasn't that good. The paneer was as hard as possible and didnt feel fresh. The Tandoori roti (that we had ordered as a substitute for the Naan that comes free with every curry that was ordered) was so fresh and fully, cooked to crispiness in the outside and fluffiness in the inside. The gravy of Kadai Paneer was tasting like Vindaloo gravy. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"The food here is great! Full of flavor and very fresh. The restaurant is also very nice and clean and the staff are extremely professional. I'd go here instead of Bombay, the food is better and the prices are a lot cheaper!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what kind of drugs they're putting in their food but I am seriously addicted. I struggle not to eat there more than once a week. It's not just some of the best Indian/curry around, it's some of the best food of any genre I have found in C-U. I am so thankful my coworkers took me here as I am from Colorado and have been struggling to find good restaurants around the area. Highly recommend the chicken tikka masala with rice and naan. I haven't even ordered it with any spice but I hear good things. Check em out!"}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place out last night and I had a horrible experience, the staff was rude and inattentive they didn't bother to check on my party or offer refills had to flag down employees several times even though restaurant was not busy. The food was bland and left me with an upset stomach after I had left. If you want to try a place to get good Indian food go to Ambar India because sitara was just not up to par."}
{"text":"Love the decor and the food is even better to me than Bombay. Nice people working there. I love the lamb vindaloo for $9 at lunch."}
{"text":"The good: I used to settle for Bombay Indian until this place opened. I love their Baigan Bharta (veggie eggplant) and they have this naan with lamb that is always delicious. Service is pretty good. 

The bad: There isn't a ton of seating and I have gotten cold dishes sometimes. 

Overall, good food and decent prices (most entrees are $8-12)"}
{"text":"Welcome to my regular rotation, Sitara. I can't imagine another Indian restaurant in the area being better. 
I don't know why I waited so long to try here - the reviews are good, colleagues have recommended it, but for some reason I waited over a year. Got dinner to-go, and even tested out some items that might be questionable after the drive home. The naan was excellent (simple, but great), the veg app sampler was surprisingly good (not greasy, and the sauces added great zip), and the lamb vindaloo was still very tender. 
Now that I've tried out my \"tester\" dishes, I am ready to explore the menu. I'm hoping that they can bring a little more heat in the future."}
{"text":"Been going there  two a week now. We had Curry fish, Aloo Gobi, Lamb Saag today. Curry was very rich and savory without strong scents of coconut. Aloo was unbelievable with bright reddish tomato paste. Lamb Saag, the saag still surprises me every time and it's a full bowl of lamby lamb chops today."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food I have ever had! It's great for vegetarians. When people come out of town, this is the first place they want to go!"}
{"text":"The food here is always good. I'm not Indian so I can't speak to how authentic it is but I frequently see Indian people here so I think that's a good sign. Our go to favorite is the palaak paneer which is basically Indian creamed spinach and a good thing to try if you're apprehensive about Indian food. We usually try to get something spicy to balance out the creaminess of the spinach. The beer they have is also good. They only have Indian beer which all have super cliche names like Maja Raja, Taj Mahal, and Kingfisher. I was surprised to find out their beer is nothing like anything I've tasted. They're all lagers but they have an unexpected malty sweetness and they're  not super hoppy."}
{"text":"Never had been as great as some of the Indian food you can get from a bigger city or whatnot, but in the last few months it has been slipping."}
{"text":"I looooooooooove Indian food! For so many years, the only place I went in the CU area was Bombay on Green Street. Not long after Sitara opened, my mom took me for my birthday dinner when I was down from the city. So this review is a bit delayed :) Like I said I am always down for Indian, and I was happy to learn that a new restaurant had opened in downtown Urbana! 

I was very pleased with the service as well as the food. We came in later on a Wednesday night and were one of the only ones in the place. We shared a couple of entrees and were delighted with everything we ordered. 

I would definitely recommend Sitara to an Indian food veteran or novice! It is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Since I was coming down from Chicago for a friend's birthday dinner here; I read the reviews and anticipated a long wait. What I didn't anticipate was that the Thali plate option was only for lunch, so I was bummed I couldn't sample more for a dinner portion. I had samosas to kill the wait time and they were definitely delicious. Literally the only reason for the one star. I ordered chicken aloo for my entree and my chicken pieces were pretty big; but also not cooked through. I ate the potatoes from my dish because I was with a large party and already the last person to get my meal. Our meals came out staggered throughout about 6 drop offs along with constant clarification of what was still missing and about an hour wait time from order to table. Lastly, while packing up to leave we saw a cockroach climbing through the napkins in the napkin holder on the table next to us. I paid for my meal and tipped for service but will not be returning to this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"BEWARE of this place. They do not use a calculator for some reason to add up your bill and end up charging you more. Most people wont notice it but clearly they do it more than often. I am pretty sure its not a mistake because it has happened more than twice.
Also, while ordering they DO NOT specify if rice is extra or if they are trying to cross sell a product, they make it sound as if it comes with the entree. I would be careful of their practices. 
Finally, the quality of food is no different than bombay grill... its same old bombay grill type of food."}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian food in the Champaign-Urbana area.  Just writing this review makes me want to go back and get some more."}
{"text":"Veg appetizers are good but chicken biryani is no way near to the authentic Indian style. Avoid going for chicken biryani."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Indian place in town.  The food was hot and good, portions were a bit small as usual with most indian places but it was still plenty for leftovers with some naan & two entrees.  The vegetable korma is the best in town."}
{"text":"I was so terribly sorry to visit this place that I decided to leave a review about it's pathetic customer service and unpalatable food.

I have been here once before, and was disappointed with both the customer service and food quality. The server took forever to serve our order, and kept on messing with it. We ordered chicken and he brought something else, and so on for many other dishes. My friend was so disgusted that he left a big ZERO as the tip amount.

But for whatever reason, we decided to give it a second try, assuming that it was a bad day. But what are the odds that the same incidents happened during the second visit as well. Imagine what are the odds for that. The server was arrogant. The table was full, and there wasn't enough space to keep the incoming dishes on the table. So we requested him to keep them on the nearby table for the time being, since it was empty. He insisted that we keep it on our table only. I asked him to free up space on the table if he could, and he started to stack the dirty plates one upon the other on the table itself, not to collect them but to leave them there only. The food was so horrible that I had to leave my dinner unfinished. This time I left a ZERO dollars as the tip.

I am never going back to this place again."}
{"text":"First of all, the service was terrible. The waiter was very rude. He sat us at a dirty table-there was rice all over it. He never came to refill our drinks, he never came to ask if we needed anything. What little he did say to us was said with an attitude. He was disrespectful and seemed irritated. The restaurant was not very busy, yet we waited nearly an hour for our food to arrive. The food itself was not very good, either. Usually, I love Indian food. The food here was bland and had way too much ginger. There were huge chunks of it in everything we ordered, and there seemed to be no other flavor. When I ordered my food, I specifically requested that they make it spicy. However, there was absolutely no spice to it. Nothing tasted good. We agreed that we will not be returning, as every aspect of our experience here was absolutely dreadful.

If you are looking for good Indian food, I suggest going to Ambar India instead. They are always friendly and the food is always amazing. We thought we would try Sitara, and we ended up regretting it. We left feeling like we had wasted our time and money by eating at Sitara."}
{"text":"I should have written this review earlier but somehow forgot to do it. I went to Sitara for my last birthday. Considering the kind of Indian restaurants available in Champaign and me wanting to eat Indian food on my birthday, we did not have much choice. So we made a reservation at Sitara. We played safe and ordered veg assorted appetizer, Sitara mixed grill, lamb vindaloo and garlic naan. Appetizers were ok. Mixed grill was just bland, usually In India chicken or any other meat is well marinated before putting in tandoor or grill and the marinade usually has lots of herbs, yogurt, ginger, garlic and spices. I could not taste anything.  Lamb in vindaloo was chewy and tough, the flavor of curry was not balanced as well. Garlic naan tasted good but complimentary daal was again bland, it did not have smoky tempering which you get in Indian daal. Another Indian restaurant which doesn't serve authentic Indian food. 
I really wish they serve the kind of food which you get in India."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for a while. The service was very swift, for them to bring out our waters. We came on a Sunday so it wasn't actually very busy at the time we got there (around 12pm) but then it progressively got busier. We ordered mango lassi to start. It was so refreshing and delicious! Definitely get it too if you're planning to get something spicy. 

Per recommendation of our waiter, we got the chicken tikka masala (my friend had never tried Indian food and he suggested this was good to try). We also got the palak paneer which was paneer with spinach in a delicious sauce. We ordered naan and rice. Everything was so delicious and so filling! The paneer and spinach were perfectly seasoned and the chicken tikka masala was also very yummy. The only thing that somewhat bothered me was the temperature of the food...I like my food piping hot and it wasn't as hot as it could be. Maybe it was sitting out but food safety wise I hope it wasn't sitting out for too long...

Anyway, the food was delicious and we both really enjoyed our lunch!"}
{"text":"Lamb vendaloo, garlic chicken and tandoori chicken are worth trying. Naan is fine. Waiting time after ordering is about 20 to 25 minutes."}
{"text":"First time eating there and the food was very good. The lunch prices were very reasonable. I'm from New York and it's comparable to the Indian restaurants there."}
{"text":"After hearing from a friend that the Chef and manager who had previously worked at Bombay was working at this new restaurant, we had to go. My girlfriend and I had been going to Bombay almost every week for two years but noticed a gradual decline in the quality of the food. The food we were looking for was at Sitara.

The food was just as great as it was before. I always get the chicken korma 2x spicy while my girlfriend gets the (Sitara) chicken aloo also 2x spicy. The naan amazing and a must-have.

The only reason I am giving this a 4 is because the service is very dependent upon your server. Sometimes everything will be perfect, other times you'll be ignored from the time you get your food to when you get the check handed to you without a thing being said."}
{"text":"Year 1 Update
After having dinner here on Friday night I realize that this is likely the best Indian restaurant in town. It might also be the best ethnic restaurant in town as well. There was a significant wait time. We almost jump ship to go to another restaurant however we were quite excited that we stayed. One way of bypassing the line is sitting at the bar however for large parties this is an inconvenience. I ended up ordering the mixed grill it in multiple pieces of different protein with Indian herbs. I wish I went with a curry dish however this was still very flavorful and not dry. The dinner dishes come with naan or rice however we ordered more naan which we couldn't finish and had to take home. The prices are ridiculously cheap which is why I think this is a favorite restaurant for many people. As with any type of ethnic restaurants after you order you will still have to wait a while for your food to be prepared. The owners quite friendly and will come by and ask how you are doing. I really do enjoy this restaurant and I think I will be back again

Hidden deals: come check this out at lunchtime for their special lunch combos"}
{"text":"This place serves some terrific food. A good variety with varying spice levels - something for everyone. Very reasonably priced for the quality of food you get. The location is a bit small so be prepared to wait for table, but it's worth it. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We live in Chicago and have some pretty amazing Indian food up there. But since we come to Champaign/Urbana often I was so pumped to hear about this place opening.

We came in and we were literally the only other people in there which was kind of a bummer. There was also no real signage out front and no real decoration inside. I've been to that space when it was the pizza place, and then when it was Red Star before that and not much has changed besides the fact that there were Bollywood movies playing.

The service was fine, maybe a touch slow given that there was no one else there, but everyone was pleasant. The food was good too, perfectly spicy (and like spicy). I would surely come back. The only thing that worries me is the fact that they've failed health inspections. So what would've been a four star spot is now at two."}
{"text":"My favorite Indian restaurant in the CU. Everything tastes like home, like how it should be. Their kitchen consists of a simple stone oven and stovetop. The curry's served warm with warm (!) nan or rice. Core of the recipes stay true to Asian flavors, as well as a great assemble of spices.

Though the wait can be rather long at times, it's well worth it. Be sure to check the times beforehand as they have an afternoon break. 

Quick service, friendly owners, and most importantly great food. Do yourself a favor and order a mango lassi."}
