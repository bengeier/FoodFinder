{"text":"If you didn't know where to look, or were never taken here before, you could almost drive by Amicis. Tucked away in the far corner of this shopping plaza is this wonderful italian eatery. We thoroughly enjoyed the melt in your mouth veal, and shared a poached salmon that was tremendous. Don't forget to start with their version of pizza bread! 

Some great wine pairings are available, and saving room for dessert is a must here.  Also enjoyed authentic Italian liquers such as Sangsters and Stregga afer the meal. The owner Tony was hard to miss as he ensured an enjoyable evening by all.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"we ordered the house bruschetta to start (which came after we got our meals) our server told me the soup of the day was a potato, cheese and Jalapeño soup (figured I would give it a try) what I got was a beef stew kind of soup that came out about 2 seconds before our meals arrived on the table. We both had steak sandwiches done med/rare as it was the special, definitely nothing to brag about, we have had much better at pubs even. After we got our steaks we got our bruschetta which was also nothing special a small dish of diced tomatoes with a small cheese pizza is what it turned out to be. It was greasy and tasted nothing like what a good bruschetta should be. Needless to say it was an awful Italian dining experience and we won't be returning. I suggest going elsewhere for a good meal."}
{"text":"Would give a zero star if i could. Nothing consistant about this place. Food varies everytime ive been. Servers are terrible, bunch of kids that dont seem to care. Wont be back, which is sad because it was a great place the first few years it was open."}
{"text":"The girls who work there are always too busy chatting with each other, they are slow and don't listen. Every single time we made an order there it is wrong !!!! 
The last 3 times we have had the wrong order for take out, food was missed they \"forgot\" to make and so we waited so that the missed order for somebody at our house and they still made us pay for it.  Their pizza is good but expensive.  The service absolutely sucks.."}
{"text":"Best kept secret of the 'burbs.  I probably shouldn't share this restaurant with you because it means more people will go...but here goes. 

We lived in our neighborhood for years before we tried Amici for the first time. Now we're kicking ourselves for not going sooner. I have to say though, we've made up for lost time.

One word: PIzza. If it's your first time, don't even look at the rest of the menu. Their pizza is a must. Plus, their chose for house wine is wonderful and reasonably priced. If you go on one of the days where they have 2-for-1 pizza or pasta, it makes for a delicious, inexpensive night out, e.g. $35 plus tip for two including drinks.  Even when there are no specials, the prices are reasonable.

My only complaint is they close early during the winter. Don't go by at 10pm on a Friday and expect to get in - they are closing down by then. 

The atmosphere is casual and friendly, albeit dated but that's part of the charm.  The owner often makes the rounds to the tables to say hi and ask how the food is tasting. The waiters are equally friendly and the whole vibe feels like 'Cheers' - where everyone knows your name.

I highly recommend a visit or two...or ten."}
{"text":"I came here based off a recommendation from a co-worker, and I can see why she's a fan! I have to start by saying that the service was great and the staff were very friendly, and most importantly, the food was fresh, delicious, and at a fair price.  It really felt like home-cooked (the good kind!) Italian meals--something along the lines of being invited to a big dinner at an Italian household.  It's nothing uproariously fancy, but the food's really satisfying, tasty, and something you'll enjoy savouring over conversation with everyone around the table.
On my last visit, my friend and I enjoyed our pastas immensely, and what's more, we were surprised when just a minute after we ordered, we were given complimentary bread with a great, soft garlic butter spread, as well as bruschetta on the house--not sure if that's a thing they often do, but hey, free food! The fact that the bread was warm and soft, plus the tomatoes on the bruschetta tasted really fresh, was something to appreciate even more.

The only bit of constructive criticism I can give this place has to do with some wait time issues--admittedly it was quite empty when I went, but there could be more staff on the floor later into dinner service.  Instead of just having one staff member, as was the case on my last visit, two people might be ideal, just so any customers who are ready for the bill or need to order/ask for a little something extra can be attended to quickly.  We actually waited for about twenty-five minutes between receiving the bill and paying, not because we weren't ready, but because a new table had been seated and required the waitress' attention for quite a while.  We weren't in a hurry, but it was certainly something we took note of.  If the problem persists here, you may want to pay right away or really grab a chance to catch someone's attention when they happen to pop out from the back room.  The staff tend to disappear if someone pops in to pick up their take-out, too, which is understandable, but could be a problem if you're raring to leave after a while.

The place is a bit dim inside and is really easy to miss within the plaza, but do not pass it up if you want some fresh, satisfying Italian food in a cozier atmosphere.  Personally, I will be back for sure! :)"}
{"text":"Great food, I just feel the service could be a little quicker."}
{"text":"I will start by saying that everyones food was very flavorful.  I ordered the Canneloni (sp?) And my wife had the Penne Arabiata and both were very good.   Ordered chicken fingers and fries for our son, the fries were very salty, especially for a kid.   Our server was phenomenal, in fact we were table touched by the manager and one of the hosts during our visit, as well as our server who seemed to have perfect timing throughout.  My only major complaint, and the only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars is that the high chair was very dirty.  We removed the tray and sat him right up to the table so it really wasnt a huge deal, but it was visibly quite dirty.  Beyond that we had a great experience tonight.   I regret that I dont have the name of the server to thank as she did a fantastic job."}
{"text":"Wow... must be new ownership. They just lost a long time customer. Tried the service again after my last disappointment. My address-pizza-panzerotti, not that difficult. After over 10 min, and being put on hold for the 4th time, speaking to two different people, I hung up. By the time they called me back 5 min, I had ordered from Palermo. Seems they have mastered the art of taking an order.
Truly poor service."}
{"text":"We were at amici tonight for 2 for 1 pizza. We arrived at 8 pm, ordered two large pizzas. It wasn't very busy but we were told that yhey rN out of dough for larhe pizzas we have the option of ordering small or medium only. Lol really? I sId coukdnt they take two small dough balls and mix it together for 0ne larhe pizza? It cant be rocket science? The pizza was good but it's abit ridiculous on 2 got 1 pizza night to supposedly run out of dough for larhe pizzas only. It makes me wonder how they stay open when they make up lame excuses. The service was good, our waitress was sweet. It was great pizza but the experience overall was weird."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews here I decided to visit Amici's with my 5 year old son for a boys night out.  Let me start off that friends of the owner must of been seeding Yelp because it just plain sucked.

Waiter was non existent. Food took forever to come out and when it did it was either tasteless (mine) or cold (my sons). It was loud - our table was tiny and cramped, and did I mention the lousy waiters?  Water was filled once the hour we were there for a 'quick bite' before our movie and THEN forgot my sons drink, forgot our dessert, but of course charged (tried to before I reminded he forgot to deliver).  Perhaps we just had a lousy waiter, but throw in meals that left a lot to be desired for taste and presentation, and OVERPRICED for the type of restaurant it is, you'd leave like me going That's $50 and one hour of my life gone that I want back.

Either way, it was a poor restaurant, and avoid taking kids if you really insist on going."}
{"text":"If only there was a way to provide a negative rating, I would definitely be doing just that.  This rating is purely based on service....because we never had a chance to taste their food.
We went in, sat down, ordered, waited....people came, sat down, ate, left.  After an hour and fifteen minutes, we got a hold of a server, as we hadn't seen ours after we go our drinks.  We requested bread so that the toddler we were with could have a bite to eat. She came back advising that they were baking and would be ready in a few minutes.  Still our server was not in sight.  She finally shows up confirming our order? and tells us she forgot the last item we ordered for the child; and we ordered his meal in between our order...it took her AN HOUR AND A HALF to realize this?!?!  She just turned around and walked away after telling us that. I called her back and said don't worry about it.  She didn't ask questions, just continued walking away.  She didn't need ask if we wanted the other meals that she claimed have already been made, or any clarification.  She most likely didn't put in any of our order.  No one talked to us or made an attempt to fix anything.  What a mess!
The restaurant wasn't even busy...so there is no excuse. If you're trying to promote your restaurant by providing a 2-for-1 pasta night, it's not going to work if your servers don't even put in the order."}
{"text":"This is a cute place tucked away in the city's NW. The service was good, the ambiance was okay, and the portion sizes were quite large. The bread and butter that they provide every table was nice especially because our food took some time. It was understandable though as they were quite busy at the time. The food was just alright, the food ranged from overly salty(lasagna) to being more on the bland side (mushroom risotto).  It's not my favorite Italian place in the city, far from it actually. There are more Italian restaurants in the surrounding area that serve far better food for comparable prices."}
{"text":"Omg!! So much hype about this place & the food I had was simply disgusting!!
The place was super busy so the food, even appetizers took an hour to get to the table!
The bruschetta was a cheese pizza with tomatoes on the side. Then as for the veal...the most disgusting veal I've ever had! I don't recommend it!"}
{"text":"Always a treat to eat at Amici. Very busy with excellent service (noticed some of the same staff from pervious visits). I've tried several different dishes over the years and the Manicotti was cheesy delicious. Bread before dinner is great too."}
{"text":"We live in the Northwest.  The Northwest SUCKS for decent restaurants.  My in laws were coming into town so we called our \"go to\" restaurant, Rea's.  They were closed for a private party.  Doh!  With one kid with a shellfish allergy and one person with a somewhat iffy stomach, it was hard to find somewhere to go.  There were 7 of us so we NEEDED reservations.  

Enter Amici Grill.  I knew I had seen the sign on Country Hills but I could not remember the names.  I mapped it on Yelp & next thing you know we had reservations.  We were a little worried since we've had such bad luck with Northwest restaurants but we were very happy with our experience here.  The service was great, the food was great and it was super family friendly.  

Definitely get the bread when you eat here!  It comes out piping hot with garlic butter.  Yum!  We will be back on Monday night for 2 for 1 pizza.  This is one of the best kept NW secrets!"}
{"text":"exceptional service, good portion sizes, friendly owner, tasty food. nice to visit anytime"}
{"text":"I was out to Amici's for supper with some friends who come here quite often. I now know why. This restaurant has a homey feel and the food is like your Italian grandma would make. It was busy but that didn't stop our server from paying attention to us. She did a great job keeping us supplied with wine and of course, the hot bread with garlic butter. 

The menu has a great variety. We all ordered pasta dishes. Two of my friends had the jambalaya with extra jalapenos. Our food came out in good time and WOW the bowls were HUGE! The pasta was totally heaped up. There was enough in my bowl for 2 meals and I ended up taking some home with me. I had the cheese ravioli with meat sauce. I think this was the best ravioli I've ever had. The ravioli was tender and tasty. The rosy tomato sauce was so flavorful, garlicky and had just a hint of heat to it. Not your plain jane kinda pasta sauce here. There was also a good heaping of meat in it. Yes this was a great choice. And from what everyone at the table was saying, their meals were pretty amazing too. 

I almost didn't want to post a review here because now that I've discovered Amici's I want to keep this hidden gem all to myself. It's authentic Italian food with great service. I can't wait to go back and try the pizza."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever and we used to go all the time but over the course of the years the food quality has slipped and the prices are quite expensive for the quality of food. Service is generally good but again, depends on the day. Definitely needs a revamp of menu and decor."}
{"text":"SLOW servers/hostesses that seem like they do not know what they are doing and wishing they were elsewhere. Terrible decor on walls and the floor is just nasty like a bare basement floor where the carpet had been pulled up. In desperate need of some hardwood. Booths not clean, glasses and bread dishes had to be returned as they were dirty. Pasta bland, dried pasta overcooked, this dish had to be returned to kitchen, no manager came by to amend any isssues. Just a bunch of clueless 16 year olds running around, understaffed and not knowing their duties or the food that they serve IE our waitress did not know what pasta was served fresh or dried.. Whaat? That is a basic question about the main food???  When my dish had to be returned I was told that a manager she had to talk to about this was busy and by the time I got a replacement meal, I was eating alone, my partner had finished. Sad!

And why is there a quesadilla on the menu at an Italian eatery?
 
Pluses:
The gnocchi was good with the Bolognese sauce and the food was served hot. The little checked tableloths on the tables are very cute. That is about it.

Mon night is pizza night (2 for 1) so the place was moderately busy and be aware that this place is quite kid friendly. Not intended for a romantic date night!
Will not return and would not recommend. Given our experience, someone should have taken charge and made sure we left with not such a negative impression for our first time here.

Ordered tonight was the gnocchi and seafood fettuccine alfredo (triple ick), 1 water, 1 beer. 

TIP to our waitress who offered just to dump meat sauce onto my awful dish to eliminate some of the blandness.... really???  Um, no bad suggestion.
Wish I could have given you a tip tonight..."}
{"text":"Food is average overall. Overpriced for what you get. Bread bar is great but your paying for more than that. There are other places in town worth going to"}
{"text":"My parents brought me here as it has been a recent discovery that they are now digging. I didn't even know this place was there kind of tucked into the back of the complex. 

Amici's is a very large space that would likely do well for groups which is filling since Amici translates to Friends.  They also seem to have a booming takeout service. 

Servers were all very polite and professional.   The dining room is clean and comfortable.  Amici's isn't anything too fancy acceptable for families, business or couples. 

We ordered bruschetta to share which was pretty tasty (it had a bit of a bite to it) and I ordered quattro formaggi penne which was ok but that's likely more about me as I'm not usually a fan of heavy cream sauce and I picked it anyway. 

Everyone else loved what they got which leads me to believe I should have chosen a dish I more classically love.  

I'm not often around Amici's but I would return for another try next time i'm out that way."}
{"text":"Everything is A-Okay, indeed!

I have been to Amici twice in one week-- mainly because I wanted to avoid franchises, which can be a challenge in the suburbs, and two, I wanted to scope out the scene for Mother's Day. 

It is as you would expect it to be-- the staff are members of the family. The dishes taste like they're home-made and the décor was kitchy in an Italian motif. 

The food was pretty good and the prices are between $13-30 for entrees. I had a chicken and rice dish (I can't remember the Italian name) and it was really good. I was craving a homemade meal-- but y'know? didn't want to cook one myself, so this was a perfect alternative. 

The chicken was savory-- and huge! I'm not sure if it was two chicken breasts-- tenderized or one really huge bird! The rice and roasted veggies were filling, in fact, my belly was full because I ate  the veggies and the rice rather than the chicken.

Now, the real reason why I went back to Amici was for the desserts! Oh my lordt!! I ate the caramel chocolate cake both times. It's rich, chocolatey and not overtly sweet. IT. IS. HEAVENLY. It's totally worth not having a beach body for!  And there are gluten-free dessert options too."}
{"text":"Friday night with a group of 8. Made reservations. Table was set up for our arrival. Greeted and seated with only 2 menus and hostess left. Waited 25 min while other tables were seated and taken care of before retuning to the hostess to request service and water. Dismissive apology but at least water provided and order taken. Service was friendly but treated like nothing had happened. 

Complimentary warm bread with whipped herbed butter provided. Calamari appetizer arrived 10 min after ordering and cooked well. Remainder of meal arrived just under an hour after ordering. Tried everything from pizza to pasta to veal. Overall table concensus was descent though salty food, but overpriced.

Ambience is loud and busy. Good for a boisterous group or families but difficult to have a conversation. 

Honestly this feels like a family restaurant trying to be upscale by bumping up prices. Unfortunately the only competition are chains like Boston Pizza and Applebee's which aren't exactly upscale. For similar food for way more value, try Palermo's down the road."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. The pizza here is amazing with the option to even create your own. 
The restaurant is also in a good location in north Calgary."}
{"text":"It's ok. It's kind of a family style neighborhood place without the charm. Definitely not upscale. The decor is a little dated and the floors create a cold ambiance.  It was relatively busy on a Friday night, so it seems to be popular. In my opinion, the menu is too big for anything to be of excellent quality. We ordered the bruschetta and salsiccia (sp?). The bruschetta is good, easy to eat as the tomato soaks into the bread and makes each bite separate well from the bread. Four slices for 7.50. The pasta was basically penne pasta with cut up sausages. Nothing I couldn't make at home. Service is slow and inattentive.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Not an expert in Italian food but I really like the food here. Taste fresh and good.

I've only been inside to have dinner once it was alright just felt outdated but the food is good. The calamari, bruschetta, gnocchi bolognese is great and I would recommend that combination to anybody."}
{"text":"Husband and I live within walking distance and we have been coming here to eat since our move to Calgary in February.  Amici's is almost always busy, depending on the amount of people eating.  Service is better before dinner rush that begins about 6:00pm, so if you have a special occasion book a reservation in advance!  We love the Calamari, which is made both deep fried or rabbiata style (cooked in marinara sauce).  I prefer authentic Italian food since I'm part Sicilian.  The ambiance and decor is rustic.  Overall it has been as close as the \"old country\" style of cooking that my Grandma made back home.  Amore"}
