{"text":"Excellent food & wonderful people! I'm Peruvian and grew up eating this cuisine. Now that I'm vegetarian, I'm delighted by the wonderful non-meat dishes the chef has cooked up. Definitely my favorite Peruvian restaurant so far."}
{"text":"Not bad Tumi, not bad at all. This place is completely unassuming. Its pretty bare, and was empty when I came in. Looks like an old takeout pizza place or something. My waiter was the guy sitting at the table next to me watching soccer...and he'd sit back down between picking up my food, and getting my order. Casual? Yeah, very. The food however is pretty solid. They have a wide selection of ceviches, and a mild obsession with corn. (Special big kernel peruvian corn, as i'm told..which had  a  less sweet and mealier texture it seemed to me.) I also had the Chicha Morada, which was a sweet purple drink purportedly made from the same corn. All in all, not neccesarily \"fine dining\" from any sense of the term I've ever known...but certainly worth the money. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon, I tried this place out with a friend.  Having no experience with Peruvian food, I thought that it was very flavorful and delicious; although simple. The atmosphere was ok, but the service was incredible and you could tell that it was a family owned business and they took great pride in their food and service."}
{"text":"I enjoyed everything about this restaurant. Interesting flavors, NEW experiences and beautiful presentation. I've never seen corn as big as they serve here! Was definitely fun dining here. You have to bring your appetite tho because the dishes served are extremely filling. I don't want to say it's because it's \"heavy\" because that's not it. Foods like plantains, potatoes, and sauces made with nuts all fill you up nicely and keep you satiated for half the day. I also very much enjoyed the purple corn drink served. If you want a fun and satisfying meal, try it. I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always very welcoming. Best Authentic Peruvian food, with the best and nicest chef!"}
{"text":"Phoenix really lacks a bunch of great Peruvian restaurants. This is the only one, surprisingly, in the East Valley and is solid. We go often. I tend to get the fish ceviche which has perfect amount of kick and great flavor always fresh served with Peruvian corn and sweet potato. I like that they include a lot of juice, also known as 'leche de tigre\", in the ceviche. Make sure you get a spoon to get to all of the juice. I also always get the lomo saltado which is very good. We also like getting the pollo a la brasa with yucca and rice. The red sauce is very good. You can also get some aji and mayonnaise sauce on the side for the yucca. We have also had aji de Gallina which is also good.   The place is somewhat a dive but shouldn't be. If it were in a nicer strip mall and if it were nicer finished I think they would get more attention.   I highly recommend people eat here and try a variety of dishes."}
{"text":"My Peruvian boyfriend and I have tried other Peruvian restaurants in the valley.   This is the best and he says it is authentic.   I highly recommend it.   The Lomo Saltado is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  Really good, and different food.  I like my kids experiencing foods from other cutures.   The waitress was very polite and super friendly!!! If you want something not run of the mill this is your place!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! All the meals are prepared upon order and the staff is very friendly. You can quickly see their cooking staff is passionate about cooking the best meal for each guest.   We have had the Lomo Slatado, Green Spaghetti and Lomo al Caballo. All three of the plates have left us amazed with great taste!  It's rare to have a small restaurant with so much personality and uniqueness in the Phoenix area, Tumi is one of them...it's a must stop."}
{"text":"It's been quite a while since I went here for the first time, and I had decided to try this place because the drive to my favorite, El Chullo is long. Just getting around to give it a review, but I will never ever even attempt to go there again. It was about an hour and a half prior to closing, and the door was locked. There were people in there eating. The waitress looked at me and shook her head no at me.  I pointed to the door, where the hours were printed, and at the same moment, out came the cook from the back and with no smile or verbal explanation, also shook his head no. Not the way you do business. So I know a lot of Peruvian people and I mentioned this impolite experience. They told me that, there, the fish in the ceviche, is cut in kind of larger pieces and doesn't taste nearly as good as my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale called El Chullo. Soooo , I will continue to make the well worth it drive to Scottsdale. I will never question it again because it's worth it the best restaurant Peruvian style in the valley!  So, eat at EL Chullo.  You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"We decided to not cook tonight and instead treat ourselves to a great Peruvian feast. It was disappointing to see how things changed. I even asked the waiter if there was new management at the restaurant.  My lomo saltado lacked flavors, with a very small portion of rice and where were the tomatoes? My wife ordered her favorite ceviche mixto. Tonight the portion was extra small and poorly served. When the waiter asked if everything was good? My wife told him the portion is smaller than the usual. He responded that the plate is larger and deeper than before. Not so because I have pictures of the way it use to be served comparing to what it looked like today."}
{"text":"This is the most amazing Peruvian spot I have ever had. The Pescado a lo Macho is hands down the best seafood dish I've had in the last 12 months. Visiting from out of town, and come here every quarter. Will come back to Tami as often as possible. EPIC!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a latin kick.  The chicken is good. The little corn nut things are delicious. And the lomo saltado is great. More green sauce please!"}
{"text":"My whole family had moved to Arizona and this was one of the restaurants that we wanted to try out... when we first tried everything was good the food and the great service, but this last time the food was fair and the service was bad it felt as if they were rushing us out! I personally felt as if it was different. My family and I were disappointed."}
{"text":"When I heard that the chef from Contigu Peru (now closed) was offering his delicious food here, I was super excited to go.  The dining room is very tiny but they graciously had set aside several tables for our group of about 10-12 as they we expecting us.  Now that being said, I really did feel as if we took up half the restaurant. Initially I was worried that service would be slow considering the size of our group and since I had only noticed one person running the front of the house but that was not the case.   I ordered the Cau Cau, which is the cow tripe served with potatoes.  I was hesitant on trying something new but I found it to be very good. And how could I forget to mention the Chicha Morada, which is the purple corn drink.  I could drink that all day, every day!  My only disappointment was the dessert that I was excited about trying (Alfajores--sweet biscuits) was not available so I had to settle for another option (Picarones-donuts) which was good  All in all, I really enjoyed the food here and will be back."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian restaurant in the Valley...fresh and delicious food always, great service everybody is so friendly there. I highly recommend this place, I love their Lomo Saltado, Jalea, pollo a la brasa, ceviche, arroz con mariscos etc. oh and if you go there don't forget to try their Home made churros yummmmmm exquisite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh and Sr. Oscar always hooks it up =), love it. He is one great Peruvian Chef"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I have been here twice so far, and both times have been fantastic. Food is extremely fresh tasting and cooked with skill. The small grievance I have is that the second time I went, they were out of the roast chicken I really wanted to try. However, it's worth mentioning I went at 8 on a wednesday. Considering that, I don't hold too much against them. So I had the paella instead, and am glad I did. It says \"good for two\" on the menu, but I ate the whole thing myself. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food filled with such great flavor!! I love coming here when I'm in the mood for good Peruvian food!"}
{"text":"Everything was fabulous.  The beef was tender and spiced nicely. I am not a rice fan, but it was also very tasty.  We are planning to go back soon!"}
{"text":"We love this place, my husband and I go quite often. My husband lived in Peru for sometime and is constantly craving good Peruvian food!"}
{"text":"This place has been awesome for a long time! But recently the famous rotisserie chicken has been lacking i don't know if there is a new chef or if they are cutting back on ingredients to save money but the stuff is just not the same!! Which is sad because it is the most amazing thing I have tasted. I will keep going hoping that they will get back to the magic of old."}
{"text":"Wow. This place use to be good when it was a small restaurant, now it's HORRIBLE at their new location. Let me list all the terrible service/hiccups that my family and my mom went through on Mother's Day.  1. It was completely unorganized. We had two to three different servers throughout our entire meal.  2. We ordered a pitcher for five and waters. They only brought four cups and only two cups of water. We requested for an extra glass and we waited 20-30 minutes and we still didn't receive a cup. We had to request a second time. We also had to request for straws which they had on them in their waist pocket the whole time. 3. At this point they only had 8 tables and three servers. We placed our orders and it was 4 entrees one of them being a kids meal. It took more than 1 and a half hours for two of us to get our meal and it took even longer for my older brother to get his meal.  4. My older brother had to request for his food after everyone else had already received their food and started eating. When he received his food (which was a meat dish) it was mainly fries and hardly any meat. The waitress didn't even apologies and they didn't even offer to compensate in any way. 5. My youngest brother requested a cup of water and it took him two requests for him to finally get a cup of water.  6. We never received refills of anything. Not even water. Also only two of us out of five had cups of water because they didn't bring anyone else water when we requested them.  7. They never offered us an explanation for any of the delays or an apology for any of the hiccups. We're not hard to please and I'm not expecting perfection but we didn't even receive sub-par service. All I'm asking is a considerate service. If there's issues with our food, then communicate it to your customers. Be considerate.  8. Additionally people that came in 30-45 minutes after us received their food before us.   Only good things were the music and the food was still warm.  BUT IT ISN'T WORTH THE WAIT OR THE HASSLE. AS LONG AS THEY ARE AT THEIR NEW LOCATION I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK."}
{"text":"Very disappointed of this place I won't recommend any more, last time we were there they took forever to give the check, they got busy and didn't know what to do, we order some to go and they forget about it, we notified the owner and he didn't even apologized to us instead he charged us what we order to go without even giving us tbe food. VERY bad service, my family always wanted to come with us but I will never take them to this place."}
{"text":"Small venue, but excellent food!   The service was top notch!   It was worth the wait to be seated with a party of 8.     I had the pollo slatado, and my wife had the Lomo slatado..   Seasoning was not too spicy.  Just enough to bring out the flavor in the the food when combined with the vegetables and fries. PAUL R."}
{"text":"Today I went to celebrate with my family the end of my kids' finals. I used to love this Peruvian restaurant, but not anymore. I agree with the previous comment that the portions are smaller, not the same that used to be, and it doesn't taste the same. Today I asked the waiter about a promotion on Groupon where you pay $15 and you get $25 worth of food for 2 people. The waiter replied, \"Oh, that promo is for big parties only, and it is Tuesday through Thursday,\" I told him I am completely sure it was Tuesday through Friday, and it is $25 worth of food for $15 for two people not just for big parties. He said that the boss has changed the days, and nowit  is Tuesday through Thursday. He told me you have to buy it, I said ok I will, but my phone was having problems with groupon's website. Also they used to have lunch specials, I asked the waiter about those specials, and he told me that people order for the menu, not lunch specials. I think that the waiter has a bad attitude, because we had a problem with him at a similar restaurant. At the end he said here is your bill, and here is the space for my tip, our bill was $55 and I tip him $5 for his bad customer service. I love Tumi's, because the owner used to cook, but this time the owner wasn't cooking. Somebody else was cooking and you can tell the difference. I'm not coming back to this restaurant, but it used to be my favorite restaurant. Not anymore, I will try a different Peruvian restaurant."}
{"text":"I am Peruvian and love to go to Tumi.  The food is great and prepared just like back home.  Chef Oscar does a great job, best Peruvian food in Phoenix per my humble opinion.  I love ordering the causa rellena and lomo saltado with an Inca Kola !"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the food here! 5 stars for the food having wonderful flavors!  I had to rate down due to the service being slow and we also killed a roach on the wall."}
{"text":"Visiting from California. Great food, awesome service. And you can bring your own beer. Loved the seafood special. The other courses looked good too. Will be back."}
{"text":"My experience was terrible! The temperature in the dining area was 89 degrees! When we asked them to turn the air conditioning higher they gave us attitude! They said the reason that it was so hot was because it was hot outside. Last time I checked I thought the point of air conditioning was to make it cooler inside! Never eating here again!"}
{"text":"I didn't know anything at all about Peruvian food, but my sense of adventure guided me through the door.  The term \"hole-in-the-wall\" accurately describes this place, as it's in a dusty little strip mall that you'd drive past and never pay attention to.  The interior is brightly painted and clean, but nothing special, aside from a cool mural on the wall.  Soccer was playing on all the TVs, and the cooks in the back were cheering loudly.  I almost felt like I was in Peru.   The food is a bit pricier than I expected.  The appetizers average at $8 each, and the entrees about $15 or so.  The Pollo a la Brasa, \"made of 12 spices based on an ancient Kankacho Andino recipe\", sounded delicious so I went for it.  At $10.95, a whole rotisserie chicken including choice of two sides (french fries, rice, beans or salad) and some sauces on the side was a pretty good deal.  I really enjoyed the beans...savory and porky in flavor...and the plain looking rice was perfectly cooked and yummy.  Overall it was a great meal, so I'll be back to try something new."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. The atmosphere was a little spartan. Service was friendly, though a bit slow (it's a hang-out-all-evening type of place). But the food was excellent."}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Peruvian food, or have never tried it but like other Latin cuisines, you must try Tumi. Food was fantastic, I had their version of a Paella (spicy with Tostones/Yucca) and all the seafood you would expect. The waitress was helpful, friendly and provided good suggestions for my order. A little gem in Chandler."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are no experts in Peruvian cuisine, but Tumi's food was outstanding.  We had the Choclo con Queso as an appetizer (seriously, try it - it's a large-kernel Andean corn, way different than our corn, but we really liked it after a few bites).  My girlfriend had the Pollo Saltado and I has the Saltado Tumi.  Perfectly cooked and SO delicious, both of them.  It's a tiny dining room, far from fancy ambience, but the prices are fantastic for such good food in such ample portions.  The service was polite and not pushy.  I'm craving more even as I type this - we'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but usually the ones with the best food.   So the taste of the lomo saltado is good but the meat was tuff and they were very stingy with it too . They also gave me a small portion of fries. I had to stop at Wendy's for extra which is not ideal. Next time I'll try a different place."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Just like the food I had in Piura years ago.  Wife had Saltado de Mariscos and I had the Lomo. Both were fantastic.  Try the papas a la huacaina, they are remarkable."}
{"text":"Neither my husband or I had every had Peruvian food before but decided to give it a try on Saturday night.  The food was fantastic - I'm adding going to Peru to my bucket list - but they only had one server for the whole restaurant.  We were hoping to get some descriptions of the food and recommendations since we weren't familiar with it, but the waitress was spread so thin and so flustered we gave up on any conversation.  We had to wave her down when we needed napkins, again when we needed our drinks refilled, and again when we wanted the check.  Normally we would have ordered appetizers and deserts, but it was just too much effort, so we stuck to just pointing at one item on the menu.  If we lived closer, I would get takeout, as we really enjoyed our food, but eating here was just too stressful and lacked the personal touch that I was expecting."}
{"text":"We got the lomo Saltado and ceviche. It was great! I can't wait to go back! It was a cute little mom and pop shop. Staff was friendly, place was clean."}
{"text":"Found this place when having a taste for Peruvian food, and another restaurant had to close early due to an emergency. Was sad to find them out of chicha morada, but the lomo saltado was delicious! Service was fast and friendly, and I will definitely visit this spot again."}
{"text":"This place is infested with roaches... I was eating there with my wife and a roach crawled on the table... I looked down and there were at least two more running on the floor...  never went back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a fish dish to go.  It was piping hot when I got home and had outstanding flavor.  The rice had excellent flavor too.  The food far exceeded my expectations.  The owner and staff made me feel very welcome, and took great pride in their food and Peruvian heritage, which made the food taste even better somehow.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Coming from Miami my expectations for Peruvian food are pretty high. Tumi is pretty decent as far as what we have here in the desert. Food was good, service was good too. Some things are a bit over priced but over all it's good. Try lomo saltado or jalea mixta those are always a must. Also some ceviche and papa a la huancaina!"}
{"text":"This place moved to this location. All of the reviews disappeared from the other location. The food is very authentic peruvian food. Recommend the Lomo saltado or the Seco de Carne. Or any seafood dish. Also try one of the many unique appetizers. My mom was Peruvian,  so  I crave this food."}
{"text":"The owner chased me outside because I overlooked 24 cents which I didn't mind but then he demanded a tip which I already had gave the waitress and he was very rude"}
{"text":"We had the ceviche mixto, seco res, and papa rellena as an appetizer. Overall, we had a great experience. We were introduced to new food and flavors, service was timely, and we will come back again."}
{"text":"After hearing so many good things about this place my mom and I made the drive to come out here. My moms Peruvian friend brought her here a couple of months back and my mom said that I had to come try for myself.   It's a small family style atmosphere, however the service was awful. I'm not from South America and not familiar with many of the selections and when we asked the waitress what she would recommend she stated that most people know what they want when they come there.   I decided to go on yelp and see the options that were available based on pics since my mom didn't remember what she had the last time she came. We ordered the ceviche which was great and the chicha morada drink was very good as well. We ordered the seafood Jalea which looked amazing and grand. However was completely smothered in salt, so salty it was inedible. The shrimp was also not cleaned and prepared properly. So disappointing because the portion was generous and it looked divine. We then ordered the pesto pasta which was awful as the Pasta and steak was overcooked and very bland. I was beyond disappointed and couldn't believe the lack of service. Our waitress sat in a corner and ate and we had to flag her down just to get refills of water. I advised our waitress of the quality of food and she stated that was how it was prepared and served.   I decided to order dessert because I am a huge fan of Alfajores, let me say the order of 2 Alfajores were PERFECTION! That's the only part of the entire meal that was amazing. The buttery shortbread style cookie (it's made out of maizena cornstarch) and cajeta were just perfect together. That is the only reason I would ever come back because they were that good. I would give one star for lack of service and quality of food for the price we paid but I am giving 2 for the amazing Alfajores. I probably won't be coming back though, too far and pricey for lack of service and quality of food."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I have never experienced such bad service as I have just had at this restaurant. We waited over an hour for our meal to come and it never came. We kept being told it will be out in 5 minutes and it never came . Come on. We ended up leaving without ever getting our food. There was only 3 other tables full so it sure wasn't because they were busy ( I understand now why this restaurant is always empty ) it's unfortunate as we always want to support smaller individually owned restaurants but I would of died starving waiting for that meal. Calling yourself a fine restaurant not only means for the food but also the service . Tumi and the staff at Tumi there is nothing fine about you or your service. I can not comment on the food as we never got it."}
{"text":"I travelled through Peru this summer and fell in love with the food. I was excited to find a Peruvian restaurant so close to my home. This was a quaint restaurant with a good selection of food. The service was good and the food as excellent. The food tasted excellent and they had a good selection. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A definite fan and will definitely come back, soon! My husband went to Peru last month and had a craving for Peruvian food. So he googled Peruvian restaurants and lo and behold this little gem popped up. So we decided to give it a try and boy, was it worth it! The place is a quaint little place, nice and clean. Service was personable and quick. Food was outstanding! Everything was just full of flavor! The spices, the sauce, the texture, it was delicious. The portions are a good size too, we left there stuffed. We wanted Flan so badly for dessert we ended up taking it to-go instead. Totally worth it when you're belly is ready for more! If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, Tumi serves up fresh, delicious food to satisfy any stomach! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first Peruvian food experience.  Everything was excellent except the roast chicken.  It lacked flavor.  I would stick to the specialty menu and appetizer.  Food and presentation was very nice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Peruvian spot! Love the food, service and family atmosphere. I usually get the pollo saltado or the Peruvian fried rice, delicious every time. I would highly recommend checking out this place, great way to support local business."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time and it was my first time eating Peruvian food. The establishment was quaint and it reminded me of home and comfort. The staff was very friendly and eager to please. For this being our first time we truly enjoyed the food and the flavors where so on point. I am looking forward to trying more of the items on their menu. Yummy :)"}
{"text":"It was our first time in a Peruvian restaurant, and found it because of a Groupon deal. Our guy server was awesome. We asked for recommendations on what to eat since it was our first time eating Peruvian cuisine and he gave his honest opinion (he's funny too!). Food was delicious.   We had the anticuchos for appetizer, which is beef heart. It's our first time eating beef heart. I think the taste is like a cross between regular beef meat and a bit of liver. We liked it, especially when you put the spicy sauce on it. My wife had the Ceviche de Camarones and she loved it. I had the Lomo Saltado. The flavor is awesome! The beef is a bit tough, not too bad though. Maybe next time, I will add the option to make it a sirloin for additional $5. We had Caramel Flan for dessert and it's a big serving.   The place was busy for a Wednesday night. The guy was the only server so it took him a while to get back to our table, but aside from that he gave good service. Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Came to eat Peruvian food today and everything was really good, friendly service and awesome food! We have been to other Peruvian restaurants in the past few years and this is by far the best experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here recently with a group of about a dozen.avid diners. Service was deft and everyone seemed to enjoy everything they ordered. I had the Anticuchos (beef heart--tender, delicious, not the least bit giblet-y), Seco de Res (beef stew--very tender), Helado de Lucuma (unique ice cream), and Chicha Morada (purple corn drink) and loved them all. Lots of interesting items included, such as Peruvian corn, roasted potato, platanos, and dips/sauces. At least one person used a Groupon for her order, no problem. Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"A hole-in-the-wall place in Chandler that I'm a huge fan of! I've only had Peruvian food once before when we were in New York so I don't have much to compare it to however we had a delicious dining experience at Tumi.  When we walked in, we were immediately greeted and seated and our drink order was brought out. Our waitress was patient and answered our questions about the menu items; we went with an appetizer that consisted of mashed potatoes and chicken salad with a yellow sauce & chicken wing on the side (sorry, I didn't write down the name!). It was interesting, definitely not anything like what I've had before. I'm not sure that I would order it again because I wasn't a fan of the warm chicken salad but I'm glad we decided to try it out.  For our main meals, I ordered the pollo saltado & my date ordered the lomo saltado. Both were really delicious. I'm not a huge fan of steak which is why I preferred the chicken and it went really well with the sauce and vegetables along with the french fries. I definitely come back over and over for this dish!  The only thing is, for the portion served, I found this restaurant to be a bit on the expensive side. Tumi is definitely a great place if I want to treat myself but not a place I'd go frequently."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Very much like a home cooked meal. I think they do a very good job. There's lots of good flavors in the food. The reason for three stars and not for us because when we first went in, even though we were greeted, there was no wait staff in the restaurant seating area. Took a while for us to get water and play Settings as well as a menu. After that service was pretty good."}
{"text":"Definitely a family restaurant complete with screaming children. It was ok though because the food and service was outstanding. It was nice to try something completely different due to a Groupon that brought us to that side of town. Unfortunately, the Groupon wouldn't work since the ownership had changed. Our waiter, Franklin was awesome and mentioned it right away. We still ordered according to his knowledgeable recommendations. Starting with the beef on a stick appetizer which was tender and tasty. We ordered some purple corn drink that was sweet and yummy that Franklin directed us to. When we say the entree for seafood paella we knew instantly what we were going to split. It's such a large portion that 3 people could easily have eaten it. Full of shrimp, octopus, scallops, crab legs, mussels it was outstanding. There were two TV's on the walls, turned down but with captions so we could have conversation easily.  It was CNN which was a stomach turning 'turn off', but I suppose we didn't have to look at the talking heads. Something neutral like sports would be a better choice at a restaurant.  There was a squeaky, high pitched noise the whole time either a ceiling fan or something in the back that was annoying. Cleanliness was fine, service was great, Franklin was very kind and helpful with the menu. I asked if they honor the military with a discount and he decided that they do. I always appreciate that and the tip always reflects the fact they appreciate our military and the sacrifices they and their families have made for our freedoms."}
{"text":"Great food! I would have allocated five stars if the ambiance was a little more authentic. The staff were very friendly but severely understaffed. We will return regardless!"}
{"text":"I love Pollo a la Brasa and Lomo Saltado ! Best in the Valley."}
{"text":"The chivche was the best!  Really enjoyed the food here and look forward to returning again!"}
{"text":"This was my first West Coast Peruvian dish, and coming from New Jersey I was disappointed.  Although I was told it was \"the best\"; I disagree.  I had \"Tallarin verde con Bisteck\"; & the linguine was overbooked, the sauce was dull and dry.  For the first time I had it with Parmesan cheese, which only made it drier!!!!  The beef was very thin and lacked salt, it was also too small in proportion to the pasta.  The potato was good, crispy.    The appetizer \"Papa a la Huncaina\" was ok.  Lacked salt and wasn't creamy enough. Also, their sauces (the green sauce being my favorite) was horrible!!!  It wasn't spicy, in fact it tasted like pickles...  Just gross.  Overall, the service was polite, price was ok, comfortable small atmosphere.  Very clean.  It's unfortunate I won't be going back... :("}
{"text":"Que podemos hablar de este restaurant ? Entenderán alguna vez que no solo buena comida es importante ?? Su servicio es PÉSIMO !!!!! . Hoy Sábado 26 de Mayo llamamos a las 11am cuando el restaurante recién abría para poner una orden de pollo a la brasa . Nos dijeron q lo tenían listo a la 1pm pero q mejor vayamos a recoger el pollo a la 1:15pm para estar seguros q el pollo estaba listo . A la 1:15pm cuando mi esposa ya había llegado al restaurante para recoger el pedido me llaman para decirme q mejor vaya a recoger el pollo a las 2pm por qué tenían una orden de otra persona x 10 pollos así q nosotros teníamos q esperar . Ni una muestra de atención al cliente . No le importo q hubiéramos manejado 20 millas para ir a recoger el pedido. En resumen NO esperamos . Nos dimos media vuelta y nos fuimos a comer a otro sitio donde gastamos el doble de dinero pero el servicio se lo merecía !!!! Ni más este lugar !!"}
{"text":"By far the best Peruvian food in Arizona! Great customer service and the food is very authentic and amazing taste, I have been coming at least twice a month"}
{"text":"Went to this place because of the groupon that was out.  This is a little peruvian restaurant in chandler, located in a strip mall.  We were looking for a really nice date night spot however Tumi is not quite date night material.  I would recommend different lighting - it's way too bright and the florescents have got to go.  Lovely wait staff welcomed us in and asked if we had Peruvian food before which I appreciated.  She let us taste some of the local Peruvian juices and one of them had a mango/pineapple taste so I went for that one - quite yummy although a bit too sweet for a whole glass' worth.  We initially chose the shrimp appetizer however our server recommended the Papa Rellena as it was quite popular so we switched to that.  Papa Rellena is a meat mixture in a pocket of mashed potatoes that is then fried.  The outside crust of the Rellena with the warm mashed potato on the inside was fabulous!  The meat mixture inside was pretty good although it was clear that it was pre-made and came from their fridge as it was cold.  If only the whole Rellena was warm, it would have been amazing.  My husband chose the Arroz con Maricos which is the Peruvian style paella.  It wasn't too bad.  Came with flavored rice, shrimp, squid, calamari and crab.  My husband said it was ok but was lacking some spice and deep complex flavors.  I ordered the Lomo a Caballo which was stir fried beef with yummy cooked crispy onions, tomatoes, fries, fried plantains and a fried egg on top.  I really liked my meal although the meat could have been a bit more tender.  The mixture of everything on my plate felt like a plate full of christmas presents!  I didn't know which to eat first.  :)  My favorite were the plantains of course!  The meal altogether wasn't too bad.  I would go back but my husband said he wouldn't.  Which means...we'll probably go back.  :)  If nothing, it peaked my interest in peruvian food!"}
{"text":"Tumi is one of the best-kept secrets in Chandler. The food is amazing, and the service is excellent! If you haven't tried Peruvian food before, start here. :)"}
{"text":"Great service.  The waiter walked us through the menu as it was our first experience with Peruvian food. Everything was DELICIOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried them today for the first time.  The flavors of the dishes were very good.   I have not had a lot of Peruvian food so I can't speak to the authenticity of the dishes.  Papa Rellena had a wonderful flavor with the stuffing chopped and mixed together.  Lomo a Caballo also had a wonderful flavor.  The \"sausage\" was really a hot dog.  The plantains were nicely cooked with the typical sweet flavor.  Seco de Res had a lime flavor to it.  The beef was a little tough/dry but the dish was still very good.  Yucca was what was expected.    We would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Parking is definitely tight but worth it. Slightly pricey but otherwise the food is great!"}
{"text":"Lomo a caballo is a MUST! delish with beef, rice, fries, fried eggs, sweet plantains... Everything on a plate!"}
{"text":"The only place you can find pollo a la brasa in the Phx metro area!    45 friggin mins I waited for the Peruvian rotisserie chicken AKA pollo a la brasa.  What started out as it will be availabile in 10 minutes when we arrived..well that was a lie.  What ever happened to underpromise and overdeliver!  Our server was nice enough to hook us up with two styrofoam cups of complimentary chicha morada for the long wait.    We also had the Flan and the Lomo Saltado to start when we ordered.  The flan was a perfectly cooked, creamy and smooth, with a soft silky texture.  Peruvian is mos def my favorite style of flan as well.  So they make a really good flan well whoop dee doo dah but that wasn't why we came to Tumi!  Now the Lomo Saltado is hard to mess up since it is such a popular chifa dish.  But even the lean sirloin strips were a little overdone but the flavors were all there.   But I came here primarily for the chicken!  Anxiously awaiting the arrival of the chicken.....sadly by the time we finished the Lomo Saltado and the flan.  The chicken was still not ready so when it finally arrived we had it to go.    It was great 7 hours later when we had it at least.  Perfect blend of spices and perfectly moist and exactly what I wanted.  The aji and chimichurri are always great and they gave us extra as well.  Perfect accompaniment to dip in.  I will say that the parking situation is not that great here because it is located inside a strip mall there's only four dedicated parking spots reserved for customers that eat at Tumi.  Given the \"parking wars\" that take place amongst the businesses at this strip mall I don't see how this business is NOT leaving money on the table when there is no parking on certain days.  And it wasn't even packed when we walked inside the dining area.  I had flashbacks of how LA strip mall parking is a challenge just like on this particular day.  At least in LA..they valet parking....here we parked across the street diagonally where the Boston Market is.  Minimal risk of getting towed if you park there.  But we had no choice.    5 stars for the chicken ONLY.  3.5 stars overall for a first time dine in experience  I'm not interested in dining inside here again.  But don't hesitate to get the pollo a la brasa to go and definitely call ahead in case they run out!"}
{"text":"They moved to a better location (read: closer to my house!) . Oskar is still putting out some of the best food in the valley! GO! NOW! Tumi is fantastic food! Great owner and the wait staff has been doing much better in new location. Again be a man(even if you are a woman) and get anticuchos!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!! Everything is delicious. And the owner is lovely. My only complaint is that their service tends to be extremely slow (but well worth the wait) and the decor is a bit of an eyesore. But who cares! The food is yummy! I was gifted a Tumi key chain as a good luck charm a few years ago, and it still remains on my key chain to this day. Also, it is a lot of fu to bring someone along who knows what the traditional dishes are (this means you Bella and Richie!) And I must say, there are times when the service being slow can make for a chance to just slow your roll for a bit... and enjoy all of the goodies this yummy place has to offer! GET THE CEVICHE! GET THE CEVICHE! And the platters! OH MY!!! And their soups are to die for! I just read a review which stated, \"The place is somewhat a dive but shouldn't be. If it were in a nicer strip mall and if it were nicer finished I think they would get more attention...\" I have to agree. It is way back toward the end of the strip mall and does not appear to be that enticing from the outside.\"  Thank you Tumi!"}
{"text":"This was my first time for Peruvian food, so no, I cannot tell you if it is authentic or totally made up.  I can only tell you I am not very adventurous when it comes to new foods, and I had read this was just a small hole-in-the-wall place, so was nervous going in.  However I and my daughter showed up around 3pm on a Sunday, and both of us became big fans and thought it all was great.  It was our only meal of the day, so we even had appetizer and split a dessert.  We loved everything we ordered.  For appetizer we chose Antichuchos (skewers of beef marinaded in spices and sauce, with corn, a bit of fried potato, and hot salsa),  They also bring out a tiny bowl of kernals of corn for snacking.  I was fearing corn nut hardness, but instead these were crisp with a slight taste reminiscent of corn chips. My daughter ordered Cervoches de camarones (shrimp, in a spicy hot lime juice  with onions, served a slice of yam and large corn. They were warning her it was hot, but I had a taste, and it was way less hot than I expected, as I was remembering a past Mexican shrimp dish a friend from Mexico made once.  I am thinking I may order that one next time - it was flavorful, but light.   I ordered the Aji de Gallina, a cream and cheese chicken and potato stew, served with rice to the side.  Very very good too.  We followed up with flan for dessert.  I had walked in knowing I was not going to a fancy restaurant, so had no disappointment that others here expressed. It was very clean, and neat. The girl who served us, was very attentive, very polite and helpful and we were made to feel very welcome.  I think they made the best they can considering they do not have a fancy restaurant and more obvious location.  We definitely will be back"}
{"text":"This was a surprise find. My sister and I had been planning to eat somewhere else for dinner but when we got there the place was closed for the holidays. She found Tumi Fine nearby and we were on our way. Neither of us had ever tried Peruvian food and I think Tumi Fine was an excellent place to start. Seemed like a hole-in-the-wall place with soccer (futbol) playing on the tv's and plastic chairs, but once we were served our meal it seemed just right. Popped corn kernels as appetizers, fried yucca, warm starchy potatoes and saucy meat filled us up in no time."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise! We were in the area and got a craving for Peruvian food (i am from South America). It was late, 9:15pm, and we drove by TUMI restaurant and saw the Open sign.  The hours said it closed at 9, but the chef welcomed us in regardless and personally served us.  The food was delicious - he brought us some corn kernel munchies that were yummy.  We started with fried yucca appetizer and also fish ceviche and we absolutely loved both, the fish was lightly marinated and very fresh, served over lettuce with red onion, sweet potatoes, and corn.   My hubby had the \"lomo Saltado\" which was a very tender beef cish sauteed with tomatoes, onions and served with rice and French fries. It was very flavorful.  I had a chicken picante which I was too full to eat but happily took home.  Alas, no liquor license, a beer or a pisco sour would have been the icing on the cake, but definitely not a deal breaker.  Overall, the food was great, the chef and the other patrons very welcoming, and the food was affordable, a great experience!   Definitely recommend...,muy muy Rico!!"}
{"text":"Before you tell me to get off my high horse, let me tell you that Peruvian food is the first cuisine I ever learned to eat, smell, see, cook and enjoy. After 24 years of growing up with this food, I think i've *earned* the right to be judge-y about a Peruvian restaurant in the US. I want the flavors to be on point, the ingredients to be correct (aka no substitutes) and everything else you would want out of a good dining experience- service, ambiance and great options. And for the love of god, I want people to stop thinking that our food is like Mexican food. Seriously, its insulting.  That being said, a quick note to Harold M on this experience here: Dude, i'm so sorry that happened to you. I've seen similar stories in Atlanta (see and be horrified: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/10/atlanta-boners-bbq-twitter-facebook-yelp_n_1196857.html) and you have every right to review this place based on your experience before and after this occurrence. Its distasteful and extremely childish.  Harold's experience aside, I have to rate this place based on my own experience and completely ignore his experience as reasoning for a good/bad review. Imma put my amnesia on, pretend I never read this stuff and tell you how I saw it, as bluntly and painfully honest as I can... like every review I write. Oh yeah, its gonna be a long one too, you've been warned.  Since the Groupon came out, Tumi has been exploding with people (aka all their 8 tables are full) and since this is a family-owned venue, they seem to be struggling with serving at \"high capacity\". Understandably so, yet still annoying, the service was painfully slow, so our dining experience took about 1.5 hours instead of maybe 45mins (or less) elsewhere. At the end of the night (8pm) they had already run out of papa rellena, anticuchos, all the pollo a la brasa (rotisserie chicken) and some other apps. A great problem to have, so kudos to them for being at high demand.  The chica morada I ordered was definitely home-made (trust me I really appreciate this) but a little heavy on the cinnamon and a little light on the pineapple. The cancha tostada (corn) was served cold (big no-no), unsalted and I don't know why it was served with dipping sauces (?). We ordered lomo saltado, saltado Tumi, aguadito de pollo and Tallarin saltado.  Aguadito de pollo is by far my favorite dish on this planet and it took me several years to correctly replicate and perfect it. The one here was not a bad version of the original- my only faulty points would be that the cilantro wasn't fully ground (lots of leafs hanging around there), there wasn't enough Aji flavors and the spiciness was lacking. However, i'm being awfully picky. My friends enjoyed their saltado dishes so I can't quite comment on those. The Tallarin Saltado was also nicely done- The lomo flavor was on point and the onions and tomatoes were also cooked perfectly. The noodles were A-OK, maybe they can experiment with a different type of spaghetti for a better texture.  Finally, the prices were definitely steep for Peruvian food at a family owned restaurant with their portions. I'm not comparing it to Peru prices, lets be realistic here, but everything seemed $2-3 more than what I think it should be, or believed that it deserved. The decoration was like every other Peruvian restaurant in the US, so i'm not bothered by it. The TV showing Risas the America was not my favorite since their skits are offensive as hell and I can't imagine foreigners (aka non Peruvians) understanding or enjoying this crap. Change the channel please.   THE SUMMARY: 4 stars for food. -1 for slow service.   So. picky? Yes. Too-detailed? Yes. Unbiased? Yes. Bitchy? Very likely, but I calls it how I sees it. Trust me, no one wants  local restaurant to succeed more than me, but sugar coating everything isn't going to help anyone. Come and try the food for yourself. I am 100% sure you will enjoy the food, but I can't guarantee you'll food-gasm over it. Fair enough?"}
{"text":"Awesome food...great service. Great attention to detail. Service was fabulous a little slow but well worth the wait. This place is now one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Headed over for lunch and I would definitely recommend their Lomo Saltaldo.  Went with a friend that was very familiar with the menu who recommended 70% of the dishes, so order away and enjoy for a taste of Peru in AZ. I love the two orange and green sauces they provide."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best Peruvian food I've had in az.   To start, the place was almost full on a wednesday night- good sign. The waitress was very sweet and friendly. Now about the food...  Anticuchos. Do it. They were perfectly seasoned and cooked very well. Watch out for the salsa on the side, it is INTENSE.   Causa Rellena de pollo- cold, delicious, potato chicken heaven.  Aji de gallina- full on yummies. This stuff didnt last long- it was creamy, cheesy, and again, yummies.  Last and favorite: lomo saltado. The sauce was unreal, like nothing I've ever tasted. That and the onions, tomatoes, beef strips.... great flavor. The best part was the fabulously crispy peruvian fries mixed in. However they fry these fries, they are magic.  Try this place out, there are a ton of things for the new and the experienced peruvian food fan to enjoy, you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I was quite pleased with the timely service and quality of food. I ordered the causa rellena, pollo saltado, and chicha morada. The causa rellena was bit too citrusy but still tasty. Some items are bit pricey for a strip mall location like this Having been to Peru a couple of times, I like most people fell in love with the cuisine. Tumi doesn't disappoint if you're craving good Peruvian food in the valley."}
{"text":"I have always loved Peruvian food so was happy to find this restaurant near us.  The place is relatively small and casual.  The staff was welcoming when we arrived and they took drink orders quickly.  I had Anticuchos which was tasty but a little overcooked.  I also had the Ceviche Mixto marinated in Pisco and Lime.  There was way too much red onion piled on top.  It seemed like more onion than seafood; but when I moved the pile of onion aside the dish was fantastic.  It actually looked like a small order, but it was plenty.  My wife had the Tallarin Salteado de Carne which was delicious as well.  We will return."}
{"text":"We tried two dishes: Lomo a Caballo (beef strip saute) and Tallarin Saltado de Pollo (linguine with chicken). The best part of the beef plate was probably the fried plantains, which were savory and sweet at the same time. The gravy/drippings also had a good flavor, which spread into the rice, french fries, beef, and vegetables. A couple of the beef strips were raw and therefore could not be eaten safely, which makes me wary of the quality control in the kitchen. The chicken dish had better spices and a similarly good gravy for the noodles. However, the flavors in both dishes were subtle overall. They had a nice home-cooked feel, but didn't blow us away or give us a desire to visit again. There was a nice starter placed on the table, which consisted of some kind of hollow, dried corn pieces and two tzatziki-like dipping sauces (one mild, one spicy). This was an interesting and pleasant dish to try while we waited a very long time for our food.   While the food was pretty good, the ambiance and service were not. The dining area was completely chaotic, with one assistant constantly running around moving tables and chairs... even our own after we had already been seated. There were tables noisily sliding around, chairs flying over my head, and my shoulders constantly being bumped by the two workers whizzing by in the cramped dining space. My other concern is the lack of cleanliness. The floors, tables, walls, etc. looked like they were not cleaned or maintained regularly, which is a health and sanitary concern. Ultimately, we waited about 15 minutes for anything to drink and nearly an hour for our food. The service was unacceptably disorganized and inefficient.   I can't speak to how this food stacks up against other Peruvian cuisine. The dishes were pretty good, although I would like stronger spices and flavors. The environment and service were poor. Overall, these items make it very unlikely that I would visit again."}
{"text":"We had heard so much about this place from our friends, and our daughter who lives in Chandler.  However, every time we had the hankering for a variations on our normal cuisine preferences, it is always seems to be on a Monday, and this place is closed on Mondays.  We found ourselves venturing to Chandler Fashion Square for a shopping trip, and once we were done, we decided to just head on to Tumi to sample their Peruvian offering.  One of my daughters, who has spent quite some time in Central and South America, has always encouraged us to try Peruvian Cuisine. She indicated that is divergent enough for us to recognize the difference.  And different is definitely the key theme here!   I was wanting some Ceviche, and they delivered a great combination of Sweet and Tart.  Their Ceviche de Camarones was a welcome surprise!  The pre-cooked shrimp had such a wonderful flavor since it was marinated in lime juice and Peruvian spices. And the Peruvian Corn and Yams that accompanied this dish just made for a great combination of flavors.  My wife had the Lomo Saltado, which was comprised of beef loin strips that were sauteed with various spices. It was simple wonderful.  We also ordered the Peruvian-Chinese Combination of Friend Rice. The rice was quite rich in flavor, and the had great texture.  And for dessert, the Peruvian version of Flan was fantastic. It did not have a taste of burnt caramel, and it was exquisitely sweet through and through."}
{"text":"We've been here several times and it's always so good.     We are usually the only gringos in there.... LOL!!    You know it's good when it's full of locals.     The interior of the restaurant is old and dated so don't judge it by that.   Also the A/C doesn't cool it off so maybe wait until the weather is cooler or you're gonna sweat big time.     But the food rocks!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I had a beef dish and my husband had the cerveche. Both dishes were amazing both in presentation and taste. The cerveche was spicy enough to warrant a \"hot\" rating from my husband. The beef dish (don't remember the name) had an excellent flavor and I ate every bite. The four star review is due to the service at the end. It took 20 minutes (at least) to get out check. :(  The owner looked like the only one in charge of the registrar, so maybe that's the hold up."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian food in the valley, I was disappointed to see Contigo Peru close, but this place has the same chef, so the flavors are just as good.  The only thing this place is missing is a bigger dining room and improved decor.  I will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is still an awesome place for authentic Peruvian food.  Now that El Chullo has opened, they are feeling the competition.  I would recommend that they add a couple of items to their menu, as the previously mentioned restaurant seems to have more selection or is more varied.  Regardless, this place is not fancy at all, but the taste is awesome, highly recommended to anyone that wants to try out Peruvian food, nothing on the menu will disappoint.  The Lomo Saltado is an old favorite, the Aji de Gallina is legit, the Jalea is solid and the Ceviche is as it should be, amazing, no weird flavors.  Try anything here and you will be pleased.  The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is the atmosphere and service leave a little to be desired.  Still, go now, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but the plates are a bit on the small side. We were still hungry afterwards lol"}
{"text":"Went here with a Groupon and was not disappointed. The food is authentic and very delicious. The service can be slow if they are busy but the staff is always friendly and pleasant. Highest Recommendation."}
{"text":"Overall excellent Peruvian food. Lomo a Caballo is a great dish."}
{"text":"Overall excellent Peruvian food. Lomo a Caballo is a great dish."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner today for the first time. The food is VERY tasty and just very good. As an appetizer I had \"Anticucho\",grilled beef heart skewers. I did not finish them, because my entree came and it was huge. I had Saltado de Camarones, Shrimp sauté. It came before my appetizer. As dessert, I had flan. I did not finish my appetizer nor entree. It was simply too much. I know, that I will go back, for sure."}
{"text":"Wow. What a treat. Took my wife for a date we over ordered for sure and stuffed our faces in. Went here because of yelp.  I love the fact they had inca Cola. I definitely want to go back to try the other items. Would be nice if they added bread with the nuts"}
{"text":"I haven't had some good Peruvian food with good service since last year in New York. Finally I found this excellent,  delicious spot.  We loved our dishes and the service was on point. I recommend Lomo saltado, or spaghetti Verde but everything was good. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So I've been searching for a peruvian restaurant to fill that empty void in my life since contigo peru closed and whaddya know i finally found it! The chef from contigo peru is the chef at this new restaurant Tumi.  We ordered the papa ala huancaina for an appetizer and as usual it was outstanding. For main courses I had the tallarin verde (peruvian pesto sauce w/pasta) and bisteck (pan fried steak) and my girlfriend had the chaufa de pollo (chicken fried rice), both meals were outstanding in flavor and very generous in portions. I am and will be always a loyal customer of this chef and wherever he cooks."}
{"text":"New and bigger location! Amazing mural of Machu Picchu which makes for great scenery while enjoying a meal. I appreciate good Peruvian food and the Anticuchos here are delicious. The staff was on point and friendly. I will definitely be back and recommend It!"}
{"text":"Shared a whole chicken rotisserie, platanos, rice, and salad. We were a group of 4 and everyone had their food come out at different times. Our order came at random times as well. First we got our chicken then the rice and our salad about 10 minutes later. She forgot to bring us our yucca, which was a bummer especially since I like to eat it all together. We were eating off of tiny plates. The quality of the food was ok, really it was just the service that irritated me."}
{"text":"For Peruvian Tumi is our go to spot. Usually we get two whole chickens, rice, and plantains. The people there area very nice. I've ordered more than five times and it's been worth the drive every time. This place is a decently out of my way, but well worth it. Wife is a picky eater and she loves this place.  I haven't ventured far on their menu because we are usually ordering for the family and we keep it pretty simple."}
{"text":"First time eating Peruvian food. I'm moving to Peru! It was excellent."}
{"text":"Tldr; typical Peruvian food  The factor that makes this restaurant 4 stars was the service. The owner was very friendly; he chatted with us for a while and was very attentive.   As for the food, I have had the lomo saltado and ceviche here. Both were good, typical representations of Peruvian food. If anything, definitely recommend getting the chicha morada to drink!"}
{"text":"We should really come here more.  Yeah, it's sort of a dive.  I've been in third-world countries (though not Peru) and this is sort of how their restaurants look.  So in a way the atmosphere works.  This time I had the lomo saltado.  It was very good.  They also bring out these fried corn niblets and dipping sauces...those sauces are crazy-good! Also ordered was the jalea, which is sort of like a paella.  It was very good. And it's really cool that they have some Peruvian drinks, both their version of cola (Kola) and two different fruit drinks. The flavors are unique and good.  We ended it all with a helado lucuma (Peruvian ice cream).  Again, a unique flavor.  We liked it.  I'm definitely a fan.  The only blemish is that service is a bit spotty.  Very friendly, but not very attentive.  I did say \"not good for kids\" because I'm not sure kids would like these flavors.  Depends how adventurous your kid is.  For example, the ice cream is NOT vanilla.  It's truly unique, and junior may or may not go for that.  Hence my \"not good for kids\" when YELP asked that question."}
{"text":"Based on reviews came to this place for lunch during a visit of the Phoenix area.  The place is very clean and somewhat spacious with quiet a few set of tables. The decor of this place is not the greatest. The fluorescent turquoise color of the walls and smurf blue and white tile clashes with Machu Pichu mural. I was expecting to have excellent food based on reviews, but it was  a disappointing experience. We ordered chicha morada for drink. It was watery and and too much cinnamon flavor. We ordered seco de res with Peruvian beans . it was not to my liking at all. Beans were prepared with bacon. Awful combination with the seco . Traditional Peruvian beans are not prepared with bacon at all. Meat was dried and unseasoned. Seco should be a soft meat slowly simmered so it remains with excellent flavor and moist.  The yuca frita and salsa that accompanied the seco were really good We also tried the anticuchos and they were not good. We left them all in the plate. They were dried needed salt, lack seasoning and with a strong red chile flavor. You could even see pcs of red chile (Mexican chile) should be at least some aji panca.  We were expecting to at least have a good lomo saltado , a flamed moist meat mix with the onions still crunchy and tomatoes hardly cooked, but flavor was ok to marginal. The type of meat and the way it was cut, made the meat dried and without flavor. The meat look more like stew meat. This lomo saltado lack that flamed flavor (flameado) The best dish we had was the saltado of vegetables  vegetarian version of the lomo saltado.  This veggie saltado was great excellent flavor and taste with the signature flame flavor of lomo saltado. Vegetables just cooked right and juicy flavor Service was ok. Quick, but the waitress forgot to bring the papa a la huancaina we ordered. We did not bother to remind her I would not return to this place. Unless I hear food has improved  Might be overrated"}
{"text":"I enjoyed it.  Something totally different.  Fresh made food.  Tiny strip mall location with only a dozen tables but it's worth a try.  Peru has good food."}
{"text":"Delicioso todo muy rico mi favorito saltado de mariscos, y papas a la Guancaina, los precios bien, y el servicio súper amables, fuimos a festejar el cumpleaños de mi esposo y le regalaron el pastel muchas gracias!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Our waitress recommended a appetizer & we took one bite (Yes really 1 bite) it tasted funny and I asked to send it back. It was beef heart and did not taste good! They refused to take it off the bill because we ate some of it, Really? What kind of service is that? The main dishes that we orderd were just ok and it was 10-15.00$ a plate. We had to ask many times for a refill on our drinks. Very poor customer service! Our worst restaurant experience since moving here 4 years ago! NEVER AGAIN! Bummer for our few and far between Saturday date nights!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY................................."}
{"text":"The food is good. But the service is sooo bad. Some times you had to wait long time to get some one just to ask what to drink. The guy frankly or whatever is name is... He's a total ASSHOLE.... if you ask for extra hot salsa..good luck to get it. This fucking guy is a pusher ....he wants you to order more so he can get better tips. If you have a grupon ....ufff he will be mad for it. Ca you imagine...his going to be the manager of this restaurant... This IDIOT has a very fuck attitude  ..he don't understand we the customer pay his salary. Fucking asshole ."}
{"text":"Very authentic and with nice decor. No alcohol and at tv is playing a very uninteresting soap opera. Adequate parking."}
{"text":"Tasty Food and Good Service  I found this hidden gem on Groupon...   The food was quite excellent in flavor and the portion size. I came in hungry and left happily filled. I forgot what the food was called but it was a roast beef dish with rice and beans and really was tasty!  The service from the man I am guessing is the owner was good.   They have some TVs playing football (soccer for Americans) and a definitely Peruvian feel for an atmosphere and overall color scheme."}
{"text":"First Peruvian experience and it will not be my last! The main dish was beyond flavorful. I couldn't stop eating it! The ice cream was an amazing bonus! Our coworker has been to Peru and this restaurant did not disappoint him! We all plan on going back and telling others about the amazing food! I ordered the Lomo Saltado. To drink: chicha morada and dessert: helado de Lucuma. Highly recommend it all!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this small strip mall restaurant in Chandler. We always order the beef heart appetizer, and it never disappoints! The taste is like a tender, juicy steak, and the accompanying sauces will keep you reaching for your water glass with their traditional spice. I've eaten nearly everything on their menu, and it's all fantastic. If I had to pick a favorite, which would be very difficult, I'd go for the half chicken platter. If you haven't eaten here, you're missing out. The restaurant is clean, the decor cute, the service excellent, and the food traditional fantastic. What more could you want? Maybe a Groupon? You can get That, too as of this posting. Don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Peruvian food spots. Came back for seconds lol got to have my Inca Kola fix with my chicken and the Aji de Gallina. Server was a bit rude but all was great !!"}
{"text":"Best paella this side of the Mississippi by far.  Oscar definitely knows exactly what he is doing.   The portions were very satisfying and my mate had the cilantro soup which she said \"it is on point\"!!!"}
{"text":"My first Peruvian cuisine experience and I am ready for more!!!! If this is how they eat in Peru I need to plan a trip there. Everything we had was quite tasty . The beef heart is reason enough for returning. We tried and ordered extra food in case we didn't like it and cleaned the plate!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Will have to try something else next time. We had a half chicken and a ceviche dish. If you don't like spicy I would recommend the \" little \" spicy. The normal or medium has a good bite to it( I love it hot) but for the average person it may have been a little much. ( you can always spice it up more) Free refills on soft drinks were nice.   We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"I've been to this place about 4 times now. If you know what to order, you're golden. Their good dishes are really good but, the bad ones are really bad. Hit and missed."}
{"text":"This was my firat Peruvian restaurant.  I had a friend reccomend and meet me here. It turned out to be delicious. It was a quaint location, service was friendly and pleasant. The food was delicious, our server made  a reccomendation for their most popular dish. Loved it. Would recxomend it and go again for sure. Wish it was a little cleaner in appearances.  But thought it was great."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food. Service is fantastic. I have tried several of the dishes and all are flavorful and well prepared. The drinks are good also- i like the pisco.  The bathroom needs a little tlc."}
{"text":"We were searching for a local Peruvian restaurant and found this place on Yelp. It was the midafternoon, so the atmosphere was subdued. Some may refer to this place as a \"hole in the wall,\" but the antiquated interior was much more conducive for large groups than their former location not too far away. During our visit, the green-colored décor included a large mural, blue-checkered floors, TVs, and three rows of tables stretched across the dining area.  Santi and I started with the Ceviche de Pescado ($12.95) that came with slices of tilapia stacked and marinated in lime juice, spices, lettuce, yam, red onions, and Peruvian corn. The tilapia was fresh, nicely seasoned with lime juice without it being too overpowering. The spices were nicely embedded, and accompanied well when eaten with the sharp onions and sweet lettuce. The Peruvian corn and yam were delicious too. At first I was concerned about the portion size, but the fish turned out plentiful and worthwhile.   We then shared Pollo Saltado ($11.95) made with chunks of chicken sautéed with chopped tomatoes, french fries, red onions, cilantro, mignonette and soy sauce, and a side of steamed rice. The profile of the sauce was on point to bolster the flavors of the chicken. The red onions and tomatoes also nicely contributed to the profile of this dish. The fries were tasty, fried to perfection, and I was glad the cuts were on the thicker side to soak up the sweet-savory flavors. I only wished the fries were cooked down a little more with the onions and tomatoes. It met my expectations.  The Seco de Res ($13.95) was made with stewed beef loin in cilantro sauce, green peas, and served with fried yucca, salsa criolla, and Peruano beans. The beef was very nicely seasoned with wine and other spices. It was nicely stewed, tender, but also had lots of dry spots. The use of green peas gave a nice sweet dimension to this dish. The salsa criolla and fried yucca also have some textures and sharp bites to the refined beef loins. We both loved the Peruano beans. It was nicely cooked down, subtly sweet, and flavorful.   We were also given a side of roasted Peruvian corn with aji sauce. The sauce appeared more like a chunky salsa than the creamy smooth type I usually find in restaurants.   The flavors were far-reaching, but there were a number of limitations worth noting. First, unlike most Peruvian restaurants, Tumi does not offer fresh bread as a starter for the meal. Secondly, service was friendly and courteous throughout the meal. But, for whatever reason the server personally wrote the tip into our bill before delivery it to our table, an act I find unusual, offensive, and disrespectful. Ironically, we were going to give her a bigger tip until this happened.  The server did however, give us two coupons for $10 off each time we return to order at least $15 worth of food. Given the nice gesture, I was willing to give her some benefit of the doubt, but it still negatively influenced my rating of the experience.  Interested diners should know that Yelp currently has a $10 for $20 deal at one voucher per table. I would be interested in returning to try their Anticuchos, Ceviche de Mixto, Cau Cau, Aji de Gallina, and Chaufa de Camaron."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant with a Groupon.  It was such a great surprise. The food was absolutely wonderful!!  It is a hidden gem my fiancé and I will be going back this is a  fantastic experience!!The atmosphere is authentic and the customer service was best I've had in a long time. Great discovery !!"}
{"text":"My wife is from Peru and she introduced me to the delicious cuisine of her country.  Over the years, I have tried Peruvian food around the Valley, and around the world, including Lima.  The food at Tumi is very good and is the best we have had in the Phoenix area.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"If you have never tried Peruvian food, this is a great place to go and discover this wonderful cuisine.  And if you are from Peru, you will be happy as well!"}
{"text":"It looks iffy from outside, but wow the service and food was outstanding! I just got back from Peru and it was just as good if not better. Don't let appearances fool you, please give this a try!!"}
{"text":"Everything here was OK.  Food was good, tasty, natural.  Service was OK.  Décor--OK.  Very, very small, kind of cramped with everything crammed into a tiny space.  Portions were a little bit larger than \"small\" and not quite \"medium-sized.\"  Ceviche was very tasty.  Their \"chicken stew\" or Aji de Gallina was tasty--but much more rice and sauce than anything.  It might have had 2 or 3 bite-sized pieces of chicken in it.  Final price for 2 people, 2 entrees, 2 soups, and a pitcher of the purple maiz water was ~$50 after tip.  Definitely don't think the experience was worth the time, travel, or money.  Maybe if I lived nearby and really, REALLY had a hankering for Peruvian cuisine all the time I would consider going back."}
{"text":"The review is based solely on the food. If you want something different and something tasty, you should give this restaurant a try!  I tried the Pollo Saltado and it was very good. The chicken was cooked perfectly, the sauce with the tomatoes and onions was delicious. The rice was cooked the right way, not undercooked at all, it was almost melting in your mouth! My husband tried the Aji de Gallina, it's a chicken stew made with cream, cheese, aji amarillo and nuts! It was so tasty and so delicious!  We like to try new restaurant and support local businesses, it was my first time trying Peruvian food and won't be my last!"}
{"text":"New location  but same great people and food!! Might be a little pricey but well worth it. As a Peruvian myself I can tell you this is the real deal so come and try it!!!"}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant for Peruvian Food! The moment we walked in the greetings were welcoming along with the assault on the senses of great food! :) My Mom and I both agree!"}
{"text":"Came here for a work lunch and really enjoyed it! Very unique dishes and you could tell the staff was knowledgable and passionate about the menu. Based on recommendations we tried the anticuchos, yuca frita, ceviches, lomo saltado, and saltado de camarones. Everything was delicious and the surprising standout for me was the desserts! You HAVE to try the alfajores - favorite of the table by far. The picarones and Peruvian ice cream were also delicious (all 3 in my picture). :) Definitely check this place out for a new experience!"}
{"text":"Overall the experience was good. The food was enjoyable but a bit on the salty side. Ordered the chicken soup = great. Beef stew was excellent in the meat tenderness and. The white beans were a but on the under cooked side meaning a bit hard. Rice was good. Passion fruit juice was not natural."}
{"text":"The reason why we came here was because the original restaurant we were intending to, My Arepa, had closed down.  Still wanting to stick to Latin food, and this was nearby, and that we had a coupon from the Entertainment Book for buy one entree get one free, we tried this.  The food was really good for our party of 5.  The restaurant is pretty small with just a few tables, which anything over 20 people would be too much for that restaurant, so that is a negative thing.  The cost of the dishes were a bit more than what I expected, but since there are a lot of seafood dishes, perhaps expected.  We did not go online to look at their menu or prices.  So, per person, expect to pay over $10 plus tax and tip.  The dishes are elegant and there is a lot of veggies with the meats.  My husband and I are not big into the American Mexican taste of food, so it was nice to have something Latin without the typical beans, rice thing that is prevalent in many Mexican restaurants that are more Americanized.  We called before going and the woman that answered the phone did not speak much English and answered in Spanish, so if you don't have an inkling of Spanish, communication could be an issue.    This place is not right at the NW corner of Alma School & Warner, but just north of the intersection on Alma School near where the Gun shop is.  With that out of the way, we ordered 4 dishes - Lomo Saltado, which is beef strips with onions, tomatoes, cilantro served over French Fries and a large scoop of rice.  This was tasty and my Colombian husband said it's similar to the Bistec we make at home (although, I think what we make at home is even better).  This had good flavor and is $12.  The 2nd dish was Aji de Gallina, which is a chicken stew with potatoes in a creamy sauce, also with a scoop of rice.  I liked it, but my husband and kids didn't seem to, so basically I ate a lot of the dish with a friend of ours (who very generously treated us to lunch - THANK YOU).  This dish is $11.  Since my husband is allergic to shellfish, we had to avoid all the seafood dishes with shrimp.  We did order a deep fried fish dish called Pescado a la Chorrillana, which this is covered with the similar red onions, tomatoes, and cilantro triage that the beef dish had.  This was also served with a large scoop of rice.  This dish is $15.  Lastly, we ordered a Fried Rice dish that had both chicken and beef in it.  It's a Peruvian style fried rice.  Being that I'm Chinese, it tasted similar to Chinese fried rice without the soy sauce.  Tasty and the kids really loved this dish.  I don't know how much this dish was, but in the $11-12 range.  The kids got different drinks.  Our son got a Peruvian Soda called Inca Kola, which I'm guessing is like a Coke drink.  Our daughter got Maracuya, which is a Passion fruit drink.  The latter was good, but I really just like drinking water with my food.  Didn't try the Coke.  This was an expensive lunch for my friend, and we are very grateful for his generosity.  Definitely not inexpensive, so if that's what you're looking for, this isn't the place.  The appetizer prices were what we expected to pay for lunch.    So, the negative things are that the place is really small and it's a bit pricey.  However, if those things don't bother you and you love foods like this, this is a great place to come.  Service was friendly and fine.  And it's certainly not foods you get at any of the normal places to eat around here.  If you have a party that is bigger than 4 people, you definitely should call ahead to see if they can accommodate you.  The only other place that I can compare Peruvian food to is a place that was by C-Fu many years ago that burned down.  They had wonderful food and the food we ate today was a bit different.    We'll have to save up some to come eat again, but we can put it on the places we'd like to come to again."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Food was excellent.  We thought getting there at 5:15 pm there wouldn't be hardly anyone there.  By 5:45 pm, the small place was packed with 2 big parties of about 10 people or so each and then the surrounding tables were couples or small families.  Before coming, I got a $25 Groupon for $17.  I told them before we ordered that we had a Groupon and it wasn't an issue.  My husband ordered the Lomo Saltado (Beef loin strips sautéd with onions, tomatoes, cilantro mignonette and French fries).  I ordered Pescado a lo Macho (Fish fillet fried and covered with mixed sea food spice sauce, jasmine rice).  My husband LOVED his dish and I loved my dish.   The seafood melted in my mouth (well, not the oysters or shrimp, but the rest of the stuff).  My husband really loved his dish and he said that's the one he's going to get the next time.  There was nothing left on our plates.  Neither of us ate lunch and decided to do an early dinner date with the kids being on vacation from us.  The place was a little warm, so they could crank down the A/C some.  They could hire another server for the evening.  And despite the first big party there, we didn't have to wait too long for our food.  We also ordered some Passion Fruit drink, which was good.  I would have preferred having ice in it, but that's not how they normally serve it.  We'll be back a bit sooner the next time and we were so glad we came here this evening.  Perfect for our date night."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for lunch for the first time yesterday and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavor. The waitress brought us a free corn appetizer with a red and green salsa which we promptly devoured. My wife ordered the Aji de Galina while I ordered the Ceviche de Pescado. We both drank Chicha Moradas which were delicious. My ceviche tasted fresh and spicy. My wife reluctantly allowed me to try some of her Aji de Galina which also tasted wonderful. The service was punctual and courteous. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Peruvian food is a real treat for me, so 6 of us descended on Tumi's to try the food.  We started off with Jarra de Chicha Morada o Maracuya - a pitcher of purple corn drink. It was unanimous that the flavor was wonderful. The sweetness was not overbearing as the passion fruit drink was.  Next was an appetizer. We ordered Anticuchos which were 3 skewers of heart, grilled with a touch of vinegar and some Peruvian spices. It came with a sauce that (for me) was liquid fire, and some kernels of Peruvian corn which had been softened by boiling in water. Most of us loved the Anticuchos and we all discussed how they got it so tender.  Next were the main courses, and this is where some had a few problems. Companion ordered Tallarin Salteado de Mariscos - Linguine with sea food sauté with onions and tomatoes and cilantro mignonette and instead was given Saltado de Mariscos - Seafood sauté with onions, tomatoes cilantro mignonette and French fries. Companion did not enjoy the dish but chose to not send it back. Companion felt that some components of the dish were not cooked enough.  Another of our group ordered the Cau Cau - Cow tripe on Aji amarillo and turmeric sauce mixed with Potatoes cubed and mint mignonette. This person felt the taste was excellent but the tripe needed a bit more cooking.  Yet another member of our group ordered Lomo a Caballo - Premium beef loin strips sauté with onions, tomatoes, cilantro mignonette and French fries, fried sweet plantains, sunny side up egg. Unfortunately, the egg was tremendously overcooked and there was a large amount of onion on the dish.  Still another member of our group ordered Lomo Saltado - Premium beef loin strips sauté with onions, tomatoes, cilantro mignonette and French fries. The member enjoyed the entire dish.   Our group vegetarian ordered Causa Rellena de Camaron - Two layers of mashed potatoes seasoned with lime and aji and filled with shrimp creamy. The presentation of the dish was first class, though the portion size was a bit on the smaller side.  For myself, I ordered Picante a lo Tumi - A melange of assorted seafood served with a yellow pepper sauce, rice and fried yucca. My food was delicious.  The biggest problem was the waitstaff. When bills were presented they were all mixed up and it took quite a bit of time to straighten them out.  3 stars for the good food, but could have been 4 stars had the service been proper."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty comparable to that at Contigo Peru and Inka Peru (that's probably due to the fact that I've seen the same chef at all of them).  The server was very nice too.  My only complaint is that their menu is slightly more limited than the other two."}
{"text":"I am from Ecuador but I have a Peruvian friend who brought me here and to some other Peruvian restaurants, and all I can say is that of all Peruvian restaurants here in AZ this is my favorite, their food is delicious I love it, personally because it is similar to Ecuadorian food and since I don't know of a good Ecuadorian restaurant this is my place to go. The owner is so friendly."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! My first time here. The manager & chef were friendly and social to their patrons. The ceviche mixto was fresh and full of flavor. The only downside is their small location; hopefully they can expand soon."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional!  Service was prompt and courteous.  We had the pappa rellena and lomo saltado, both tasty.  Mest was seasoned well and no fat.  Definately a return visit!"}
{"text":"Tried something new thx to ilving social, usually its places we'll never go to again. But Tumi, is great, we we're brought a sample of the chicha morado which was nice since we've never had it, we both ended up getting it. The food was good, healthy, the service was very friendly. we'll definitely be back when we're in the area again!"}
{"text":"We got a great deal through Groupon- 2 entrees, a pitcher of chicha morada, and dessert, for +50% off!  While we were deciding on our dishes, the waitress brought out a little snack for us to nosh on. Our snack was roasted, dried, salted corn kernels that you could dip in two different sauces. Both sauces were spicy, piquant, with powerful strong flavors that went well with the earthy taste of the roasted corn.  We ended up getting the Lomo Saltado and the Picante a lo Tumi. The Lomo Saltado was tasty, with tender beef, fries and rice. The beef was piled on top of the fries, so the fries soaked up the gravy and juices from the beef, making it quite flavorful.  The Picante a lo Tumi seafood dish had great flavor. The scallops and shrimp were a bit overcooked though.  In both our dishes, the rice was fluffy and tasted great with the meals.  For dessert, we ordered the flan. It was a little overcooked, as the edges of it tasted burnt.  Our pitcher of chicha morada was delicious. This purple concoction had a slightly sweet, slightly tart, refreshing light taste.  Service was speedy and friendly.  While I might not get the seafood again since it was $16 and a bit overcooked, I'd definitely come here to get their other dishes such as the lomo saltado.  P.S. One thing to note is that the Groupon does not cover tax, so you will have to pay a few dollar's worth at the end of your meal, plus your tip for the service (Please tip on the full amount!)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awful, we had to wait about an hour to get a tasteless and not very fresh meal, we were even scared to get some food poisoning after eating at Tumi's, don't go there!"}
{"text":"Do this:  Watch the 'Peru' episode of Anthony Bourdain's show \"Parts Unknown\" (it's on Netflix), and get HYPED. Then find this lovely little gem, and you'll come close to understanding why I'm so excited.  That's what we did, and I tell ya- it was a great treat. This place is SMALL. It's right next to a Chinese delivery place, and about the same size. There are only a few tables but it was pretty packed when we got here. We found a small two-seater, and looked over the menu. As we were looking, they brought us out a nice little pre-dinner snack:  roasted corn with two delightful sauces. Small thing, I know, but it's one of those little touches that just makes me want to fist bump a fish rump in joy. And those sauces... what the deuce is IN them!?!? I think the green one is culantro-inspired, but I'm not really sure...  So we ordered. Skewered marinated beef hearts for appetizers, cau cau (tripe with a turmeric sauce), and a beef dish that I can't remember the name of. Each one was absolutely amazing, and UNIQUE. There are flavors here that you just won't find elsewhere, and that's always a rare treat for me. I *LOVE* being surprised by delightful new foods, and this place did me right.  For dinner we split the Peruvian donuts and had some coffees. Everything was amazing. I really could go on and on about this place, but I don't need to. You need to just come here and eat. Seriously. Stop reading this review and eat, already!!"}
{"text":"as traditional as Peruvian food gets, only place in the US I've enjoyed a Lucuma smoothie along a traditional Peruvian breakfast - highly recommend"}
{"text":"Love the Lomo Saltado!! It is one of my favorite dishes. I have brought numerous friends and family to Tumis and nobody has gone away disappointed or hungry! Highly recommend their wonderful food!"}
{"text":"This is a great Peruvian restaurant. We have been here several times, my wife is Peruvian, and we know Peruvian food well. Today we had the lomo saltado, this is a great dish that many Americans love, and Tumi prepares it well. We also had the ahi de gallina, also great here. I have ordered the pollo a la brasa many times here and you can't go wrong with that either. Great food and great service.  We'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place 10 stars. Amazing!!! On our top 5 places now.  I had the linguine with shrimp,  with fried plantains and Yucatan. You have to try the cookie, OMG!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good here everything was fresh and cooked well. But way over priced! I would love to say this was a great hole in the wall but at $17 dollars for fried rice??? Just too expensive not a good value here. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Still great food. Fantastic flavor. The jalea was a great dish. All the seafood was very fresh including the shrimp, mussels and clams. It really is enough for two. This was a take out order so I can not comment too much on service. But in my brief wait for my order I saw the owner out helping and talking to people. By the way, there is no tipping, which makes this restaurant a real bargain. $20 for an excellent seafood dish for two! All the other food was excellent. The Pollo saltado was great as usual."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Honestly, I can't say I know from experience what \"authentic\" Peruvian food is like, but I'm guessing this is it. The food is unique, delicious, and felt like it was made with love. I get like I was transported to Peru with the first bite. The wait staff was super friendly. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My bro-in-law is from Peru and through him and his family I got to try this amazing cuisine. My sister also learned to make Peru's traditional dishes and I love it! Went here with my friend on a Wednesday night and it wasn't too busy. It's a quaint place inside of a strip mall. I ordered the chaufa de pollo which is basically chicken fried rice and it was a huge portion! I ate about 1/4 of it and saved the rest for later. It was really good! Next I will definitely be trying the papa a la huacaina or the lomo saltado."}
{"text":"Best Peruvian experience I've had in the Valley so far.  Very friendly service.  The ceviche de pescado is excellent.  Thinly sliced, delicious yam, corn is ok, and the juice is amazing.  Ask for extra aji.  The lomo saltado, cau cau de mariscos, lomo a caballo, and a causa rellena with shrimp are all very flavorful and made my entire table extremely happy.    I usually come here at least twice a month.  Everyone I've brought becomes a regular as well."}
{"text":"Even though they've moved, the food hasn't changed and that is a good thing (seco de res and lomo a caballo - mmmmmmm).  I like the new space with its booths and non-stop futbol.  More than one server is also a plus."}
{"text":"Ceviche was THE BOMB! Get their ceviche! You will not regret it"}
{"text":"Delicious! I found Tumi thanks to Groupon. And we will were very impressed with the appetizers the food and the staff. So many choices. Papa Rellana Arroz con Mariscos, the special hot sauces. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Overall, a great dinner. The server was friendly & very patient especially with our strange questions related our naïveté to Peruvian food. The purple corn drink is a must try!"}
{"text":"Wow! Excellent food! Great service! Nice little neighborhood place. Prices are good, I can't say enough good about this place. We'll be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Service was good as well, but bit slow. Aji De Gallina is my favorite!"}
{"text":"After some people had mentioned that they liked this place, my wife and I decided to go and test, yet again, another Peruvian restaurant.  We ordered 3 different meals, lomo a caballo, arroz con mariscos, and pollo a la brasa.  The lomo a caballo would have been pretty good, but the sauce they had was sweet, which I didn't like at all.  The arroz con mariscos was bland, hardly any flavor.  The pollo a la brasa was far from the real deal, being dry and unflavorful.  we did get a free soup with our meal, which was the best thing we tasted there.  The sodas tasted like there was dish soap in them, and were not refilled until I finally had to ask.  We also had to ask for the sauces for the pollo a la brasa.  The aji that was served with the bread was pretty decent, but not enough to save the rest of the meal.  Overall, it was too pricey for the service and the quality of the food.  Sadly, we haven't been able to find a Peruvian restaurant that we like in AZ, and this one was probably the worst one we've tried.  Wow! It's a good thing you can edit these reviews.  A lot has happened since I made this review, which the last time I checked is an opinion of what I think.  The owner of this restaurant, upon reading my review, posted it on \"Peruanos en Arizona,\" a group on Facebook.  He mentioned my full name in the review, opening it up to his \"friends\" to personally attack me.  He also said that that I went in to his restaurant complaining of the decoration of his restaurant. (which I didn't).   My wife made some comments, defending our opinion, and then he scanned our yelp coupon (which has my full name on it,) and order sheet that was made when we paid, and posted it on the same page as a picture, claiming that he was right about me making comments about the decoration. (which is not shown in the picture.) He claims to be a professional, but is far from it.  I had nothing against him personally, until now, but in one of his comments he says that there is no possible way that so many things can be wrong with his food unless I have something personal against him.  I don't think I need drive to a place and pay for a meal to make a review on someone who I personally don't like. He also posted the same review on his personal facebook page, to which his \"friends\" responded things like, \"poor gringo, he only knows what frozen hamburgers and hot dogs taste like\" and \"He doesn't have the smallest idea of what real Peruvian Food is, he probably hasn't even been there,\" \"with a last name like that, what does he know,\" \"He's one of 'those' customers\", \"I hope the seafood got him sick,\"  words like jealous, ignorant... things like that.  Now if I didn't know any better, I would think that a gringo's opinion doesn't matter when it comes to real Peruvian food, too.  However, I HAVE been to Peru, I DO know what good Peruvian food is supposed to taste like, and my wife, who is actually FROM Peru was equally disappointed with the food, and service.  Her mother cooks 50 times better than this guy, and we both know that what we ate doesn't compare to what real Peruvian food is supposed to be.  So, instead of taking this as constructive criticism, the owner has taken it as a personal attack against him, and has to look for validation from other people who surround him.  We probably would have been back there again, because my wife's family would have wanted to try the \"new Peruvian restaurant\" which has happened before with others, but now no one that we can tell to about our experience will ever go there.  There are also many many many other sites to review a restaurant, not just Yelp.  I'll make sure to put this same review on other sites, too.  That will also give me time to think up other things that I didn't like that I didn't mention on my original review.  Like how this \"professional\" was negotiating delivery prices with a meat driver right in front of the guests.  When I made this review, Yelp posted it on my facebook page, but I took it down because it was negative, but I will be sure to post it now.  I don't know if what this guy did was legal, but I'll find out soon enough.  I just hope he doesn't put my Debit Card number up on facebook.  So, if you're going to give this place a negative review, watch out!  You'll be personally attacked for your OPINION, and be lied about and be told you don't know what you're talking about.  He has since taken down all his posts, but I saved all the screenshots if anyone is interested."}
{"text":"There's a part of me feels like the life I led before discovering this place - and Peruvian food in general - was a waste.  Don't end up like me. Eat here soon."}
{"text":"I would give it five stars, but last night I ordered online at 8:00. I waited the maximum 30 mins although it has taken them much less time before. I went in and told them I'm here to pick it up, and the lady at the register looked confused. My order did print out but they didn't bother looking at it. They weren't really busy, just two other families. They said give them 10 mins, and I usually don't like to argue so I sat outside and waited.  Well, while I was out another man came in who also ordered from home to pick up. They took care of him before me, he had way more food and ordered later than me. About 30 mins later. This place closes at 9, and I got my food finally at 9:05 lol. Another table beside me barely got their plates around the same time, and looked very frustrated and told me they were waiting for an hour.   To be fair, they did give me two free drinks since I was ordering for two and apologized for making me wait, which I really appreciated. I don't know, they used to have such amazing service the previous times I've been there but these past few months they've been really slacking.  As for the food, THE BEST! I got the lomo saltado and the pollo saltado for my boyfriend. It's what we always get because I'm too afraid to something different, as they're kinda pricey. I just love how they mix the fries and rice and meat of choice together. SO GOOD. I had a little food baby all night. This is the only reason I keep coming back, most amazing food I've ever had."}
{"text":"First plate I ever tasted was the Lomo Saltado, I have never seen chicken with French Fries that were drizzled to perfection, the second dish I had was the seco de res which was by far the best dish I have ever tasted. When I came down to alcohol I would suggest the Pico Sour, which is an egg white drink! Be careful it will sneak up on you!"}
{"text":"I like Peruvian food a lot , is very tasty. So I went to this Rest. El Tumi. The owner & the staff are very nice. Is a small place but it has a family atmosphere and is clean. Food was excellent, I ordered the Seafood Paella and  Causa with chicken which is one of the best I ever had. The tostones [ flat fried plantain] are very good too. Prices are very reasonable. We had a good time and very tasty lunch.  We be back soon. Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Great place, even though it's kind of small, the place felt pretty good, great service by the personnel and the owner (he even hooked up with a discount for our next visit!)... the Food was very tasty, my GF had Pollo Saltado and I had the Tallarin de Pollo Saltado; both plates were really good and very flavorful! We also had the Papas a la Huancaina, they were pretty good too!... I will come back and encourage other to stop by and endulge themselves with their dishes."}
{"text":"We went there for Mother's day and while the restaurant was packed and it did take a while to get our food, it was well worth the wait!  Definitely plan to go back again!"}
{"text":"Searching for some good home style Peruvian food and I came across Tumi from Groupon.  Since then, I've taking my family and friends there several times.  Food is delicious.  Not over priced.  Large servings.  Good location and chef Oscar is awesome!  My favorties dishes are Lomo Saltado and Ceviche.  The only complaint I have are the many changes in waiters/waitress within the past months.  Not very friendly at all.  If Tumi can find a set of waiters/waitress with great customer service, I would give it 5 stars.  The food is what brings me back all the time."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in our little corner of Chandler. $30 for two and truly excellent Peruvian cuisine. The fish was delicious: batter fried and crisp under a blinket of veggie saute served with rice and yuca (best I've had). No bar."}
{"text":"This place is a tiny little hole in the wall type restaurant.   Super good food and super nice people. Will def be back.   Tried the Peruvian Fried Rice and the Soltado with Egg on top. Both were very good. The hot sauce they make with the Rocoto was AMAZING."}
{"text":"Outstanding flavors.  Chumpi with delicious sauces..  carne fried rice,  meat was very tender n prepared n cooked to perfection..  Rice was done right and better than most asian places..  I had the ceviche camarones,  or shrimp ceviche..  Though this wasn't at all what I thought it would be,  I was going to compare to local / mexican style ceviche,  plus this was so far different,  like a totally different dish with only the shrimp in common...  Sweet,  Sour,  spicy and delicious all in one..    will be back to try more variations,  only my 2nd time eating a peruvian cuisine..  i like it.."}
{"text":"We love this cute mom and pop Peruvian restaurant. It's a little cheesy with the mural and paper place mats but it's still sweet and a little charming. Our faves are the Ceviche Mixto with scallops, squid, shrimp and white fish. Lots of sauce on top with corn and yams.   Our other go to are the different rice specialty dishes the Lomo a Caballo is with beef, sauteed veggies and plantain chips. We always order an extra side of the plantain chips since they are that good. The owner is adorable and welcomes compliments as we walk out of the restaurant. Sometimes, when the place is packed for dinner service can be a little slow but it's just because it's usually just 1 server. We don't mind waiting a little for our drinks to refill in return for dinner and leftovers. Thanks Tumi!"}
{"text":"Our friend was craving for a Peruvian food so we decided to give this place a shot. Service was great from the moment we stepped foot in this place. We were greeted with a friendly smile and escorted to our table within 2 minutes of walking in. Waters and drinks took a few minutes but not anything to complain about.  Waitress made some great recommendations and we ended up ordering (for our hungry party of 3):   APPETIZERS:  1. Papa a la Huancaina, (potatoes Huancayo style): Potatoes with a Peruvian with an aji amarillo cheese sauce. This was pretty tasty although I wish it had a bit more punch in the flavor. This dish I've had better at other places although still tasty.  2. Choclo con Queso Fresco, (LARGE peruvian corn on the cob served with queso fresco and ahi amarillo cheese sauce): This isn't your standard corn on the cobb. The texture is ENTIRELY differently. Color is a light yellow and the size of the kernels are about 4 times the size of your standard white or yellow corn kernels. This is no joke LOL! The texture is more chewy, al dente and that's honestly what I loved so much about it. I recommend cutting the corn kernels off the corn and taking a bit with the quest fresco and cheese sauce on it together. SUPER NOMS - HIGHLY recommend this dish!  ENTREES:  1. Arroz con Mariscos (Peruvian Paella): I honestly was very leery to try this when the waitress recommended it because I figured it would probably be overcooked, the rice would be mushy, and overall it would be blah and bland. I was more than pleasantly surprised!  They don't skimp on this dish AT ALL. It was a HUGE plate and the paella was surrounded with beautifully pickled red onions and tomatoes chunks. The rice was perfectly cooked, still al dente, packed full of flavor, and LOADED with FRESH seafood. The seafood was perfectly cooked and not rubbery surprisingly! It came with baby scallops, mussels, clams, squid, Octopus, and shrimps.  We eat ate 2 bowls and still had half the dish left to take home. HIGHLY RECOMMEND this dish as well!!  2. Pollo a la Brasa (Peruvian Rotisserie Chicken): You can order a quarter, half, or whole order. We got the whole chicken and it was AWESOME!!! I'm not a huge fan of dark meat but it was very flavorful, moist,  and juicy. The only thing I was missing was the crisp on the skin. The fries that it came with were blah but dip the chicken in the two salsas they provide and it's a game changer!! The white beans it came with were surprisingly delicious too. They were more watery, but super creamy and packed full of spices and flavor.  DESSERT:  I forgot what they're called but they're essentially (2) flaky buttery shortbread cookies stuffed with dulce de leche. They were definitely good but very rich and not anything super special. I wouldn't go out of my way to order it but if it was ever in front of me again, I would definitely eat it :P  Come give this place a shot my fellow foodie bears! I'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I grew up with my Peruvian father making his native dishes for the family, and I spent a month in Lima when I was a teen, so I respect & enjoy Peruvian cuisine. I've dined at Inka Fest, which was okay, but Tumi is now my favorite.  My son & I visited Tumi in early January when he was in town for the Fiesta Bowl. Starting with the corn & aji, to the Peruvian tamale, to the papas a la Huancaina, to the lomo saltado (strips of steak mixed with french fries, red onions, tomatoes & seasoned with cumin, s&p, vinegar, served with rice) & seafood saltado (same ingredients except for shrimp, scallops, squid & fish instead of steak), everything was outstanding. My mouth was in Heaven all evening! And can't forget the chicha morada (missed the traditional diced apple topping) & the Inca Kola! Totally yummy experience! (Had to pass on the alfajores for dessert because we were stuffed!)  Tumi is located in a small area within a strip mall. We were seated immediately and were eventually the only customers there. We were not disappointed!  One of the best parts was meeting chef Oscar, so we could pass on our compliments. Definitely will eat there again - and I'm bringing friends!!! :)"}
{"text":"My first visit to Tumi's Peruvian Cuisine was such a delight.  The service was beyond spectacular, the food was exceptional, and the drinks were reasonably price and delicious.  It was so good I wanted to go back the very next day.  I can't say enough about this restaurant!  Thank you to the owners of the restaurant for giving the East Valley a taste of Peru!"}
{"text":"Really really delicious. I really enjoyed this place. Place is clean, friendly, and amazing. I tried the Lomo Saltado and the Seco de Res of their specialties. Definitely recommend and will be back!  Those red and green sauces they give you with your meal are some of the best flavors I have ever tried."}
{"text":"Very small restaurant, perhaps 8 tables  The food was excellent, had the papas rellena as a starter along with a side of fried yucca, the aji verde sauce was delicious and spicy - i could eat that on anything  We also split the Pescado a lo Macho, which is fried fish with a seafood mix and spicy sauce served with jasmine rice   Excellent food, we will certainly be back as we love Peruvian food, similar in style to Contigo Peru (I believe they had the same chef at some point) - with a Yelp Deal how can you beat that"}
{"text":"I crave the sauces! They're soooo good. I could eat them with a spoon and lick the bowls. The Lomo Saltado is yummy. The beef is tender and the sauce, fries and tomatoes are great with the rice. Plantains are great. There's a soup that's really good."}
{"text":"Walked in and was refused service due to all tables being \"reserved.\"  Needless to say I won't be back. I'd rather drive to Grullo's in downtown Phoenix."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with good food. At $70 (including tip) for three people,  I felt it was overpriced though. Also, I was not given a refill on my iced tea. The Beatles played on pan flute compilation being played as background music was interesting. Although the food was good, it wasn't anything special so I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Manager refused to honor Groupon even though it's not expired. Seafood platter was dry and fried rice was tasteless."}
{"text":"Muy buena comida Peruana en chandler, demora un poco el servicio porque preparan todo fresco. Muy Rico lo recomiendo 100%"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Very small, so I'm guessing it can get pretty busy. Definitely a good experience. The lomo was good."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure. Fresh ingredients and just the perfect amount of spices. The marisco saltado is one of the best I've ever had.  BRAVO!!!"}
{"text":"Purchased a Grouopn because I love Peruvian food.  I am Cuban and went to Peruvian Restaurants back home in Northern New Jersey. I have eaten Peruvian in Toronto, Madrid and even Paris. It's a wonderful cuisine from a fabulous culture- and I love that !  By brother  came back from this restaurant with rave reviews. So I had to know it was good- and it was ! The place is not perfect- but the food was. After reading the reviews here I expected high prices and small portions. Well, I am as big as house @360lbs and I hate small portions. These were not small portions. I actually took food home with me.   The appetizers,  delicious- the stuffed mashed potato with a layer of chicken salad a topped with a light cream sauce. Not just delicious, it was beautifully prepared. Although I was not expecting a cold dish, as soon as I stuffed some in my mouth, I just shut up and ate. The appetizer of boiled potato with a cream sauce ( reminds me of a Hollandaise sauce) was excellent. What, no tamales ?  :(  Entrees- the Lomo al Caballo  ($11.25- and totally worth it) - wonderfully seasoned chicken breast sauteed with french fries, tomatoes and sweet onions and all brilliantly topped with two sunny side eggs and a side of white rice and fried sweet bananas- the best bananas I ever ate ( and I'm Cuban). Growing up my favorite Cuban dish- and probably still is - the ultimate Cuban comfort food: Fried eggs over white rice and french fries!  Is was my favorite thing there. My partner and I fought for it.   Second entree- Tallarin Salteados, ($ 9.95) Think lo mein without the distractions of bean sprouts and other veggies- just loin steak ( which was like butter), sweet onions, and tomatoes in a wonderful sauce. It was actually better when I ate it at midnight.   Finally desert was Peruvian Fried donuts- like a light funnel cake. Thank God we each ordered a serving as they were excellent, although I did not care for the syrup that they were sitting on- they didn't need it.  This is Fine Dining people. The prices are not high considering the size and quality of the food. Taste is subjective but I can't for the life of me understand why this was so harshly reviewed by the one gentleman. Soap suds in the soda ? Please ! Look I'm not Peruvian- I'm not Italian, but damn know good food.  As for not having enough choice on the menu, it's a smart chef that controls quality by not offering everything. Except for the tamale- all the usual suspects are here.  The place was clean. Service could have been better- not that we did not get our food quickly, but because the help was sitting around talking- no biggie- but annoying. The chef cooks everything fresh and at the moment, so it's not fast food.  And as for the man with the one star review, I can only think that he ( or his wife-god bless her little heart) ,might have an agenda. Dare I say, maybe she is friends with the competition ?"}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon, wanting to try something different, and Tumi received mostly great reviews.  Pretty dismal looking strip mall front, but that is not a determining factor for us. Inside, meager furnishings & décor. Looks like it could use a good cleaning.  Ordered an appetizer which turned out to be a boiled potato, with a mayo sauce over it, with 4 small grilled shrimp. It was ok.  For dinner, arroz con mariscos, or seafood paella for two.   Not bad. Rice was fine, plenty of mixed shellfish, but the clams and mussels were overcooked and rubbery.  Tried some dessert. The Peruvian ice cream was the best part of the meal. A taste of butterscotch & coffee. Quite nice. The donuts we ordered with the ice cream came 15 minutes later, and were ok. a little heavy & greasy.  Food....................C Service.................C- Ambience..............D Value.....................C-  Sorry, see no reason to return. Other reviews are, in my humble opinion, hyperinflated out of kindness."}
{"text":"I been wanting to eat Peruvian food for a while and finally I found a place with delicious food.    The place is regular medium size and very Tiffany blue in the inside.   I got there at 8:30 pm and they close at 9 pm.  The waiter was nice but he was rushing us to order ( I don't blame him, he was ready to go home).  I was really hungry I wanted to order but i wasn't familiar with the menu.   Anyway after I got my food I was very happy because the food was delicious and it had a nice presentation as well.   I want to go back and try all the dishes.    The waitress got friendly at the end ...   To bad they close at 9pm."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic Peruvian food! Great service. Lomo saltado and ceviche are our favorites but the whole menu is great!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Peruvian restaurants in Arizona. Good, reasonably priced, authentic Peruvian food is hard to find in the valley. Everything I have had is delicious. If you want to try food you have never heard of before and be amazed. Here is the place!"}
{"text":"Great authentic food!  I had a Papa Rellena and it was fantastic! The sauces served were very good too - probably ranks as one of the best sauces.  For my meal, I had a Lomo a Caballo (similar to Lomo Saltado but with fried plantains & an egg on top of the rice).  It was delicious! I will definitely come back here."}
