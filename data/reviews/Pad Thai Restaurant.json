{"text":"Once again I attempted to try this Thai food place because it's close to work. I love Thai food but the food such as pad Thai lacks so much flavor and was dry that I found myself saying it up on my own with sweet and sour and hot sauce. A let down for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and great service every time! Best chicken wings I've ever had. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable, very friendly staff, very cozy atmosphere. Quick service too! We split the pad thai and tom kha soup. Both were great."}
{"text":"Pretty average.  Really a shame, because it's the only Thai place near my work.  The lunch special was really cheap too, and you get enough for 2 meals (only $5.35 for pad thai, veggie fried rice and a spring roll).  The pad thai was OK, but really nothing to write home about.   The panang curry was yucky and was not enough for 2 meals.  Also the iced coffee was weird tasting.  
 Service was good- I called in my order to pick up and it was waiting on the counter when I arrived."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant based on Yelp reviews.  Thanks Yelpers you were right.  This is a great restaurant tucked away in a neighborhood.  Don't let the plaza influence your first impression as the restaurant has great Thai decor and immediately took us back to Thailand and yes its very authentic.  It wasn't too busy the night we went so the chef Pat came out and talked to us about many of the dishes.  She makes everything from scratch and uses the mortar and pestle to make all of her curries and sauces which really brings out the flavors.  My to die for dish was the Pandan chicken.  The chicken is marinated for 5 days and then cooked to perfection and drizzed with light sauce that was so delicious I couldn't stop commenting on it.  We also had a red curry, pinwheel dumplings and the shrimp rolls which were delicious.  The ambience and friendiness of the staff just add to the overall experience with great food.  We will be back and bring friends.  It's a great place for couples of families.  p.s. try the lemongrass mojito, delicious."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Wish the portions were larger for the lunch special. I wasn't impressed overall. But the wait staff were nice!"}
{"text":"I'm a Thai food foodie. Whenever I travel I seek out good Thai food. Pad Thai restaurant was recommended to me as having the best cashew chicken around. Cashew chicken is my goto dish for rating Thai food. Keep in mind that I'm rating this restaurant against some of the best. 

At Pad Thai, the service and decor was standard (fairly quick, nicely decorated). The Cashew Chicken was good but didn't have that \"Wow! This is good\" factor. 

Be careful with the spicy level - it's higher than you would think. A \"one\" is more like a level \"three\". 

All in all I would recommend going there if you're nearby and hungry for Thai food. 

Look for at least one more Thai food review from Las Vegas from me. 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"If you're a foodie or you just really enjoy authentic, fresh Thai cuisine ... this is NOT for you. Average at best. The words \"Pad Thai\" are in the name of the restaurant so it's hard to see how they can screw up that classic. But they managed to do just that. If I didn't know better I'd think they were using french dressing instead of the classic Tamarind based sauce. \"Meh ... I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"1. Great service
2. Best Thai food I've been to in vegas
3. Recommend pad Thai and eggrolls 
4. Tell them, Keno sent u :) 
5. Thank you, \"I'll be back\""}
{"text":"Very disappointing place. Not authentic at all. Ordered Mongolian chicken and chicken with baby corn...the chicken had a smell that was not appealing at all. It was like they warmed up previously cooked food and served it. 0 stars for sure"}
{"text":"Man I've been looking for a good pad Thai in this area and this is by far my favorite! Can't wait to try more items."}
{"text":"They do not understand spiciness level at all. Their 1 feels like a 10! I live very close to this restaurant and have come to this place many times, and unfortunately, they make the food more spicy than requested all the time. 
Otherwise, their food is good. If you like very spicy food, it could be a great choice of a Thai restaurant. I can't handle very spicy food, so I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Fast delivery and great food. Tom khaa is better than chicken soup for a cold and this place has great soup loaded with veggies, and creamy coconut milk. Easily some of the best I've had. The house fried rice is pretty standard but not at all oily and the meat used is super fresh instead of obvious dried out leftovers like many places use. This is my second order from this restaurant, both times have been excellent value. My new favorite Thai place!"}
{"text":"Staying at the Sheraton by the airport and very pleasantly surprised to stumble upon this restaurant. Don't let the outside fool you,  the restaurant was nicely decorated. The food was excellent and the waitress was beyond friendly.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We drove through from Chicago- and are Into Thai food!! This place had fantastic food, service, and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Staff is nice. They get pretty busy at lunch time, but the wait isn't that bad. Staff tries really hard. We always get the lunch special which comes with small salad & soup. The fried bananas are yummy."}
{"text":"I ate at the restaraunt and had yellow curry chicken, and it was good the first time which was the reason why I came back, but the second time I had it, it smelled like urine. Thinking that it was a mistake, and that no restaurant would do such a thing, despite my original thought, I tasted the food. It tasted disgusting. I'm not one of those people who complain all the time. For me to complain, it has to be really bad. Not wanting to eat another bite, I told the waitress that I wanted to just pay for my drink. She asked the manager if I had to pay for the meal, and he said yes. I told her that no restaurant would make a person pay for a meal that they did not fully eat, and would take the food off their bill. She did not believe that that practice is done in Las Vegas. Anyway, I had to pay $5, and definitely will not be back..."}
{"text":"Pad Thai that is just like the way they make it in Thailand!! Truly authentic and the best spring rolls that I've had in the city."}
{"text":"We've had food delivered here at work from them for years. Always good with dependable delivery. Good lunch specials everyday. Never been in the restaurant though."}
{"text":"For me, this place teeters between 3-stars to 4. 

Not the best thai in town. Not really sure to impress, but it's decent. I come here mainly for their lunch specials (Until 3PM daily I believe?). $6.95 for small salad, small soup, and you get to choose from their list of entrees like curry, pad thai, mongolian beef, and regular vegetable plate. 

Don't expect dinner-sized portions here for lunch! Portion control is pretty awesome here. 

Their penang curry is decent. Not the best I've had, but it feels like a home-cooked meal at my mom's house. My spicyness levels for my curry always come out just right. Flavorful. Lately, the lunch special one has been a bit smaller than normal though...

The vegetable dishes are a miss for me. Lean, cook pork slices with broccoli, chinese cabbage, and carrots are healthy and perfect for the dieters or light lunch crowd. But it's bland, boring. Again, reminds me of good home-cooking of a classic, ubiquitous asian dish. These dishes are not really meant for customers to be blown away or to be ordered to be 'wowed'. It's honest offerings of a culture. 

The service is pretty good! They always come back to check up on you and refill your drinks. I'm a total water-drinking fiend when it comes to the curry. I'm a total bitch when it comes to spicy foods. 

I always leave pleasantly full after lunch here. It's so close to everywhere I need to go.  It helps that my food always comes out in a flash when I'm in a rush. I haven't seen this place super busy because I've always come at the tail end of lunch rush (right when lunch specials is about to end at 3pm). But, I've heard this place does get super packed from the people in the medical offices nearby. I'd rather spend money here than fast food. 

Quick, convenient, the prices are unbeatable for what the food is. I've liked the food here, but some dishes are hit-or-miss. Definitely not a place to impress that cute copy chick you've been waiting to ask out on a date. But, maybe after you make her your girlfriend and you guys just want to order cheap thai takeout and chill out all night watching Game of Thrones reruns. Pad Thai is perfect for that, and that's okay."}
{"text":"Went there twice.  The first time was a \"to go\" order- not only was it not what I ordered, the food was not super fresh. About a year later,  I gave it another shot  because it is about 50yards from my house.  We Sat down, not 60 seconds later a huge roach ran across the table.  We got up and left."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood thai place! I had the mint chicken at a 5 level of hottness and could have standed it a little spicier but it was still dang good! I have been here twice and both times it was almost empty, not sure how it stays in business with the lack of customers, but I wish it luck!"}
{"text":"Below average, but overall not too gross. I had the sweet and sour pork - something that is usually pretty much the same no matter where you go. The sauce was nice and the pork was quality meat. The fried rice was ok, but not great. I was disturbed, however, by the Thai iced tea. It tasted how pupperoni dog treats smell - kind of fake and meaty. I don't know about you, but that's not something I want in a beverage."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Came back here for the first time in a few years.  Still delicious!  Pad Thai is a must!  I wanted beef but I got the chicken because it was on the lunch special.  I also ordered the coconut soup. Was pretty damn good but a tad bit too sweet. The service is great, but the booths are uncomfortable.  That's not going to stop me from coming back though!"}
{"text":"We just ordered takeout dinner from this new pad Thai place on 4th Street and enjoyed our meal enough to post a review! We ordered the pad Thai,  green curry, moneybags, and spring rolls and the spring rolls were some of the best I've ever had. Great quality Thai food and very nice staff. Would highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"If I could give no star I would, first I work in a medical field where lunch breaks are very limited, so I decided to order ahead...... When I got to the place and found out that I do have a little more time than expected I decided to dine in instead. I got to the counter no one was there(mind you they know i'm standing there, they saw me walked in) after being ignored for 10mins finally a lady walked up and I told her I had ordered ahead of time, and I said I would like to dine in and she had burst out saying I wasn't suppose to do that and told me to \"sit there(pointing at the corner table)\" I had ask her if there was any problem, and she said no your not supposed to do that and they took a lot of time packing those boxes.... and walked off. Not to mention no water was offered.. Had to walk up to the counter 3 times before being attend to. POOR customer service overall, I didn't even get a chance to eat my food because I had lost my appetite of how bad I was treated. Never again. Thanks for your horrible service!"}
{"text":"Was excited about trying this place but only found it so so. I'm surprised by the other 4 and 5 star reviews... Location is good with parking in front and the restaurant is nice. Portions are on the smaller side and pricier. Lemongrass chicken wings were a bit bland, panang curry was watery and didn't taste authentic (needed more kaffir lime leaves?), chu chi basa was not bad and the pad thai was actually good but lacking a bit of spice. The service was unusual and a bit slow. Overall was disappointed and likely won't return... There are other thai restaurants in Calgary at better value."}
{"text":"Grabbed Pad Thai the other day because this week has been noodle week.
Out of all the places I have visited...this Pad Thai was my least favorite. It was soggy and bland.

The noodles were micro thin and it was very wet in the bottom. The wetness was a mix of water and oil? 

The portion when I opened up the carry out was small. The cabbage and vegetables covered the whole container. (see my pictures) 
This Pad Thai was also the most expensive one that I ate this week, costing $9.70.

I really wanted to like this place. 
They did assure me over and over that they didn't use fish sauce...but I just noticed two years ago when I inquired that they said fish was in the veggie items?

Parking lot was full, it's a nightmare of a parking lot and there was only one table inside. I came at 12:30pm on a Friday.

They seemed nice enough but for unknown ingredient and bland food, I'll pass."}
{"text":"Thankfully! We found a GOOD Thai place in Calgary. Although they maybe a little pricey the food is very good. Try the drunken prawns if you get a chance. Their pad thai is very good and the curries are terrific as well. We've only eaten in, and the servers are always friendly and very responsive. 

If you're looking for a good Thai restaurant in Calgary, this is it!"}
{"text":"Delicious, affordable, very friendly staff, very cozy atmosphere. Quick service too! We split the pad thai and tom kha soup. Both were great. I also enjoyed my mango juice and my girlfriend liked her pina colada."}
{"text":"I just found out about this place after moving here this week to Las Vegas and wow, it's sooo good! I'm spoiled in Hollywood, I thought we have the best Thai food anywhere but the green curry I had here was amazing and I will be back to try everything else on the menu. It's a very clean little place with nice staff and big flavors!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a co-worker. They have $5.95 and $6.95 lunch special options. The lunch special comes with choice of egg drop or hot and sour soup, a salad, and an eggroll. I opted for hot and sour soup and ginger beef. 20 minutes later after placing our order, we didn't even get our soup or salad. People coming in after us were halfway through their meals. I flag down a waitress to inquire and she apologizes and walks away. The original waitress comes by and apologizes stating it was her fault because she forgot to put in THE ENTIRE ORDER. Shortly after our food comes through, hot & sour soup was the highlight. The ginger beef was bland with chewey pieces of beef. Do you think they offered anything to rectify their mistake and taking away 20 minutes of our lunch break? That would be no. The waitress tried to make fake niceties and small talk after. Bland food and careless staff.. no thank you."}
{"text":"I had a hankering for thai food a couple weeks ago and found these guys on Yelp.  I ordered about 40 bucks worth of various dishes... shrimp pad thai, green curry chicken, spring rolls, a thai iced tea and I think that was it.  I don't remember all that well because most of the food went into the trash.  The iced tea was about the only thing that was exceptional.  Everything else was pretty much blah.  Not a lot of meat, and the curry was super greasy.  The pad thai was dry and tasted like it was anything but fresh.  My quest for GREAT thai food continues.  The one thing that surprised me is that when I went to pick up my order, their dining room was packed with lunch guests.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong dishes (???)"}
{"text":"Here's the heart of the matter--stop in here if you're in the Charleston & Rancho area near UMC and are  looking for quick, inexpensive Asian-American lunch specials, and friendly service.  You'll like this place.  $6.95 lunch specials offer a cup of hot & sour or egg drop soup, a small iceberg lettuce salad, with a  moderately sized entree. I had the chicken panang lunch special which was filled with thin slices of tender chicken breast in a coconut milk curry sauce and walked away satisfied, with time to run an errand and money to spare.  If you want fancier, traditional Thai, you already know to check Yelp for other options."}
{"text":"THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST THAI RESTAURANT I EVER VISITED. 

We had shrimp fried rice and Phad tai. And these guys was twerking on my tongue. 
Scent of fire was completely contained in every rice. And the texture was enough moisty and dry. 

Thai food is one of my favorite food, and this restaurant is the best since i visited many countries for having Thai foods. 

If you visit Vegas and you want Thai food, YOU SHOULD GO HERE.

{"text":"Really Really bland and boring. Service blah, slightly rude. Drive a few blocks over to spring mnt. Gets lots of business for $5.95 lunch special from harried healthcare workers."}
{"text":"The traditional decor and atmosphere give the sense that a family owns this restaurant and everyone likes a home cooked meal. They must also be very fun, judging by the disco ball and karaoke set up in the corner.   I was greeted by teeth and multiple voices emitting from the corner, welcoming me to their home away from home. 
     Upon reading the menu, I was happy to see a wide range of choices and flavors to explore. I decided that I would order the pad ke mow and compare to the many I've had. I was presented with a generous portion of my favorite dish and pleased with the flavor and level of spice. I didn't really like the garnish of lettuce surrounding my pile of perfection, but I ate it anyway. 1 out of my two refills came without effort, which is more than I can say for some others. 
      I have decided that it is a place that I wouldn't mind experiencing again if it happened to cross my path, only to try some other dishes. But I wouldn't drive across town for it."}
{"text":"Food was fast and delicious. I came here by myself ordered my normal tom yum w shrimp which was so good. The fast service was great since I came during a lunch break."}
{"text":"A nice Thai restaurant in mt.pleasant, this place looked familiar as it use to be a sushi restaurant I have been to before. There is a small parking lot in front of the restaurant as well as some street parking. I was able to call and make a reservation which was nice cuz the place filled up quick. Everyone decided on an appetizer to start. We got papaya salad, pin wheel, crispy wonton and money bags. I got the salad and the shreds of papaya was fresh and crunchy with each bite and the sweet and tangy fish sauce and Chilis was a nice balance and has pieces of sliced cooked shrimp which was really good. The money bags tasted like regular Chinese wontons to me, some girls thought the pin wheel tasted better. The crispy wontons looked really simple and something I could make at home so I wouldn't waste my money on it. Two girls got the pad se ew and they mentioned it was super yummy and finished their dish quickly. I got the pineapple fish which was nicely battered Basa filets fired up and tossed in this sweet and sour sauce with pineapples and green onions, I got a side of coconut rice and it was scrumptious. I had leftover that I packed up for lunch the next day. Service was good but I think they got a bit busy and forgot one of the appetizers after the other three already came out and we had to ask for it. Overall I quite liked this place and would totally go back."}
{"text":"First time here today. The pad Thai and cashew chicken was great! The atmosphere was quiet and the servers were very attentive. A very clean and crisp restaurant, and definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This is a new Thai cuisine bar. They have opened for three and half months. Their lunch specials are cheap and authentic. Also there are some really good appetizers. They have really good service. The thing I don't like is their environment. The whole restaurant is too dark."}
{"text":"No frills hole in the wall Thai restaurant. Have been by here a few times, because it is really close to my office. The main attraction here are the lunch specials that run Monday through Friday from 11 am to 3 pm where you can grab a lunch entree, egg roll and soup for $6.95. Have only been here for dinner once and thought the regular menu was pretty decent and the prices were generally under 10 bucks. I had the pad see ewe ($7.95) and although it wasn't a giant portion, it was enough to fill me up. Overall the food here is good, but there are definitely better Thai places around town. For the convenience and price though, this place will do whenever I'm at work or in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered the pad Thai and pad se ewe, level 4.  Both were good with perfect spice level for us. Would order the pad se ewe again. For a neighborhood Thai place, it is great."}
{"text":"First visit but it will not be our last. The food was probably the best Thai Food we have ever eaten. Chilli Club was our favourite but we now have a new one. Thanks for the great experience and we were lucky enough to have one of the two sisters that owns the restaurant as our server. She really made the experience very pleasant."}
{"text":"My family and I are visiting from out of the country but the service here is very welcoming and friendly.

We were seated right away and the food is outstanding!

Wish there were more restaurants like this in California"}
{"text":"Had the Pad Thai Noodles and Crab Rangoon. Very good!"}
{"text":"Don't judge this book by its cover.  It is in a non descript shopping center.  You walk in and say wow.  It doesn't end there.  We were on vacation from Florida and happened on this place by a Yelp ad.  Good reviews, looked sincere.  We were a group of 11 vegetarians and called ahead.  Owner picked and said she could accommodate us.   We started the spring rolls which were good, then came the Tom Yum and Tom Kha soups, both were balanced with spice perfectly.  Tom Yum was made with coconut milk which was surprisingly awesome.  Then came the dinner plates, Panang Curry, Green Curry and Red curry, along with veg pad thai and vegetable fried rice.  Our favorite was the Panang curry, the kids loved the pineapple curry fried rice (a little less heat was perfect for them).  This place a definitely a gem, we left jealous of the locals not having a place like this in Tampa."}
{"text":"Consistent American style Thai food.  Friendly service. Won't break the bank.  If you want a bit of inexpensive Thai and have people in your party that aren't very adventurous this is a good intro to Thai food."}
{"text":"This is the place that made me like Pad Thai noodle dish. I was never a fan of it till I tried theirs. When I lived in Vegas, I would stop by this place and enjoy good pad thai. I was in town last month and I made it a point to eat here but was I surprised. Not in a good way. The pad thai tasted different, bland and lacked flavor. So was the fried rice. Maybe it was just a bad day, maybe it was the understudy chef working the kitchen that day I dunno. But it still gets 4 stars because of my past experiences."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a group of friends while traveling thru Calgary.  Stopped in craving Thai food and choose Pad Thai primarily because it was close to our hotel. Was greeted by a friendly staff and a very fun and kooky waitress.  The food was excellent as well.  The sauces were flavorful, the veggies and meats cooked just right, and the service was excellent.  Overall we had a wonderful experience.  I would recommend Pad Thai to anyone and will stop by there again when in town."}
{"text":"I don't know the history behind this place, but the 1 and 2 stars are just not deserved in my opinion.  Yeah, its not the best Thai of Vegas, but it isn't that bad!  I ordered the green curry 7.50, along with a Thai iced tea ($2.50).  

The Thai iced tea was pretty good.  It was sweet and balanced with cream.  The green curry wasn't too bad at all.  I ordered it \"Thai style\", so I don't know if they make it differently normally.  The curry is not flashy with a lot of bamboo and a few thin slices of onion and red peppers.  The spiciness was above average in the flavor department.  The only complaint that I had was that the beef was too tough.  I let the friendly waitress know about this exception, so maybe they will up the quality of their beef.

An funny story, I forgot to bring my wallet.  When I went to pay, I realized I didn't have any money!  I asked the waitress to hold my phone so I could go home and get my wallet... luckily I don't live very far from here.  The waitress smiled politely and didn't make any argument.  She was quite understanding.  

I would like to come back here and try some more dishes.  I am hoping that they take my advice on the beef.  If they do, this could be quite a nice little spot.  There are a lot of Chinese dishes that I probably won't try, but it is still more authentic than the other (more popular) Thai restaurant in this area.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"We came here on our last day of vacation and boy did it not disappoint! Our food was excellent but the service cannot be beat. Our waitress was super friendly and took care of us very well. We talked a little bit with the owner after our food and this is just a very sweet family restaurant with love in every plate of food. Definitely a good find!"}
{"text":"good food.  good prices. If you are the type that judges the quality of food by decor,  don't come here.  This is a strictly tummy pleasing restaurant."}
{"text":"I am hooked on the Thai chicken salad with lime spicy dressing. Great summertime lunch."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Thai food I've ever had. My family and I traveled here from Toronto. I've  always been a big fan of Thai food. I'm also very familiar with Thai ingredients. I have tried the best rated Thai food in Toronto, but it's nothing like this. By eating their food I can tell the chef really put her heart in making the food and developing the menu. Their appetizers are delicious and unique. None of the Thai restaurants I tried before would put that much effort to make such sophisticated dishes. Their portions are huge. I felt really bad that we wasted some food, because we have early flight the next day. But I seriously don't remember the last time I ate as much. Highly recommend the Tom Yum Goong soup, if you don't try it you don't know what you're missing ! The restaurant is also very clean and tidy. Overall, I wish they open one in Toronto."}
{"text":"Good prices and awesome service. Very friendly wait staff. The chicken satay appetizer and cashew chicken entrée are the stars of the show. The Mongolian beef is bland. Love the Thai iced tea here, super sweet and creamy with just the right hint of smokiness."}
{"text":"The moment we walked into this restaurant we did not get a hello or a welcome. She walked us over to a dirty table with a whole bunch of food on the floor and tossed our menus onto the table and walked away. The restaurant was empty and she sat us at the messiest table. She had a terrible attitude so we didn't wait for her to come back we just left. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly and helpful service staff, with decent tasting dishes. Be prepared for small portions, though!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pad Thai, vegetable fried rice and chicken with vegetables.  The food is very good, the flavors are on point. The only thing is that I'm used to pad Thai being thick noodles and they serve theirs with glass noodles but the flavor was good that I didn't mind it."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch take out and was sadly disappointed. The restaurant has only one party of 5 there and yet upon entering I seemed to disturb the person at the counter. I had to specifically ask for the lunch menu and I ordered Pad Thai figuring I cannot go wrong with the item the restaurant is named after, right? Well, it was ok. Not something I'd ever go back for. I asked for spicy and I got sweet. I know pad Thai is supposed to have that beautiful hint of sweet but there was nothing spicy about my meal and it could have used quite a bit of salt to bring out the flavor. The Thai egg roll was very soggy and bland also additionally it didn't come with any sauce. (Weird, right?) 

I think moving forward I'm gonna stick to Weera and Lotus for all my Thai food needs."}
{"text":"I have to find a better place closer when I work near this location.  I keep settling which is not like me. Each time I come back the food is of poor quality and never seems completely to recipe.  Service is lacking."}
{"text":"$8 for the lunch special that includes fried rice, soup, spring roll and you can choose from about 20 different dishes. I ordered the fried rice with egg drop soup and garlic pepper chicken. It was very flavorful and the portion size is big."}
{"text":"I think the old chef was better than the newer one. I love their customer service. The boss was awesome!"}
{"text":"It was ok. I always have such high expectations that sometimes I need to tell myself to slow down on being so critical
. I ate. I am happy :)"}
{"text":"I ordered take out from here when in town on business and it was really good. I started with the Salad Rolls, which seemed expensive until I saw how many I got. I also had the Pad Thai which was really good.

It was a bit expensive but I could have had lunch the next day with the leftovers if I wasn't flying out. With a second appetizer or salad, it would have been enough for 2."}
{"text":"When you can hear the sound of the mortar and pestle, you know that they are doing things the traditional way. I must say that I have not tasted a lot of the menu as I've only gone there by myself twice and as much as I like food there is a limit to how much I can eat. I've tried the Pad Thai and the Papaya Salad, the flavours are fresh and intense. This is my favourite Pad Thai of all the ones I've tried in this city, it doesn't have any tomatoey taste and uses all of the proteins: tofu, chicken, shrimp unlike many places that offer a choice of one. The papaya salad was fresh and flavourful and could have been just a pinch spicier but I wasn't sure of the spice levels and so will know for next time. The service is excellent. I think they were smart to offer a selection of items that are different from the ones you find at all Thai restaurants such as their Signature Shrimp Rolls which are fried ground shrimp, water chestnut wrapped with seaweed paper served with sweet chili cucumber sauce. Lunch specials are a few select items for $12 each. I've also tried the Tom Yum Goong with noodles which is their regular Tom Yum soup but served with noodles. The menu is not as extensive as other Thai restaurants but I prefer that a place do a limited number of things well."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Their chicken wings are amazing, we asked for them extra crispy. Also love the Won Ton soup, friend rice, and pad thai. The lady who runs it has remembered us every time. Close to University Medical Center."}
{"text":"It was my suggestion to change it up for lunch for the offices Thai Thursday.  This tucked away spot nestled in the far corner of a busy shopping complex makes for a parking challenge only experienced during the holiday season in popular shopping locations.  With surgical centers in close proximity, you will have to slow roll through a gauntlet of wheel chairs and walkers that is reminiscent of a zombie apocalypse.  

Once a parking spot was secured we walked into a clean restaurant with an eager to please staff.  We were seated immediately and had drinks in minutes.  The lunch specials are priced at 6.95 and it is a generous portion.  I had the chicken fried rice lunch special with a spicy level of 3 out of 5.  The meal was two clicks above mediocre.  As I muscled through the meal the proverbial  mind screw kicked in when my friend, who ordered the same thing, spit out an object.  This object was undoubtedly a good size chunk of brill o.  At that same moment my other friend who ordered the same dish had a puzzled look on his face.  As he worked the unknown item to the front of his mouth, he retrieved it and looked at it as if it was a riddle.  Perplexed we were as we tried to identify this alien object that could have been anything from petrified chewing gum to a chicken bone.  Check please! Lunch was over. We notified the staff and they were genuinely embarrassed.  They refused to allow us to pay for the imperfect meals.  That will be it for me and the Pad Thai Restaurant."}
{"text":"First time coming in here. Small spot, but plenty of tables and has traditional decoration all around. I was indecisive about getting the lemon chicken or red chicken curry for a lunch special, so i asked for their suggestion. Told me to go with the red chicken curry. Lunch special comes with a salad, soup, egg roll, rice, and your choice of entree. The food gets you full and it is pretty good! Only for fall is the wait, but I think that's just because I came in during the lunch rush. All in all, a definite recommendation to eat at when in the area."}
{"text":"Nice little restaurant. Very quaint, and nicely decorated in Thai themes.
Our waitress was very good and was very witty, which earned her an extra tip. 
The menu is extensive and the food quality is quite good. I found the serving sizes to be rather smallish, especially for the price. All of us could have eaten more than our dishes provided. We had appetizer, entree and dessert and I still could have eaten more at the end of it. I am a petite female, just so you know I am not a 200 lb. man!
The food was nicely seasoned, but inconsistent in the \"hot\" ratings. Each of us had entrees that were rated \"one pepper\", but mine was the only dish that had any heat at all. Some hot sauce served on the side might have been a good idea. 
If you are going to go, have the Thai bruschetta, it is killer. The dessert, sticky rice pudding with fresh mango, was very small I found. For $8 I would have expected a more sizeable helping, especially since the main ingredients - glutinous rice and coconut milk - are widely available and very inexpensive. 
Overall, a pleasant restaurant, and nice tastes. But if you are starving, you may have to stop for takeout later."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by fellow Yelper Michelle J. and what a good recommendation it was. We walked in right as they opened at 11 o'clock. We were greeted and seated promptly and provided with menus. 

They have  a good selection of $6.95 lunch options.  I opted for the Sweet and Sour Chicken. The lunch special comes with a small little salad and soup in addition to an egg roll. The portion size of the entree was good and it was served hot and fresh. Lunch for two with beverages was less than $19 out the door (not including the tip). 

Word on the street is they get really busy during the lunch rush. Get there before noon and that shouldn't be an issue. I will definitely return and try another dish on the menu. Solid meal and solid service. I'd give it a solid three and a half stars and have no problem rounding up."}
{"text":"Stopped in for take out to bring home my family something good for lunch.  Thought I'd give this place a try since I was in the area.  Although, I did not eat inside the restaurant everything from the outside looked clean and the person who took my order at the front was prompt.  Stepped out for a bit to do grocery at Smith's while food was prepared & before I knew it my order was good to go. Everything I ordered was tasty: panang chicken, combination pad see ewe, pad tofu, and steamed white rice.  These were family style entrees which could feed 4-6 depending on serving size. Had an excellent visit and the food I received was good for the price I paid, be back for more items next time!"}
{"text":"Prices are a bit higher than what I'm used to. Standard items like fried rice and lunch specials are about $9."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here a few times for lunch when i was stationed nearby. It's typical Americanized Thai food, complete with the tasty fried rice, hot and sour soup and spring rolls that you'd be just as likely to find in a Chinese restaurant. The actual Thai food isn't bad though, but like I said is far from the real deal. The portions are small but appropriate for lunch. For about 6 bucks you can get a roll, soup, salad, rice and entrée. Its a pretty good deal and is far preferable to eating the same old subway or pandas express. Foodies don't bother but casual lunch hour folks might be interested--it's a hell of a lot better than going to freakin' Subway again. If you aren't in the nearby area however, don't bother making the trip for this unremarkable Thai food."}
{"text":"The best Thai in Calgary. A simple menu with plenty of choices and every dish is done well."}
{"text":"I live close to this place the food is descent but I have asked them on a couple of different  occasions  to clean  the damn restroom and they don't seem to care"}
{"text":"Great restaurant/food and everytime I eat here I get wonderful service.  Proves to not ever judge a book by it's cover. (That's why it's missing a star)  Great prices, especially the lunch menu.  I only like two Thai restaurants in Vegas and this is one of them! =)"}
{"text":"Very middle of the road experience for me. Don't get me wrong, I've never had a bad time here.. it's just okay Thai food and there are definitely places I prefer over it. 

It's very convenient for me since the hospital I rotate at and some of the clinics are so close to Pad Thai so stopping by for lunch is very nice. But on the other hand, this place can get very very busy because of that during that lunch rush of employees.

They have lunch specials that have smaller portions of certain dishes but come with soup, salad and an egg roll. I've had their chicken pad thai and yellow curry. The yellow curry veggies were too soggy and overcooked which I don't really enjoy.. :(

Service is nice and quick so they have that going for them.. All in all it, I think this place is just ok and I'm not sure if I would return unless someone else was really craving Thai food close by."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Thai food with actual Thai owners and chefs, can't ask for more. All of the curries are made in house and toasted per order. They even import their own white cardamom for their spices, which is unique and authentic to Thai cuisine not found in North America. Make sure you stop here if in Calgary, and try their signature dishes like their pad Thai, made with in house tamarind sauce."}
{"text":"Just ate the combination pad Thai spice level #4 out of 5. I give it a 7 for price/value. They charge an extra $3 for combination pork, chicken, shrimp. Paid over $11 for this plate. Maybe it's the noodles. They use the very thin rice noddles (see picture) and I may not be a huge fan of this noodle. A solid 7 on taste. Most Thai places I've eaten at serve a generous portion of the bean sprouts and sprinkle of peanuts. These items were almost non-existent in this plate.  

See my other reviews of Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Had dinner with friends here. The staff was extremely friendly. I had a vegetarian pad Thai and tried some of the papaya salad. The papaya salad was very nice. The pad Thai was good as well. The portion sizes were big. Would be visiting again."}
{"text":"RUN!! Overpriced, small portions, attitude, cold food... Good place to go if you'd like to be MORE hungry when you leave then when you walk in. Serves \"hot\" food on ICE cold plates then wonders \"Why you send back hot food? Feel bottom of plate... very hot!\" \"But the rest of the plate is cooling off the rest of the semi \"hot\" food! Heat it up\"

NO WONDER THE PLACE WAS DESERTED! Lol"}
{"text":"For real, a tiny little hole-in-the-wall type place.  Tiny!  But does have quite a few tables, and the lunch rush is probably when it's most busiest here at Pad Thai Restaurant.

Came with the wifey for a quick weekday lunch, opting for one of their various specials for only $6.95.  With the lunch special you get:  choice of several different entrees, fried rice, hot & sour or egg drop soup, and a small house salad.  Not a bad deal per se, but with the number of all-you-can-eat Chinese buffets around this area, Pad Thai Restaurant does fight for patrons.  Just saying!

Their lunch service is quick, you really can be in and out of the restaurant within 30 minutes.  I had the lunch special of their Kungpao Chicken, and it was a bit underwhelming.  The portion size was OK, I would have expected more on the plate.  The flavor was good and not overly salty, but there were too many undercooked & crunchy carrots and celery in the dish.  Not enough time in the wok!  The over crunch made the dish texture somewhat off.  Not my favorite dish, should have gone with their namesake and ordered the pad thai!  Their fried rice was very good though even if it was a simple interpretation, I think a touch of fish sauce may be what adds flavor to it.  The egg roll?  Tasty!  I was surprised, it might actually be fresh made instead of frozen.  Props to that.  The hot & sour soup was also a surprise, it was indeed hot AND sour, but not overpowering on either end.  Even the simple salad was good with their house dressing.  If I had to guess there is some mayonnaise in it.  Tip, add some black pepper to the salad, kicks it up a flavor notch.  Overall I enjoyed the side dishes with the lunch special more than the entrée itself, hence the lower star rating.  It's partially my fault though, why order a Chinese dish in a Thai establishment?  Next time I will stay with Thai!  Maybe a curry!

'Thai' this place out for a fast, easy lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden in the back of a large shopping so you've probably driven by and not even realized it. They have $7 lunch specials that are very filling and yummy. I had the chicken Pad Thai. The heat-o-meter was painfully deceptive! I like heat in my food but decided to be cautious and ordered a Level 1 (their scale is 1-5, rather than 1-10 like most places). Level 1 gave quite a bit of heat. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't prepared for that much heat. I think I'll order it plain next time but I will most definitely return! Lunch for 2 with drinks for less than $20? Can't go wrong there! Down side? Very few employees so if they get busy then you might be waiting a bit."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. Super quick service. Good was really good. Got chicken Pad Thai at a three and it wasn't very spicy. Probably the best in the area that I've had."}
{"text":"So good and the waitress was hilarious. Had the pad thai and it was so yummy and fresh. Loved it! Will def go back"}
{"text":"People love a story of redemption. If you are one of those people, this review is for you.

My relationship with Pad Thai is a tumultuous one.  When I first started eating here, typically delivery, I was almost always satisfied.  The food was good.  The quantity was generous.  The price was fair.  No problems really.  Then one day I noticed the prices going up.  Inflation is a necessary evil I suppose.  But more than the irritating price increase was the noticeable decrease in quantity.  Not long after came the most aggregious of offenses.  I started receiving food I did not order nor wanted.  This was the last straw.  For a while at least.

A couple of months ago, after about a two year boycott, my office mates and I returned to Pad Thai.  Not with the delivery orders this time but actually dining in the restaurant off the lunch menu.  We were so impressed that we have been back a couple more times.  The service is fast and friendly and the food is delicious.  The portions look small but it is a deceptive illusion.  Leaving the restaurant I find myself full.   I have ordered three different menu items and have not been disappointed in any of them.  I've had the sweet and altogether comforting panang curry, the ever classic and eponymous pad thai, and a new one for me, prik-khing.  I am a curry nut and apparently this is a type of curry though it really didn't taste like any curry I am used to.  Regarless, it was great and will certainly be added to my regular Thai staples.  The only real source of disppointment here is with the salad.  It is so small and insignificant.  At least the soups, both hot and sour and egg drop, are pretty good and make up for the salad.

Yes, Pad Thai has risen from the ashes to grace our palates once again.  It will continue to do so until such a time comes that they tend towards their past offenses.  I can only hope this does not happen.  I am back on the Pad Thai train and I don't wanna get off."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and like that it is close by in the neighborhood. I have enjoyed my visits but feel that, compared to other Thai restaurants in the area, it is a bit pricy. The Tom Kha Gai is very good with just the right amount of heat,  but it is a bit too brothy with not enough chicken. The Pad Thai is okay but not memorable. After discovering Weera Thai, not much farther away, I found that the food, quality of service, and price overall here was lacking. The prices there are very comparable and the food a lot better.

I keep coming back though... when you aren't in the mood for a hustle of a meal, the atmosphere here is very chill. Excellent for lunch, especially...!"}
{"text":"Ok food but it depends on the day.  Also ordered to go and the front desk lady threw my card on the counter and refused to pick up the pen after I used it. Germaphobe or just silly. I know how germ filled desk pens can be but that's what soap and water is for. Not sure which one but it's my last time."}
{"text":"Had the best pork fried rice I've had. Large pieces of meat in the rice and large food portions. The sesame chicken was ok had to bring most of it home...recommend eating it when its first served not so good if you have to heat it. I'll be back again with a bigger appetite ."}
{"text":"This place is terrible with the blandest of the bland pad thai. My husband and I checked out the place since we work and live in downtown and were looking for a good neighborhood restaurant. When we walked in, we should have been clued in immediately when we noticed the entire place was empty and it was during prime lunch hours.  Our suspicions were confirmed when two platefuls of pale looking noodles with nothing else but pale looking noodles stared back at our disappointed pale noodle hating faces. Never again, peddlers of bland noodles. How you stay in business is as much as a mystery as the Bermuda triangles."}
{"text":"The restaurant is decorated really nicely and the food was amazing!! The pad see hew was good as well as the pad Thai and the curry chicken"}
{"text":"Everyone is friendly and willing to give advice on my to-go orders.  For instance, Pad Thai wasn't recommended since I had told the lady it might need to be re-heated.  She said a wider noodle like a Pad See Ew would hold up better.  It's the same price, so it wasn't like she wanted to up-sell me.

The food is always done on time and the people were nice enough to run my credit card number even when I forgot my wallet at home.  All in all, I've been there about 6 times and never really had anything to complain about.  It's always legit food.  

One con - Seems like a more family-run business and doesn't have a hand-out menu.  Sometimes I call in orders while at the gym.  I have to look onto the website to get the info.  It would be easier if I had a menu on hand."}
{"text":"Thank you fellow yelpers. In Vegas for work and looking for a good local place to have lunch. Checked yelp under best restaurants and this place popped up. 

The 5 star reviews are spot on. Here is what I had and reviews:

Panang curry with beef - very tender beef with no fat. Panang was great and tasty and with a spicy of #3 it was perfect. After 3 or 4 bites the heat built up on my tongue. 

Tom Ka soup with shrimp - very deep flavor with onions, tomatoes, chicken, mushrooms.  Some of the best Tom Ka soup I have ever had. 

Pineapple fried rice - never thought raisins in the rice would work but outstanding flavor. Pineapples, cashews, shrimp, roast pork, carrots and scallions this was a delicious mix of Flavors. 

One note is that if you order the lunch special the portion is small. Didn't matter because I ordered so much food but if I just had the lunch special I might have needed to order more."}
{"text":"Avg. Not terrible. I had the larb... It was close to delicious."}
{"text":"Normally thai good isn't prepared great.  This place.sets the standard for me.  I got the lunch special chow mein.  Loved it.  My new favorite chinese / thai food."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant and staff was friendly. Food was a little sweet but still delicious. My favorite was the shrimp rolls and crispy won ton. The pad Thai was ok it could a little more spice"}
{"text":"Wow! I remember this as a sushi restaurant. The new tenants have kept much of the old decor but has added lots of Thai influences to freshen it up. Our two servers were the owners and they were delightfully excited to see us and keen to share with us their suggestions for food and their inspirations for the menu. I had the pork stay skewers for a starter and they were on point - a little hint of heat and all the peanut flavour I craved! For my main course I chose the eponymous Pad Thai as the photos made it look so inviting - what I got what picture perfect and had all the flavours I had imagined and the textures made it a delight to eat! The serving size left me feeling full. No room for dessert. Thank you! I will be back as I love this place!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food cooked by the sweetest Thai lady! This placed passed my \"authentic Thai food\" test: the Pad Thai wasn't bright orange like some other places. Authentic Pad Thai should be more of a brown color, which it was here.

The chef came out and checked in on us, which was a nice touch. She told us that her mom who lives in Thailand sends her authentic ingredients! The chef also makes her own amazing hot sauces and pairs them with the different dishes. I do wish the portions were a tad bit bigger (mainly because the food here is so delicious!). I've had some amazing Thai food in CA but I was indeed blown away by this little Thai joint in Calgary! Don't let the unassuming exterior fool you!"}
{"text":"I have some hugely mixed feelings on this restaurant. First of all, it was over 110° outside. When I walked inside the restaurant, it was not much cooler. So we sat down and had to ask for menus. After ordering my food I asked the waitress if they could turn the air down because it was way too hot inside. It did seem to get a little bit cooler then so I let it go. But more on temperature later.

The Thai food was actually pretty good. I got the panang curry chicken and I had ordered a medium spice. It's seemed to be the right amount of heat for medium. It was on the lunch menu, and it came with soup, salad and a side of rice. Not bad for the price.

The concern came later when we had ordered dessert. We ordered the fried bananas with ice cream. When the dish came, the ice cream was almost completely melted. The waitress did remove the extra charge for the ice cream. But my concern was, is it just that hot in the kitchen or was the refrigeration equipment not working? It was still pretty warm in the restaurant. When I stood up my pants were sticking to my legs from sweat."}
{"text":"Panang curry all day everyday!!  I love the daily lunch special and the staff is quick and friendly.  Try to make it here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for years on a regular basis. Chicken pad thai and the panang beef curry are some of my favorite meals in Vegas. The staff is friendly and learns what the \"usual\" orders are, it's one of the few places where I feel like they know me."}
{"text":"It used to be really good and we went regularly, but after our most recent visit, we don't have the same enthusiasm. We typically order the panang beef, chicken in a farm, pad see ew, and house Thai salad. The food is okay and satisfies are cravings, plus the price is fitting. The dining area is never busy as most of the time people order to go. If you're craving Thai and don't want to pay outrageous prices, I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"This was on February supper club adventure.  We can not go any further without mentioning our server Wasanna - who was one of the most delightful and helpful servers we have ever had.  She made the place as special as the ambience and the food.    We ate a real mix and  everything was absolutely excellent (especially the fish) - however the Pad Thai itself wasn't the most special item - and we wished it was. Our table of 8 rated the entire experience an average of 8.75/10.  I have already sent 3 people to check out Pad Thai in Calgary."}
{"text":"Your typical neighborhood Thai/Chinese/Asian in general place offering mediocre, Americanized food with mediocre service. Came here again after a so so experience during lunch, and even though the restaurant wasn't busy, the service was very slow. We didn't order off of the lunch special menu bc they seemed to taste worse than the regular one. Ordered soup and fried rice to share, and the little plates that they gave us were dirty with sweet and sour sauce. Gross. The waitress offered no apology but just that typical stern look like we were a bother. The food quality was mediocre. When it came time to pay, we had to go behind to find someone bc they all disappeared. Awful awful awful."}
{"text":"Very good costumer service; clean facility: the food is really good, their Panang Curry and Pad See Ewe are one if my favorites. It's a must try; their lunch special are a really good deal as well only 6.95. To add to it they have a good delivery system nice and quick if you work close to the 89106 zip code."}
{"text":"My wife and I have went there twice now for lunch.  I love their panang curry, and my wife loves their food too!  I love the fact that they ask you how how you want your spicy food, and will kick it up a notch if you want.  The lunch special is worth it, and service is good."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Took a long time between ordering and receiving food. Food was warm, not hot. Meal came out before appetizer. Menu does not include papaya salad, Thai beef jerky or sticky rice. Chicken dish lacked flavor. Price reasonable."}
{"text":"I order red curry from the lunch special the serving was to small. I understand its a lunch special but in other places they serve a little bit more. When I order red curry the lady didn't even ask me how spicy do yoi want it. So I ask the guy that was cleaning the tables do you offer spicy level here from 1 to 10 he said yes 1 to 5 so I told him I wanted a 5 when it came out it was not even spicy. A other thing when I got my egg roll, salad and soup with the lunch special the spoon for the soup had a stain on it like it hasn't been wash so I ask for a other spoon . Also nobody came to my assistant's till I finish my food didn't ask me for water or anything esle while I was eating. I rather go to a other thai place to go eat. There's other places that serve good thai food. I gave it 2 stars because I eat the curry and rice that was ok but not grear. There thai ice tea was good. We'll good luck on your visit there."}
{"text":"I had never had Thai before. Went there with my fire station crew after a fire. Was very impressed with the portion size and the quality of everything we ordered. Very nice place and I will most certainly be back."}
{"text":"One star ratings because I hiked over .5 miles to get to this location to find that it no longer is there. There is construction going on right now. I ended up going to the Chinese restaurant next door and it was pretty good. I will rate that separately."}
{"text":"Worst Thai food I've ever had. First time I tried them the food was bad, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt, unfortunately it was just as bad. I even ordered something different."}
{"text":"Pad Thai opened recently and my wife and I thoroughly enjoy their food. Fresh and tasty, and their staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Love this place!"}
{"text":"The food was decent and commensurate with the price but the poor service was hard to overlook. Examples include: seating guests out of order at the same sized tables, walking away and turning around while speaking to them, inviting me to sit at a table whose surface still hadn't been cleaned from the previous guests, getting my order wrong, and haphazardly putting a place setting on the table instead of at my spot. 

Would love to return since there are so few eateries convenient to my work but I won't be coming here too often.  FWIW, this represents the most common mistake restaurateurs make: failing to understand that servers need training."}
{"text":"I had come to this place before and it wasn't my favorite place to have Thai food. After I was done with my appointment at the SW medical center, I stopped in here for lunch. I was hoping the food was better. To my disappointment - the tom yum soup was not any better. $9 for a bowl of tomato soup that is called tom yum. The shrimps were overcooked! I have been to many Thai restaurants & had Tom Yum soup so many times at different places. I have to say Tom Yum soup here is my least favorite. It was definitely not worth $9.

Not just the food I wasn't happy with, the customer service wasn't good as well. The waitress was a Thai lady with heavy makeup, looked like in her 50s. She wasn't friendly or pleasant. Not sure what her issues were, not even a smile in response when I said hi to her.

I'm usually a good tipper, but I didn't tip at all today. You gotta earn for your tips. Tips aren't entitlement just because you are a server you know?!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this restaurant 5 stars because the service is excellent. 5 stars isn't always about the food but the service and yes the food is delicious. I always order the same thing, Green Curry Chicken or Beef and the fried shrimp appetizer. 
The establishment is clean and very quiet, which I was looking for today.
Highly recommend if you're in the downtown area or just looking for some good authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"It's Sunday night, we just got back from a day trip from lake Louie and lake moraine, checked into hotel with my wife and in-laws. Just trying to find something the chomp down. Here we are, first pulling into the parking spot in front of a small plaza... absolutely zero expectation from then. But once I step into the restaurant, the aroma transcend this place was amazing, I knew I come to the right place...(wife elbowing me and said told you so) the waitress was informative, funny and friendly, they are dress in Thai dress. We order the wonton, green papaya salad and the shrimp drumstick and Tom yum goong soup. The appetizer is just amazing, I had to pretend that I didn't eat any (I ate two) in order to convince my wife that she had two and I should eat the last one. Lol. The Tom yum goong soup is unlike the ones I had before in Toronto, this had coconut milk in it and it had just enough kick of spice in it to balance the flavor. My definite flavor. We order the the green curry, red curry, yellow curry and pad se ew. They have the choice of coconut rice or jasmine rice. I found the coconut rice goes well with the curry, making it less spicy. The jasmine rice just make you taste the curry, they are so so good. The portion is huge!  This is probably the most authentic Thai food I had in a long while. Oh and the decoration of the restaurant is great, very well thought out."}
{"text":"WOW, change of ownership ruined this place.
My friends and I go here for lunch every week, the last time we went, they had new menus and different staff- we assume there is new ownership. They lost my friends credit card, didnt offer to cover her meal, messed up orders, and took abotu 3 times as long as they usually do.. They were unapologetic about losing my friends card. Such a disappointment, they will no longer be getting our service."}
{"text":"If you want to spend $15 plus for a tiny curry dish that's very watery, no rice and have the lid not be sealed on the take out order properly so half of it spills in the bag, order from here. Wasn't even that good. I'd take Tuk Tuk over this place any day."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure they were open when I arrived a few minutes after 11am on a Tuesday, their stated opening time. From the outside, there were no open sign visible as I walked up. But as I tried to open the door and it yielded, I knew it was not a complete waste of time to locate this small family operated Thai restaurant.

Majority of the review said it was a whole-in-the-wall operation, but Pad Thai Restaurant looks like many other ethnic casual dining restaurants with a limited interior decorating budget. There are no elaborate murals, Thai elephant sculptures or paintings or photos of famous Wat (Thai temples) or even portraits of the beloved Thai monarch, which are common decorative items found in many other Thai restaurants.  So the ambience was not a high priority item for the restauranteurs, but I don't see that as anything major that would detract from the dining experience.

One of my first impression is that for a small sq footage restaurant, they sure were able to arranged a lot of tables and chairs into the dining room. Maybe the health code was not as draconian and anti-small business when this restaurant opened, compared to present day. But that is a great thing for customers during their lunch rush (I was out before noon, so hardly witnessed or experienced this firsthand), when the restaurant gets packed from the many medical offices that are located within walking distance.

I opted to check out their lunch menu (19 options to choose from), which is priced at $6.95 and is available from 11am to 3pm. It is served with a choice of soups (Egg Drop or Hot and Sour were my options), a side salad, plus a Fried Egg Roll. No rice is served if a Fried Rice or Noodle dish is selected, which is indicated on their menu.  After mulling over my options I settled on their Panang Curry (which is mildly sweet) with Fried Rice.

My soup and salad were served quickly and the entree didn't take too much longer. The portions are not huge, but enough to fill the tummy without making people feel too sluggish to go back to work.

I enjoyed the Panang Curry, which was not that spicy at level 2 (5 is their max). The Fried Rice was decent, but I found bits of those old crystallized rice in there (maybe 7-8 grains total found their way in), which was the only negative part of my dining experience.

I didn't have high expectations like I would have if I was going to Lemongrass (Aria) and splurging, so in spite of the bits of hard rice that I had to orally sort out, it was still A-OK for the taste and value.

If you do decide to stop by for a quick lunch, get there before noon. Parking was scarce even at 11am, so keep that in mind."}
{"text":"Great food, great value, great service. I eat here about 5x a month - 3 lunches, two dinners. Complete lunch special - including small salad, soup, egg roll, fried rice and entree is only $5.95 - in an area where most sandwich shops charge that just for the sandwich. So lunch is usually pretty full - if you show up right at noon you will likely wait a few minutes for a table. Dinner is never a wait (in this area, that is true of all restaurants) and entrees run $8-12. Food is TASTY - best of the (10-12) Thai places I have tried in Las Vegas (most of which were much more expensive).

Downside? It is in a strip mall by a grocery store, and has the ambiance you expect in a strip mall - not a place to take a first date you are trying to impress. But if you want tasty Thai food that is inexpensive, come here (like I have been doing for two years - can't believe I never reviewed it before, but I usually only Yelp on vacation). Stands the test of time."}
