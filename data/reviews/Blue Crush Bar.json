{"text":"I think the food is very unique and interesting. They do have very good bands who play there, and have an open mic night. Anyone who would like a good night out I can guarantee, you will have a very enjoyable time in the North bay in scarborough."}
{"text":"Brand new in Scarborough part of the sands project.
In the summer, I couldn't find a nicer place to enjoy a coffee, pint or glass of wine.
Really well laid out, good price.


 Love the open mic nights on Thursday.


 Next step is to get a loyalty card and go down on a MOnday night."}
{"text":"Nice menu, great setting over looking the north bay. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Trendy surfers type bar, appeals to families too. Great food, good atmosphere. Often have live bands on esp at weekends, great views over north bay towards the Castle. Seating outside if its warm enough. Well worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Been here twice for food. Once when busy, once when quiet. Although the food sounded good, was lovingly presented, I found the chips to be quite possibly the worst I had ever had. It was obvious they had been cooked the day before and dropped in fat to reheat.
Haddock goujons in a Tempura batter with Home-style chips is fish and chips no matter what you do to it. The fish was nice but the batter was too thick.
On another visit I had a steak and onion sandwich which was nice except for the gristle. The prices are reasonable and the place is very tidy and clean.
Nice place to eat in the Sun and take in the views."}
{"text":"Stopped at lunchtime early in the season. Friendly staff, good selection of drinks and an eclectic and frankly wonderful menu. Has surfer written all over it but several older citizens were enjoying it as much as us non-surfer types with babies and toddlers. The Tahiti burger was up there with one of the best I have ever had. Well done!"}
