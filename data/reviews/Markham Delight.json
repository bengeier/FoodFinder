{"text":"Very good Cantonese Fried Noodles as well as General Tao with Shanghai Noodles!
Good Prices!"}
{"text":"This place is in the First Markham Place food court.  My mom had the Cantonese Chow Mein ($5.50) here and it came with a free soy milk.  I had a taste and it was delicious.

They are very generous with the toppings, which included shrimp, scallops, beef, squid, chicken, BBQ pork, bean curd, broccoli and mushrooms.  The noodles were crispy.  The sauce was piping hot and flavourful.  The Cantonese Chow Mein was much better here than at restaurants in Chinatown.  And so inexpensive!  

I will definitely return and order this again."}
{"text":"I love this place only for two reason...

First reason is the owners (the husband and wife) are very friendly....

Second reason is that they made one of the BEST \"Ma Po Tofu Rice\" in the GTA. 

The only down side is the waiting time since only two of them working....so if you know what you going to order, please call them and order in advance to avoid long waiting time.

P.S... if you like \"Ma Po Tofu Rice\", tell them \"Alan\" recommend you, they will cook you the BEST Ma Po Tofu ever."}
