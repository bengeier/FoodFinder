{"text":"Been there twice for dinner.  Atmosphere was great.  Great background music.  Service was impeccable.  The sushi I ordered which was not too complicated was delicious.  I would recommend it again."}
{"text":"So I guess this place has closed already? My co-worker tried to go there on Friday afternoon and said it was boarded up. This location really is cursed!"}
{"text":"I was there last night and it was just 'ok'. I know, sushi on a Monday is generally a bad idea but we were tired of walking around and not finding anything open.
First, the beer selection was strange. There were more domestic or non-Japanese beers than anything and I haven't seen that before at a legit sushi bar. I went for a \"Tiger\" when they didn't have the first two things I asked for.
The sushi was just ok. The cooked parts were over-cooked but when taken off of the roll, the roll was fine.
it took over 30 minutes to get our rolls which would have been fine had we not been the ONLY customers there who were ordering. There was one other table of 2 but they were wrapping things up and then a guy who came in for a draft beer and a semi-private cell phone conversation. It was pretty lame and the server didn't seem to care that the wait was so long when I passively mentioned it.
Last was the 20% tip that was included in the bill. That was lame. I wouldn't have give 20% and didn't appreciate my party of 2 being forced to do so.
I might just be used to CA and the sushi bars there but I think Charlotte deserves better."}
{"text":"I am not a fan.  I stopped by for their all-you-can-eat lunch for $9.95, and was sadly disappointed with the quality and selection.  The servers bring around trays of sushi and you select from what's on their trays.  The selection was poor (lots of CA rolls), the rice was way undercooked, and the flavors were not appealing.  On a good note, the servers were very pleasant and quick.  I just wish the sushi were better!"}
