{"text":"It was just okay... The other burrito places are better in my opinion.  Like Chorizo or Burrito Boyz or Much Burrito.  
Not much value for the money.  I was expecting higher quality.  I might go back to try the steak buritto though because they grill it to order.  Very competive space, this place needs to work on the flavours/value if they want to survive."}
{"text":"It was average.  The flavours are not there. I had the chicken burrito. I like burritos grilled on the grill with the cheese melted on the inside. Burrito boys is better but i will say the ingredients they do have are fresh and it is okay... They charge extra for grilled vegetables on the vegetarian burrito???? Huh? Doesn't make sense. What else is there? Cold veggies like subway sandwiches???"}
{"text":"This place is great..I always get the steak burrito ..the steak is fresh cooked to your liking, while you wait! I wish they delivered!!! Perfect location for them being across from a college though! 
Definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Just had a shrimp burrito here.  Was delicious.  Very fresh ingredients.  Prompt and friendly service.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Good take out place.  Good price and tasty.  Nachos have a kick!  Very fulling. Enjoy."}
{"text":"They make a good burrito here. Nothing fancy, typical setup with fast service where you choose toppings and its made quickly. Not quite as cheap as burrito boyz, but a good alternative for a quite bite in the area."}
{"text":"I have been going to Habanero for something like two years since it opened. I have tried over a dozen burrito joints around the GTA and Habanero is in the top 3. Out of those top three (chorizo, El sambrero, Habanero) they give you the best bang for your buck. All their toppings are fresh high quality ingredients. I don't even compare Habanero to the big chains like burrito boys. Good prices. Great food. I started doing the tacos now. You can get one of each meat to give a little variety."}
{"text":"Always fresh ingredients make the difference.  Great burritos and quesadeas.

No loud music and always has newspapers to read with meal!
Peter the owner is very friendly and open to suggestions!  Like a small town resteraunter!"}
{"text":"A fantastic place to get burritos. Tons of toppings, made fresh to order. One of the better burrito places I've been to!"}
{"text":"I am a frequenter of burrito places in the area and had the pleasure of trying this place. They have an excellent selection of toppings and everything is made fresh but the guacamole(which you have to pay extra for and why there is a point deduction). Thier shrimp burrito is excellent and their steak is cooked to order which is great. The chicken i think they keep in heat trays but i didnt try this. Their habenero has excellent kick to it. They are however a bit chintzy on the toppings and the burritos dont come out as big as other places but the flavour more than makes up for it. Also their burritos are a tad more expensive than my regular spot and considerably more expensive than burrito boys and again the quality more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Came to this plaza with the original intention to eat at Lourice's, but after reading reviews decided to give Habanero a shot and I'm sooo glad I did.

This place is pretty awesome! The service is excellent and the food is top notch. We tried Mexi fries with pulled pork, steak tacos and a steak burrito. The food was great! Steak and other ingredients tasted super fresh. Mexi fries were OK.

I'd recommend this place to anyone nearby craving tacos or burritos! This is the place!"}
{"text":"Was there Friday night and I ordered all the meat tacos including steak, pulled pork, chicken and beef. All were amazing and very delicious I should say that I was extremely high prior to ordering and was very satisfied with my ordering decisions. I would highly recommend this joint and will be back friday to try all the fishy type tacos."}
{"text":"These are the best burritos I've ever had! So many flavors! Mexi fries are bomb aswell!"}
{"text":"Umm I was really hoping to like this place but it was far from good. I ordered a small haddock burrito to go. Toppings were standard compared to other Mexican fast food chains (burrito boyz, chipotle, etc). Upon first bite you can instantly tell it lacked flavour (I got all the sauces) and the fish was HORRIBLE. The fish was super dry and you can tell it's been frozen for a long time. 

Will not return."}
{"text":"I purchased food for someone else.  Shrimp tacos one day, fish tacos another.  I'm told the food was AMAZING.  Portions were a bit small however.  I suggest getting a minimum of 6 shrimp or fish tacos as they're fairly small if that's the route you're going.

The place looks a little better than a hole in the wall, it's nothing special on the inside, and quite small.  But the quality of the food is big time restaurant status/quality.  Even the presentation of the food was excellent.  Customer service is better than average."}
{"text":"Well i was very disappointed they didn't have chipotle sauce on a side. The amount of sour cream was kind of poor too. Its a good place but still too much for what it is. There are cheaper places and as good as this or even better. So i guess not that hot...my poor jalape√±o"}
{"text":"The haddock burrito was good but their most popular burrito (chicken) felt like it had no flavour and was very bland (compared to chipotle). However I will be going back for the mexi-fries!"}
{"text":"I could eat here every day.
I'm not joking you, this is the closest to text mex I have found in Oakville that is manageable in reliability of taste and service. I usually have their shrimp burritos or burrito bowls, which are always fresh, and never heavy. A quick tip, always get the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Weak flavour. Truly bland and the spiciest additions did not adequately deliver the true flavour. Unevenly spread and not filling. 

Service is nice though. Food is not"}
{"text":"The most skinniest burritos I've ever tried. I would only recommend this place if you want to have a bad impression of TexMex food. Although stuff is friendly, their friendliness disappears as soon as they serve you those micro portions. I hope one day Oakville gets a Burrito Boys in town. There are not the best, but at least they're descent with their portions."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place since ice past it multiple times before and got more than I was expecting. The manager was very friendly and funny. The worker who made my tacos seemed to take time to get a good balance of ingredients as if they had worked it to a science but it was still fast service. Not to mention the taste was to die for!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place! Pricy for college kids but a great treat once in a while, and they give you a few chips on the side which is a lovely touch"}
{"text":"First time I came here I ordered the panko-crusted fish burrito. Most of the typical toppings you'd expect from a burrito place. I also like how they finish it in a Subway-type oven to quickly crisp it and warm it up. The panko taste really came through since it was actually a few small pieces of coated fish. As much as I love panko, it also took away the taste of the fish. I ordered the habanero sauce, but i found heat and overall taste to be lacking somewhat.

I returned a couple days later and tried the chicken. I asked for more hot sauce than before, as well as burrito sauce. Again, a pretty solid burrito, but nothing that really pops either. Perhaps I'll go with little to no rice if I return in case that is a cause; but that hasn't been an issue at other places I've enjoyed.

Reliable and better than some places, but still needs some more flavour."}
{"text":"Good burrito at a reasonable price. Will come back for more! Environment is cool. Small place right next to burger king on Trafalgar."}
{"text":"Super good burritos, steak cooked to order so no dried out warming trays. Meat quality was good and the preparation was perfect. Have been back 5 times since and has been very consistent.

A little on the expensive side considering size at other burrito shops, but not really an issue.

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really good. 

The steak burritos here are delicious. I get it medium rare it turns out great every time. 

I have also tried the pulled pork and chicken burritos those are also done really well too.

They take orders by phone. Do it to avoid waiting 5 minutes in line. 

Service is great, ingredients are always fresh. I visit once a month on a regular. 

A++"}
{"text":"Oakville doesn't really have a huge selection of good Mexican food, and The Habanero Taqueria doesn't really do much change that. Their Barbacoa burrito is the one item you've gotta try! It's the saving grace for this place, that and the exceptionally nice staff."}
{"text":"We ordered the pull pork mexi fries and steak tacos. The pull pork mexi fries were really good i would highly recommend it. As for the tacos just skip it.. Very very bland.. Three little tacos not worth it at all."}
{"text":"Not bad for Oakville and food was definitely fresh but I found the steak and pulled pork lacked seasoning. More expensive than Burrito Boyz or Fat Bastard Burrito with a smaller portion. Staff were friendly but overall pricey without a real signature item that would make me want to come back to it a premium. Good to try but won't be coming back often."}
{"text":"Just had the steak burrito bowl and it was amazing. You have two choices with the bowl - edible and styrofoam container. I went with the latter and I only wish it had been a plastic bowl at the very least; eating out of a styrofoam take out container is a bit unappealing. But I will definitely be back, steak was made to order and cooked perfectly, and the meal was very tasty and filling. 

The only thing that made it 4 stars was the styrofoam container and the fact that again, they keep on their plastic gloves for food prep AND money (and everything else) handling. What's the point."}
{"text":"Great burritos, fresh ingredients, and friendly staff. Love the variety of toppings and menu items including nachos and mexi-fries. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This is good for oakville. White people Mexican food. Nothing special. Each item about $2 over priced, $1.55 for a bottle of water.  Nice staff."}
{"text":"My favorite burrito place in Oakville! I'm a repeat customer due to the fact that they have great ingredient options. This is the only place I've seen offer 'pur√©ed black beans' as well as whole black beans for your burrito, or cabbage that gives your burrito a mildly sweet crunch, or steak strips! They also offer white or Mexican rice. I learned early that I didn't much like their burrito sauce; I originally thought it was goat yogurt until I asked and found out it was actually a garlic yogurt (I'm not sure why it tastes weird, it doesn't add to the burrito well at all). I also didn't care much for the coleslaw, which I noticed they don't always offer (but you can ask for! It's on the far right).

The meat options are tender and perfectly seasoned. If you order steak they will ask how you like it, and it comes out amazing (this one is my go to!)

If you want soft tacos instead of a burrito the portions will be the same, so don't fret! However I don't think this includes the rice, so these will be lighter than the burrito.

The nachos will include many (not all) of the burrito toppings, and will have cheese sprinkled on top and then baked. The chips have this spicy powder (cumin I think?) sprinkled on that gives it a nicer depth.

The staff there range from shy to extremely outgoing. They also don't seem to be forced to wear a uniform which I think makes the place seem relaxed.

Tip: the front door is super hard to open, and you have to pull harder than you originally think.

2nd Tip: Check to make sure you got everything, they forgot to give me chips ($1.50 so not a big deal) but I was so disappointed when I got home."}
{"text":"The food is great! Portions are huge and the burritos are rolled nice and tight.  No messy, drippy mess.   If you have lunch there, you're full for the remainder of the day.  Lots of vegetables to choose from and staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"We were in Oakville and hungry. Just saw this place on Trafalgar and tried it. Great Burritos.  Comparable to Burrito Boyz or FB Burritos.  They do have lots of other options than burritos.  So will try next time. Friendly staff. Overall good."}
{"text":"The burritos here are well crafted and delicious. So few places take the time to evenly distribute the toppings so that every bite is a balanced intake of awesomeness. 

Highly recommend the food, and a great selection of drinks."}
{"text":"4.5/5. My favourite burrito joint besides the late 'California burrito' also off of Trafalgar years ago. I prefer this burrito joint over muchos burrito, burrito master etc because the meat is fresh instead of having them in bins. It's all made to order. The actual restaurant is nothing to write home about but I rarely see a really nice burrito place. Only issue I have is the insulting amount of Tostitos they give with your burrito. It's almost on the side of funny. Last time I went they gave me 3 chips......."}
{"text":"Awesome food, got the shrimp burrito. The taste was the same all the way down to the last bite, top quality Burritos def one of my favorite. Still doesn't beat Burrito Boyz but its close. The only complaint and why Its not 5 stars is the price, one of the more expensive burrito places I've been, nestle water $1.55???? For a dollar more you can get a 24 of it... And you cant mix the meats and guacamole is extra... Good service inside very clean. Just price bugged me that a shrimp burrito with a water was $14"}
{"text":"Burrrrrrrrrritos! I do love having Mexican food and this place definitely satisfies. Excellent staff and very yummy burritos.

Also, try the Mexican fries. SO YUM!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican burritos ever! Oakville has a shortage of Mexican restaurants but this one makes up for it. Toppings are fresh and they're never stingy. Steak, chicken and shrimp are all fabulous and the burrito size is huge and filling. Some might think it's a bit pricey but it's so good I don't really care."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for quick Mexican, I come once a week. They're a little stingy with guacamole and salsa but that's my only complaint. Always friendly and the food's always good"}
{"text":"A very solid burrito place with good quality ingredients. Had the haddock burrito and fish was cooked nicely. 
Pleasant staff. Clean. Good beverage selection. Too bad not licensed for adult beverages."}
{"text":"This place was kind of expensive for what you got. I have to say Burrito Boys is a lot better, and a little cheaper as well. Main issue with this place was that every time you added something to your burrito it went up in price. After adding everything like guacamole and other toppings the burrito was like $12-15 with a drink. I ended up paying close to $25 for two burritos when I could have gotten two delicious burritos from Burrito Boys for only $19 with 2 drinks."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place for authentic burritos.
I could slap the person who suggested such crap.
As soon as I walked in and saw the teenagers making burritos I knew that was a lie.
I ordered the haddock (more like fish sticks) and my bf got the chicken. The burritos was lacking taste, flavour and most of all ingredients. They skimp on everything. Not only that they are so expensive for what reason though?
I usually go to burrito boys( only the one in port credit) and I'm always blown away. With not only service but quality AND quantity of food. This place was not somewhere I'd ever frequent. So I was quite surprised with the line up of customers. Don't even talk about customer service. They do bring the food to your table if you're dining in. but these employees do not smile or even attempt to make conversation with you in the least.
We also ordered the nachos, added chicken.
The chicken was so bland and a waste of money.
Majority of the food went to waste beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"Not bad. Prices are def a little off, '$1 extra for lettuce'...

The food itself is indeed fresh.  Fairly tightly rolled as well. Comparable to burrito boyz. Burrito bandidos is better. Portion size could be bigger."}
{"text":"The reasons for not giving them a 5 star:

1. Portion size of the styrofoam burrito bowl is very small. If ure going to compete with major burrito places, the current size won't cut it.

2. For the price, the amount of chicken in the bowl was extremely stingy. I love meat n im satisfied with other burrito places.

3. Customer service was not the best. My first statement was \"I've never been here before\". To that, there was silence.

Other than that, i really enjoyed their flavor."}
{"text":"Had the steak burrito - steak was cooked on order and cooked nicely. 

There was complaints from the others that I was with that the hot sauce was not spicy enough. Also, the food made some really dehydrated too. 

Overall, I was happy with the food I had. Would go back some time. Very comparable to other gourmet burrito places."}
{"text":"Love the burritos here! I drop by here for a shrimp burrito every couple of weeks after work and it's always delicious, but most importantly fresh!! All the veggies, rice, etc is as fresh as if you made it at home, it doesn't sit there for ages on the counter like at other places. The shrimp is sauteed in a sauce that has a bit of a bite to it, and it's really really good. The haddock burrito could be better, it's a tiny dry piece of fish that looks like it was from those frozen battered fish boxes at the grocery store. My husband loves the steak burrito which is grilled for you and you choose how you like it grilled. The nachos are awesome too. Staff is always friendly and efficient, and I rarely have to wait long. Prices are reasonable. It's not the best burrito I've ever had, but it's definately a GOOD burrito, it's fresh and delicious and I'd recommend it to anyone."}
