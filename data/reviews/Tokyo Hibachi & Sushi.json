{"text":"Service is really excellent.  They went out of their way to support any request we had.  The hibachi meal was very good.  The chef was fun and engaging.   Very nice evening out with my wife."}
{"text":"We have been here several times now, including tonight and once again the service and food were excellent!  While we sat in the grille area the first few times we came here, but that grew old pretty quickly, so now we prefer to skip the \"show\" and just sit in the regular restaurant area. 

My only complaint, and it's pretty minor, is that I wish the TVs were bigger. We always seem to be here when there's a big game on and if you aren't sitting right at the bar they are pretty hard to see. 

We also love that we no longer have to drive out of the city to find good hibachi anymore."}
{"text":"Just ate at Tokyo Hibachi with my wife tonight. Food was excellent, probably some of the best hibachi we have ever eaten. We have tried many other hibachi restaurants and this one is one of the best. Kevin the manager was extremely nice and the waitress Sophia was a good server. It is nice to see this kind of restaurant come to Medina and actually be a good option for dinner. Unfortunately they are not serving liquor yet but they do have their liquor license, they just need a good bartender to help them develop a good liquor menu. You will not be disappointed with this place. We will definitely be back and will be telling all of our local friends to check it out. FYI we got the gyoza appetizer which were very good and we both got chicken and steak hibachi. We did not sit at the hibachi table to watch the show because it was just the two of us but plan on bringing lots of friends with us next time to see the show. Thank you for a wonderful dinner."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch as a recommendation from a co-worker, and I'm glad I did. This place is beautifully decorated and the food was delicious. I got sushi and it was very well made. The price was also very affordable, and the staff was very professional and inviting. I don't have one bad thing to say about Tokyo, and I'm sure they'll make it as a new restaurant. I will be back to try the hibachi!"}
{"text":"Very cool interior. Traditional Japanese decor  and colorful lights throughout give it both an authentic and modern feel. I ordered 2 sushi rolls, both were very good and served in about 10 min. The staff was very friendly and courteous. There was a group at one of the hibachi tables, the food smelled great and the people were enjoying themselves with the show! Check it out."}
{"text":"Came in for some sushi and sat by the sushi bar.  Sushi chef was extremely creative in his presentation.  Sushi was fresh and beautifully displayed.  Since it was our first time in the chef gave us a couple complimentary tastings.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure that I'd recommend the hibachi tables, but I've eaten dinner and lunch here numerous times and never been disappointed.  The food is fresh and delicious, and the weekday sushi specials M-Th are amazing!"}
{"text":"after reading all the reviews of this place i had high expectations and they were definately met 100%. ive been to many hibachi restraunts and this is the best one ive had all around the chefs were funny engaging the waitress was great also. the food was terrific i will def be back many times."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Great service, excellent food, and the hibachi chef put on a good show.   The interior is very tasteful.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Everything has always been very tasty. Sushi to chicken teriyaki to bento boxes...you will want to try it all."}
{"text":"Very good service, great food. Hibachi was very fun enjoyed it alot. Clean and friendly staff. Food was good. I had the Hibachi steak with Fried rice and mixed vegetables I love the soup and salad was ok Wish I could have chosen my own salad dressing, I like the Yum Yum sauce but not the other sauce. The servings were huge had to take half home! Definitely will be coming back here."}
{"text":"Lunch was cheap but the food was not great. Sushi for 1.99 for a roll I should have know better"}
{"text":"Tokyo Hibachi & Sushi has amazing food. Big servings, and delicious sushi. I have not tried everything, but it is very good, I think that they added a little too much ground tuna on a my volcano sushi, so it's a little overpowering. But besides that I was happy. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I have only been to 2 habachi..this one (2x) and one in Akron (1x). We went at lunch time both times at this location and we were the only ones at the habachi grill both times at this location. With that said, the show was short lived but still fun. the establishment is very nice and very clean. Everthing we've ate and drank was amazing.. I think the onion soup is my favorite part of the entire meal. The ladies are extremely accommodating. My drink never sat empty and dirty dishes never laid more than a moment either. we will definitely return. I'd like to go at dinner time at some point also to see if the show is better with more of a crowd."}
{"text":"Tokyo Hibachi & Sushi has an excellent atmosphere and staff. There food is excellent and the hibachi side is the way to go. I have been here a couple times and every time that I have been here the food was very consistent in flavor and never different. Their staff are really good at what they do and always make sure that you have everything that you need. Best food in the Medina area!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My fianc√© and I go here at least once a week. It's usually not super busy and the staff is so friendly and quick! Definitely one of my favorites and recommend it often.
I enjoy Toyko more than Shinto!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite restaurant. The service is always great the chefs are always good and entertaining and I've never had a meal that I didn't finish. I consider myself to be a Hibachi aficionado, and ever since the hibachi restaurant near me closed  this has been the best one I found . Whatever you're doing keep doing it. Ask for Adam when you go"}
{"text":"This was by far my best sushi experience since moving back to Ohio from California. My mom and I stopped in for a little night out together, and we were blown away. First off, our server, Alexander was Awesome! He was very friendly, timely, thorough, caring, efficient, etc... Just about any good word you can think of would describe his sincere work ethic. The sushi master also did an excellent job making our rolls. Everything tasted amazing! Very reasonable prices $2 and $3 happy hour rolls (Cali Roll and Shrimp Tempura were a couple of our favs). We also loved the atmosphere and concept. We heard a lot of laughing/fun on the hibachi side and then on our side it was more relaxed and personal. This would be a perfect spot for a little intimate/romantic night out or with friends/family. Check out the pictures to help bring this wonderful experience to life."}
{"text":"Just when I thought Medina was entirely devoid of any halfway decent sushi places, Tokyo Hibachi and Sushi comes to the rescue. Well, actually, it quietly emerges from where it's been hiding from me between a KFC and cigarette store. 

The interior was a clean and quiet haven during the Friday lunch hour I decided to stop in. The hostess and my waitress were very courteous and warm, and brought all my food in a timely manner. I ordered the sushi roll lunch special, which came with two rolls of my choice, and either miso soup or a green salad. I opted for the salad, along with a spicy salmon roll and a tempura whitefish roll. Both were quite fresh and delicious, and left me with absolutely nothing to complain about. 

I left happy and full, having shelled out less than $15 for a great sit-down lunch. That's a definite win in my book, and I shall certainly be returning to this unpretentious hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi! Terrible service. The only server that was on had no clue what she was doing. And she seemed very stressed. She also never actually checked on me at all to see how I like my food. I realize it was a bit busy but still service sucked."}
{"text":"Don't judge from the outside! They have great hibachi prices compared to some of the larger chains, and the food is just as good. Their lunch hibachi prices are amazing! I would really recommend this place - a lot of people don't seem to notice it or even bother giving it a chance."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Sushi/Hibachi restaurant!  Lunch or dinner, always amazed at the service speed, especially on hibachi. Typical hibachi joint dinners can last 2+ hours.  Tokyo never rushes you, but more importantly, never makes you wait around for the next event/course. Gone with groups of 2 - 18, and always have had a great show and awesome meal. 

Prices are very reasonable for the amount of food, and cheap compared to most hibachi restaurants. Lunch specials are great (filet mignon hibachi lunch for $12?!?  Can't miss!)

Sushi is very, very good. Some nice specialty rolls with all of your standard favorites. Presentation is usually quite nice!  

Service is great, and the cooks are usually quite talented and fun. 

Very clean and nice ambiance. Management very friendly!

A great hidden gem in Medina!"}
{"text":"4 sushi rolls... 40 minutes... on a Monday evening when nobody was here. Good luck!

The hibachi here is pretty solid and the chef puts on a great show. Steer clear of the sushi simply due to time. No sushi rolls should take 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Great presentation.  Great food.   The hibachi side was packed on a Thursday night. The table service side had plenty of room.    Clean air compared to other similar style places.    Glad that we had a call-ahead."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and good food. Our cook was awesome. Interacted with the kids at our table, and had a personality - which is a must for an environment like this. Will be back for sure. Prices were reasonable. You MUST make a reservation. Tried last weekend without one and it was about an hour long wait."}
{"text":"Meh.  I did not do hibachi, so I cannot comment.  The sushi was OK.  I have had far better in Medina and CLE.  The tempura was cooked in old grease.  The only thing I could taste was the old oil.  One tempura item was cheese, (I think), it had no taste whatsoever.  my husband had udon noodles.  (The mouthfeel makes me think of eating worms.).  Since I don't eat them I cannot review them.  Since I was not wowed, I will not return.  The ambiance and staff was wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm very glad I followed the advice of other Yelpers about this restaurant.  It is hidden in a corner shopping plaza so it was a little tricky to find.  Once inside, we were promptly greeted and taken to our hibachi table.  The restaurant decor is contemporary without being overly formal.  Our waitress helped guide our selection in a signature roll and we went with the I Love You Roll, along with salmon sashimi and Naturo roll.  All three were beautifully plated and delicious.  The rest of our party (including kids) had varieties of hibachi meals, which they thoroughly enjoyed.  Lastly, it was my boyfriend's birthday and not only did they sing & play along with a Taiko drum, they brought out mini individual strawberry cake desserts for the entire party - first restaurant I've every seen do this! And, they were so yummy and perfectly sized.  It was worth our 30 min drive to get there."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming hear on Monday nights for the sushi specials.  Service has always been very good and the food arrives quickly.  I've only been here for the Hibachi once, but it was really good and a lot of fun.  Only complaint is the ice tea doesn't taste right, I think the machine needs cleaned."}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh tuna! Rolls are creative and delicious. Spicy Thai roll has fresh cilantro & boy is it tasty!! Service is prompt and friendly.

So, we ordered a lot of sushi...6 rolls. To keep us from waiting, we were served them as they were completed and i loved that idea!  Great job 

Tucked in a plaza and hidden gem status in my
Book!"}
{"text":"The steak was very good, the service was just okay mostly. The waiter refilled my water glass half full because we were close to the end of our meal. Come on dude you act like it's coming out of your private water supply. Our desserts were supposed to be warmer. My fried cheesecake was still frozen. My girlfriends caramel chocolate cake was still frozen. You can tell its a new place and they have kinks to work out. Our hibachi chef was not as charismatic as the ones at wasabi. I'll possibly check it out again"}
{"text":"The food was really good, better than I would have expected. The interior and ambiance is also nice. It's obvious the owner put a lot of capital into the aesthetics and decor. 

I've been to many hibachi restaurants and the 'show' at Tokyo was just ok. They did just open so maybe they're working out the kinks or developing their own showmanship style. 

The shrimp and scallop combination hibachi selection was awesome and had a great flavor.

The staff is friendly and eager to please, especially the gentlemen at the front who greets customers. He thanked us repeatedly for our business and as a consumer that goes a long way with me. 


I would definitely give this place a try, you most likely will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"While the interior of this restaurant has a very nice modern look it is severely lacking in customer service. We had made a reservation to celebrate my sister's birthday for 6pm for 7 people for hibachi, once we arrived at 6pm we were told we would be seated in just a few minutes.. After about 25 minutes of waiting we asked if we could sit at the bar to get a drink as well as how much longer the wait would be. We were again told we would be seated any minute. So we grabbed a drink which was decent at best and continue to wait as we saw at least three other parties that came in after us be sat at the hibachi tables.. 6:45pm rolls around and we have now spoken to the \"hostess\" on three separate occasions and yet again were told we would be seated any minute. We proceeded to tell the hostess we were very dissatisfied and we're going to go else where. She handled this EXTREMELY unprofessionally by subsequently arguing that it was our fault because our reservation was for 6pm and it was now 6:45pm so that was the reason for the wait.. Can't speak for the food because we never got to try it but as for the customer service this place is definitely sub par. They completely ruined my sister's birthday and we will not be returning based off the customer service alone. Best of luck if you decide to try this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here 3 times in a week! Very friendly, great service, amazing food, and awesome presentation! :)"}
{"text":"One of the better hibachi restaurants I've been too. The food was delicious, the staff was very friendly, and the chef was very nice and very entertaining. My only complaint was with the guy at the front. When we arrived, we were asked if we had reservations. We did not, and this seemed like an inconvenience (I've never had an issue with this before anywhere else). Then, while the chef was cooking, I noticed him having a serious conversation with someone on staff. I could have been mistaken, but it was rather obvious he had an issue with people in our party asking for double yum yum sauce. I think he was about to scold our chef, while he was cooking, until that staff member stopped him. However, I won't let that deter me from visiting again. Again, food was really good, and the rest of the staff was great."}
{"text":"How long has this been here and no one told me? A lot of the reviews on this page seem suspicious to me, but I actually mostly agree with the consensus. Good food, fair prices, cute atmosphere (if not a tiny bit gauche and ultra-lounge-ish). We ate the hibachi but didn't sit at the performance table, we sat in the bar area. The waitress and owner were very pleasant, and the serving sizes were huge (reminds me of Nagoya in Port Clinton. Food offering and prices almost identical), and it's one of the only affordable hibachi establishments in greater CLE. I highly recommend for anyone who appreciates hibachi."}
{"text":"My go to place in Medina for sushi. The staff is always extremely friendly, not over priced, sushi is always fresh & their spicy mayo is delish! (I always order a container of it) Defiantly the go to spot if you're craving some sush'"}
{"text":"Sushi on par or better than the other sushi establishments in town. However, their prices are way better and they have a great hibachi.

Also like the menu items, have had their seagood udon noodles several times, and again much better than other premium Asian eateries in the area at much better prices.

Finally the service is very good. Have always had nice servers and host staff to greet us.

If you are looking for a nice nice iuy or just casual dining this fits the bill at a range of prices."}
{"text":"We love having a hibachi in Medina!  It is definitely far from the best we have been too (the portions are very, very small for the price). Every other hibachi we've ever been too, we have left overs for a while (at the same cost!). They are very friendly, our kids love coming here, and it's in town, so we don't have to drive far. 
There restaurant is very clean, depending on who you get as your chef, can really make your experience that much better."}
