{"text":"Porter was good. Hostess was rude and wouldn't seat me by tbe window because I was by myself. Other people that were alone were seated near the window. My server was nice.  Pretzel tasted like it was a frozen pretzel that u could pick up at a local grocery store but the cheese dip was okay."}
{"text":"Service is terrible!!!! Every employee talking each other,  zero service for customers  horrible experience.   Never ask me if I want to eat !!!!!! They should close!!!! they charge me for a tall beer when I ask for a small. Be carful people check your bill. Any way I went to Paninis to eat"}
{"text":"Bar staff did not know pricing on the draft beer. Only 8 selections on draft. No prices, yeah it's an airport and I don't have choices but more than 6.00 dollar frozen French fries and and unknown prices on beer."}
{"text":"Just tried to eat breakfast here. Horrible. Ate the eggs. The rest went in the trash where it belonged. The French toast must have been of the frozen variety. The bacon was cold like it sat somewhere prior to being served. I've got sick from this kind of thing before. I passed. The potatos were French fries. Over salted. You are better off going without."}
{"text":"Terrible breakfast this morning, unidentified ingredient in breakfast burritto, unable to eat.  And manager still charged  stick to the beer!"}
{"text":"I had the bratwurst & pirogies and thought they tasted great. A tall Elliot Ness beer completed the meal. Good service too!"}
{"text":"Lots if workers, no service.  I sat at the bar for over 10 minutes and nobody even acknowledged that I was here.  There were plenty of workers coming and going from the kitchen but carrying no food or drinks.  When the bartender finally emerged from the kitchen, she first had to stop and tell a story to the servers...more time...then she got behind the bar and  started to check with the already served customers first, rather than talking to the now 4 new customers at the bar.  I was finally approached and asked what I wanted \"Burning River please\"' tall or short, \"tall please\".  When served, there was 2 inches of foam and it was warm.  This was a total disappointment.  I love Great Lakes.  I have shirts, glasses, and probably have 6-10 Great Lakes a week.  If the Conways care about their brand, they should get over here and straighten things out."}
{"text":"We had 20 min to spend and I was surprised by the good food and great drink (bloody mary was excellent). We had a Cesar chicken wrap with french fries and the service was very friendly. Highly recommend to sit down and relax or grab a bite to eat."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant / bar these guys do a good job.  The beer ... well there are few better in the States.  The specials are a solid and the calamari is great!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 1 star is for the beer. As we sat and waited for our food we witnessed three different servers take shots of alcohol while still on the clock. After our food arrived we watched two different servers walk out of the kitchen eating finger food, and then serving other tabels without washing their hands. The food was mediocre at best, and the service fell far below that. I would strongly suggest a different place to pass time while in this airport."}
{"text":"I would give this place a much higher rating, however the bar staff takes forever (greater than 10 minutes) to acknowledge customers.  Notably, Sherry (sp?) routinely ignores customers.  Pros:  1. Great Lakes beer is awesome 2. The food is better than most airport bars  Cons:  1. Service is terrible (see above) 2. Limited healthy food options"}
{"text":"If your stuck at the airport this is not a bad place to squat.  Good variety of beers and decent bar style food."}
{"text":"Double ipa is great. Nice place to kill time when connecting.  Brat and piergie complement beer. Nice load up before west coast flight"}
{"text":"Though the food is decent and Great Lakes brews amazing beers, the real gem of this place is not the bar but the brewery tour. They walk you through the entire process, answer all your questions, and you get to sample at the end! The tour guides are a wealth of knowledge.   Though the restaurant has a very fun atmosphere, the food is unremarkable and service suffers as the crowds increase. I recommend bringing a growler to fill and taking the party elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Cleveland and decided to check it out.   They have 6 or 7 beers on tap. I decided to get the Fitzgerald Porter because it had a relatively high rating on Beeradvocate. It was a decent porter but nothing mind blowing.   The service isn't very friendly but the staff is fairly attentive and speedy.   A regular beer i.e. not one of their special seasonal brews will run you a little over 6 dollars. With tip, you are looking at 7 dollars for a beer.   It's a huge upgrade from a regular airport bar but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Cleveland, so had to research my options in terms of foodage/drinkage. To my delight, a brewing company!!!   The beers are pretty good, and they've got a variety of ales for any taste. Best craft beer ever? Wouldn't go that far, but it definitely beats paying $6/$7 for the gold-colored water coming out of that \"insert generic beer name here\" tap handle.  Food wise: get the Old World Burger.  \"Straight from their website: Smoked cheddar, bacon, fried onion straws, housemade Edmund Fitzgerald Porter barbecue sauce, pretzel roll.\" To me, that just sounded too delicious to pass up and I'm glad I didn't.  I'm a sucker for pretzel rolls and this didn't disappoint--and the onion straws were fantastic on the burger.  Now, had this been a stand-alone restaurant, I think this would be a solid four-star joint.  However, it's in an airport where, let's face it, the options often suck. So, five stars it is, because this is as good as it gets for airport dining and drinking."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time about a week ago. We weren't sure what to expect in terms of portions, and way over ordered.  The tater tots were the biggest I've ever seen, and the side of pierogis could have been a whole meal. Although we enjoyed the meal, it all seemed a little over salty.  My husband ordered the fried fish and said it wasn't great. We left super stuffed though!"}
{"text":"I don't ever write reviews but I have to leave a warning here for anyone considering ordering ramen from this place. I hate to leave 2 stars because this is a cute place in a cute area, and I'm sure it has good qualities. Everyone I was with said their food was good... except of course the other person who ordered the \"ramen\". First thing I noticed right off the bat when they brought our food out was that the ramen was legit served on a plate. The edges were slightly raised but it was a plate. There was essentially zero broth (which was the reason I ordered it in the first place cus I'm fighting a cold). I don't think I could have gathered a full 2 spoonfuls of broth if I tried. The noodles were complete mush and accompanied by a pile of soggy squash and zucchini. It was seriously horrendous. I force fed myself a handful of bites only because my Dad was treating us and my dish was $14! Not exactly cheap for a plate of garbage. Also, unfortunately, our waitress was pretty terrible. She was not listening to a word we said and was very short and abrupt with us. At one point she started grabbing my Mom's plate, my mom said she wasn't finished, she replied \"okay\", and then bolted away with the plate. Anyway, please... Great Lakes Brewing Co., take this ramen off of your menu. ASAP. It has no place in your restaurant."}
{"text":"Good bar food.  Can't go wrong with the burger, fries and Dortmunder Gold!"}
{"text":"Nice place to have a sit-down meal on the way to my United gate further down C corridor. Service was friendly. We were able to order and finish our food within an hour, even though it was a bit rushed. Took about 10-15 mins for a burger and fish sandwich to come out. The Texas toast with the fish was amazing but wish I could say the same for the cole slaw (very lackluster). Fish was delightfully flakey and breading was nice and crunchy. Couldn't pick up the sandwich to eat though since the sauce from the cole slaw left the bottom toasts soggy. Not the cheapest meal (around $15-$20 for most entrees) but it's a solid option if you don't want to pick up something quick at the food court area."}
{"text":"Considering the fact that it's inside of a terminal, the food is okay. I docked a couple stars mainly because our of our waitress. my group was already in a not so great mood because we had a hard time checking our bags in with the idiots at United Airlines. Then had to deal with the rude meat head TSAs.   Our waitress, Melissa, was impatient from the moment we walked in.  We only asked a couple questions regarding the sizes of the beers we ordered. I WAS ONLY CURIOUS! I didn't know it was such rocket science to show us the sizes of the beers.   Our food finally came out. As she was walking away to get us some plates, i quickly tried to get her attention to ask for some hot sauce. I thought she didn't hear me since she didn't turn around when I asked her.  She brought over a couple of plates for us and the top plate was dirty. She quickly tried to get the piece of old food off the plate while I wasn't looking. When she realized I saw her hide the piece of crumb, she quickly made a comment about how it had a small crumb and tried to brush it off.   She didn't stop by once to see if we needed anything or asked how our food was. Overall,  our waitress was a b*tch and made me even happier to be leaving Ohio.  Peace out you boring ass state."}
{"text":"If I can make it at home and would be happy/proud of the dish I give it 3 stars. Great food I can't make gets 4 stars. 5 stars is for food-gasm experiences you have less than  you can count on your fingers and toes in your life time. Great Lakes at the airport has great fast airport service but kitchen is awful. I thought no it is so focused on speed that it's product really suffers.  Cafeteria at hospital I work in produces a better product from their hot bar day in day out than the pretzel chicken I got today here at Great Lakes Brewery airport location. Chicken and veggies were way under salted and seasoned. Mash potatoes were well salted but watery consistency. Dish needed a sauce. Surprised at how bad it was as Great Lakes kitchen at location (s) in Cleveland are at least a 3 star location to me. Airport location gets 2 stars because I feel they were trying and were efficient but had a bad food product. 1 star for me is if you don't try and have a bad product. Amazon by how long reviews get when you're stuck at airport cuz Delta is delayed again. Can I review delta on yelp too? Lol"}
{"text":"Went here since I had time to kill. To start- the service was bad. Unknown to my group, We sat down in a closed section - there was no sign and no one approached us. Once we went looking for a server -we were then informed we needed to move. Upon moving- it took the server several minutes to acknowledge us-no apology , no smile -server seemed a bit short ( almost rude )with us. I went to order the soup from their menu (cheese soup) and was then informed that it wasn't offered that day- even though it was on the menu- no indication anywhere that there were daily soups. The final straw was the food stuck to the water glass. We promptly walked out. Poor service , poor communication , and dirty glasses - talk about 3 strikes ."}
{"text":"Nice to grab a Great Lakes beer before a long flight. I haven't had the food much at this location, but the beers are always good and the waitresses have always been quick and nice even when just grabbing a drink but no food."}
{"text":"If I could rate this a zero I would. Food was fine... Beer was fine. Service was awful. Brian, was my server. I ordered a Rally Drum beer on draft and gumbo. As soon as he dropped off my beer we walks away and comes back five minutes later and says \"can I get you another one of those\"... \"Another one of what?\" I ask... Mind you I had barely gotten to my beer or my gumbo. He said, \"The beer!  Or maybe a round of shots?\". I said no... First time I thought that he may just be giving me a hard time. I can take a joke. However he kept coming around and asking me every five minutes about getting me another beer or a shot. Answer was still no. After the 4th time of him asking I had it. I asked for the bill and he sounded offended. I asked for the check. After giving me the check... AGAIN... He asks if I want a round of shots because he can easily add it to the bill. Again I say no. As you can imagine I will not be back here anytime soon.   I am a traveling professional and I have no idea why Brian felt the need to harass me. So unprofessional of him and very out of line."}
{"text":"Everything was delivious, service was fast and very knowledgeable about the food. Very nice as well! Atmosphere is like an old pub style. We went on the brewery tour right before which I also recommend!   Meal of Choice: Pretzel chicken dipped in mustard ale. To die for!"}
{"text":"One of the best beers in Cleveland. Food amazing, Pricey."}
{"text":"I stop here for the beer never to eat the menu is nothing special and what I saw coming out of the kitchen I just don't see myself ordering food in the future, The three stars are for the beer selection it's really something special the service was also pretty good no complaints. This bar always seems to be the place to be in Terminal \"C\". I would recommend trying it if you like beer they also serve alcohol but eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ended up coming here for breakfast as aircanadas flight got canceled on me and the next one was delayed for hours so they gave a ten dollar voucher. I had the pancake and egg breakfast. I just wanted the pancakes but they wouldn't allow that so I had to get everything else. After being in transit for 24 hours due to weather issues and being stressed I wasn't exactly hungry and didn't finish it all. It was a lot of food but also the bacon was just the microwave kind and the potato were also ones from a bag. Expensive for something that probably cost 5 dollars to make. The coffee was questionable as well the pancakes were pretty good but you also can't really screw those up."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service for an airport eatery. I got the Old World Burger and it was simply amazing. A perfect portion accompanied with fries. The burger was delicious and juicy. I also added the 5 beer flight (only $10) and was far from disappointed. All of the beer was delicious. My waiter Brian was very attentive, even though he had several tables. He was knowledgeable on the food and beer. All and all the damage was under $30, which is rare for a meal and drinks in an airport!"}
{"text":"The beer tap was literally crawling with flies and gnats. Bartenders were nice enough but it was disgusting. I had to kill 4 or 5 in the span of time it took me to have 1 drink (not a beer, thankfully). Go anywhere else. Yuck."}
{"text":"We stopped in and had a flight of beers and a sausage plate ....which were both wonderful. The flight was a great way to try something new and the sausage plate was cooked perfectly and delicious... A must try!"}
{"text":"Had a really great beer and a very yummy hamburger. Enjoyed this place, if you have a layover make a stop and grab a beer."}
{"text":"Why 3 stars? Because it's a decent place to kill time at the airport.     ---   ---   ---  I used to live in Cleveland, and I'm not sure if GLBC was around back in 2005-6, but I was not the craft beer fan at that time, that I've evolved into today. Since moving away, I have heard never-ending discussion about the Great Lakes Christmas Ale, as if it's nectar produced by God, that gives off super powers when consumed. So needless to say, I was anxious to gain invisibility.  It turned out, however, that I didn't really buy into all the hype. It was a decent beer, but nothing I'd go out of my way to order again. And that's not an opinion that's too dissimilar on my thoughts of any of GLBC beer I've tried. I've hung at this airport brewery a couple of times, tried a few different beers, and wouldn't really rate any of the beers higher than a 3/5. On one of my visits, the bar tender could not have seemed to possibly be enjoying her job any less.   So, \"meh,\" it is."}
{"text":"This review is for the tour that I went on at GLB. A group of us from work gathered at GLB's beer symposium, which is really a cool little museum for GLB that has a bar in it. Yes, a bar. We were given four tokens/tickets each that were good for a drink per token. After we all got our beer, we were shown a short video about GLB and then our tour directors (both named Sarah, so that was fun having the \"is the 'h' really necessary debate\") took us across the street to where all the glorious beer was made/bottled. After our tour, we went back to the symposium/bar and had the chance to use up the rest of our tokens. If you get a chance to take the tour, I highly recommend!! :)"}
{"text":"Beers are good but don't bother for food especially not for breakfast. Also, whether you're there for food just drinks, make sure you have enough time... Service is friendly but extremely slow!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a zero if I could, sign said self seating looked at staff and sat down, waited 25mins then the waitress came over and said oh im sorry i didnt see you there. Was told we only serve appetizers as we close in an hour, I was keen to try the chicken pretzel main. This place wasn't even busy. Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"If you're in terminal C this is your spot! Awesome brews you can bring with you on your flight. Good food and great service. You might never know you are in an airport!"}
{"text":"Great beer. Actually fantastic beer if you're in the Cleveland area. Get the Pub Burger with the salad. The pretzels roll is amazing. Come here every time I fly through practically."}
{"text":"I seated myself because the sign told me to.  I was sitting long enough to look over the menu and decide what I wanted.  A waitress came over to the table next to me with his order and then walked away and went to the back.  She came back and stopped at the table in front of me and told them their margarita would be ready in a minute and then immediately walked to the bar to get it and then brought it to them and then walked away... So I left.  If that's how long I have to wait to even be greeted, I wasn't sure if I'd be done in an hour to catch my flight (I had 1.5 hrs until departure)"}
{"text":"I blame it mostly on this being an airport location. So I am being kind. The beer is good. And I appreciate that they do serve samplers even at an airport location. But the food left something to be desired.  I ordered the boneless wings (only wing option on the menu). You could choose from mild, hot, chipolte, or BBQ. Of course, I went with the hot. And, of course, they weren't actually hot. The breading was poor and the chicken itself was just ok. I could barely eat half of the order. And despite ordering both blue cheese and ranch, I only got a side of one. The problem is, I couldn't tell which one. It was almost as if they mixed the two together - and it didn't work.  But the beer was good. And it was nice to have good beer directly next to my gate. So I can't really complain. But I am sincerely hoping that the actual Cleveland location of Great Lakes has better food than this crummy airport location. And I'm also sincerely hoping that the service is better at the actual Cleveland location."}
{"text":"Really great place!  Don't usually find good food in an airport, so this was a pleasant surprise.  Very attentive wait staff and great selection of beers.  The pizza was great.  If you are in the Cleveland airport you should eat here for sure."}
{"text":"Worst meal I've had in a long while. Got an $11 omelette for breakfast. Barely edible. Mostly onion. An absurd amount of onion wrapped in a little rubbery egg. The potatoes are like fry crumbs. Service was also horrible. Crap even for airport food."}
{"text":"I never expect too much from airport fare during layovers. I go into it knowing that the food is not going to be extraordinary, it's going to be over-priced, and you are lucky to get service with a smile. If you go into an airport restaurant expecting too much you are likely to be disappointed.  We had a layover in Cleveland and my boyfriend, who is from east Pennsylvania saw the Great Lakes Brewery sign and knew that it was the time of year for Christmas Ale. It was my first time trying this brew and I absolutely loved it. It had so much flavor and tasted like it came from a fresh keg. That part was awesome.  We then decided to split an appetizer. It was the spinach artichoke dip served with some veggies and crackers. The first couple bites were pretty good and then all the sudden it was not good anymore. Something tasted rotten and I have no idea how i didn't notice it in the first couple bites. Needless to say, I stopped eating it right away before I felt any worse. I had a tummy ache for a couple hours after. Booo!  The service was not bad at all considering. The bartender was sweet, helpful, and quick. I think this is one of the better places to stop in this terminal."}
{"text":"This place has potential but falls short of greatness.   The signature cocktail menu is lopsided towards vodka or ginger beer drinks. Not bad recipes but not much variety.   The sausage sampler has good taste and VERY substantial proportion. Unfortunately all 4 are a bit dry, as is the slightly too-sweet cabbage.   The service is friendly and attentive. Unfortunately my server had a really hard time remembering the -- steady now -- four gins they have.   Prices are reasonable for an airport."}
{"text":"Didn't order food but the flight of beers by Great Lakes brewing companies are amazing!"}
{"text":"With 3 hours to kill in what I heard was a very boring airport, I was afraid. But after a brief stroll down the Continental concourse, there was Great Lakes shining in all its glory. Apparently they had just opened this location, so we came at the right time. And then it was time to drink, and drink.  The Beer: It was good - but of course it is - it's the best brewery in Ohio. I had the Irish Ale, and the Pale Ale. Pale Ale was good, but not any better than at other micros. The Irish Ale was real good - and not something I've seen at other micros before.  The food: We weren't eating much, but the fries we were munching on were pretty good. Other people's food looked good at least.   The location: Midway through the Continental Concourse it's a bit of a hike if like us you're coming from Southwest, but on the plus there's some nice big windows that both enable plane watching and give the restaurant the natural light that other restaurants we passed by lacked.   The verdict: The best place to go if you have time to kill at Hopkins. Or maybe you should even arrive early just to make a stop here - judging by the reviews of the main location (which I haven't been to) this may very well be a nicer restaurant experience than the main brewpub."}
{"text":"One of the best two burgers I've had in months. Simple but down perfectly. Medium rare exactly as it should be, bun soft on the outside and crispy on the inside. I was told their salad was excellent.  Friendly staff, fast service, and lots of beer on tap.  They were out of the beer I wanted to take with me, but a great experience overall."}
{"text":"Good place to sit down and grab a burger before your flight.  Food here is a little healthier than grabbing fast food."}
{"text":"I was stuck in the Cleveland airport for many hours after I missed my connection and was definitely in search of some good beer. I went in here, sat down (sign said \"seat yourself\") and had no service. For fifteen minutes. Then, I left because I literally couldn't see a server anywhere. I came back an hour later and this time, once I sat myself, the service was immediate and very good.   The beers were awesome. I started with the Alberta Clipper porter, which was amazing. I loved it. I also ordered the pretzels, which were just not good. They tasted like something I might take from my freezer. The mustard they were served with was also pretty gross. Next, I got the Dortmunder gold and a side of onion rings (healthy meal haha). The Dortmunder gold was great and the onion rings were quite seriously THE BEST ONION RINGS I HAVE EVER HAD. Oh my GOODNESS. I don't know what they put on them. There's some kind of spice. They were seriously incredible. Must-get if you're in CLE for a few hours."}
{"text":"Good place to stop in for a burger and a beer if you are passing through Cleveland's airport.    the beers themselves are quite good, and the burger I ordered was good for terminal food...  All in all, it was A-OK..."}
{"text":"If you ever find yourself with time to kill at CLE, make a beeline to GLBC! Lots of taps of the flagship beers as well as some seasonal offerings might put you in danger of missing your flight."}
{"text":"The bartender was EXTREMELY rude, she pressured us to order & when we didn't order quickly enough she rudely said only paying customers could sit at the bar. This immediately put a bad taste in our mouth and we took our business elsewhere. There was an underlying sense of not feeling \"welcome\" in that establishment by her from the beginning if you know what I mean. Never again & it took us so long because the menu was limited!"}
{"text":"Go for the beer, only. I had this chicken sandwich that I'm still bummed about. The pretzel bun wasn't toasted or buttered or anything - you could tell they just pulled it out of the bag. And the chicken was really tough and stringy. I'm not sure if that means overcooked or frozen too many times but it was kinda gross. Also, I paid extra for a side salad and these little gnat things wouldn't leave it alone and started crawling around inside it while I ate my sandwich. I didn't eat it. I know it's not like the kitchen put them there, but I felt like a clean restaurant could've been a factor."}
{"text":"On my way back to Houston, Tx, I laid over at Cleveland, OH. I looked at this place in Concourse C from the outside and thought, \"Why not??? Let's give it a try.\" It was an average experience.  I had the Amber Lager and Creole Gumbo. Lager = good, Gumbo= no go. I was disappointed in the food, but the beerwas good. Not a total loss. I recommend this to business traveler, traveling on a company expense account with time to kill."}
{"text":"Service was better than I could have asked for in an airport. Got a beer and read my book for a while, then ordered food. Wasn't sure if she would mind that I took a booth up for a few hours. Ordered the turkey club, based on a recommendation from the waitress and it was a really good sandwich. Really filling. Could hardly eat my sweet potato fries. They were really good with the spicy ketchup they have there. The other restaurants in that airport have horrendous reviews so if I'm ever back in Cleveland, I will come to this one again."}
{"text":"Ok, since I've been east over the past 4 years I've noticed something... most y'all reviewers on here are WAY stingy with the stars. Back west I only went to 4-4.5 star spots, rightfully so IMO being a \"True Yelper\", but here? 3.5 is a decent spot in many instances. Folks come on, you get to drink beer from an amazing brewery in the damn airport while you wait for United to make up for all the lost hours they took from your life by supplanting it with fermented ales, lagers, IPAs... be humble, drink your amazing beer, get in line, try not to moo, and sit in your seat. Enjoy the buzz. Check your social. Think about getting one or two of those little bottles... you get it. Bye, Felicia."}
{"text":"This place is the reason I am never late for my flight  I always arrive at the airport early so I could stop by here (even though it's so damn far away from my gate), enjoy a tall glass of Dortmunder and maybe something to eat before flying back to LGA. It puts me in a happy place   Servers/bartenders here are all very nice and helping.   Only thing is food is really mediocre. I've gotten the pierogi and brats as well as the old world burger. Pierogi and brats were very very bland. The old world burger was just too saucy, and the bread to dense. Whatever. You don't come here for a 5 star meal, it's an airport. You come here to have a great glass of beer and you can't go wrong with Great Lakes  Food: B Atmosphere: B+ Service: B-"}
{"text":"If you want an omelet, the actual omelet is great. The hashbrowns are the worst excuse for a potato I've ever seen. It was like what you find at the bottom of your deep fryer at the end of a busy Saturday night. Beer is great, bartender a little cray but great. I suggest coming here. But not for the food."}
{"text":"This is the Great Lakes Brewing location at Cleveland Hopkins Airport Concourse C. For airport food, GLB does a decent job and is better than a lot of the options in the CLE Airport. I sat at the bar and found the service to be just adequate, but the food and beer were good, relatively speaking. GLB beer will not measure up to the great breweries in Portland, Oregon, but they deliver some of the best local beer in Cleveland. Foodwise, I had the hamburger and it was pretty good, though small in size. I ended up having a second one to make sure I was full for my flight. If you are in CLE and have a lengthy layover, check out Great Lakes Brewing in Concourse C."}
{"text":"At CLE.  Need food. Need beverage.  This place will do.  Unimaginative cuisine served without drama."}
{"text":"Geez, how long does it take for a bowl of soup? Well I it arrived and was very good. I got the cheese soup. My Cesar salad with grilled chicken is another story. She brought me the salad with blackened  shrimp. When I brought it to her attention. I was told I said shrimp but pointed to chicken. She said she was wondering about that. She asked if I was allergic or anything. Nope I'll take it. Funny thing is she asked the guy next to me if he was in any major hurry. Nope, ok well yours will be alittle longer, \"paper ran out of printer\" in the kitchen so he didn't get your order...hmmmmmm."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that there's Great Lakes at Cleveland Hopkins. This will likely give you the best possible food you could find in the entire airport. I had excellent Bratwurst paired with the Gold lager. I would not recommend this if you were in a hurry though, the food takes time."}
{"text":"Good selection of beers and good service!"}
{"text":"Let's get real... Cleveland isn't the best city (nor is their airport).  Asshole comments aside, I wish I knew about this place earlier. They have six different Great Lakes beers on tap with a seasonal rotation. Although they are \"competitively priced\" in the airport at $8/pint, it's worth it. Especially the Christmas Ale."}
{"text":"Was passing through Cleveland and had some extra time before my flight. Grabbed a seat at the bar, and was promptly greeted by Clara, the bartender.  Had my beer in a flash, and Clara made some suggestions from the menu. I don't frequently visit bars when I travel, especially airport bars, though this time I was glad I did. Clara is a great bartender. She greats you with a smile, and is attentive  to the entire bar while making sure you have whatever you need.  Food was served promptly, and when I asked for some sauce in the side it was no problem.  Friendly, enthusiastic and professional - sit at the bar if Clara's working - she's the real deal.  If it were my company, I would make her a trainer because she understands hospitality and customer service.  She's a great ambassador for Great Lakes, and I would make it a point to stop by any time I am passing through Cleveland Hopkins."}
{"text":"As far as airport resto-bars are concerned, this place isn't so bad. My crew and I spent a little more then an hour here waiting on our flight.   All I had was the pretzels, but I must say....they hit the spot. Beers are very good...all sorts ....."}
{"text":"Five stars, because the beer is really good and I quite enjoyed the burger I ordered (old world burger in a pretzel bun) as well. For an airport pub/restaurant this is definitely way above average! Prices a bit upmarket, but hey - it's an airport place. Those are never cheap.   Should you end up in Cleveland airport, I can definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Was stuck with a 3 hour layover and found this little gem thanks to YELP.  Not to sure how the food here is but I can tell you there is enough beer to keep a guy busy and happy for 3 hours.  Service was smooth"}
{"text":"Only been to the one at Hopkins, of course the beer is great (it's great lakes).  appetizers are a welcome alternative to the food court and I am sure the rest of the menu is good, just have never had time to try it as I fly out of a different terminal."}
{"text":"For an airport bar it's definitely ok. Just come here for the beer and not the service. I don't fully blame the bartenders for their attitudes though because airport customers can be rediculous. Food is decent but the beer is excellent."}
{"text":"The beer gets five stars (I highly recommend the Edmund Fitzgerald Porter) and the food gets one measly little star. Food is disappointing and painfully overpriced -- and my expectations were ultra low to begin with (it's in an airport after all). Regretfully, ordering their fish and chips was a spendy mistake. Also, the servers seem to have developed perma-scowl. Surely, working in an airport sucks -- and they have it written all over their ornery faces. Good news is that the beer is strong and tasty! Do yourself a favor -- enjoy a pint or two and skip the food."}
{"text":"Although  I haven't  been here recently,  it is one of my family's  favorite places to eat and enjoy  the fabulous  beer. The staff and service is great just like there name. They work to accommodate people  in wheelchairs  like my son.  I really  can' t say enough about Great Lakes.  Their food is very good."}
{"text":"The beer prices are stupid high here, i get it is an airport but somebody needs to address this, it is highway robbery!! My 12oz beer was worth no more than $5.50 i'll even say $6 but $9 is crazy!!!"}
{"text":"well, contrary to my review of cleveland airport, i guess i did notice the food choices because i stopped in the Great Lakes Brewing company while waiting for a flight.   unknowingly, i ordered the most potent of their brews. very hoppy for my palate, but after half the glass (a very large glass) i was feeling buzzed. the server asked several times if i needed anything, but i didn't feel pressured at all to hurry up and drink my beverage or order something else.   my beer came to about 7 bucks, more than i normally pay for even a six-pack, but the beer was tasty and it was in the airport. which always makes me feel fancy when i drink alcohol in the airport."}
{"text":"Most layovers are boring.  You wander the concourse, look at the overpriced bottled water and tabloid rags at the newsstand.  Do a little people-watching at the gate.  And if you get hungry, you spend way too much on whatever crummy chain fast-food they've got at the food court (because it's not like they'll really feed you on the plane).  Great Lakes is a pleasant change from this - it's a decent local brewery-restaurant in Terminal C where you can kill time and snag some good food and drinks.  They've got a good selection of their beers on tap - the seasonals rotate, but there's plenty of variety from IPA to porter.  They do beer flights, so you can sample 3-4 different beers.  I chose a flight of three and tried the Eliot Ness, the Christmas Ale, and the Edmund Fitzgerald.  All solid brews, especially the Christmas Ale.  I'm curious to try more of their beers, but I don't end up in Cleveland enough.  (Huh, never thought I'd feel that way!)  The food is solid, definitely above most airport grub.  The Stilton soup is good, maybe a little too salty and thick for my tastes.  But it's cheese soup... can't really get more Midwestern than that!  My pierogies were good, served with plenty of sour cream, but the red cabbage and bratwurst on the same platter were overcooked and under-seasoned.  I was rather full after all of that, but I had to try the deep-fried Mars bar - and it was worth it.    I would've leaned towards 3-3.5 stars if this were outside of an airport.  But they get some extra credit for making 2.5 hours in Cleveland a pleasant experience.  That's hard to do!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat while waiting for boarding. Definitely worth stopping by to grab a seat and dine. Been here for breakfast and lunch. Both experienced really satisfying with nice service. Clean environment too"}
{"text":"I ALWAYS love this place! Waiting till Summer so I can sit on the patio and drink a Dortmunder and have a big fat cheeseburger!!!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to get a sandwhich or a beer to be honest. Service was super quiet but really quick. The bartender was great and the food was really better than expected. Much better than 90% of the places here."}
{"text":"Great place to stop for a beer. The prices were very reasonable, and they even had beer to go. It was totally worth the walk over from Terminal B during my flight delay."}
{"text":"Okay stop at an airport. There are probably a few more enjoyable places around. I've only stopped once but the service was less than desirable for someone who just wanted an easy stop before flying out. Food portions are large for an airport which might work for others but mine just went to waste."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED  I normally hate airport food, but this was an exception for sure!   Food: Hubby and I split shrimp and grits and it was absolutely excellent! Good portion, 5 lg shrimp with andouille sausage and peppers. $18  Drinks: short beer - what you'd expect from Great Lakes Elliot Ness. I had a Moscow Mule replacing the vodka with gin - woo!! You get a very good drink, good amount of gin."}
{"text":"I can't even review the food. Do you know why I can't even review the food? Because I didn't eat here. And do you know why I didn't eat here? Because after I was seated, I waited a full 15 minutes, and not a single server stopped by my table. So I left.  I should have had the warning sign when I stopped in front of the restaurant and there was no host. And I waited. It was only about two minutes, but that's still annoying to wait without a host just to be seated. She gave me a seat in a corner. There were people eating at the tables at either side of me.  Now, I don't know about you, but if you have someone who has literally walked into a place with the purpose of spending money, you might want to take a moment to do something so that he actually spends that money. Like, take his order. But silly me, I guess that's not how they roll at GLBC.  I browsed the menu and looked at a nice little Prix Fixe menu of four courses for $17 that they guaranteed in 20 minutes or less. It's an airport, after all; people have to make connections, so they place a premium on service.  It looked good to me. I closed my menu, I got out my phone, I sent a couple of emails, I checked in on Yelp. I looked at some sports scores. I noticed out of the corner of my eye the tables beside me getting bussed. I looked up and watched the game on the TV for a bit. I checked my watch. 10 minutes had passed.  And I waited. And waited. Annoyed at this point. And not really in the mood of walking across the room (because I hadn't seen a server in my section in some time now) and finding someone and demanding service, I waited. And as the 15 minute mark hit, I stood up and walked out.  On the way out, the host looked at me with some concern. And she asked, with obvious exhaustion, \"No one came to take your order?\" No, no one did. And by the tone of your voice, it sounds like this isn't the first time that's happened, either.  How terrible must it be? How bad of service must it be to be unaware of someone in your section? Or, how bad must be it to know someone's there an ignore them? Lose lose.  I went around the corner and grabbed a sandwich somewhere else because, as I mentioned above, I had a flight to catch. I won't even try to visit this place on my future trips through CLE."}
{"text":"Pros: The beers were delicious. One can never go wrong with Great Lakes beer, especially straight from tap.  The food here is slightly over priced, but is expected from an airport restaurant. I do have to say that the basket of fries came in an enormous portion that one person cannot finish by themselves. It was perfectly cooked, crispy and fresh. (Who review's fries? I had to mention it because it was indeed satisfying with my beer.)  Cons: The service was subpar. I sat on the bar. The female bartender seemed like I was just an inconvenience, and I had to flag her down whenever I needed something instead of simply asking if everything was okay. I got a cold vibe from her every time I asked a question, like I walked into her house and disrespected her in some way. She kept hanging out near the kitchen entrance chatting and joking happily with her co-workers every time she finished serving someone, but didn't even try to make eye contact when talking to me, like she was too busy to help.   Conclusion: If the service wasn't so dull and cold, I would have given it 4-stars for the delicious beer."}
{"text":"Bad food, great beer.  Luckily it's possible for one to survive on beer alone long enough to make your connection.   This might be the beer talking, but I probably gave an extra star because they had a lot of TVs with more than just the regular broadcast NFL games ... you could do worse for an airport bar."}
{"text":"So I am a fan of their flagship location in Ohio City. Usually airport renderings of restaurants are sub standard because they have a captive audience. This is simply the best dining experience in an airport that I have ever had. It does not have the ambience of he original, but it has the food and most of the beers at reasonable prices. Service was friendly and attentive. Great experience."}
{"text":"Walked in at 5:05 PM on Saturday and told they close at 5:00. Really???  We were told at Panini's that they are not supposed to close. The staff at Panini's was a delight!"}
{"text":"With my travel companion he wanted to grab a bite to eat.. He feeling like a salad considering all the shit food we've been eating the last two days as if that's going to wash it away. Lol. He convinced me to have the chicken garden salad with a strawberry vinaigrette. I be damn that salad was amazing!!! Of course we wash it down with a dark stout beer. Such a surprise for a place that you would think having typical bar food."}
{"text":"Nice oasis in the airport.  Lots of tvs to enjoy the news or a game.  I'd like to try the blueberry mule sometime.  The restaurant is located near gate C14.  I enjoyed the grilled salad - blackened grilled shrimp, strawberries, almonds, cranberries and balsamic vinaigrette.  The shrimp was good, large size.  The other elements of the salad were average.  The strawberries were cut up so small that probably only two strawberries the entire dish.  It was affordable, 15$ and the shrimp were almost prawn size.  If you have a long layover or are here early for a flight, this is a good place to escape the typical airport ambience."}
{"text":"Wonderful, warm environment. The sampler appetizer was great and paired well with their black out stout. Service was decent, although the server sounded annoyed anytime we asked for anything."}
{"text":"My flight was delayed and I was hungry so I stopped in here and decided I wanted a turkey club..I have to tell you the club sling with the great service was excellent!!   It is the shirata mayo sauce and avocado that made this sands Which! Highly recommend it and the service was excellent!!,"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. This is my favorite restaurant in the CLE airport. It is comfortable, not just wooden chairs and flimsy tables, this is a legit bar/restaurant with a full menu.  The selection of beer is nice, light to dark for all palettes.  When I have had to fly into or through CLE, I always stop here. The food is very good and the portions are large enough to share. The burgers have always been prepared \"medium\" as I requested. 2 out of 2 is good for me. The fact they have a burger on a pretzel bun, a GOOD pretzel bun would have me coming back. The pretzel bun they use is a little sweet and it is moist and fresh.  The caesar salad was cool, crisp and fresh and if you like cheese...you will LOVE theirs.  The service is fast, so if you are connecting and have at least an hour, don't worry, they will get you through without you feeling like you are being rushed or late. I never found myself craning my neck looking for the server, they are active and visible and again, very friendly!"}
{"text":"Edmond Fitzgerald porter is just yummy. The sausage appetizer is a meal for anyone and not to be missed for only $10. Service fast and friendly."}
{"text":"My most recent favorite beer from GLB is the Holy Moses Raspberry White Ale. A fresh summer-y ale, it is worth parting the Red Sea to get to this fruity freshness on a hot day on the North Coast."}
{"text":"I wish I was in the mood for a beer; I liked the names of their beers for sure! With that said, the wife and I stopped on a layover and the smell of delicious burgers at dinner time tempted us. I had the old world burger which was cooked correctly, served with a bit of BBQ sauce and onions on a pretzel bun and was tasty but quite dry as was the        cole slaw I had on the side. The wife had the standard pub burger which she enjoyed.   Service was adequate. I felt no reason to tip higher than 15 percent which is on the low side for me, but adequate is as accurate as I can describe."}
{"text":"Outstanding for airport food. Loved the pretzel buns and the onion rings. Split a decent ceasar salad with the husband. He ordered the old world burger and I the grilled chicken with onion rings. We were pleased. Also really friendly attentive service. Kind of pricey but it is in an airport. Not for the thrifty but a nice treat if you've been tortured by the airlines all day and haven't had a decent meal."}
{"text":"Words that do NOT come to mind when eating at an airport restaurant: Selection. Classy. Relaxing. Affordable.  Words that DO come to mind when eating at GLBC in the CLE airport: Great selection. Classy. Relaxing. Affordable - but.  If you are traveling through Cleveland via air and are not able to visit GLBC in the flesh in Ohio City - get your ass to Concourse C for an ice cold brew and burger.  Despite my growing disdain for air travel (I have my good and bad days - today just happened to be a bad), my black bean burger on a rockin' pretzel bun and my chilled Dortmunder turned my travel-frown upside-down in a minute flat."}
{"text":"My apologies to the beer aficionados out there, no beer for me during this visit.    Great Lakes Brewing is conveniently located across from gate C14 (my gate) so I could relax comfortably while waiting for my flight to start boarding.  They have a nice variety of menu options to choose from including all the burger variations one could want, salads, sandwiches and a selection of main entrees.    I opted to have the turkey club with fries to fill me up before my flight home.  It came on crispy toasted white bread, roasted turkey, sprouts, fresh avocado, fatty bacon that needed to be cooked a bit longer and a Sriracha aioli.   The fries were thick cut and could have been crispier for my taste but it didn't keep me from eating most of them.  The turkey club was large and was packed with fresh ingredients.  It needed more moisture either from the aioli or some tomato to be a perfect club but I was definitely pleased with my lunch prior to getting on the plane.    Next time I will definitely have to try some beer."}
{"text":"Best beer in Cleveland, but inconsistent quality when it comes to food.  I'm a big fan of the Great Lakes in terminal C. When I was passing through once a week, I found it difficult to go more than two weeks without stopping in. Like I said, top quality beers, plus they are good about rotating through the seasonal brews.   The food is good, but you never know what you're going to get. I've had food come out cooked  perfectly one time and way over done the next. Also seen portion sizes fluctuate quite a bit. 50% of the time everything is perfect while the other 50% it's something other than that.  If you've got time and money to spend, hop in here to get some amazing beer. If you're feeling some food, burgers are a pretty safe bet. Give yourself at least an hour before boarding though to make sure you aren't rushing through your meal."}
{"text":"I was here on a layover from mexico to newark international... and since they make you buy the food on flights these days (damn airlines) i decided to try to get a bite to eat before the connecting flight.   Unfortunately i was all alcoholled out from the partying at my friend's wedding in mexico that i did not try the beers. so this review is based just on the food that i had.   The food here is okay... I tried their famous stilton cheddar ale soup. Maybe I had too high expectations, because they did say famous, but it wasn't as good as i had hoped it to be. Especially when there was another soup on the menu which i was thinking about trying too.   I got the blue cheese burger as the main course... It was okay, not really memorable but not horrible.   In all if i were to have a layover in cleveland ever again i might try some of the other stuff on the menu.... and of course some of the BEERS!"}
{"text":"Great Lakes is a local brewery so it's nice to see them with an outlet here in the airport. They have a half-dozen or so of their own beers on tap and a number of guest beers, plus the usual airport food.  I stopped by today for a beer, and it was tasty awesome. Main problem? No power outlets to be seen. So I finished my beer and moved along."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a layover to Newark NJ ...the Maple-Mustard Glazed Salmon is a must try!!! Nice and friendly service too."}
{"text":"Excellent beers and decent food. The vibe is typical airport, tiny cramped tables. I recommend getting the beer sampler if you don't have a favorite yet. I got the brats and pierogi. Although it's a great combination, bratwurst was just not prepared that well and wasn't as tasty as others I've had."}
{"text":"Those XXL oysters are serious bang for your buck! But as far as anything else being a good bang for your buck... I can't say there are many other great deals.  Pretty scenery, knowledgeable staff-- but slow service and too pricey in my opinion."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a beer and dinner before boarding a flight back to DC. This location is on Concourse C of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.  As Great Lakes Brewing Co. makes their own beer and serves it here  -  they don't offer beers from other breweries. I have to say this because I was sitting at the bar - I  had to laugh to myself - some guy walked up and tried to order a Bud Light from the bartender. He clearly did not get it.  I ordered the Commodore Perry IPA and a bowl of their Creole Gumbo. The IPA was far more clear/uncloudy than I am accustomed to. Most IPAs have a cloudy, unfiltered appearance. This IPA was not as hoppy as I would like.  The Gumbo? I would not order it again. I should know better. Not much flavor. I added some hot sauce to make it better.  Service was good. Worth coming here for the beer. Food-wise, might be better to stick to items on the menu that are simple - burgers and such.  Service was good and bartenders were friendly.  NOTE:  Until Yelp corrects this listing, the correct address for this location is:  Great Lakes Brewing Co. Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, Concourse C 5300 Riverside Drive Cleveland, OH 44135"}
{"text":"Stuck in the airport? Got some time to kill? Wanna get drunk before that long flight?  WELL SAY HELLO TO GREAT LAKES BREWING COMPANY!!  Local brewery that has a full bar, serves food, and gets you drunk. Hell, not bad at all!  Add me to the regulars list!"}
{"text":"The employees at this location arent actual GLBC employees but they know their stuff when it comes to the best beers in Cleveland!  Great sampling of the actual restaurant menu and has the cozy cellar pub feel of the W. 25th st location.  Slainte!"}
{"text":"Travelers beware: although Great Lakes brews some good beers, stay away from this place!  - This restaurant was extremely understaffed on a Friday evening - Food was ridiculously salty and inedible - Management is terrible and unresponsive - Took almost 2 hours for a party of 6, and we almost missed our flight  Should be fine if you just want to stop by for a quick drink, but get food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Highlights/lowlights  1) decent airport food 2) convenient location in the C terminal  3) not super friendly service  Disclaimer: this review may be completely unfair because Great Lakes Brewery is known for its beer, and as a someone with celiac disease, I did not get to try any of the famous brews!  I stopped in for a really quick dinner during a 90 minute connection. I sat at the bar and had no problem getting a seat (I was there around 5:45pm). The server brought me silverware and took my drink order right away. I'm not sure if a lot of the staff was new or just stressed out during dinner time but nobody was particularly friendly and the servers seemed to be snapping at each other (awkward!). I waited about 15-20 minutes for my food which is a little longer than I would expect at an airport but the grilled fish tacos were totally worth it! The citrus slaw and spicy salsa was great on the grilled fish and the corn tortilla were nice and warm. You could have pub chips, coleslaw, or fries with the entree.  Not a bad place to stop for dinner if you happen to be flying through Cleveland just don't expect stellar service and probably give one of the beers a try."}
{"text":"Airport quality restaurant. Being Great Lakes Brewing was hoping for better quality as I love their award winning Datmunger lager.  Food for a small plate of salad was at best mediocre.  Crab cake on top was cold and tasteless.  Get beer here and skip the salad."}
{"text":"Had about an hour and a half to kill before my next flight. We stoped in here for lunch and got a nice juicy burger, it was really good. Also got their Octoberfest beer and it was pretty good too. Only thing I would change is that for the price I could have used some more french fries with the meal and the bun on the burger just seemed kinda like the cheep frozen kind, and a little small for the burger, but I enjoyed my meal and watching football on the screens and even got a pint glass with their logo to take home."}
{"text":"I had to grab some food on my way back to LAX from a 4-leg, 4-day, crazy and frickin' cold business trip through the arctic tundra of the East and Midwest...  Food was just ok...and didn't even really feel up to a beer, so I won't review that aspect.  The service was sluggish at best and sure, it was an airport terminal so I am not expecting white glove service...  I'd say it was passable for a meal on the road...and that's that!"}
{"text":"Beer served in a glass that tasted like dish soap and fish sandwich was LITERALLY freezer burned fish sticks on a bun.  Sweaty waitress fanned herself with the menu as she mouth-breathed and hastily took our order (although it wasn't busy).  The bill was $45 for two shockingly shitty sandwiches and one small beer."}
{"text":"Based on past good reviews, I came to this airport restaurant in C concourse and got the Old World burger, with onion rings and a beer. It was a mistake to come here. Service was neither fast nor slow, but you need at least 30-40 min. The onion rings were good, but not the burger. It was dry, and tasteless - inedible without ketchup. For $26 I expected more. I will not return. This airport could use a B-line burger or Five Guys. Next time, I will go to Chick-fil-a or Potbelly. More reasonable and better food."}
{"text":"Very rude service. We tried to sit by a window to see planes and were told the section was closed and we had to move. Put up a sign or something! We got up and left."}
{"text":"Great food for an airport but go for the beer. Many to choose from and the larger I tried was excellent."}
{"text":"Very slow bar service. Either understaffed or the barmaid was just lazy. She was very rude. From now on, anyone flying United should keep walking past them and go to Winners and see Kim!  100% better!!"}
{"text":"Agreeing with one of the previous reviews, this joint get's 5 stars for being a great bar for an airport. Airport everything is synonymous with sort of sucky and Great Lakes bucks that trend.  I had a hoagie and a big ol cup of pills and was more less pleased with both. The hoagie is pretty drippy and is more of a fork and knife affair. It's not fantastic but once again, in the spectrum of airport food it's good.  If you're familiar with Great Lakes Beer, you know it's pretty solid. I'm not huge on their IPA but i think their pils is great. Almost tastes as good as some of the Pacific NW varieties"}
{"text":"Sandwich was surprisingly good. The onion rings were terrible. The beer was local and was great for before a flight. They should stop showing cnn tho. Esp on a day when there was a plane crash."}
{"text":"If you happen to find yourself hanging around in the Cleveland airport, Concourse C, either pray for yourself OR wander on over to Great Lakes.  The beer was particularly tasty - MUCH better than you would typically find in an airport (unless you happen to find the Sweetwater Brewery in the Atlanta airport, but I digress).  The food is a-ok, nothing spectacular, but getting a cold, on-tap, craft beer while waiting for a plane takes Great Lakes up to 4 solid stars.  By the way, I had the Dortmunder, which won a Gold Medal at the 2010 World Beer Festival.  It was DAMN good."}
{"text":"We had a horrible time. The service was good but we had to wait 1 hour for food. I had the crab cakes that had a burned bottom and it tasted like rotten sea food. Another person in our party had the burned to a crisp black bean burger. But the fish and chips were pretty good. Overall we will not be coming back soon."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a layover. The restaurant is located between Terminal C and D. There are several TVs, and bar seating as well as tables and a few booths. Cheezy muzak playing; that's weird, given that this city houses the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame. Oh well... I was greeted and got to pick my seat.  I selected the Burning River Pale Ale and the Old World Burger. Both were good, not great. Beer was tasty, but left me wanting a little more taste. The burger was slathered in BBQ sauce and had some crunchy things on top, both of which I appreciated. I did order it medium rare, and it was more like medium well, but I didn't really expect it to come out pink. It's an airport grill...  Worth a pit stop; I wouldn't say I have undying love for it."}
{"text":"I always try to keep my bias in check, but it gives me such great pleasure in calling my favorite micro brew a home town establishment.  The great robust flavors of their many brews are awesome and their themes are true to the town. I travel all of the time and have the advantage of enjoying many great brews from the Pac NW, New England, Texas, and California, but Great Lakes is number one in my book."}
{"text":"Good beer, terrible service, staff appears to have no patience. I won't say they are rude, but it's definitely pleasant."}
{"text":"I struggle with this since I know it is an airport location, I should expect high prices and bad service but I just want to warn other travelers. They get 5 stars for the amazing beer that I love, they lose 1 star for terrible service and another for ridiculous prices.   I paid $7.20 for a \"short\" beer, the Holy Moses Belgian white ale was amazingly delicious but $7.20 is just stupid.  They weren't terribly busy, when the gentleman next to me sat down and asked the bartender what beer he should get the waitress pointed to the menu and said \"That's why I gave you the menu\" and turned around. I know it is an airport and they are under pressure to get people out the door very quickly but you opened a brewpub, you should at least attempt to educate people about your beer especially since you sell 6 packs to go."}
{"text":"Beer good, appetizers inedible and disgusting. I know the standards for dining need to be adjusted for airport food but, even by adjusted standards, the food we ordered was just gross. The waitress was super pleasant and the service was completely fine. It's what happened in the kitchen that was all wrong. Stick to brewing beer please."}
{"text":"I come here every time I fly out of Cleveland.  Great Lakes is the best spot in the terminal and maybe even the whole airport.  They have pretty good food options whether you are trying to eat dinner before your flight or just share some appetizers with friends over a few beers.  And the beers are excellent!  Their regular release beers like the Commodore Perry IPA and Elliot Ness Lager are two of my favorites.  Most of the seasonals are great as well.  A must try for beer enthusiasts or anyone killing time in CLE.  Plus Cheri is the best bartender in the game.  I've seen her keep the whole bar fed, drinking and happy by herself.  All of them have a great knowledge of the beers.  They will get you in and out fast if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"be very mindful that if you get stuck in concourse C of the Cleveland airport and there are delays at the airport, this place (according to a manager) \"stays open to keep the airlines happy.\" My observation: the employees sure don't seem to be happy about it.   I didn't make it beyond my iced tea and would rather starve before giving this place another dime!"}
{"text":"The wings are outstanding. Really tender and the sauce is great. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Really good crab cakes and the beer isn't bad either!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent place, especially for an airport bar.  The chicken wings aren't wings, they are fried strips of breast meat. The sausage is OK, not good, and certainly not great.  The beers are all good and local :)).  The service was good, and prompt.  Next time I fly out of/through Cleveland, I'll stop in."}
{"text":"The Cleveland airport is small enough so that if you are flying out of Terminal A and you have an hour plus, you can walk 10 minutes over to Terminal C and enjoy a drink at Great Lakes Brewing.  Thank goodness!   I love that they have so many of their beers on draft at the airport.   We ordered a black bean burger and a chicken Caesar wrap as well.  They present the food beautifully - I was surprised at how nice the plating was.  The burger met my needs - I was a little disappointed with the fries - they were not fresh and lacked the seasoning that I Ioved at the GL on Market. Service was good. Definitely check out Great Lakes at the airport."}
{"text":"The local beer is great, but I have to give this place one star for service.  This was in the C-wing of Hopkins.  I seated myself with no wait, but then proceeded to wait about ten minutes for someone to even recognize I was there. This is simply not acceptable in an airport.   After the sever (who was friendly despite being late) finally arrived and apologized, I placed my order and then waited almost another twenty minutes for a salad.  A salad.   I can't say I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had such a great meal here while waiting for my flight. There was great atmosphere and the service was good even though it was crowded. Prices are high but the portion was good so not a real complaint.   The beer battered fish and chips platter was flavorful, crispy, fresh and so filling. Loved every bite. There were also lots of TV screens so it had a good sporty atmosphere without being too bar-like."}
{"text":"The beer is great but the service is terrible. The music is really loud. Not exactly a stress reducer at the airport. Food is avg at best."}
{"text":"I had the Cajun gumbo with chicken and it was good. As limited as airport food can be this is a good choice."}
{"text":"This breaks my heart to write. They once had a menus that matched the amazing beer. Beer still amazing. The staple of the Cleveland community. Food, not so much. Pretzel chicken, was once legendary in the Early 90's. Huge helping, like two huge breasts. Moist, rich, amazing. Now just a dried us mess wanting to be more. Burgers ordered medium rare, just came out raw and mushy.  The fries remind me of Burger King fries. The didn't seem real. Definitely out of a frozen box and highly processed. The 4 sausage sampler was 4 small pieces. Over cooked and dry. It looked liked it sat under a heat lamp for a day. Even the mustards were dried out and had skin. It was bad. Beer, awesome, drink there eat somewhere else. Cool atmosphere. There's a \"real\" Bullet hole behind the bar."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE.  This place was a little farther away from my gate but since my flight had been delayed I decided to walk and give it a try. I really wish I hadn't. I walked in and since it was self seating, I sat down at one of the tables, but didn't seclude myself to Make sure that I would be served. I sat there for 20 mins. Not a hello, not a water, not a drink NOTHING. There was a server who walked by me several times and made sure she plaid plenty of attention to the group of guys she was serving but never one did she stop by to ask me anything or to apologize for having me to sit there without having being greeted or even serving me a glass of water. I saw her talking to another server and nodding her head towards me, possibly to indicate that I had been sitting there. I waited patiently, and still no one came over. They both stood there and watched me walk away and still never apologized. The place was not full, it seems like they're rather stand around talking to each other and flirt with customers. Such a disgrace to the airport."}
{"text":"Five stars because of the beer not the food.   If you love beer and live near Cleveland just go here. This is not a local watering hole, prices are not cheap, and the food is too fancy and overpriced for my taste.  That being said, it is still my favorite beer around. I love IPAs so I recommend the Alchemy. ..dang...Chillwave (everyone hates the new name so I beg of you to change it)  If you are reading this review that means you have never been here.  So here is what you should do - put on some decent looking clothes, grab a date, go have a meal and drink some amazing beers.  Do this in the summer and sit on the patio. You will not be disappointed I recommended this place.  Side note. If you love beer as much as me then sign up for their Beer School event.  Register early since they fill up months in advance. Just go to the website and sign up.  You will thank me for telling you about it."}
{"text":"This airport restaurant was good. I was pleasantly surprised.   Our server was friendly and attentive. The kitchen was fast.   The brat and pierogi dish was good. The pierogi potato and cheese stuffing was really tasty and the brats were good too; the skin was not tough. It was served with Dijon mustard that went well with the Dortmunder Gold Lager bratwurst."}
{"text":"Good beer selection and the ones I had, brown ale and porter were good (especially the porter). Had brats and pierogies, but since I'm not from an area where this is commonly served, I may not be the best judge. I did enjoy them, for what it's worth. Service at the bar was a bit slow."}
{"text":"Well on a long layover on Christmas day so I thought why not pop in for a burger and a brew.  Couldn't decide on the brew so I chickened out and had a soda instead.  I did get a burger and onion rings.  Place is a little tight with all the folks and their multiple carry on bags and strollers etc.  But the staff is friendly and seems to be well versed in dodging and jinking around luggage that doesn't always seem to stay in place.  Food is good.  I had the Old World Burger.  Came out hot and juicy.  Thankfully I missed getting the front of my sweatshirt with the juices that seemed to be dribbling out of everywhere.  Burger had BBQ sauce made with one of their home brews.  it was good and added a nice flavor twist to what normally passes for BBQ sauce up here.  My burger also had bacon, two mini onion rings and a thick slice of cheddar cheese holding it all together all on a roll for a bun.  Overall really a good burger.  They hit the cooking temp right on for my order.  Onion Rings were really good.  Not too much batter but nicely covered and with a nice flavor.  Not sure if they use some of their home brew in the batter or not but it was very flavorful.  Wish I could transplant this place to back home.  It is not very convenient to visit this establishment for the rings and burgers unless I am traveling somewhere."}
{"text":"***** Beer ***** To-go option  Um so anyone from Cleveland typically knows about Great Lakes Brewing, and mostly enjoys it/them as much as I do.  I try to make it out to the brew/restaurant downtown Cleveland when I can, but if I can't I typically always fly United since it's the only one way to Los Angeles where I live.   If I MISS the opportunity to get their great beers while I'm- I shall not fret, since they offer TO-GO (YES I SAID IT - TO-GO!) option of bringing various 6-packs and 4-packs as a carry on.  Yes.  Beer carry on.  I haven't had the food at the airport, so I can't vouch for that. I know the food is good at the restaurant (I know that doesn't help you here) - but at least you know it COULD be good.   It's all about the beer people. Grab yourself one before your flight, find out which you like, and have a 6-pack for the road... no wait... sky?"}
{"text":"Great Lakes offers a very nice classy setting offering foods that go along with their style of Beers. I mean this by offering the highest quality foods from local farms. Everything I've had from Great Lakes has been fantastic, great service along with great Beer of course. I don't have anything bad to say because I go there more than the average person who might write reviews. I'm there twice a Week! That gives you a kind of trust to believe my review. I'm like the new Great Lakes better than the old Great Lakes. The old Great Lakes was very predictable in the Beers they sold, I mean this by each Season you knew what Beers would be at the Pub or at retailers, now the new Great Lakes it seems they're trying new things always offering new Beers during random parts of each Season and as a Beer geek I can honestly say I love this! Keep doing great you guy's and please never sacrifice quality for quantity."}
{"text":"Decent food and service for an Airport Bar/Restaurant. Definitely better than Panini's!  Most importantly, they sell sixers that you are allowed as a carry on. One per person. If you are passing through (Terminal C), be sure to try one of the many rotating beers from Cleveland's pioneer microbrew."}
{"text":"Maybe if we had ordered a drink, my rating would be higher. We were simply hungry and wanted to grab a bite at the Cleveland airport and the food here did not stand out.  My Old World Burger was more overcooked than medium. The pretzel bun was not bad and the onion rings that came with my burger was the best part of the meal."}
