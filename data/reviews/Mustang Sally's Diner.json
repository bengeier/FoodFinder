{"text":"Service was wonderful! Got the BLT and it was good. We happened to be buying a car and got hungry so we just headed over to Mustang Sally's by a door connected to the Ford Country dealership."}
{"text":"I stop in here every time I have a service done to my car. The staff is always friendly. This morning, I came in with my 5 month old and we had an amazing experience. Everyone stopped to say hi to Abby and she loved watching everyone work. I ordered a coffee and a vegetable omelette. When my coffee came, my waitress brought me water without me having to send her on a second trip. The omelette was wonderful! The veggies were fresh and my sourdough was toasted just right. Can't wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp as a breakfast spot between Vegas and a day trip to the Hoover Dam. Absolutely worth the short detour from the highway. We were greeted immediately with menus and waited no time for our friendly server to take our drink orders. 
It was a quiet Wednesday morning, but the chef still seemed to be very busy, as there were quite a few takeout orders for employees of the Ford dealer next door. 
I ordered the pancakes which were huge and so very filling. My husband ordered the veggie skillet which was so delicious and a large portion. 
It feels like a step back into the 60s with the awesome theme and decor of the restaurant, and is made better by the friendly service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"A mutually beneficial relationship. Great diner and great ford dealership. Will have me coming back to both! Breakfast and lunch options until 3pm. Wonderful."}
{"text":"Great diner fare. Good food, good flavors, reasonable prices and great menu selection. Breakfast and lunch served all day. Awesome service from the waitresses, but the kitchen gets bogged down with orders from the dealership employees so even when the dining room is empty, the kitchen still gets slammed. Overall I've enjoyed Mustang Sally's for several years and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Really good hidden gem. Service was very friendly. The food is good too and really good value."}
{"text":"What a neat concept.  A 50's diner located at the Ford Car Dealership.   The food was amazing.  Definitely will be back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I never know when I will have time to schedule  maintenance on my Ford F150 and Ford Country in Henderson is the only place I will take it.  Great news is they are the home of Mustang Sally's Dinner.  What a great way to kill the time.  I just had a California Omlet that was very fresh and tasty.   Staff super friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or anytime food. The wzitress we has was super amazing she was african american very cheery and she made the best malt ever.  Def gonna go back. Price is right too."}
{"text":"We were at the stratosphere for a night and I came across this place by chance. The food was great, really tasty. The ambiance was \"throwback\" witch I loved. And the customer was really good. It's a bit strange because the restaurant is literally next to a Ford dealership. But a really nice to to check out nonetheless. If you are visiting Vegas and want to get way from the strip, check this place out."}
{"text":"Loved it! Definitely coming back. It's inside the Ford dealership so as soon as you park there's a salesman coming towards you. Our server was very friendly. We ordered the garden omelette and BBQ bacon burger and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I bought this great deal on Groupon and made it here not once but twice and that's all because I truly liked it. I love that the servers treat me good and make me feel welcomed!"}
{"text":"Mustang Sally's is the cutest little diner! I love the whole set up. It's very clean. The food are service are amazing !"}
{"text":"There aren't enough places like this around! Cool atmosphere, friendly staff, and amazing food! It's got a 50's diner theme (I'm 26 so its what I imagine it'd be like) and the food to go with it. Burger and shakes. Basket of chicken and fries. I work nearby and have been eating here for quite some time now and have never once been let down. Quality fresh food and a price I am more than happy to pay. And REAL shakes. Not that cheap garbage at fast food chains. If you're looking for a laid back place to get good service and a tasty meal stop by this place. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I came here for the mustang experience.  It wasn't bad. We came  right before closing and were the only patrons in the diner. The service was good.  Our waitress was friendly. The food was ok. I would give this place another try. Maybe I'll get an oil change on my mustang and venture in while I wait."}
{"text":"Cute diner, good service, food was excellent, prices very reasonable. There were 3 of us and we all agreed the fries were the best we ever had anywhere. Hamburgers were large and very good. Can't wait to try breakfast there."}
{"text":"Great food and service! You've gotta try the fries...best ever! The food was hot and the quality was really good."}
{"text":"Good Diner food, friendly service, really good groupon deal. worth a check out. Downside old bathrooms out in the old showroom.. time for a remodel."}
{"text":"I really like Mustang Sallys.  I bring my car for its mileage-due services and I usually wait in this very calming dining area.  They have very reasonable offerings.  What I liked the best is that they served 'chocolate energy drinks' to the bicyclist club (on a particular weekend).  I believe it was complimentary or perhaps not.  But it was intriguing and made me want to become a cyclist."}
{"text":"Smart idea, clean and good service. I would suggest for anyone waiting at any of the car shops while their car is being worked on."}
{"text":"Like going back in time.  Not just great comfort food, but GREAT SERVICE, GREAT people and just a great place!  Don't underestimate the business name.  It's like no other dinner."}
{"text":"1 star for two reasons...
1. They give you a free shake only if you give 4 or 5 star review. I'm not looking for free anything. And you shouldn't have to bribe your customers to give you 4 or 5 Star reviews.
2. Evidently.... when you pay for shake you don't get a full one


Update! 
So 16 months after I leave this review I  received this private message from the business today...

\"I find it really inappropriate to give a review like that with no proof about the yelp and a free drink. In your picture is nothing to see but if you write a review you get a free one, where does it show if you write a 4 or 5 star review? There is nothing to see on this picture, probably, because it's not the truth! If you put something like that out to me and there is nothing to see on this picture you're a straight out liar and I can't take you review serious! So where is the proof. I don't see anything wrong in getting a free drink, if you write a review. But somehow the 4 or 5 Star part is missing, or not even true!\"

Readers, please note that in the picture of the sign second line from the bottom 
                      \"4 or 5 star review only\"

As far as I'm concerned Mustang Sally still owes me 2 ounces of milkshake that I paid for."}
{"text":"Didn't realize tat this place was in a Ford Dealership, but the food was good.  Stopped here on the way to the Hoover Dam and enjoyed it.  Skillets were a little greasy, but still delicious."}
{"text":"Found this gem while shopping for a new vehicle!  Love the whole diner appeal and it's right at the Ford Dealer - cool concept.  Food is great, atmosphere is nostalgic and service is wonderful - Alexis was a great server!"}
{"text":"Sally's earns five stars for their orange juice and pancakes alone. Great place for a breakfast date while you get you oil changed."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the services were all super nice. It made getting my car worked on a lot more pleasurable."}
{"text":"Ever since they raised their prices, on some items by $3 or more, I have stopped going to this place for breakfast since it's near by when I got to or am at work. I guess this is inflation to pay for the new remodel? Horrible pricing, will be looking for a new place to get breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito made my morning wait great while my car is in service at country ford. Great service and quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the customer service here was amazing. 5 starts for that alone! The food on the other hand was not my favorite. I ordered a philly cheese steak with fries. The fries were amazing, the philly on the other hand, fell through for me. It could have used a little more salt, and it was too greasy for me. My fianc√© got a bacon cheeseburger and enjoyed hers! I would definitely give this place another try, it was definitely going in the right direction."}
{"text":"Such a great find.  Where else but in Nevada would there be such a cute little 50s diner inside a Ford dealership.  Staff was super friendly and the food was delicious.  I had their banana shake.  So, so good!i had the cranberry chicken salad.  Such a generous portion .  I would come back again."}
{"text":"I give this 3 stars for the type of place it is, Diner food. Food was ok.I came for lunch with my daughter while I got me car serviced at a different dealer. Service could have been friendlier but I guess what do you expect in a car dealership. The food took awhile for a quesadilla and buffalo fries. It seemed pretty clean."}
{"text":"I had the classic chees burger and fries.  The burger was cooked as ordered and tasted great.  The fries were the best I have had in a long time. Great food, friendly and great service."}
{"text":"Foods not bad good place to relax while waiting for your vehicle to get serviced. They have good shakes & breakfast food."}
{"text":"Really, really bad. Interesting set up, it's attached to a Ford dealership, which should hopefully tell you all you need to know. All of the food that I saw come out of the kitchen was frozen food product (including my over cooked, incorrect burger). 

Service is slow and rude, mistakes were made and not quickly or appropriately handled, AND the meal that was correct- a club sandwich wasn't really a club sandwich! No avocado, shredded prices of ham and turkey, then not cut adequately. Just because you put another piece of bread in the middle doesn't make it a club sandwich!"}
{"text":"Mustang Sally's used to be a nice dinner, with the 50's or 60's atmosphere. It has changed so much, with a look of barely alive, trying to look like a  Star Bucks dinner, yet falling short of that mark. The counter where the cash register used to be is dusty and it looks like it is basically ready to close down. The people that wait on you are not trained for a restaurant, but simply order takers that act like they don't want to be there. Another nice place gone away; it is too bad."}
{"text":"the French fries are best in town! my kids love them.  I buy my cars from the attached Ford dealership just to eat here.
the waitress is always friendly to us also."}
{"text":"Server was very curious and the food is reasonably priced.  I had the spicy chicken wrap with onion rings."}
{"text":"Seriously, the worst diner food. Ordered an Ultimate Scramble, every last bit was drowned in grease. Ironically, the hashbrowns were burned. Absolutely flavorless. 
It's attached to the Ford dealership- I know that alone should have been a sign. Denny's has better food than that. 
The interior was sort of charming. Service was OK, although the wait staff kept talking smack about a guest who didn't tip
Unless you are dying from hunger, go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Had the Crunchy Chicken Spinach Salad while waiting for my oil change and it was totally great. Service was fine, though the place was nearly empty.

The decor involves a lot of red, black-and-white checkers, that nostalgic glitter diner furniture, and a bit of automobile nostalgia. My coffee was slightly stale, but that's any diner for you. I could have asked for a replacement.

This is also the first place I've seen in Henderson with an actual lunch counter, if that's your thing. I'm sure there's gotta be more lunch counters in Henderson..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in Henderson. I come here whenever I have to drop my car off at the dealership. Great little hidden gem."}
{"text":"Food was fast clean restaurant  they are very good condition good clean restaurant good sevcie"}
{"text":"Yes, I am actually reviewing a diner inside and attached to a car dealer (
Ford Country, to be exact)!  I was at the Mazda dealer next door and waiting for my car to be finished and inquired where I could get a bite to eat - who knew?

The reason I felt so compelled to \"yelp\" about Mustang Sally's is because I'm still having thoughts about my visit - and they are good lingering thoughts!  (If only I could have a date these days that left me with the same impression....)  I had the \"Monster Burrito\" which was $8.95.  When I asked the server if it was good she recommended and said she'd get the red enchilada sauce put on the side, since my leftovers would then warm up better.  Oh, was she correct - I had leftovers!

I crave mexican food since I've moved to LV from Chicago, where a \"burrito as big as your head\" is a very common and good late night food!   Well, this burrito was HUGE and unbelievably good.  Rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, cheese, ground beef and sour cream inside with a bit of melted cheese of top - small side of chips & salsa.   I brought the other half home and almost couldn't wait to have the leftover!!  The folks who work at Mustang Sally's were very pleasant as well and kept refilling my water and iced tea.  As I sat at the counter, I watched the food that was being served and I must say it all looked pretty good and pretty large portions as well.

Was this the best burrito I've ever had?  Not THE best - but the best so far in Vegas on my continuous search for burritos and mexican food in general.  (I have a few more reviews to write on the others I've tried.)  But I will say that I need to go back to the dealer before month end and Mustang Sally's will be a DEFINITE part of the agenda for that day!!!"}
{"text":"I order from work and by the time I get there its hot and ready.  Fast service and great food and reasonable.  Beats cheap fast food by a mile.  I get the burgers and potato salad and its delicious.  Service from staff is fast and attentive."}
{"text":"Great food. Killed some time while waiting to get my car serviced. you don't really need the excuse!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Food is good and the customer service is AMAZING and I needed that after dealing with Nissan right next door and their crappy attitudes! Ford is smart to have this type of place for their customers. Although I'm not a customer of Ford this made my wait worth it. Everyone is so friendly!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places I had heard about but never tried.  I saw they had a Groupon so I bought it and finally made it over.  I ordered the Breakfast Burrito, hubby got the Meat Skillet and we shared the Captain Crunch French Toast.  The french toast is fire.  Way better than the Crunch Berry French Toast at Sunrise Cafe.  I was surprised but this place is really good. I had a Vanilla Coke.  I can never resist one at a diner.  They have a few interesting items like a Breakfast Club Sandwich and Fried Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwich.  Service was good, a little slow but there was only one server for the whole place and she had quite a few tables.  Prices are very inexpensive.  I think everything is $10 or less."}
{"text":"This is a nice themed diner. The food is reasonably priced and the service is fast and friendly. Today was the second time I went here and I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for themed restaurants....especially if it's diner style too.

I was getting my car washed at another dealership but it was a short drive to Ford. (could have been walking distance but walking in 105+ degrees...no thanks.) Mustang Sally have their own separate entrance so you can walk straight in and bypass any car salesman. 

Menu may only be two pages but you're bound to find something that suits your cravings. You got your burgers, sandwiches, salads and breakfast/omelettes/skillets are served all day. I got the meat lovers' skillet and boyfriend got the California omelet. Portions are pretty big. Definitely will fill you up plus you might have some leftovers. Also, what's a diner without ordering a vanilla coke!!!?? =) Yum! I always gotta have one whenever I'm at diners. 

I honestly won't go out of my way JUST to come eat here but if I'm ever going to get my car serviced around the corner, I'll come stop by again for a bite to eat. Next time, I would try the patty melt. I saw a lot of people ordering their burger baskets. Those look pretty tasty too."}
{"text":"Great service. Fried green beans are the best. We come here Almost every Saturday for breakfast."}
{"text":"Great little spot in the MIDDLE of a dealership. Didn't think this was possible but I guess all can happen. Clean, and positive vibe in diner."}
{"text":"Not bad not great, it's good but I didn't realize it's in a dealership. Food is made fresh everything is cooked to order and prices are good. It's really clean and staff is really kind and efficient. Wouldn't seek it out but if I was in the area I'd call in a sandwich and go back to work. I will say they make their own cherry coke which was really good and their onion rings are definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"1950's-style diner in a Ford dealership. Cute idea! 
Restaurant was clean, service was friendly and fast. No frills diner food that was very good! Whether you're buying a vehicle or not (we were not), I recommend stopping in for breakfast or lunch. Open until 3pm."}
{"text":"We were a little surprised to pull into a FORD DEALERSHIP to eat at Mustang Sally's....but what a cute idea!! This retro diner was adorable and the perfect place to stop for breakfast on the way to the Grand Canyon. Our waitress was super sweet and provided excellent service! The food was great! The only dish we were not raving about was the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were fluffy and light and VERY good. The gravy was bland and needed more chunks of sausage which would have added more flavor. 

Our waitress did make recommendations and she was spot on! I had a breakfast skillet that was simply incredible (the kind of breakfast that you think about weeks and months later!).  Everyone else in our party was very happy with their order as well (we got the biscuits and gravy to share and we were glad that it was not anyone's \"meal\". 

I won't hesitate to come back next time I'm in Vegas or suggest it to my friends when they are visiting. Great breakfast, fast friendly service and decent price."}
{"text":"Love this place, I've been 3xs since I find it! Everything has been amazing we had the club sandwich,it was hot, man it was yummy! The French toast my daughter had was excellent. Oh and the salad and chilli mmmm mm mm oh and the Philly and shakes are good oh man making myself hungry! Ohh almost forgot, they don't have them daily so it kinda sucks but they make homemade dessert my favorite is the cupcakes, they had strawberry the first time we went(sadly they haven't had them since..I've called a few time lol I'm obsessed with cupcakes ) but I the service is great the girls are very nice and the food is fresh and yummy everytime"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was good.  Cute little diner inside Ford Country.  We were out car shopping & ended up here."}
{"text":"Always fast good service.  Great atmosphere and cars to look at outside.  What more could you want ??"}
{"text":"Classic 50's themed diner.  Our food was good, the chocolate malt was great.  Our server was very friendly.   We ordered a lot of food and took some home.  My favorite thing other than the malt was the buffalo chicken wrap.  I didn't love that the restaurant is on the lot of a Ford dealership and a salesman came to the car as we parked.  I used a Groupon here."}
{"text":"I brought my truck in for an oil change,  hadn't had lunch, & was looking at quite a wait so into Mustang Sally's I went. At the recommendation is Alexis, my server, I ordered the Chicken & Bacon Melt with onion rings. It was delicious!! The chicken was seasoned nicely, the bacon was crisp, & the tomatoes that I added had really good flavor. The whole sandwich was very satisfying & big enough that I couldn't even finish it! The onion ring batter was crispy & also had a nice flavor. Service was prompt & friendly. This was a perfect way to help pass some of my wait time.....It's a really good thing I don't work at Ford Country because I'd probably spend a good portion of my paycheck here! YUM!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place and will for sure return. Make sure to check out their groupon as it is an amazing deal. Waitresses/ staff are very friendly. Love the environment and feel of this little 50s diner! Great for families, make sure to try their onion rings as they are to die for! Pics to follow!"}
{"text":"This is our first time here as we are getting our vehicle serviced. Our food was amazing everything tasted amazing. The kiddos meal was big enough for two little ones an there ranch is sssooo good!!!! I also had a latte which was on point as well sweet enough for my taste. Overall great service, great food, and great experience. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Staff is super nice and friendly, but food is worst I ever taste. Steak is bitter and didn't smell and didn't taste like meat at all, lookalike it cooked, frozen and warmed up. Ew!  Fish n chips -fish don't taste like fish and don't smell like fish... crust is burned. Only salad and French fries is ok."}
{"text":"Discovered this place with a Groupon, only about a mile from where I visit a friend, but had no idea about this place hidden in the Ford motors place.
This is one cool diner! Very clean, staff friendly and efficient.  Ordered the breakfast club with hash browns, club was amazing and never seen such a pretty home made tasty hash brown before, it was a little greasy, so pat it down in a paper towel next time. 
Johan had the oatmeal and French toast which he loved.  Coffee was delicious and was refilled without asking.
Will be coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Great service...great food! Would definitely recommend. Love coming in on the weekend to have fabulous American food in a classic looking diner."}
{"text":"For my family, this is our \"go to\" diner restaurant when we are shopping down in the Henderson Galleria area.   Especially with the Groupon, the value can't be beat.  The 50's style atmosphere,  the delicious, good ole American diner food, and great service makes the place a winning combination.   And, who would have thought it would be located at a Ford car dealership?  (For my little boy who is a Disney Cars fan, he especially loves coming here :))  Check it out, my wife and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend took me here because he used to come as a kid, the establishment was very cute and clean. The employees were so attentive and customer service was honestly a 12/10! The food was so ono (delicious) and the prices were reasonable, you honestly get great portion sizes for the price. A must stop shop for sure, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Solid diner breakfast found here! Friendly service in the midst of car dealerships. Laid out like a classic American diner- think they also had a soda fountain. 

I've ordered eggs over easy in places where this means sunny side up; not so. Everything arrived hot, delicious and terrible (bacon and heart attack meat), butter at spreadable temperature, lovely toasted rye, perfectly runny egg yellows, crispy hash browns. In N Out has a better vanilla shake but so what?"}
{"text":"Used to love coming here for breakfast when it was a diner with real diner food. They have changed it over to a coffee and snack takeout. I don't bother coming here anymore. What a loss."}
{"text":"Cute little diner with great coffee and sugar in the raw!!!  Yay!  Nice laid back feel and the food is amazing and quite affordable.  Wait staff was fast and friendly.  All in all a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Great little cafe! Amazing staff and wonderful food! Burgers are amazing! Tvs with different channels playing and music. It's definitely a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"This place has great customer service and decent prices. The food was better than what we expected for the price."}
{"text":"The food was good.  Service was fast..  and not one smile was given out by any of the employees.  Maybe it was a bad day to them.."}
{"text":"I was waiting for my oil change and grabbed a bite to eat.  I got the chicken fingers and fries which is a pretty hard to thing to mess up but they managed to.  I sat right at the bar in front of the girls that were working and never once was offered a refill or asked why I only ate about 2 bites of my food.  Even the fries were horrible!
 
I ended up getting stuck with the whole bill for food I didn't even eat or like.. and if I remember correctly, even charged for Ranch Dressing.  
 
I will not be eating there again!"}
{"text":"If you are getting your car serviced anywhere along Gibson and your on foot go to mustang sally's in the Ford dealership it is the closest place to walk. Great diner food, friendly staff and it's quiet. Bring your laptops or tablets the WiFi is great.  I gave sally's 3 stars because of the hours 7 am to 3pm. They should be open until 5pm M-F and until 7 pm on Sat. Also, it is diner food. Although, the soups and dressings are made from scratch.  Don't forget the sally sauce when you order fries.  Other then that everything was great!!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years... I ordered the tropics smoothie.. So good.. I've also had their breakfast before.. Definitely will hit the spot...."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast, I was very impressed from the coffee, food, service and prices...I'll go back again even if I'm not getting my car serviced. Really Hometown Diner feel to this place"}
{"text":"Getting your car serviced or if your just in the area. 

Located at the Ford dealership. 

This place has great priced breakfast. 

I got the egg and cheese croissant. 

Would come back again and again!

One star loss because it takes so long after you order to get your food!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there once it was good. But also stopped for a burger and shake that what you want to get. It was great and the atmosphere is cool. Great service."}
{"text":"I went to lunch with a friend while waiting for her car to get serviced at another dealer. Chevrolet At the Autoshow Mall referred us there. It was quaint and nostalgic. The service was quick and the staff was bubbly and fast. The food was Great! I know when I go back to get my car serviced where I will stop and get a bite. It will be at Mustang Sally's Diner on Gibson in Henderson Nv. I like how clean it is, and the pleasant servers help the morale too! Thanks for the wonderful service and great assortment of lemonades. I wish I could give 10 stars! I'll be back!
Cheers,

Letisha M Taylor"}
{"text":"Cute diner love ford so had to get my car worked on and they brought me over to the diner to kill time. The girls are very sweet and great for conversation. Had the breakfast club filled me right up! Yum!! You can see the crew gets along and thats great! Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"I see that I am the first one to review this place in quite a while.  Let me fill you in.  This place is NO LONGER a full service restaurant.  There is no sit down service or a full menu.  It is a walk up place to order a very poor lunch meat sandwich and chips.  If you are at the Ford dealership and are dieing of hunger, then I guess come over.  However, do not go out of your way to come here"}
{"text":"Ok we was skeptic and was waiting for our vehicle. Damn good thing we tried this place. Been here in Vegas a year and tried everything form overpriced food that taste like crap and small portions. This place kicked ass. I have had a lot of chicken and waffles in my time form all over USA and this place just made the best I have ever had. This restaurant
 tucked inside a car dealership is cozy and cute. My wife is picket but loved her food they brought out fresh made salsa pico and was better then any Mexican diner ."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from grub hub, it arrived nice and hot. I ordered a veggie skillet with over medium eggs. That was good, cooked perfectly. For my 4 year old daughter I ordered a short stack and that was not so great. It had black spots the pancakes that I assume is from the grill and they tasted more like cake than pancakes. It was edible and my daughter ate it happily. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Such a great place to eat while waiting to get your new car or any service. The staff is so polite and patient. They did not get annoyed with my 18 month old nephew and if anything were extra helping hands. Such good comfort food and simple menu."}
{"text":"Great burgers, shakes, and customer service. Hidden inside the Ford Dealership but the restaurant is very nicely decorated. The french fries are some of the best in town!"}
{"text":"I visited here on a Saturday morning due to purchasing a Groupon with them. The menu options were great and I ordered a skillet breakfast that was amazing! I cannot wait to come back here."}
{"text":"There's noone in here and we can't find someone to help us. It's almost creepy 

It's such a cute diner and it's going to hell due to the bad help. Sad."}
{"text":"I like this little diner. We discovered it several years ago because I brought my Ford for service here. The diner is part of the Henderson Ford location in Henderson. 
I have always ordered breakfast before and it has been so great. Well, this time I brought some friends here and we had lunch. My burger was so over cooked I could not eat it. Too dry. My onion rings were almost burnt. I looked and several others had over cooked meat. I did not send it back. I took it home to cut up for my dogs. I think it was just the cook. He must have had a bad day. I will go back and try again since my previous experience has been good."}
{"text":"This is my second time at the diner. There is so much to love about it! The old-time, true diner feel, the customer service, and the mustang memorabilia. Oh wait! And the food! 

I've chosen a burger on both occasions and not been disappointed. They're fabulous! You get to choose the done-ness, they're hearty, and huge. Plus they come with tons of fries or a massive pile of onion rings. Let's talk about the fries. How about some of the best I've ever had? Good size and yummy breading. The bacon was a little over done for me but we're pulling at straws here. Last time we got my son the chicken fingers (holy cow, that's a KID portion?!!) which had a good crispiness, but not to the point of being crunchy and inedible.

Overall, great experience. Make sure to get the Groupon, it makes a great experience affordable (even for starving college students!). We'll be back."}
{"text":"We were picking up a car being serviced and had an appointment to speak with a salesperson about a possible trade in. We were a little early, and starving, so went into the restaurant. It is retro cute and clean. I cannot comment on the food, we waited an hour and 20 minutes and walked out. We told the salesperson, sorry, but we needed to leave and eat! Not his fault, but sadly, his loss. Don't go if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"This place is what it is, and it serves its purpose nicely. Just don't come in here expecting to be blown away.

Let's be honest - we all have those times were we have to get our cars worked on. It's often a drawn-out, lengthy procedure. At these places you often go bored and hungry for an hour or so. Fortunately, when Ford Country was built, they took this into consideration and attached a diner to the place. Smart move. Is this place any good, though?

I'll put it bluntly - Mustang Sally's is definitely better than I would expect for being a place attached to a car dealership/service center, but it isn't ever going to compete with a full-blown, stand-alone restaurant.

The food itself is actually very good. I have only ordered a few different things off of the menu, but I have yet to be disappointed food-wise. Last time I tried a spicy chicken melt with waffle fries - this thing was actually pretty damn good!

The service is subpar, though given what kind of a place this is I guess you can't overexpect. When I was in last, the waitress didn't seem too enthusiastic or attentive - I don't think she cracked a smile once, and on top of that she put a lemon in my water when I specifically asked for them not to put one.

The hours for the place aren't bad, though I wish the place was open for dinner - it would be nice for those of us who get off work late and have to have a car serviced in the later afternoon/early evening hours. 

All in all this place is good - nothing more, nothing less. If you're stuck at Ford Country getting some repairs done, you'll likely be pleasantly surprised and enjoy what you order - though I doubt you'll go out of your way to come back, at the same time."}
{"text":"We found this place by using a Groupon and so glad we did.  The service was outstanding! The food was delicious!  The prices are very reasonable.  Yes, it's attached to a Ford dealership but there was plenty of parking.  We will make this a regular stop when we're in Henderson."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!! Been coming here for years. Great customer service and lively/friendly staff. Yummy shakes and coffee selections too"}
{"text":"Brought my 83-year-old friend and it took her back! Best burgers and shakes in Las Vegas! Like a burger should taste!"}
{"text":"This is a DINER at a CAR DEALERSHIP.  It's not gonna be gourmet.  You have to know that going in.

That being said, I've eaten here a couple of times in a pinch.  I always get the soup.  My favorite was the buffalo chicken soup I tried (sounds weird but it's good)... however, it wasn't all that hot.  It was just kind of tepid.  Whatever.  It's food.  

Their iced coffees are goooooood.  They will add any syrups you want and they have sugar-free ones too.  The guy I usually see behind the counter really bends over backwards to make sure your drink tastes good.

I mean, three stars might be a bit generous, but it is what it is.  It's a car dealership diner.  It does the job."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a few months. New menu. Not a lot on it anymore.  Ordered a club sandwich. Bread toasted very dark. The turkey and ham were grilled. Never had a club sandwich with the meat grilled. The meat was burned. Not very good. Don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here and had some sausage and eggs while waiting for vehicle to be serviced. Restaurant was empty except for a few staff eating breakfast and some othe folks getting coffee. Food was pretty average fare, nothing crazy exciting. Staff friendly and attentive. Filled drink when it was low so there is that. I would eat here again if waiting for service. Nice diner food and feel."}
{"text":"Since I moved to Vegas I always make it my business to show this establishment how much I love the food and impeccable service. Ali, Jess, and Alexis are always very attentive, and overall very inviting every time I come in. You can also find good deals for dining here as well. I am a Foodie so I eats well on the Low Low though..lol
Couponing, always looking for an Awesome deal.

Before I almost forget..a special shot out and \"Thank You\"to the chefs/cooks."}
{"text":"This little diner is a smart idea and good for those waiting for their car to be serviced. The food is made to order and their fries are the best. The servers are a bit slow which is no excuse since it was almost empty. Overall food and price were good."}
{"text":"Getting service done on one of the vehicles and we always come here to eat. Food is always good and service with a smile."}
{"text":"With 40 years of Food Service under my belt, I know good value when I see it.  This place is a secret sleeper.  Outstanding food and service.  

The unorthodox location keeps this place from blowing up.  That's OK with me as I can always find a place at the counter.  Great burgers and shakes, but the Ham Steak and Eggs is my go to for breakfast.  GIANT ham steak compared to anyone in town. 

Put it in overdrive and visit this place!"}
{"text":"Discovered this diner at the Ford Dealership through Groupon... nice, clean friendly service with great food!

Have come back here several times since our first visit!

I simply love the breakfast club sandwich took me right back to when I was 10 years old! I'm in love...

There was a small Dagwood Sandwich place up the road from my childhood home... across the street from my primary school, uncle Ben would often stop there and buy me a sandwich picking me up from primary school.

Not your conventional American Dagwood. This is more of a South African \"hot\" Dagwood instead of the typical American \"cold\" Dagwood.

I'm in love..."}
{"text":"Cute little diner , food was decent. We will go back from Breakfast"}
{"text":"The food was great! Had the breakfast skillet and my hubby had chicken wings! Both awesome!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this little diner.  it is in the Ford dealership so make sure you dont miss it!  the food is good and relatively inexpensive.  They have a good selection from burgers to sandwiches.  The waitresses are very nice and cute.  The food comes out quick and hot.  

If you are going to be in the area or at the Ford dealership i would recommend this place.  Also make sure to get a certificate on restaurant.com!"}
{"text":"While you're waiting on your vehicle you can come in here and have some pretty decent diner style food"}
{"text":"Chicken salad with cranberries grapes cucumber fresh greens and our server was nice. Will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is not so great. I do not recommend anyone coming here to spend money. The service was okay but not how a diner should be. Blt, no mayo? Really? Weird. The toast was over toasted and very chewy. The bacon was over cooked. Ehh kind of place. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Wanted to come back here after first visiting over a decade ago as a little boy. I had what I learned today was a \"chocolate coke\" all those years ago and the memory of it drove me to look this place up now that I'm here as an adult on my own. Now that we have that out of the way...if you're on the fence with with this place just come here already. The portions are HUGE for the price. The staff are *beyond* nice and accommodating. We came here on a Groupon, our bill was $3-ish after we applied it but we wanted to tip them nicely to show them we appreciated the experience - before she even noticed the amount we left on the bill the waitress was already offering us some drinks to go, including the famous chocolate coke I came here for - on the house! Amazing experience, will be here again when friends and family are in town and we're in the area.

P.S. the chocolate coke isn't on the new menus they have but if you check the photos on here under the menu category it'll be on there, the pic of the old school white style menu"}
{"text":"I would give it 2 1/2.  Nothing bad necessarily just nothing all that great. Burger didn't really have much taste kind of on bland side. It's a nice theme for a diner some cool mustang memorabilia on the wall potential is there for a cool old school diner but falls short unfortunately"}
{"text":"This place actually made me look forward to getting my van dropped off for service! Id always get their breakfast sandwich for a good price of $4.50. Tasted fantastic & great service.

Unfortunately they almost doubled the price for some reason with their new menu. Everything tasted burned, almost like it had been rushed. Service was still good but it almost feels like a different restaurant to what it used to be. 

Sadly, this will probably be my last visit
 :("}
{"text":"Great 50s vibe place for a quick breakfast!!! Quick and friendly service and the omelettes are delish!!!"}
{"text":"Food was VERY GOOD and excellent service!  Love the old throw back diner look.
My husband and I ordered breakfast and it was nice to have an old school close to home cooking meal. Not to mention, lol I don't have to do the dishes!"}
