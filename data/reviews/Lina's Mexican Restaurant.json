{"text":"Every time I come to this place it's closed during buisness hours and I have went at least 5 times!! Extremely unprofessional!"}

Party of two, decided we should support the local community restaurant.
LINA'S
We immediately were greeted by the owner, seated and started with drinks, and Quesadilla appetizer. It was delivered hot, with all the proper sauces. The guacamole is excellent. We order two combination dinners that were hot, delicious, and very filling. All food is prepared and made fresh including the floor tortillas.
The prices were very inline with economy.
The owner answered all our questions, and the service was 5 Star."}
{"text":"I drive by this restaurant every time I go to the gym. I love great Mexican food and their food totally hits the spot! I had a wet shredded beef burrito. The meat was super tender and the green sauce was flavorful. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time and are very impressed with the quality of the food. We ordered asada tacos and an al pastor torta. The meat was flavorful, the torta was big and had fries on the side which are very good. They also gave us a bag of chips on the side like chipotle but didnt have to pay extra. The tacos taste very authentic. I now know ill never return to Roberto's again."}
{"text":"Great authentic mexican reminds of Moms home cooking,  too bad they don't have a liquor license so my wife can enjoy her micheladas!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Very authentic, which if you know real Mexican food, you know guacamole and sour cream are not always part of the dish. The owners are also the cooks. Reminds me of moms cooking."}
{"text":"The menudo is delicious, is the best munudo I have tasted in vegas , the place is clean and organize. Give this restaurant a chance you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is actually good! I would definitely come back again. The reason for the 3 stars is because the service lacks quality. Takes awhile to get your food plus the waiters are not very attentive. Also the decor of the restaurant could use a makeover! Tables and chairs in the restaurant don't even match, there are rips in the chairs. Overall it's OK"}
{"text":"Went here last week. This place is amazing. First off, it's very clean and everyone was really nice. Second, the prices were very good. And third, the food was authentic! Amazing dishes. I had chicken enchiladas with rice, beans and a salad. Loved the sauce. Reminded me I grandmas cooking. Maria our server was really nice and fast. And of course like every good Mexican restaurant, the chips and salsa were on point! Definitely going back again.

{"text":"I love Lina's!! My husband and I go there at least once a week. He gets so disappointed if they run out of horchata because it's amazing. Everything on the menu is great. It's a real authentic mexican restaurant which I have missed so much since I moved here. The smell of the restaurant, the family feeling, the great food.. so original!! Anytime we have friends visit, we take them to Lina's and they say the exact same thing. Lina's is great. I wish I could eat there every day and I wish more people knew about them!"}
{"text":"Tried Lina's first time last night. Got order to go. Was just reopened by original owners who bought it back a couple of weeks ago. Previous owner defaulted. I got wet chicken burrito w/red sauce, really good, had a lot of chicken. Wife got cheese enchilada also very good, plain for my taste though, I like spicy. I agree with Joseph S review, but only gave 4 stars for now as we got order to go haven't tried dine in, definitely will soon."}
{"text":"Yes the Son waits on tables and Mom cooks. I am white and blessed to have Mexican friends with Grandma's that make unbelievable soups. This place is right up there. Try the albondigas (meatball) sooo good. Lots of veggies. Check them out! We need to keep these great home cooking places around."}
{"text":"Mystery meat in everything I've had. I think my bacon breakfast bourrito was tongue and the groung beef tast like 50% floor sweepings."}
{"text":"We went their based on the great YELP reviews......boy we must of picked an off day, cause it was really bad !

Walk in the front door (shared by  Lola's gaming) and the restaurant reeked of Cigarette smoke -- makes you want to gag before you even sit down.  We should of turned around and left right then and there.

There were 2 people running the restaurant and we were the only customers.  The gal that took our order didn't even speak english !    The chef in back came out to assist with the language barrier.  Both very nice -- but it took awhile to order, because she couldn't understand us?!?

Once we got our food, it was not good.  The chips and salsa are nasty old greesy tasting --- We really wanted to like this place --- but I have to give it an honest review and it was BAD !!!

Then we went to pay the bill it took 10 minutes for our waitress to figure out how to use the credit card machine to pay.....UGH !   Totally Horrible experience !!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Chips and salsa are amazing! I had a wet burrito with shredded chicken and I have had many of these in my life by far one of the best! Didn't realize what treasure was so close to our house! Boyfriend had the grilled chicken chimichanga he loved it! He's planning on going back tomorrow to try the Hawaiian menu they have. Really amazing restaurant!"}
{"text":"Been here three times. Every time, service is great, fast, courteous, and attentive. Ceasar is a very nice guy. Last night he took the extra time to explain things for me. I appreciate the attention. Every time we come we try one new thing. We always get tacos though!!! The soft tacos are AMAZING!!! The hard shell tacos are huge, but just as good. My husband says he could drink the salsa with a straw. Last night we ordered a \"torta\" this is a Mexican style sandwich. Beans, your choice of meat, Pico, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, layered on a hoagie style roll that has been grilled. The \"torta\" is not for me. My husband loved it. The asada fries are my personal favorite! Get them with carnitas, CARNITAS ON EVERYTHING!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try some smaller local Mexican restaurants in our area and this one popped up on yelp. 
It's a really homey place kind of like visiting your friends house for dinner.  We had great service and very good food.  We enjoyed chatting with our server and the cook even stopped by to ask how our food was.  Such a nice man!  Shredded beef is excellent and the beans were so delicious.  My husband is not a bean fan and he loved these.  I didn't love the salsa but salsa is such a personal thing.  I am Hispanic and I know that every families salsa is a little different.  I've been to friends houses and tasted salsa exactly like this and didn't like it but they love it.  It's what you grow up eating.  All in all a good meal made better by great service.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, my husband and I decided to try it out. I ordered the rolled taquitos plate and hubby ordered the beef chimichanga. The salsa is too chunky for my taste, but it had great flavor. Our order came out and my food was delicious! Hubby loved his too, but they gave him chicken instead. Both dishes were fantastic! The reasons I'm not giving 5 stars is because their restroom is in need of a good cleaning, there were kids running in and out of the kitchen and all over the restaurant, and even though he liked the chicken it wasn't what hubby ordered. We'll definatly come back, and we'll make sure it's not on a UFC night (not a fan of the idiot drunk guy and his commentary)."}
{"text":"Lina's is a diamond in the rough. At first, I was a little reluctant to try the place out because, let's be honest, no Mexican food is as good as homemade Mexican food. However, I was pleasantly surprised.

Lina's has a clean, open atmosphere. Almost immediately, my party and I were greeted and seated. Our waiter, Cesar, was absolutely fantastic about explaining the menu and very patient with us as we made our selections. He made it a point to make sure we were happy with our food and that we had anything we needed or wanted.

The food was amazing. It's about as close to homemade Mexican food as you'll get. Cesar suggested the Awesome Wet Burrito and I would highly recommend it, as well. The menu had many options and was easy to read. Everyone in my party was tremendously pleased with what they ordered. PS: The California Burrito is HUGE! 

Cesar mentioned that Lina's is family owned and operated, which made eating there more special. He also mentioned that Lina's shows UFC and boxing with no extra charges. The restaurant has a projector for the customer's viewing pleasure.

I would highly recommend Lina's to anyone I meet. The warm and welcoming atmosphere and service combined with the food that tastes like it's straight out of abuelita's kitchen were MORE than I could have asked for on my quest for good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I grew up ten miles from the US-Mexican border and have found it quite a task to get really good Mexican food here. Enter Lina's. This place makes some super tasty dishes and the chavelas are really good, too! It's easily become our favorite Mexican joint."}
{"text":"Stopped here on my way to Arizona and I'm glad I DID!! Cheap Mexican food with amazing flavor. I recommend this little gem for travelers passing by Las Vegas. I ate the sopes and hard tacos"}
{"text":"Food was yummy! Authentic Mexican food. The BF rarely ever says Mexican restaraunt are good because they can't beat his moms cooking. He actually liked this place and said it was good! 

The only reason they get a 4 is because it is a little bit unorganized. It's obviously family owned and operated. Everyone is very friendly. We just couldn't tell who worked there and who was a patron. Uniforms and someone greeting as people walked in would make it a 5!"}
{"text":"Been there several times and the food is authentic Mexican.  It is family owned/run restaurant. Soups are exceptional.  Owner will make tortilla fresh if you ask. Everything we've eaten have great homemade favor, portions are large, and they will make your meal hot or middle, just. Oh, prices are very reasonable.   Can't beat that! We'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Went for some Menudo and was very disappointed with what we got.
1. No \"granitos\" 
2. Kind of cold.
3. No Handmade tortillas
We order coffee 
Nasty cheap coffee"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time. Great place but recently I kept checking to see if they were open and they're always closed. I don't know what's going on"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I receive the food, everything was fresh made to perfection the customer service over the phone and in person was absolutely great I haven't called back several times with questions about the menu online and the customer service lady was so willing to help me understand what they had and detailed and it was even willing to make something that wasn't on the menu for me I definitely will be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Don't waist your time on this place. I got steak fajitas but didn't come with cheese/guac/sour cream. I had to spit out the meat because it was fatty. Came with a salad but it consisted of was lettuce/no dressing. The salsa was awful"}
{"text":"So far so good:: it's kinda slow/ the salsa lacks something?? But it's salsa non the less, they have tv and a projector for parties:: I live where there hardly is no food:: so something in a corner like this sometimes can be surprising:: I had a cheese quesadilla :: hmmm:: and SURPRISE :: it was great:: came out hot, had all my cheese melted:: best of all a quality cheese taste.. Also the Chicken Shredded Enchilada passed go as well! Red sauce was good.. Again a huge surprise and a Happy Yay:: cause I live near this resturant:: 
The only down side is the bar next door and the smell leaks over :: bummer:: 
Service was at first non existent but then it turned into being cute! Mom and pops shop!"}
{"text":"This place was great! We knew the owner from a previous restaurant he used to own and when he sold it, we stopped going. I'm so glad we found him again. 
Food was authentic and greatly priced. Service was friendly and super fast! And their menu has a wide variety of options which is awesome! I am definitely will be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"After months or probably even years of driving by Lina's I finally stopped by yesterday morning to check what they had to offer. I probably stood outside for about 5mins wondering where the entrance was because it had the same entrance at Lola's gaming. You turn left to go to the restaurant and right or just follow the cigarette smell to go to Lola's. Anyway, I got to meet the owner/chef who was really nice and helpful. I ordered menudo for takeout. It cost me $9.75(ouch!). Pretty expensive! Was it worth it? Unfortunately, NO. It was good but not exceptional for me to go back and pay that much. Sad to say, I won't be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I got chicken burrito to go. Later I found big ass blonde hair in my burrito ewww. Not good"}
{"text":"So...  Boyfriend helped the owner's son at Home Depot and suggested we try this place. Told him everything was made from scratch. Sweet. I'm not bit on Mexican Food, but he is. So here we sit. 

Immediately, a basket of chips and home made salsa is brought out. Our drinks were ordered and while considering dinner, boyfriend devours the basket and the salsa, asking me to dare him to drink the cup of it... He's a weird guy. 

Anyway... I ordered a torta.. Spicy food is difficult for me to eat, so they were nice to accommodate me by using avocados instead of their guacamole that has peppers in it. 

Boyfriend ordered Birria. No need to accommodate him. He has a iron stomach and the will to eat everything that is consumable... Except asparagus and bell peppers.

... So...  I've eaten now and I made a poor choice of what to order. I just wasn't a fan of the dish. But boyfriend's food was delicious. I'm pretty sure I just don't know how to order for myself. =P 

I would happily return, just... Need to try something else."}
{"text":"Such a great mom+pop Mexican place! Authentic food and you can taste the freshness! I recommend to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Great service, excellent food. Not very expensive. Definitely a good place to have authentic Mexican food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place due to the Great reviews on Yelp. My overall experience felt like I was dining in someone's kitchen getting microwaved lukewarm leftovers. I wanted to like this restaurant. It is conveniently located and seems to have a following. I may have come on an off day. I hope their posole is great.
I have to admit that the cigarette smoke coming from Lola's is a turn off."}
{"text":"Visited them after a month hoping to see changes in service and man was I shocked. Under new management better specials better service! I will continue to come here for lunch and occasional dinner! Food is great and the value is great. I will recommend this place to everyone I know! Thanks Lina's!!"}
{"text":"Friendly, personable staff, good food and large portions.  I'll be going back again to see what else they have.  The California burrito is huge, but a bit on the dry side because we believe missing the guac and sour cream."}
{"text":"Definately family owned, bad part about small restsurants like this is that they dont hire actual waiters...usually a son, daughter niece handles this task and the downside to this is when there are more than 2 occupied tables service gets a bit sloppy but, everyone is very nice. Now to the food, if you are a menudo or pozole (pork and homony soup) fan please give this place a shot, tortillas are hand made for menudo and the pozole is made with niztamal which is the original way to make it. All the other dishes we've tried are good but, nothing to go crazy over. Ill come back for pozole for sure."}
