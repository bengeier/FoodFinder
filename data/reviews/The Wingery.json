{"text":"I haven't actually gone in and ordered from here personally but I have eaten their wings when my friends/roommates bring them home. 

These wings are heavenly and more importantly they're massive. From what I'm told it's a little expensive but this seems to be one of those instances where you don't mind paying a little more because the pay off is so worth it."}
{"text":"Last night I had the pleasure of eating at The Wingery for the first time. 

It's a cozy place. We immediately had a server at our table getting our drink order. Our server was attentive and very nice and took great care of us!  

Now, let's talk food, that's what this is really about. Their wings are really delicious, a good sized and meaty. On our wings we had the raspberry, honey BBQ, mango chili, and hot BBQ sauces. They raspberry was sweet, but not overly sweet. I expected the mango chili to be spicier, but it had great flavor. If you like really hot wings, I'd get the three-alarm sauce. Personally, I like things spicy, so I could have used a bit more spice in their sauces, but I'll know next time to get hot and three-alarm. 

As for other food: Their sweet potato fries are delicious, too! My Dad wanted a lighter dinner so he got fish and substituted the slaw for fresh fruit. So, if you want a lighter meal, they have options for you. He really liked his dinner. 

Another thing I REALLY loved is that they have inexpensive draft beer and it's served in chilled glasses. 

They also have a lot of other options on the menu. It was hard to decide, but since we were at a wing place, I chose the wings. Might go for a sandwich next time. LOTS of choices!

It's not a giant place, but we didn't have a problem getting a seat. It might be a bit more difficult on a weekend, though I haven't been there on a weekend, so that's speculation. They have a big, outdoor patio that would be great in the summer. 

Overall, it's a good place to eat and have a few beers! It's clean, has friendly staff, lots of menu choices, and good food."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Ordered during the buy one lb get a lb free promo so the wings may be different for the sake of the promo.

Ordered jerk and a hot flavour. The jerk was salty. The hot flavour was perfect amount of spice. Perfect amount of sauce. Each pound contained 6 wings. Size was average but the portion size was a tad bit less than average. Was told 20 mins to wait and they were ready in that time. Very fast for wings especially during the promo. Otherwise I wouldn't buy the wings at regular price."}
{"text":"If I could I'd give zero stars. Horrible service. Ordered 3 pounds of wings and got 16 wings. Offered by management to get 1 pounds of wings free...requested potato wedges as well....after told well then you pay for the wings...I don't have time for this. Sorry horrible service and management.  Won't be returning. First time here and highly disappointed."}
{"text":"They're not joking when they said \"size matters\", the wings here are giant. Not a lot of sauces compare to other places, but they have enough for you choose from. Had 1 lbs of wings with hot honey bbq and its delicious !!! this my new wings place!!  definitely coming back..."}
{"text":"Awesome wings! Big, crunchy, saucy and delicious! Our new go-to wings spot! Love the honey mustard and mango chipotle."}
{"text":"We love to go on Friday night for fish special, excellent!! Have tried several other meals and always good.  Great mom and Pop kinda stop.  Always friendly and clean.  Service sometimes is slow.  By far favorite place in town to go have beer and dinner."}
{"text":"If you're looking for large, meaty wings - this is the place. My personal fav sauce is swamp sauce. The early week $25 for 3lbs special is a total deal. It's  a small take out place -total bonus is that they also offer delivery. 
The sides (fries, deep fried mac & cheese) are meh. But I'm not ordering from  a place called the Wingery for the sides ;-) 
Overall, great value for my $$"}
{"text":"Wings are big and juicy and they dont shy away with their sauce. My go to wing place from here on."}
{"text":"Was quite excited when a wing place opened next door from us. 


I'm writing this review because we've ordered there 4 times in the past couple of months and wanted to give a proper review. 

Unfortunately we've really had multiple negative experiences. Really wanted them to be successful and welcome them to the neighborhood. 

Our issues with them are simply the constancy. 

Missing dips, forgotten dishes, stale garlic bread, some dishes are cold but the rest are piping hot. 

Really hoped this place would be the new spot for Apache court people. 

Hopefully they get things worked out."}
{"text":"Trust me when I say these are the best wings I've had yet. I've tried wings all over - All Stars, St.Louis, Wild Wings, Wacky Wings, Duffs and the list goes on. However, if you haven't tried The Wingery for their chicken wings, you're definitely missing out. High quality meat, fantastic texture, out of the world taste and don't even make me begin with the size of the wings. I travel from Toronto to Mississauga to get my fix of wings lol. I drive 20-25 minutes for wings at The Wingery and never am I disappointed with my wings. These damn wings - truly blessed by the chicken wing god."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, about $45 worth, they brought everything but the wings, waited another 30 minutes before they brought it and it was cold and under cooked not sure how that happens, if it had arrived on time it would probably have been more under done, maybe I was better off with the wings not being in the bag for delivery.

The wings were big, sauce was ok, but didn't like the fact I had to cook them in my oven after already waiting an hour and a bit for the whole order to be delivered. 

Was offered 10% discount on the next order as compensation. Unfortunately/fortunately will not order again."}
{"text":"Have been to this place quite a few times. They have one of the best chicken wings I've had in the GTA. The downside is that their quality varies significantly. One day you'll have the best wings or sloppy sandwich (chicken sandwich) you could have. Other days their food will be just OK. For the most part, their food is really good. Perogies are always on point though and would definitely suggest you trying it."}
{"text":"I was not expecting much from a take out place but the wings were absolutely amazing and I keep coming back. I always get them naked with salt and pepper and let me tell you, that the wings are extremely juicy and crunchy on the outside - simply perfect. I have also tried Dried Cajun a couple times. The wings had plenty of sauce and were lightly breaded. I cannot speak for the delivery service as I always get take out. I hope the Wingery will soon open in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I'm torn on my thoughts on the wingery. Let me just say that if you buy wings and get them 'dripping' you will be in for some good wings. The sloppy chicken sandwich for 5 bucks on Wednesday is also an awesome deal. My problem comes from them trying to nickle and dime their customers and also they practically force you to pay for the 'sloppy' sauce option because if you don't your wings won't have any sauce on them. I boycotted getting their wings a while ago when I got 2 pounds, sloppy, with a side of fries. The wings had barely any sauce on them, like I'm talking 50% dry, (and I got the sloppy option) and my side of fries was like 5 tiny potato wedges. Screw that. I'm of the opinion that the wings should be fully sauced without getting the super duper sloppy option, but apparently now you need to get it 'dripping' just to get a reasonable amount of sauce. And skimping hard on potato wedges? Bulk potato wedges are practically free they are so cheap, why are you screwing me out of 1 cent worth of potato wedges? How is that a good business strategy on your end?

Anyways, bottom line, the wings when ordered 'dripping' are really good, I would rate them at 4 or 5 out of 5. This places looses points because it basically tries to nickle and dime you so hard its unbelievable. By skimping on 2 cents worth of sauce and 1 cent worth of potato they lost the majority of my business (I do still get the sloppy chicken sandwich on occasion, they have never screwed that up thankfully). And them skimping out on sauce and sides wasn't a one time thing, its been getting worse and worse for a while, the order I described was just the straw that broke the camels back. Hopefully they get their act together in the future."}
{"text":"This place is a total joke. I've placed an order for 2lbs of wings, ended up getting 11 wings. I then weighted them on a food scale and the wings come up as 1.2lbs. I called and asked if there had been some sort of mistake, I was told that the wings can lose up to 50% of the weight from cooking and that the 2lbs advertisement was for the weight of the chicken pre-cooked.

so I guess I was lucky I didn't get 1lb from my 2lb order?

Will never order from them again, will avoid like a plague..."}
{"text":"Quick one because it's not really worth it...

- immature staff with zero customer service skills
- staff friends hanging around in the store being obnoxious
- way over priced, $35 for 2 pounds of wings and 2 drinks 
- they charge a dollar per SMALL blue cheese dipping sauce - huh?
- wings mediocre and under seasoned

Won't be back unfortunately."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge wings fan, but these are quite delicious! The swamp sauce is great!  They can also use halal chicken if you observe Islamic dietary laws which is awesome!  Can make orders for pick up and they're always ready right in time and are nice and fresh."}
{"text":"Ordered a pound of wings, and a small wedges. The wings are very good. However my wedges were saturated in salt.  When I called to ask for a new order of wedges, I was told the manager would call me back. No one did. Showing a complete lack of customer care. I won't be returning.  Also the wedges order was very small, as in barely any.

This happened at the south down location."}
{"text":"Searching for the best wings in Oakville is like searching for the little man in the boat on a skinny girl, it's not always easy, but once you've found it you just wanna keep going back. 

It was with this attitude that led me to The Wingery on Sixth Line. Tucked away in a forgettable strip mall that notably includes Mario's Pizza, home of the $5 piece of shit pizza. Luckily for wing lovers, there is no terrible food curse on this strip mall. 

The wings are plump but not super juicy. They are heavily breaded, buffalo styles and coated with a barely adequate covering of your choice of 20 different sauces. I've only tried a few of the options thus far by as of now, I'd say Hot Honey takes the cake. If you like saucy wings, you'll likely want to (well you won't WANT to) spend the 35-70 cents extra (35 for sloppy, 70 for dripping). Another annoying extra change is the $1.85 extra for splitting sauces in less than 2 lb increments. 

Believe it or not, but the best thing on the menu is NOT the wings. Though they are certainly very good, if not great, The Wingery's top item is the Sloppy Chicken Sandwich. A massive chunk of white meat chicken breast, breaded like the wings and rolled in one of your favourite sauces this is a simple but tremendously effective sandwich. It's big, crunchy and tasty as shit. Do it. 

Also of note is the Wingery Three Wrap, a trio of small chicken wraps with lettuce, cheese and either ranch, blue cheese, creamy garlic or any one of the wing sauces. The key thing here is you can mix up your sauces on these. A great way to get introduced to the 20 flavours.  

All in all, it's a tasty sandwich, which is why my rating is so high. The wings are certainly good, probably the biggest wings in Oakville. However, the extra sauce charges and lack of flexibility take them down a page in my book. But really, that sandwich is very good. You know, for Oakville."}
{"text":"Tiny wings, and despite this they don't give enough sauce to cover the tiny wings. 

Want more sauce? No problem, pay up. 

Want delivery? No problem, it'll show up next week. 

Hope you're not hungry. Hope you're not expecting warm food. Hope you don't like crunchy fries. 

What a total rip off! I bet somebody there is sitting around plotting how they can make you suffer more.

Addendum: yess!!! The creepy man does say really strange and awkward things too! What a creepo!"}
{"text":"Stopped by because of another yelp review. Wings were above par and I liked the sauce selection. Nice to have craft beer on tap and bottle. Shouldn't be in a chilled glass though. Wish I has a place like this near me."}
{"text":"This is a hard review .
Let me start by saying I love wings will drive far just to have wings .
My number one wings are Duffs in Toronto and the Anchor Bar . The one in Buffalo. 
Let me tell you what I think about these wings then .
They are big that's a great thing but they are breaded .
WHY ...... it could of been a great wing  .
We also ordered  hot and they tasted like a light mild .
Not really a buffalo sauce more like a bbq .
We had some fries and they were great ."}
{"text":"SOOOO good!!! Went there with a colleague for lunch. We wanted to try something different. We had never been here before and we just went in to look at the menu. The gentleman who cooks was at the front and we spoke and the young lady came after and she assisted us with our order and even recommended the special!! CAN I JSUT SAY AMAZING!!! I have been there 3 times now and it is soo good!! Sauce is great, chicken fingers great, potato wedges great, perogies great!! AMAZING!! And such great prices!! Definitely recommend this place. Excellent food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Ever since the old owners sold and it franchised it's just not the same. Delivery order I just placed has taken over 90 minutes so far and still not arrived. When I called to check on the status they seemed like they could care less that it was double the time they said it would arrive in. They regularly mess up orders, like requesting well done and getting wings that are barely adequately cooked let alone well done. The last batch had Sauve just randomly squirted on them in the box. 

The standards are not what they once were. It's probably time to look at other choices for wings these days."}
{"text":"Terrible service.... Anyone picking up their Super Bowl order probably felt the same way.  The owner took too many orders, got flustered and started filling orders based on who was threatening to cancel their order or demanding a refund.  

To make matters worst, the owner starts yelling back at the customers after a number that they were waiting 2+ hours and the game is starting soon.  Yes, the owner of a wing store was complaining that he was too busy on Super Bowl Sunday.

Anyhow, my order was completely wrong, ended up missing the first two quarters and after a two hour wait the owner tells me he put extra sauce (which didn't want) on the wings as a courtesy.

What a complete mess... the wings were decent but definitely not worth the headache.  Safe to say, I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"The wings are amazing and the swamp sauce is fantastic. I order from the place once a week and they always have great deals"}
{"text":"I never thought I'd actually find wings I didn't like. 

Alas, The Wingery will be known as that, to me. 

I would give them 3 stars, but I really can't justify 3 stars just because of its size. 
Yes, they're big. Size matters, but you always gotta know how to use it. Right? 

What's the point of getting sauce wings over dry flavours, when they're all dry? 

We ordered the 'Monday/Tuesday 3lb special' w/ Peruvian, Swamp sauce, and dry Cajun. Literally every single wing was dry. 
Looked and tasted like they pre-made a bunch of flavours & reheated them. Maybe this is what they do on the 'special' days?
We were told the wings would be ready for pick up in 15. Within those 15 minutes we come by, and our wings are cold? Nope. Nope. This is not actually happening. What?

The dry Cajun was good, on the parts of the wing that actually had seasoning. Other than that, it was just your run of the mill fried chicken, with no season. Not even salt. 
The Peruvian kick tasted like nothing. With the exception of a very, very mild kick at the end. 
Swamp sauce was the only bearable wings we had. I mean, you can't really screw up buffalo sauce. Then again, it tasted like someone took the wings and wiped off all the sauce..

We were super excited about trying this place, because of all the good reviews. Who knew it would end up such a disappointment. 
Hope their standards aren't dropping already. But I don't believe we will be returning."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from here from here for several years and have never had an issue. 
The food was absolutely disgusting. Initially told us that lettuce for burger unavailable  do to busyness on day prior.  Chicken fingers were a patty that was cut in half. Chicken burger black. Wings inedible. A complete waste of money. Clearly under new management.  Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend for lunch today; I ordered the chicken sandwitch lunch box meal with perogies and a pop. The chicken sandwitch was satisfactory with the hot sauce. The perogies were exceptionally good, and something I will be going back for. This is your basic take out place with a few chairs, and the have delivery. This is apparently one of a chain of several locations. I need to try the wings. Overall, for what it is, I would give it 4/5 stars.  Nothing special, but good to go."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! Staff is awesome, friendly, & DRAMA free. As of late spring / early summer 2013 ...this place has definitely made some changes...for the better! The menu is great with more options (fried Mac n cheese & poppers are my fav. appetizers!) The beer selection is getting better and not to mention $1 beers on Wednesdays! Can't beat that!!

The outside patio area occasionally has some music & is just a great addition to the restaurant! The owner is definitely keeping JT Walker's, down the street, on their toes!! 

So if you are passing through mahomet & are looking for a great place to eat I would definitely recommend the wingery! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I always go on Monday or Tuesday and do the 3LBS special and it's worth it. Nice and saucy, big wings."}
{"text":"I tried non breaded 1 pound Buffalo flavored wings and must say they are good,not the best but good. The quantity is ok. For 1 pound wings you will get 7 pieces. I will recommend the place"}
{"text":"This will be a short review. To sum it up, these are Pricey wings. 

They give you a good amount of meat on them, but I still don't feel that it's worth the price. The service was fine, and my only complaint is how expensive these wings are! 

Overall, I will be back, but not as often as I'd like because wings are a common dish in many restaurants, and usually at a much cheaper price tag!"}
{"text":"Tried this a while back, got the fried chicken sandwich and it was meh. It was pretty small and lacked the spices and flavors I was expecting in a chicken sandwich. It's nothing special. In my opinion, Mary Browns and KFC's chicken sandwiches are better.

It took SUPER long to get 1 sandwich, there was no one even in the store and it was about 7pm. Took a good 15-20 minutes for the sandwich, no combo. The cashier was on her phone the whole time too, not really updating me about my order."}
{"text":"Super friendly service. Bun on our sandwiches we very fresh and flavourful. Chicken was moist and juicy, and the marinara wasn't over the top which was excellent. I love wedges, so that was a nice addition to the meal. Excellent price points too. 

All in all, great little place. Very happy we picked it off yelp as we aren't local. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Worst place I ever been too...gave me stale wings or something cause I got really sick after I ate it...never coming back here again I rather go to another wing spot near by"}
{"text":"All the other Wingery locations I have tried in the past have been nothing but exceptional.. It's quite unfortunate that the Aurora location offers less than sub-par customer service. 

I ordered 2lbs of wings from this location once. One pound plain and the other pound in honey garlic sauce. I essentially paid $27 dollars and tipped them $3, even though I came in to pick it up. It did not occur to me that I should've double checked my order and open the box right then and there as I have never had a problem before.

When I got home and opened the takeout box.. There were only 10 wings in total. As I have worked in the restaurant business for a while, I called back and knew that there was absolutely no way that 2 lbs of wings were equivalent to 10 wings (also taking into consideration that the wings at the wingery are larger than \"normal\").

However, I have frequently ordered 2lbs of wings from different locations (primarily in Guelph and Woodbridge locations) and NOT once have I ever recieved only 10 wings in total. 

I told them I was willing to drive back to show them the untouched order. The worker on the phone kept trying to argue that 1 lb was equivalent to 4-6 wings. 

Now, unless this was my first time ordering and I had no idea what 1 lb of wings looked like, I would have believed them. However, they kept insisting that the wings were weighed prior to being fried and sounded as if I were trying to cheat them for more wings.

Unless the wings had an extra pound of water weight prior to frying, they weren't fooling anyone. I didn't try to argue any further as it was late and I was hungry (and quite annoyed at this point).

I still order from the other locations, however the Aurora branch has definitely lost my vote. This location is in dire need of some sort of management intervention / needs to provide their staff with a lot more work training. Overall, thoroughly unimpressed."}
{"text":"The Wingery is the only place I will ever go to if I'm ever craving wings in the GTA. Though their prices may be considered expensive to some people (in comparison to Pizza Hut, Dominos / Pizza Pizza's crappy wings), the quality and friendly service you're getting here is definitely worth it (save for the Aurora branch). Hell, I even tip a few bucks every time I order and pick up because I love this place so much.

I haven't gotten around to rating and leaving a review for this place until now but this is a great place especially for when I get off work late on the weekends. If you want fresh, juicy and great tasting wings, look no further. This place has got you covered."}
{"text":"When I crave wings this is my must go to place.  Nothing else in Oakville comes close!  Tried the new Buffalo Wild Wing on Dundas and Winston Park and they can't touch these wings!  Dry Cajun and Hot is the perfect duo.  Carribean is also good.  Try it !!!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying out this restaurant for dinner over the Canada Day holiday weekend. I had the Supreme Sloppy Chicken sandwich combo with Caesar salad for the side. BF opted for a 1/2 lb wing combo with fries. The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful with choosing the sauce from the dozen-plus choices. The sandwich requires 15 minutes to prepare for some reason but we were planning to sit and stay for eat-in anyway and they asked whether we wanted our meals served simultaneously so that was all good. 

The tables and chairs are your very basic, moveable stuff that doesn't let you forget it's still just a fast food joint in spite of the \"next level\" quality of the premium \"fast\" food. It was clean though and not a harshly lit atmosphere so also fine on that score. 

The food itself was okay - the sandwich comes on a bun which is actually a garlic bread bun where you have the garlic salt and dried parsley flakes on the inside of it. The chicken fillet was a good size and blessedly moist. The cheese definitely was not as voluminous and oozy sloppy as the photo, I had to open it up and take it apart to make sure it was there, barely covering the bottom of the bun under the chicken. I'm glad I didn't ask for extra sauce cuz it was already a little overpowering to be able to taste the rest of the sandwich. Said sauce was the Thai sauce which tasted like typical fast food chain, commercially prepared stuff. It also comes with an onion ring (yes one very large one cut in half) and bacon, which was properly cooked, and well it's bacon what's not to love since it wasn't dried out! 

The salad, however, was seriously disappointing, enough to bring it down to 2.5 stars. Absolutely the nastiest excuses for croutons ever served in a public place. Stale, dry, disgusting! They'd have done better to say, sorry, we're out of croutons, and save the salad.

The 1/2 lb worth of wings was 4 HUGE wings, which were reportedly pretty good, and worthy of a specialty wing place as compared to the side grade wings at pizzerias. The fries are the typical mass-produced, commercial grade potato wedges. Definitely not much better than the same mass-produced, commercial grade potato wedges at the Pizza Pizza next door.

All in all, a decent experience, mostly due to the good staff (including a competent chef who prepares the chicken properly), but lots of room for improvement with everything else besides the chicken. I'd recommend a better bun and crouton supplier first and foremost. If I wanted a sandwich and salad with that level of quality, I'd skip the premium price and go to the supermarket to buy a frozen garlic bread and expired box of croutons. Real shame to use that on such properly cooked and tasty chicken! The sauces are also impressive in terms of the array you have to choose from, but even those weren't particularly noteworthy and again, just tasted like they came out of bottles you can get at the supermarket.

If someone else insisted on coming here to try it, I'd eat here again, but I'd try another place rather than make another visit here specifically."}
{"text":"XL sized chicken wings generously breaded and fried to crispy perfection. I've never heard a wing pop and crackle so much as I bit into it as these. I used to order my wings sauced, but was recently shown a better way by a friend to order your wings dry with the sauce on the side. This way you can sauce them to your own pace and not be worrying that your last couple wings at the bottom are going to be soggy and lack that charismatic crunch. I've been doing this for a while now and know and is the best way I've eaten wings. It also allows the wing to shine and let the taste buds appreciate the wing itself and not be biased by any extra notes of salt or sugar from the sauce.  
The Wingery's wings had a lot going on. For one, the wing size was far bigger than any other wings I've had from any other location. The batter was super crispy and surprisingly flavorful. It had enough saltiness in the wing itself, I had eaten 2/3rds of the box just dry before using any sauce. Even than I only caved so that I could talk about the sauce in this review. I could have and would have eaten those wings dry otherwise and been perfectly satisfied. But I sauced for the sake of the readers, and boy am I glad I did. Now I've come to terms with my terrible tolerance for heat after eating a scotch bonnet one time in the past. I became less ambitious as a heat seeker after that day. Yet out of the 20+ sauces The Wingery had to offer me that evening, I somehow had undertaken their ugly sauce. I suppose that's what happens when they ask you what sauce you want and you blurt out, \"Surprise me\". Well, the ugly sauce wasn't that bad. It was actually really fucking good. It had enough heat for me to handle but man it had flavor more than anything. Would definitely recommend it if you aren't totally incapable of handling some heat.
 
Read the full review on my blog! (Link in profile)
Leave me a comment and a recommendation while you're there!"}
{"text":"Great wings! Most mild sauce I've ever had! It was messy but worth it! My two kids got their grubby fingers all over my new upholstery, so I grounded them, but I still enjoyed the wings."}
{"text":"Strange experience - thought I was going to have to break up fight between a patron and 'the odd guy'. Place seems totally chaotic. That said - my wings were pretty good!"}
{"text":"My visit to The Wingery was long overdue as I've been meaning to check it out since it opened a few months ago. Wasn't really feeling wings so I walked in, fingers crossed that they would have chicken sandwiches of some sort.

They had a handful of sandwiches to choose from, but the one that caught my eye was their standard sandwich, the Sloppy Chicken. This sandwich was incredibly simple - a breaded chicken breast covered with a wing sauce of your choice. Upon recommendation, I tried out the hot honey barbecue flavour. 

-----
Wait time: 15 minutes
-----

I received my sandwich. Yup, it was sloppy alright. The foil used to wrap the sandwich was covered in sauce. Not to worry, the staff expected this and had already provided napkins and moist towelettes.

First bite in, and I was amazed. There was no dryness that you'd characteristically associate with chicken breast - the meat basically fell apart as you bit it as if it were fish. The hot honey barbecue sauce was a great recommendation - very flavourful. 

The sandwich itself was a testament to how much confidence they had in their chicken. With no accompaniments other than sauce and a bun, they'd need to believe that their chicken was good enough to sell as a sandwich on its own. Without a doubt, the answer is yes. 

I really liked the concept of how the same sloppy chicken sandwich could have nearly 20 different tastes depending on the sauce you chose. Can't wait to try a new flavour on my next visit."}
{"text":"great wings,,, loved how big they are and buy them by the pound. Can't say when it comes to taste they are the best but filling and leaves you satisfied. Only con was this place is only take-out and delivery so had to eat in the car and was winter. 

Monday and Tuesday 3 pounds for just under $23."}
{"text":"Going over some reviews it seems there are similar complaints regarding the sauce and I would have to agree that is my issue as well. Had high expectations for this place but somewhat disappointed. Good size but the sauce was lacking. Flavour wise it seems to be there but just not enough of it."}
{"text":"Small little place in a plaza off Kennedy and Eglington. The place itself couldn't possibly hold more than 8 people, so mainly a takeout spot. The menu is focused around chicken wings and some sandwiches. Oddly enough, they have items like poutine, mac and cheese bites, and pierogies as well. 

The sloppy Chicken sandwich is a breaded chicken sandwich, tossed in wing sauce and sounded too good to pass up. Also got a lunch box of half pound of wings and pierogies because I'm fat. The chicken sandwich wasn't very good though as the meat slid in and around the breading. Halfway through the sandwich, the meat inside actually slid out of the breading, so it was pretty messy (partly because I got it for takeout as well). 

The wings are a different story. The wings are enormous. Half pound wings equated to about 4 wings that looked like they came off a chicken that went through a bodybuilding stage. The skin was crisp and the meat was juicy. Pierogies were pretty decent too. Just your standard buttery cheesy potatoey pierogy, and served with a side of sour cream.

Definitely worth it for a lunch box as you can choose a meal, side, and drink for $6.99. Dipping sauce need to be ordered separately though. They have a variety of wing sauces for you to choose from as well."}
{"text":"I've tried this place a few times to check out their different flavours of wings. Not much of a dining area, but great for takeout. You can order anything from a half pound to five pounds at reasonable prices. They have everything from mild BBQ up to some super hot varieties, probably about 30 choices altogether. One time, I ordered a pound of Diablos Cocktail wings just to see how hot it was. It was so hot that I had a burning sensation when it came out the other end..."}
{"text":"The Wingery Woodbridge! I don't think there's a better place to get wings in a 10km radius. My favourite flavour is Arsonist's Pride, a good classic taste that balances the heat with the salt/vinegar properly. Try them out!"}
{"text":"This location used to be amazing, but has switched ownership. Since the switch I have ordered twice and both times has issues where the wings seemed under cooked, the batter mushy, and barely any sauce of seasoning on the wings. The dry cajun only had a light dusting of spice on one side like they just sprinkled some after placing the wings in the box instead of tossing them in the spice like they used to. Really went down hill in the last six months. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The wings here are phenomenal. Been a fan since they only had one store on 6th line oakville. Im upset that their prices went up, but its still. For those who arent looking to get messy while eating, try their boneless chicken."}
{"text":"The biggest scam when it comes to eating your money. The amount you're paying for their food items does NOT reach up to expectations."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try this place out since it's in my neck of the woods. It was surprisingly great! The lady at the cash, Paige, was very helpful and pleasant to talk to. This place is geared towards take out only but they do have a few chairs if you'd like to eat and run. 

I ordered their lunch special: 1/2 pound of wings, side order of sweet potato fries and they had a Thursday special of 10 perogies for $5! The wings are a good size and were nice and crispy on the outside. I sauced them in hot honey bbq (I think it was called)... Really good! My vegetarian sister had the perogies with sour cream which were amazing and a great value. We shared a small sweet potato fry side order... It was super small and not worth it in my opinion. The fries were crispy and hot...The chipotle mayo that came with it was yummy I just wish their sizes were a little larger. Other than that it was a great experience. 

While I was waiting for my order I overheard 10 other people behind me in line order the \"sloppy chicken sandwich\"... I'll definitely try that next time!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I really had to try The Wingery out. Right after work I called in to place my order. It took about 20 minutes for my order to be completed. I got the dinner combo A for two with Cajun and swamp sauce wings.

The wings were a good size and tasted delicious naked! I also like how they weigh the wings to exactly what I ordered. The wedge fries were nothing special. I didn't care because I was interested in eating their wings. The dinner combo was $28 and change.

There is limited seating as they are more of a take-out shop. I'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"good portion for the price. really good breading but i felt the inside of the wings was under-seasoned. beware this is not a sit-down place and it's takeout only. lots of flavours to choose from for wings but know that when they say hot they mean HOT...so use your discretion when ordering!"}
{"text":"went because a coupon came in mailbox.New location in Vaughan, owner was on site and made sure things were done well. Giant Wings, great flavors too.  I could see the chef in kitchen making things, also ordered fries and they were good!  Very friendly, attentive staff.  Two televisions on the wall and will take requests for particular channels.  Feels like home.  Asked how we liked the food, and gave us free dessert samples (nutella stuffed) 
 ~only reason I withheld fifth star, no free refills~"}
{"text":"As many have mentioned, this location has gone significantly downhill since new management. The comments of the owner are odd and offensive. I'm my specific example I did an online order (knowing the service has become super slow), upon getting there, the owner said that the sauce that I ordered was unavailable and hadn't made yet. When I asked why didn't he contact me on my cell (given at time of online order) he rudely commented about \"what's my problem\" and said he would make the order quickly. 20 minutes later, he had not gotten back to the counter. I called out to him as he came back to me, asking if I had a bad day, because I looked like I had a bad day. 25 minutes after I entered (and now going on an hour since I ordered) my wings were ready. NEVER AGAIN!!"}
{"text":"After three visits, I can finally say that both the food and service are top notch. I've only had the wings and fried macaroni bites, but I've enjoyed them every time. The wings were large and cooked well. The flavours I've tried were honey garlic, BBQ and honey mustard. It's a small, clean spot with a few tables for dining in. I recommend it if you're in the mood for wings."}
{"text":"the Lunch box (offered from 11-3pm)
is the best deal! 2 items + 1 pop for $7.90 including taxes!

got 1/2 lb (4pcs) of ARSONIST'S PRIDE wings (spicy-level3) plus 4 perogies, with sour cream dip!

Their wings are huge! and hot!
just perfect for my liking.

flavoured to perfection.
wait time: around 10-15mins

But call in to order for pick up so you dont have to wait ;)"}
{"text":"*DISCLAIMER*
I DID NOT ACTUALLY EAT HERE

So I had this place bookmarked for a while. I was finally in the area and craving wings. so we decided to call ahead to order on our way to the restaurant.
I order 2lbs of wings and a order of wedges. 
I was told order would be ready in 45mins disappointing but whatever, then she proceeds to give me this speech about how they raised there prices and blaah blahh
So I ask whats my total as I'm suspicious of this speech, shes just clearly reiterated all day.
46 and change. Who What and Why
I asked how many wings come in a pound, she says 7
so 14 wings and some wedges will cost me almost 50$
How did they come up with this number?
I told her thanks for her time and deleted this from my bookmarks

But on the plus side, customer service seems on point.
she was extremely friendly and umm informative :)"}
{"text":"Months ago, I bought a Groupon to get $20 of food, with the option to either dine in or do takeout. Well, I received a notification saying that my Groupon was about expire. I decided to use it before it was too late.

The Wingery is located in the same plaza as Wimpy's Diner, which I love visiting whenever I am at the Cineplex or hungry in Aurora. 

I parked. The lot competes with many businesses, including Goodlife Fitness, but I didn't have any issues with finding a spot. There are plenty!

I walked in. No one was manning the register. There was one guy in the kitchen. After waiting for at least five minutes, he came over and apologized for making me wait. The cashier was away on break. As he said that to me, she magically appeared.

It's a good thing that I am patient. Otherwise, I would have walked out. However, it's best that I stay to use my Groupon!

I ordered 1.5 pounds of wings in honey garlic. They cost $17.99, which can be perceived as being on the expensive side. I also ordered six pieces of the mac and cheese bites. They go for $5.99. I had to. I love mac and cheese.

She scanned my Groupon barcode with her iPad. I paid the difference, which was $4.50. She advised that it would take about five minutes.

I sat down at one of the tables. There was an HD TV with Rogers programming. I got to preview Labyrinth and thought about how lucky I was to see David Bowie in concert once.

The seats are kind of small. They kind of reminded me of being in kindergarten! The tables are decent. I felt like an adult.

The motto here is \"size matters.\" The wings are indeed larger than what I am accustomed to when it comes to bone-in wings.

I loved the honey garlic sauce. Lots of chopped garlic was present. The sauce was perfect. The wings were both crunchy and juicy. Yum!

The mac and cheese bites were amazing. Light, crispy batter coated the cheesy mac and cheese. So good! 

I am so glad that this Groupon introduced me to place. I would definitely come back and order food from this eatery again.

{"text":"Pretty good!
We stopped here on a Friday night because we wanted wings and saw a couple of great reviews on Yelp.
It's pretty close to home, otherwise I'm not sure if we would've made the trek to try it out. There's very little seating, and as mentioned in other reviews, most people seem to just order take out.
The wait for our food was about 20 minutes, so I will definitely look at their online menu and call ahead to order next time.
We got the Dinner for a Two (A), which consisted of 2 lbs of wings, two drinks, and large potato wedges for 24.99.
You get one flavour/sauce per pound, so we got the Hot Honey BBQ and the Dry Cajun. They were both pretty good - the Hot Honey had two hot peppers beside it, but I couldn't really feel the heat and will probably try something spicier next time. The Dry Cajun (1 hot pepper rating) had a nice blend of spices and a good amount of salt. I really liked the breading on the Cajun, although I'd like if there was an option of traditional non-breaded wings, especially for the saucier wings (just my preference, don't hate).
The potatoes were very...potato-y. I wish they were a bit crispier on the outside and softer in the middle. I'd probably also enjoy them with the Cajun spices they used on the wings - yum! Overall, a 3/5 on the potatoes.
The prices were a bit high, but I think it was worth the quality of food we have received, especially compared to other joints in the area. I know they have some deals on weeknights which would make it more reasonable.
Overall, the wings were bomb (5/5), potatoes were average (3/5). I will visit again for the wings and perhaps try the perogies."}
{"text":"SIZE MATTERS. 

If you were going to grab just wings, I can't imagine why you wouldn't grab them from The Wingery. Whenever I'm in the area, I make sure to grab wings from Oakville, Burlington, or these new Mississauga locations. 

Just a warning to those looking for a sit down place: this is more of an order and take to go joint. This location has a few tables so that's a huge plus. 

Moving onto the food: the wings are huge and the breading is great. They have a variety of sauces to choose from. I've tried Peruvian kick, arsonists pride, desert heat, snake venom, and gates of hell. Arsonists pride is definitely my favourite with the spicy flavourful combination. I've also tried their chicken burger, perogies, and their fries. All of these are also solid choices, but why not get the wings!?

They've recently introduced the lunch combo box which is fantastic! Two items and a drink for $7.90 (after taxes). Take a chance and try this place out - you won't regret it. 

WARNING: snake venom BURNS. it is their spiciest sauce and I was overconfident in my spice tolerance. I ate half a wing and called it quits. I had to pull over to a gas station to down 1L of water.

Note: I got extra wings just because it was a long wait. They're great!"}
{"text":"This was a joke. Does not measure up to other restaurants of same brand. 

Waited 80 minutes just for 1 pound of wings, 1 order of Mozza sticks, and one small macaroni salad to make it to my hotel, and then it turns out the delivery guy went to the wrong hotel (he says at the direction of the manager). Guy calls a few times and gets no answer from me.  Since it was taking so long I guess I went to take a dump and forgot my phone. 30 minutes later I call and the guy blames me. I then said ok well I still want the order. Another 40 minutes later I get a call from the manager that his guy should be at my room. I'm standing outside my room telling him there is nobody here. Order placed over 2 hours ago at this point. Finally they manage to work out that the guy is at the wrong hotel. Shows up with barely warm food. After I pay I realize the macaroni salad has no fork to eat it with and the mozzarella sticks did not come with marinara sauce. Such a joke. I've ordered multiple times from my local Wingery location in Mississauga and never even had a small complaint. This one order today must have had 5 different screw ups!"}
{"text":"After reading all of the other reviews, I was anticipating trying this place out.

I placed an online order to be delivered some 90 minutes later. 100 minutes later, the order had not arrived. I called the restaurant, only to be placed on hold 3 separate times. The person tells me that there was a mix up in the kitchen and that they can get the order out to me in 30 minutes. In two hours, I could have killed, seasoned and fried my own chicken.

No sincere apology or discount offered. He acted like I was in the wrong for calling bothering him. Needless to say, I cancelled the order and went elsewhere. I will share the experience of their horrible non customer service with any and everyone I meet.

DINE ELSEWHERE!!

You won't get your food here!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like a nice pound of wings? I certainly do. And that's exactly what I got at this new wing joint. The Wingery is mostly catered towards take-out customers, but there are a couple chairs and tables there if you want to just scarf your food down quick. Their menu consists of wings, sandwiches and some apps. I ordered a 1.5 pounds of the Hot Honey BBQ wings and their deep fried pickles as an app. Service was prompt. The app and the wings were made fresh as they were both piping hot when I got them. The wings are HUGE! Definitely larger than most wing places. But the big surprise was the deep fried pickles. served with Ranch sauce, they were surprisingly delicious. 

I don't think I could recommend a better place to get food for an at-home get-together. I'll be back again soon... maybe going to give their sandwiches a try next time :)"}
{"text":"Came here based on recommendations from some coworkers. We ordered the 2lb combo that came with wedges and pop. The wings were okay but not the greatest - it could've used more sauce and they were soft when we got home. We didn't want to eat there because the store is so tiny, but if you like your wings hot and crisp, it's probably best that you do. The wedges were okay as well - same issue with it being soft when we got it. The price is good for the amount that you get, and the wings are pretty big too.

The worker was super nice and friendly though which is enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"The Wingery just opened in Aurora last month. I love wings and had high hopes for this franchise. I walked up to the counter and advised I had a coupon. The kid behind the counter walks away without a word and asks another kid in the kitchen to take over.  It was a \"2 can dine for $20\" coupon.  Regular price is $25.99. When he rung me up, I blindly tapped my credit card without checking the amount. After the transaction went through, I realized I was charged $29.49 instead of what should have been $22.60. When I advised of the error, I was told I took the discount off, it's correct. So.. I'm paying $9.59 in taxes for a $20 meal?!? No, that's not right! I think you forgot to take the discount off, I told him. Once again, I was advised \"I don't know what to tell you. I took the discount off. It's correct. There's nothing I can do now.\"  What horrible customer service! I would have asked for a refund if I thought he knew how to do it. At that point, I was hoping the wings would blow me away. I took my order home and opened the box. Umm, wings? What wings? I got 2 wings and a bunch of drumsticks. The flavour was just ok but the wings were too heavily breaded. The large fries included in the meal came in a 3x3x6\" box. It should have been called a small. I'll stick with St. Louis wings."}
{"text":"The Wingery has the best wings of any bar or restaurant in Oakville and I can say now it is the best managed establishment I have ever been too. 

There was a very minor problem with my order today and the management wanted to take the time to make sure I was happy with my order and that they made the situation right. I didn't complain or think about complaining because the mix up was so minor. 

Knowing that a place is run by people that have those types of standards for themselves is unlike anything I ever experience when dining out ever. 

Wingery is a place I will continue to go to often, they have amazing quality food, delicious sauces, diverse menu, and the classiest management of any restaurant I have ever been to in Oakville."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 pounds and a bottle of pop with a coupon came to just under $30. Normally would think it's expensive but the quality was spot on. Very happy with my order.

I got 3 different flavours. Arsonist's Pride, Diablo's Cocktail and Teriyaki. I enjoyed all 3 flavours though wish I went a bit hotter with my choices. With it being my first time I wasn't to sure of how hot to go and didn't want to waste a lb of wings going to hot. In comparison I would say if you like sirachi on food Diablo's is just around that in terms of the after heat. AP was flavourful and I enjoyed them not as much heat as I was expecting but again first time so wasn't to sure on the ratings. I went with the teriyaki as a cool down wing. Pretty straight forward flavours next time I think I would get them with extra sauce as it's thinner it runs a bit so didn't coat all the wing as well but very minor imo still tasted great the chicken was cooked well and didn't have that frozen texture to the meat you get at the bigger pizza chain wings. 

I also took the advice of someone else on here and opened the front flap of my box a bit for my drive home (about 10 mins) the heat was pouring out but they stayed really crispy and we're still hot when I got home to start eating them.

All being said friendly staff quick service (called for pick up was ready in 20 minutes) and great food I will definitely be going back and working my way up through the different heats on the flavour chart."}
{"text":"This place has amazing wings and some very spicy flavors, if you don't mind burning your mouth and suffering for two or three days after you eat wings! But really, the Snake Venom is I think their hottest sauce but it's double the heat that I can stand. Wednesday's sloppy chicken sandwich is a good deal (and a delicious sandwich) and Mondays we've got the wings special before: 3 lbs for the price of 2. Delicious. Also, try their dry rub: Dessert Heat. 
The guys and ladies that work here are always nice. The only thing missing would be better seating, but I think that's in the works! 
Great place though, I recommend it! And, they also deliver!"}
{"text":"I can't fathom why anyone who has tried the Wingery wings would ever choose to go to another place specifically for wings.

Yes, I live down the street from them, but I'm also walking distance to another wing place (self-proclaimed 'Best in Oakville') and a short drive to a large wing franchise. 

When the Wingery first opened, I wondered how they could make a go in a C-class strip mall with a pizza place that sold wings and a bar that had some decent wings, but from the moment I took the first bite, I knew they were not just the best in the area, but the best I ever tasted.

The wings are huge, the chicken is moist, the bite is crisp and all the sauces I've tried (from a Mild BBQ, to Swamp Sauce to Gates of Hell) all pop with textured flavours -- even Gates from Hell, which was a fight between the pain from heat and the desire to taste the sauce again.

Foodies and wing fans -- if you don't even try this place, you're a damn fool."}
{"text":"Amazing wings , great service.
This place has quickly become one of my favorites spot when I visit Ontario. I came all the way from Miami and was not disappointed"}
