{"text":"Really awesome sausage sandwiches and mango smoothies. My kids loved their donuts too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I go to this location all the time, and they're always very kind and patient.  The donuts are among the best I've ever had, and the sandwiches and burritos are supreme, as well. Will be a customer of this location for a very long time, and I'll be reccommending it to everyone that wants good service and a great donut, too."}
{"text":"Excellent variety. Donuts are their main food but they also have great sandwiches and breakfast burritos at an excellent price!! Very tasty."}
{"text":"I love this Rainbow Donuts location. Don't confuse it with some of the other Rainbows around town. It's exceptional. The staff is so friendly and the menu is quite diverse for a donut shop. 

The breakfast special, a breakfast croissant, donut and coffee, is my order of choice. All wonderful, The granddaughters love the donut selections and the Labradoodle enjoys the patio. The husband often orders scrambled eggs a la carte when he's doing his high protein diet thing. The coffee station is well stocked with a variety of syrups... so you can precisely tailor your coffee to your cravings.

The dining room and restroom are always spotless. Service is always fast, even if there's a line, which there often is on the weekends. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast burritos and donuts! Very reasonable and fast breakfast that taste great!  Try the Red Velvet donuts, they are the best we ever had!"}
{"text":"The only thing better than Rainbow's doughnuts are the incredible staff. We dropped by late Sunday afternoon (mother's day) and selection was pretty sparse however, this is to be expected since it was late in the afternoon on Mother's Day. The woman who served us was so welcoming and apologetic about the selection which was completely unnecessary as the doughnuts that we ended up with were phenomenal (crème brûlé, red velvet and strawberry). Prices are fantastic, doughnuts are even better."}
{"text":"Delish!! Best donuts in town!! Blows dunkin donuts away!! Big selection of donuts and the best part is they are so moist!!!"}
{"text":"awesome spot! they have the best donuts in town, and all their food is made to order. the sandwiches are really good too."}
{"text":"Awesome donuts. Read the yelp reviews and they were right on the dot! However, despite negative reviews, The coffee is great! It's not Starbucks or Dutch Brothers BUT it's great coffee house type coffee. Definitely worth the drive past Dunkin' Donuts."}
{"text":"Best doughnuts in AZ! Super fresh, light, and fluffy. No other doughnut shop comes even close. Plus, they are very friendly and have great customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious amazing perfect doughnuts! Also very impressed with their bagel sandwiches which are super fresh and the bagels are to die for not preservative filled heaviness but light, tasty, mouthwatering.... Hard to find with bagels!!

We came here twice from California while visiting fam. Staff is super friendly and customer service is great. Highly recommended. Happy they exist!"}
{"text":"Another great donut spot! The owners/management is by far one of the friendliest I have met. The donuts are consistently good and it's my go to for quick, easy, and tasty donuts. I only gave it a 4 because I'm picky and wished they offered a cronut since I think they could nail it.  I would honestly give it a 4.5 but that option isn't on here. Always come back here!"}
{"text":"The freshest donuts and yummiest sandwiches. The prices are low and the quality is great! I've brought multiple boxes of donuts to my work and everyone loves it. My coworkers always ask \"are those from Rainbow???\" Besides the killer donuts, I love their breakfast sandwiches and Thai tea. The best service and friendliest staff on top of great food, you can't go wrong! These are the neighborhood businesses I love to support. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"All I'm going to say is: YES!!!!!!!!!!

Best donuts! Best iced Thai Tea (or have it as a smoothie)! Best service! So friendly! The food is oh-so-yummy! Best smoothies and frappes! The prices are 
oh-so-right! My new favorite place! 

This place is a little piece of heaven! You must go! If you're looking for the best old school, (and they have some cool modern Flavors as well) always fresh, yummy donuts, you must come here! If you are a smoothie, or frappe, and iced drinks (coffees, Thai tea, etc) addict, you need to try this place! You will love it! Also--like I said, their food is so good!"}
{"text":"The donuts here are so fresh! It's such a treat when go. My favorite is the the orange glazed one, it's lightly done and not overpowering! A-mazing!"}
{"text":"We just moved into the area and decided to try the local donut shop. The donuts were tasty and a reasonable side. My Boston cream was okay, but the cream was pretty biased to one side, so it loses a couple points. Verdict: a decent place, but it won't replace our valley favorite of Bosa Donuts."}
{"text":"THE BEST IN PHOENX and they've added a \"made to order\" breakfast croissant that is absolute perfection. We are regulars at the Cave Creek store who also have a drive thru.  They even have outside tables although the street is not a place you want to linger. The staff is always very pleasant."}
{"text":"I could eat a doughnut for every meal of every day yet I still haven't tried any of Rainbows doughnuts yet, because the rest of their menu is TOO GOOD! Their breakfast sandwiches are amazing and can be simple or deluxe depending on the ingredients you want. The supplies they use are so fresh, soft, and served hot. Quick, friendly service and very inexpensive! $12 for 2 breakfast sandwiches and some drinks rivals fast food prices. If they had a drive thru I would be here every day. Seriously recommend it if you're looking for a sit down restaurant quality breakfast without devoting the time (or having to do your hair on Saturday morning). I can't wait to try their lunches!"}
{"text":"I am such a regular that the owners know me as soon as I pop in the door! I absolutely love their friendly service and food! Both are so amazing! I constantly enjoy delicious homemade style food as well as a pleasant smile and sweet conversation! 
Thank you rainbow donuts!!"}
{"text":"If I was on death row and got to choose my last meal, I would go with a box or two of Rainbow Donuts.  Hopefully, that would be enough to kill me, and I would go with a big powdered sugar, chocolate, glazed smile on my face.  But since I'm a happy free man, I choose to go to Rainbow for a healthier option (only 2 or 3 delicious donuts at a time).."}
{"text":"We discovered this place last year and are never disappointed. Their donuts are excellent and the breakfast croissants are my go-to fast casual breakfast choice. The staff is friendly, giving the facility a welcoming vibe. Occasionally they'll even throw in an extra donut in our box. If you're in the area, check it out!"}
{"text":"Been going to a different donut shop for awhile, but decided to make a change and I was not disappointed. This is definitely going to be our new donut shop! Friendly, nice, and have a wonderful selection. They also have a great donut happy hour on Monday and Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Great service! I got the submarine sub which was amazing. The bread was soft. Donuts were pretty decent. But more importantly the prices were unbeatable"}
{"text":"Great variety.  Great quality.  Delightful staff.  A treasure in our neighborhood.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Not your typical run of the mill donut shop. Awesome Staff! Awesome Food!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy we found this place. The donut holes are amazing! Exactly how I like them! The iced coffee is great and I love the variety of syrups available. This place reminds me of the donut shops I grew up around in the bay area! We plan on being regulars here!"}
{"text":"Very good cafe! We just moved to Phoenix and have been looking for a breakfast place that is quick and affordable. 
The breakfast burritos were awesome, and we normally aren't donut people, but the long johns were worth it. 
We are very excited to try their lunch times."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time today. I got the tuna sandwich with croissant it was amazing! The owner is very nice. I will com back here again."}
{"text":"This is a great place! In the morning the donuts are always so fresh. All of my family enjoys going here. My favorite donut is the maple bar. But I have yet to have one that I didn't like! Staff is friendly and courteous. A great donut shop."}
{"text":"Hit Rainbow Donuts twice in the last 2 days, mainly to order takeout lunch. Impossible to just do a Reuben without also ordering a couple of donuts. Every item was delicious and served with a smile."}
{"text":"I don't really seek out donuts but I had a craving for them and my husband took me after Sunday mass two weeks ago. I have to say, they offer a tremendous deal for a really affordable price. I ordered a breakfast burrito with bacon, egg and cheese and it came with a coffee and a donut of my choosing. My husband ordered a bagel sandwich and he also received a coffee and a donut of his choosing. All this for under $15! We'll definitely be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"These are the BEST donuts that I have found in the valley.  They have a happy hour on Monday and Tuesdays, though I forget what time.  However even without happy hour pricing their prices are really reasonable.  THey do charge extra for orders under $3 with a debit/credit card, so be sure to order at least half a dozen.  They also have a cafe like feel, serving more than just donuts- sandwiches, etc.  Nice seating area allows you to enjoy whatever delicious treat you have chosen.  Be sure to try their pink glazed donuts.. bet you cant have just one!"}
{"text":"Donuts and breakfast food are AMAZING. Not to mentions everyone is so nice and helpful. Great way to start your morning!"}
{"text":"The best donut place I have found in Scottsdale! It is similar to Shipleys in the south!"}
{"text":"This is the place to go for the best donuts! My grandkids love it. I've also had an bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and that was tasty as well."}
{"text":"The donuts and donut holes are AMAZING!!! I will never go to Dunkin Donuts again. Rainbow Donuts is less expensive too!!"}
{"text":"Not a chain of garbage donuts. Authentic, made-daily, properly made donuts. As a fat person from Texas, I was raised on good donuts. This is the best I have found in Arizona thus far."}
{"text":"This small doughnut shop has some real high quality doughnuts. The verity was great and the service was very good. The coffee was limited in choices but that's ok because they had some good strong brews there. The doughnuts were soft and sweet perfectly fried and well displayed. As I mentioned the place is pretty small most will want to take their treats to go but we sat and enjoyed ours there because we were heading back home 4 hours north.I enjoyed stopping in for some breakfast."}
{"text":"Rainbow Donuts is THE BEST. After a confusing mixup with finding a dessert for my wedding reception, the owner, Jason, said they would rush a batch of 20 dozen donuts! They also threw in a few dozen extra and made my wife and I two heart  shaped donuts with pink frosting. Not only are their donuts great, but their hospitality is incredible! They saved our reception and we can't thank them enough!"}
{"text":"The donut...  Arguably the best of all breakfast pastries, if not the best of all breakfast foods.  In this reviewer's opinion, Rainbow Donuts makes some of the best donuts in Phoenix.  

Their donuts are light and crispy and taste like they were made from scratch instead of culled from a 100lb bag of \"donut mix\" like the big chains.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband stopped by and bought a dozen for co-workers a year ago since we live close to here and he works in the East Valley.  It was an immediate hit!  Now it's just expected that he'll bring a dozen every week, and there is major disappointment if he doesn't.  They have very fresh and delicious doughnuts.  I knock them off a star for not fixing their menu (at the bakery and online).  They do not have muffins or cakes like their menu claims.  But doughnuts?  They know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"This is the best bakery in the area! They even have great sandwiches for lunch. The bread is amazing & always so fresh! They have a pumpkin doughnut that phenomenal."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the area, and excellent breakfast food.
The staff are beyond courteous. A real treat to come here.
The only thing that could improve would be the chocolate frosting, not very chocolaty tasting. 
A moot issue, really. This place is tops."}
{"text":"Great apple fritters!  Really enjoyed the breakfast burrito with great service and a very energetic environment."}
{"text":"This place is awesome- the donuts are excellent but so is the rest of the food! I had a breakfast burrito that was up there with the best I've had. I'm lucky enough to live nearby but if you're in the area, definitely give them a try!"}
{"text":"Rainbow donuts has really good fresh donuts. The staff is very friendly. I usually will pick some up for an event. They have a good variety. The earlier you come the better section they have. I highly recommend these local donuts. As, the national donut chains don't even compare to these..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I was actually looking for a place that served boba drinks and this is one place that happened to popped up on my phone screen. They serve various types of boba drinks and many various type of yummy tasting donuts! This place is closed to work so I like to stop by afterwards to grab a quick snack! The employees here are extremely friendly. A+ for their commitment in providing great customer service. I recommend trying the honeydew boba smoothie, the egg & cheese burrito, the thai tea and of course! All of the donuts!!!! ;) yum!"}
{"text":"Oh, Rainbow Donuts... I love you.  Passionately, unabashedly LOVE you.  There isn't a better donut in town - chains like Dunkin Donuts don't come close.  Every single flavor is fried to perfection with the perfect amount of glaze.  Mmmmhmmm. Delish."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times for donuts to take to work.  Every single time the staff absolutely loves these.  The RC cola is now gone too lol."}
{"text":"Seriously...the best donut I've ever had.  Once you eat these, grocery store or Dunkin Donuts do not compare.  I have been a fan from their first store on Cave Creek and the same sweet owners have opened up this new store where the old Rubio's used to be.  I was craving a burrito and noticed the Rainbow Donuts sign and drove right in.  Their donuts are fresh, not heavy, big and melt in your mouth.  They do have a nice big menu for lunch and dinner and are open until 8pm!!  Donuts anytime.

I'm so proud of them and that neighborhood just got a kick in the pants.  What a great addition!"}
{"text":"Maple bacon cream-filled cruller! The most delicious and decadent thing that I really don't need to eat. All the donuts are amazing really. They're very friendly here, and more than once I've gotten a few complimentary donut holes in my bag. Sandwiches are good too."}
{"text":"Excellent donuts. The cronuts are also really delicious. What always brings me back though, is the staff. The people that work here are so nice and they always offer me an extra treat on the house. Such great customer service!"}
{"text":"I love the quickness of these guys! Their donuts are amazing! Don't discount the other items on the menu either!"}
{"text":"I am so glad we stumbled across this place! My boyfriend and I both unexpectedly got the day off on Easter, and were looking for breakfast. Obviously typical brunch restaurants were out of the question, so we decided to pop in here for donuts. Well, we ended up getting 2 breakfast burritos as well, and thank goodness we did! They were hot and fresh and so filling! We've been back almost every weekend and the food and service are always wonderful."}
{"text":"Best donuts I've had in the metro area so far.  I caught them between the breakfast and lunch rush so had the counter all to myself and they still had a great selection.  The employees were very friendly as well.  When I'm working back in this area I'll be sure to stop in again and try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I love coming here on the weekends for their breakfast special, sausage, egg, and cheese croissant with a donut and a drink for around $6. Sometimes I like to come here during the week for breakfast too but don't tell her that! ;)"}
{"text":"My husband and I are SO glad we discovered this place. It is 5 miles from our house but worth the drive. 

The donuts are fresh, great variety, great tasting and inexpensive. SO much better than Dunkin and Krispy Kreme IMHO."}
{"text":"I could not be happier with the service I received at this spot! My husband and I love their cronuts, they are unique and better then any other I have ever have. I decided to have Rainbow Donuts make their cronuts for a large gathering we were hosting and wanted to serve the cronut as dessert. And I will tell you every person fell in love after one bite! 
We have also ordered sandwiches from here and they are always good and filling, but my love is for donuts and they top the charts! No competition!"}
{"text":"I have been to a couple Rainbow Doughnuts in AZ and CA. This location is the best! Every month I treat my coworkers to 4 dozen doughnuts from here. Everyone is thrilled to see the simple white box filled with their soft, delectable baked goods! The store is family owned and serves a $6 daily breakfast special that includes a sandwich or burrito, one pastry (sometimes 2), and a cup of coffee. They also serve chai tea and luncheon sandwiches. They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"A weekend favorite! They make the best chocolate covered old fashioned donuts! The price is still reasonable for a dozen donuts as well at about $10.00.

Their selection is excellent and the staff is friendly. Their donuts are much better than what Dunkin Donuts has to offer."}
{"text":"Wife asked me what I wanted from here for breakfast as she was heading out. Tried to look up their menu online but the website is down. Annoying. Fortunately the pics from other Yelpers of various food items helped me choose. I've been here a couple of times before, the donuts are pretty good but the food portions are a little on the small side and there's apparently somewhat of a language barrier if you don't mention something that's actually on the menu. One time I asked for hash browns.. confusion.. potatoes.. more confusion.. what type of potato? Then a sad shaking of the head. We don't have any. And yet I see home fries in one of the Yelp pics.  Anyway, it's an okay option for breakfast but a better option for dessert."}
{"text":"I think these are probably the best donuts I've had out. Remind me so much of donuts from my childhood and ones my Grandma made in her kitchen. Very friendly and appreciate the business. Every time I go, I feel valued as a customer.  It is not close to me but I drive over there just to pick them up for company. The variety is so nice as well as all the other menu items they have. Give it a try. It's a gem."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts and great selection to choose from. Rare to find coconut donuts made so well. Service is top notch and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a Dunkin patron, but this place has a much better donut and food selection. If it was closer to my office, I'd be here every day."}
{"text":"Super friendly people own this business. If a customer comes in, and the kids aren't with them, they ask how their kids are. It always looks and feels like an extension of someone's family."}
{"text":"Sometimes you get that sweet tooth. This place is gonna satisfy your cravings. I come get donuts here once in a while. Good donuts friendly service ..."}
{"text":"Freshly made donuts with some love.  Shopping here takes me back to when I was a kid and my grandmother and I would go to the bakery and pick out a dozen donuts for  breakfast.  There's soul here and buying small business and local is always better than large and corporate.  They also serve a sandwich special for $7.99 that I'll try next time I'm in the area for lunch.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We tried out this place for Father's Day. My father in law loves pastries and fortunately we found some yummy ones at this place. The only bummer was that they didn't have any turnovers or jelly filled croissants as the menu said. But everything we got was delicious. Will definitely go again :)"}
{"text":"I normally just stop at dunkin or krispy kreme, no more. I happened to search for donuts on Yelp and found Rainbow Donuts. I stopped in on my way to work today and got 2 bakers dozen - they give you 14 in their bakers dozen. And the woman working the counter was so friendly and welcoming. When I mentioned it was my first time there, she gave me a free donut. My co-workers loved the donuts and a lot of them actually have visited their other locations and nothing but nice things to say."}
{"text":"Love their sugar donuts as well as their filled donuts! My 6 year old nephew loves any of their donuts that have icing. My older sister says their apple fritters are the best she's ever had. My little sister loves their bear claws!"}
{"text":"Donuts were decent but nothing great. The coffee was terrible. Luke warm from one of those pump-it-yourself dohickies. On the upside the place was clean and the service was good. I would prefer Dunkin', Krispy Kreme or Bosa."}
{"text":"They are donuts. If you've had a bakery donut, you've had a Rainbow donut.  Really friendly staff.  Can't go wrong here, really."}
{"text":"I visit at least once a week and let me you, amazing donuts!  They are so fresh, soft, melt in your mouth! Huge variety, very cheap prices, and quick service too.  Don't waste your time at a gas station or supermarket, save your money and come here!    I also hear their lunch/deli is incredible but I have yet to try it.  Update soon!"}
{"text":"This is a magical place! The donuts are light and fluffy. The owners are wonderful people. They have so much passion for what they do. So much love is put into every donut. Try it once and you will be hooked...."}
{"text":"It's kind of crazy that I'm just now doing a review I've been going here for three years now every Friday before school it's our tradition. I call ahead and order scrambled eggs so I don't have to add to my wait time and they always know it's me they're like family. Honestly all the donuts are amazing this is the real deal don't even bother going anywhere else. But actually the ham and cheese croissant is also amazing and their lunches are spectacular. Sandwiches are all good we love the burritos as well. My favorite donut is the glazed Bavarian cream filled it's basically like a Bismarck but instead of having jelly inside it's the Bavarian cream and only with glaze on the top amazing I'm pretty sure it's unique to them. Once you go here you will be addicted and you won't want to go anywhere else!"}
{"text":"Food was okay, service was really slow, and selection was very poor. They were out of many things which I would think would be standard items. Overall, it was okay for the area, but I will not personally eat here again."}
{"text":"Donuts are what they do 3rd best. They bake their own sandwich bread. Get anything with croissant."}
{"text":"We love this place.

We walk here multiple times every week with our two year old. 

Their burritos and breakfast sandwiches are always great. And they have the best selection of donuts and different pastries around. And they always throw a couple of donut holes in to our box for our little one."}
{"text":"Love this place! My Fiancé and I discovered this place when I had a random craving for Donuts. We stopped in one morning and were VERY pleasantly surprised. The staff is friendly and welcoming. The Donuts are delicious, I always get the Boston crème and WOW!! So yummy!! Very reasonably priced as well :)"}
{"text":"My coworker brought in donuts from this place and had me try one. AMAZING!!! It was so good and a million times better than Krispy Kreme and their air and sugar donuts.  One Rainbow Donut actually filled me completely up.  They're sinfully delicious."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I would give it 10 stars if I could. I had an ultimate grilled cheese that was superb. I ate a blueberry glazed donut with fruit loops on top and a chocolate glazed donut with coco puffs on top. The donuts were so good. They were so light and had the perfect flavor. My friend got a egg and cheese breakfast burrito that was so simple but probably the best breakfast burrito either of us have tried. Everything here just melted in your mouth. You get full and don't feel miserable afterwards. Definitely worth the money! I would honestly pay more."}
{"text":"I have been to other Rainbow Donut shops and loved them. This experience was not what I expected. I ordered a doughnut and small coffee which came to $4.54. First, this seemed higher priced than I remember but then the girl proceeds to get my coffee. I asked for coffee creamer but instead, she gets out a pitcher and tries to pour creamer into the cup herself. Apparently, all she did was put in a few drops. So, coffee with no cream. All the while she is sniffling and wiping her NOSE! If she is not well, she should stay home! Then people that apparently worked there or were related to one or more employees came in and started a very loud conversation in an Asian language with the employees behind the counter. It was really obnoxious, so I tossed out the coffee left forgetting to ask why my doughnut and coffee cost so much. Overall, this experience was a disaster."}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying these doughnuts are in a word......AWESOME. My favorite aspect of this establishment is that you can buy doughnuts on Monday and Tuesday from 12pm to 6pm for half price. I mean what makes it an incredible deal is that you can get a dozen doughnuts for less than 6 bucks and half a dozen for just under 4 bucks. Now here is the big finish.....despite the fact that they doughnuts sit there all day for sale they still taste just like they did at 5:00 am when they were first made. I mean the primary reason I don't buy doughnuts say after 10:00 am is because they just don't taste as good 2 hours previously. This bakery is the EXACT OPPOSITE......you won't be disappointed at all if you need an afternoon doughnut fix. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything you could want in a donut shop. Excellent quality, clean, friendly, priced right, easy parking.  Super nice owners"}
{"text":"Stopped in again right before closing.  Owners (who are from Cambodia and speak Khmer) were again so pleasant and generous.  Tried another apple fritter. Perfection! Not overbaked and full of apples. Also sampled a glazed old fashioned. So yummy! These lovely people know how to do doughnuts right."}
{"text":"Great spot, good breakfast, quick and really friendly people!! Donuts are solid definitely a place to stop at!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff.   Visiting with toddlers from Florida so we were up EARLY!  Food was fantastic and staff was super friendly and accommodating.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best doughnuts I have ever had! They are fluffy and delicious. The employees are very nice and helpful. Thank you for a good experience"}
{"text":"Throughout the years they have consistently provided excellent food and outstanding service. We love their selection of deli goods and treats. We come in every Sunday before church and they are very timely with a great positive attitude! Happy they are right around the corner from where we live"}
{"text":"While out running errands, we stopped into this place. I had it bookmarked on my Yelp list because I have a sweet tooth and you can't go wrong with a donut .

Rainbow  Donuts Cafe is located in a strip like mall, next to Piccolli's pet feed store. It has a mom and pop, neighborhood feel. When we arrived, the selection wasn't vast. We placed our order and paid prior to sitting at a table. We sat at a table near the window to soak up the sun. 

The donuts were a big disappointment and overpriced. The food was fresh and tasty but not unique. The cashier and other staff were very professional, polite and welcoming. 

The positives didn't warrant that I spent just as much here as I would for a meal at Red Lobster. 

Conclusion:

Get there early to get a better donut selection and sure a meal as it is plentiful. I honestly would try this place again because it was clean, the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"So I decided to tag along with my pops on a Friday morning for his birthday and this is a neighborhood Jem ! I spent my high school years in the neighborhood and made a random stop ! The selection of donuts is a plenty , but had to go with the classic chocolate covered and rainbow sprinkled donuts with some strong  cold brew! Thoroughly impressed by the service and freshness of the donuts!"}
{"text":"I only discovered Rainbow Donuts recently despite having lived in the area for five years, and boy have I been missing out. I love their pastries, but the main draw for me is the boba tea. Try the Thai Ice Tea or the Green Tea! Hours also cannot be beat -- 4 am to 6 pm daily. It requires massive willpower not to be a daily customer."}
{"text":"Don't treat this place as just your average donut shoppe! It's all that and a bag of chips (literally they sell chips too) Not only do they offer scrumptious freshly made donuts and pastries & hot breakfast items but a wide variety of deli style sandwiches as well!! 

I've been here so many times but I've yet to order lunch!? I tried a turkey & cheese on a buttery croissant- it was so big I couldn't finish it! I ordered the combo which came with a bag of chips, fountain drink and choice of donut. My sandwich was outstanding and I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"The donut I had here was exquisite! I ate the whole thing!!! I also ordered an egg and cheese croissant and that was okay - nothing sets it apart though.

I will come back again and try a drink...and of course another donut."}
{"text":"Rainbow donuts has the widest array of delicious donuts. The customer service at this location is always excellent. I highly recommend visiting here for an amazing experience. I also recommend the Thai Iced Tea!! :)"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this spot and they can't get rite of me if they were rude & cursed me out every day.. Lol Bagel croissant are amazing, donutsof course are amazing also. :) Tried the mango smoothie and that was amazing. Random but egg rolls were amazing too. Came Crunchy.. Staff are sweet, place is clean And they have espresso shots!  Boom!! Drop it, did I mention their open at 4 am."}
{"text":"They were very nice about doing a custom order of solar eclipse looking doughnuts. Party guests loved them! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Great donut options. Great customer service! Well worth the drive a couple miles past Dunkin donuts."}
{"text":"Finally stopped here after seeing it for years on my commute to work. I knew they had boba, so I ordered a Thai Iced Tea with boba. It was yummy! They had an extensive menu of donuts and sandwiches, so I'll be back to try more."}
{"text":"So this morning I was minding my own business when out through the windows I see a guy bringing in 3 BOXES of donuts. At that moment in time I had no clue about the gluttony that was about to occur.
The receptionist and I both look at each other, we look at the boxes without pause we look for a box that had not been closed properly. Dang, they were all taped up and it was in that moment that I knew I had two choices, 1) walk away 2) break into that mother... you guessed it, without even a pause I broke into that box. Upon opening that box, I saw things I never thought I would. In those boxes were some of the most incredible looking donuts I have ever laid my eyes upon. It was in that moment that I fell in love..... Really, it was that true moment of love at first sight. I knew we were meant for each other. A chocolate covered donut with FRUITY PEBBLES and a single lone Lucky Charms Marshmallow. 
I can't even begin to describe how delicious that donut was, soft and fluffy like I was almost eating air, sweet but not too sweet and the fruity pebbles and that single marshmallow really just made it so much more. 
I could sit in a dark room all alone and eat a box of those donuts all by myself, and maybe one day I will!"}
{"text":"Awesome donuts! So fresh, moist, delicious! Great selection. Heaviest dozen donuts I ever carried. Friendly staff. Perfection!"}
{"text":"I come here every Friday to get donuts for my staff at work. The family are friendly and remember regulars. Everyone is fretted with a smile. The donuts are fresh, made on site. But the sandwiches and other food items are well prepared and delicious as well. Comfortable atmosphere, family friendly, well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Donuts were fresh & EVERYTHING others mentioned in previous reviews. Service was friendly & attentive. I am not sure if it was the time of day or just day of the week (late Saturday) Most of the menu choices I was interested in ordering were not available such as: eggplant panini or veggie grilled sandwich. Nice clean place. I will be back."}
{"text":"To be honest I have had better donuts from Basha's. However, their apple fritter is one of the best I have EVER had. My wife and I came in for a Sunday morning treat and bought a half dozen donuts. They were dry and unexciting, except the fritter. The price vs. quality does not warrant my return. Sorry, Rainbow Donuts, but you need to do something that sets you apart from the others in the donut game."}
{"text":"Perfect for breakfast! They have a vast selection of donuts and other pastries, not to mention sandwiches, burritos, croissants, and more! I love that they have such a variety - it makes coming here an easy decision and the food is so good!"}
{"text":"The doughnuts are awesome. the breakfast burrito is ok at best, the bagel was pretty good. If it were just doughnuts, then this place def deserves to be rated 9/10 no problem. ill come back again though. we'll get certain things here tough."}
{"text":"These are my favorite donuts ever. I love the buttermilk, chocolate covered buttermilk, apple fritters, cake donuts, donut holes, you name it, and I love it! The workers are all so friendly, too. Now they just need to figure out how to make a calorie-free donut."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time today.  Great counter presentation just what you should expect.  :)   Got half a dozen donuts, a mix of glazed, cake and long johns loved them all.b I had a cafe mocha, it  was perfect, my husband had a strawberry smoothie which was also great.  Tab was about $12 so it was a great value we will definitely go back  soon and look forward to trying some of their breakfast and lunch menu.       Give them a try!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Best apple fritters in town! The staff is always friendly and the service is always prompt!"}
{"text":"Incredible donuts! Not too sweet like Krispy Kreme, better tasting varieties than Dunkin and great service! The people are super nice and friendly. I go out of my way for this place, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here at 5 a.m. and was pleasantly surprised they were open on a Sunday at 4 a.m. How wonderful that I managed to find one of the few places open this early on my ride home. They truly eclectic and amazing selection of donuts and pastries. They have a very wide selection of breakfast lunch and dinner made at any time. Clean and restrooms were very clean. A wonderful experience at 5 a.m. Unfortunately cannot buy single donut holes but that may just be good for my diet."}
{"text":"I've been going to Rainbow Donuts since their first location was opened on N. Cave Creek Rd.  Then another one popped up on N. 7th St. in the Sunnyslope, AZ area.  And then, again, I drove by the E. Thunderbird location where another establishment had been and \"Voila\"  ~  Rainbow Donuts  ~  closer to my home than the others!  That's a \"bad\" thing, right?  Anyway, their donuts are top notch although the raspberry filled jelly donuts, usually my favorite anywhere, manage to disappoint.  Why, may you ask?  The jelly inside is a raspberry \"flavored\" concoction - not a derivative of actual raspberries.  Other than that, (and I HAVE to eat my donuts warmed up!)  Rainbow Donuts still continues to be my favorite.  When I was there last month, I perused their other offerings, as well.  In addition to donuts are breakfast sandwiches, muffins, bagels, lunch sandwiches, other pastries, espresso and smoothie drinks.  There are other valley locations, as well.  Try it - you'll like/love it!"}
{"text":"Their Boston cream donut is the best donut I ever had.  Puts Krispy Kreme to shame.  And their bobas and drinks are excellent.  Not only that, the lady that owns it is very nice, accommodating, pleasant and so sweet.  She really cares.  Unfortunately for my waist line, I found a new place to eat."}
{"text":"Incredible donuts.  Nothing too fancy, no nouveau-chic gastronomique donuts (well, maybe a bacon topped donut, but limited), just all around solid, tasty, light, fresh donuts.  Krispy Kreme and DD doesn't hold a candle to these.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came here on a busy Saturday morning. I was very surprised to see the line almost out the door, considering this place has never looked this busy every time I visit the plaza. Must've been their morning rush. I feel as if they could've used another person or two behind the counter. 

We had the braided glaze donut and a maple cake donut. I'm pretty health conscious of the things that I eat, so if I'm gonna eat a donut, it'd better be a damn good donut. Definitely more than what we needed, but I had been craving donuts for quite some time now and this definitely filled the void.  The donuts were fresh, fluffy, and delicious. I couldn't stop eating it! I would definitely come back here for the donuts alone.

We also ordered egg, cheese, and potato bfast burritos. Those were good, too much on the salty side for my tastebuds, but still satisfying esp w the side of salsa. Think I'll try the bfast croissantwich next time.  

We sat and ate our donuts while waiting for our burritos. Looking around, they also offered cold sandwiches and Asian beverages. I'm always a little apprehensive with Asian beverages at places like a donut shop...but I might give it a try one day. There was a lot of seating indoor and outdoor. A lot of the customers seemed happy and satisfied...as were we. I'm happy that I finally got to visit this place after living nearby for 1.5yrs. Now I know, there's an awesome donut place right around the corner."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts.  Fluffy and a nice mix of savory sweet.  The owners/staff are incredibly sweet and care about their customers and their product.  Fantastic restaurant!"}
{"text":"LOOOVVEEEEE this place, best options in the morning of coarse for the selection of donuts available like any other donut place but man are these donuts fantastic! And their Panini pressed sandwiches OMGAADDD soooo good the turkey was super juicy and fresh tasting and I could just go on. And the Bobba drinks YUM! So many options and it's now my new fav. Breakfast place! THANKS!"}
{"text":"I've been to two locations, this one and on off of Cave Creek. Both have great donuts. This location is very friendly and feels less cramped. I don't eat many donuts but when I do, this is the spot. 
Much better than the large chain places."}
{"text":"Great donuts all the time every time! Cake and raised always on point, although I like cake best. Service is top notch too."}
{"text":"Someone bought some of these donuts for me & my staff.  Their hours are open pretty late for a donut shop. Unfortunately when you get there on a sunday afternoon the best donuts are gone.  Very disappointing especially when you dtive from far west valley like buckeye."}
{"text":"Donuts were very fresh and friendly service. We had donuts holes and a double chocolate donuts. Everything looks delicious. They also serve breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"I would suggest this place the service is good and they get you out quick with a full belly..lol"}
{"text":"Don't let the donut in the name of this café scare you away. It is an awesome donut shop, but it is much more.

To start with, they are very friendly in a quiet sort of way. All you need to do is sit for a while and watch the steady stream of regulars on a Saturday or Sunday morning to know this café has a loyal following.

We were all about donuts on our most recent visit. They have all the flavors you could possibly desire, even bowing to recent trends like a maple long john with bacon. We passed on that choice, instead opting for a heavy dose of rainbow sprinkles. The raised donuts are light, soft and delicious.

Consider the Baker's Dozen, a best buy, if you are taking donuts to go. The fourteen count drops the price to about 70 cents a donut, a few cents less than the standard dozen.

The diversity of menu offerings will no doubt surprise you. They have an extensive menu of sandwiches, soups, salads, Panini, breakfast burritos, muffins, bagels...

They also have convenient group pricing for lunch and breakfast items, so you can bring more than just donuts to the office.

Open seven days a week, 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. The folks here are really nice. Give them a try.

09/2714 Update: The croissant breakfast sandwiches were delicious (and huge)! More importantly, a very picky coffee drinker in our group LOVED the pumpkin spice coffee and the syrup station. Thought she was going to settle in for the entire day. In an interesting turn of events, the four year old in our party passed on the usual rainbow sprinkles and opted for a glazed red velvet cake donut. And loved it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I use to have to go to work at 5am and they were open even a little earlier than 5 which made for a quick breakfast on the go. They're super friendly and keep things tasting fresh!"}
{"text":"I had driven someone to the airport well before dawn, stopped in cell ohone parking lot to figure out where to breakfast. I scanned yelp and picked Rainbow. I should have spent more time researching. I wanted an actual breakfast. I ordered a ham, egg and cheese on toast. It was okay. I looked over the donuts and just couldn't resist. I got a chocolate coconut donut. It was pretty good,  not great enough for the calories for me.  But if you want a donut,  friendly service at a good price, this  is a great place.  

Don't go for the breakfast sandwiches.  Spend more than 2 minutes researching yelp when picking a place."}
{"text":"Walk in today, Sunday, at 12:00 pm and they are out of glazed doughnuts??? Glazed doughnuts... Umm those are kind of popular. So if you are going to open a doughnut shop I would have those readily available. Like if your KFC you may want to have plenty of original recipe, I have a feeling that may be a popular item as well. So from now on I will visit one of the other dozen places around here to get doughnuts. They have glazed doughnuts by the dozens."}
{"text":"A small local donut cafe.  They have a pretty large selection of your standard donuts, nothing totally unique, but you will likely find what you're in the mood for.  In addition to the donuts is a pretty good selection of deli sandwiches.  There are at least 4 different types of coffee, and an assortment of flavoring too add to it."}
{"text":"We are two of many many regulars at Rainbow donuts. Good stuff!! Fresh delicious pastries (they are creative as well) and freshly made breakfast items. We usually get breakfast burritos and they are yum! Fast and delish, always solid service too!"}
{"text":"The best doughnuts !  When ever I bring to work or social event , always hear how soft and delicious they are.  Apple fritters are my favorite and then the yummy croissant/doughnut thing .  Staff is super friendly too."}
{"text":"So you're like my favorite people... Family owned and operated and it shows. You know when your mom's food tasted so good and you could never figure out why? It's because she loved you and made her food with love. These guys LOVE doughnuts and they make them that way. 

I can get like 14 doughnuts and 3 large iced coffees for what Starbucks would have the 3 coffees. Don't be fooled by the large corporate conglomerates, buy local and support Rainbow. 

P.S. Bacon Maple Doughnut, you're welcome."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong clean friendly rather inexpensive as far as I'm concern 99 cents for a ice coffee hell yea no one can beat that I really have no complaints about this franchise at all five stars all the way"}
{"text":"not only do they have great doughnuts and bagel sandwiches, the staff is super friendly and inviting. smiles when I walk through the door and treat me like they really care about my experience. highly recommend this place. :)"}
{"text":"Went by this morning to grab a few donuts.  The real star was the glazed cinnamon twist; pretty perfect if you ask me.  Also had a chocolate glazed cruller and an old fashioned donut (I think they might be sour cream).  GET THE CINNAMON TWIST!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts  and great owners. Thank you for being open on Christmas, we devoured each and everyone of them. So fresh and yummy, I will never go anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is friendly and donuts always fresh!  they also have great breakfast burritos that I usually favor while I'm there.   Just the simple egg and cheese burrito with a side of salsa makes my belly full.  It also helps that the staff usually throws a couple of complimentary donut holes to our order each time. :)"}
