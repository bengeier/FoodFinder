{"text":"Their 40+ years in the business really shows. Everything from their venue to the food menu and service was on point. There's no doubt in my mind that SMS Catering Services is the best caterer and event venue in the Charlotte NC metro area. You can see their services, prices and request a quote on their website, CateringCharlotte.com"}
{"text":"Ugh!  Where do I even start?  We attended an event held there this past weekend.  Dreadful.  The \"pulled\" pork was actually chopped up in a food processor.  It was so fine, we were not sure we were eating pork.  There was absolutely no flavor and since they got lazy and sent it through a food processor to \"pull\" it, the pork was very watery.  It was disgusting.  The baked beans were obviously from a Cisco can--not freshly made.  The cole slaw was also from a can--watery and disgusting.  The chicken was over cooked and dry.  They smothered it in a salty vinegar sauce to try to re-moisten it.  Did not work.  It was still dry and rubbery.  The only edible thing was the salad.  You would thing that because they like to serve watery dishes, they would supply slotted spoons for the rest of the world that doesn't want soupy beans and pork. Nope!  Every serving spoon was solid, so you had to sit and drain your selection or end up with a sludgy mess on your plate.  As far as beverages went, there was stadium pricing so make sure you bring lots of cash.  $8.00 for a mixed drink in a tiny, tiny plastic cup.  $6.00 for a glass of wine poured from a box--barely 4 oz in the glass.  They ran of beer.    The grounds are nice.  They do have a mini-golf course, volley ball, corn hole, ping pong.   Just bring your own food and liquor in.  Do not let them cook for you!  This place says they have \"good BBQ\".  It is actually inedible."}
{"text":"I attended an event here recently and was blown away! 100% first class all the way.  The pulled pork was to die for.  Great facility!  Perfect for the whole family to attend an event.  It's obvious why SMS is one of the oldest and most established catering outfits in Charlotte.  They really know how to treat their guests.  Do yourself a favor and choose these guys for your next event. Trust me - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We had SMS Catering cater our food for our wedding. We had a backyard wedding, so we wanted them to look at the venue before the big day to see how everything would be set up. They came out and talked everything over with this and gave us suggestions as well. They were super friendly people to work with. They allowed us to have everything we wanted and were very accommodating. The entire time they were there they made sure we were happy with everything and if we wanted them to do anything differently. They were awesome. I will recommend them to others, as well as use them for catering needed in the future!"}
{"text":"I found SMS Catering when I was looking for my wedding a year or two ago. We used them for a work picnic for 130 people serving at 2 different times. SMS worked with out budget and provided and exceptional amount of food. We did the Hamburger and Hot dog combo- they were delicious. Bob was great to work with. He was very polite, diligent in meeting our needs and the food tasted great. I could not have asked for a better experience. Our cook was also very nice and helpful also. Thank you so much!!"}
