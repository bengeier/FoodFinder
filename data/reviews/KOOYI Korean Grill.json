{"text":"Lots of permutations available since you can pick your own protein, side, and sauce for the rice bowls! I had the naughty pork with sesame kor-slaw (so punny, am I right?) and yuzu mayo. My friend had the chunky beef with kimchi and kooyi sauce. The naughty pork had a nice medium spiciness that wasn't overpowering thankfully. The yuzu mayo is a little bit weird with the pork, but still quite balanced in sourness. The kimchi, which I assume it house-made, is notably delicious.   We also tried the Korean fried chicken which comes with potato chips and a sweet glaze sauce. I would have liked a bit more sauce on the chicken, but it was still enjoyable.   I would definitely return to the restaurant to try some different protein and sauce combinations, and everything on the menu is also very convenient for take-out, perfect for picnics at the park or a grab-and-go lunch!"}
{"text":"It's mad good yo. I'm drooling thinking about it. Ordered the sampler size of Sneaky Beef. Very, Very TASTY. Even their white rice is sooo yummy!"}
{"text":"Second stop of TO food crawl. Ordered the kimchi fries! Pretty good pretty good!   Sugoi!"}
{"text":"Dropped by here around noon for a quick snack. The place was empty so I was expecting service to be quick.   Ordered the kimchi fries and was told the wait would be 7 minutes. It was twice as long. The fries, which were more like chips, came topped with the kimchi, pork, and sauce and came on a small plate.   The flavor was great. The bites where you got a little bit of everything were so good.   I don't think that wait was worth it though. And if you're in this area, there are tons of great food spots that might be better to check out."}
{"text":"I was in Kensington and thought I'd check it out. after all, there's korean fried chicken on the menu, so I had to see how it held up. It's definitely not the same as the KFC you'd get in NYC (it never is), but it wasn't bad. The chicken wasn't a bone in wing or drumstick. it was fried chicken pieces with sauce and potato chips on the side. The chicken was crunchy, and the sauce was tasty.  The best part were the potato chips, not sure what it is they did with them, but they were crispy and airy. all in all,  I wasn't disappointed with it, but I'm not craving to go back any time soon"}
{"text":"We came in on a rainy day - ordered fried chicken and the chicken bowl with Kim chi. It wasn't flavorful.  The fried chicken was basically popcorn chicken (not wings) topped with creme sauce and their sauce. Wasn't crunchy - was ok.  The chicken bowl was disappointing. Didn't have a distinct taste, which is surprising because it has kimchi. Quite underwhelming.  So if you're into heavy, fried \"Korean\" food - then it might be ok."}
{"text":"KOOYI is a tiny shop on Augusta Ave. that serves tapas sized Korean dishes and snacks. Occupying the space that was formerly Fresco's Fish & Chips (who moved just down the street), it is perhaps too small for more than a handful of customers to enjoy at any given time. However, for those who prefer to eat in, there's a nice view of what's going on in Kensington Market to enjoy.  Must-try items: Kimchi Fries  The menu here is inspired by street food, but is made creatively with cuisine quality. The kimchi fries dish is a unique combination of flavours that I found impressive. I've got my eyes on at least a few of the other dishes served here. The prices are nice and allow for experimentation, so I'll be back much sooner than later."}
