{"text":"Decent grilled chicken. Better deal and taste than Swiss Chalet. A bit inconsistent over the few times I have been there, but always good service. For this area, it's the best grilled chicken place."}
{"text":"This is a cheap knock off of Nandos.  I ordered a quarter chicken dinner with fries and the food was so gross I actually took it back to show the cook. The chicken looked like it was microwaved. It was dry and hard. The fries were limp and over oiled. I'd shell out a few more bucks and eat at Nandos. This place is conveniently located on tenth line where all the desi/Asian people live so it's never ever going out of business or style. As for me.... Never again!"}
{"text":"Average food with awful service makes it deserve a single star. The lady taking orders on counter seemed least interested to take order. And the food was just average. Comparing to Nandos would be great error.  The only thing good is the garlic sauce. I would never ever go here."}
{"text":"We were looking for something yummy. We were disappointed. There was customers  there. We were the only ones. Lots of seating and was clean. We ordered a full chicken with grilled veg. The chicken was pre cooked it came within 8 minutes. The mixed veg was pre grilled with only yellow, red and tons of green pepper. There was no other veg in it! I was a  very sad presentaion. We were very disappointed never again will we go."}
{"text":"I know there are other Peri-Peri type chicken places in Mississauga but there wasn't one in NW Mississauga so I'm glad this one opened up. It's fairly similar to the other ones and fairly good, I'd rank it a bit behind Galito's though (but that's far from this one).

When you order a dish and for spiciness you say \"hot\"....it's gonna be hot so go with medium the first time. I'm not a big fan of chicken and I find that a whole chicken from a place like this tastes good on the outside and bland on the inside so I prefer stuff like their wrap and wings. This place also has a bit more of a diverse menu compared to the other places because they offer ribs, staeak, kebabs, and other beef. They do have a few veggie options available as well.

The prices are meh, I'd go more often if they were cheaper but a wrap is $8 so more expensive and smaller than the size of a shawarma and the other prices aren't really any lower than the other chicken places so it's closer to restaurant pricing than fast food. Overall a decent restaurant, worth trying out if you're in the area or if they have some good promo otherwise the same as your local grilled chicken place. Good place to sit in for the family, they don't blast loud music like a certain other chain and they also aren't as crowded as a different chain.

Btw the title of the restaurant is \"Sizzlo'z Flame Grilled Chicken\", the header on here is wrong I think."}
{"text":"I've been there more than a couple of times. The food was decent. Service was kinda slow but it was not complainable. Washrooms were kinda dirty though."}
{"text":"Was staying at the Hampton Inn YYZ and found this place just down the street on Dixie. Looks clean from the street so we stopped in and was pleasantly surprised. It's a little bright inside, but very clean and the owner was working the counter. Very nice guy that welcomed us to Toronto and recommended some meals. We got the Kabobs with sides and a Greek Salad. It was great!  We got spicy and it was a perfect blend of spice. Will definitely go back next time I'm in town. If you're in the area give it a try. Decent portions as well."}
{"text":"My take, been there twice 

Pros small joint better service ( universal Truth )
         Halal ( not that i care) but for all who do
         Ribs,and wedges  are,amazing 
         No long queue like u see,in nandos ( nandos (sheep,follows sheep kinda joint) 

Cons 
         Menus can,be a,bit broad 
         Place is,a bit too small ( dont really caee) 
         Food longer ro be served ( isnt that a good thing )"}
{"text":"The food we got, although not what we ordered, was aweful!  the chicken was cold.  The wedges were cold.  The coleslaw smelled like the mayo had been out of the fridge a while.  We had placed a group order for some of the people I work with.  
Putting aside the food, the service was the worst I have ever seen.  I called back to tell them the order was wrong, and cold.  the girl laughed, and then started speaking to another girl there in another launguage and they both started laughing.  
With that many food choices in the same plaza, don't waste your time or money!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  It's our go to place.. Whenever I want a guilt free meal after a workout,  I always want to do takeout from sizzlos.  Reasonable and just so delicious.  The place gets quite busy with crowds of teenagers at lunch time due to its proximity from school.  They have also included ribs now in their menu and also do free delivery for order above $40. 
Personally I am not a fan of their hot sauce (*too much red chili.  Just burns in your mouth ) I do like the Garlic sauce however."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time late last night to order some takeout food.

I want to start off by saying that the service was really great. The restaurant was actually closed when I arrived. I didn't realize that when I walked in because the door was still unlocked. 

However, I was not asked to leave and they kindly took my order. They did not rush me at all even though they were technically not open. They gave me some recommendations and took the time to answer my questions. 

As for the food, I was happy with it. I ordered a chicken sandwich with fries . It was good, but not great. The fries were nice and I really liked their hot sauce. The sandwich was pretty saucy and tasted okay. The actual chicken inside was not bad. It was a little chewy, but it was still good. It was also covered in a lot of sauce, which helped . 

The price and portions were decent. It cost $9 after tax for just the fries and sandwich, no drink . I would have liked the sandwich to be a little bit bigger (although it wasn't a small sandwich). I also wish the price was slighty cheaper. 

It was still a decent meal that I enjoyed though. Overall, I'm happy. I would eat here again, and next time I will come when they are open."}
{"text":"This place has food way better than nandos chicken in heartland area. Ive been coming to this place almost 2 years and gets better every time. I suggest the family platter so you can try all the things they offer. I suggest to call for pickup for faster service."}
{"text":"Like a couple of other reviews, I have tried this place a few time since it opened. After 4 times, have sworn it off. Poor Service, Poor Communication, Get order wrong EVERY-TIME 4/4, and very pricey for what you get. Nando's is def better."}
{"text":"Loveeee! Flame grilled chicken is most likely my most favorite food in the whole world and while I'm loyal to Nandos, I love this place as well! The food is great, service is quick and friendly and the sauces will make your life! Wonder if I can smuggle them to Texas......."}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy Portuguese grilled Chicken, This is another place. Its more like Nandos style but these guys don't burn the chicken, which is good.   


Food: The chicken was cooked very well and not burnt. The Sizz Fries are more like Peri Peri fries and they tasted very good. The rice was also nice but tasted same as Nandos wasn't different like Mesh Grill. I also tried sizz potato which was dry but could have been better if they had boiled it more and soften it. The portions were great for large families.

Space: plenty of space in the restaurant to enjoy a decent sit in meal. The place got filled up quick at dinner time on Saturday.  Plus lot of parking available. 

Service: Well you have to order so there is not table service, but they do bring the food to your table. In that sense the service wasn't good as the server was just trying to put the food on the table and make a run...plus they didn't bring any sauces till we asked.

For my fellow muslim brothers and sister the entire menu is Halal.

All in all the food is decent, priced as competition, and portions are good for families"}
{"text":"The food was delicious but hygiene of the area was pretty bad because the table was not clean properly. It was alway sticky and whenever one of the employe use the washroom they never cover the smell but to linger out to the main dinning room. All I am going to say good luck eating with poo smell whenever you eat there."}
{"text":"I am revising my review. I have been there regularly now. The quality and value is back to where it was. Try their grilled veggies. They are awesome"}
{"text":"Flavorful juicy chicken, fresh cut fries and amazing wings with the best sauces. Service can be slow sometimes but it never stops us from coming back."}
{"text":"I am giving this place a 2 star for the lack of cleanliness

bathrooms were filthy, looked like it has not been cleaned for a while. better to touch the door handle with a towel. paper towels were all over on the floor.

When we walked into the restaurant all the tables had dirty plates on them, meaning people eat there but the tables had not cleaned. 

We asked the waitress to have one table cleaned she only picked up the plates which still had food particles from previous use(s) so i went to the bath room and got whole bunch of wet paper towels and cleaned the table on my own that's when i found out the sorry state of the bathroom.  Sauce bottles were all sticky and had not been cleaned for a while looked like they had dried up sauce on them. Side counter was full of dirty plates from the moment we walked in until we left.

How did this place pass the health inspection? ... beats me. 

If you are able to see pass the cleanliness problem then the food is good, in my case i was not able to enjoy the food because of that one issue. Perhaps this can be a good take out place."}
{"text":"When they first opened, their chicken was cooked just right. I am a person of high taste, so am really picky when it comes to dining out. Its just that in the one year, everything there has gone downhill. Sometimes the chicken is burnt, other times its just plain dry. Galitos is a whole lot better."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place to get some Peri- Peri Grilled Chicken; definitely a nice change from the usual suspects in my area (Nando's and Mesh Grill). While the actual flavour of the marinade is noticeable different, it isn't necessarily a bad thing; at least for me it wasn't. I found the marinade to have a very substantial tanginess to it; definitely something different, but I didn't mind it. I had the Chicken sandwich so the bread did help with \"levelling out\" the extra tanginess. Regardless of the food, the service was quite alright, but perhaps that's due to the fact that I was the only person there at the time. I'd be willing to give them another shot, but perhaps after awhile."}
{"text":"Amazing prices and food. We particularly love the bbq garlic flavour and wedges. That with the sauce and very reasonable prices keeps us coming back"}
{"text":"Ordered quarter chicken and sizzlo fries. Chicken was burnt black (couldn't eat the skin). It was a small chicken leg. Fries were nothing special. very small portions for the higher than average price for this area and food type. Paid about $10 for this. Would not come back and would not recommend."}
{"text":"I often eat here and don't really know why there are so many bad reviews for this. 

I've eaten at Nando's and definitely like these guys better. Food has good portions and price is reasonable. And taste with the sauces is really good!"}
{"text":"Great chicken and variety of sides.  I can actually finish my plate at Sizzloz and be fully satisfied. 
I might be liking this a bit more because it's so close to me, but it beats getting my chicken at sobeys or the extra drive to Nandos. And it's a local business and always support the locals!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and good service.  The family package is highly recommended.  Try it once and you will be back every time."}
{"text":"Very friendly owners. I came here after work for a quick take out option for my 2y/o & I. They offered and gave my son a free Apple juice because they thought he was cute. 
I found the amount of options were endless. You can get a variety of combos with chicken, wings, salads and sides. 
We got chicken with Greek salad. I added rice and mashes potatoes. Both the rice and the mashed potatoes had garlic overload.  

It was also so spicy, which I think is why my son would not eat it.... Even I took a couple bites of them and that it...meh I liked the chicken but I would not go back here"}
{"text":"Went here after hearing rave reviews from family. Was all right. Had chicken kebab and salad - chicken was kinda dry, but the food was good overall for the price. One of my companions had baked potato, which turned out to be very plain. Another companion had rice which, despite it's colour and supposed spices, lacked any extra flavouring - just tasted like normal rice. One of the servers was really friendly and nice, the other one was just meh. Don't think I'll be returning here anytime soon. As another reviewer mentioned. cleanliness needs some work and customer service too."}
