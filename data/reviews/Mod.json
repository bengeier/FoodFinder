{"text":"With multiple options in the valley for hosting an important meeting or just looking for a great place to get some focused work done, Mod is your ONLY option.  My guests on this particular day were some bankers from San Francisco and they were blown away with Mod PHX.  Great facility, great vibe, well run, and the list goes on.  You vote with your feet and I will certainly be back and can see our footprint expanding at Mod!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for dinner, business meetings, lunch or work. The atmosphere is fantastic. Great meeting room as well. Full technology available. Very modern and comfortable. The service is superb. Caleb is amazing. Rodney the perfect host. Great beer, food and wine selections."}
{"text":"This is a really cool spot.  My friend Nicki happened to notice this on our way to grab lunch in the area one day and suggested we pop in.  I'm sure glad we did!

It's been hard to find anything relatively healthy in this area.  It's either burgers, pizza, chinese or sandwiches crammed with fatty ingredients. 

Thank goodness for Mod!   You have to try the heirloom tomato salad!  Fresh mozzarella, crunchy little wheat croutons and of course fresh heirloom tomatoes!   They come lightly drizzled in sweet balsamic  vinegar and olive oil.  Fresh, filling, delightful!

My friend gets the grilled cheese and always seems to be happy with it.  

The other cool thing about this space is that it's a co-working facility.   If you freelance or need a great meeting space you should consider a membership at this place.  

Note:  membership not required to eat at the cafe."}
{"text":"MOD is the best!  The environment, the food, the team that works there.  Every visit including my first one was an incredible experience.  They worked with me to tailor a plan that works for my business and its been perfect so far.  I highly highly recommend this for anyone looking for a place to work outside of the home without spending a lot of money for a private office.  Very cool environment, you have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Great service, tasty wine on tap, and really amazing artichoke dip! Plus, when there's a plug at my table, who can complain?"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. Cool modern look and airy ambience. 

But sadly after two visits I experienced consistently poor service. Orders on both occasions were wrong and had  I not reviewed take out bags,  I would have left without half of my very expensive order. Very disappointed.  Ps. Parking in garage costs at least $2. And membership required to enjoy other benefits. BUT at least food was good."}
{"text":"Mod is reinventing the concept of co-working space in Phoenix. Mod features work space with an open atmosphere while providing secluded meeting space when needed. Mod is also home to gourmet coffee, exquisite food and an impeccable location. Whether it's just for a day or for a long term space, mod provides the perfect option for those looking for a great co working space in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I really dig Mod. As a local I use it to mainly really get serious on a project I've been putting off and/or having a peaceful but stylish place to meet with partners and clients. It's not perfectly quiet but easily better than a public place where people may not be as mindful of common space. There are meeting rooms to seclude yourself but it's also fun to be in a new type of crossroads for PHX. 

And the cartel coffee is great!"}
{"text":"MOD is a very cool, hip space. By day, it is a meeting room, co-working opportunity. I believe you can pay by the hour or get monthly memberships. In the evening, it's open to the public and they have a full bar and food. There is plenty of seating in different configurations depending on what you require so it's a perfect late meeting spot or just a great space to stop in for a glass of wine. I hosted an event in the space for about 50 people. There was ample room for networking and there's also a patio if the weather is good. Their sound system could use an overhaul but it wasn't terrible. We ordered finger sandwiches and mozzarella tomato appetizers.  These were fantastic.  I'd definitely recommend this mid-town spot for your event needs and I will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing experience, Amazing staff and Amazing facilities. I highly recommend MOD for any meeting, training, or just plain office space for a day. Whatever your needs, they can meet and exceed your expectations. The staff is extremely professional and cater to all your needs, before you can ask they have already thought of it and have it ready for you. I travel a lot for work and am constantly looking for training facilities, hands down they are the best!"}
{"text":"What a great experience!  We opened an office in Phoenix but needed a physical presence to meet with our target audiences. MOD was the perfect solution for us.  The layout, their offerings from drink, food and technology setup was superb!  Plus, the staff was EXTREMELY helpful, friendly and courteous to us and our guests. I couldn't ask for a more hospitable, professional and conducive environment in which to start our office.  They know how to do things the right way.  Not to mention, their price was perfect for our budget.  
I highly recommend any company looking for a shared workplace to MOD - PHX."}
{"text":"Stopped in one Friday. Good after work meeting/drinking place and conference rooms."}
{"text":"now that I have been here for a year, I can absolutely recommend this place. \"AMAZING\" is such an insufficient word. The food is excellent, not what you would expect in a co-working space, the drinks are fantastic and the people are wonderful......this place is a DESTINATION, a place to work, think, drink and gain inspiration.

There is a quiet dignity/understated elegance to this place. I am certainly glad I belong...."}
{"text":"The space is beautiful, with lots of natural light and soaring ceilings. It is my preferred \" escape\" from my dark downtown office. I take refuge here when I need to concentrate on document review and writing.

The food is healthy and very good. The service is also very good.

I tend to set meetings here as an inspiring and dynamic space that cultivates creative business solutions."}
{"text":"Great space for start ups! There are so many different spaces to chose from wether you need to have a private conversation with 2 or a meeting with a bigger group. It's easy to bounce around depending on your needs for the day or stay in one spot if you prefer. All the employees provide top notch service and are so friendly. The staff really goes out of their way for you and creates such personalized service. They also offer a full menu if you are stuck in the office for the day. We are definitely going to miss everyone here!"}
{"text":"Today's visit to MOD is my last. I always give a place three times, especially when they are new and getting their bearings before I absolutely quit them. I'm going to discuss their 3rd strike because that's why I'm done.

Have you ever walked into somewhere and felt you weren't welcome? I feel that every time I walk in there. I am professionally dressed and my money is good, but today apparently not good enough for MOD.

They have Kyoto cold brew drip coffee available. I've bought it before, I've gotten one that was 16 ounces. I've bought other coffee there in larger sizes, but it's too bitter for me. Today I wanted the Kyoto Cold brew in the larger size. Best of both worlds, less bitter and larger!

The attendant said, \"We only sell that item in the 16 ounce size.\" I looked around for a sign or notice that was the case, but didn't see anything. I thought for a moment and then I said, \"Ok, I would like 2 16 ounce Kyoto cold brews please.\"

\"They are expensive,\" she said.

\"That's ok, I'll pay for two,\" and smiled.

\"I can't do that.\" she said.

\"Why not?\" I asked curious. Maybe there is a caffeine limit per customer, or maybe they only had 16 ounces of the brew left... I didn't know.

\"Well, it's a small batch and I need to save some for other customers.\"

I thought about that for a second. It was not opening hours, it was 11 am, not like I was killing their supply at 7 am. I tried to understand why purchasing 2 coffees at 11 am was somehow bad for MOD, but the longer I thought the more insulted I got. 

\"How about I don't buy ANY coffee then. You can sell your coffee to your preferred customers.\" I walked out. I bought nothing and I won't return."}
{"text":"My office became a member here and I'm glad they did. Mod offers a great alternative to the conference room. With lots of windows and comfortable seating, Mod is a great place to meet clients and colleagues. The coffee bar can do anything, the bar has good drinks, and I just tried the food for happy hour. The pork tacos were fantastic! 

For work, we have used the conference room. The rates were reasonable and, again, the atmosphere is great. 

Give it a try."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about Mod and those that helped us put on a fantastic anniversary party for our company. I communicated via email with Ty, and she worked with our budget to make the experience well worth our while. When we arrived to check out the space, we were greeted by Sean, their GM, who was extremely helpful and accommodating. The party went fabulously and those that were on staff were friendly and helpful. Thanks again Mod for a wonderful party!"}
{"text":"Modern and comfy...Tr√©s Chic. Love the ambience! They had great selections of wine. Didn't order food but a friend ordered the grilled cheese and loved it. I wasn't in the mood to eat...which is why I'm only giving it 3 stars. The service was good."}
{"text":"This is one of the best spaces I have worked from. The staff is absolutely incredible! Ty and Danni are gems - I'd hire them in a heartbeat to manage a portion of my business. They are some of the best people I've met in Arizona. Mod is very accommodating and the groups sharing the space are professional/aware the space is being shared.  If you're interested in connecting with likeminded people with a positive vibe you should definitely jump in for a tour. I hope this helps!
