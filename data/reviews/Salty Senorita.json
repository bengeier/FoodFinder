{"text":"I used to visit saltys back in the day when it first opened. Not the best quality food but it was the place to be. The past few years I always suggest going there for a good patio spot but not a place to get good service or food, until today. We had a great bartender named Ben. He made our drinks exactly how we asked and didn't shrug at our sorta demanding needs. He even took our picture to help celebrate our day off! Even more surprising they have a lunch special where you can choose a starter, an entree, 2 sides (sorta like a bento box) It was actually really really good. And it was only $8!!! I would def recommend that to somebody who wants a healthier easy and delicious meal in old town. With a great view and patio! Thanks for changing my option salty seniorita!!!"}
{"text":"This place is lucky that Peoria doesn't have the competition that places like Old Town or Westgate have. The service was terrible when we got it, the food (or at least what they felt like bringing us) was awful, and I waited almost an hour for a basketball game to be turned on while the staff and management messed around behind the bar. I love the bar in Old Town and this place had about 10% of the foot traffic and just couldn't keep up. I'd wait until this place shuts down (which it will) and hope that the new place can deliver."}
{"text":"Had to ask the waitress twice for water, then she disappeared and we couldn't receive our check.  Dishwasher also walked out while we were there..."}
{"text":"The Salty Senorita is one of those places that's \"not the worst, not the best.\"  I've only eaten here when I've had family visiting, as the location is pretty convenient. This restaurant seems like it would be a lot better if they didn't have such a high volume of customers.  I can never tell if they're going for piss drunk college kid-or fancy white pants Scottsdale. Maybe they're going for \"I barfed up Jager on my $800 tuxedo.\" Who knows. Their menu is great, the concepts are great, but the execution is always sloppy, bland, and never quite hits the mark. And you can totally tell that they only hire based on looks because their staff is a joke. Literally some of the worst servers I've ever encountered. Like bloody hell get your act together people, this is your job not your spring break."}
{"text":"The worst meal I have ever had....suffered with food poisoning for two days. Suggest a new Chef!  No rating deserved!"}
{"text":"I have never had such awful service. Our original server rolled her eyes when more of our party showed up and gave our table away. It took the new server 15 minutes to get our drink order. At that time we made our food order too because we were starving and ready. It then took getting a manager to get our waters. When we asked the manager about our food, saying it's taken a while he questioned us what a while was, \"10 minutes? What do you mean a while?\". 40 minutes Fool! Our food took another 40 minutes and was cold and they forgot half the order. My burrito bowl was probably the grossest thing I've had in my mouth in a long time. Not once did our server apologize or give us a timeline. Luckily, he took care of my bill. But when he brought my card back, which they required to hold on to in order for us to even order (who does that?), he had charged me $14 for two margaritas I did not have.  This place is a failure at everything they do. I absolutely can't stand places where the attitude of the staff is of total arrogance and entitlement. I was treated as if I was lucky to even be here. The worst!"}
{"text":"New does NOT mean improved! How disappointing! Liked the old better.  Margaritas are not up to par. I've been common to Salty for at least eight years. My daughter turned 21 and wanted find out why we liked the place so much. How embarrassing! Nothing like before. Salsa? What the hell! They used to have amazing hot salsa and for free. Will not be back. So long señorita!"}
{"text":"Great environment and awesome drink specials. Don't miss Sundays 3 dollar bloody marys and the best steak and egg tacos ever."}
{"text":"Second attempt, same result. Terrible service. Pathetic, cold, bland tacos for $3 each. Ran out of glasses and silverware. Air conditioning blasting directly on our table when it was only 75 degrees outside. So many better options nearby."}
{"text":"I've frequented Saltys on multiple occasions especially after spring training games. However the last two times have been there have been absolutely horrible. On one visit I paid with a credit card the transaction went thru and exactly two months later they tried to run charges for the exact same amount. My last visit this past weekend resulted in terrible service. Seemed like there was no communication between servers, kitchen staff or bus boys. None of the food came out right and when we sent it back someone else would bring it out 20 min later even though our server brought us the right food shortly after sending it back. Again there was an issue with the billing. Reluctant to use a credit card again we didn't have enough cash. After checking my bank account today Saltys changed the tip amount to increase the bill from $45 to $75. This place is shady as hell. If you do go here I would only pay in cash and I wouldn't go in with high hopes about the service!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my husband today.  Let me put it this way, we got our food and mine had to be sent back due to something being in my food(things happen).  My husband completed his meal and I waited as long as I could - 1/2 hour, but told them to box it up since I could not handle sitting there any longer.  Still waited. MOST IMPORTANTLY I would say that the service sucked, but I can not blame the servers.  They also had only one cook which was not enough for the few people that were ordering, making a very long wait. The food was just sitting on the pass thru as the servers weren't able to get to it.  Could not imagine if it was busier.  There was a manager/bartender on duty and think she was given this title so no one else would have to show up.  The place was severely under staffed.  Apparently someone had called in sick, which I know can happen.  When talking to the manager, I had made mention of how under staffed it was and she told me they were waiting for someone to show up.  They needed more then 1 more server to handle the place and it was not even full.  She also mentioned they had a GM and he was coming in later that night.  He should of been there then to cover.  This comes down to the owner that has no knowledge of what is going on or doesn't care.   GM- OWNER During the course of visit there were 25-30 people who left due to not being waited on.  I know because they all had to walk past us.  I think this is a shame since it money just walking out the door.  You can not blame the staff on duty as they were trying to get the people already there taken care of and that was even a struggle.  If you do not care about the place then close it down and let someone else take the opportunity to make worth going to."}
{"text":"Salty Señorita exceeded our expectations. We were here on a Friday night and got lucky with parking and our table.... No wait. Service with a smile and drinks and food were great. Fun relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great patio, ordered the spicy burger with ghost pepper sauce. It was under cooked and the bun was very soggy, flavor was good. Their jalapeño ranch with the fries was delicious. Chicken enchiladas were decent, the drink menu was mostly tequila based. Variety would be nice."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and this is a really fun place!  The drinks are kind of expensive for what they are(Malibu and Coke) but the enviroment is so fun and they play really great music! I wouldn't sit down and eat here since I have heard the service is god awful but drinks with the girls is A-OK!"}
{"text":"I just need to say, this place is unethical and dishonest. I went here with a friend a couple of nights ago and the waitress had gone out of her way to change my $10 tip into a $20 tip. I called the manager who admitted the tip had been scribbled out on the credit card slip and re-written. If I didn't catch it, the manager led me to believe that this was business as usual and would have gone unnoticed. This is a not a place I will ever return to and I advise you to be weary of taking your business here."}
{"text":"Salty Señorita went in yesterday at 3:10pm asked bartender young lady Markell for pinot gris she brought my glass of wine and asked if I was eating. I was, she handed me regular menu. I then had to ask if they had a happy hour (they do because my friend already told me how great the prices were) so she handed me the HH menu I ate and then the bartenders asked if I could check out..Sure enough she gave me the $10 glass of Coppola wine. I talked to Nick who took over for her. By the way he saved the day! But why would you not promote your HH especially now since it is the middle of summer and everyone is needing the business. I live in old town and have yet heard of another bar with $3 wine or well and $4 Margaritas. Get it together young lady and promote your happy hour!!"}
{"text":"This place was excellent! My husband and I went for Happy hour and we're very impressed. From their margaritas to their tacos everything was phenomenal. We also tried the guacamole and would definitely get it again."}
{"text":"Great place for sand volleyball play, but the service is HORRIBLE!  The servers don't come to you until you've been there 20 minutes, then they check on you every 30minutes if at all."}
{"text":"Ambiance is great and bar has a lot of potential.  What needs to be fixed is the level of service with ordering and bringing back food and drinks.  Takes too long for drinks orders and quite often we could not wait for our server and had to go to the bar ourselves (along with several other patrons).  I bet this place would make some serious cash if properly staffed.  The wait times is seriously something that needs to improve."}
{"text":"Great location in the Peoria Sports Complex. Kinda reminds me of a locals type beach bar and grill. Good happy hour food and drinks. Huge area with horseshoe pits, volleyball net and beanbag toss games. Fun place but beware lots of kids running around due to the young family draw of the baseball complex.  Only had hot wings (not very hot), cheese quesadilla and nachos with beers and margaritas. All just ok."}
{"text":"Not sure even where to start.   - Terrible service - Terrible margaritas  - Terrible tasting water - Micro size burritos,  - Rice and cheese filled tacos, no meat.   TOOK TWO HOURS TO GET OUR TERRIBLE FOOD, ON A TUESDAY NIGHT.   Go down the street to Diego Pops if you want a good Mexican food experience that is wallet friendly, that place is worth the wait. There's a reason this place doesn't have one."}
{"text":"Visited on Cinco De Mayo and the beer was warm and margaritas did not have any taste. Manager was more concerned about us being angry vs fixing our problem. Do yourself a favor and visit another place where they care about the customer and are prepared for a busy time."}
{"text":"Tasty drinks and friendly service! The street tacos (or baby tacos as my wife refers to them) were better than expected!  We will be back..."}
{"text":"We've been coming for years after spring training to get drinks and food. This year they have condensed their food menu and we do not like it one bit!!! We want the full menu!! We're let down we can't get our favorites that we come here for after a game! I just want nachos!!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok, but service with a smile is well worth the price of admission. Ask for Marisa I was impressed"}
{"text":"I am only giving this review 3 stars because of Matt. We waited at total of an hour and a half for service at the bar and the table, we actually never got service at the table for 20 minutes. That's when we decided to leave. We payed for bottomless mimosas and only got 2 for the hour and a half we were there. Matt took care of our tab, not expected but super appreciated. Thank you for making us actually want to come back just based on integrity of your restaurant. Much appreciated. They were also very under staffed and we get that so thank you for trying guys!"}
{"text":"This place is a dump. The seats, tables, decor are dusty. The food took very long time when they only have 3 tables in the whole restaurant. When the food arrived it wasn't very good and they even charge if you ask for extra sauce."}
{"text":"Dining is not a pleasant experience tonight. My order was for hamburgers and they did not have any hamburgers so I had to place my order three times to get it right.  It's a bit chilly because of the weather and it is cold inside the restaurant and you will  need to wear your jacket while you dine ."}
{"text":"The only thing going for Salty Senoritas is its location in Old Town Scottsdale. I've only eaten there once and left with a pricey stomach ache. Seems to be the trend at this restaurant. I'll take my Cinco de Mayo to Fox Restaurant Concepts, Blanco and enjoy great food in a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was amazing... went with a groupon coupon... service was amazing the guy actually was lively with us and kept a conversation... not to mention the food was delicious"}
{"text":"My Mom, my Uncle and I hit the Salty Senorita 2 days in a row!! The Beach House Nachos (with carnitas YUMMY!) are amazing! Obviously, since we had them both days! The layers and flavors are perfect together! We also got chicken tacos, carne asada tacos and tortilla soup (watch out, it has got a kick!). Everything was very tasty and the service was FANTASTIC!! A big Thank you to Sierra on day 1 and to Popeck (Pretty sure that is what the ticket said) on day 2! We will be back! Great job to the servers, bartender - excellent Margaritas and Bloody Marys! And to the Kitchen Staff - this is the kind of food folks dream about! I am a big fan of nachos with melted, shredded cheese, NOT cheese sauce! You nailed it! Thank you!"}
{"text":"So not feeling it. The drinks were watered down .. The food came out cold and one of my tacos fell on the table the waitress didn't even offer to replace it. So not worth it. Never coming again."}
{"text":"If I could give this place negative stars I would. Actually I will NEGATIVE FIVE STARS HAHAHA! The idea of the place sounds kind of cool, outside, beach theme with sand volleyball, it even has a tiny pond.  The only problem is that little pond is a mesquito cesspool and the sand gets every where, chip crumbs too, the place is kinda dirty. The drinks are average $8 price, dance floor sucks, their arent very many attractive women,  lots of old people:). Oh and the staff,  they were pretty busy so I understand, but one guy in particular was kind of rude and heres the kicker as i finished my drink that i ordered from him, I realized there was a HEAVY DUTY CONSTRUCTION STAPLE IN MY MOUTH!!seriously it was in my drink but, im such a lay back drunk tho i didnt even bother complaining because it just seems like something people do to like get free drinks and stuff.  Plus how would I really prove it. It was a black guy about 30 something years old that served me the drink not trying to be racist just warning people.  Luckily i wasnt hurt, and i guess it makes a moderately interesting story.  I wasnt being a douche or anything either I just came up and ordered my drink, he couldnt hear me and he asked again kind of frustrated with me and thats pretty much the exchange we had and then poof! STAPLE DRINK! Idk if it was on purpose but seems pretty wierd thing to show up in a drink accidently.  It was actually a little bit funny to me. Also this place is more bar than a restruant.  If you do decide to hit up Salty's ask them to hold the staples."}
{"text":"For what I experienced I would go back, I love these types of hangouts!  I was there for the 1St  West Valley Networking Mixer which will be held there monthly and I enjoyed myself and the event was a success.  The staff was right on top of service, the food looked good although I did not eat.  They have plenty to offer with what looks to be a nice menu so next time I'll plan ahead and try them out."}
{"text":"I came in for happy hour and ordered three tacos....a steak, chicken, & short rib. They were all delicious. Ben was the bartender who really did a great job. Great happy hour prices and an overall great experience, will definitely return"}
{"text":"Wow. Decent food with epically bad service. \"The kitchen's really backed up cuz we're really busy tonight\" does not constitute an apology for long waits, mixed up orders, and missing items. Good salsa, but the guacamole lacked both salt and acid. Tacos ordered with different proteins and garnishes were remarkably similar in taste and texture (though the Shrimp Shack taco, when it finally showed up, was very good).  By the way, \"really busy\" was a completely empty dining room and a patio with at least 1/3 empty tables.  Surely there is better food and better service in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The worst service I have ever had in my life. You need different servers that actually care about your customers. I will not ever be coming back to this bar."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch. Horrible service. Our waiter was apparently named \"the situation\"...I think he was either hung over or still drunk from the night before. Should've known when he told us \"he wasn't familiar with the menu\". Took almost hour n half to get food that was already cold, he \"forgot\" everything that we asked for, didn't know food was supposed to come with fruit ? (Says on the menu) so he opened a can of something and threw it in front if us after we were already finished eating, never got ketchup, got guac we ordered after we were done eating.  Got double charged for some items.  Totally ridiculous. Never going back there again to eat.  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"The nachos and guacamole were really good. It was different than the authentic mexican food I grew up with but overall it was all fresh amd flavorful. It was a good experience.  A twist on the traditional mexican."}
{"text":"Very slow service, food was ok taste but  was \"dry or over cooked\" I have tried them twice and the experience was the same. if you're a drinker you should be fine, nice atmosphere, feels similar to a rocky point hangout."}
{"text":"Probably had one of the worst experiences this past Friday evening. Was out with a few co workers after a Spring Training game, had been to Salty's when it was at it's previous location a block away and never really had a bad experience. Actually I worked at one of the hotels down the street and would recommend that guest would go there frequently. The new location is nice...bigger patio which was always an issue at the other location. Got to the restaurant around 8:45pm and placed my drink order, which I didn't get for another 20 minutes later. When our drinks finally got there we went ahead and put in our order for food, I ordered ceviche and my friends ordered tacos. 20 minutes passed by and I saw our server frequently check on the table across from us, never came to check on us. Another 10 minutes past same thing, finally an hour passes by and I went over to her to cancel our order. The manger came with our food, actually everyone's food except for mine...and told us he comped our food. Needless to say I will not be coming back here nor recommending it to my guest. Only reason they get a star is because I like the new location. Hopefully others have better experiences but from the other comments I see, they need a few months of customer service training for sure."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner here! The staff was excellent. Ashley , our waitress was one of, if not the best servers I ever had.. Friendly, personable, with a great sense of humor; took good care of us!"}
{"text":"The service was extremely slow. Even the bill took forever while our glasses were empty.  The burger was overcooked and overoaded with onions. At best it was poor bar food.  Atmosphere on the outdoor patio is good but some fans would help with the Arizona heat. A designated smoking area on the patio would allow all patrons to enjoy their food."}
{"text":"Dining at this restaurant was one of the worst experiences I have had. First, one of the people I was dining with had an entire margarita spilled down her entire back. While the waitress who spilled the margarita was sorry, there were no courtesies offered her way except for a t-shirt that my friend repeatedly said she did not want. Multiple people were served the wrong food, with slow service barely seeing the server. Another friend was served a vodka martini that tasted like tequila, and when she sent it back the bartender admitted to shaking her drink with a shaker that had tequila in it and did not rinse out. The bathrooms were absolutely filthy, and felt like a hazard to be in. When the check finally came my friend that had been sitting soaked in tequila from the spilled margarita did not have ANYTHING comped on her bill. When they asked to speak with the manager, the manager on duty, Jeremy, audibly argued with them about their bill, being SO RUDE. He blamed them for asking for a free shirt, which NEVER happened, and complained that they weren't charging her for the drink that was spilled on her (even though it was NOT her drink that the waitress spilled). His confrontation was so extremely uncomfortable, I am surprised he has made it to the management level in the service industry. I will absolutely never be seen in this establishment again, and I will make sure to let everyone I know hear of this experience. This restaurant is so poorly run, it should be a huge reflection of the awful management. To top off the atrocities of the evening, the basketball game that the majority of the restaurant was there to watch, shut off on the televisions with three seconds left in the game due to the carelessness and inattentiveness of the staff. Such an awful and unaccommodating experience."}
{"text":"Worst service. Had to ask for a server after 20 minutes of people walking by. They ran out of cholula, asked why we needed napkins and waters. Wouldn't recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"food = good service = nonexistent literally did not see our waitress still trying to flag someone down so we can pay and leave haha"}
{"text":"We live in Chicago and come to Scottsdale several times a year.  Salty has always been one of our favorites.  Love both the Old Town and Peoria locations.  This year' the Scottsdale location moved up the street.  We tried it when out there in January.  Definitely had some learning issues with the new staff and chef.  Not up to the usual standard that we fell in love with.  Went back this month (April) twice,  in hopes that they had worked out the kinks.  And they did.  From what I understand, new manager from when they first reopened and things were running much smoother.  Food was back to its yummy standard as well .  Love,  love,  love the pork tacos.  Food, service and ambiance all A+.  So glad they worked out the kinks.  We will definitely be back every time we are in town!!!!  Have read some of the earlier reviews.  You Might want to give it another shot too.  Think you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Minus a Star!!!!  Don't go.  I've seriously had better service and food quality at a 24 hour all you can eat road side Buffet.  The Servers are poorly trained and their are clearly not enough of them. Lastly, Salty's needs to go back to their old menu. Seriously is anybody going to Salty's expecting 5 Star dinning??? Just give me back my damn Jack Taco's. If I want fancy Mexican food....oh wait a minute,there's no such thing;)"}
{"text":"Um, to the guy that said Salty Señorita \"took over the old Monastery that closed down (you can see what they design if left on their own devices with their other location in Old Towne Scottsdale).......\" same owner. Yep, I'll say it again, SAME OWNER. He was having WAY more success with the Salty Señorita franchise than with the Monastery business, so he converted it. Learn a little something about a place before you talk shit."}
{"text":"I love the new look of Salty Señorita! Much better than the old location! Check out the tacoyaki table, the chef makes an awesome scallop taco!"}
{"text":"The last time I was in Saltys I had a great experience but yesterday was the complete opposite. I was stunned that they would let someone bartend who obviously probably never bartend before, the worst service I have ever had anywhere. Just because she's blonde young and cute is not  requirement, get it together Saltys! I gave you one star because I felt sorry for her."}
{"text":"Great patio and location.  We went just for drinks and sat at the bar. The bartenders were really nice and it was very comfortable and laid back."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars but yelp doesn't let you. Came here for lunch and the place was empty (2 other tables), should have taken the hint that this place has seriously gone downhill. Ordered the steak and avocado salad as usual and had to send it back it was so awful. Asked for a chicken taco instead and they gave me a beef taco. For $13 you can get a large tortilla covered in grease (which they call \"2 enchiladas\"). What a disappointment the entire meal was. So it you want horrible service, outdated decor, and overpriced, disgusting food -- then this place is for you. It's a shame, I  actually used to enjoy this place."}
{"text":"this place used to be fun, now all you get us over priced drinks that are watered down and poor service. I definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Great little bar and light Mexican food. I had the shrimp burrito bowl. It was very good. The service was spot on. I never ran dry."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a bite to eat and some coronas before a Giants game. I get that it was busy, but the service was terrible. The hostess was unprofessional and we had to flag our server down anytime we needed anything. Took her 20 minutes to even get us water.  The food was good (chips & salsa and tacos) also a good deal on the corona bucket (5 for $20) so I will probably be back. Hopefully they find new waitstaff in the mean time!"}
{"text":"3 Stars because the food (street tacos) was actually good. We wanted a fun meal before heading to the airport and instead ended up cutting it close. There were just too many problems with the service.   When we first arrived, we asked for a table on the patio because the weather was so nice. Unfortunately, we got an area that didn't have umbrellas. After asking for one, our waitress came back to tell us they were still ordering more fixtures like umbrellas because they only opened two weeks ago. Seems like something you get a hold on before opening.   Then we proceeded to order and the waitress informed us they were out of some menu items. She only replied with, \"Sorry, the hostess should have told you.\" Well, she didn't.   When the food finally came it was great. The  short rib tacos and maple jalepeno tacos were fantastic.  It took quite a while for the waitress to get back to us during the meal and after for our check. She even mentioned that she didn't even notice we had gotten our food. That was weird. But glad they at least got something right."}
{"text":"Extremely underwhelming experience. Drinks, appetizers, and entrees took forever.. And on a Tuesday night. Everything was painfully salty, very true to the name. Pretty overpriced for such a mediocre dining experience."}
{"text":"I love going to salty's because it is a great environment where I get the opportunity to relax and have fun with friends.  However, last Saturday, while celebrating a friends birthday, our table got cussed out by our waitress for others who had left earlier not tipping her.  NOT MY PROBLEM!b literally, could not believed she cussed us out not once but twice about someone else OBVIOUSLY showing their disdain with her service.  Whoever goes to salty's..beware of Alyse.  She's a nightmare of a waitress"}
{"text":"I want to start by saying, the atmosphere at this place was amazing. They had a really cool indoor/outdoor bar that I could see myself sitting at on a nice night and having a few drinks.   On this visit we sat inside at a high top table with a party of 5. We came here for our taco Tuesday tradition. They had two dollar tacos and some drink specials. Our server started out very attentive, but it seemed to decrease as the time passed. A couple times she had a little girl following her around that might have been her kid or something. She would periodically sit down at a table with what looked like grandma, and then start following our server around from table to table. It was definitely distracting her, and when she would check up on us we would be on the middle of a request and she would have to stop to address the little girls question. So that kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I was definitely happy when her shift was up and we got a new server who was much more focused.   We ordered chips and salsa for the table, and all 5 of us ordered tacos, as per tradition. I didn't mind the salsa but the general consensus for the table was negative. The only tacos available for the special were chicken and steak. Both meats are cooked in a sauce and served on a soft flour tortilla with pico de gallo and cheese. We ordered a total of twelve tacos, and when they arrived we were missing a few and our plates were all mixed up. Not a big deal, but it was another server error. The steak was good, but the chicken was delicious. The sauce on it was kind of cheesy, and it had sort of a spicy kick. The tacos were stuffed full, which I love sense it was such a good value. Overall I enjoyed my meal.  I gave three stars mostly because of the service. However it won't stop me from returning. I would definitely recommend this place on a nice night for some drinks on the outside bar."}
{"text":"Positives of this restaurant: It had a beautiful patio, food was good, and margaritas were great. Other than that, I'm not impressed. We were seated on the patio and didn't get acknowledged by a waitress till we had been sitting there for over ten minutes. Margaritas took quite a while to come out. Our food actually came out before we got our first round of drinks. The waitress also forgot to even bring out the child's meal we had ordered. She was very apologetic and said she would take our margaritas off the check. Our waitress came back and said she wasn't able to do that, so we got a card for a free appetizer. Yippee. Even though we enjoyed the food I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone until they figure out how to serve tables properly."}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Good drinks, good appetizers, great prices. We got the house happy hour margarita on the rocks, nachos and cheese crisp. Our server was fun and attentive. Definitely will be back for happy hour soon."}
{"text":"We went after receiving a 'dealchicken' coupon.  The atmosphere was very fun and looked like it could be a great place to hang out. The food however, was just ok.  We had ordered the fandingo cheese dip, the chicken wings, and the 6 taco sampler platter. The only thing I would recommend would be the chicken wings. Very crispy, a good size, and a nice bite to them, although I wouldn't call them 'hot'.  The fandingo cheese dip tasted like melted queso velveeta.  We were given dirty silverware, which they did replace. The cheesedip wasn't  delivered with any kind of spoon, and the container was too hot to pick up and pour on a plate, so that was a little difficult too. All in all, I would go back for drinks, but not for a meal."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time but hadn't been there in awhile except for a few days ago, in which I received the best service I've ever gotten there. My and my friends were taken care of so well. The bartender was fast with our drinks, our food was so good!! But the best part was the manager, Charles who was amazing! Nice big warm welcome. Really helped out his staff and just showed he really cares about this place. Because of him I'll returning much more often now!"}
{"text":"Food is OK, tho they were busy so it took nearly an hour and a half to get it.  Their security guys are complete aggro d*cks tho.   A friend tripped on the sidewalk and they \"asked\" him to leave for too many drinks.  Not really, they rough housed him out immediately and looked like they were trying to get him to start a fight with the 3 of them.    Bright side is our 20 person group can go somewhere else next year for the get together.  I'm sure we can get $4 bottles of domestic beer about anywhere."}
{"text":"These guys are now open for Sunday brunch!  I must say it was a great experience. The build your own Bloody Mary Bar was amazing! They have more goodies than you can imagine. I thoroughly enjoyed it (only 5 bucks). The breakfast burritos were very good as were the chorizo and egg tortas with avocado. I had been here a couple times early on and had less than perfect experiences. I'm soooo glad I gave them another chance. Service was great too. This is our new Sunday spot. I will also try them for dinner again in hopes I will have a similar experience. I should have taken a picture of the Bloody Mary bar. It was impressive. I will next time."}
{"text":"Our company Christian Brothers AC, Plumbing, & Electrical just had our Christmas party here the general manager Charles Tansey was so wonderful he was there from the beginning helping me plan the menu for 70 people he made sure we had enough tables reserved the food was on time and fantastic everyone said the food was so good we ordered taquitos quesadillas, mini chimi's chicken and beef, tacos chicken and beef rice and beans yum! All of the food was good.  They had plenty of heaters so no one was cold.  The wait staff was good they made sure everyone was happy and had enough to drink.  We plan to do our next event there I would highly recommend them for your next company event or if you want to have drinks and dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  In town for a friends wedding and Patrick the Manager and staff were great!  Went there 4 days in a row and had a blast!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've never expected much from salty the food has always been subpar and the wait staff inexperienced.  But, tonight was a new low.. I went for a couple of beers and food - omg the OUTSIDE bar smelled so bad I lost my appetite. Worrying about food safety I closed my tab. $5 for a corona? Really??? I have no problem paying but when your bar smells (so so bad) and your food sucks  I can't justify spending one more second here. A miserable experience.  YUCK!!! STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress was incredibly rude. \"Tableside\" guacamole included her smashing a fork into the avocado about 5 times and walking away. Charged us extra for the \"bottomless\" chips and salsa. Will not be going back again."}
{"text":"10 minutes in asked a server to call our server over.  27 minutes to get a glass of water...still waiting on margarita. Will update if still alive.  Update: 30 minutes, margarita arrived. Sweet, but only $4."}
{"text":"This is not the place to go for food. Everything on the menu is the same just wrapped up in a different package with no flavor or sauces. Nice patio for sippin watery margaritas."}
{"text":"Can't give it any less. Very disorganized, poorly run,kids and alcohol everywhere. Worst service I have ever had. Slow and I mean SLOW.  Not to mention the ants all over the table."}
{"text":"Honestly I would never take it this far but this needs to be said. We came in on a Saturday night and YES it's spring training and YES it's busy but the treatment and the service we got was unacceptable the server was clearly flustered from the beginning. We didn't have enough chairs for the table so we asked for some and she said \"you can find your own\" which we thought she was joking but she wasn't. We had a big party but mostly couples so everyone was going to be splitting checks she never asked if they were split which would be the first thing you should ask with a big party. Then she would put things down and just throw them in front of us like it was an in convince to her.  Which it is her job. Then when the bill came it was not split and it was not clear that it needed to be said to split it. we asked nicely to have her split the bill by telling her exactly what was on each bill. She said that was too much and asked us to calculate the tabs ourselves. Then she pulled the manager over who was just as unhelpful!!! I'm sorry but as someone who has worked in customer service it's completely unfair to just put things on the customer to \"figure out.\" The food was good but the service was so bad that we will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"This is a very fun atmosphere, but it is WAY too loud. We ordered the Beach house nachos and they were wonderful. The service was good and we enjoyed it, but the music needs to be a little lower."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place almost every weekend and it used to be packed.   The past few times I've been there the mood wasn't great but I thought it must have just been an off night.  When I pulled up tonight there were barely any cars in the parking lot.  I walked in to remixed rock music playing, and a few tables with passed out drunk people sleeping. This was at 10.30 pm! I could not believe how dead the place was.   The bathrooms have always needed major attention, yet years later the same stalls are still shut down, leaving the remaining ones overflowing as usual.  The reason why we finally left 1 1/2 hours later was the service. Or the lack thereof. Two waitresses were hanging out 10 feet away from us, chatting, texting,  avoiding eye contact. They frequently walked past us, immediately reverting their eyes as soon as they accidentally made eye contact. We did see them serve a table with a few guys. I guess their motto is \"No shlong, no service\". All we wanted was a beer and some chips and salsa, but were unable to get any service. We left promising that we will not return.  SALT Y'S: please apply for \"Bar Rescue\"! It's too nice of a location to let it go to crap. We were very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is pretty damn ghetto. They had to break up a fight around 11pm and there's only about 25 people here. I'm also looking at a girl who's basically nodding off at a table, and it doesn't seem like it's from alcohol if you ask me....  Server was alright, they were out of 3 types of tacos as well as sour cream, which is pretty strange for a Friday night. Service was a little slow for a weekend night.  We had a good time due to the company we were with but we probably won't be coming back for the next girls night."}
{"text":"Nothing bad about this place and nothing all that special either. They have a huge patio and outdoor bar, which is what I liked about it the most."}
{"text":"Despite being nearly empty, the service was incredibly slow. Ok, so maybe we just got the one bad waitress. But the food was really overpriced and not that great. I ended up sending my meal back, something which I haven't done in years. There's better food for half the price elsewhere. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went to the Salty Senorita for after dinner drinks.  I was with my wife and a friend. We waited for about 10 minutes for a waitress and decided to order our drinks from the bartender. The drinks were great. Excellent Margaritas. Waitress did finally come by and asked if we wanted food and we declined. Never saw her again. We did end up having to go back to the bartender for another round. It leaves no imagination as to why there were so many empty tables there on a Saturday evening. I guess everyone else knew what I no know. You go there for the drinks and you will not be disappointed as long as you do not expect much service. I'll bet the waitress doesn't understand why her tips are so low!"}
{"text":"I came here at night with some friends and was overcharged by 10 dollars.  I called and asked them to look into this and heard nothing back from them.  I will not be going back."}
{"text":"So.. I read the reviews beforehand and was anticipating mediocre service and poor food.  Unfortunately i was not dissapointed. I walked in and greeted by two security people who asked to see my ID. Walking past them i entered and area with tables with an open view of the kitchen. There was a waitress seating on one of the tables and she greeted me while seating. I asked if i could sit at the bar and order food. She said yes. When I sat at the Bar i asked for the Menu and the bartender mentioned that food was not available at the bar only the tables. I was given a menu and I picked a table. Because I picked a table maybe to far from the view of the waiters I moved to a location in plain view of everyone.  NO DICE!  It's been 25 minutes, I Am not kidding! This is the place where no one cares. I was really rooting for you Salty.... I was hungry for some tacos and a beer. Thats ok, there's a red robin close by. Oh, and if the people from this bar are reading this, you should really fix the table that wobbles about 20 inches to one side."}
{"text":"So after a 7 year gap between visits, salty hasn't hardly changed all that much. Patio, bar, and firepit all still the same. But not all that bad though, had lunch today on the decently sized outdoor tables.   Today was their 6 combination taco platter for 17 bucks. Not too outrageous because you get to pick and choose which of their tacos you want instead of 6tired of the same ones. Washed them down with a fair tasting margarita on the rocks, tasty but seemed like grocery store margarita mix.   I do disagree with paying for a chips and salsa, most all mexican theme remstaurants offer free chips and salsa. Didn't quite make for happy hour so drinks weren't as inexpensive as expected. Not a bad place for mexican, but anyone should still read reviews before stopping in."}
{"text":"Great new building, same sh*t service and food. Go there for drinks but not if you're hungry. 'Nough said."}
{"text":"Went for drinks and appetizers with very large group in February. They knew we were coming.   The waitress was so attentive and nice, so I gave three stars.   Appetizers were very good and drinks were just okay.  Maybe if I ate some real food here I would have given it  more.    The building is very run down though.  We sat outside and were bothered by birds wanting food the whole time.  Sort of charming at first, but they were persistent.  And I sat by this fence with a weird little alley on the other side...sort of creepy. Worth a shot if you are close by."}
{"text":"Fish tacos are grand. Beer is cold. Crowd is chill. Staff is attentive."}
{"text":"First time horrible service left after 15mins because no one would come to our table. Second time better service but i would only order drinks tacos are kind of a rip off. Good place to be outside and play yard games."}
{"text":"Inconsistent! I like to bring clients here for a good margarita and some decent apps. Service was great but I only go when I know Elizabeth is working. I decided to try the Sunday brunch and WOW! what a disappointing experience. We ordered from the brunch menu and the regular menu. Elizabeth suggested the tostadas from the brunch menu and it came out soggy. The tacos we ordered were dry and had no flavor. Come on guys...get it together!!! I know this place has potential. OH! and one more minus...the restaurant has no air conditioning! Our poor server was melting before our eyes and it was so uncomfortably warm that it was near impossible to eat. Get some air flow in there!!"}
{"text":"Before we even had menus the tables were soooo dirty I had to ask for a warm rag to clean it! And I am serious when I say go pee in the bush because it is it is probably safer than the women's rest rooms!!! No kidding I was actually kinda scared to be in the restroom... There is a pond out front full of stagnant water and it smells... I should have ran then!!! No kidding, hands down, maybe the WORST food.... all around, that I have EVER tasted! The  the chicken was some kind of marinated craziness, and because we  were all hungry (and there was 8 of us) we ordered nachos and carnitas tacos too.. Im pretty sure the ground beef  they use on the nachos is some sort of canned meat-like substance... but most definitely sure its NOT MEAT! The carne asada tacos have a weird brown soupy kinda stuff...( should have  taken a pic of this bad boy!) Then when the waitress comes around to pick up all of the UNEATEN food plates she asks \"was everything ok? (obviously not 30 minutes later and the plates are still full of food) and then proceeds to tell us if we complain or have the nastiness taken off the bill she will have to pay for it out of her TIPS!!! Now explain to me how its her fault that the food sucks!!! So I paid the whole 160.00 bill... I tipped her 40.00 and came home to write this review! DO NOT... I MEAN DOOOO NOT waste your $$$ or time ... oh and last but not least... my tummy is upset from the few tastes I had!!!"}
{"text":"Good vibe on the patio, shitty service, great happy hour. Simple review for a simple bar. I wouldn't go here if I wasn't meeting someone who picked this place. Okay spot just not the best."}
{"text":"The patio is super nice and spacey if the weather is great out definitely sit outside. I got the ceviche and it sucked. Basically two pieces of shrimp and a crap load of pico and avocado... All for a whopping 13$ or something like that. Bloody Mary bar was the only thing that would maybe get me to go back... But probably not. Super clean though, and okay service."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's never failed to please my taco and beer cravings. Was recently just suggested the fish tacos and offered the negra modelo draft which I didn't know existed! Great food and service from Jeremy and Ben, il be back."}
{"text":"The service was ok .. The food never eating here again.. Shared 6 tacos all different kids none where good! Guac was alright not something I will order again !"}
{"text":"Awesomeness, Derrick, are bartender, took great care of us and was super chill and makes the best green tea shots,have to try the carne Asada breakfast tacos. Place packed with eye candy."}
{"text":"So Nicole was ridiculously amazing... Good personality and attentive .. Great new place"}
{"text":"This place is what it is.  Uneven service (we had the best and worst waitresses I've ever had, in one night), uneven and mediocre food, and so-so mixed drinks.  But, there is something alluring about the extremely laid back atmosphere and nice setting.  It's as if you stumbled into a somewhat dumpy, but still very fun joint in Rocky Point.  Yes, I felt obligated to give it two starts based on the fundamentals, but the proof is in the pudding; we stayed for five hours last night!  So, something is right!  The volleyball aspect is nice, but there is only one court now, so be sure to call ahead.  There is some league activity that takes over that court for multiple weeknights.     Would I recommend S.S?  No (Yes).  :)"}
{"text":"Ran out of water. Ran out of the bottomless chips. Server never came back, bartender had to track her down so I could pay. Totally forgot about me. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I have never had such bad food before! I went there with a group of 5 for brunch on Saturday. The wait was too long at RnR so we decided to give Saltys a go. The service was good and the menu looked great. We ordered drinks and things were going well. At this time we were starving so we all ordered off the breakfast menu. When our food arrived there was something wrong/missing from all our plates. Three of us were missing potatoes, there was one plate missing bacon, one person had a hair in their food, two people were missing salsa/cream/avocado. When the server finally checked in us we were pretty much done eating. Oh and how do you mess up eggs!!! We order sunny side up and over medium and the yokes were COMPLETELY cooked through!!! Our bill came for over $100 and we paid and got out of there still hungry and upset. Things I would improve; I'm not saying we needed our meals comped but there was completely no empathy and no effort to make things right. Don't go expecting good food or quality service. Next time we will make sure and wait."}
{"text":"Living in the Peoria area I have been here numerous times. Great outdoor bar! They have a fairly decent happy hour. The atmosphere is always fun. You can watch spring training games right from the sand! We went here last night for my son's girlfriends 21st Birthday. They had a DJ and $5 Coronitas buckets. Our server was Briana and she was great! Very friendly and attentive. In fact the whole staff was attentive to our party of 5. Even when my son spilt his drink it was immediately cleaned up and a new one was brought right over! Several employees wished our birthday girl happy birthday. Tacos are good and I like their chicken tortilla soup also. Thanks Briana for great service last night!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten unbearable, made reservation and they said we didn't have one when we got there with our 12 friends, service is horrible, the bean bag game was missing bags \"seriously new bags are only $10\", then we switched to horse shoes well that was impossible because the tree was hanging over the pit \"landscape people\" and the sound system was a joke. Seriously people spend some money and clean the place up"}
{"text":"Great place for a drink and just relaxing. Love the atmosphere and some off the service. Some of the servers are a little snooty but other then that it's a great little place. Tried a few items on the menu and loved it."}
{"text":"We came around 9pm on a Tuesday, ate some $2 tacos and drank 2 pitchers of margaritas! Great outdoor patio, very loud music/party scene. Really good chips and salsa too!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday evening with 7 people (hours after a spring training game).  Waited approx 20 minutes before 2 of us went to the bar ourselves and got our drinks.  Mentioned to the bartender we had no service and he just laughed.  We had to wait another 20+ minutes and then I found a server, Mackenzie, who said she would find someone to help us, but still no one came AGAIN/STILL!!!  We were going to leave, but I decided to call the restaurant from our table and asked to speak with the manager, Charles.  When I saw who the manager was, I got him to come to our table and told him what was going on.  He said he would \"take care of us\" and found us a server, Mackenzie, even though that was not her area to serve.  She gave us good service and Charles also checked with us a few more times to ask how we were doing.  We received our food in good time (shocker), but when we asked for silverware, the gal who brought our food (not Mackenzie), could only find 3 sets.  REALLY????  We asked if they ran out and she said no, but she just couldn't find any.   Meal was good (which is what we heard and the only reason why we stayed), but when it came time to pay and we asked for the check, we were \"taken care of\" by being comped 1 beer (the cheap one) of $3.00!!!!!  We left a very generous 20% tip and I asked Mackenzie if that was really all they were going to comp us with what we just went through.  She said that it was the $3.00 beer and I said I wanted to talk with Charles, but she said he had left because they ran out of coffee!!!    This place has TERRIBLE SERVICE and even though the food was decent and even though I found the manager, Charles, for some assistance, it's just not worth it to go here for the aggravation.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you have lots of time.  And I am surprised the M's could broadcast from here to promote this place.  If I could find a way to let the M's organization know how terrible this place/customer service is, I would."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! First of all, what Mexican restaurant charges for chips and salsa?! Second, the place was so loud I couldn't hear myself think. Our server acted like she didn't want to be there. The food server brought the food and quickly spun around without asking if we needed anything else...and even worse, pretended not to hear me when I tried to let him know we didn't even have silverware to eat our food with. My daughter is a server so I would never not tip because I know they're dependent on tips for income...but I was very tempted to leave a nasty note instead of a tip for the first time ever. Food was bland...nothing special. I don't know what the draw to his place is (it was busy when we were there) but I will never go back."}
{"text":"We ate outside.  The service was good, but the meat in EVERY taco was horribly salty.  By that I mean it was so salty that it overpowered the rest of each taco.  The appetizers were good.  They just need more QC in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Food is always great except during spring training when they go to an abbreviated menu. I understand why, but maybe a secret \"locals only\" menu where we can still get our favorites. The servers need a bit of polishing...a long wait sometimes between refills and a lot of chatting/texting. But they are always friendly, so I won't complain too much."}
{"text":"I only left one star, because there isn't an option to leave ZERO stars.    Salty's sold out. This place is nothing like the old restaurant - Bad service and terrible food! Don't waste your time or your money.   They spent a ton of money on a new building, but I guess their new budget didn't include trained servers or a kitchen crew.   We boarder Mexico!! How difficult is it to construct a taco??   #Suckyseñorita"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place to drink and have fun! It can get pretty packed but sometimes that's a good thing, especially if you don't mind dancing with people! There is so many different sections for games and they have so much room for a good 10 people so you're not crammed while someone is taking their turn."}
{"text":"Service is awful. Our server Justin was rude and kept blaming that it was busy on the bad service. I get that it's spring training, expect to be busy. Hire more servers that smile. A busy kitchen doesn't mean the service should be bad."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is the best time to go.  Margaritas are very good.  Service is okay.  There's a very nice, big patio to enjoy."}
{"text":"Summary: Terrible service, blah food, slow, on a night with 1/3 of their seating taken.   This place WAS my favorite place for Tacos in Scottsdale, last night I took my friends who were out of town here. They were apprehensive of my decision bc they had gone the night before and a server never came to their table, after 15 mins they left. I'm not sure what's happened at Salty but there were multiple empty tables that the hostess couldn't seat us bc she had to buss them first (why is your only hostess bussing tables). We had to wait at least 10 mins on our waitress to show up, the margaritas were hand squeezed in Mexico, I know this because they took as long as the drive time to the border to arrive, and they weren't even delivered by our waitress, this other woman just put all 5 on the table between 2 of us and turned around and walked away, very weird, our food took longer, we joked with the waitress that we had heard one of the cooks had died in the kitchen, that went over her head. By this time we had been people watching enough that we noticed that every table around is was complaining.   Finally, our food came, our drinks were empty and once again, some guy who we had not seen all night delivered our food (where was our waitress?), the tacos were not on par with what I had promised my friends, we also had to go steal a stack of napkins and silver ware from behind the bar, we couldn't ask the bar tender bc he didn't even notice us waiting.   Lastly our bills, we waited 30 mins for them after asking for them, 2 stops from the manager, which we obviously complained, just like the 2 other tables next to us, another 10 mins past they finally came, they were messed up, it took another 10 mins for them to come back, and to top it off I didn't have cash so I gave the waitress my card, this took another 7 mins. I know the times bc this got so comical that we started a timer and started betting on the over under of how long each trip would take.   All in all we walked in at 7:55, got a margarita and Tacos, and were finally released from being held hostage at 10:20 pm. Completely unacceptable.   The waitress did relay that The manager  offered us a discount on our next visit, which he couldn't give on this visit, and he was some how going to remember us from this visit. Bone head!   What has happened to my favorite place?!"}
{"text":"They had good happy hour prices but we had horrible service. Nachos were good but tacos were bland. We waited over 20 minutes for our bill. A table next to us got up and left cause it took them so long to get service. Our waitress Leila apologized multiple times but it didn't seem like she was that busy. Not how I was to spend date night when paying for a babysitter. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Outstanding.... Guacamole exceptional! Fajitas combo the same.... Two shared this and were completely full. Done n done! Cali central coast gal"}
{"text":"The best freak'n tacos I've had in my entire Mexican life. NO JOKE! I had the blackened fish taco and the carne asada taco. Both were delicious. Chips and salsa were great too. Outdoor seating on an Arizona hot night? NO problem because they have outdoor coolers that make it a great night.  Love this place. You will too."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks , but horrible service. Went for lunch sat outside and waited 10 min before our waiter asked if we wanted anything to drink. Only came twice to  check on us. Had to wave her down decided to leave & asked our check. Would have spent a lot more on drinks had she asked .  Sweet girl, not sure if they were just short staffed that day or what."}
{"text":"Oh what can I say? My boyfriend and I were in town visiting from L.A. when we stumbled upon this place. We had just driven down from the Grand Canyon and Sedona and boy were we hungry! What initially caught our eye was the fun outdoor patio/bar setting so we decided to stop and see what this place had to offer. As soon as we walked in we were greeted in a very welcoming way and our server came to our table instantly. She right away made suggestions to us and we decided on the Nachos and the Grilled Shrimp tacos. Oh My God!!!! I had never had nachos that tasted soo good! Now I'm back home in L.A. and I keep telling my boyfriend that we HAVE to go back for those nachos because I'm seriously salivating for them!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Guacamole- ever! Freshly made, you can taste the fresh ingredients and there's no overpowering spice that keeps you from enjoying it to the last bite! Yum!! Thanks Leia for an awesome experience!!!  You definitely make the best guac!! You rock!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the service is usually alright... It's been a few months since I had been so I decided to go for taco Tuesday. The service was absolutely horrible. One of the waitresses that I like to call little bitch kept walking right past us & continued to ask people who got there after us what she could do to help them... To describe her- she had short blonde hair with a half sleeve colored tattoo on her left arm. We waited for what felt like forever until someone approached us. Who happened to be Madisen who by the way was fantastic. If it wasn't for her I definitely would have given one star if even that. Seriously though she is the waitress to ask for. Screw the rest."}
{"text":"Let me just say this: if it weren't for a few little things, I'd probably give this place four stars. But for now, after my initial visit, it's a pretty solid three stars and a big ol' thumbs up for the tasty food.  It was difficult getting to this place, so I understand why the Groupon is out there; it's a great way to get people motivated to visit. The restaurant seems really tucked away, but since it's so close to the baseball fields, I'm assuming it can get a bit more crowded when there's ball being played. We laughed at the cute signs in the parking lot nudging people further in towards the entrance.  We weren't really greeted by the waitress - it seemed like their staff was just sitting around, waiting for people to come in - but she was nice and did a decent job, though her attitude was very casual and she seemed like she didn't care all too much. It would be another story if her nonchalant attitude actually got in the way of service, but there were no problems.  We ordered a few house margaritas and they were okay. Not great. I didn't expect them to be great and half-off is half-off, so why not?  I ordered the Shrimp & Cheese Quesadilla and a cup of Creamy Poblano Soup. When the soup came out, it was quite a surprise to see how very big the portion was! It was definitely more like a bowl. I ended up taking home half of the quesadilla because there was so much soup and the quesadilla was pretty big, too.  I liked the food, but it's definitely not health food - at least not the items I ordered. My parents each ordered a burrito and my dad was a big fan of his while my mother wasn't so sure about hers. Honestly I think she was just being picky because I thought all of the food was tasty.  The little things that bugged me were minor points individually but together take off a star. The many flies at the restaurant bugged me and were annoying. I don't like when sit-down Mexican restaurants charge for chips and salsa, either; that should be a freebie, especially if you are light on the sides that come with entrees. Those factors, plus the nonchalant waitress and the meh margarita make me a little less inclined to give a higher rating. Furthermore, the music was too loud. Just a notch down would've been a great improvement.  I would still go back, though, as some of their menu items really look good (oh, I wish I'd tried the fajitas!). The decor is really neat, too, and I'd love to go when the place is hopping."}
{"text":"Nothing to hate on here, except the prices have increased on a lot of the food.  Food is very good but some portioning (tacos, esp) seemed quite paltry for the $.  Our server was very quick and on the ball with a total of 9 people, all of which required separate bills.    Not on the menu is the $2 bottomless chips and salsa...ask for it and they still offer it!  Woohoo!  Gone are the buckets o' beer...quite a shame, but Coors / Coors Light are $2 on happy hour.    The ladies restroom, curiously, was in very poor shape.  One toilet was leaking all over the floor.  Two (of 4) stalls didn't have the door locking mechanism.  How is this OK or possible for a new place?  Will I be back?  YES. I love a good patio and bottomless chips and salsa and friendly service is enough to get me back.  Was the old Salty's better?  YES..."}
{"text":"Heard this was a good place for after ball game, or anytime for that matter.  prior to going to Cactus League game checked their website. They advertise daily happy hour  with $4 Margaritas + $3 well drinks, among other offers.   My Margarita was $7 & well was $6. When I questioned this was told that during March no happy hour due to ball games as people still come in & that their website means nothing. Great location, poor help, poor service & FALSE advertising. Wont go back!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place to hang out with friends and have a drink if you're willing to wait.  I've been there when the place was dead and when packed; either way, I have had to wait a lenghty period of time to have a waitress come take a drink order, and then wait a long time to get the drink, and then wait longer just to have my order taken.     The atmosphere is fun, and on some nights they have live music, but plan on waiting for service or just get the beer yourself from the bar."}
{"text":"Came here last night with my bf and his friend who was in town visiting. We all ordered margaritas and wow were they awesome!!! We ordered several tacos which were just ok. I got a burrito bowl which was really good...we will prob come back but just for the drinks."}
{"text":"We tried this place out last year for spring training and service sucked. Drinks were good, food was good, environment was GREAT, lawn games, tons of seating, just an all around cool place. We weren't happy with our experience, but knew it had potential. Our only complaint was the waitress, so we figured this year we would try it out again. Tonight the restaurant was busy, but not packed. The waitresses were running around like it was their first day and seemed to have no clue what was going on. We weren't starving, so we were ok with waiting for our food. The waitress came back several times saying \"im sorry, im sorry, the cooks are busy, its just soo busy!\" It took us over an hour to get our food and we had only ordered tacos (it was taco tuesday) and two easy appetizers. The only thing that tasted good was the chicken tacos. The few of us who ordered steak could barely chew through the chunks of meat and even had to spit some out. My taquitos had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time, my guacamole even had a nice brown crust.  After we ate the waitress came out and basically bad mouthed the restaurant saying she would hurry out too \"longest wait ever\", when it was obvious that most of the negatives  we her fault (the people around us had a different waitress, larger groups, and still got food 30 minutes before us). Not professional at all. Its too bad, this place could be really awesome, we would probably go back most nights of our trip, but their staff sucks! I've never written a review before, but this experience compelled me to. Thanks saltys!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday for Cinco de mayo and had the best service I've had on such a busy day Leia was great she was slammed but somehow was able to always make sure we were taken care of we will be back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in because it looked busy when driving by so we thought it had to be good, right? Wrong! We ordered the house margarita and their version of a Cadillac margarita and both were watered down. The nachos were different, I think I just wasn't a fan of the cheese. Asked for jalapeños and got raw jalapeños, weird for nachos. We also ordered their Ceviche and it was ok, but again weird it came with lettuce instead of chips or at least saltines. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Ok place, Ok food. Friendly attentive waitress. Will visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"Come for the bad food, stay for the horrible service.  Actually, to be fair, the torta and the nachos were delicious and are why this place gets 2 stars instead of just 1.  Everything else though, including carnitas, short rib, octopus and chicken tacos; just... not good.  The margarita was also less than desirable.  Top it off with a brutal live music act and all in all this was just a bad experience."}
{"text":"Good happy hour with reasonable entree and drink prices. The tacos are a la carte and very cheap. I recommend the carnitas tacos.. Back porch awesome in cool season as well!"}
{"text":"The food is ok. The tacos were overpriced and average. Our server recommend 2-3 tacos per person, and I ordered two, since I usually can't finish an entree at a restaurant. Two tacos were not enough to fill me up, which was surprising giving the price and the suggestion from the server. The service was pretty slow, and it took a long time to get our food, and an even longer time to get our check and pay. It seemed like there were not enough servers to go around. This place is not really worth a return trip back."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Great outdoor patio and wait staff. The tacos were perfectly prepared and the fajita bowl my boyfriend got was \"one of the better bowls he's had\".  The fajita bowl chicken was perfectly seasoned and grilled! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Bad service from scantily-clad college girls-- but I guess that's what some people come here for. The food is nothing special. There are better places very close by."}
{"text":"I had dinner here the other night with a group for my friends birthday, our servers name was Lindsay with an A Y. She's a badass server, probably the most badass in old town or the world. To be honest I was pretty hammered so I don't remember much but I do remember the badassness of our server Lindsay with an A Y. They should honestly fire all the other servers and give her all the tables. You're badass Lindsay, I will definitely be dining here again!"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night, and it was perfect. In town for business and never heard of this place, but looked good. I got 3 assorted tacos, meat was so tender with spice but not hot, chicken Tinga taco is my favorite. My buddy got a burrito and said it was excellent. Our waitress, Taylor, was great, suggested the bacon guacamole, and it was so good. We ordered margaritas and they were perfect, right amount of alcohol. Will definitely be back next time in town."}
{"text":"My friend from Glendale took me and my boyfriend here for dinner our first night visiting Arizona. She said they usually go here for a night out rather than for meals, but thought it would suffice for a quick mexican dinner. Well, she was right. The interior is exactly your typical mexican eatery with walls covered in random stuff and bright colors everywhere. The outdoor patio looked really cool, but it was so hot when we went, we sat indoors. The waitress we had was nice enough, but she didn't seem to know the menu very well because when I asked how large the tacos were in the happy hour special, she said they were very filling and it would be enough for my meal.... right. When I got my tacos they were two taco-truck sized tacos, and we all actually laughed about my two tiny tacos compared to what my dining partners ordered: one monstrous taco salad and one huge quesadilla. At least their portions were large enough that after I devoured my tacos in about 3 minutes, I got to help them finish their food. Overall, the food wasn't bad. A step up from fast food mexican (a la taco bell or chipotle) I'd say. The chips and salsa were pretty boring and still cost us $2, so pass on those. The meal in and of itself was pretty cheap and it was a good enough time to sit and chat without being bothered too much by the waitress."}
{"text":"It was alright, nothing spectacular though.  Good outdoor area, drinks were not anything special, margaritas were straight from a mix.  I'd come again but only if someone else choose it."}
{"text":"After seeing the bad reviews on poor service we decided to still go in since it was national margarita day. But anyone wants a pitcher of ice with their margarita they should come here! We spent $64 on 2 pitchers and didn't even get a buzz and there was only two of us. Awful service (I'll say it again) sadly, not worth coming here. :("}
{"text":"OMG.....we came here again because our friends are STRONG supporters of the Scottsdale location and they refused to believe us on just how horrible this place is!  We walk in and the smell is like a punch in the face!  C'mon man this is winter it shouldn't smell this ba d unless you REALLY have problems!  The wife and I sat back and let them take lead...they let the waitress know how they were regulars over in Scottsdale and she almost had a sneer on her face but we got out drinks and they were appalled! The Marguerita he ordered was undrinkable and that's his fave....the waitress said, \"that's how we make them here\"....WHAT????  We will not be back nor our friends....they had to see it for themselves!!!  Friendly warning...DON'T EAT HERE!!!!"}
{"text":"New location is HORRIBLE!  It's totally schipzophrinic competing with the blaring music from R&R across the street.  Why, why, why change something that was so perfect?!  Patio feels too new and concrete.  Best things on the menu are gone.  Total fail!  Should've left it where it was and put the new restaurant in the new location.  FAIL"}
{"text":"My family and I have ended up sick all afternoon after eating at this restaurant today. The service was sub-par, all the tables were dirty and I ended up being escorted by my husband and server to the car cause I was so sick to my stomach by the end of the meal. There was a pool of grease at the bottom of the nachos plate. The carne asada tacos were cold, unflavorful, and the green sauce on them was grainy in a most unpleasant way. My daughter had a hot dog that looked as if it had been cooked in the microwave for a year. My sons cheese quesadilla was so soggy. Super disappointing because the weather was beautiful, the cornhole was fun and we were too sick to go to our spring training game. What's worse, with the exception of the tacos which we literally took two bites of they gave us no discount in our bill. For a hotdog, quesadilla, nachos, 2 sodas and 2 margaritas (one of which I only drank a quarter of before I got sick and one my husband drank) we spent 70 dollars!!!! with tip. Definitely more of a \"bar\". Please don't eat the food there, you will be sorry."}
{"text":"Food and service were great. In my book Mexican restaurants are largely judged first and foremost by the quality of their Margaritas.  Unfortunately, their frozen Margarita machine had been \"broken\" for a week. Sounds like it's NOT a priority. I settled for 2 margaritas on the rocks and not even a faint buzz.  I never return to a place I feel like a tourist. I definitely felt this way. Unfortunate for the waitress as it wasn't her fault working for a restaurant they deemed acceptable to offer mediocrity at best for what is a marquee offering for a Mexican restaurant. Penny wise, pound foolish."}
{"text":"Amazing fundito and guacamole!!!  Short rib tacos were excellent as well!  Server was terrific and very attentive!!"}
{"text":"In an area where other places had 90-minute waits, we get why this place had empty tables.  Horrible service and the only joint around not offering a happy hour \"during spring training\".  Not such a great marketing scheme since the place had hardly anybody in it. We started with bottomless chips and salsa. After 30 mins and no refills on the chips and salsa, nor a return visit from our server, we grabbed another server and paid our check to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I'm sad to write this because I love the drinks here. I have always gone to Saltys in the other locations and after moving to glendale, this one is not far from me so I've gone twice now and each time got worse. The first time it seemed like we were in the way of social hour for the wait staff and this time even though they were open and it was happy hour we could only get house margaritas as the machine hasn't been prepared for customers. The bartender was the only wait staff on duty and he was put out to have to even talk to us, after one drink we couldn't get out of there quick enough. They are not usually busy there so you would think they would take all the free time they have to service the customers that are there that give them a paycheck."}
{"text":"Typical bar,  not much to say I didnt have any food.  The pool table was missing balls."}
{"text":"I had the strangest experience waiting for someone going to the doctor today. Waitress was super nice. Hostess station was a bit weird but chips and salsa were excellent. The oddity came when I left and in the time I crossed the street I realized I left a small shopping bag on the table. I crossed back and inquired at horses station. No bag. I saw waitress and she said yes she saw it. I followed her far enough to see it had already been thrown away and it had been covered in food to where the bag itself was unsalvageable. Weird and rude considering g it was likely a 5 minute time span."}
{"text":"We went to Salty senorita after a cousin's graduation. The atmosphere is nice and the place is huge. The food was just ok. the menu is a limited selection of tacos and burritos. the service was mediocre at best. They need to talk to someone about supply chain. they didn't have any Tonic for my vodka tonic or any Captain Morgan for a capt and coke. It seems outrageous to me that a huge bar could be out of such staples on a Thursday night."}
{"text":"I can't rate this place low enough. I was a good customer of the old saltys. The old place was decent food, cheap drinks and good service. This new Saltys is terrible!!! I ordered a Coors light draft and it was 4.50. What the heck? My PBR was a small can and 3 bucks. I'm pretty sure this will be my last time here. Good bye Saltys and good luck staying open with all these bad reviews."}
{"text":"Worsted service ever! This place looks like it's on the verge of being bulldozed! All staff is in a constant daze, and look like they want to be ANYWHERE but at work! Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Having a pool table, air hockey and corn hole defiantly add to the fun of this bar. The only area that is lacking is the food and that the outdoor patio is so dirty. The tacos are ok but for the price they are a total ripoff. I got the carnitas taco (it was just carnitas with onion and cilantro... To dry and no real favor, also to much meat) Marcos mahi taco (good fish but needs more sauce cause it's too dry, I don't know if mine didn't have enough chipotle aioli or what) and last the chicken taco (to juicy... It was boiled in chicken broth or something cause the stuff went everywhere and I couldn't taste any mango salsa). Overall I was disappointed in only the food. I hope they get the quality right. If they do they will get way more people in the restaurant that will be willing to pay the high prices. I'm really hoping that the quality changes so I can give them a better review! Hint hint!!"}
{"text":"Out of honey whiskey.... At 11pm on a Saturday. Hmmmm No food offered after waiting to be served for 15 minutes (prior to 11). Kitchen closes at 11.  Waitresses seem more interested in leaving than serving any guest.   Have been here 3 times since the location move. Did management change as well??because each visit, some staff seem to have an attitude about serving guests. Requested 1 of the many tv's be left on the current channel (instead of being changed to the same channel as all the others) and was treated as if I asked for the world.   Parking is limited and the 'additional' parking is poorly indicated via a dark small sign in the back.   Changes are needed in their value of guests because they have THEE best beach nachos  and chicken quesadilla. !!!  :)"}
{"text":"Funny how my previous review from May 5, 2012 keeps getting deleted!  So much for consistency.  I'll be on YELP every day reposting for each deletion.    Original review from 5/5/12:   experienced our first bout with real discrimination today at the Salty Senorita near Arrowhead Mall. To prepare for Cinco de Mayo, all of the handicapped spaces were barricaded to allow for the anticipated lines to the entrance. I approached one of the staff members and advised them that my husband is disabled and required access (not to mention it being ILLEGAL and a FEDERAL OFFENSE to not offer disabled parking spaces). Other staff members joined the conversation and advised that this was a special event so they had the right to block off the spaces. \"Oh really? Where is your permit?\" I asked. One guy looked at my husband and said loud enough for me to overhear - \"he's not really handicapped anyway\"..... LOOK DUDE - walk a mile in my husband's shoes and you'll know what it feels like to have a titanium rod in your leg, metal pins holding your spine together and enduring head trauma that required TWO craniotomies, a liver laceration, 7 broken ribs and internal damage that left a scar from nipple to hip. When you've done that, you'll understand how he deserves to park just a little closer to your establishment than someone who doesn't have those issues. PRICK! Lucky for you, my husband didn't have his cane with him or I would have knocked you off your feet with it.   To all my Phoenix area friends, please boycott Salty Senorita's..."}
{"text":"this place is fun a little on the pricey side compared to what it use to be but i do like the new restaurant"}
{"text":"Went to Saltys after seeing Giants baseball practice last Wednesday. Our server was incredibly helpful! My mom and I told her we didn't like very sugary margaritas and she recommend us to try the watermelon margarita. After she learned we loved spice she brought over pieces of vodka soaked jalapeños to put inside our drinks. Wow such an amazing and fresh combination. Our tacos were amazing and went down fast. Would highly recommend! Quick service and helpful staff."}
{"text":"I could talk a blue streak about the terrible food and drinks, but other Yelpers already have and I don't like to beat a dead horse.   The service.... the service.  6pm on a Tuesday and it was wall to wall vacant. We were there for 2 hrs and saw the server maybe 2 times after our food came. We sat with cold plates and empty drinks for an hour. We kept seeing him somewhere near the kitchen, but could not flag him down for anything. There was a table behind us that sat, ordered and paid before we even saw our server again, and these ladies had an app, cocktails AND entrees. The margaritas were also 95% triple sec. I wanted to get happy at happy hour and this place did the opposite."}
{"text":"went there to celebrate a friends birthday on cinco de mayo being disabled i was shocked to see the had blocked all the disabled parking when i asked about it i was told it was do to the special event  they were surprised to find it was illegal to block those spots. without making other arrangements and went on to insult me be questioning my disability. will never go there again!! this is a repost as my first was deleted \"some how\" and again! they keep deleting my review so i added some stars to see if that gets it to stay"}
{"text":"I really didn't expect much from this place as it seems to be really a bar before restaurant. I also did get a groupon deal for $30 for $15 which eased the pain. Food was blah and boring. My wife had Fajitas which had old looking tortillas and entirely too much onion. I had enchiladas which were just boring.  They did have alot of outdoor seating and must systems which leans towards bar not restaurant. The staff was friendly and courteous though."}
{"text":"I'd gone to Salty's back in 2007, and enjoyed it. We went again last week, and while it looked close to how I remember it, something was different. I finally figured out that this was a new location. We sat at the outside bar for Margaritas. Had a great bartender who was hilarious. Even though we'd had lunch earlier at another place, he got us some chips n salsa for free. They were good. Had a couple margaritas, and while maybe being a bit overpriced, I still thought they were good. I'd go back again for margaritas and people watching."}
{"text":"This place features a new deal each day of the week.  I came on a Monday and they had a happy hour menu that was served all day.  We got a good deal on some sliders and fish tacos as well as some Mexican beer.  The price was right, service was good, and we sat outside to enjoy the beautiful weather."}
{"text":"If you love the old Salty's then DO NOT COME HERE. If you love Scottsdale corporate bullshit then go ahead this place is for you. The old Salty's was amazing, one of the few places in old town I could enjoy because it wasn't full of rich yuppy's and the prices were actually decent and not over priced. They got rid of the best part of this place which was the extensive drink menu with all the amazing flavors of frozen margaritas. Not to mention one margarita was strong enough for me.   Their food also isn't as great as it was, the nachos are now mad with Queso cheese dip instead of cheddar which makes them horrible in my opinion.  This place is just not the same as it was, I really wish they wouldn't have changed the location or how it was set up because it was really one of my favorite places to drink and go to in old town."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere here.  It's a modern cantina staffed with hot 20 year old waitresses, and they show plenty of games.   Just stopped in for a drink while walking around old town scottsdale so I can't speak for the food. The drink menu was extensive with a lot of unique margaritas.   All in all a good place to have a drink and people watch or watch a game."}
{"text":"Among best Mexican I have ever had and I'm from Dallas and have had plenty. First, the Margaritas are huge, they have a spicy queso that is marvelous with chips to die for. The beef in the Fajitas was tender and plentiful with all the fixings and some fabulous refried  beans. Ate like a horse and I'll pay for it tomorrow but it will be worth it.    The scene is jumping on a beautiful evening with beautiful people and our server was beyond delightful. Fact is mixed Yelp reviews almost talked me out of going but it is hard not to like this spot."}
{"text":"Not Very Pleased at all, a Co worker and I went for lunch we were late coming back to work because the service took so long, we arrived at 12:09 it took almost 20 min for us to even order then the food arrived with only 10 min for us to eat it and then get back to work. We had to scarf it so fast not even sure I got to really enjoy it. Plus my friends never got a refill on her drink either maybe the worst service ever..... I was so Bummed I have wanted to stop in and eat here for a long time, but the food is WAY over priced and frankly not that good and the menu selection was also really slim pickings. The reason I did give two stars was because the salsa was amazing, but unlike most Mexican joints you had to order it, it was not complimentary. I love to go out and have Mexican food mainly because I love getting endless chips and Salsa. As a good will gesture our server did give me a to go dish of salsa but no chips to go with it. I really wish it had been different I was so looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I was at Salty's Peoria this afternoon after the spring training game and I was very unhappy with the service!  First of all, it took us almost an hour before a server came to our table.  We had to get our own menus while we were waiting for service and once a server came to our table and took our drink orders (she would not take our food order at the same time), it took another 15-20 minutes for our drinks; when we ordered the drinks we asked for chips and salsa--we were told that it would be at least 10 minutes because they were making the salsa--really?  This is not your first rodeo when it comes to serving the public after spring training games--as a matter of fact, you encourage people to come to your establishment after games--you should have had plenty of salsa ready to go.  (It took over 30 minutes before we got the chips & salsa.)  When we finally got our drinks, she took our food orders--that took another 20 minutes.  Then when the food arrived, it was wrong.  I decided to order the 2 taco special, but the server never came back to give her the order, so I only ate chips & salsa.  When we finally found our server, I ordered a beer--she forgot to bring it to me until I flagged her down and asked for the beer AGAIN.  I have been to this place many times, and sometimes the service is slow, but it has NEVER been this bad before.  Needless to say, she did not get a good tip at all.  But it was not all her fault--we flagged down a man several times asking for someone to serve us and he kept assuring us someone would be over--and we waited and waited--no one.  We should not have to hunt servers down.  Not impressed and not sure if we will return...very disappointed!  P.S.  The bathrooms were dirty and they had someone asking for \"tips\" for handing us paper towels, really?"}
{"text":"We have been there twice; decent food, good queso, no complaints about service (but not amazing). However, my boyfriend and I are both college students and we had a late night 10/21, so we called ahead to make sure they would be open when we came in for dinner. Key phrase: WE CALLED AHEAD!!! The woman on the other line said the kitchen was open until 11:00PM on Thursdays. So we drove from Tempe to Old Town; arriving at Salty Señorita at 10:45PM.  We waited at the host desk for 2 minutes waiting for someone to come by and greet us... Reminder: it's 10:45PM, 15 minutes before they close. NO ONE was around. The bartender, the servers, NO ONE. Okay, y'all are trying to close. I get it. We just want to eat really quick and get out of there. So we walk around and found three servers around the computer station putting in tips. We ask if we can put in some food. The waitress' answer, \"Oh, we did last call 10 minutes ago.\"   My boyfriend and I have both worked in the restaurant industry. We both are very aware of how restaurants work. I smiled and told her we called ahead. She continued to persist that they did last call 10 minutes ago.  So, my boyfriend and I left the restaurant. We both looked at each other half astonished and half excited to make a bad Yelp review. We agreed that if the general manager was there, and if we had asked him/her if we were able to put in food, the general manager would have been absolutely accommodating (well, hopefully, if the GM is worth anything!). We are not the disrespectful guests that will sit there and eat for another hour after you close. We were simply students that would have left you a nice tip after you served us food 15 minutes before you closed. We get it, it was late- but the rudeness of the servers was astonishing and we will NOT be returning. And we will certainly be making our friends aware of the blatant disregard for their guests."}
{"text":"This was a great find while visiting Old Town Scottsdale. Great fish tacos and refried beans. The El Pepino margarita was refreshing as well. Service could have been a little more attentive with the check, but overall a great meal."}
{"text":"Just left Salty Señorita and it was the best experience thanks to our server Ashley (Sparkle)! She helped us with all of our needs. The food was great and the service was exceptional. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town.  We came across this wonderful establishment and were quite impressed.  We first entered and were graciously greeted.  We had the choice of our football game on the TV.  The beer was ice cold, the appetizers were on point and the tacos were out this world.  The staff were courtesy and definitely easy on the eyes.  The owner/manager was out helping and mingling with the guests.  That impressed us because we never see the owners or managers of our local bars.  Kudos to this small business."}
{"text":"Great tacos open air new location lots of fun and action. Great place to hang. The hummus is fabulous with seasoned flat bread chips.. Yummy. Come here to have fun."}
{"text":"lol... I just wanted to write in here how great their beef nachos are. They are a great break to my week. I usually stop in on Wednesdays with some friends to catch a plate of the great nachos. I have had better, but not really anywhere around here. :) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The bf wanted to swing by the Salty Senorita for drinks and a quick bite before a Giants game during Spring Training.   The place was pretty busy on the outside, but kind of empty on the inside so we sat at the bar inside.  We were immediately greeted by two ladies behind the bar and given a food menu.  All seemed to be going well, but when you sit at the bar area, you see everything that happens behind the counter and what I saw was beyond foul and dangerous.    The only male bartender who was making the drinks behind the counter, first of all, was obviously intoxicated while on the job.  He was obnoxiously loud and having a difficult time pouring and mixing the drinks because he had more alcohol and ice on the counter compared to what went into the actual glasses and pitchers.  If Jon Taffer was there, he would have yelled at his ass, that's for sure.  Then, I noticed where the bartender was scooping his ice from when he was making the drinks.  He was scooping the ice from an open ice box where they also stored alcohol bottles.   I'm not a bartender, but I'm almost sure for health and inspection reasons, you're not supposed to store bottles in the same ice box as the ice cubes that you're serving in your drinks for sanitary reasons.  To make matters worse, the bartender was using a metal shaker and chipped glasses while making his drinks.  I don't know if he was too intoxicated to notice or if he just didn't care if customers accidentally drank glass chips or cut their lips on broken glasses.  I mean, you've got to wonder where the broken glass chips are if they're no longer on the actual glass.  After he was done making the drinks, he left the chipped glasses upside down on the counter and left.  He didn't wipe down or clean his station.  He left the melted ice and alcohol that he had spilled all over the counter drip over the edge of the counter and into the ice box that had the ice that he was serving to customers.  GROSS!!  I just kept watching the liquid drip from the nasty wooden counter and collect into the ice.  We had ordered nachos which came out super fast and as I was eating and watching all of this happen right in front of my eyes, I just lost my appetite.  If this is happening out in the open, I don't want to imagine how it is behind the scenes and how sanitary the kitchen would be!  We didn't finish the nachos, but I guess that was a good thing because underneath all of the chips was nothing, but a pool of oil.  Ewwww.  I have to say that the blonde girl with the short hair who was serving us did a great job on checking up and making sure we were taken care of.  Other than that, stay far away from this place if you don't want to drink broken glass!"}
{"text":"Salty's is great for outdoor happy hour with your friends. or maybe you want to set up and have a sand volleyball game. They also have live music on weekend, outdoor TV for sports fans and then again, right across from the ball field during spring training. Food...not exceptional...but if you order a few buckets of mini beers it can taste better.  The chips and salsa are a great easy much and they have unlimited refills for a few bucks.  Service...well, it can be really really slow if its crowded, so do not expect anything to come quickly.  Salty's can be a really great hangout...and that's why we have our Friday happy hours there. Bunch of friends drinking and eating chips and kicking it up sand with the volleyball"}
{"text":"Forty-five minute wait on two out of four steak tacos that were ordered.. The other two weren't placed by our server, so that was another, exactly, 45 minute wait.  The first two that came out, which my husband let me have because I was starving, were so chewy and way over-cooked.  The next two tacos were burnt.  The rest of our party was also dissatisfied with their food.. One had beef sliders, so burnt and tough.  Another had the shrimp & mango burrito which was just a soggy mess.  And the beer was delivered fast but if you wanted water.. forget about it.. literally took 30 minutes after asking the guy maybe 8 times.  Will not be going back EVER!"}
{"text":"Just a quick shout out!  Amazing place... the BEST SERVER!!  #MIrandayourock Scottsdale ... come join the fun!"}
{"text":"The tacos were good and interesting combos, but not a lot of food, and the service was pretty lousy (slow and indifferent) even on a slow night."}
{"text":"Neanderthal roided-out meatheads wearing all-black Famous Stars and Stripes clothing and the Westside tanned bleached blonds who love them can rejoice now that there's a Salty Senorita in Arrowhead.  Imagine to not have to drive your raised red Dodge half ton truck clear across town to Scottsdale to get to your nearest chain Mexican faux-beach bar!    I met my Westside ladies here last week to watch the NBA final Lakers game and marveled at how different it looks and a decent time was had.    A quick look around and you'll see some of the changes they made to the old Monastery. The kitchen is now where the bar was, the bar is now in an indoor/outdoor addition to the east and the former self serve BBQ (which was a hallmark of the old Monastery) is gone.  One of the sand volleyball courts was paved over with a huge elevated wooden patio deck, but one volleyball court remains.  The cheap happy hour margaritas were decent.  We sat at the bar to watch the game and the service was OK...pretty aloof and vacant and first, but got better as the evening went on.  The mini burgers and fries were forgettable but edible - the nachos however, were soggy and drenched in Monterey jack cheese and onions. Not enough beans or pork...guacamole or tomatoes would have been nice.  Stay away from those.  If you can order something better than I did, get past the crowd and your fondness for the former Monastery that was here for a few years, then you might have a good time here."}
{"text":"Food great!! Margaritas were made to specifications! On top of it our waitress Lauren was more than accommodating. Couldn't have asked for a better sunset spot!!"}
{"text":"Super fun bar, hidden in Peoria behind the ball field... We went for lunch and the place was dead, but the service was still kind of slow... really good food and large drink selection, though.  Stop in just for the fun beach atmosphere."}
{"text":"I met up with the grade school buddies on Friday night for some margaritas, food, and catch-up.  The weather was lovely and we sat outside to take advantage of it   The place is huge, with a lot of seating areas.  Happy Hour was in full swing so we ordered margaritas and had some chips and salsa. The chips were unsalted and the salsa literally burned my mouth.  These are the basics and I was not impressed.   There were also food options and I tried a bean-and-cheese burrito.  My friends had tacos, salad, and chimichangas.  I didn't get much feedback from them about the food other than the small size of the tacos.  My burrito was not very notable but I will admit that I'm spoiled rotten by another taco joint in my neighborhood   With 2 drinks apiece and 1 entree, we each spent about $20 before tip.  Our waiter was a really nice kid who had been on the job for a very short time but provided good service.  The plating was not fancy, very reminiscent of a picnic.  Overall, the value is minor, considering the price   This place would be a great place to hang out after a ballgame but the food was not very good."}
{"text":"Food tasty with service lacking. On a not too late Saturday night, we wanted Mexican food along Old Town Scottsdale.   Decided to try Salty's.  Wait was not long at all.  We waited 10 minutes before the hostess came and asked if we had been attended to yet.  Of course not so she brought us water and said she would return with chips.  Another 10 minutes later she brought those.  Close to 10 minutes more and the \"replacement \" waitress takes our order.  And how long before drinks arrive?  Yes, 10 minutes but only the alcoholic drinks.  My sprite took another 10 minutes even though we were next to the bar.  Finally the food comes and it is good.  I ordered the grilled shrimp bowl and hubby got the steak salad.  Shrimp could have been bigger.  Rice was cooked perfectly and the combination with the black beans was good.  If you have lots of time to kill, check this place out.  No free wifi.  We sat outside so we picked it up from RnR across the street."}
{"text":"I really like this place for a few reasons. It has a relaxed and fun environment. The food is good, the staff is friendly (young, but friendly enough) and the prices are very reasonable (especially during happy hour). If you're looking for a 5 star restaurant with white tables, this is not the place, but it measures up in likeability because of the aforementioned reasons. I am a chips and salsa fanatic and I really liked Salty Senoritas! There are multiple Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale, and they all vary in taste, decor, etc, but it's about finding the one you like the best. The new manager is also very friendly and often spends time with you to ensure you are enjoying yourself."}
{"text":"Come check out Ben, he makes awesome drinks. Decided to check this place out for happy hour, Ben makes great margaritas which is there specialty. Great happy hour food menu as well, lots to choose from"}
{"text":"I wasn't super impressed with anything here.   Food: Food was good but pretty basic. I got the big cheesy melt and two tacos.  Service: First when we walked up there was no host. I think the person that sat us was technically off-shift at the time. Kind of odd. Our server checked in about the right amount. Table over from us got upset that they weren't getting their check fast enough. Someone at the host desk (some guy) later came over and started brow-beating the bar staff from the host table. Meaning - yelling over to them from about 20 feet away about how they weren't working. Super unprofessional and awkward and I honestly was waiting for Jon Taffer of Bar Rescue to pop out of a corner and start yelling at people about how unprofessional they were being and how uncomfortable they were making their guests.  Drinks: Fiance ordered the frozen margarita flight and I ordered the La Casuela signature margarita that was said to be served in a special bowl and made table-side. Her flight was good. She said it was too strong but I liked them a lot. She still drank them all. LOL. My margarita was sub-par. My fiance also pointed out that it said on the menu that they made it at your table - they did not do that. Flavor of this margarita was very muted and certainly nothing special. For being the most expensive margarita on their menu... it was a huge disappointment.  Verdict: There are far better taco joints within a 2 mile radius that you can go to and enjoy better service, food, and drinks."}
{"text":"Gluten-free friendly..first impression dirty..service was a 10...the nachos came out cold the little cheese that was on the chips wasn't even melted no love or pride... than you had to ask for salsas it was like eating cold chips no sauce!! I was in town for a staging class  it was recommended and it was not good. It happened to be taco Tuesday and those came out stone cold and maybe the place was a 1/4 full so I couldn't eat my tacos  I didn't send them back they were only $2.00 each roasted chicken and one grill fish."}
{"text":"This place is KICK A**! First of all they have great service. I love all the bartenders at this place. I normally do not go to the servers but Ive gotten to know a few and they are all pretty enjoyable. Drinks are at a great price, for example $1.99 Pacifico's EVERYDAY from 8-close. They also have great CHICKEN TACO'S, and a amazing green chilly cheese crisp. The nightlife is awesome, always some good looking women in here on the weekends. They just recently added flat screen tv's for us sport fans or whatever they have playing on the tube. That mixed with the newly (fixed) mist system is great for those hot weekday/weekend days in the summer heat. I would give this place a 5 star but I haven't experienced enough food on the menu to give it that 5th star."}
{"text":"Save you money.  Worst excuse for Mexican food I have ever eaten.  Try Pedro's Mexican Food at 5 1st and Glendale."}
{"text":"Salty Señorita, located in old town Scottsdale, is a nice place, especially when the weather is just right and you can a meal and/or drinks on the spacious patio. The service is great though sometimes it seems that an extra server would be prudent, and though the patio is nice and heat is provided, there are a few, small metal \"things\" that stick up here and there that servers and customers could trip over. The food is delicious and the drinks generous, especially during happy hour. I would recommend it as a casual place to grab a bite or quench your thirst. Parking can be challenging as the parking lot for Salty's is down the block, while the next door neighbor, Buca di Beppo lays claim to some primo parking real estate."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot. Real chill and relaxed.The bar tender guys are very nice and super cool. Ben is one of the bar tenders super cool and down to earth. Great fresh chips. For drinks, they have cucumber watermelon margarita that is really good.  All the drinks are bomb that we tried. We will be back! Awesome chicken tacos. Can't wait to try their tamales next time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, outdoor seating in Old Town was awesome. The food was not bad, but it wasn't impressive. The nachos were drowned, only the top layer was edible and not fall-apart soggy. The crab guac was uninspired, simply guac with a bit of crab dumped on top with sriracha accent.  The chipotle chicken burrito was more promising, very cheesy and the chicken was tender. Overall a good experience, maybe better with different menu items."}
{"text":"After being provided poor service, by Matt for a group of 6 not being seen in a semi timely manner, and the server never paid attention to us when our drinks where empty we had to hail a different server for requests. the person paying provided a 10% tip.  It was prior to the end of the Giants game so it was not particularly busy.   Most of the group left after closing out 2 of us decided to stay and wait to meet a few other people after the Giants game for one more beer.  With our new group We where confronted by our server, Matt who asked us why we tipped so poorly and put the bill paid by some one else in our group neither of us, at the table. This showed a general disrespect for us our group as well as a lack of professionalism, We quickly finished our beers and left."}
{"text":"It started out good waitress took correct orders and drinks. We accidental dropped some water on the table and we saw a waitress and tried calling out but she left quickly. After that a guy came by to bring us our food so we asked him for some napkins to clean up and he gave an attitude but us the napkins and we cleaned up ourselves. we had also asked for some silverware and he never came back until our waitress finalky showed up  she brought us 5 we were a group of 7. The food and drinks were good and the staff was ok."}
{"text":"I've gone to Salty's twice: for Cinco de Mayo and on a random Taco Tuesday. Although it was fun on Cinco de Mayo it was WAY crowded that the line to the girl's bathroom was RIDICULOUS. Long story short, go on a random Taco Tuesday instead. Chicken and steak tacos are only $1 and Pacifico for $2. I really wish they would stock up on Taiwan Beer for a larger variety, but that may be asking for too much. The outside area is really nice, but super hot on a summer day. What will keep me from coming back: unlimited chips & salsa!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I've driven by it several times and it always looks like fun - the patio fronting Scottsdale Road is often packed.  After a wedding last night (May 11) we decided to stop in for some chips and margaritas. We got there about 9:00 pm - there was a decent crowd but plenty of empty tables both inside and out. Unfortunately what wasn't there was a hostess. Yes, that's right. While you are supposed to have a hostess seat you (as several signs indicate) there was no hostess. This meant the servers had to pull away from their customers to get people assigned and escorted to tables.  Maybe I expect too much but when I sit down at a Mexican restaurant I expect the server to arrive take my drink order with chips and salsa in hand. Not here. You have to ask, they aren't complimentary, and in our case we had to ask four times. The chips and salsa are pretty good but this place needs to up its game on service.  The margaritas were not very good and definitely not worth full price. Maybe at happy hour there is some value."}
{"text":"Ok just ok Table side guacamole consists of the server just mixing up in a bowl, did not meet my expectation of other experiences of \"table side\" Server was nice and tried, lacked trained skills.  Menu was not over priced, but again nothing special. Too many great restaurants around to try I would skip this one"}
{"text":"Overall a great place for fun with friends.  Food: I had the taco chopped salad and it was delicious! There was not a long wait for it either. Very pleased.  Service: Alex was my waitress. She is a fantastic waitress, friendly, and knows what she is doing!  Venue: I loved the set up! The patio is amazing! Sit outside and enjoy the great weather with some fine tequila.   The reason for not having 5 stars: A slight mix up with my tequila order, BUT I spoke up and expressed my concerns. It not only was it addressed quickly and taken care of by the house, but the manager, Matt, came out and personally served us the best tequila they had to make up for the mix up.   Very happy with this place! And I recommend giving it a go!"}
{"text":"Well the only thing cool about this place is the atmosphere , and the band that was playing that night. typical theme joint with typical theme food, nothing that catches me mind as good out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food and margaritas in the valley! Management truly keeps the staff motivated due to the exceptional guest hospitality! Also, best Happy Hour prices in Old Town Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of buddies for spring training to watch the giants and had Marisa as our waitress. Great vibe. Great food. All around great time. But I gotta give it to Marisa - she brought he positive energy all night. Gave us awesome recommendations on some tasty food and drinks. Solid service all around and we left salty feeling tipsy and full. Solid place to hang outside, watch a game and kick back with friends. Big fan of Marisa tho. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolute worst \"Mexican\" food in the entire valley.  Even worse than Ponchos Buffet, Taco Bell, Abuelos, and On the Border.  After the first bite of the salsa we should have gotten up and left but it was dinner time on a Friday night and we didn't feel like waiting at another spot.  We ended up having to send the food back.  The manager gave us free meal coupons.  Threw them in the trash.  Disgusting.  Read a newspaper article that they were possibly going to have to get a bar license because they weren't selling enough of this garbage.  Glad other people still have taste buds.  Eating here should be a punishment.  If you like to drink outdoors its an okay place to stop by and have a drink.  Just be prepared to see more Tapout shirts than at a UFC event.  And whatever you do.  Do not order food of any kind.  Not chips.  Not salsa.  Not anything.  You've been forwarned."}
{"text":"This is was the absolute worst service I have ever experienced. The saddest part is I heard Applebee's is better. We all came from out of town and visited Scottsdale for Spring Training and picked this spot for our \"fun\" pre-game place.   What a disappointment. We had to ask for a server, once we finally got one we never saw her again. Justin was the only person that actually helped us in any way which was nice.   The food wasn't bad, but the service made the entire experience one we will not forget... In a bad way...   Save your time and go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Worst.  Food.  Ever.  I don't think I've ever been so completely dissatisfied after a meal.  The food was absolutely HORRIBLE.  We came with a party of 6 on the last night of our vacation looking for good atmosphere and good Mexican food.  All the meat from chicken to carne asada was hard and dry, the tamale was water and masa which was hardened and none of it had any flavor.  We left still hungry (we couldn't eat the food) out $140 bucks and angry.  One star is generous and I give it that for being in a cool location and our waitress was nice.  I feel bad for the wait staff who are probably stiffed tips due to the food.  DON'T EAT HERE.  EVER."}
{"text":"The setting is spectacular and really good for the kids to play.  Unfortunately it does NOT make up for the shortcomings in everything else. Food is terrible.  Service is awful.  Be prepared to wait HOURS for your food. Two waitresses serve 100+ people on the patio during busy times. It's a disaster."}
{"text":"Been here many times & now get a dirty, cheap corner bar feel. Dirty bathrooms tell me a lot & now they have someone providing \"valet\" service."}
{"text":"Meh.  How do you mess up fajitas?  Steak is flavorless and tough and the shrimp was over seasoned and not fresh.  Margs are too sweet and I had to hunt down the waitress to get the bill.  So many great places to go with better service."}
{"text":"No, just say no to this place. Food-terrible. Drinks-worse. If I were 19, I'd probably think it was cool and fine. But this place needs a restaurant rescue! They obviously use frozen chicken cubes for their 'chicken' dishes. Gross. They have no well made drinks. All their drinks are some off the wall concoction of crap. This place belongs in Tempe near ASU. (no insults intended, we were all 19 once!)  Also, it's another Mexican place with a tiki. ?? Tikis are not Mexican! Hello??? However, seeing a giant tiki was my favorite part of our experience. He was as out of place as we were. Unfortunately for him, he's stuck there while we were able to walk away!"}
{"text":"Best tacos in the state! Always a great time either happy hour or Sunday's day drinking on the patio. Friendly fun staff & super attentive. I'd be there everyday if I could. I'm there every Tuesday for the free beach cruiser giveaway. Oh! The DJs are great always playing the perfect mix for drinking on the patio!"}
{"text":"Came in and was seated right away. No server shows up for around a long time  I went back to the hostess and she went in the back to get server after a few minutes we got up to leave and a girl showed up. I said we were just leaving and she said oh OK I said look if you can service a drink we could stay she had a unfriendly look at her face the whole time took of drinks menu and never came back. So we decided not to have dinner and decided never to come back"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!!!  The waitress ran my transaction through on someone else's debit card and ran the other person's transaction on my card (and the other person's transaction was about $40 more than mine).  She also gave me the other person's card (which I didn't notice until the next day when I tried to use it).  I immediately tried contacting the restaurant to rectify their mistake, but they don't answer the phone, there is only an answering machine.  I left a message, but no one bothered to call me back.  Horrible, horrible, horrible customer service.  I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Very meeeehhh.  I'm going to forgive the service piece since the place was packed and they just recently opened.  Food:  Margarita was bad Short rib tacos great, would order again Shrimp taco nearly inedible Fish taco okay Chips were heavily coated in salt...lives up to the name!  2 stars since my waitress was cute and friendly"}
{"text":"I went for Taco Tuesday. I got a buck of 5 mini coronas and 4 tacos for $9. Only $9. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this place.  We stopped in for dinner around 8 pm and wanted to sit inside and just chill after left the ESPN Fan Fest.  The service was sooo slow that we had to sit and stare waiting for assistance.  We had the tableside guac, carne asde & mauhi grilled tacos.  The chips were so greasy that we didn't enjoy the guac.  The carne asde didn't have any taste.    Not a fan.  Too many other options in Scottsdale so I won't be back."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  The vibe seemed really cool.  Actually, the vibe is cool.  And it's nice looking.  But so many wrongs completely cancelled out any good vibes.   First, I ordered a margarita blended.  The blender behind the bar was broken. That's cool; I understand that happens.  So I asked for the same margarita on the rocks instead.  The cocktail waitress said, \"I don't know if that's possible, I'll have to check.\"  I replied, \"They can't make any margarita either blended or on the rocks?\" And she again said she'd have to check.  Hrm.  I was confused, but whatever I'm an easy going person.  Maybe she was new?   Fast forward about 15 minutes.  Yes, about 15 minutes before we saw anyone again.  Keep in mind we hadn't even actually ordered any drinks yet.  Our waitress confirmed she could do the margarita on the rocks.  OK, cool.  I knew that would be the answer; glad she was on board now too!  We ordered it plus a beer.  Also ordered some tacos.   20 minutes later: the tacos come.  Still no drinks.  We asked the person who dropped off our tacos about the drinks.  He said he would check.  Cool; we're still patient at this point.  We can eat in the meantime.  The tacos were very, very disappointing.  Little flavor; very boring. The corn tortillas were soggy as though they'd been sitting for a while.  Two of the four tacos had gone cold.  We had planned on mentioning the cold tacos except no one ever came by before we decided we were so hungry we better just eat or pass out in the Arizona heat.    After eating half of the sad tacos, I finally had to chase someone else down regarding our drinks.  They reply they'll look for our waitress.  10 minutes later (at this point we are really timing this) our drinks come.  Great, except we've completely finished our food.  It was very irritating to go to a bar and get drinks served AFTER our sad food was eaten.  It was hot, though...freaking hot...and I can't wait for a nice, cold margarita!  So I dive into it...and it's got to be one of the worst margaritas I've ever had.  At least the beer was good!  Although the credit for the beer doesn't go to the bar, does it?    We even had to chase someone down to get the check.  We paid and left behind my half-consumed margarita.    Oh yeah, and a group of people next to us on the patio had a puppy with them.  It peed all over the patio floor.  A staff member saw the puddle of pee and laughed but did nothing.  Just stepped over it.  Gross.    We will not be returning here and will quickly warn others from wasting their money here themselves.  Again, we wanted to like you, Salty Senorita!  But you were terrible to us.  :-("}
{"text":"Ben the bartender still great, but things took a nasty turn when I found giant bone [see photo) in very small $2 HH chicken taco. The bone could have done some serious damage. Ben did what he could to salvage the day with some free beers, but none of the managers ever came over to personally apologize. Both those managers do not appear friendly, so not surprised. Will still drink here, but clearly dodged a bullet and a bone on this visit."}
{"text":"Prior to today, which was my first visit, I had absolutely no expectations. I was aware that Salty Señorita locations exist (well, the existence of THIS location was a surprise...), but had never been to one and don't recall any reviews from friends, either positive or negative. My Bestie and I were headed to a certain Italian joint in the vicinity for lunch when she sez, \"Hey, let's stop here...\"  Good call, B! (For the record, she'd been here before, a long time ago...like, \"it maybe wasn't even a Salty Señorita back then\" long time). It was not at all crowded on a late Sunday afternoon in December, so we were able to take a self-guided tour through the premises before deciding where to land. We parked it outside within view of a televised Seahawks/49ers game, by coicidence rather than design. I was tempted to suggest to a boisterous young lady in a Seahawks jersey to \"use her indoor voice,\" until I realized that we were, in fact, outdoors. Party on, Ma'am.  We tried nachos, fish tacos (both Estella's and Marco's), shrimp tacos, rice and beans. Jiminy Christmas, was that some tasty comida! I've had the good fortune to partake in this type of fare throughout Central America, and this compares very favorably. Upon requesting a side of jalapeños, we were brought a cup of fresh, already-diced goods - another unexpected surprise. Well played, SS, well played.  Thanks to Briana for very personable and prompt service. This is so my-kind-of-place that I cannot wait until the next visit."}
{"text":"Markell was absolutely amazing, great service and amazing food! I will come back every time I visit scottsdale!"}
{"text":"With all the restaurants available in the Scottsdale area, I'm not sure how we decided on this one. I guess somebody wanted tacos and we all agreed.   My friend went wedding dress shopping today and we decided we were hungry and ready for a bite. Today has proven to me that it is no longer patio season in Phoenix. Boy is it hot outside. They originally wanted to seat us at a table in the sun but we decided to squeeze at a smaller table in the shade.   The server gets 1 star. It's not like we had a huge group - there were 5 of us. I ordered a mimosa and the others had margaritas and beer. My mimosa didn't show up until the rest of the group was ready for a second round of drinks. I also had to point it out to our server when she finally came around to check on us.   When I finally got my mimosa, there was a black speck in it and the orange slice that was there for decor had some on it too. Maybe they had something burnt next to the orange slices...? I didn't make a stink about it and drank it but definitely didn't order another one because who knows what else I will find in the next one. And that's if the server doesn't forget I ordered one.   Food - I would give them 2 and a half stars. I ordered 2 fish tacos and one braised short rib taco. The cook was a little heavy handed with the seasoning for the fish tacos. The short rib taco was just blah but I ate it anyway because I was hungry and it's really only 3 bites since they are small tacos.   When our food arrived to the table, I asked for some napkins since we didn't have any at our table. The person who dropped off our food never came back with any so I got up and rounded up some silverware and napkins from 2 other tables.   Usually, I would round up on my rating if I was in between two ratings but because of the service we received, our experience deserves two stars. If you are craving tacos, go elsewhere. They have $20 bottomless mimosas here but you won't get your money's worth unless you plan on spending all day here."}
{"text":"Salty Senorita has awesome atmosphere, easy location w/ tons of parking and is probably best for a happy hour and drinking spot. Their menu leaves a lot to be desired, and their restaurant appears to be infested with flies... I didn't have the best experience, but did have an OK time since the atmosphere is cool. I would go back with a big group, but I won't be back for dinner or lunch, specifically.   TIPS Great cheap happy hour $1 shots Queso dip is good Lots of parking"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU LOVED THE PAST SALTY'S!  This is horrible news, Because it is not too hard to be nice to guests in your restaurant. Party of 6, and we are ready to enjoy our Sunday with great friends, enjoy some drinks and food.  We waited 30 mins for our first round of drinks. We waited an hour and a half for our food. I requested a glass with my beer and did not receive it. Our food came out wrong. Multiple food runners came coming to our table asking if we ordered this or that. The balding tall ( he thinks hes really buff) blonde manager came by- he had quite the attitude !  We mentioned how horrible the service was and how we didn't really care for the taco presentation( 1 guest has a handicap & passing tacos out of the taco holder was not easy ) - his reply was \"Don't you know how to pass a taco\" This guy sucks and needs to go back to planet fitness and work on his muscles, because he does not help any servers doing anything. Service staff needs bar rescue!   Beer tub/champagne and orange girls had no line- so we decided to grab a drink from them, they need to be taught how to serve drinks- it was like a 8 year handing me a glass of lemonade from a lemonade stand.     Looks like the owners got kinda lazy setting up the place too- back patio had a bunch of trash-  you guys will not survive after spring training!!! STEP UP YOUR GAME !"}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing! Lauren did such an amazing job! She was super attentive and friendly! She always brought everything we asked for right away. She took amazing care of us definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. The drinks on the other hand were not so great. The margarita was very sweet it was hard to drink we were disappointed. Dollar taco's were very yummy!"}
{"text":"I went this Sunday and Maria was the best server ever.  She took care of us the whole Time. She made sure our drinks were always full. She was seriously the best server I have ever had there.  Wish you could clone her!"}
{"text":"Salty's happy hour is great, along with their margarita selection...out of all my visits here, I think I've only ordered food twice, and both times it wasn't bad. Service has always been friendly too"}
{"text":"Disappointed. The service was really good, and I like the layout of the new restaurant. But the food and flies were terrible!   How can you mess up tortilla soup? I don't get it? It tasted like re fried beans and dog food. My husband ordered the guac with bacon and a shot rib taco. He didn't eat either. They put pickled beats on everything, tastes just like kimchi. I really wanted to like the new location, but they need a new cook/chef.   Don't waste your money (or calories), go to Frank and Lupes right down the street!"}
{"text":"First time visit.    Service was terrible. We had a trainee that was entirely too inexperienced to be left alone with customers. We waited 15 minutes from the time we got our drinks to order food.  He would set the food on the table with NO comment. No utterance. Who does the hiring here? You might want to hire people with personalities.  The food was just okay.  Is there any management presence in this place?  Are they tasting the food? Are they requiring any kind of standards in service, food temp, and overall experience at all? I did not see any sign that anyone was showing leadership in this place.  It seemed so promising. They are sorely in need of a detail-oriented leader.   I would not return her for anything other than drinks."}
{"text":"A SERIOUS downgrade.    Customer service is horrible. Prices are ridiculously high Food is overpriced and bland  The old Salty's was my preferred happy hour locale and was affordable as well.  A new location and bigger patio does not mean better.  Even worse is the new menu.  They need to fire the chef.  The nachos I ordered were soggy and those chips that were not soggy tasted like they had been sitting out for a few days... in other words stale.  I sat at the bar and even though I had a stool, it took me over 10 minutes to get service from the bartender.  The place was not very busy and when not serving drinks he was flirting with some girls a few stools away.  I asked the bartender what he had for bourbon and he shows me a bottle of whiskey.  I seriously face palmed and just shook my head.  I settled for a whiskey and coke.  He literally did not put more than 3/4 of a shot in the drink.  As I paid attention to how he made others drinks, I noticed that he was short pouring everyone.  Still not satisfied with the nachos, I asked for two a la carte tacos.  When they finally came out, they were absolutely bare, bland and tiny.  I miss the old Salty's where you could get some good food, a few drinks, free chips and salsa, and cold draft beers while spending less than $20 including a tip.  I do NOT suggest this place.  If you want to hit up a Salty's I suggest the one in Peoria."}
{"text":"The \"express lunch\" was not so much express as it was sloooooooooow lunch!!"}
{"text":"Bar tender was horrible. Chips and salsa were so not authentic.  I won't ever go back"}
{"text":"Worst Tanqueray and tonic ever! All tonic. Bartender said she put \"some in,\"  and could give me another shot to add to it. I'm now into this for 14 bucks. This place needs some waitstaff/bartender training. It's one and out!"}
{"text":"This place has lost the service it used to have.  I hope they can make a comeback because it used to be a good spot.  Today was the third time in a row service has been less than great.  I don't understand how in the service industry there is an lack of service but it makes you appreciate the few good spots with excellent service.  Go to this place at your own risk."}
{"text":"Thinking about the taco I took a bite off early still makes my stomach turn. If dog food (both in taste and texture) is your thing you'll not be disappointed. Plus the avocado mush they say is (sliced) looked like it could have been a week old.  Not to mention the \"fancy water bottle\" they gave us when we sat down to share had ALGAE in the bottom. Yes ladies and gentlemen. Algae like a fish tank. When I told the waitress she says \"wow that's gross\" and took it off the table. No new water. No anything. If I don't have food poisoning by the morning it will be a miracle."}
{"text":"Melodie was so nice!  She always knew what we wanted and could read our minds when we needed some shots!"}
{"text":"Service was slow, even though the place wasn't that crowded for a  late Friday evening. We ordered drinks, chips and salsa, and Fundido.  We received the drinks. Waited longer that average. The Fundido appears, but not the chips and salsa or silverware. ...And we wait. We were finally able to flag down a waitress (not ours) and request napkins and silverware. Scurring, our waitress walked pass and we were able to inquired about the chips and salsa and placed our dinner order. The waitress (in no rush) eventually brought the salsa to the table, but no chips...WTH (duh!)  Drinks were great! Food was delicious! Service suck!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.   When the waitress bright our food she never brought us utensils to eat with.  I had to get up and go to another table to get them because she was too busy talking to friends.  She had an attitude the entire time.  It was an incredibly slow night. 10 people in the entire restaurant and she acted like it was inconvenience to refill our water when it's 106 degrees outside."}
{"text":"I didn't know my cinco 2014 was going to start out with a bad taste and ill feelings toward others but a bartender at Salty Senorita accomplished that. I went to Salty like years before to start my cinco night out with a goal of sipping a refreshing margarita, unlike years before, the patio didn't seem that crowded (maybe it's a larger location?). My friend and I went to the main bar, and proceeded to wait patiently for the bartender to take our drink order. It was busy with more than 4 bartenders serving customers along with the manager, my friend and I were able to secure two bar stools, and we waited. There was a group of people to the left of me who got a drink order in even though they had been waiting shorter than us but I ignored it thinking she (the bartender) was just busy and hadn't noticed us, mind you we were sitting in front of where she was working. I remember a group of guys who were standing behind us asked if we were closing out because we had our cards ready but we said no and said we were waiting. 20 minutes had passed and still no margarita, so, we waited more, yes, I could see she was busy but I also noticed she was talking with the guys sitting to the right of us, and she was talking with a colleague at the cashier but for some odd reason when it came to us two sitting IN FRONT of her line of vision, she chose to ignore us, yet again stayed patient because that's how I am, I only get angry when I am being blatantly ignored BUT when the guys standing behind us moved to standing to the left of me, and SHE asked for their order, that was it, I had enough! So, I did what any annoyed customer did, I yelled a HEY! to her to get her attention (prior to that I took her picture), she then turned around (surprise surprise, apparently you need to show displeasure to get service here), and snapped back with, I don't serve people who swear at me! EXCUSE ME?!? when did saying \"HEY\" come off as swearing? And that was the last straw, I couldn't foresee myself staying there for a drink.   I asked for the manager as any customer would and I shared my displeasure with the lack of service I received. Yes, he offered a drink BUT that's not good enough, I refused because I just couldn't see myself spending money. So, imagine this Salty Senorita, afterwards my friend and I went to El Hefe and got ourselves a margarita, then afterwards we were looking to have dinner and proceeded across the street to Hi-Fi, and ordered food and more drinks, when our intention that evening was to go to Salty Senorita, grab a drink or two and have dinner. We spent close to $80 that could have been spent at your establishment but because of the discourteous service of a bartender who lacked the attention of scanning the bar as well as to check who needed orders and such, you lost a few customers. Now, that's sad."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews on Yelp but this place is pretty awful. Food is terrible. Avocados in my salad and guacamole were pretty much brown and black. Waitress had zero personality. We were never given silverware or plates. Grossed out at this experience."}
{"text":"In the mood for some pre-game tacos and drinks, a friend and I stopped here on St. Patrick's day. We found the lively atmosphere fun (and not quite as overwhelming as some of the other spots nearby.)  We shared the guacamole and had a mix of tacos, which were all delicious. The chips are those thin Tex-Mex style ones, yum! I also liked that they offer the option of having lettuce shells for your tacos if you're in the mood for something a little lighter.   I ordered a skinny margarita and found it to hit the spot! My friend tried one of the house margaritas and found the mix a tad sweet for her - worth knowing!  We noticed the service, seemingly from the kitchen, was a bit inconsistent - orders seemed to come out at random. However our server was very attentive and sweet. It might have also been a bit busier than normal with the holiday.   Overall, we enjoyed our experience and will visit again next spring training!"}
{"text":"My favorite bar. Great drinks and good service. Payton is by far the best server there. She handled 12 of us drunk crazy people and she was on top of everything. Love saltys."}
{"text":"Only receiving a 2 star because food was good. Wait staff was horrible to put it nicely. Manager had a major attitude problem and so did his waitress. When we asked the manager to change the channel, he proceeded to yell and tell us he was busy and had people call in sick. You don't take your employees lack of work ethic out on your customers ever!!! This place was dirty and not well maintained. Zero pride in the company and that will eventually shut your doors for good but not if your staff doesn't do  that 1st!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE... Sat down outside at 420 on a friday afternoon, the college  boys that sat down 5-10 minutes after us were greeted before us. We went inside to get cool, after several minutes of watching the bartenders and manager chit chat the manager finally came over with menus, managed to jam it into the top of my hand, stated our server would be right over yet still took several minutes... the place was empty by the way... the sad thing is the last SS I visited was terrible... I suppose that WILL be the LAST time I go there... we are instead visiting the Second Story... very interested in the atmosphere..."}
{"text":"Horrible bartender. Rude and the audience they attract is nothing but racist white people who claim this is a good \"Mexican\" bar/restaurant. Bartender is a lame Lenny kravitz wanna be."}
{"text":"We came here for a bday party and on a consistent level, the service was terrible. I guess we had a server AND a food runner because after being completely ignored for 20 mins we finally flagged down (we later found out) the food runner. She said she wasn't our waitress but would take our order. When we asked her opinion about the food she told us, \"the food here sucks\". So we just picked a cheese crisp. After waiting 15 minutes for the beer we ordered, we flagged down the server who said, \"oh, don't order from her, she's just the food runner\" WTH? It took forever to get any kind of service and everyone walks around there like they are lost. The only time we go there is if someone is having a party which is too bad because the concept is good but the food and service always sucks. Stop hiring the girls for their looks and get someone in there with a brain."}
{"text":"You guys - I am SO sad to do this. If you know me, you know I love nothing more than giving glowing, positive reviews to all local businesses. But I guess every now and again you have an experience that just isn't worthy of the praise.   We were craving tacos and my husband wanted to watch the ASU game so we stopped into Salty Senorita for a few beers, grub, and the game. It was a Saturday afternoon and aside from the cool ambiance and a lot of TVs, it was pretty dead. It started off good - we ordered a bucket of coronas for $20 which isn't bad at all for Old Town! I also really enjoy their chips and salsa.   But then, it all went downhill. I ordered 3 tacos - one chicken tinga, one carne asada, and one shrimp. You guys - all 3 tacos lost their bottom as soon as I picked them up! Yep, all of the insides went falling onto my plate. Ummmm, what? Yes, corn tortillas can be sensitive but you're a Mexican restaurant, this shouldn't happen. SO, I proceeded to eat the insides with my fork and tried to salvage as much of the tortilla + ingredients as I could. Not only that, the tacos were SO BLAND. I make them better at home. It was so disappointing. I may have forgiven them for falling apart if they at least had good flavor, but nope! :(   Lastly, the service. Our waitress brought the wrong beers and never {literally never} picked up our dirty dishes. So after 20 minutes of letting them sit in front of us {and she literally walked by 2-3 times}, we took it upon ourselves to set them on the table next to us.   YIKES. This experience was not one to remember and I can honestly say that I won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday, while in town to visit my Girlfriend and her Daughter, bringing them and my Mother for lunch.  The customer service in this visit was great, but to mention we came early and it wasnt busy.  Here is my opinion of the drinks and meals.  The cadillac margaritas were good but on the weak side.  The chips and salsa were okay, as the salsa it came with was almost none existent on spicy.  However, the habinero sauce was great.  The tacos should have a bit more to them, but the burritos were good for the price and size.  They have this nice pond but would be cool if it was clean."}
{"text":"Excessive smoking, and a little tough to get service. I have to admit though, it was during a show. Of course, they regularly have shows and should be prepared for it."}
{"text":"This was a great find and very reasonable with the price. The tacos was great and the enchiladas where even better. The service was great we could not ask for more. Oh yea the margaritas where very good also. Definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with the food, clientele, or the service. There are two good things about this place: ice cold beer and it is next to the ball field."}
{"text":"If you are catching a Spring Training game in Peoria, this is a great place to cool off or warm up with a margarita and a few Coronas. I have been making the pilgrimage to Peoria for 10 years now and Salty's has become a routine stop for the past several years. You can get into batting practice for some player autographs around 9:00, then to Salty's until the the game starts at 1:05. They open at 10:00. It is also a hopping place for post game, especially when the home team wins. I especially like the adirondack chairs and palaypas in the sand, up against the practice field fence. And there is plenty of people watching opportunities."}
{"text":"\"You ever see an Eskimo pee?\" ......that was the question being asked by the chef to his coworkers when he should have been checking the temperature, texture, and overall edibility of his kitchen's food. This place needs some SERIOUS ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY. We ordered chips & salsa....one dish of salsa was cold, the other was room temperature. Neither were great. Our plates arrived and I immediately sent the \"shredded beef\" taco back and asked them to take it off the bill. The meat was grey and cool. As for my chicken salad, the meat was unseasoned and the chop was too big for the cucumber & tomato. There was no dressing. My son ordered pork enchiladas with the beans on a side plate.......no side plate, beans touching his enchiladas. He said he'd deal with it but watching him try to enjoy the almost inedible \"pork\" (still unsure if it was chicken instead) was a struggle in itself. My first Corona had been the only joy in the lunch, so I ordered another. Mistake. The second beer had a lime in it that tasted metallic/off/not fresh!   Will NOT be returning to Salty Señorita. QC is sadly missing from this scene."}
{"text":"I've brought friends and family to this specific location a few times over the past month (December 2014) Each time I've went there, our appetizers were either forgotten or came out after our meal. I've gave them a few chances and just got back from eating lunch there today... My Steak and Avocado Salad came out Black and Slimy..(Rotten) And the Chicken Tortilla soup had a thin slimy consistency as well... I noticed that the owner was even in and didn't do anything to help us with our issues or meal... The only thing good I can say was that the bartender Erick took care of our drinks and was more than accommodating...The food however was not to my liking or anyone else's for that matter.. I will not be back.."}
{"text":"You have to love this place for what it is. I love that we have an out door space to hang out, have a large group party, eat some cheap taco's and have some cheap beers. I will admit that the service is always a little bit lacking. But if you take a second, look around, and understand that this place is VERY LARGE, these servers are taking tables all over the restaurant. And lets be honest. This isn't the type of place where you come for the outstanding service. You come to party, or relax in the nice AZ weather.   You have two tables with giant Jenga, a nice little Bag's area, a place to play horse shoes, a fire pit, and a large space for sand Volleyball. There is so much to do. You can let the kids go crazy while the adults can enjoy some adult time. You can also go inside where there is some seating for those super hot days, but you still want some great tacos. They have a nice Sunday brunch. You can bring your pup's on a leash. Drink and shot specials all day everyday. At night this place turns in to a club vibe. It can sometimes be a bit of a young crowed but for the most part its pretty mixed and fun. During \"season\" there is a second bar that opens up outside so that the lines for drinks aren't so long. There is usually a \"DJ\" and a small dance floor by the main bar.   And of course one of my favorite things about this bar is that it is right next to Peoria Sports Complex. And you know what that means!? Spring Training FUN!! I love to go there before and after Spring Training games.  So I'm really not sure why people get their panties in a wad with this place and their bad reviews. Enjoy this place for what it is. Relax, grab a cheap bear, some tacos, and play some bags."}
{"text":"Don't let the bad reviews fool you. This was the best night out I've had in a while. Me and my girlfriend shared an app shared meals and each had a few drinks and their \"mystery shot\" (which was a delicious strawberry margarita flavored shot for only a buck) all this was under 60 bucks and Jason (our server) had excellent recommendations, and was a great time. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I took my family to this establishment to see the local alternative band  The Love Me Not's who were to hit the state at 9 pm. We arrived at 8:15. The place, small indoor seating and large outdoor seating, was packed to the point where we couldn't find a seat outside. We went inside to order some food and wait until 9. Inside, it took 10 minutes before we were approached and given a menu. Drinks came quickly (iced tea, lemonade, and water) and we placed an order for nacho's when they arrived (8:30). By 8:55 the waiter approached offering us chips and salsa as we waited. I explained that we were there to see the 9 o'clock band and that we'd be outside shortly. A second waitress approached, the one who was supposed to be our server all along, asking if we needed anything. Being 9 PM I canceled the order and offered to pay for the drinks. She gave us the drinks for free. We went outside. The place was still packed and while we couldn't hear the announcement of the next band very well, we didn't hear them say anything similar to the Love Me Not's. Disgusted with the experience we left. We ended up at Old Chicago on Bell and had nacho's.  The issues with this place are piss-poor management and a total lack of organization. I blame the kitchen for being slow (possibly understaffed).  We didn't see or hear the band we came for, we didn't get the food we ordered.  I will not be coming back here again."}
{"text":"After eating here tonight, I'm trying to wrap my brain around all these negative reviews.  The service we got was great--our server Sarah was spot on, never letting our drinks get empty, friendly, and our food was served hot and fresh.  The decor is amazing, the food is reasonably priced ($3/fish taco at happy hour is just 50 cents more than you pay for the ones at the 24 hour drive through, and very tasty), and the seating is comfortable.  The appetizers were a little high, but the crab guacamole we ordered was terrific and worth a little extra.  Perhaps people went into this place expecting one of those Mexican restaurants where you stuff up on bagged chips and salsa then get a plate covered in cheesy rice and beans, a bit of lettuce, and something that looks like a burrito drowning in red sauce.  It's not that kind of restaurant.  It's a sports bar.  It's loud.  It's fun.  And the food is sports bar food--quality, yes, but still bar food.  If these people want the same old stuff, I'm sure there's a Chi Chi's somewhere in Ohio that still has a table available....  We will definitely be going back to check out the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I have been to Salty Señorita before and it was a fun time with friends for chips and salsa and margaritas! Although, this last experience might be one of my last times going to Salty Señorita... My family was in town visiting and we decided to go to Old Town Scottsdale to get some Mexican food. I told my family Salty Señorita would be a great place to go from my previous experience. Our food tasted great! My family had a mixture of different tacos and I had the grilled shrimp burrito bowl. The grilled shrimp burrito bowl was SO delicious! Although, as we were eating we noticed the glass water jug the waiter brought out for us to refill our water glasses had MOLD at the bottom of the jug!!!!!! My family all had drank the water and they were about to get on an airplane right after lunch hoping they wouldn't get sick on their 4 hour plane ride home. We told the very nice waiter and she felt SO bad and removed some items off our bill. Once we got our bill she actually over charged us on the number of tacos ordered. Finally the bill was resolved and we left. It is worth looking at the dishes (and receipt) before bringing them to customers because this makes me question how clean the restaurant actually is..."}
{"text":"Nachos are an enormous portion and delicious. This spot features a ton of TVs for watching the big game and space to hang outside. The margaritas were pretty tasty and happy hour begins at 3 daily."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, but that is were the benefits of this place end.  The food is not great and it's overpriced, the drinks are also a bit much, and the employees are pierced, tatted-up, and look like they don't bath as regularity as you'd like for someone who handles other peoples food."}
{"text":"We tried few pitchers of margaritas and I loved the watermelon cucumber margarita! It was so amazing! Will definitely go back for it"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try after looking around for something new to try. The house margarita was average as were the nachos. The $3 street tacos were average as well...definitely not worth $3. I'm a small person but wasn't full after eating the nachos, chips and salsa (which aren't complimentary...something I found odd), and 3 tacos. The atmosphere was nice and sitting out on the patio was pretty nice as well. The staff was fantastic and the waitress was very helpful but I still found the food average and slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"What a Joke, Only Mexican Place Ive ever been to that you have to PAY for chips and salsa. Ok not a big deal but thought it was a joke. Then we saw on the menu, \"if you were just at a baseball spring training game (which we were) then you get a free shot of fireball\". So we asked for those shots and............. They don't have fireball. But they will give you Jagger? Cause we are 21 right?   Got the Quesadilla and I swear my home made one were 100 times better. worst 15 dollars of my life.  Then lets add they have bucket of beer specials but depends on the beers you get. Ok, lets get some Dos Equis.  Server: How many do you want?  Us: How many come in a bucket? Server: As many as you want. Us: So 6 will work? ok $35 bucks.  lol so thats a beer bucket deal? What? This place sucks ass. fucking Joke.  We enjoyed our server the only start on here goes to her. Pretty awesome chick. She filled us in telling us the owner doesn't care about this location at all. Doesn't put time or money into it. And when we told her that her manager was staring at us like he wanted to fight us. She tells us he is a complete jerk off and is jealous of every guy who comes in and will start yelling cause he thinks she is hitting on other guys. So Shout out to the Flood Water Skinny jeans Fu*k Boy. You look and act like a little Bi*ch. So lets just say... Stay away from this joke of an establishment or maybe go and punch Fu*ck Boy in the face."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and to me it's okay. The first time i ate here was before they renovated the place. I got tortilla soup which was okay but the thing that got me a little bit worried was the black speckles in my soda. I hope it was dirt and not rat poop! My bf's dad ordered a drink too that day and it had dead mosquitoes in it.  The second time i ate there was after the renovation. The restaurant looked better but the food was still okay. My bf and i good street tacos, they were good but seriously they were expensive. It's a street taco people! It's supposed to be cheap and not high class. This time there wasn't black suff in my soda (thank god). For mexican food it's okay but it's on the pricey side for being Mexican food."}
{"text":"We ordered 5 different tacos Love the shrimps tacos, fish tacos are alright too blend, but the service is awesome !!! Definitely will come back..."}
{"text":"A definite 3 star evening. We enjoyed happy hour on the patio for a friend's birthday recently. It wasn't terribly busy for a Friday evening but the server told us it's very hoppin' on Saturdays as they have a live band etc. The Happy Hour margaritas were tasty but the food was just kind of ok. Nothing overwhelming at all. If you are trying to entice people to come back for dinner, I would think you would jazz up the tacos and other foods, but I guess considering they are on the HH menu, they have to keep it toned down to keep it cheap. The salsa is good albeit a little more blended than I prefer. The chips though are very bland. They are served cold and not seasoned at all. At least give them a little toss of salt while they are still hot though I have a feeling that these chips aren't made on premises.   While I could be more generous with the stars based on the service we received, I can't give more than 3 stars because even though we asked if we would still receive happy hour price for our margaritas when we ordered another round at 7:15 and our server said 'of course!' we got charged regular price for them. :( Not cool...and we didn't notice until after we left. :("}
{"text":"Last time I'm going to Saltys. It used to be great, the menu had a lot of super options and the service was great. Just found out the menu changed. The servers were all standing around doing nothing but chatting. The nacho meat choices on the menu said chicken ,pork or beef even though they no longer have pork. I had to get up at least 4 times to find our waitress...1st time was after sitting for 10 minutes waiting for a menu. I should have known what I was in for and just left. I used to love you Saltys but I'm afraid we're forever over."}
{"text":"I ate here last night 12/14/17 with my fiancé, his daughter and her son who is 9 mos. old. The waitress brought the chips and salsa before she brought our drink which wasn't a biggie, just a slight irritation. My fiancé's daughter requested no beans with her steak fajitas and was still brought beans. Again, not a biggie. The food was decent. I ordered the rotisserie chicken tacos. Not the best tacos but not the worst tacos. There was a chipotle sauce on them that had a weird flavor. I also had a pineapple margarita which was delicious. Now when trouble started is when we got home several hours later. I had the WORST stomach ache. I went to lay down and just chalked it up as maybe I ate too much. About an hour after that I felt this intense we urge to throw up. I barely made it to the bathroom before throwing up. A couple hours later the remainder of the meal came up. My fiancé's feels fine who had the exact same meal minus the margarita so I didn't attribute it to the food until I talked to his daughter who also threw up ALL night. I will never return and advise others to steer clear of this place!"}
{"text":"Bartender suggested the Margaritas for us and was spot on, she called the sunny siesta for me and the Loubiton for my Salty Seniorita Girlfriend/wife I give this a 5 star call purely on drinkability nothing to do with the cuisine!!!"}
{"text":"First time back in quite awhile. Stopped with my mom for a margarita and shared the car it's flatbread. While the margarita was decent but not anything special, the carnitas flatbread was delish!! We shared it and both left very satisfied with the food. I'd come back for that in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Update V.3  After a couple more good experiences I felt like they deserve a better rating.  Came here a couple weeks ago with a large party and the waitress was very accommodating as our party grew a little bigger than expected.  No problems splitting the checks and she continued to serve us as we moved over to a reserved fire pit area.  This place is back in good graces just in time for Spring Training!"}
{"text":"Come on... it's Scottsdale can you at least have real cranberry juice????????  For my cocktail???  I would certainly pay a little extra"}
{"text":"We were walking through old town Scottsdale and stumbled upon Salty Senorita. We were seated right away and were given the choice between indoor or outdoor seating. The outdoor patio has misters so the seating was tolerable with the high heat. The waiter greeted us promptly and took our orders.   I ordered a sauteed shrimp taco and a grilled chicken taco. Both were around 3 dollars. They are street taco size. We also ordered chips and salsa which was an additional 3 dollars, but it was bottomless. The salsa was decent.   I ordered a flight of 3 frozen margaritas for 12 dollars. A little over priced as their regular margaritas during happy hour (3-7pm) are 4 bucks. These margaritas were small, honestly, all three were probably the size of one normal one. And it was three times the price. If I would have thought it through I should have gotten one or even three full ones it would have been the same price. They should really discount the flights during happy hour. But they tasted great! The frozen marg flight is prickly pear, mango and strawberry.   Overall, I would only go again during happy hour for drinks. Since the margs are such good price during happy hour (4 bucks). The food was ok, not great.   The images below are taken before food was eaten and before I took a sip of the margaritas so you can see how small they are."}
{"text":"Oh salty's....if you are new to town, don't order the food here, thank me later. This place used to be the place to b if you were in your 20's and 30's. Nowadays this place is a virtual dead zone. Their cheap beers aren't cheap anymore and unless you like slow country music, the outdoor heat and the crickets as guests, at 10 pm on a Saturday, go to literally ANY other bar in the area. 2 and a half stars Yelp? That is 1 and a half stars too generous. I rest my case and goodnight."}
{"text":"Drinks are good, food sucks & is expensive.  Atmosphere needs major upkeep."}
{"text":"This place is one of those establishments that could flourish with the right management. Unfortunately, it seems that management is 100% incompetent. I've had so many bad experiences here that I couldn't even begin to get into them. If you sit inside, good luck. You won't get served for at least 15 minutes, if they even notice you're there. Service is always horrific. The food is below par. On one occasion I came here with a group of friends and we had to show our IDs at the door. Once inside we got our drinks and headed outside. I had a big security guy following me around and finally he came up to me and asked to see my ID. I was so confused. Didn't I just show my ID at the door? How could I have gotten in if they checked ID's at the door??? He was extremely rude and spent a good solid 60 seconds staring at my ID and turning it over and over. Then handed it back to me and walked away... What? Anyways.. This place can be fun if you want to drink with friends outside. Just don't expect decent service !"}
{"text":"The food sucks. They even brought out our cheese fondido in a plastic container! Atmosphere is cool"}
{"text":"Salty is right! Ordered the sizzling steak fajitas and my vegetables and meat were caked in sodium. My tortillas were a bit over cooked, as they were almost cracker like around the edges. But, honestly, who doesn't like a lil salt once in a while...!? I gobbled those puppies right up!! I also loved the outdoor seating, and our service was pretty excellent considering we had a rowdy table of 6 girls celebrating a bachelorette! I don't know if I'd rave about this place, but it's good for your buck, and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Love, Love the atmosphere, margaritas are awesome and the food is great!!  Cheers.  Lisa"}
{"text":"The food is acceptable. It is a little noisy. We were there on a Friday evening. The service was VERY slow! The server first got our beer order wrong - Bud Light (really?) then she seemed more concerned with the table next to us and giving them a reference to her tattoo parlor."}
{"text":"That 1 star is generous. When we were seated outside, our chairs literally were falling apart. Seriously, wooden slats fell off the chairs. Parts fell off the handles and the seats if several chairs. We had to ask for more chairs to be brought over.  Our waitress made herself very scarce for the entire night. She would disappear for about 45 minutes at a time. The bussers were much more present and available than our waitress. At one point we had to ask our busser to ask our waitress to put in anorder for us. I actually felt bamboozled leaving her a tip. The chips and salsa: Chips were mediocre, but  please do not call that dark red, bitter mess salsa! I don't know what it was, but I'm not even sure it was made with a tomato. Actually,    I'm confident that there was never anything resembling a tomato in that mess. Each one of us took exactly 1 taste each. We all thought it was weird and gross.  I could actually go on about more issues, crunchy avocados in the guac, yucky fries, feeling like you're being held hostage since there was no one bringing us our checks, etc. BUT there was 1 good thing! I ordered several different types of tacos and there was a standout from the crowd of meh. The carnitas taco was good. I wished it was the only type on my plate. It's a great space. Too bad the food and staff leave much to be desired."}
{"text":"LUNCH!!! This is my favorite lunch spot. Got to get the lunch box. Its huge and every choice  is favorable  Sit at the bar and ask for Ben. He's very attentive. Nice outside seating, and the margaritas are on point Boom"}
{"text":"My sister and I went to Salty's for Cinco de Mayo. We actually had a great time! The place has a lot of open space, I love how it's like a big backyard party with all the amenities! The food was simple, but totally tasty (chicken burrito). Service was pretty good. We were lucky we got there early because there was a huge line later in the evening and they were only letting people in as people left. I would have personally never waited that long to get in. Margaritas were cheap and gave the typical heart burn from the pre-made mix, but we had a good time!"}
{"text":"My review is definitely biased. I work in the area and know a lot of employees here, who are all hilarious and competent.  I tend to drink way too much and have way too much fun. This place is so big, it is hard to get bored. Woooo go salties!"}
{"text":"I have come back here a few times now and it definitely grows on you. The patio is great if you want to hang out and have some cocktails. The tacos are a perfect size and are all really tasty. Their house salsa is AMAZING. I crave it. All of the servers have always been friendly as well. Service can be a bit slow when they are busy but that's understandable. The food always comes out quickly so if you're in a hurry it works great. The only downside is the blasting music that's always going."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times now and the food is always great.  I'd rate the place a 5, but the service is always hit or miss; sometimes they're friendly and attentive, but other times they can be slow and inattentive... besides that though, the atmosphere is nice, never too noisy, good vibes overall."}
{"text":"I only come here because of Ben and Jeremy. They have interpersonal skills unlike anyone else! Engagement is everything! Yes, I have many favorite menu items here but service to me means more than anything. Feels big welcome AND good food is a top combo!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this has only 3.7/5, so much goodness. Bacon guacamole is delicious. The Cancun flight of margaritas also superb. The blackout margarita was a questionable choice before it arrived but it turns out that the flavors in it are just perfect.  Nothing like I have ever tasted before. Had several different tacos, braised short ribs and the asparagus were my favorites by far. Service was excellent.   Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"Food = 4 stars Service  = 2 stars  This place seemed like it has a lot of potential. I'm sure it would have been great on a Friday or Saturday night. The Patio was pretty big, and looked like a great place to just hang out and watch the people or cars cruise on by...  We arrived just before happy hour started, not too much people, so not very busy. At first it seemed as though we were going to get some attention. We got a warm greeting as we got through the doors, as soon as we sat down, a server came by and asked if we wanted to see a menu and order a drink. We said yes, ordered a couple of Cadillac margaritas, and asked for a few minutes to look over the menu. Not 5 minutes went by when another server asked if we wanted to see a menu or order a drink. We politely told her someone had already took our drink order & that she'd be back to take our order.  So a couple minutes go by and a completely different gal comes back with our drinks. She doesn't ask if we were ready to order, but just drops off our drinks. Ok, I'm assuming the original girl is coming back right? Finally about ten minutes go by, and the second gal that approached us happens to pass by. We flag her down and tell her that the original gal never came back, and asked if she could take our order instead. She apologized, said they were having some shift changes and that the original gal was still our server, however, she'd be happy to put the order in for us.   Luckily, the order came out quick! It's not like we were in a hurry anyway, but the original gal came back to apologize, didn't say why she didn't come back, but at least she said sorry, right? Oh well!   On to the food... the tacos were not too bad. My friend and I weren't too hungry, so we just ordered an appetizer and a couple of tacos to hold us over till dinner. The bacon guacamole appetizer was yummy, it was served with some fresh, salted chips. Mmmm. Lots of bacon! Big chunks too! Probably more bacon than guacamole! Jk. (It's a good thing I love love love bacon!) Lol. I think I could have had more servings of it. =) The tacos were good too. Very flavorful. I had the grilled shrimp taco. Loved the avocado in it! My friend had the chicken one. The special sauce got me. Spicy, kind of a kick to it. Pretty good! The margaritas were ok. Nothing out of the ordinary.   All in all pretty cool place. There's a bunch of other places like these all over town. I'd say it was ok. Worth a try. If I do come back, I'd come later at night. Like I mentioned earlier, patio looks like a cool place to hang out and people watch."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite early afternoon ... place smelled like a dirty bar... no one greeted us... had to seat ourselves... drinks took forever and the waiter kept disappearing. Food was fair...  but the silverware was dirty and we had to ask for another set... we lost our appetite with it all.. very dissapointed! Would not return nor recommend it... when u drive down the street u can still smell sewer smell... they need to fix it!!!"}
{"text":"It would have had a 5 star review. The food is amazing. Music is great. Service was standard. But then we went to the bathroom and it was down right filty, nasty, disgusting. There was some sort or caked on mess in the toilet. I think it was poop or puke. Either way it looked like the bathroom wasn't cleaned in over a month."}
{"text":"Excited to finally find a place in the west valley for happy hour besides West Gate, we looked on the online menu to see if it was worth checking out. And we've been to the one in old town Scottsdale so we thought it was going to be similar. Man were we wrong. Though this place has so much potential to thrive based on their location and set up, somewhere down the chain of command this place fails. The menu wasn't what was online. And when I asked for an item that was on the printed menu, they said even that menu was incorrect. So there has been 3 revisions of the menu and they still don't have an updated one. Their happy hour is not impressive at all. They just a few drinks on happy hour. The margaritas are served in small clear plastic solo cups. This caused all the salt to fall inside the drink before it was served. Not a good setup there. Though their food was good, the service was severely lacking. I wish they would get their act together as its a great location, but unless I see things change and they actually put effort to make this place good, I won't be back and I don't recommend anyone else going. I don't know how this place continues to stay in business.   These place needs to be on Bar Rescue. It's that bad."}
{"text":"I went in on a Sunday for brunch with a group of 5. Everyone enjoyed their food & we all ordered bottomless mimosas. 45 minutes before bottomless mimosas, our server stopped coming over. We only had our mimosa refilled once and when she finally came back over she said they ran out of champagne. She apologized but asked if there was anything else she could get us instead. I said no but 2 of my friends asked for a Bloody Mary instead thinking it was on the house since they ran out of mimosas. She ended up added the Bloody Mary to the bill in addition to the bottomless mimosas.   We usually enjoy the bottomless mimosas at R n R but that weekend it was really packed. Next time we know it's not worth heading over to SS for bottomless mimosas because 1 refill is not really considered bottomless."}
{"text":"I tried this place with my mom while she was visiting from out of town. We had a very pleasant dining experience, thanks to Annabelle. We arrived with a localdines coupon and were impressed with how graciously she handled the coupon as well as our order, since we did make some special requests (hold tortilla strips/no rice, etc). The food was delicious (chicken fajitas, chopped salad). Annabelle also made sure we never went thirsty and brought us plenty of refills of iced tea. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Our main course came out before our margaritas. Then what type of Mexican place runs out of guacamole??  Yet they had the nerve to give us fresh avocado instead. Excuse my but does your cook not know how to make guacamole? The serves was slow but out fajitas were pretty good."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was perfect. Great vibe. Really diverse crowd and they had a DJ playing some good tunes at a respectable volume. Noticed there were a few beach cruisers near the hostess' station, and was told that each Tuesday, a guest wins a free bike as a raffle prize, and the raffle tix were free. Way cool!   Restaurant was packed upon arrival, but that didn't effect the service at all. Got a great seat on the patio, greeted right away with a friendly smile from our server, and got our drinks and bacon guac (try it, I dare you) within 15 minutes. Service was excellent, and our server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the tacos from the regular menu because they just sounded too good to pass up. Tacos: I had the braised short rib, grilled shrimp and the fish...all excellent and the corn tortilla was made in-house. Tacos were all flavorful and  presentation was creative.  Stuck to beer tonight, so no Margs, but chatted it up with a few other diners that really loved theirs.  All in all, an awesome experience and a vibrant crowd of old and young just enjoying a beautiful evening.  I'm definitely a fan. Looking forward to the patio with friends soon."}
{"text":"Weak margaritas, stale food all around. While the wait staff was very nice, the food and drinks were pretty terrible. Will not be back..."}
{"text":"Good food and we had great service! The drinks were huge! The Bloody Mary bar was a little picked over and messy, but that's the only complaint. Food came out really fast we we loved the atmosphere! We were pleasantly surprised with our experience and we would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Tired from a long flight in and stomach was in a different time zone.  We wanted to try something new so we went here.  Not too bad!  Friendly service, good prices, margarita wasn't bad, the patio was great to sit on but the happy hour stuff was nice!    Lots and I do mean lots of people were rolling into here after work for happy hour.  We ordered some nachos as an appetizer that we could've had for a meal.  Cheese, beans, meat....they were loaded!  Loved my calamari taco more than the fish one and hubs enjoyed his big burrito!  The next table had some chicken wings that looked darn good too.  Then there was dulce de leche cake for desert!  Oh yeah.............."}
{"text":"Live music, drinks, outdoor activities such as volleyball & horseshoes, plus fire pits and lots of outdoor seating. This place is cool!"}
{"text":"The experience started out so well.  I brought 2 people to  brunch on Sunday. We were seated quickly at a high top table. First problem: The cushions have a wedge shape so you feel as though you are sliding down the seat of the stool. I ordered a California burrito. We also orders chips and guac as an appetizer. My California burrito did not have bacon as the menu advertised. It had pretty much nothing but eggs. Eggs and a tortilla for $10? I also was not offered a second drink. I feel like I've been mugged by snotty Scottsdale scammers."}
{"text":"We were in Old Town Scottsdale and most places were pretty busy due to the World Series.  We gave them a try mainly because they were not too busy and had a patio.  Once we were seated by the hostess, our server finally came over after about 5 or so minutes (she mentioned the hostess giving here incorrect description on where the table was).  We ordered drinks and water, and it took about 10 minutes to get the water, which was brought by the hostess.  She apologized and said they didn't have enough servers to cover, but I was unclear if this was normal or if they were short due to someone not coming in.  Either way, they were not THAT busy IMO.  After 20 minutes, we still had no drinks.  When she finally brought them she said the bar was \"backed up\".  I could see the bar clearly from where we sat, and I've watched bartenders that were slammed; he did not look that busy to me.  We also ordered food, and although my wife's order came out wrong, and we had to flag someone down to fix it.  Once we did, they got her a new plate out extremely quickly.  The manager did come over and talk to us without us complaining or asking for him, so that was really good and proactive on his part.  One thing I did notice though, their outside seating was covered in a fine layer of grit and sand.  Not unexpected for Phoenix when the wind is going, however they seem to keep plates, silverware and napkins at the outside tables at all times.  They were not exactly clean either; if I were them I'd have at least stored them upside down, or better yet brought them out as needed.    I do have to say, their food was quite good.  I enjoyed both the specialty margarita and the wine what we ordered as well.  So to give a synopsis, the good was great but the service was sub-par.  I do not know if this was normal or not, so I would give them another chance."}
{"text":"The place is cute, we sat outside and it was hot but they have water mist so you can feel the cool air breeze. They sat us down really quick and we went straight to ordering drinks! I got Maria's choice margarita and my friend got the jalapeño margarita. Both really good!!  The guacamole was sooooo fresh! It tasted like someone's Mexican abuelita made it! I ordered the corn with shrimp tacos. And she ordered the Ceviche, very brave of her. But it was amazing! The food was so fresh and really good. So why the 4 stars, the chairs were not high enough for the bar table, the menus were sticky and the silverware looked dirty. The service was good and everything else great but I'll come back again!"}
{"text":"We walk in first thinking this might be a cool place to eat while we watch batting practice. Nobody greets us so we sit down at a table that is filthy. Then a server comes and apologize about the dirty table and cleans it. The menu is very limited and the server tell me they will not make ANY modifications to menu items. I even asked for the chicken burrito minus the chicken and he went back to the kitchen and they still said no. All I wanted was a bean and cheese burrito and they would not do that for me. At this point I'm starting to realize why the place is empty. We have our drinks and my son orders the cheese quesadilla that is burnt.  The reason why I give this place one star is because the server was cool and made us comfortable."}
{"text":"Brandon and Kyra were happy to see me on a sunny Scottdale Saturday at the bar with a massive amount of chicken nachos for 8 bucks during happy hour. The chicken was that spicy kind of stringy stuff. It was really good with black beans. These two servers found a way to be polite, converse a bit, smile, while they were very busy. And hats off to Kyra's whole family for their service to our country."}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I decided to visit this location after being thrilled with the recent facelift and menu upgrades to the Salty's in Scottsdale. Unfortunately and fortunately, our mediocre at best experience here has also reminded me to leave the Scottsdale location a stellar review (sorry Peoria!).   We went on a Sunday and this place was ghost town dead. At first impression, this place seems like a cool hangout for weekend get togethers, but upon further look, you can definitely tell this place is in serious need of a facelift. The columns are missing chunks of tile, the tables and barstools have seen better days and are falling apart, and one of the tvs we couldn't tell if it was just old or if there was some dried substance running down it. Overall the place just looks dark and dirty. On to the food....  The menu at this location is not the same updated menu from the Scottsdale location but still has similar dishes. We opted for \"tableside\" guac (our favorite), and the fundido. The appetizers came out lightening fast, which you would think is a good thing, but it was almost too fast. The guac was brought out to us rather than made tableside  and had brown oxidation and oil separated from the dip like it had been sitting out all day. You could tell from the taste as well it was not fresh. The fundido was similar, like congealed velveeta that had been sitting out too long. We also had to separate some chips out from our basket because they were soggy with oil. For entree we shared a 6 taco basket with chicken tinga, grilled steak, the mahi taco, and the breaded fish taco. My boyfriend described the tinga as \"alright\" and while the flavor of the steak was good, the pieces were minced so small that the texture was unappealing, almost like dog food. The chipotle crema saved the mahi taco but I think the taco was missing avocado slices, I couldnt remember from the menu if that was supposed to be included or not. The breaded fish taco was okay but was missing both avocado and sauce as described which was disappointing. Unfortunately, we're now both at home with upset stomachs, headaches, and nausea :(  On the brightside, our server was nice and checked in on us often. No complaints there. Unfortunately this wasn't enough to convince us to return though; next time we'll probably go back to the Scottsdale location. It's sad, this place has so much potential I feel like they are just not taking advantage of."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here a couple weeks ago to try out the new location and were so impressed! Our server Annie (? Sorry if I got your name wrong girl!) was phenomenal and uber friendly. She went above and beyond to recommend drinks and food and make sure out visit was exceptional. We also enjoyed the new, simplified menu. The rockfish and chicken tacos were amazeballs and the recommended torta was just as good. I thought their fried pita chips with cilantro hummus was a cool twist and I couldn't get enough. Tableside guac was so good we scraped the bowl and my boyfriend went to town on the fundido with chorizo. The margarita she recommended was so refreshing and definitely left me 'floating' as promised. I cant remember the name but it was something made with don julio silver and lavender infusions, an unlikely but delicious pairing.  The new atmosphere is light and fun, definitely a cool hangout for a lazy Sunday afternoon. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  My high school reunion- I changed my mind a week before and decided to go. I didn't realize it was more bar than restaurant. My friend M rode down with me. I tried to tell her what my high school was like, but she had to experience it first hand. We parked and heard country music floating through as drunk people stumbled out. We walked in dressed in, or I should say overdressed in, black cocktail dresses. Everyone else was wearing tank tops and jeans. We were dressed to go to Scottsdale afterwards. My former classmates kept saying \"Why are you ditching us for  \"Snotsdale\"? Regardless I was happy to see everyone.  After some margaritas, yes we got them salty, I was right back in high school. It was fun catching up with everyone. M. got hit on by Mr. Popular who was a year ahead of our class. I don't even know why he attended our reunion, but his pick up line was classy. \"I've noticed you all night, you're cute. Come here. Do you know who I am?\" M's reaction, \"Um..... no thanks. I have no idea who you are. I didn't go to this high school.\"   It was relaxed and casual. They had good cheap margaritas. I wouldn't mind going back. I'll be found in tank top and jeans, the token Asian."}
{"text":"This is a place to ge when you want to raise hell with your friends... it is a fun place with the right crowd, but for sure not a location if you are searching for great food."}
{"text":"Oh you Senorita, somehow you are a strange antidote the end of a week. When I decided to plan Happy Hour for my co workers we were looking for someplace casual and low key with Margaritas and snack. I was also personally hoping for a little volleyball. So off to Silly Senorita, I mean Salty Senorita we go.  Yup they have a volleyball court , chips and yummy guac  as well as powerful house margs.  Now I haven't been much of a happy hour person lin the last couple of years but I was surprised how unhelpful and slow there staff was at 4:00 pm on a Friday , were they waiting for more waitresses to show up ? Were they overwhelmed by the 2 people sitting at the bar? Were we sitting too far away with our group of fifteen to be noticed? Whatever.. The drinks were cheap and strong ( insert joke here) and my co workers with toddlers felt comfortable to bring their kids ( yup Amber )   It's way casual  you could smuggle just about anything into the place. With service so slow I was thinking of bringing my own ice chests next time.   I 'll be back becuase it was so easy and outside and cheap in a good way.  Happy Hour anyone?"}
{"text":"I loveddddd the old salty senorita they had great burritos, fundado cheese dip and steak salad and of course margarita and great happy hour. I never thou a new location will change this place . I order my appetizer and a margarita and they didn't have frozen machine yet OK I can understand its a new location... we placed our orders and I want it to try something different I order chicken burrito and a chicken fajita order. First we never got the appetizer and the main course was not good my rice was hard and looks and taste old, the beans were hard the chicken was ok . I ask for the hot sauces on the side and they put inside. At the end we order another round of drinks cause we need a drink after eating that and we never got our drinks. Service was OK I guess. All im saying I know they are new and all... But please bring my old salty senorita back !!!!! you guys can do it."}
{"text":"We went just to have appetizer and a couple beers to pass some time. The service was pretty bad. Took about 10 minutes after being there for anyone to come by and ask us about drinks or menus. Ordered a Corona and got Coors instead. Other than that the environment is pretty good. Seems like there is always a good turnout.`"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch during the week. The menu is short, but everyone enjoyed their food. Warning: if you order a bowel it is huge! If ordering tacos I would say get 2-3 or you will be wanting more. I had the tamale and it was very tasty. I wouldn't say life changing but decent.  The ambiance was great and the service was very friendly. They also have an extensive patio and outdoor area that looked nice, but it was 110 so we didn't venture outside. I also really loved the decor, really cool looking light fixtures.  The reason I am only giving 4 stars is the drinks. The water they served us had this salty or metallic taste-yuck. The margaritas we ordered were so weak they tasted like a 7-11 slurpie and the pitcher didn't even full 5 drinks."}
{"text":"Went here because we were craving Mexican food. We live in Scottsdale and have always wanted to try this place! We wanted to sit outside but it was chilly and the manager was nice enough to move a heater right next to us to make sure we were comfortable. Our server was Maria and she was so fun and provided awesome and quick service! The food and drinks were great and my husband and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Food is improved from what they used to serve but they got rid of their good tequila selection. How dare you!!"}
{"text":"I  go to Arizona at least twice a year and I have to stop into salty before i leave. the outdoor venue is nice, people and staff are friendly  and you cant beat 2 dollar pacificos .Ill be in the Phoenix area  early july so ill be at saltys without a doubt"}
{"text":"I was supposed to come here once before but didn't get to. Supposedly they don't have a whole lot of food to choose from? But I came here last Saturday night and it was so much fun! What I really like about this place is there is a dance floor, however it's outside and there's only a little bit of indoor seating, but there's a pool table, a ping pong table, and a foosball table. You do have to pay for those though. But we played pool and that was fun! I think it's like a dollar. There's also an atm inside which comes in handy. Also there's this punching machine that you'll also find at the Main Event. If you've ever been there, you'll know what I'm talking about. Oh and one of the times my best friend and I were walking out there, they had misters blasting with a fan. Idk why more restaurants don't do this, cause man was it awesome. It felt so good. Especially with it being so freaking hot outside. And the lights hanging outside made it look classy. Really cute. As far as drinks go. I only got a dos Equis and than my best friend wanted something sweet where you couldn't taste alcohol and this girl (I don't remember her name) made her own concoction. There's no name for it. But it was really good. It had vodka, captain Morgan, peach snobs, OJ and cranberry juice. Very pleased. I'm not much for alcohol now. So this was a good drink for me to try."}
{"text":"Go if you want to have drinks on the patio on a nice day.  Just expect to have to go to the bar to get your drinks because the service is not great .  The food isn't great on their normal menu and even worse on the spring training menu.  It's fun to have drinks at and play games outside."}
{"text":"I've been by many times and always wanted to stop. Was walking around Old Town this last weekend and stopped in.  The place wasn't very busy yet for the lunch crowd and it still took some time to get seated. The staff seemed to be scrambling. Once we got seated it took a while to get our orders taken. We were mostly just stopping in for a couple drinks, no food. Two of us had the Salty Senorita and one ordered a different drink. The SM's were ok, nothing special even a little too bitter. The other drink was supposed to have some grapefruit slices in it. When it came it looked like 7-Up. We asked the waitress and she brought over the fruit to put in it.   Waitress disappeared for a long time. Got another drink. Then the check and left. She was friendly though.  I was really looking forward to this place and was let down. Too many good places in Scottsdale to deal with this. I may give it another try next time I'm back but who knows."}
{"text":"I went here when the new location first opened. So naturally it was pretty busy on a Saturday night. We had to wait awhile for a table, however luckily there is lots of bar space and benches around.  Once we got sat the service was great. Very fast and good food recommendations.  We both ordered tacos and they were good. Not the best in the world but good.  I think my favorite dish there was the chips and guacamole. Excellent and made at the table!  The ambiance is more of a casual bar scene. So a great place to go hangout with friends. Overall we enjoyed ourselves. Not the best food. But would go back for social outings."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday morning with 5 friends. It is not over exaggerating to say that the server would only come around every 25 minutes. The busser was nice enough to grab us waters and another server came away from her section just to take our orders since our server was no where to be found. It took longer to get our food order in than the food itself took to cook.. also our food came out before our second round of drinks which were ordered at the same time. Thumbs down for the server, thumbs down for the bartender but both the cooks and their food earn a definite thumbs up! Probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Everyone here is complaining about this place not being the old Salty's. I wouldn't even mind that as much as I loved the old Salty's. The problem is that the it's a taco place without any Taco Tuesday special, the prices are $3 or more a taco and the service is not the best. Not to mention the salsa isn't good either. Too many strikes on a taco joint.  They bring out all of the tacos on paddles and you have to sort it out yourself. Bad situation when you've got 10 people at a table and they don't even get all the tacos. The patio is nice and the food is good but honestly it's just not worth it when it comes to price and service. In Arizona there are much better options. I hope I don't find myself here anytime soon. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We were here last Saturday and the food was amazing. Service was slow, but ok. The real problem came when we found out that the server decided to take it upon herself to write in an additional $20 tip on the credit card receipt when we left a $20 bill (20% tip) on the table for her. The manager agreed to refund the $20 when called about it, but we will not be back because of this. You should not have to worry that your server will steal from you when you pay your bill. Theft is unacceptable."}
{"text":"My 73 year old mother LOVES this place.  no seriously. She loves the food and the atmosphere. She loves the taco flights. She loves the margaritas. She loves the service. She lives in the neighborhood and always brings out of town guests here to sit on the patio. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"This is my go to in Peoria but this was the worst experience I have ever had. Terrible service"}
{"text":"The crowded patio attracted me to this place.  The décor and ambiance is pretty cool.  Once I found out they put Sprite in their margaritas I wanted to leave.  Ugh.  Soda does not belong in a margarita.  They even out it in their skinny one which well negates the purpose.  And tastes terrible.    I am glad I stayed because the taco Tuesday deal was a good value and the tacos were tasty.  I had the chicken and the carne asada.  Liked them both.  Seasoned very well.  Our waitress was nice but she brought every table chips except for us.  Multiple baskets to one table but never any to us.  Not sure whether chips and salsa are an appetizer that you have to pay for.  Could be.  If that's the case charging for chips is lame.  If not the case the waitress dropped the ball.  Wasn't a terrible experience and like I said the tacos were tasty.  But margaritas are important to me at restaurants and if they can't get them right I probably won't return."}
{"text":"This place has friendly service, but the food is unfortunately mediocre wannabe Mexican, based on what we ordered. The carnitas were like jerky, and the coca-cola shredded beef tamale was an unsuccessful attempt at reinvention: the meat was fine, but it was sitting on a plank of deep fried masa that was as dense and tasteless as dried out play-dough. The molten lava cake was anything but--also very dry--but at least it was warm and the ice cream had magic shell on it. Nice throwback. Also, the patio has portable AC, which adds a star for comfort. Glad we had a Groupon. Go for drinks if you're in the area, sit by the AC on the patio and enjoy the standard chips and salsa, and the sights and sounds of Old Town."}
{"text":"I am sorry, but those of you from AZ who gave this good reviews must have some bland pallets.  This placa is AWFUL.   We were a group of nearly 20 on 5/31 and ordered off the menu. Many of us did not even recognize the menu.  Who puts cucumbers in tacos? Who deep fries a tamale? And NO enchiladas?   Several of us ordered the steak fajitas because it was close to what we were used to.  Now understand we were from CA, TX, ID, GA, IL, MO, FL and WI.  And we all agreed that the food was seriously bland.  The steak, though tender had not flavor at all.  And the onions and peppers served w/the fajitas were soggy.  The margaritas were bland as well. So I switched to domestic beer.   Lastly, we were eating inside and it was extremely warm.  The bathrooms were cooler than the dining area.  Kudos for the tomatillo salsa.  Follow that lead with seasoning and MAYBE you have something."}
{"text":"I am giving it 3 stars for the ambiance - It's all outside, volleyball and cornhole, a view of a baseball field. You could probably even go barefoot. But they were very slow bringing out food and drink. Also, they have TV'S outside, but most are broken! The biggest problem is that they have no beers on tap! Really?! Who goes to a bar for bottled beer? Great bones but poorly executed..."}
{"text":"I really, really want Saltys to be a cool place to go for breakfast on Sundays. There just aren't many options and those are all indoors and packed.   They just seem surprised every Sunday morning when people show up and want to eat.   They have these really cool omelette forms that you can fill out to build your own. The last 3 times I went there they were out of them shortly after opening. Once they told us the manager was making copies. Came back 20 minutes later with torn pieces of paper.   We had a party of ten a few weeks ago and one didn't get their food for an hour and 20 minutes. The waitress kept asking if we had told the person who delivered our food.   I finally went to the manager, who was totally unaware of the problem.  They need to hire ONE PERSON who knows how to run a food operation so he or she can tell the rest of them the basics.   It is such a cool place to take people before spring training. It's too bad they haven't got a clue in the world of how to run a food operation."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars to go to already. But this last time was the best experience I've ever had at a restaurant. We were there for Cinco de Mayo and the party was incredible. I was apprehensive to go out because I didn't think we would receive any service due to the huge crowd. Our server Leia noticed us right away; super friendly and attentive. She made my wife and i feel like we were senators; super vip service. In a sea of people, she was able to go way above and beyond and make sure the service we received was unmatched. And it was. It's not often you see people who give 110% these days. I hope someone recognizes this about her. We certainly did!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok...I ordered a breakfast burrito... the eggs tasted watery. Ate half and left the rest. The potatoes that came with it were too greasy... left those too. Bloody Mary bar was OK.... bottomless mimosas had mostly oj in it. It was just ok. Waitress was really nice, staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Decent place for drinks- good indoor/outdoor experience. Very laid back, but almost too laid back. Their bathrooms were not in good shape- the doors were both broken and not very clean at all, glad we didn't get food here and just got drinks!"}
{"text":"We usually go to Fuzzy's for taco Tuesday. We tried this place instead this week. The service was horrible and the food was too. The presentation was sloppy and the salsa was all over the side of the cups and you could tell that it was scooped out of whatever it came from. Fuzzy's is much more busy, but they are able to better serve customers. We will continue to go to Fuzzy's and encourage others to do so as well. Update: we had to order twice and our order was messed up and were overcharged $22.31. But we paid it just to get out of there faster. We had to ask for our check 3 times."}
{"text":"If there were zero stars, that still wouldn't be low enough for this place. My husband and I came in one afternoon and each had one beer. When we went to cash out about 10 minutes later, their systems were down. They had our credit card, but couldn't close out, because the system had crashed. Initially we waited patiently. After 30 minutes had passed, we still sat there waiting for their system to be working. At that point, we had somewhere to be. The male working the bar kept saying, \"the manager is trying to get the system working. Have another drink and we will get it working.\" After 45 minutes, we were still waiting for their system to work. The people working the bar, particularly the male, was a rude tool bag. Probably the absolute most inconsiderate human being we've ever come across.   We knew the system crashing was not his fault, but in no way was it our fault either. Don't tell us to \"have another drink,\" when we had been patiently waiting for their system to work for 45 minutes. It was absolutely ridiculous. Don't waste your time going here. I'd rather brew beer in my toilet and drink that instead. Cheers."}
{"text":"To me this place is just okay.  The drinks are okay, I don't love nor hate them and the food is okay.  In trying to write this review there's nothing really memorable about the whole place.  Nothing negative which is a good thing, but nothing positive either.  This place is easily forgettable and a little bit boring to me and my friends when we went.  I don't see myself returning there anytime soon."}
{"text":"So, I came here after the new location opened. I was sad because service was slow or simply missing in action, BUT I am so glad I returned!  They've got their stuff together now! Service for brunch today was fabulous.  I never saw the bottom of my mimosa glass and the food has improved greatly. We will be back!!! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"This review has been a long time coming. I go here with my girlies when we are craving a margarita and fundido. That is THE only reason why we choose this place. Other than location as it is closer to us. Their margaritas are okay, I usually get the Pom Pom. But lately it's rare when we get a good glass of it. Lately it's very syrupy or too sour.   Last night was a good example of why I give this place two stars. My girls and I get there at 9:30pm, we are ignored by the waitress for fifteen minutes. She saw us first arrive and continued to serve her other tables. After fifteen minutes, my friend gets up and walks to the table behind us where the server is chatting personally with and asks if we could get service. She comes to our table and asks if we wants menus. She brings us menus. Ten minutes later, it's been 25 minutes now that we have been here. We have no drinks, just menus. She finally comes back over after we flag her down again. We ask for a manager and put in an order. It's now past 10pm and we are hungry, and there's no other place open around to go to if we leave.   Manager comes over and gives us ten reasons and excuses as to why we probably weren't served within reasonable time. Finally he apologizes and says he'll take care of some things for us on our tab. Our server comes over with our drinks and finally apologizes. Okay, no problem you're forgiven. The night goes well after that... We order a second round of drinks and they're disgusting. We send them back and ask for our tab. The waitress apologizes. The manager comes over and says he took a drink off for each of us to make up for waiting.... I tell him \"You mean the one drink we sent back... and didn't drink?\" (We only ordered two total drinks each.) He says \"damnit\", walks away, and never does anything to take care of us.   Every time I come here it takes so long to get service. But the fundido is delicious that we can't resist coming once every six months.... after we have forgotten how bad the service usually is."}
{"text":"Happy hour lasts from 3-7pm. $4 margaritas and beers are cheaper at $2-3 a bottle. Fat Tire was the closes thing I could get to a dark beer, but I kind of expected that seeing as how I'm not at a brewery. I'm at a Mexican cantina type place, so no worries there!  Service was decent. Waiters and waitresses were pretty attentive initially around 5-7pm, but then as the night proceeded on and more and more people came strolling in, then the service started to go on the wayside a bit. Our poor waitress was running inside to our table and then going back outside to take care of patrons sitting out there as well.   Food? As far as happy hour food goes, it is affordable to say the least. The cheese fundido dip with chips seemed to be the \"go-to\" for a lot of people. I also enjoyed the taquitos with guacamole. I wasn't overly impressed with the food, but it's happy hour food and it was decent, and it was absorbing the beer and margarita consumption fairly well, so my friends and I were content and happy.   There's plenty of activities to be involved in outside. The stretch of sand where corn hole was played was right next to one of the baseball fields with a nice view of the sunset. There is also one nice sand volleyball court that was busy all night. As laid back as the place was I was surprised to see the crowd really \"get down\" with the DJ playing. Overall, it seems like a fun place to hang out at. I should know, we ended up staying there until 11ish that evening when we were supposed to stay just for happy hour."}
{"text":"If there was a bar with an 'end of the world' theme...this place would be it. From the mosquito infested pool in the front to the booster seats available on demand...this place gets a fail for atmosphere. Perhaps it's to get you drinking faster and longer.  I went here with a friend for happy hour because it was convenient and any place with Rada is an ok place to be... sadly. I just couldn't get past the doomsday decor and the lack of meatless things. I'll stick to snobbsdale's location"}
{"text":"The wife and I had a great night over at the Salty this past weekend. The food and service were great! Loved the vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been coming year for literally 10 years. Went tonight for the first time in 2 years... Food was horrible, service was even worse. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Long wait for a table, despite tables clearly being open. After seated waited 20 minutes for a server, and then another 20 to get our drink orders. The worst margarita I've ever had in my life. When discussing margaritas with waitress she rolled her eyes at me as if it was my fault the margaritas were bad. Manager tried to help us but he failed to fix any of the issues. Thoroughly disappointed with every aspect of my visit, especially how terrible the margaritas were. Won't come back for quite awhile, if ever."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. We had 6 people at our table and they gave us one single bowl of chips with one thing of salsa. It also took 30 minutes to get our waters out, and I would totally understand if they were busy. But the hostess was on her phone texting the whole time, so it was tough finding an excuse for the service to be as bad as it was. Also when the runner came, he had no idea about seat numbers and call us out by our food like it was a raffle. Just a weird experience I hope I don't go back"}
{"text":"I had been here on one previous occasion. As much as like spending my time with the geriatrics of Sun City, I've found I need to venture further outside of Surprise to find the X/Y generation. So, I did. For Happy Hour. After spending time with with good peeps, 4 street tacos, and Two Exes (the beer, silly. Two exes at the same time? Not me.) I had claimed Salty Seniorita safe, and acceptable. Naomi, our server, was great, too.  Stop the show. I had a lapse in judgement. I'm sorry. I went back with my gf on St. Patty's day. Well, night actually. It was windy, and stormy. Cool change of weather. Our server was attentive and nice. Can you tell I'm holding out? I'm refraining from going on about how bad the food was. But I cannot help it now. The chips and salsa are so bland and plain. The salsa is like hot watery cilantro puree. Flat, bland, and uninspiring. And... they charge you $2 for the pleasure. Are you kidding me?   My gf ordered the taco salad with BLACKENED Mahi. The fish came out under cooked and mushy. Not even an attempt at the blackened part of the equation. The salad was a heap of shit. Just a pile of stuff thrown haphazardly into a shell, that was food colored green. Maybe it was a spinach taco shell, but it looked like a food colored taco shell.   I ordered the fajitas. I pulled SEVERAL large chunks of gristly meat out of the plate. The shrimp was poorly packaged, over frozen, overcooked, and tasted flat and bland. That was after I had picked through the onions. Also, someone may want to put an APB out on the Bell Pepper. Large, green, red, or orange type pepper found in fajitas and other dishes. Mine had escaped. Yes. really. No bell peppers in my fajitas. The beans were canned Rosarita beans. Same bland garbage that can be bought in a store. Black beans, canned as well.   So why the 2 stars? The drinks were good. They have a margarita that is fresh squeezed and made from scratch that is awesome. The mango marg is great, my gf liked the Prickly Pear marg, and the house marg is not bad. Service was good too.   If they got the food on par with the service and the drinks, this would be THE place to go in the West Valley."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times the service sucked. And the food was not good. The only thing that I can say is good is the spinach queaso dip.   We say outside by the outside bar/drink location and we watched several employees walk up reach there cups and hands in the ice bin !!! Yuck !!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here before but just got chips and margaritas. This time we went for food. It wad nice that we didn't have to wait for a table during lunch time in Old Town on a Sunday but after eating and our service, we found out why.  Our server was polite but for a place that wasn't very busy, she forgot that we ordered appetizers and was incredibly slow.  The food was very disappointing. It was borderline cold and just not very good. Kids chicken strips were dry, my shrimp bowl was terrible and the burrito was ok. We could have done better at Chipotle."}
{"text":"I love going to Salty Señorita! It is a fun fun atmosphere and their margaritas are good. We waited for over 20 mins outside before getting any service (we had to move inside). It was busy so I totally get it. It's a wonderful place to stop in and get some good food and drinks!"}
{"text":"sad to see and say it, but the majority of the previous reviews have pretty much said it all. we use to love stopping by on our bikes and sipping some cocktails or having some light eats at the old location. but sadly, no mas.... for starters, it's right across the street from that dreadful other hangout, with their techno and club music blasting.  we ordered a couple of margaritas. mine, the house margarita, was 9 bucks. my wife ordered \"their most popular margarita\"....it cost 11 bucks! the price of those margaritas alone is enough to get us great food at other locations in the area! we ordered 3 tacos and thought 3 bucks was high, and were expecting these fish and octopus filled, large tacos.  instead, we got these teeny, tiny tacos with about 2 slivers of fish/octopus...which could be eaten in 1 bite....for 3 bucks!!! what a joke! and to make it even worse, the fish and the octopus were way too chewy.  i have to say, our service was good and it wasn't crazy busy at noon on a sunday, but we both agreed, we can get much better/larger portions of food for the money at numerous other old town locations."}
{"text":"We had a party for 10 at 7 pm but only 4 of us showed. The other guests came later. This was a birthday party but that didn't stop them from bugging the birthday girl about how they needed to take some tables away. The manager had tables open so it was unclear why he was insisted on pestering her.  Service: pretty shitty. Took only some of our drink order before we had to flag her down. It appeared that we had to flag her down for everything. One guest had to go to the bar to get a drink because it took so long and the server gave her shit about it.  Food: the guacamole was amazing and the only reason I'm giving them 2 stars. The black beans were inedible and the rice was good.   So if you want Mexican food, go somewhere else. I would only go back for the guacamole. Otherwise, don't bother."}
{"text":"Still amazed by this place! They need to open more locations! Fun, fun, and fun atmosphere! Always enjoy coming here!"}
{"text":"First time here went like this.   FOOD: Low prices (for the area) but barely above Taco Bell in quality. Some of the worst mexican food I've ever had. Everyone at my table thoroughly disappointed. I personally had the Chipotle Chicken burrito. If it wasn't for the fact I was starving, I literally wouldn't have ate past the first few bites. I've never experienced such bland food from a restaurant in a very long time and I'm shocked they're able to stay in business, in such a prime area, serving microwaveable quality mexican food.   SERVER: Didn't know basic ingredients that were contained in menu items when asked. Took too long to grab four (cans) of beer. Took WAY too long to get the bill and get card back so we could leave this dump.   HOSTING: When asked to be seated on the patio, the hostess sat us in the BACK PATIO (where nobody was sitting), not the front patio along Scottsdale Rd. where everyone else was seated and there was plenty of room. Request to be reseated at the front was met with disgust.   AMBIANCE: Try-hard baja feel. Woulda been into it slightly more had everything else been better. Random ass soundtrack playing too.   Stay away."}
{"text":"EWWW this place is ratchet. Plz, take my advice, and don't let the nice aesthetics deceive you! The margarita I had here tasted like bath water mixed with Clorox. They even served it to me in a red Solo cup-- I am not sure why because other people got normal glasses. Good vibes here b/c of the outdoor patio, but the service was sh*t (granted, I only went once) and the alcohol was actually AWFUL. Please, if you want a decent drink go ANYWHERE ELSE. If you want a great drink, all you have to do is cross the street and go to RnR..."}
{"text":"Nice looking place on the outside in the heart of the local art district. Unfortunately, this pretty senorita should stay out of the kitchen. The food arrived barely warm. I sent it back and it arrived barely warm again. By the third attempt it was hot but awful and inedible. The wait staff was friendly and apologetic. They didn't even charge me for the uneaten dreck. But still, I left hungry and a bit angry at the overall incompetence. I should have known better just from the ugly bathroom alone. Stay away. This place is done, but don't put a fork in it!"}
{"text":"My sister in law's birthday was held here and I felt like I was drinking fun drinks and not only beer at a Monastery. (shhh, i know..)  Waitress RAN to get our orders. I'm not even kidding."}
{"text":"This place is the spot if your looking to drink in a group! The outdoor activities and ambiance is amazing! It just screams fun and the vibe is off the charts! Makes me feel like I'm at the beach! Outdoor volleyball, horseshoes, and a view of the Peoria Sports Complex baseball games really cool!"}
{"text":"Margaritas selection was large and unique. I really enjoyed everything I tried and the service was great and speedy! I went on a Thursday though!"}
{"text":"I used to come here when it was The Monastery and you could grill your own burgers. Loved the place then. Tonight, out of the blue I thought of coming to the now Salty Senoritas. I'm sad to say that this place seems like it has gone down hill. It has so much potential and whoever owns it is letting it go to crap. First, we ask if there is any wood for the fire pits (waitress said not enough to make a good fire...we found enough to make a decent one), we ask to have the patio heaters turned on (no propane), they are out of lemons, out of the Estella's fish tacos and out of CORONA (I read a sign they are the home of $3 Coronas everyday)! The chips were cold... Just disappointing. Things are falling apart and look like crap. Bathrooms still suck.  I hope they read these reviews and put a little elbow grease into the place and make sure they order enough stuff to get you through the night! Yes, I will be back to see if maybe we came on an off night. I'm just not sure if it will be anytime soon. Hope it will still be open by then."}
{"text":"Jeramy knows how to treat my liver right! The guy is one of the best bartenders to ever play the game. Saltys made a great decision!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress and hostesses are too concerned with themselves to provide decent customer service. Used to be an average place but has taken a turn for the worse. The food is bland and not authentic,  pairing that with rude servers.. thats a no go"}
{"text":"I'm not happy at all with this place. I've been sitting with an empty glass the entire time I've had my food. The chicken burrito is bland and I had two bites of it. I ordered the chips and salsa (with 3 salsas) only received one and when I asked where my other salsas are she told me that's not what I ordered..... My friends ordered chicken and shrimp fajitas and they got shrimp and steak (my friend can't eat steak). I almost feel like I'm a burden eating here. This place may look packed and like a wonderful place but I suggest going to another place if you're craving Mexican."}
{"text":"Bad service? How about NO SERVICE! I was at the \"Sodium Chloride Stuffed Female\" for 3.5 hours and never once was I approached by a server, greeted, offered a menu or asked if I needed anything; for three and a half hours!! I saw plenty of servers; young ladies more interested in chatting up the young men at the next table over, but never once was approached. Even the bartender seemed bothered to open a couple of bottles of beer for me and my lady. And bottle were all they had. Even the tap system wasn't working and there was no draft beer!!!   It's too bad, really, how crappy this place is on service. With an outdoor volley ball court, fire pits, and more, I would have really enjoyed lingering and coming back. As it was, the only reason we were there was a friend's birthday. But since I was never offered food, or drinks, one server even just walked past out table as we yelled \"Shots! Shots!\" And would have just walked away if we hadn't grabbed her and demanded service. This place must be losing $1000s of dollars a night if they treat others the way they treated us. I won't be going back to a place that clearly doesn't value it's customers. I can put up with a lot if I can get good service, but the Salty Señorita isn't worth tolerating."}
{"text":"The salty seniorRita in Scottsdale is a great joint. Very generous happy hour. Very good staff. Huge portions and the prices are very reasonable. The nachos are amazing. The burritos are very good and very large. Two dollar fireball shots. Five dollar margaritas. Try it out"}
{"text":"Walked over to this place after being put off by the unfriendliness of the staff at Los Olivos.   I'm glad we walked down the street because The Salty Señorita had  friendly and attentive staff. The short rib nachos we're delicious.  Also had a trio of tacos, which were tasty, although everything was a bit, um, salty (it's in the name of the place, so go figure).  Our margaritas (house) were really good too.  I'll return when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Tried this place again 3 years later... all I can say again that our food sucked. But other people in our party thought it was pretty good. Boyfriend and I didn't think so. Doubt we will be back for a third time..."}
{"text":"Delicious margaritas! Food is typical bar food, tacos are very good though. Fun outdoor activities but wouldn't necessarily bring the littles as there was glass in the houseshoe area."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"meh\".  I have been here on several occasions and I'm never impressed.  However...the environment is cool...the food and service leave a lot to be desired!    I should probably mention that I do not eat here...strictly a happy hour place.  I had a HORRIBLE experience at one of their other locations a few years ago...one so bad that even after several years, I refuse to eat the food."}
{"text":"This place isn't all that, the food was low quality for high prices and the whole place really needs to be deep cleaned. The outside of it is really cool, kind of a beachy atmosphere with beach volley ball and horse shoes. The tables inside were dirty the TV inside looks like there was dried on blood running down. The only reason I went was because of Groupon, that's the last time I do that. I went last winter on a Wednesday for happy hour and got 10 cents wings, I guess if I ever go back it'll only be on a Wednesday."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place has gone downhill.  The service is barely adequate.  The food is really uninspired. My chicken lunch box came with soup and they didn't even give me a spoon to eat it with until ten minutes after my food was delivered. They do have a nice front patio to have a couple of drinks but that's about all that is even remotely enjoyable at the Salty Senorita these days."}
{"text":"Happy hour is from 3pm-7pm and they do have well drinks which is not bad however what Mexican food place doesn't offer chips and salsa when you initially  sit down plus they don't even have taco Tuesday? Service is understaffed and waitress word for word said \"I have a lot of tables do you need anything else before I leave because I won't be back soon\"? Did she even want a tip? First time and not impressed."}
{"text":"Food was ok, my fajitas were over cooked. Service is lousy. Appetizers came out after the entree. Our server was indifferent. Overall it's just another tourist trap."}
{"text":"I went on a Friday night - we were very surprised to see that it wasn't very busy. We sat outside, along with the rest of the diners - there were zero people sitting inside (no exaggeration)! The tables, menus, and overall ambiance were very casual. Long list of signature margaritas - how could you go wrong?! I had \"The Black Out,\" which was infused with jalapenos, upon recommendation by the waitress. It was delicious!   Our food was okay. I had the Chicken Tinga tacos, and my boyfriend had fajitas. Nothing was amazing, but we weren't disappointed. The best part of our dinner was enjoying the atmosphere and not being rushed by our waitress to eat and leave. Good service!"}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times since my first review.  They continue to be spot on with service, very friendly, and the fact that the manager reached out to me to thank me for a review, shows these folks care about their customers.  I'd happily go to Salty's for VB and beers anytime!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself very much. My sister was visiting in town and we wanted to go to a relaxed atmosphere that served good drinks. We found our place. It was a Friday afternoon we had a couple of margaritas as well as fajitas and fish tacos. Delicious. Our waitress was friendly. It was a cool day. Salty's has a spacious patio on the front and the back. Lots of opportunities to people watch."}
{"text":"A must stop after day baseball!  We come here after every Giants home games.  Outdoor seating right along Scottsdale Road!"}
{"text":"Place to hang out after game for a few drinks. Had some fish tacos that had a strange smell. Below average service.  Not a fan"}
{"text":"The male bartenders are horrible. Rude with no personality. DO NOT GO on the weekdays. Weekends are the only time you can get decent service. You'd think they'd be great for the fact they're only busy 2 months out of the year. Could be an awesome place of the service improved. ."}
{"text":"Great place to hang and suck a cold one down! Bartenders Samantha, Ben and Kyra awesome! Cheers! machaca crisp and street tacos wonderful flavors... beer is really cold as well"}
{"text":"So I'm sitting at RnR on a Tuesday night when Salty Senorita turns their music up so loud that I can't hear myself think on the RnR patio. I call Salty Senorita. No answer. I call again and someone answers. I tell them I'm a guest across the street and it's unbearably loud. They respond, \"What?!\" and hang up. What a joke."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place for the food but they get 3 stars because it seems like every time I come, the service is great until it you start wrapping up your meal and are looking for your check. It's like they can sense when you're not going to order more and they put their attention elsewhere.   Other than that, I like their tacos. They're on the smaller side but they're yummy and only $3 a taco. Come during happy hour for cheap tacos and beer bottles. I think they have a Bloody Mary bar on weekends too if you're into that."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill.  Got the fish tacos and they were terrible.  The margarita was nothing but syrup.  I think I will be sick.  I know I won't be back."}
{"text":"While looking for something different we couldn't avoid the great patio if this place and stopped in.  Not knowing anything about the previous location referenced in reviews here I can offer a review on face value.....  I liked the tacos quite a bit, upscale in the way of tacos but very tasty at $3 each.  The margaritas we had were extremely strong...I don't usually complain about this other than we had to add water to make them drinkable.  But overall, loved the live music and service was great."}
{"text":"First time visit. I sat inside with a group of six around 8pm. Service was pretty good, but food was definitely of below average quality. Especially for the price. I thought the food would make up for the exceptionally sweet, and definitely a store bought mix, margarita, but it didn't. Outdoor area seemed nice, and it was extremely busy. Probably wont be going back. Pricy food for what you get, pricy drinks unless it's happy hour, and awful margaritas."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat after a Spring Training game at Scottsdale Stadium. We hopped a golf cart and headed to a place I wanted to try; it was not open, yet. The cart driver suggested Salty's. I wish we had discovered this place a couple of days ago. While we were enjoying excellent street tacos and Salty's Original Fundido we were reading reviews. We could not understand all the negative reviews. The food was excellent and Markell provided us with top notch service. Ignore all those negative reviews. Grab a table on the patio and have some fun with friends."}
{"text":"I give 2 stars only for atmosphere because the food is only worth 1 star. The patio is beautiful with nice heat lamps and great location. Beyond that everything falls apart. The margarita was very mediocre. I like the thin chips they serve (extra charge) but the salsa had weird flavor.  While we waited for our food to arrive, we had two different food runners try to serve us someone else's order. Many times we watched as food runners seemed lost and didn't know where to deliver the food. Then our food arrived after a bit of a wait but we weren't in a hurry.  My fish taco did not taste fresh and I was worried it might make me sick because it was so fishy tasting.   The Fajitas were BORING with no seasoning on the meat, weird black eyed beans that were undercooked and hard.  The most offensive was the rice ball that they served. Literally it was so over cooked, you could stick a fork in it and pick up the whole serving as a lump. It was like Japanese sticky rice.  This place has great potential if they get a decent cook. To be this close to the border and NOT have excellent Mexican food is really disappointing."}
{"text":"Not that impressed. Figured that tacos would be pretty cheap on \"Taco Tuesday\" like their website claims but prices were $6 for two street tacos. Pretty expensive for street tacos that weren't even that great. We shared the steak, the chicken, and the pork. The pork ones were the best. Also had the chips and salsa and the salsa is a little tiny cup.  The Fundido cheese dip was good however when I asked the waitress what kind of cheese was used she couldn't give me an answer. Also spent $7 each on a house margarita that is small and served in a plastic cup. Since it was kind of chilly outside we had to sit in the one last small table inside which was a high top. So if the weather isn't nice then I do not recommend coming because over 95% of their seating is outside."}
{"text":"The service is seriously lacking. Also there's a female bartender there that enjoys ignoring other females. Other than that, cheap specials. Fundido is good. This place is way too \"west valley\" for me so I probably won't be back, went for a friends birthday. If you enjoy mediocre service and bro dudes, this is your spot!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour with a big group. I'm going to give props to the waitress for splitting our tickets out accurately and without attitude. You'd be surprised how hard it is for some people to do that.   On to the food: - Chips and Salsa: Pretty horrible. Chips were stale and salsa was bland and a strange color.  - Salty Dog: This was a hot dog wrapped in bacon with guacamole and pico on top. I am definitely a fan of this combination. It also came with waffle fries (also great). Only reason I'm giving this place three stars and not two. - Chicken Tinga Nachos: My boyfriend got this and loved it. Huge portion of nachos loaded with cheese, beans, sour cream, pico, and chicken. It was suppose to have guacamole but guess they forgot. - Margaritas : This is what I was most disappointed about because I heard this place was suppose to make great tasting strong margaritas and mine was way too sweet/sour and seemed to have little to no tequila in it. Same with the two other people who ordered margaritas.   TV's were poor quality as we were watching the Heat/Celtics game. Only reason I am pointing this out is because this place has a sports bar feel to it. I probably will not come back again unless social situations force me to."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some apps and drinks after the dinner rush and got a great patio seat. We sampled most of the taco menu; coca cola beef rib and rock fish stick in my mind but all were good. Some of the drinks seemed too boozy but the half sangria half margarita was very good. Service was attentive and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The food here was real good. Beer was not cold....had to get a bucket of ice for it to chill. Needs a renovation yesterday.....Jon Taffer! !!! Place hasn't been cleaned in months. Wanted to play horseshoes and ping pong. ....no lights working. One volleyball court was all booked up. Probably won't be back.....until they remodel and clean."}
{"text":"The Happy Hour Nachos are really good. The Margaritas were a little weak. But my friend was the guy that needed a phone charger and they gave him this cool battery pack."}
{"text":"Best chicken tinga ever. If you are looking for traditional mexican food, look elsewhere. But for a modern twist on it Salty Senorita is a great choice"}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review. I'm currently at Saltys (previously one of my all time favorite bars 3+ years ago) and have been waiting for my server for 30 minutes so I can order another drink. When I first got here it took over 30 minutes to be acknowledged. I understand it's spring training season but they need to staff accordingly. However, the plus side is that my waitress has been super apologetic and doing her best which I greatly appreciate and know it's not her fault. BUT LETS TALK ABOUT THE BATHROOMS- the most disgusting and unsanitary bathroom in Phoenix. Hands down. I have to reach my hand into the tank to flush one of them, the floor was flooded, and every toilet was filled to the brim with toilet paper and body fluids. The bathrooms are UNACCEPTABLE. I'm sorry Salty's but I think the time for our break up has arrived."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me, extra $3 for chips and salsa... or even salsa if that's all you want put on your meal is this common in Phoenix? I can tell you the everywhere around this place was packed and this place is empty Margaritas on the outside patio otherwise nobody was eating actual food and now I know why. The heaters for sparse and sizzle at all. Just flour tortillas we're hard and it cost an extra if you wanted more than three. It was a very bad start to an otherwise good impression of the town on our first evening here. Do yourself a favor and choose otherwise"}
{"text":"This place has happy hour every day until 7pm which was nice- but we had terrible service.  The menu was not impressive. No exciting dishes- everyone got tacos in our group of six.  We were actually just sitting outside on a picnic table.  Very very casual."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant that we went to on a whim.  It's busy and loud, but the service was good and the food was tasty.  I had fish tacos and enjoyed them.  Wait staff was attentive and fast.  We sat on the patio, which was nice; the indoor dining looked just as nice.  Clearly a place for college kids, spring training baseball fans (mostly SF Giants), and tourists driving down Scottsdale Road or wandering over from Old Town.  But fast, cheap, and a nice little diversion if you're looking for something loose and casual."}
{"text":"It was my friends bachelorette celebration, so we decided to head here after a show at talking stick resort. We got there around 9PM tonight, Saturday night, and there were maybe 6 people inside and about 20 outside, it was deader than dead. The bartender was very friendly, we all ordered drinks and he was upbeat. The drinks were absolutely horrific. Two tequila sunrises and a vodka soda should be easy enough. We took them outside to enjoy the evening and hoped it would pick up. Got out there and we all about spit out our drinks they were so terrible. I tried to drink mine thinking maybe something wasn't right with me lol! Then my other friend said her drink was so bad she didn't think she could drink it. We decided enough was enough, between being dead as it gets to the worst drinks we ever had, it was time to bounce. Gave it 2 stars because the bartender was very nice. We didn't complain about the drinks since we weren't sure if he were to of comped them he'd have to eat the price himself. We left the drinks full at the table and headed out for the rest of the evening. I had heard this place was really fun and great drinks so needless to say, it was a massive let down."}
{"text":"I'm big on service. We were ignored when we entered the place. Sat down for another 10 minutes and no one approached us. We left & went to tilted kilt. I'm not giving any establishment my money who doesn't understand basic customer service skills."}
{"text":"Awful service is all I have to say.....10 mins for waitress to even show up, 20 mins to get chips and salsa (which cost money) after finally ordering, 15 min to get margarita after ordering , 30 min  to have ordered finally taken.....never an offer to refill drink or anything...... and it wasn't even very busy yet"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic as usual.  Staff is friendly and I never have to wait for service.  A+++"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVE the tacos here, in the past few months we have come here 5 times and each time, with a different server each time, we are treated the same- takes forever to get service, even with endless chips and salsa we have to go out of our way to get more chips then they leave before we can ask for more salsa. The service it terrible and it sucks because I love the tacos and the awesome environment"}
{"text":"Love the drinks and the food. Our service was amazing. Other reviews have said that it had gone downhill, but that was not my experience at all."}
{"text":"Awesome place to come sit on a patio and drink some really good drinks. Food is really good. I had the tinga chicken nachos and my friends had the Chipotle chicken burrito. Both were outstanding. Their chips and salsa are so good because the salsa is fire roasted. If you want a great drink try the El Pepin. Def coming back when I have a chance"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and had the tacos. I had a beef and a chicken taco, my husband had a beef and pork taco. The chicken and pork tacos were good. The beef tacos were dry and bland. They warned us before that the beef tacos were fried. I love fried tacos, but not these. The house margaritas were delicious. I am not sure we will ever return, but it was decent."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious. Thought we'd get your \"run of the mill\" bar food and were pleasantly surprised! You've got to try their Bistro Steak Asada tacos. They are small but full of flavor and yes, I'd pay $3 per SMALL taco again. They're that good."}
{"text":"Meh. We stopped in with the hope of finding a new option for Mexican food in our area. This is not the place.  I should have read the reviews first, my bad. The atmosphere seemed nice in the patio area, however, we were in the restaurant inside and it left a lot to be desired. The service was average at best and the food either had no flavor or was WAY too spicy to eat. The margaritas are pre-mixed and served in clear plastic SOLO cups. Not what I expected when I thought I was going to a Mexican restaurant. It didn't really even seem like Mexican food. It's moa place to get average tacos and pre-mixed drinks while you hang out on the patio.  The only reason I'm even giving 3 stars is because the queso was good. I put it on the rest of my food so I could taste it.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"i have been going here for years, one thing i loved about them was their RED salsa! so good! so hot! well me and my family go there last night and they bring out a tiny cup on GREEN salsa.. i ask the new waitress where is the red salsa, she said this is all we have, well i ask 2 other people, and they both are new also and they only know of the green salsa, well the menu says \"RED HOUSE SALSA\" i was very disappointed, that was probally the only reason i chose to go there. to top it off, the new waitress didnt know the taco tuesday specials but said they were cheaper than the menu price, when we got the bill they were the same price as the menu, so once again i had to find someone to figure out the bill! so i dont know if i will ever go back."}
{"text":"This was definitely our go-to place when we lived in Tempe. It's one of the few places that has queso in Arizona. Quick service, great queso and strong margaritas (well sometimes) is why we go back.   Also, we loved having Taylore as our waitress. She's great and always remembered our order."}
{"text":"The first time we went, our service was the worst I've ever had. Food was good. BUT the manager handled it well and we ended up coming back to use our free appetizer card. It's an enjoyable atmosphere and everything was good besides the one time we had bad service. They are working on staffing though so I'm sure it's fixed by now."}
{"text":"Fun sports bar / food and drinks and people watching with plenty of outdoor seating.  Tons of unique drinks, tasty tacos and TV's to watch sports, and it's right next to the main old town area with the Giants stadium."}
{"text":"The only reason someone could rate this less than a 4 star would not be for the food. I have been going to Salty Senorita for many of  years and I rank there food between 4 & 5 stars. We went there last night (4/21) and had great food and great service. Our waiter, Jett Myers was as good as you can get. Now you ask why only 4 stars? The noise is very very loud. They should consider putting up some sound buffers on the walls and ceiling.  PS: they have a pretty good happy hour also."}
{"text":"First time trying the Salty Senorita after driving past it forever. Definitely was not disappointed. We sat outside and enjoyed the patio and music. The food was on point and the service was consistent throughout. Had the Machaca Crisp to share and a Fajita Bowl. Both were delicious and would order the same things again if nothing else. Thankfully their menu has many options and were looking forward to trying them all!"}
{"text":"Decent food and drinks, it's all about the environment really.  This place butts up next to Peoria sports complex which is awesome for games and events like July 4th.  Their Cinco de Mayo celebration is awesome!  They have a sand volleyball court, cornhole, firepits, dj's on the weekend.  Bathroom situations suck and my car got broken into once that's why it gets three stars lol, otherwise it's a cool casual place to chill on the west side with family and friends"}
{"text":"Disappointed, I used to come here a couple years ago it was fun. They had a good selection in their menu, food was great and an amazing margarita menu. Their menus are now only one page front and back, food is mediocre, they did away with the margarita menu, and to top it off they don't serve draft beer (who doesn't serve draft beer?!). Will not come back again. Only thing positive was service was good."}
{"text":"Came to Salty Senorita on a Monday around 7:00 and the outside area was super packed. We chose to sit inside so we could watch the games. Our waitress was pretty good not the quickest in getting us our drinks. We actually had to go and get our last one on our own. The best part about our experience was another Waitress named Leila. She was super personable and so nice checking on us even though she wasn't our waitress. She even apologized when we said we had to go get our own drink. We for sure were skeptical on coming back however, with Leila's hospitality and friendliness we for sure will be back and make sure to request her!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner at this restaurant last night for the first time. When you walk in the atmosphere is actually really cool. The place was pretty empty so when we were told to have a seat anywhere we chose we had a lot of options. After sitting down we watched multiple servers walk by and not one person acknowledged us. After about 10 minutes a waitress came up to us and asked if we wanted anything to drink. I asked her what \"Maria's choice\" margarita was and she didn't have any idea what kind of tequila was in it. After I got my margarita I asked her again what kind of tequila was in it and she responded with \"something with a c\". And to top it off the margarita was terrible. I got 3 tacos which weren't bad but they weren't good to say the least. My date got the steak fajitas which came with beans, rice, shredded cheese, guacamole, homemade tortillas and sour cream. It had obviously been sitting out for a while because the cheese was hard, not just a couple pieces, the entire bowl. And the rice was overlooked/burnt. The steak was burnt, tough and so chewy. Our server was nowhere to be found. I had to flag down a different waitress to talk to her about the cheese and rice. She was very kind and understanding. Eventually our server came out from hiding to check on us. Our waters remained empty almost the entire time we were there. She dropped off the check and came by to check for the money multiple times. All of a sudden she wanted to give us service. Eventually she asked us to pay so she could go home.. Luckily I had good company because overall the experience at this restaurant was terrible.   At least the homemade tortillas were tasty."}
{"text":"The waitress spilled a drink on our table but the food was good.   Tacos are plentiful, beers were flowing and the porch is excellent."}
{"text":"Service was great, but when we went to order food at 9:30 pm on a Saturday night the kitchen was closed! WTH! How do you expect to stay in business when your cooks don't care and management doesn't give crap either . Server was very apologetic I feel bad for her working with a bunch of careless morons."}
{"text":"We were there on a Saturday because R N R across the street was packed and had an hour wait; we should have waited.   When we asked about specials we were told they don't offer any during spring training because they don't have too.   The place was dead, drinks were overpriced and water downed.  Food was decent.  Our waitress looked like she just got off work at a strip bar.  No reason to go back."}
{"text":"The only thing that saved this horrid place from 1 star was the manager.  We tried this Saturday night with a  Groupon...nothing else would have motivated me to come here.  10 minutes to get a drink order.  Menus came out that didnt remotely match the website-they were the Spring Training menus (in October) due to their having an event...which I surmise was a lousy band outside.  Manager said he would try to make anything on the online menu happen-but no menu to provide so there we were looking on our phone to order.  Ordered the Steak avocado salad and a fajita burrito.  Tried to get th efamous fundido...sold out at 8pm.  We waited while my wife had a sugary mango margarita with a thimble of booze for a mere 8 bucks and I got a bottled SOL for $4.50 because evidently none of the tap beer worked.  Dinner came-Salad was basically a bowl of raw chopped white onions, burrito steak and hardly any greens.  My wifes fajita burrito was wet and basically full of rice for $13 with a cup of crusty refried beans.  The manager stpped in to check frequently and I felt bad for him as he was dealing with a complaint at every table surrounding us.  Even the Groupon couldnt save this place.  2 stars based on management effort...otherwise this was really a 1 star joint.  I think they are there to provide booze before a Padres/Mariners game in the spring."}
{"text":"The bartender did not seem to like his job. Told us the \"truth\" about the drinks and not to get the dollar shots when you'd think he would try to sell it to us anyway lol. He just seemed stressed. Not to mention the hour wait due to our bills and orders being mixed up. Tacos weren't great. Ahhhhhh but I did enjoy my margarita. Will I be back? To be continued....."}
{"text":"Well...sitting here with my man and we are NOT impressed. The decor is nice on the inside...but the service is non existent!! The beer selection is awful and their drafts aren't even working! One of the guys behind the bar seemed annoyed at us when we asked about the beer and the selection and did not even   really sound enthusiastic to be working. We are sitting outside and see at least THREE servers. None have come up to its and asked us for anything. Honestly the fastest server was my boyfriend who had to go up to the bar for some ice water!!! Really?!?! C'mon.   Not to mention the parking lot isn't lit up and the front doesn't have a light on the outside. It looked closed and kinda scary. I wouldn't come through that door alone. I'm only here for a friend's birthday. If it weren't for him I would never step foot in this place  Oh...just to add..went to the bathroom. There is someone trying to sell knic knacks! I couldn't find the soap cause there was women's products all over the counter. And this picture on the wall"}
{"text":"Love the transformation Salty Senorita made.  The old location reminded me of a shotty college joint, to go and get hammered and act like an idiot.  The new location matches the vibe of the rest of Old Town and has much better food and drinks.  As mentioned, it is much more refined, even with prices, but I am happy to pay a little more as the location and food are much, much nicer.    BTW - I got the orange/vanilla margarita, it was amazing.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, I love the concept of this place!  I've hosted 2 reunion events here in the past few years, met with friends and attended birthday parties, all  fun! Last night I chose Saltys for my monthly \"Fourth Friday Dinner\" that I host each month with our friends. Nine of us enjoyed the atmosphere, liked our friendly waitress and thought our food was pretty tasty...when we finally got it. Ordered drinks and appetizers as soon as we arrived at 6:50 pm. Very quiet, not many people there, sat on the patio. One of our party members apps arrived but it was 30+ mins later when the rest did and that was after asking about it, several times. Then another 40+ mins for 2 salads and a burrito after ordering, it was 9:00 when we finally had to ask for our check, and 40 mins later for them to bring the check. We're a pretty laid back group, but almost 3 hours of having to worry about getting our food and our bill wasn't acceptable. Yes, we were comped a few items, thank you for that... But I would have rather had better service and paid for what we ate. Our waitress was great but she is the representative of all other staff though, and they definitely did NOT support her last night!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and had great service once. Food here is bland and servers more interested talking to each other than their tables. There are by far better Mexican places in the area, like taco bell! I suggest trying that."}
{"text":"Chips were cold, salsa below average. And the chicken enchiladas weren't very good. Service was good. So many good Mexican restaurants around here and this place is not among them."}
{"text":"I have to give it 5 stars because of the quality of the drinks, tasty food and the personable service of our fun waitress Annalea. We stopped in on a whim and had great service and thoroughly enjoyed the Carne Asada and Short Rib Tacos. We'll go back for a later in the day adventure."}
{"text":"Well, tacos were very good and the sides were....just fair.  Patio is nice and drinks are fun.  Not sure if I would go back because there are SO many fun places but its fine for a lovely day to sit and enjoy the sun.  We had good service and lots of refills of chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"The girls are friendly and suggestive and it's always amazing vibes when I go! Their new menus and food items  such as the taco plates or fajita sandwich is absolutely to die for. I enjoyed our night out."}
{"text":"It's hard not to love this place.  Great location, great food, and ARGUABLY the WORST service in town! Enjoy it, have fun while your there, and when the next great place comes along, salty will  either fire their management and HR department, or there will be a new place there.  Pretty sad."}
{"text":"Perfect food portions, fantastic salsa (which seems to be different at most establishments), and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Not my first choice due to service but the food is decent! I love the bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary bar on Saturdays and sundays! I like it for a good brunch that's not too crowded and when I want to skip the bar feel at RnR. I don't typically go for their brunch food bc they're lunch and dinner is better! Good prices for what they have."}
{"text":"We went there after Spring Training and were expecting a crowd.  Surprisingly we got seated right away, but that was the end of our good experience.  They have a spring training menu, which was fine, but very limited descriptions on most of the drinks and food.  Then we waited for over 20 minutes (menus and all) and no one ever came to so much as give us water, take our drink order, etc.  The waitresses wouldn't make eye contact, so who knows who our server even was.  We gave up and walked out after the table that was sat after us got their drinks.  I doubt they noticed or cared.  We landed at another Mexican food place down the road, just as busy, but with much better service! Plenty of food options in that area, so I will continue taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We HAD to visit Old Town on our visit to Scottsdale, it looked so cute and a friend recommended it.  My husband had never experienced Southwestern culture before, so I was excited to explore with him.  We had discussed looking for a Mexican restaurant in Old Town where we could enjoy a margarita.  We saw the Salty Senorita from across the street, it looked cute and fun.  The bar and restaurant are creatively decorated, very bright and festive.  We were warmly greeted at the bar by a friendly young male bartender.  He even made the attempt to remember our names.  We happily learned that we had arrived during happy hour and there were $4 margaritas available!  Bonus!  Our drinks were quite tasty and just the right strength.  We had a late lunch at another establishment, so we didn't get a chance to try the food.  I love the name of this place, very creative!"}
{"text":"We went here on national margarita day....their blender was broken and they were unable to make frozen drinks. Huge disappointment.  Service,again, huge disappointment. It must be a miserable place to work because I did not see a smile from any employee, especially our waitress. Food....plain awful. The one thing this place has going for it is the outdoor patio. But even that is in disrepair. Their is nothing about this place that suggests that the owners or the employees care. Bottom line-we paid too much money for bad food and bad service just to sit outside. I guess we forgot it's Phoenix where there are many Mexican restaurants with outdoor patios."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Food was another story. Got a variety of the tacos and the street corn. Maybe it is because I am from California but I wasn't too amused. The meat was dry and the seafood was bland.   By no measure are we margarita experts but was a little watered down.   Enjoyed the service. Attentive and checked on us a perfect amount."}
{"text":"Food was decent, decor was nice but the crowd and staff were odd. There were children sprawled out sleeping in random places, a dog sitting inside, and a few odd looking patrons. The bar tender had absolutely no personality and was semi-unfriendly. He was quick and efficient at getting drinks out. The drinks tasted watered down and lacked originality. The menu was lack luster. Definitely not a horrible place but I wouldn't visit ag"}
{"text":"Food is usually subpar, and I don't think I've ever had prompt service here. I mean, it's a bar, so I don't expect much. But when your first round is finished by the time the waitress brings out the chips and salsa you ordered with it... Well.   Side note: Salty's is a horrible neighbor. So many late night noise complaints from the music (sometimes on weeknights). But who am I kidding, who doesn't love dubstep at midnight on a Thursday?"}
{"text":"Great food, appetizers, drinks and outdoor seating.  If you are hitting up a Spring Training game at Scottsdale Stadium, this is a great starting point, but expect slow service on the weekends."}
{"text":"Great place for a lunch! The staff is very friendly and attentive. They made a custom order for me and it was no problems for them. Their shredded beef was excellent!"}
{"text":"Awesome place on Tuesdays... Great, cheap street tacos and a beach cruiser bicycle giveaway. Check it out."}
{"text":"Highly recommend a casual lunch here. The highlights for me were anything with the black beans, they are so flavorful and filling. Burritos, tacos, rice and beans were all outstanding. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"This place sucks really bad. Bad service not very clean just very unimpressed. Food really bad this place is not kept up at all weeds everywhere tables are a mess."}
{"text":"No, just no. I'm upset and feeling all things not great about this new place. Location is fine and patio is great as always but that is where it ends. The food is meh and why did you change the menu? If business is going well and people love you, why change it?! Change is definitely not always good. I thought you were just upgrading location. That new menu of yours is terrible, there's barely anything on it worth ordering. We ordered the happy hour nachos, there was a puddle of water at the bottom of the plate, maybe from watery salsa? who knows but it was weird and they only tasted okay. How can it be that your only quesadilla on the menu is veggie? Why are your tacos made in child size and cost $3 each? Why, why why oh why ever change?!  Please, do us all a favor and have re-re-opening party with the old menu back and celebrating all of the good old cheap awesome Mexican food and margaritas that we all loved. I used to go here at least every other week if not more for happy hour, now it's very unlikely saltys will come to mind when we are choosing where to go."}
{"text":"I love coming here for margaritas! The atmosphere screams, relax and have a great time. You can never go wrong with taco Tuesday either. They have a great menu, my go to drink is the fish bowl because it's so worth it. It's a great place for groups to have fun as well."}
{"text":"Good tacos, a little overpriced but the service is spotty! It's hit and miss if you will get good service. Waiting 20 minutes at our table for them to come over is unacceptable"}
{"text":"They took the life right out of it! (Please refer to my review from the OLD Salty Senorita).   First of all, what was the BEST thing about Salty S? The happy hour. We could go, get tanked on buckets, and have $5 wings or tacos. The wings, GONE completely. The TACOS? Trendy, tiny and expensive. The drinks? Mucho dinero. They were missing the tamales and tortas from the menu \"we don't have them\". So my friends and I, and there are a lot of us some Fridays, we all ordered the new \"Barrio Queen cheap copy\" tacos. And burritos.   I feel like I buried a friend. And to top it off, my beloved got food poisoning and about lost the chicken burrito on the way home. Time for a new happy hour, friends!  Oh, and my normally $35 bill was $80. Yikes!"}
{"text":"We came in for Cinco de Mayo and had fantastic service from Miranda M. She was great with suggestions and quick with service. The food was great as well.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday and it was pretty dead. The waitresses were too busy talking so the service was pretty bad. The mimosas were mostly orange juice with a ton of pulp, barely any champagne in them. Tacos were pretty good but al a carte. Miss the old menu they used to have at the other location."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! After previously going to salty Senoritas in Scottsdale and loving it. My friend and I came to the Peoria one hungry and thirsty. We were greeted at the door by a friendly manager who sat is right away. HOWEVER, after waiting for a waitress to come over for 20 minutes my friend went and notified we were still waiting. Server finally comes over and says \"I guess I am waiting on you guys\" gives us menus and leaves. 15 minutes then goes by and we are still sitting there waiting. Waitress never comes back as we watch her chatting with her coworkers about 30 feet away not even acknowledging we are there. After 35 minutes no service we decide to leave. Waitress WATCHES us leave and turns her head. As we are leaving the manager sees us and says \"why are we leaving so soon\" in which I stated we were not being served. All he had to say was that he was sorry and embarrassed! Did not offer anything to help the situation! Just let us leave! WOW!!"}
{"text":"We came here a few years ago and had a wonderful time so decided to come back. Of course the table next to us had ordered Irish Car Bombs and enjoyed them so much I went over and asked them what was in them bc I do not like beer but when they said Baileys I decided to try them. It's been a fun drink ever since.  But that table wasn't here today.  Our service was very slow. 45 minutes for 2 tacos and a burger (which was on special today).  She suggested the homemade guacamole but did not warn me was $10 so I canceled it but she made me feel guilty. I had two house margaritas and she obviously thought I should have ordered the top one for $10. Good food but slow from the kitchen."}
{"text":"Were told to take table at the end of the patio. No one came to ask about drinks or anything until I came to front 10 min later and asked if anyone would serve us.  It serves Mexican food but there is no complimentary chips. Overall wait time was more than 45 minutes. Really? For chicken fajitas and tortilla soup?! And they were not busy. The size of the portions not adequate for the price. You are paying for being in the heart of Scottsdale.   And the morale is - don't forget to read Yelp before going anywhere. Everything people said before about the business appeared right!"}
{"text":"A perfect location in the heart of downtown Scottsdale and a large patio for people watching. The food was not great. I ordered a burrito for lunch. It came 30 minutes later cold and the cheese was not even melted. Service was slow, bathrooms were unkempt, and the food make this a 2 star"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Have tried to come here multiple times and the service is just worse every time. Just awful. I feel like I'm putting the servers out by being there. Done. Never again"}
{"text":"Hey, I loved the breakfast bowl I got here. I think all the breakfast bowls here are really good. Other than that though, the service is just extremely slow."}
{"text":"\"I will read Yelp reviews before every dining experience, I will read....\" Made a last minute decision to stop in for a drink and a bite before a show at the Arizona Broadway Theatre next door.  Bad call.  Place was dirty--had to ask for a table wipe after we sat down.  Ordered \"table side guac\" which arrived already made up. Okay.   Salsa was grainy and more interesting and flavorful than most runny tomato salsas, so saved the zero star rating.  Tortilla chips were stale.  Margaritas were meh:  mine was frozen;  wife's on the rocks--have had many better.    We split a chile rellanos dinner--not being a Mexican fan I thought it was tasteless, but my wife liked it.  Learned my lesson:  don't ever even think about eating without studying Yelp first!"}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend who came down from Prescott for the day and we just wanted sit in a nice comfortable place and have some cold drinks and apps while shooting the breeze.  A friend had suggested SS.  Upon arriving at about 5pm on Friday (7/11/14) we found a pleasant and nicely set up restaurant/bar.  Perfect, right?  Meh, not so much...  We ordered iced tea.  The tea arrives and looks nearly clear.  We comment to Kristen that the tea doesn't appear to actually be tea and she said she would bring us tea from a fresh brew.  She returned a few minutes later with the same water looking drinks.  We tried to explain to her that this didn't look nor taste like tea.  Kristen said she would tell management...  if you have to tell management that the tea isn't tea the management will surely not be capable of fixing this problem.  It's AZ for crying out loud...  Tea is about the most popular beverage in the state.  We pressed on.  We ordered table side guacamole, fundido, and salsa.  All three were somebody's idea of making more AZ staples in new fun way.  Wrong again.  Pretty bad attempts.  We're sitting there, trying to talk and at least enjoy each others company seeing as that would be the only thing we were going to get out of this outing.  And here comes the 22 year old \"shooter\" girls...  There is less than 20 people in the establishment and we're two 50 year olds having tea and chips and they interrupt our convo saying \"hey, let's get wild and crazy\" or some such attempt at pushing their wares.  I'm sure this is probably a fine establishment to go watch a game and drink margs or beers, but that would be its maximum capability."}
{"text":"This bar embodies everything Glendale truly is, which is more of a slight than anything else. Every time I some how end up at this place I always get the same experience. A mediocre night of waiting for drinks, watching people who I vaguely remember from high school, and waiting to find out where the party is afterwards. That last part should really be the point of interest for this bar since after-parties seem like a fairly common thing to do after visiting Salty's. Either way, I really wish my friends wouldn't want to come to this bar as often as they do."}
{"text":"The two blonde sisters are the best workers they have. Very quick to get out orders and always kept a conversation going. Would only go there for them"}
{"text":"Definitely amazing Mexican food. Some of the best I have ever had. Good service too....sit at the bar outside."}
{"text":"This was a great visit. Nice bar menu, nice staff, indoor/outdoor seating. Love the taco variety. Thank you for a nice afternoon! Thanks Nick :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here twice. I have gotten food poisoning BOTH times. Service is always terrible. Servers don't know the menu nor know how to wait tables in a timely fashion. We were told that a bucket of beers was $10. We got the bill and we were charged for EACH individual beer in the bucket. Server claimed it was OUR fault for ordering different beers in the bucket. Shouldn't you tell your customers that it was $10 for a bucket of coronas ONLY and different beers would be an additional charge? What a concept. She wouldn't take the bucket off our bill. We paid, no tip left and will never be returning nor recommending - as many people who have written previous reviews have stated. There's a new taco place down the street that puts this place to shame."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone was so excited that the 'new' Salty opened up. It's the same as before, but the décor changed.  The patio is great, you have to admit.  This is a great after spring training spot, but for me that is about it.  The drinks are overpriced and not that great and the food is mediocre.  The cheapest thing on the menu are the  tacos and they are the size of my palm.  It's a bit overpriced for 'fast food', which is what it's equivalent to.    however  they are located in a great spot and have a fantastic patio, that's why you go, as do I."}
{"text":"Payton was the best waitress I have had at a restaurant in years. She was friendly and gave exceptional service. I would be back to see just her."}
{"text":"Salty's has a party reputation.  I had not ever heard a word about their food so I was nervous to give them a try, even with my Groupon...  They were good, really good!  We tried the nachos with chicken and had chipotle burritos.  The nachos filled us completely and we actually boxed and took our burritos home.  The Main Man ate his burro later in the day and thought it was tasty, he had no complaints even with the reheating.  I ate mine the next day and thought it was absolutely yummy!  So yummy that I wished for another one to eat the next day, and the next day...  Thank you to Groupon for giving us a reason and opportunity to try Salty's and thank you to Salty's for being a solidly tasty choice.  We don't go over by the mall often but when we do, Salty's will be a food stop!"}
{"text":"Eh. My food was not super flavorful and the guacamole was bland. I had the veggie tacos and they were ok. If you are on a health kick these will do you well as they are on lettuce and not in a tortilla. They had some flavor but not a ton. The salsa was not great - not hot and it's not a flavor I like (you might love it if you like fire roasted veggies) but I prefer hot and spicy and it was not so awesome. The rice was very good and my friends steak fajitas were really good with lots of accompaniments that had him digging in. Because his was really good, I'm giving middle of the road rating and advising you to get a meat entree as it definitely seemed to be better than the more bland veggie option."}
{"text":"Don't bother with the too loud and rude staff across the street at RnR and instead try out the Salty Senorita.  Great staff - especially Perla - and terrific margaritas.  Visited with my son and we loved the entire experience.  Salty's will be our first stop next time we are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place!!! Amazing drinks and appetizers! I love the open atmosphere and the misters make it the perfect place on a hot day!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Started with giving our table away to wrong ppl, incorrect drink orders, incorrect food, late food, terribly mixed margaritas. The list goes on."}
{"text":"Although the weather was a little warm, I was happy with the Taco Tuesday experience at Salty. There weren't a lot of customers and it was a little dark outside, but our server was attentive and friendly. She had good recommendations and responded pretty quickly to our somewhat frequent demands.   My friends ordered a frozen drink sampler that they enjoyed. The cheese dip was delicious. I ordered the La Paloma drink which wasn't too strong so I was happy with that. My boyfriend ordered the Carne Asada tacos and I ordered the Chicken Tinga tacos. All the food was great, despite them having a large party that ate up some of the items that my friend wanted to order.  They also did a bike raffle which I thought was a fun little touch. Overall, a relaxing experience and good quality food and service!"}
{"text":"Summer our hostess was do friendly and got us a table immediate.  Thank you for the smiles.  I can tell your love job"}
{"text":"The decor and vibe are way classier than the Peoria location, however the service is a bit lacking. It's large, clean, and has indoor and outdoor seating, but it definitely is suited for the Old Town Scottsdale crowd. Their menu is pricier and more upscale than the Peoria location, as well."}
{"text":"Good food and nice atmosphere. The hostesses were on a power trip and wouldn't let us sit in the sun, but let the next group (same size group). Tainted the whole experience. I'd try it again another time."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! Tess was awesome and really stepped up. Definitely will be returning next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Salty is the proper name of this place.  People are extremely trashy.  Seriously they let all the crazies and dirty people in.  Not worth it..."}
{"text":"The service was awesome, food was great, and management is just great!! Ashley Parrish was our server and the bartender Eric were pleasing and my friend and I will def be back!!"}
{"text":"I'm going big here since I am grateful to have a cool place to hang out on the west side.  i dont need to cross the whole city now to get to Scottsdale and worry about my DD getting drunk and having to pay $60 for a cab ride home, not to mention going to pick up your vehicle the next day doesn't require $20 in fuel either.  I like this place, plenty of misters, girls are hot, service is decent, food is decent, margaritas are huge, and the place is always packed.  I know us west siders can be trashy compared to the snobby east siders but we need a place to hang too and if you dont like it....why are you even here?"}
{"text":"It was just ok, nothing special really. Service was slow and didn't seem to care, just dropped the food and moved on."}
{"text":"Salty Seniorita is an old town institution. I have spent many spring training afternoons and mornings at Salty's. It has been a favorite of my friends and family and we've developed an affinity for their friendly service, good drinks and great food. However, over the last few years, the service and attention to detail has deteriorated to an extent that I won't be taking my business here any longer. With so many new options in old town that actually provide some level of competent service (including RnR across the street), it doesn't even make sense.   Yesterday, my party and I were seated after a 15 minute wait (not bad for a spring training afternoon) but the service was just terrible on so many levels. We started with two orders of the bacon guacamole which the waiter said would \"be right out\"'after a 20 minute wait. They turned out to take 20 more minutes. When we finally placed our food orders and 45 minutes had passed, the waiter came to ask us how we'd like to split the check BEFORE we even had the food on our table. Truly egregious. We had an outdoor table and it was kind of ironic to look across the street and wonder how much better the meal would have been at RnR. Again, the waiter and restaurant had clearly failed any measurable service standard and instead of trying to make amends, he simply tried to accelerate shuffling us out of the restaurant. Unacceptable way to treat long time customers.   The food did eventually show up and as always, the tacos did impress. Salty's still does a great job with the food. So my advice: if you want great Mexican food with terrible service, Salty's is your spot. But if you want decent food with some actual service--there's 30 other options in old town alone. Bring back the old Salty's atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Salty Senorita is a bar with an interesting patio, which happens to serve some limited Mexican items.  The service is mediochre, and the food is as well.   We ordered drinks and saw them sitting at the bar for about 5 minutes before the waitress showed up from being AWOL and deliverred them.  The menu is pretty limited - tacos several different ways, with burritos and bowls and a few appetizers.  We started with chips and salsa, then ordered the guacamole, which was pretty good and the highlight of the evening.  That followed by a couple different tacos and a burrito bowl.  The tacos were OK, and the bowl was way too salty.  Almost inedible.  I guess if you're drinking heavily, you wouldn't notice.  Go for the patio and the beer.  That's about it."}
{"text":"Still a fan of the food but had a bad experience today. Went for happy hour and was 6 minutes early. Happy hour is from 3-7 pm but don't go even a few minutes early and expect to get a margarita at happy hour price. Our waitress did not let us know that she was charging us full price when we ordered and when the drinks were delivered and I asked if it was a happy hour margarita and I was told no, the system does not change until 3pm. It would have been nice and good customer service if we were told that if we ordered six minutes later the drinks would have been a lot less. We could have very easy asked for menus and water before we ordered the drinks but did not think it was going to be an issue. We have been to plenty of other restaurants that will honor happy hour prices a few minutes early or at least tell you that it starts in a few minutes before talking a drink order. We also ordered \"table side\" guacamole that we have ordered many times before that was made table side. Today it was brought over all ready prepared. Still as good but not the usual presentation that is expected when the menu states \"prepared table side\" Guess I just went on a bad day. Still like this place but will be more careful and ask more questions the next time."}
{"text":"Place is solid, good specials for the area, good food, good service. I enjoy coming here. Word to the wise, it gets hot during day and it's not an indoor type of place."}
{"text":"Such a shame.  The old Salty was SO much better.  With the move also came a menu that is not as good, bad service, they've lost the fun/quirky decor, and the food isn't near as good.  Our server Sonya did a great job but she was clearly running herself crazy because there wasn't enough staff.  Drinks were ordered that had to be re-ordered because they never appeared.  People brought food out from the kitchen dish by dish and by the time I got my salad, others at our table had already finished.  One order was wrong but he kept it because who knows how long it would be until the right thing came??  Would've said something to a manager if we could have found one anywhere.  Going back?? Nah.  This was the 3rd time for the new place which is 2 more than it deserved."}
{"text":"Got seated right away for a party of 3. After 10 minutes of no acknowledgement we found a waitress to find our waitress. Tableside guacamole is not tableside. It was good though. Fajitas were great except for trying to figure out how to build and eat one on a street taco size. When I asked for a regular sized tortilla I was told \"I don't think we do that. I just push a button and that's what comes out.\" If it's a vending machine that makes the food, I need one for my house."}
{"text":"This place isn't that bad. Actually, it's fine.  I can't remember exactly what the old location was like, and although the upgrade is much nicer aesthetically, there's something about the \"feel\" of it that's similar (especially to how it fits in Old Town). Salty has more of a straight restaurant vibe to it (not the type of place your gonna hang out at REAL late), but it has a bit of a \"hipper\" feel to it now so there's no need to rush off to other places after you're done eating. You can stay for a few more drinks.  That being said, I came here with a group of friends on a Saturday (late) morning when we were waiting for a table across the street at RnR since we needed SOMETHING in our systems stat and this place was empty.   The patio is nice. The bartender was nice. my mimosa (served in a margarita glass) was just fine. I even ordered a steak taco because I needed to eat something before the extremely long wait for breakfast across the street, and it was fine.   It was hard to get a real feel for the new Salty Senorita when it was empty on a Saturday morning, but after checking it out I'd be inclined to stop in again (maybe for HH). However, it's still not a place that would immediately stand out when I was thinking of a bar and/or restaurant to hang out at in Old Town."}
{"text":"I would consider the food to be very good, however not authentic Mexican food if that's what you're looking for. The staff were very reluctant. My boyfriend ordered a michelada and the waitress asked me if I wanted one as well and what type of beer I wanted in mine, I'm 7 months pregnant and not even the age to legally drink. She didn't card my boyfriend at all which was surprising. The food came out fast and the portions were a good size, even though their menu was really small. At the end we paid cash and the waitress gave us less change back. I would come back for the food, but because of the customer service due to the waitress I would not come back, you could easily find another subpar Mexican restaurant elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great time at other people that just want to have fun and flirt and drink this is the place for you the drinks are great the food is good and the waitresses are superb if you're ordering a margarita ask for the real thing and make it a double if you're ordering food anything with shredded beef is absolutely amazing the rice and beans are a must it is a huge place that is meant for social gatherings if you're having a birthday party or engagement party this is the place to go they have enough space and enough fun activities were exceptionally great it's the best summertime place ever Sand Volleyball courts and all of the rest of the amenities the waitresses and staff are absolutely amazing"}
{"text":"It is an ok restaurant and bar. Since I was traveling alone I sat at the bar. Service was not that great but the food was good. One thing was that they ran out some stuff so I had limited choices (Whole two sections were gone)"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss, as a fun place to go with friends its great, the drinks are cheap, theres a good atmosphere, theres random things to do like volleyball, dance, flirt with some cute ladies.   As far as food goes its hit or miss, somethings I've had were really good, somethings I wish I had thrown in the trash or sent back... wait I did throw it in the trash but I should have sent it back."}
{"text":"Best tacos and margaritas in the area.  I hate downloading apps to my phone and I downloaded the Yelp app just to write this review. I love this place. I feel like I can sit in here and eat tacos all day."}
{"text":"Took like 20 mins to get a beer when there was like a total of 3 people sitting at the bar and maybe 7-9 tables. It's was not busy and had plenty of staff on hand. I watched the bartender stand around and clean cuz the order never even came in. Pretty sure my server forgot and a spark went off when I kept eyeing her every time she passed.  Tacos were pretty bland and dry. Was kinda annoyed I paid $3 for one ear of corn but actually was really good and totally worth it. The drink menu looked good too.  Overall I'd never eat here again, however id probably come by for happy hour or something like that. Never for a meal, not that type of place in my opinion."}
{"text":"How do you spell bad! S-A-L-T-Y    S-E-N-O-R-I-T-A!  Boy talk about blowing a great location!  These guys need to get a good executive chef to get that menu and kitchen under control!  I ordered a Margarita. So-so at best. Then a Tamale that was suppose to have sweet corn...boy that wasn't sweet corn, that was a lump of something floury and yuckie. Your masa sucks guys!   The pork on top was just oaky too.   The service was a bit slow.  What's up with those retro white glittery seats, you guys get a special price on them since they were sitting in a warehouse for 50 years!!!!  But these guys will draw a crowd just because of where they are, proving that location does matter. Imagine if they could manage a good menu and control that kitchen.  BTW the service wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"Save your money and skip Salty's... This place went downhill with the new spot. Customers service was a joke, to-go food was lousy to say the least (chicken fajitas undercooked, dried-hard rice.. and flour tortillas when the menu reads CORN tortillas) I finally had to flag down a server and ask her to check on my food. The bartenders where too busy flirting with the staff to offer another beer while I waited or update me on the food.  There are plenty of spots in Old Town... I doubt I'll be back"}
{"text":"Boooooooooo!  Chairs were falling apart. No beer on draft.  No ginger ale (yes. NO ginger ale..... at a bar... that serves mixed drinks... no ginger ale)   They have a sand volleyball court but get this..... nothing to air up the volleyballs with!  I mean.. i just cant. So many fails. I cant believe we wasted a babysitter on this :/"}
{"text":"I'm giving them 1 star....well, because, I have to. However they do deserve the 1 star because of the location. Arrowhead is such a built up booming place, and I have always gone to the original Scottsdale location and Arrowhead is SO much bigger! With so many outdoor fun games for kids and adults. When we walked in we were all discussing how this was DEFINITELY going to be our new spot since I just moved the the BEST SIDE aka the WEST SIDE and we could use a fun place for us girls to spend Sunday Funday.  PFFFFTTTTTT well thats not happening! Unless all we want to partake in is their game activities and our own bottled water. Service? Hello? We were there on a quiet evening. Probably 3 other tables of patrons were there. It took about 20 minutes to get our adult beverages.  Our complimentary chips and salsa: stale saltless chips and a tiny plastic container of salsa. Maybe times have changed but I dont recall Scottsdale location being so stingy with the salsa. Thats ok though, because the chips sucked so bad we didnt even finish the salsa. Thats their game plan i guess? I ordered the cheese fondue (that took 30 minutes to come out.) although the plate it came out in was burning hot, the cheese was not. Trying to get refills of drinks (water and margaritas) was difficult. Our waitress was nice to us but SO inattentive.  Our meals (Salads!) still had not come out 50 minutes after ordering. NO exaggeration.   Finally we had to ask for a manager, which I hate to do. He came out (with the salads, which he tried to deliver to another table first, and both salads didnt have dressing with them) We complained about the stale chips and the fondue. He was fumbling over his words but apologetic, and his eyes were very glassy and pink. Hey...maybe Im being judgmental but I'm putting together a theory here.  he replaced the chips with a new batch of stale chips. And brought out a new warm fondue. And salad dressing. He apologized again and gave us a few \"Free Appetizer\" cards (which I will not use at that location!) and gave us a credit on our bill.  You would think asking for the manager would make our waitress a LITTLE TINY more attentive? Nahhhhh why bother with us now? LOL  After that it took some time to flag her down for our check so we could leave and get beverages somewhere else.  It would take new management and staff for us to attempt to give that location another try. Why bother though with so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"Horrible service at the bar. Super slow. Only 1 computer / credit card machine for 8+ bartenders. But the servers are idiots - lazy, inattentive, slow, and do things like CARRY CUSTOMER's CREDIT CARDS AROUND IN THEIR MOUTHS, and STICK THEIR FINGERS *inside* the shot glasses after they've poured a shot when they're carrying three shot glasses at once!!  No draft beer yet.  OUTRAGEOUS HAPPY HOUR PRICING.  No smoking on the patio, unlike the old location."}
{"text":"$18 for a 6er of tacos. Nonexistent service. GTFO. Run. Save your money for the stadium (I'm assuming you'd only come here because you're going to a spring training game; who would actually live this far from civilization?). Also, bring your flat brim Monster hat to help with the overwhelmingly East County (CA) vibe....."}
{"text":"So, nice evening and nice location to relax.   That said, service was only kinda slow but the food was good.  The band was ok.  It was surprisingly empty for a Friday evening but that was ok with me.  That said, I would go back but probably only if it is suggested by someone else."}
{"text":"This place is really beachy, mexican and cute. They have a large outside patio area to eat and they area is open for sitting inside. They have an inside /outside bar area and service is right on par. The salads are really wonderful with fresh nice quality lettuce and nice spring mix. The dressing seem homemade and delicious.  The tacos and enchiladas are outstanding. I like the seafood items and they are really nice and quality products."}
{"text":"Been living in Old town since March 1 2015. Being 25 I love to go out for dinner and drinks but in old town it's not easy as the entire city of Phoenix flocks there.   My recommendation, go to Salty's and see my man Jeramy. This guys attention to his customer base is impeccable. Working the bar like a champ but won't neglect you for a minute. I feel guilty because if he serviced me anymore than he already does I think I'd be cheating on my girlfriends."}
{"text":"Eh. Stopped in before a Spring Training game and had a very lackluster experience. The coolest part about Salty's is the entire set up. There is plenty of outdoor patio seating with a lot of open space. Additionally, there is a playground area for kids to play and a game area that includes Jenga and other fun games. Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff begins to fade. Drink specials were decent but nothing to rave about. The food was overpriced and lacked flavor unfortunately. The worst part however was the service. It took us almost half an hour to get our food orders and just as long to put in additional drink orders and get our check. I understand that it was St. Patrick's day and it can get crowded, but we felt ignored by our waitress at times.   Standard drinks, flavorless food and meh service. Salty's won't be my go-to place for Happy Hour or Mexican food, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Great location to ride your bike to and enjoy  Sunday.  Unfortunately, the positive experience stops there.  Overwhelmed with the drinking crowd, the service was minimal, glasses were dirty and the food is not worth the effort."}
{"text":"i really do love salty, especially when its nice out, but damn i would not touch this location with a ten foot pole on the weekends. motocross bro-tards and affliction wearing thirty five year olds is not my idea of fun, not too mention waiting forever for drinks and being crammed into a high scool reuinion for all of the west valleys finest.   after a spring training game or on a weeknight this place is great. the food actually is really good and tijuanna tuesday ($1 tacos and $5 buckets of beer) is worth it for sure. volleyball, horseshoes and bags make it and essential day drinking spot when the weather permits.  ya the monastery was really cool, salty is just trying for a younger vibe. so as long as you avoid the god awful weekend nights then you are golden."}
{"text":"Looks a lot better than it is. While the food isn't horrible, it's overpriced for what you get (both quality and quantity) - if it wasn't so expensive, I'd give the food 3 stars, as it is, 2 stars. Had one specialty drink, the one they make at your table (their website is currently not working for their margarita list) and was extremely underwhelmed.   Service was good, but out of the numerous places my mother and I ate at this weekend in Scottsdale, this was by far our least favorite. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Been here a ton of times. Great outdoor atmosphere. I always try to get Kassandra to be our waitress, really friendly and attentive! All the girls are nice though. Love the chips and salsa even though you have to pay for it. People who complain about dust should never go to an outdoor bar in Arizona. Their area in back is huge with a sand volley ball court, horseshoe pit and fire pit and the girls do their best to try and cover it."}
{"text":"My friends and I had a few drinks here and we loved it. We liked the outside the only downside to this place was the parking it was hard to find a spot."}
{"text":"I didn't give it five stars because I didn't feel it was all that. There were a lot of tequila choices but most were for margaritas and not to drink straight. Our bartender, although new, also didn't seem as attentive to us as she was to a party of men. The nachos were a bit of a disappointment. I did love the flavor of the salsa though."}
{"text":"Went here in May 2014 after a ballgame. They had a special post-game menu that was very slimmed down--maybe 10 items, which was fine. They were packed.  My large group sat ourselves and got chairs for ourselves. The table was dirty. It took about 40 minutes for anyone to wipe it off, and that was after several requests.  It was a really hot day and we kept asking for drinks, or just waters, which we had to wait about an hour for. That's when our order was taken. Had to keep asking for someone to take our order. I counted 10 wait staff. They seemed really disorganized--running back with 1 thing in their hand and then coming right back with another 1 thing in their hand, then waiting on someone in a totally different section of the place. Lots of unnecessary time and energy spent walking! I used to wait tables in a really fast-paced environment and I think it could have been done with that generous staffing, but again it just seemed there was little organization. We'd ask someone to take our order and they didn't seem to know who was supposed to wait on us.  The food was really lousy. I had some sort of cheese enchilada. Greasy, soggy and gross.  The only reason I ate any of it was sheer hunger.  Their regular menu sounds really tasty. I am just so afraid to try it again due to cleanliness, service and those enchiladas.  The *place* is awesome. A good portion of it is outdoors with roofs to keep you in the shade. Volleyball pit, other games, fountains, upstairs balconies, and a view of the ballpark.  I mean it is a *really* cool place."}
{"text":"Where do I start. Sat down, got ignored. Waited 15 minutes and got our beers but a Stella was warmer than Rosie Odennels ass. Asked for a cooler beer and the bar manager said \"hey we're busy that's as cold as it gets\". So my brother asked for a manager.....short story later this horrific bag of hot dog sh@i of am organization finally sent out a manager to apologize for her bar manager who lacked any fucks to give and her piece or shut server who was so hungover she couldn't answer a simple question like \"how are you?\" She literally grunted when we asked her. Worst place on Scottsdale. If I could shut it down it down forever o would. I wouldn't stop in here to take an emergency shit."}
{"text":"The people who patronize this establishment are the kind of people that bring their babies and/or children to the bar on Friday night.   Just stop and think about that for a moment.  You have a baby.................. in a bar???  To add insult to injury, the Chupacabra margarita tastes like dirty, soapy ass. How dare they insult my precious X Files by naming this horrific drink after the mystical character that Fox and Dana chased after in one of my favorite episodes ever? Blasphemy.   Finally, I will close this review with the tweet I sent whilst using the ladies restroom (yes, I tweet and pee at the same time):  \"If you are ever looking for a dirty, sloppy, drunken lay then head to the womens restroom at salty senorita peoria\"   Oh, PS... Thanks to Andrew K I just realized I missed the most important text of the night:  \"I'm too drunk to be alive. Sincerely, in hell in Peoria\""}
{"text":"If your favorite part of the bar is a good patio, Salty Senoritas will be heaven for you! There were bonfires, volleyball courts, and countless tables. I was just one of hundreds of thirsty customers gawking at the UofA vs. ASU game.   This is the largest parking lot I've seen for any bar. Ever. It will be a journey actually getting to the door, and don't try any shenanigans as cops love to cruise around everywhere. Security is kind of pompous, but all bark and no bite. They should decide whether or not they feel like enforcing the unwritten dress code. Also, you can only shine your flashlight on a man's license so many times before you start to annoy us all.  You'll find that once you're inside the staff is rather efficient, making empty beer bottles disappear before you can even snap your fingers. Many youngsters hustling around keeping the place clean. Bartenders seem short-staffed, but still managed to serve me immediately, pouring middle-of-the-road tequilas like Cuervo with a heavy hand.   One drawback to Salty's is the identity crisis it faces as a nightlife spot. Being mostly outside, it doesn't have the acoustics or lighting to encourage lots of dancing. On the other hand, the competing sounds of televisions, DJs, and close-quarters seating destroys any shred of intimacy needed for a lounge vibe. Unlike the bars I go to exclusively for the dance floor, or the music, Salty Senorita's is enjoyable but I'm left without a particular reason to return."}
{"text":"I went here with my 2 girlfriends for dinner and drinks. After waiting 15 minutes to get service at our table we ordered food and 40 minutes later waitress comes to ask us what we would like to eat. We tell her we already ordered put food. She said oh yea let me check on it. We ordered a salad and nachos. The nachos looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp and burned and everything cold and sour cream looked like cottage cheese. After never being asked if we wanted a re fill on drinks we paid and left small tip due to bad food and bad service. 3 of us noticed on bank statement we were over charged from what we paid for tips. Do not go here unless you want waitresses to rip you off."}
{"text":"I want to start out with saying that I love the new and improved Salty Senorita and I love it. This was my 2nd time there since they relocated and it was a perfect Taco Tuesday night. I'm sorry to say that I don't remember our server's name but I will never forget her smile and excellent service. She was attentive, helpful, enthusiastic and knowledgeable about what she was talking about. I had the bacon guacamole woth chips for an appetizer and it was to die for. To top of the night, I had the Carne Asada Taco and the Chicken Tinga Taco and they were perfect. GREAT TACO TUESDAY!"}
{"text":"stopped by to beat the heat under the water showers they have on the patio. quick service, good beer selection, and happy hour. Our waitress was very attentive and there were no long waits. The food was REALLY GOOD. I got the crab flautas - I highly recommend them. lots of taco options and health choices such as the burrito bowl. the food was so good I unfortunately did not get to capture a photo"}
{"text":"The food was terrible, service was very slow, and the drinks were ok. Fun concept but this place needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"We went to Salty Senorita's last night to celebrate a birthday with about 25 people.  I was skeptical to start with because I had been there before and my experience wasn't great.   At least they are consistent.  The only good thing going for Salty Senorita's is the outdoor environment.  The food and the service is some of the worst I have experienced.    I know \"Salty\" is in the name of the venue, but the amount of salt in the food is just ridiculous.  A friend of mine waited over an hour for a salad. We waited an hour for our carne asada tacos that were filled with steak bits that were burned to a crisp.  Another person in our group ordered wings. After about 45 minutes she asked the server when her wings would be coming.  The server said she brought them awhile ago and gave them to some \"dark haired\" woman at the other end of the table.  The unlimited chips and salsa mean nothing other than a consolation prize and even the salsa isn't that great.  There are plenty of other places in the area to get decent mexican food.  After going to Salty Senorita's, I can say this isn't one of them.  If you are simply looking for a cool place to hang out and get drinks, then this place is it but I recommend you eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you are going for high priced week drinks with a side of shitty wait staff this is your place to go. I was not impressed, food was great but will not be going back just because of the wait staff."}
{"text":"It is what it is, decent prices on booze and a cool setup. Food quality is extremely low though so don't expect much from any food item here. The nachos for example are worse than 711 and the salsa is Pace picante sauce."}
{"text":"This place where do I start honestly? Went last Thursday for lunch & like all the other yelpers said, theres still a wait because the hostess and the waitress are the same person. (Hire people. Makes no sense you barely have guest and you still have no hostess waiting to seat people). We entered the side which points to the \"hostess\" area to be seated, no hostess so as I'm looking around all perplexed the waitress as she walks by,  tells us to sit anywhere. We pass the bar area & make our way to the open back part. We go in take a seat, it takes a few minutes for the same waitress to come & give us menus, took longer to get our drinks. Seems like,  no wait,  she was the only waitress working during lunch hour too. With this kind of service, they SHOULD carry on the Mexican tradition and offer complimentary chips & salsa.     Anyways, so it's happy hour & since its a \"Mexican-----(NOT) restaurant I justtttt knew they would have some good margaritas during this time----(NOT). They advertise on their menu margarita(s) plural but that wasn't the case. They only have ONE margarita on their happy hour menu. The Senor---- should be renamed to the Peasant cos that drink DEF wasn't the MAN. It tasted like straight up, cheap liquor mixed in with some old mix/water that only a wino wouldn't mind. Terrible, yuck.    The food, wooooowww.  I can't even.  First off, we got the shrimp & fish ceviche, it was so flavorless,  it was ridiculous. Taste nothing like a REAL home grown Mexican restaurant ceviche where you can taste the flavor of spices, lime juice, etc. I don't think they even use SALT at SALTYS. And why was it served with just lettuce you are suppose to use as \"cups\"?? I read it on the menu but I just knew some crackers or tostadas or something would come along with. Nope, let's just say I couldn't even eat it.   How are you suppose to eat Ceviche with lettuce cups or a fork?! It just wasn't right. Ugh. Anyway, it tasted more fishy than anything. So, I got it instead to go & had to stop off at the store to buy what usually comes with it. (I hate when they try to change stuff for the worse. May look good but its completely useless if you can't hold the ceviche up on a lettuce end).   The mango shrimp taco too was nothing worth a thumbs up and too bad becos it sounded really good with the pina, mango sauce, etc.   And, sad too mention really but I also found a hair in my ceviche. Sho did & it seemed like nobody even cared, honestly. Although I seen the airhead Hawaiian looking tan \"rad\" beach bum manager going around asking guest how their service went, we didn't get the same treatment. He just brought back our new dish and mumbled something about being sorry about that.   Not a good experience & it looks more like a Hawaiian restaurant than Mexican with tiki head decors rather than Olmecs. Anyway, on to the next.   Disappointed,  good location tho right at the corner before entering old town Scottsdale. But parking, it's not in that big ol' parking spot right next to it. That parking belongs to a pizza place so on the street parking it is."}
{"text":"Like the out door seating.  Great atmosphere.  Liked the street tacos.  Great location at the Peoria ball park.  Hard to find wait staff sometimes."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a 2nd chance when I saw a groupon for half off. We found a picnic table right by a game of cornhole. Had a few drinks, played a few games, and hung out with our dogs. Our server was friendly and even brought a take out container with water for the pups. We have been back a couple of times since, and always have a fun time. The atmosphere is like no other. I really liked the prickly pear margarita, even at $8 and in a plastic cup :P"}
{"text":"I went to the Salty Senorita for dinner with friends. It has a great outdoor patio and looks like it would be fun for a night out. The street tacos were nothing special and the service was not good. We got our tacos before the chips and salsa arrived. I would not recommend this place for its food and the beer selection was limited."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. You have to wait and wait for your food. Never enough servers. ALWAYS have to fetch our own beers. We try to do taco Tuesdays with a group of 10 or more and everyone complains all around us. Sucks, nice place bad service. Manager always gives us attitude."}
{"text":"Take two on my review, as apparently the first disappeared.  We stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon. No one was there.  They had an all day happy hour, and great lunch specials.    Mexican bento is the greatest idea I have seen in awhile. The food was fresh and fast.  Open air concept does attract the flies, with all the sweet liquor bottles and fragrant foods.  We enjoyed a nice lunch, few drinks and moved on to the local shops nearby.  Great location. I can see why Salty Senorita is so popular. This could definitely be a place I would like to hang out if we lived in AZ again.    Waitress brought my husband a birthday dessert with a candle."}
{"text":"Delayed in writing this review, but we had a pretty terrible experience to start. We had a group of 10 people going to dinner here for a going away party for a friend going into the Navy, on a Tuesday night in the spring. Most of us arrived and sat down within 15 minutes of getting our table. The server took our drink orders, and over 30 minutes later we still did not have our drinks or appetizers that were ordered. The server was nowhere to be found, not even helping other tables around us. Once we were finally so frustrated about the lack of service we asked for a manager at the front desk. After hearing of our experience he then ended up serving us the remainder of the night and we did not see the original server again. The food and drinks were alright, once we finally got service from the manager. He did end up taking care of some of the food costs which was appreciated and he did what he could to try to make it right. Being honest though, I wasn't that impressed with the quality and flavor of the food nor was the remainder of our group, and don't find myself ever desiring to go back regardless of the bad service to start. I was a server for a busy seafood restaurant for 5 years, and understand how tough the job can be at times. I almost always give a second chance to restaurants that I like the food but get bad service. This is not one that I will go back to, especially if desiring authentic mexican food. Thanks to the manager for trying to make it up to us that night though, he really did a good job otherwise. The 2 stars is based on the food as well as the initial service."}
{"text":"We came here originally by accident.  Then we came 2 more times since.  I have never had poor service and the food is always delish.  I have read other reviews that said you have to wait on weekends.  Of course you do.  Its not Mcdonalds, but its not 30 mins of waiting either.  Their happy hour food is great and their beer prices during this time are hard to beat.  The wait staff are great and parking is easy to find.  We are helped within a minute of walking in.  The outdoor patio is great.  You will enjoy yourself here."}
{"text":"My friends and I went here after waiting an HOUR AND A HALF across the street at RnR (which I'd never go to again). I was already annoyed by that, but our waitress Chelsea made up for it and gave us great customer service. The food and drinks were great.  I'd definitely come back.   Also, they have bottomless mimosas on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the perfect spot to watch the game. Our server Maria was AWESOME! Try the fundito!!"}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner. We have been there many times before. Service is usually very slow. Food is usually pretty decent. However, last night we were in for a disgusting kitchen show. Their kitchen is quite open, so customers can see in. The cook last night was NASTY. He was dirty, greasy, and unkempt. As we watched, he started eating food off of the plates as he was putting them up in the window to be picked up by the waitress. He put his hand (ungloved) directly into the bin of chips and started eating those as well. Never once did he stop to wash his hands or use gloves the entire time we watched. And he just kept preparing food. Unfortunately we had already eaten before we noticed all of this or we would have walked out. Needless to say, we will be looking for a new taco place. Sad."}
{"text":"Second review , because this time they were actually open, yay. They get 3 stars for the sand volleyball, horseshoe pits, cornball, and close proximity to the baseball games at Peoria Sports Complex. BUT the service was whack, so I took a star away. Took forever for our waitress to come, then took forever for our beer re-orders.  The \"award winning\" margarita was just meh. The carnitas tacos? - don't bother, super greasy.  The one food plus - the calamari taco, yum!  Bottomless chips and salsa? Laughable- waiter took our chips mid-service and never returned, lol.  Insane service.  Go for beer and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Great margaritas and the cheese I think it was fundido was so good. Our waitress Friday night was so fun and enthusiastic with us. She had an awesome personality! Cool environment in this place with a fun vibe. The street view on the patio is quite nice and entertaining. Patio is nice and spacious. Definitely recommend coming here plus I love Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Well it lived up to its name. My salad was very salty. Food is mediocre and so were the margaritas. I will drive to cave creek for my mexican food because you can't beat El Encanto."}
{"text":"Met here with some friends on a Sunday evening. Honestly, this is. 1/5 for vegetarians. Their veggie burrito bowl is not fully vegetarian. The rice and beans are made with chicken broth! I ended up getting the veggie tacos and the asparagus taco.   I requested for the veggie taco to not have the rice and beans however it came with it and I noticed it in the first bite. I sent them back and traded them for the asparagus instead. They tasted much better anyhow. They offered free chips and salsa. The margarita selection looked quite delicious.  It's unlikely that I'll return. Not because of bad service or anything, but more so lack of options for vegetarians/vegans. For drinks, maybe."}
{"text":"This place is HUGE. It's like a small Mexican village, complete with volleyball courts, cornhole, patio areas, dance floors, and a kitchen and multiple bar areas. It was a really cool, laidback vibe going on.  They had buckets of Pacifico for 6/$18; not a bad deal. One of our group had a sandwich of some sort and it was apparently pretty good, 'cause he ate the whole thing. Our server was really chill, cracking jokes, and was attentive.   We played some volleyball, got down on the dance floor for a little while, and spent a fun Saturday night at Salty. It was a really nice change from the Scottsdale scene I'm trapped in.  The only thing I'd change is the DJ; they kept playing full 4 minute songs, mostly 2000s rap/hip-hop, and nothing that was on the charts right now... I felt like I was back at high school homecoming. They didn't have anything my friend requested either."}
{"text":"Walked in at 9:40. Ready to order right away because the kitchen closed at 10. Got a short and rude \"greeting\" and waved her hand in the air and said \"I guess sit anywhere\" as she walked away. Didn't get menus for another 9-10 minutes. As soon as the waitress, the same one that met us at the door, finally brought us menus, she slapped them on the table and told us we needed to order right that second. We were not asked for drink orders or even given a name. we took that as a sign that we would not be getting good service and left."}
{"text":"Marquel was a great waitress. Queso was salty, chips are light and not greasy. Guacamole left a lot to be desired although it was fresh. Margaritas taste like bottle mix, could be much better. Service is good, food mediocre!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worse service I have had. Our waiter missed 1 order then came back ten minutes later and said it would take 20 more minutes to get the chicken burrito that he missed.  I asked for the management and when he came over 10 minutes later he told us they are busy and it would take 20 more minutes to get the missing order. I will never go back here even if it was free. Very bad service and lack of care for there customers."}
{"text":"Food poisoning, over priced, and mediocre service. I was there last night. The fish tacos  were small, $4 each, & have made me terribly sick today & unable to work. I asked the server a question she couldn't answer and she never sought help from her staff. But I did. And I got an answer. Also had to hunt down my own napkins, then salt and pepper, clean up my sons spilled drink by myself, and ask for a refill when the empty glass was right in front of her. Just sayin..."}
{"text":"Food was average at best. Friendly bar staff. But not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been in Scottsdale for a month of spring training and have been here several time! Always good times. Fallon helped us this recent time and she's awesome!"}
{"text":"Had a new waitress Alexa and she was amazing!! The happy hour food was great especially the fundido!! And tons of drinks....yum!"}
{"text":"Location is great to old town and the atmosphere is nice, modern and a little trendy.  Food was honestly just ok. We had 2 of the most adorable tacos. They were tiny and ok . The chicken burrito was pretty good but nothing earth shattering.  You have to pay for chips and salsa which were quite good and well I just wasn't blown away. Good luck with the men's room!"}
{"text":"I have been a few times, usually happy hour when I would treat those that make it able for to pay my mortgage, so I expect it to be crowded and bit slow. However went here one night with a date to kill some time before my daughter would be home after going to her first high school dance and really wish I had stayed in the school parking lot and caught a nap. The service on the Friday was just horrible and the place would not have been remotely considered crowded sine we took outdoor seats by the fence of the outfield. After sitting for at a table for close to 30 minutes and enjoying the conversation I was having we realized that we had not received one bit of service from a sole on staff there. I actually went to the bar and got drinks and was greeted with courteous and pleasant manner and did have to wait too long after my arrival at the bar to get my order and return to to my table or should I say section since the the area we sat it was not at all crowded. Half through our drinks (now in there about 50 minutes) a little perky waitress with the worst attitude shows up and says \" oh i see u have drinks I will be back later.\" My date at this time whim I actually have known for years and is normally very reserved asked if it would be possible to order food or is the kitchen closed, The response she received was an extremely and sarcastic remark in the lines of this is a place where we serve food and things went down hill from there. After a few seconds of going back we dismissed the young lady and requested to see the manager. Once he showed it was as if he had a 3 option plan to resolve issues and that was it, unfortunately none of the options where at all what we wanted. We noticed the time and realized we needed to leave but realized it was actually time to leave to be home to greet my daughter. The manager to his credit realizing we had felt satisfied offered to pay for a cab for us to get home. Now if you read this far you will see I have had one drink which I Have not finished because the waitress. I asked if I appeared to have already had to many drinks and he says well that it was his staff had advised him. At this point I would say I had not showing how upset I was so being the size I am (6'2 and I make it to the gym 4-6 times a week) I made sure him and his staff and the bouncers pretending they had something else to do I had not had the opportunity to get intoxicated because f the horrible service and he could take the cab offer and not suggest again. I will admit that I am glad I did not fall back on my youthful instincts because I realize that any place that would have a bimbo, a total inept moron and bouncers with courage of a cowardly lion they deserve to hopefully loose their liquor license some day."}
{"text":"I was in town from Chicago and we stopped at Salty Señorita for a few drinks.  JK was our bartender and he was incredibly attentive and gave us really good suggestions on what we should try.  Food and drinks both were outstanding but would def go back for the great service!!!"}
{"text":"So for as long as i've worked in scottsdale this was my first experience at Salty Senorita and it was amazing. Everyone was very friendly and nice. The bar didn't have open seats so we sat at a high top. Immediately a server came up and asked if we would like anything to drink and brought us some water. Our server, Amanda, went over the specials with us and talked a little bit about the menu. I asked for some suggestions and she said we should try the guacamole. We did and it was amazing. The crab flautas are absolutely phenomenal as well!!! Amanda was such an awesome server and was quick with everything and answered all of our questions. She made the experience even better! love it here and will def be back and hopefully be in Amanda's section again!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor atmosphere. Inside dinning too! Food was very good and Margaritas were great.  We always enjoy Salty Señorita.  Our waiter seemed lazy & disorganized which made today's experience les enjoyable.  Normally the service her is crisp & friendly!"}
{"text":"Had a good time here with some friends.  The food is on the cheap, beer is cheap and the setting is great outdoors.  Since its not really hot yet I can deal with the outdoor scene and the huge open patio area.  Check it out with some friends.  A nice, busy, outdoor place to grab a drink."}
{"text":"Love their Salty Senoritas aka Cadillac margaritas!  Lovely patio, great ambience, good service from the bartenders - will be definitely back to try the ceviche and guac!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service even for our large party. The specials were delicious and filling. I especially like the box lunch option, it was actually more than I could finish. Loved the margaritas too!  Restrooms were nice and clean. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"came here for lunch with some friends and our bad luck it was a spring training game for some team.  unlucky for us because they had a limited menu because of this game.  its only spring training haha who cares and what restaurant only has a special menu for spring training.    our drink we got had little to no alcohol and we had to actually ask them to put more liquor in it.  no point in spending 10 bucks a drink on a fruity non alcoholic drink.  food was ok. nothing special.  just was the only place that a seat available. i see why now"}
{"text":"I don't know what we thought we were walking into from the outside. The decor was... Interesting? Uniforms didn't match the atmosphere. But, the waitstaff was very nice and knowledgable. The nachos were great, I honk I should've stopped there. I didn't care for the chicken enchiladas. If I were to come back to AZ I would try it out again though."}
{"text":"Great service. Loved my chicken enchiladas   Although they were a little spicy for me, the sour cream did the trick.  Came with black beans and rice. Plenty of food.   Our server was very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"Where to start, this was my first time here and my experience was obviously not the best. We sat inside for two minutes but I'm assuming the AC was broken or they chose to not have it on. In AZ this is a necessity. We asked to sit outside because the atmosphere was nice and the misters were on. The waitress moved us with no issue. The misters soaked our table to the point where we needed our table wiped down.. Which the waitress wiped it with a wet rag? Anyways, the chips and salsa were awful but the rest food was decent just not worth the price. We switched out a plate because the menu didn't specify and wasn't what we were expected, that went okay. At the end half of the party was leaving and when they gave the waitress gift cards which covered most of the tab and then cash to cover the rest, for some reason she took the full amount of cash and ran the gift cards for the rest. So what's the point of the gift cards if we pay with cash?! No, obviously no common sense! We wanted to use the gift cards then the rest in cash, anyone would know this. The service was slow and then when she couldn't figure out how to cash us out, that was the last straw. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Walked in and sat at the bar.  Seriously, over ten minutes before I was greeted.  No happy hour at 4:00 on Tuesday.  The bartender gave me a draft in a hot glass.  Everything was ala cart.  Tacos were ok.  I watched the bartender grab hanging glassware putting her fingers in the glasses.  Nasty!  Bud lights are $5.  What a joke!  This place used to be good.  What the hell happened???"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out despite a couple bad reviews I read on here strictly  due to the location and outdoor seating.  I was HIGHLY disappointed.  To start with the good:  -They do have a great outdoor patio right next to the ballpark.   -They also offer sand volleyball. Jenga, corn hole, and ping pong.    Now for the bad: -We pulled up and the place was virtually empty during happy hour. -We sat outside on the patio and they only had one TV on showing the local news - no sports. -I ordered a house margarita for the happy hour price and they charged me double when i got the bill.  They then try to say that margarita was not on special and they rung it in wrong. -My wife and I ordered nachos with beans and sour cream on the side - we received them with beans and sour cream all over.  Not to mention the look of them totally was unappetizing.  -They brought out our tacos (entree) with the appetizer. -My wife ordered one of the fish tacos and they contained Basa Fish - I asked the manger what this was and he explained its a cousin of the Mahi also know as Swai.  Doing some research, its basically a cheap fish restaurants use and is a bottom dwelling catfish.  I am no fish expert, but there is something 'FISHY' about this. -They never asked us if we wanted corn our flour tortillas with our tacos. -The played the same loop of music over and over the speaker system. -I ordered a Negra Modelo beer - I am under the impression that this should be served with a lime, which was non existent. -I witnessed a waitress drop a lime on the ground delivering drinks to the table - it was still there when we left like they don't care. -The one waitress keeps her bill fold/Credit card holder stuck inside her spandex pants by her butt crack. -I had  a free appetizer coupon and it took the manager two times to actually remove it form my bill. -The restrooms were not clean and all soap dispensers were empty - did I mention they were not busy at all during this time.  Obviously we will not be back.  I urge you to save your money and try a new spot despite their great location and outdoor patio."}
{"text":"The Al a carte Tacos are all fabulous. The staff is friendly, attentive but sometimes seemed to struggle. They were about 1/2 full, but the owner was funny & involved. We ate near the street & enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. The table side guacamole was average but authentic. Margaritas are good, but average. Atmosphere Attracts a Fun crowd."}
{"text":"The food and the drinks were very good. However, we got ABSOLUTELY no attention until the bill came. My friends and I were seated on the patio at a table with a mister nearby. Misters are very useful when the temp is around 100. However, it was evening and in the 80s when we showed. We moved to a dry table on our own after ordering. We waited quite a while and finally flagged someone down to ask for chips and salsa. These ended up being very good.   I ordered enchiladas and one friend ordered sliders and the other a burrito. We were all happy with our meals but the service was horrible AND we got charged for chips and salsa. Who does that? This may be a decent place to get a drink but I would never go back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Ive got so day that this place has the worst customer service and the food is just ok. We had a group of 8 people on a Friday afternoon and it was hardly busy at all. Sat and waited for about 15 minutes before anyone came up to give us menus. We actually had witnessed several servers dancing with each other in front of guests and especially us while waiting for someone to come for the first time. We finally walked up to one of the servers to ask who's serving us. From there we ordered food and some drinks and while 3 of the 4 people got their food, the 4th had to wait close to 10-15 minutes to get hers. Although she did order a few minutes after us. One of our friends didn't even get any silverware for her food, and none of us received any napkins. We had to ask for everything which took a long time. I not any of my group will be back again as I couldn't believe how terrible service was and how unprofessional the servers were. Most need to be fired...."}
{"text":"Unlimited chips & salsa, the best margarita in town and super cheap Pacificos = win. Best place to go hang out outside and relax. Pro-tip, sign up for upromise and you'll receive cash back on purchases here.  Your money will go a long way here and that is a great thing."}
{"text":"When we arrived it was bare. No one wanted to help us. Looked at menu before we came.. it was nothing like the one they gave us. They didn't even have a kids menu. Horrible service, not sure if this is a locals place or what... but people were so rude. We sat down for 5 minutes then left."}
{"text":"Volleyball night isn't that same without an amazing server (Kelly) who goes out of her way to provide quick service.."}
{"text":"\"Hi my name is Ashley and I'll be taking care of you. It's happy hour (pointing at the menu), the drink specials are there and the food specials there. Because it's happy hour you may not modify anything in anyway.\"  Hi Ashley.  Awkward.  Arrived with my bestie for happy hour and it was early so the place was empty. I mean empty. Like Paris Hilton's head empty. Totally cool. I was already LOVING the huge patio overlooking a beautiful park/baseball field.   We enjoyed HH margaritas (tasty!), taquitos (oddly only two, but, hey, it's HH) and a BUTT LOAD tray of nachos (awesome, I must say).  My company was so lovely, by the time we left, I hadn't noticed the small crowd of folks who had wandered in, so I can't speak of the crowd.   OK service. Great view of the park. Fabulous prices on the margs and nachos.  Most of all. Great company!"}
{"text":"Came here for my 21st birthday to start off at and the service was just not attentive at all! my friends and I were waiting and waiting and waiting for our drinks and to order and to get silver wear ect. Finally someone who was NOT our server was walking near our table and we had to flag someone down and she was kind enough to help us out and find our server but it still took her 10 min to get back to our table. Getting our checks was just as bad. it was a slow Sunday and I just don't see why she could not be attentive o us at all."}
{"text":"Tried this place once in the old location and it was terrible.. not much else has changed in the new location... and really $3 for chips and salsa? Food was terrible.  Had three different types of tacos (grilled Fish, Carne Asada and braised short rib) and they just didn't do it for me.  No flavor - needed to ask for limes and salsa to even make it decent. They give you tap water that actually tastes like dirty water from the canal and the house margarita is probably the grossest thing I have ever tasted.  Zero tequila and nasty sweet and sour mix.  Blah  Stick to bottled beer and you should be good!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I went to a spring training game in Peoria so I stopped in at Salty's pregame to get some food and a start on my beer consumption.  I got the street tacos with chicken and chipotle cream sauce.  They were pretty good tender chicken and lot's of it.  The chipotle sauce gave it just enough smokey flavor and kick.  The chips and salsa were actually really good as well.  They have great prices on beers during Spring Training and after the game it's happy hour which was nice."}
{"text":"Love Salty's! We always have the best service from Jeremy!!! We are always taken care of well by the rest of the staff as well! Management is always friendly and remembers us by name when we come in! - Not only is the service awesome but the Food and Drinks are GREAT!! One of the best Scottsdale Happy Hours!!!"}
{"text":"Later in the evening after a ball game we were looking for a place to eat. We drove by this Salty Senorita and it had lots of tables available so we decided to give it a try. My first weird experience was when I went to the restroom and it was a disaster - paper all over the floor, garbage overflowing - the kind of thing you might see on a nightclub restroom at 2am. The other disappointment was the service. Our server was polite enough but very indifferent towards us. Almost grumpy. She made no effort to \"sell\" us on anything and no real personal touch to the service. A real disappointment. The food was excellent. We had queso fundido and fajitas. No complaints there. But when the service is bad, and the food is good, it still makes for a bad experience."}
{"text":"Just a big shout out to John Maryak and the crew at Salty Señorita for the wonderful food, drink, and exceptional service at the Happy Hour we hosted last week prior to our son's wedding. The Margaritas are fabulous and the prices are so reasonable - you have to try it! And loved the fire pit and local good vibes. You're a treasure John and we will be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night for the first time, and we will never go back.  We didn't know that it is really only a place for drinking, not eating.  The chips were greasy and all broken in small pieces.  The salsa was not anything I would want to eat again.  My husband ordered the tortilla soup and he said it was ok.  I ordered the fish tacos and took one bite.  It didn't taste right.  My husband tried one bite and had to spit it in to his napkin.  They were bad.  Spoiled or something.  My side of sour cream was warmish, not cold.  My husband tried his chili cornbread and it was burned, greasy, and not cooked through in the middle.  I had ordered a side of guacamole and it was overly salty and did not taste fresh or right either.    I noticed that there was a prep area near the edge of the restaurant where waitresses cut avocados and scooped them out.  Bottles of their \"salsa\" were left out and not returned to the tubs of ice, where I assume they were supposed to go.  It did not look clean or well maintained.  Vile!  We told the waitress that the fish tacos were bad and they did take it off our bill, but to be honest they could have taken everything off the bill.  Nothing was worth paying for!  No wait, my husband had a margarita and he said it was pretty good.  So that's it.  I guess the Salty Senorita is a loud  annoying place to have a good margarita and a decent bowl of tortilla soup."}
{"text":"Ill start with the positive - the décor is amazing.. the patio is really nice especially on a cooler day where you can sit and enjoy. We were there during happy hour BF got the house margarita and he liked it so much he had 2, or maybe 3. My Aunt and I split a margarita flight and opted for the frozen drinks.. came with prickly pear, mango and strawberry. All were on the sweet side but super tasty and VERY strong... we would have been falling off our stools if we each had a flight. I mixed the mango and prickly pear and it was muy bueno! The bad - they bring out a big bottle of water... it had stuff floating in it, we let the waitress know and she brings another.. stuff floating in this one as well. Our guess was the dishwasher was not getting all the stuff out which is pretty yuck... especially since we had already started drinking the water before noticing."}
{"text":"Bar tender saved this review.   Fundido arrived at the same time as our tacos with no excuses nor explanation. I was very upset because we held off eating chips waiting for our \"appetizer\". We watched with sad puppy-dog eyes as Fundido, after Fundido left the kitchen. It really is a can't miss with its chunks of peppers, onions, etc. See later comment.   We sat at the bar. There WAS dust everywhere. A thin layer covering every surface. Even the bartender had to get different plates bc they were filthy. How hard is it to wipe down your surfaces? This makes me cringe - what else isn't cleaned?  Taco review time: Shrimp taco with rajas and mole verde soaked through the tortilla and was in a greasy wet sauce w avocado slice and like 3 thin slivers of onion. It was texturally not pleasing, but the shrimp was cooked well, despite being slimy.  Pork carnitas taco was not dry and pretty good with the fundido on top.  Marcos fish taco with blackened mahi taco was very salty but neutralized with a spicy chipotle sauce.  Calamari taco was a little one-note following the Marcos fish taco. It had the same sauce as blackened mahi, cabbage mix... Nothing special or particularly memorable.  Estellas fish taco with mango shouldn't be saved for last bc it was so mushy. Not very well balanced and best described as, oh, not bad.  Kindly, the bartender brought us a new basket of chips (our other one might have been the end if the bag with bits of broken pieces). Unfortunately, some chips were so loaded with salt that the salt crystals flew off the chip when I broke it for dipping. And it wasn't just one chip. Now I'm inspecting each chip for excess salt.  And saved... No charge for fundido bc as bartender explained, it was ridiculous to wait 20 minutes.  I'd consider returning because of the outdoor area and I think I know how to order and what to order. I'll just not order tacos until I receive my fundido."}
{"text":"I personally really like Salty's ... during the week or during the day on the weekends. I love the chips and salsa and the chicken tacos, the margaritas are great and it is a nice place to go sit outside during a Saturday afternoon with friends. They allow my pup to come with us, always check to make sure he has enough water and the manager came over to visit him several times the first time we brought him ... then brought him the cutest little shirt which was left over from a rescue dog fundraiser they hosted. Anyone who loves rescue dogs is ok with me. During the day, the crowd is pretty laid back. On weekend nights, the crowd seems to be a little bit rowdy, but there are plenty of other places in the neighborhood to visit ... so we have just decided to designate it as the perfect Saturday afternoon spot with the pup and friends. I have always had good service here and think that the decor is fun. If you are looking for a Scottsdale type place to hang out, you're probably in the wrong neighborhood to begin with ... and if you are upset that it is dirty ... we do live in the middle of the desert.  If you are looking for a fun, casual outdoor , spot  I'd definitely recommend it. I'd recommend the beer, the strawberry margarita, the chicken tacos and plenty of chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a shopping visit to Old Town Scottdale, looking for a quick drink and appetizer. Quick is a relative term. Had to ask the bar if we had a waitress. The Order for 5 drinks, two of which were just vodka over ice (more on that later) took close to 20 minutes. Good thing they have bottomless chips and salsa.   The place was pretty dirty overall. Glasses, silverware and the table, which was not wiped down before we were seated. Service was ok but not great.   My Margarita, listed as the most popular, was not good in spite of the time it took to make. Too much ice and not enough liquid. The fix it yourself bloody mary bar for the vodka over ice was weak on ingredients- no horse radish.  This place is across the street from R and R, a loud vibrant bar. A deejay and dancing at 1:00 in the afternoon ? It was packed. I asked how Salty competes and was told they can't. Salty gets the overflow crowd, like us. My advise, find another overflow spot."}
{"text":"Food is very limited and not creative. Service was slow start but not bad. Nachos are canned cheese and canned jalepenos with some salsa and sour cream... hard to mess up. Great for the younger drinking crowd and socializing."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another chance after a terrible experience last time I visited the previous location. The new building had a funky odor going on inside so we opted for patio seating. As soon as we sat ourselves at one of the 7 open tables we were approached my a manager saying that we had to wait to be seated by the hostess. Upon mentioning all the vacant tables he told us that they were in the process of \"tracking down\" those people to seat them. So we stood up and lingered until we were given permission to sit back down at the same table.  The table side guac was great but the server never returned to take our order for entrees. We finally flagged down the manager who apologized and began taking our order until the server ran over to relieve him of her duty. He then told her how embarrassed he was for having to do that...awkward. We then continued to wait for our food for 30 minutes before I finally called the manager over again and told him they obviously forgot our order somewhere and we wanted to leave. For the negative experience he comped us a round of cheap girly shots (Washington apples or something) and presented the rest of the $25 bill."}
{"text":"Delicious! I was hesitant after reading the negative reviews... But maybe we just got lucky. Here on a Friday night, we rolled up to a front row parking spot and sat ourselves outside immediately. The Mexican Motor Oil drink was amazeballs, recommend if you're an ice tea fan. Came only for drinks but ultimately couldn't resist the appetizing menu. The queso dip app was fantastic as was the grilled shrimp tacos. Mmmmm. And can't forget the service with a smile! Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Exceptional service, solid margaritas and great food. Started the day here wayyy tooo early and went home to take a nap. Came back for a night cap. Did it all over again at night. Might call me a regular? Just call me someone that has good taste! Makes sure to ask for Arielle for that exceptional service"}
{"text":"Came for brunch and turned out to be a great spot. Had the breakfast burrito and churros (yes for breakfast). My wife says the salsa and chips were like she remembers as a kid in Phoenix. Nick was our bartender and took great care of us. We will be back for Taco Tuesday"}
{"text":"My family and I came to this location on a Saturday morning to enjoy some drinks and shareable plates. It was so quiet when we arrived that I was worried they were closed. Luckily they were opened with just a few customers at the bar.   We ordered a round of drinks and appetizer plates that included: chicken quesadilla, ceviche and taquitos. The food was okay, nothing to complain about but also nothing to rave about.   However, the reason for my lower review is due to the service and lack of urgency or attentiveness. If this location was incredibly busy or understaffed, we would understand why it was slower or harder for our waitress to keep up on our orders or requests. The unfortunate thing is it wasn't busy. It took a very long time to order, receive our food and drinks. At one point we gave our card in advance to pay but she didn't check on us in a while to ask for extra orders, give the check or even run the card.  It's unfortunate that the experience wasn't worthwhile and even made me think back to how quiet it was when we arrived. I wonder if the food and service could be the cause. I hope they get better, it's a great area and there is a lot of potential."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend last night (first time at the new location.) It was dead. They had live music which was pretty good but kind of loud. Our waitress was attentive and nice.   However... I got the regular Salty margarita and it was probably the worst marg I've ever had. It was SO sweet I was literally struggling to finish it. I love margaritas usually, but this was just bad bad bad. Nothing on the menu looked that great so we just stuck with chips and salsa (average salsa).   Probably won't be returning. You can get a better margarita down the street at Loco Patron or Z Tejas."}
{"text":"Pretty legit! Good food and the margaritas were awesome... ask for Mathew's section, you won't be disappointed. We'll definitely be back next time we're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"What a fun Happy Hour spot! Great service, great food & fun atmosphere! Totally going back!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke first off we went to the bar asked if the kitchen was still open she goes it closes in 15 mins we ask for a menu she goes \"actually just go sit at a table its easier\"....like ok you obviously just don't wanna take our order. So we sit at a table 4 servers walk by no one talks to us.... some skinny brown haired girl walks by at least 5 times before she stops and asks have you guys been helped? Like no we obviously haven't we've been staring at you and there's literally not even water in front of us??? And then acts surprise that we haven't been helped. So my friend goes we wanted to order food but not sure if we can do that now and she addresses this by saying \"well if you order like right this second you can get food\" takes our order then walks off never to be seen again didn't even offer us waters! Like I'm pretty sure we live in az it's 100 degrees out. Plain and simple I won't be back, no wonder this place has 2 stars and it's dirty between the tAble tops and the sticky food covered menus it was disgusting."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a fun place with good food and drinks. We drove by Salty's and quickly decided we were in the mood for margarita's and it looked promising. There wasn't a wait, so we're we're excited to get seated quickly! Our server was friendly and offered suggestions for margaritas. Unfortunately, the margaritas were not good. Both of us got specialty margaritas and they were way too sweet with what seemed like barely any alcohol in them (but maybe the sweet flavor masked the tequila). We got tacos and they were really disappointing too. We were really hoping that the food and drinks would be at least adequate, but everything other than the service was really lacking. The pricing was what you would expect in old town, which made the poor food and drink feel way too expensive. With so many other options in the area, I would skip this place."}
{"text":"I was not expecting much from Salty Senorita but I was impressed when we got there.  I felt like we parked really far away and came upon  the lot of a \"Mexico\" film set.  It was more busy than usual because of the Cinco de Mayo drinking starting up.  Our drinks were good.  -- well every one was drinking beer but me so how can you mess up  a bottle of beer?    The food was surprisingly good for being such a party atmosphere.  The chips are good chips-- like the real kinda greasy kind.  Not overly greasy, just a nice amount and they were salted with kosher salt--- fabulous!  I had the pork street tacos and they were delicious.  It came with 3 of them and a side of mexican rice that was more like dirty rice-- still good.  and a side of pinto beans with a light sprinkling of cheese.    Good food, good atmosphere, good service.  I wasn't expecting so much from Salty Senorita- shame on me!"}
{"text":"Tried to come here to eat lunch with my family just now... the hostess was nice and sat us outside. Multiple waitresses walked by us and didn't offer us water and no one ever came to take our order. So after sitting there for about 30 minutes and no one acknowledging we were there, we left... we will never know if the food was good or not. Needless to say, I'm salty about it."}
{"text":"I went here with the wife and a couple friend's on Cinco de mayo and it was standing room only.  We did find a table to sit at,  but after over an hour we decided to leave due to never getting served.  We really liked how the place was set up so we are going to give this place another shot and see if this is the norm."}
{"text":"Leia is a princess off a girl Great time with old and new friends alike great reasonably priced nourishment"}
{"text":"Salty Señorita is right next to the Padres Spring Training Complex so convenient to hangout between practice & game. Shelby was attentive and apologetic since the wave of fans overwhelmed the joint. The food took awhile but was worth the wait. The Taco Salad w/ Mahi-Mahi was the best my wife has ever had. I had the Woody Burger w/ waffle fries - excellent. My son had street tacos but be forewarned they are good but very small. They lost a star because they do not have any draft beer or blended margaritas (add a star if you like your margaritas on the rocks). You can watch minor leaguers playing right next to the patio."}
{"text":"We decided to do an early Mexican dinner before seeing a movie and just happened upon this place. We decided to eat inside because of the heat. We're sat at a huge booth in back but were attacked by hundreds of flies! Food was awesome but the fly situation put a BIG damper on the meal!"}
{"text":"Not sure I like it as much as Dos Gringos... but it's pretty close. I love the giant outdoor patio area, the view of the baseball fields, the food is great too. Sometimes the service isn't the greatest though :("}
{"text":"Just came here with friends since Oldtown seems to have something against the 3 to 7 PM happy hour. Had the happy hour tacos $2 each and got them as a lettuce wrap Low carb option. These are the best tacos I've tasted for under two bucks! I plan on coming back, so the reason for the three stars unfortunately the service was a little bad and I got charged $1 for salsa? I think they stop giving out free chips and salsa I could be wrong but who knows"}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about. I think people go there for the street side theatrics. I ordered ceviche appetizer which turned out to be guacamole with cooked fish and shrimp, not ceviche at all. Also got two tacos of which one fell apart completely as I tried to eat it. Too many choices when it come to restaurants in Scottsdale and this one I will pass up next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I ordered tacos while I was here yesterday and they were absolutely AMAZING! The carne asada ones were my fave. Speaking of faves, our bartender was JK and I'd come back just to chat it up with him! Charming, knowledgeable and easy on the eyes! I would definitely suggest it to anyone who finds themselves in the Old Town area"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drinks and dinner on a Saturday. Seated immediately. But there was no one to serve our table.  After going back to the hostess asking if there was a server for our table we waited again. Finally decided to leave. As we stood up a young gal came to the table did not introduce herself just said your leaving    Ok.  We decided to give her a chance.   We asked her for three drinks Which were delivered. Since the server seemed hurried we asked for our check.   The check stated the server was April W never saw her at our table again. Sadly she had plenty of time to hug other servers and chat with other young folks.  We Went somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Salty Senorita has always been one of our favorite places to go to and take out of town friends.  We tried the \"new\" Salty last night and it was one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had.  The service was pretty well non existant.  The food was  expensive and bad.  I am afraid if they do not convert quickly back to what was working for them and made them so popular they will not be around long."}
{"text":"Jim Snider or Amy Q, I am absolutely reviewing the right location. If you read my review I was talking about pricing and not portion size."}
{"text":"Ruben is the best bartender ever!!!!!! We are from cali and he made us feel like we're apart of the family. I know how hard it is to get an employee with such a great attitude and you have an asset with Ruben. I will return because of the way I was treated."}
{"text":"Good margarita. El senior (basic house margarita)  The ceviche was nice because it had crab and avocado but the fish and shrimp were eh.  For the price I probably wouldn't get it again, maybe try something with just crab next time.   Guy next to me said that the tacos were great $2 on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times already.  Salty's is a great place if you're looking for a good drink and a place to socialize outdoors.  That's what keeps us coming back.  Although the happy hours are decent, I wouldn't say the same for the food. Seems like it can all be easily prepared in the microwave. The only thing I've tried there that I would actually get again is the guac, but it's also something I can just make at home...  Overall, if you're looking for a good time, good drinks, good atmosphere and a fun time (esp. at night when there's a band or DJ), Salty's is a great place to go.  They also have a volleyball court and an area for bags (aka cornhole) and horseshoes, which is unique.  The two star rating would be higher if the drink specials were phenomenal, but they're not.  The food knocks down my opinion as well."}
{"text":"What happen to this place.  Why did i come here.  They have like 3 beers on tap.  This is why im not comeing back.  The food is over priced and not that good."}
{"text":"Went here on October 15th for a 30-year class reunion social (drinks & pre-ordered munchies).  The waitresses were efficient and attentive beer-slingers, and the food wasn't bad.  The band that was playing when a group of us got there (around 7:30pm) played way too loudly, and was way too average (bleh, in other words).  It might not have been so bad had we not been trying to catch up with one another....and if they weren't playing like they were headlining a concert."}
{"text":"I used to go to the one in North Scottsdale all the time. Have been to this one a number of times still has the same Vibe feel and fun friendly atmosphere. Great place for day drinking as well as food and evening time hanging out. Staff is always friendly attentive and there to help. If you're looking for a fun time with a Mexican Vibe check this spot out."}
{"text":"Went out to celebrate National  Margarita day with some friends.  It was a beautiful afternoon so we decided to ride our bikes up.  The patio was perfect and the waitress nice as can be.  Unfortunately the frozen margarita was broken (again) so we all opted for on the rocks. The margarita was the worst thing ever!  It looked and tasted like syrup! When mentioned to the waitress we got a shrug and a weak \"Oh I'm sorry\"  The food we ordered was ok but the tab was ridiculous the horrible margaritas were $7!!  We left and went to Macayos and enjoyed a delicious frozen margarita.  Thank you Macayos for saving the \"holiday\" and knowing on National Margarita day you should have one on special!"}
{"text":"Called quite a few places in Scottsdale to go have dinner and drinks to celebrate a wedding and most were in helpful. Tortilla flats being the worst. Called saltys and spoke to Sidney was incredible got me a whole back patio. She texted me pictures, asked what if there was any extra she good do. Went above and beyond. Ben the bartender super friendly. Samantha the manager very attentive. After party was ending they boxed all my decorations for me to pick up next day. Unbelievable service."}
{"text":"The seating process was quick and they gave us a good table for 4. However the service was not so good. They asked if we wanted salsa and chips, and after saying yes we never saw the salsa and chips till our meals came. Our drinks were never refilled. Not the best service in the world but the food was fantastic  Reply: thank you Jim for replying and taking time out of your day to comment on my opinion/experience. I appreciate the gesture. I will definitely ask for you, don't get me wrong half the experience is the service the food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was average at best. Both bar staff had each a group of friends in. Were distracted when a customer needed service. Salty Senorita cocktail was watery, not tangy or lime like at all. Mexican Mule was good, food pretty average, service disappointing. The reviews before i came here tonight were up and down..kind of like the service, food and drink quality..there is better mexican only a few doors up..go there instead."}
{"text":"By far my favorite veggiterian taco options in Arizona ! They are simple but delicious ! Great up beat atmosphere with amazing brunch options on sundays! Taco Tuesday deals are pretty good and there is no going wrong with any of their deserts either!!!"}
{"text":"I had the most amazing time here. Nick was our bartender and he was so friendly and recommended some amazing drinks. Our food came out quickly and was so good! I will definitely be going back when the heat breaks! I love that I can sit at the bar but still be outside. I think I overheard that they raffle bikes on Tuesdays? I'm not positive but that's such a cool idea."}
{"text":"Not a great experience.  Asked if we could sit at a high top in the bar.  Rudely told all seats had to be sat by the hostess.  After being seated had to wait 15 minutes to get a drink.  Beers were served in chipped glasses.  Nobody wanted to complain . Next round everybody switched to bottled beers except for 1 person.  His next beer was in a chipped glass.  He brought it to the  bar...next to our table.  The bartender didn't look surprised and poured the beer into a new glass...you guessed it.  Beyond all professional restaurant standards regarding pouring into a new glass but the new glass was also chipped.    Please go to plastic.  You don't chill your glasses, they are chipped and obviously your staff's lacking training.  You  were better before your expansion.  Focus on the right things...your customers.  These MLB fans have liked your restaurant in the past but buenos noches, we won't be back!"}
{"text":"Mary J's review said it best, \"How do you spell, 'bad'?.....S-A-L-T-Y  S-E-N-O-R-I-T-A\"  We came here last week while in Scottsdale for Mr. Booth's Bachelor party breakfast.  All the places that we wanted to go had 1-2 hour waits.  However, Salty was able to sit 9 of us right away.  After having the meal, I see why.  I ordered the Machaca and egg burrito.  The food was just not good.  I had bones in my meat, and the rice looked and tasted more like mashed potatoes.  How hard is it to cook white rice?  And who puts white rice in Mexican food?  A really bad Mexican restaurant does.  That is exactly what Salty is.  It should really be called \"Crappy Senorita,\"  Or to keep the alliteration, \"$hit*y Senorita.\"  I'll make sure I don't use inappropriate language on here so that this review does not get removed.  Anyway, when I come back to Scottsdale, I won't be returning here.  No gracias, no me gusta.  Halz3 did enjoy the chips and salsa though......  I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"Don't get all the new reviews.  Stopped here for lunch on memorial day, the food and service were bith pretty good."}
{"text":"Eh. Stopped in one Saturday afternoon for drinks after visiting some of the noisier places in Old Town Scottsdale. Only my friend was seated at the table - I was in the bathroom and my husband and my friend's boyfriend were outside, so out waitress only brought one water glass. When she saw the rest of our party she said she would bring more water glasses but I guess she forgot.  I had a bloody mary, which was a little spicy and pretty good. My friend had a couple different margaritas, each which she thought were fine. She was able to get one for only $1 after checking in at Salty Senorita on foursquare. My husband and friend's boyfriend had beer; the beer selection was pretty limited so if you don't like Negro Modelo I would stick to a cocktail or wine.  I thought the salsa was good, and the chips were fresh and crispy. The guacamole was extremely salty. It was edible, but seriously salty. After passing the one water glass around the table a few times, we flagged down our server for the bill and left.  I don't think I would go back, but we had a nice time despite the poor service and food. If you have some serious time on your hands and like salt, you might like Salty Senorita."}
{"text":"Average. Service is slow inside.  You have to flag someone down if you sit at a table.  Food was so so, price is high for what you get."}
{"text":"Tory was the most friendly and helpful, I had a great experience here tonight on cinco de mayo. Also the guy with the point tail was excellent! I love this place coming back for sure."}
{"text":"My friends and I just left the Phoenix Open and after a long day of walking all we were looking forward to was sitting down for some food and cold drinks.  We hadn't planned on that taking an hour and a half so that was really unfortunate.  When we came in we decided to sit at a booth because it was pretty chilly out.  It wasn't too busy, but we only counted 3 servers.  I think that was what caused the majority of our problems...  It took our waitress like 10 minutes before she came over to greet us with our bottle of water and glasses.  Because it took a while for her to came over we ordered drinks and chips and salsa.  Drinks took another 15 minutes so by the time they came we had already finished with our chips and were so hungry we almost ate the paper.    Two of our friends ordered the tacos which they said were decent.  I ordered the tinga burrito bowl.  Luckily the meat was good because the black eyed peas were an awkward addition and the rice was hard.  My other friend ordered the nachos (with no meat) which also had the strange black eyed peas and some cheese sprinkled on them.  So unfortunate the food was a flop. Bland.  She didn't come back to check on us very often and we noticed two other tables complaining from the same issue, different server.  Seems like they were understaffed and it impacted the service in a BAD way.    It's unfortunate we didn't like it here because we were excited about the new location and the cool new look.  We left saying we wouldn't come back.  Hopefully after a while of being back up and running they will get things going a bit better, I'm not opposed to giving it another shot."}
{"text":"Horrible service;( the food was good , but the waitress was rude\"Brenda\" and they messed up the order the manager was kind ....."}
{"text":"Great place for a Sunday Funday! Went there today and had a few margaritas and the steak fajitas. Excellent service and great drinks. Totally love the vibe here on a Sunday. Miranda is the greatest ;) She was our server and was totally awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"We are here now. It's been 30 minutes. Not even a hello from a server. She said shed be right over and haven't seen her since."}
{"text":"Good food and great environment. Love the veggie bowl. Maybe just add a few more grilled veggies less rice"}
{"text":"Salsa is good and nice thin crisp chips.  Asked for a flight of tequilas and the barmaid and manager stared at the collection like a dog watching tv.  Barman #2 had a slight clue, but basically, they don't know their 51 (closer to 40) tequilas.  Sangrita lame.  Not coming back."}
{"text":"Booked a reservation for my graduation and received a phone call after confirming the reservation telling me that they \"over committed\" themselves to other events.  Not acceptable and I will be sure to tell everyone to not bother with this place.  Food is so so and overpriced anyways..  Why would you not check before taking a reservation.  Completely unacceptable.."}
{"text":"Ordered a drink and was shamelessly shaken down for a tip by a bartender for an eight dollar tip on an 12 dollar order. Short pours on drinks compounded the regrettable experience. Avoid at all costs. Total ripoff"}
{"text":"First timer here.  Sat at bar around 2pm since it was just me. Brittani (sp?) was quick in greeting as she was working the other side of the bar.  The barback meanwhile was chatting on the side with another server.  He came to ask if I had been taken care of right as she was coming over to take my order.   The meal was delivered promptly.  It was hot, eye appealing,and delicious - the fish tacos. Throughout Brittani continued working the bar and had time to ask if everything was alright.  Server who dropped the entree of didn't say a peep.  Usually a \"may I get you anything else\" would follow delivery.    The two other bartenders who arrived later, Mallory and Nicole, were just as attentive and friendly.   Overall, I'll be returning and recommending."}
{"text":"A great place for nice weather! Decent happy hour (kinda wish the Mexican beer was included). Try the Big Crisp! Kinda like a Mexican flatbread thing. Loved it. On happy hour it'll feed 2 for $5. Service was great, love the atmosphere. Check it out."}
{"text":"the place has changed , last night i ordered the fish bowl , margrita with a corona in it , when it arrived no corona , waitress said well um we just pour the corona in the margarita now , when i pressed her she said well the bar tender messed up and just poured the beer in , i ask if she thought that was ok , not much of a responce , i said just take it back , had chips and fundito , nice as allways , ordered 6 pack of tacos , a couple were what we ordered a couple not so much , mentioned it to waitress , not much of a responce , ive talked to the manager several times before when hes come by the table , nice guy , after the drink order mix up i had ask to have the manager come by , we were there about an hour and a half , never seen him , i like the place but there are alot of choices around"}
{"text":"Worst service. I would think that because of the new restaurant you would increase service. But nope service was slowwww. Took about 15 min till we even got water. We just got our drinks and didn't get anything else. Plus the people around us were soo loud and obnoxious it was horrible"}
{"text":"I'd give this place no stars if I could. From the service to the food.  We came in on a Sunday afternoon, so all the day drinking crowd had already left so there weren't that many people in the restaurant.  We get seated and order drinks on their happy hour special.  The margarita had zero taste and we couldn't even get our waitress to take it back for us, we had to go up to the bartender and ask him to make a new one.  How inconvenient is that?  So then we order our food and once we get it, our waitress never came back to see how we were doing, nothing!  We had to track down a different waitress to pay our bill.  I'll never go back to this place."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative mark I would!  Stagnant water in front \"pond\".  Dead  Tv's are not on and we wanted to watch football.  Kitchen isn't open  Salsa is not good  Dirty   Smells like sewer by the bar  I will never come back"}
{"text":"Felt a bit unclean but service was good and drinks and food were fine."}
{"text":"A fun outdoor environment with a shabby surf shack atmosphere. When I first walked in the place seemed kind of run down. The sprawling grounds had us meandering all around the property and no one was greeting us so I wasn't sure if we were going to get very good service.   After finding a table out of the wind a server greeted us and gave us a menu. We ordered beer, nachos and a fried ice cream. I wasn't expecting much, but it was all very good.   The setting was very pleasant with a view of a baseball field. Kids were playing volleyball and someone brought their dog. The music volume level was acceptable for the outdoor setting.   The padded bar stool seating was very comfortable. This place would be good for groups of sports fans. A great outdoor place during our nice spring weather."}
