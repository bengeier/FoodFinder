{"text":"I've been coming here to see Mikey and his family for over three years. We've relaxed on the patio in the summer months, cozied up in the function room for a birthday party, stopped for amaretto coffee's and dessert in the evening, and had far too much wine at lunch on numerous occasions.  The atmosphere is delightfully Italian, very warm and inviting. The servers are knowledgeable and authentic, and the meals... gorgeous Italian delicacies, always fresh fresh fresh :)  MIkey, along with his family & staff (hard to tell the difference) have been here for years, their recipe for success being top-shelf hospitality and fantastic food.  In the summer the patio is always packed, and around Christmas you won't get a table without a reservation. Like I always say, save room for dessert! Undoubtedly the best Tiramisu in the city. Salute! KLM"}
{"text":"I love work functions!  They allow you to go to a nice, up-scale restaurant that you wouldn't normally take yourself too.  Il Giardino is a beautiful little Italian restaurant on the corner of 17th Ave and 4th Street SW.  It's got a lovely bistro-style feel to it, with an authentic Italian feel.  The interior of the place is nicely decorated with red, green and gold.  The mood is very sensual and gives off a romantic vibe.  I would say it's a great date idea.  Hint, hint, boyfriends!  Since we were having a work party, and there were at least 15 of us there, the wine was provided by the restaurant, which was a nice change.  We were served quickly and at the perfect times.  As soon as everyone was finished the first course, they cleared the table and served the next one.  It was like we were the only people in the place, or at least we were the most important.  The prices might be a little high at this place, but what do you expect from a classy restaurant?  I think it's worth it to have a nice meal with someone you care about.  Il Giardino definitely provides a good time, with good food and good ambiance."}
{"text":"Il Giardino (The Garden) is a real Italian restaurant. In any sense - from the owners' Ferrari parked in front, to the family photos and waiters that look and act in a perfectly Italian way.  Good food. Not mind-blowing, but definitely belly-filling. Good ambient, nice for a dinner with your best half. Or you can bring the kids or in-laws there, that would be all right.  Pricey... to the point. In Mercato I am paying for nothing special. In Giardino I am paying for a decent environment and an authentic, real food.  Now if you are more accustomed to the \"american-Italian\" way of things, that mural on the wall would probably not impress you, and you may miss many other cute and authentic details. That's ok, just keep in mind that Giardino is what Italian restaurants are in the real life, not in the movies or shopping malls. If you like the real stuff, you will enjoy the Giardino. If you don't, that's ok, too."}
