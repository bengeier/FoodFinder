{"text":"The spicy chicken sandwich was my first one I've had here. Pretty safe to say it won't be my last."}
{"text":"Love it! Best chcken sandwich! Every other days lunch for 2 years studies in Montreal! 
moved from Montreal but everytime visiting the city, bringing home at least 2 sandwiches"}
{"text":"First time here. Ordered filet mignon sandwich and chicken rice plate; request for spicy. Excellent taste with great flavours. When lining up, make a final decision on your order as its a busy place. Try also the Uludag drink (orange flavour)"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. I always get their spicy chicken sandwich for $7(including tax) Very flavourful and tender chicken."}
{"text":"I waited a while because there were three people with the same name as me and someone took my spicy chicken sandwich... And I STILL give them 5 stars because it was just that good!!"}
{"text":"I wish I had more stars to give this place. I've been eating here once or twice a week (except when they go on vacation for like a month and a half in the summer) since they opened 8-9 years ago. Everything is made fresh from scratch every day. The homemade bread is amazing. I highly recommend the chicken and the \"Antep Kebab\" meat. I love their yogurt/cucumber and spicy roasted pepper sauces. Best sandwiches in the neighbourhood. The couple that runs the place is super sweet and greets me by name. Call ahead to eat in or pick up if you're coming at lunch time, these guys get busy."}
{"text":"A smallish, out-of-the-way joint. It has fairly adequate seating, and a few small tables outside, so there should be places to sit. It can get slightly noisy, but it's a fitting atmosphere. It's decently clean and not too crowded so you can sit and eat if you'd like, or you can take your food to go.

The staff is fairly friendly and fast. The wait is a little longer than you would expect, but it's worth it.

Prices are cheap for Montreal. 6$ for the normal kebab, 8$ for the filet mignon (think kebab-flavoured beef cubes), and 10$ for the lamb. They have platters too, but those cost more.

Now the food. The portion size is a tad on the smaller side, but it's delicious. All the sandwiches are on toasted sesame bread. It's warm, slightly crispy, but still quite soft and fluffy. It's wonderfully flavourful, with a nice nutty, roasted taste. The sandwich itself has lettuce, which is mainly for texture as opposed to flavour. The meats themselves are tender and juicy, spiced in a typical kebab fashion. More on the spicy side and not as salty, but still heavenly.

It's definitely worth a try if you're anywhere near the area."}
{"text":"Superb chicken sandwich and amazing freshly made bread. If you are around, you must come by and give it a try."}
{"text":"here's the run-down - Atmosphere, Service, & Food

Atmosphere: Antep Kabab - for all of Montreal's diverse culinary fabric - is one of the few Turkish restaurants found in down-town.  The fact that it's owner operated, gives it its unique feel - what the feel is, however is yet to be clearly determined.  It's small, but cozy, quite but bustling, uniquely Turkish but feel like any number of places around the Concordia Campus.  Best is to pop in for take out.

Service: The lady behind the counter - always on her laptop pc - has a jovial smile, but can be stern if the mood doesn't strike her.  The owner, a short, burly man is the head cook (also makes the bread / pitas) speaks english with difficulty and although always happy to take customer's orders - can often been seen barking remarks / order as the 2 other employes on the counter lady.  Cute family-ish dynamic - but sometimes gives patrons an awkward feeling.

Food:  The food however, is something else!  The fact that everything is made fresh, makes Antep's menu a treasured prize for the hungry student, traveller, err... everybody.  Prices have been on the rise (damn you inflation!) and Antep's sandwiches (kabab, shish taouk (chicken portions), kebab, and filet mignon) have gone up in price to $6 each.  Two of them should do the trick when you're hungry.  Everything is cooked on a charcoal grill & as an added bonus you can find many exotic soft drinks and juices at Antep (those from the Mediterranean part of Europe and the Middle East will recognize many of them).  Take note, only cash is accepted.

\"Baten Malan, Kef Tamam\" (full stomach, happy mind)"}
{"text":"Searching for a cheap bite late on a Monday evening, I stopped in at Antep Kebab after reading other good reviews here.  I was certainly not disappointed!  The chicken sandwich is stuffed with perfectly-done chicken, and they asked me how spicy I'd like it, too.  Lovely bread, quick service, good price -- this is a place I'll recommend to friends!"}
{"text":"AMAZIINNGGGG!!!!!
The Meat is great,
the staff is polite

The best turkish food in Montreal"}
{"text":"So good.  One of the best values in town.  I love lamb and they do it amazingly here.  The best value is to get a chicken sandwich for only 6 dollars! They put tomatoes, cucumbers and tzatziki with your choice of meat.  Everything is done in house from the amazing bread to the freshly grilled meats.  I try and come here for lunch since my work is so close as many times as I can.

The platters are also really good just a bit more expensive because its much more food.  

The place at first seems like a hodge podge of furniture and a hole in the wall, but it is really really good.  You won't be disappointed!

It does take awhile to prepare so call ahead!"}
{"text":"Best Turkish grilled sandwiches in town ....
Amazing food for a cheep price .
Very tasty and delicious .
Be careful it is very addictive ..."}
{"text":"A hidden gem that u walk by and might not realize what you're missing.. Love their bread pockets with fillet mignon and kabab.."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food. I really their spicy chicken sandwich in their home made turkish bread. Prices and portions are really good. Serive is so so"}
{"text":"delicious fresh grilled meats with that great grill flavour. 

fresh salad dressed with oil and lemon

amazing barley with tomato base 

fresh baked bread

firm, tart, fresh yogurt

light chili sauce

Good selection of canned/bottled non-alcoholic drinks

amazing place

easily one of the best mediterranean/middle eastern places in Montreal."}
{"text":"Turkish style chicken and meat...very fresh and delicious...restaurant is very clean...I got the chicken plate which they serve with barley, salad, tzatziki, bread and hot sauce, the bread they make it themselves and it's awesome. My plate was very filling I could only finish half...highly recommended restaurant if you like Turkish food."}
{"text":"I had one of the lamb sandwiches. It was pretty good. The service was very slow"}
{"text":"Meat and bread cooked to order. Spicy chicken sandwich was mouthwatering and tasty. Kabob plate was also good. Unfortunately one person in our party got a bad case of food poisoning. Not sure if we would go back again."}
{"text":"I went there last week, had the kafta-kebab sandwich and it was absolutely STELLAR, good bread and nice, spicy meat. The decor is whatever but for very good, spicy kebab, this is seriously excellent. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Good quality.  I like the chicken sandwich. They cook the bread themselves in place .  It is really fresh.  Affordable. Good option for students.  It is better to order in advance cuz it takes about 15 min to get ready."}
{"text":"This place doesnt quite standout when you're just walking by but let me tell you - walk in , now .. no like right now!

Their chicken and beef sandwiches are delicious , everything from the meat itself to the sauce inside is great. The big star is the freshly made bread. Drool inducing! 

Now if you have a bit of an appetite their plates are delicious. Everything on the plate is well thought out and complimentary to each other. 

I dont know how Turkish the food is or not but regardless it is mouth watering delicious food!

Only con is that they are a bit slow since they cook everything fresh on a charcoal grill but dont let that deter you (maybe call in advance if you're in a hurry). Big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"a friend of mine recommended this Turkish restaurant to me. I am not big on grilled meat in general. It just happened I was in area so I decided to check it out for a late lunch. I ordered a chicken sandwich which comes in. Freshly baked Turkish bread. The chicken was yum and I really liked the bread so much.  The portion was huge so I could not finish it. I paid about $6 for it and it was totally worth it. 

I also liked the fact the restaurant looked very clean on the inside. They have an open kitchen concept so i got to see how my sandwich was prepared which is nice. I am highly skeptical when it comes to those little fast food restaurants but Antep Kebab gets thumps up. I would go back again especially for the bread."}
{"text":"Fresh and fragrant sesame bread smeared with labneh, roasted lamb that's both juicy and crispy. Probably the best hot sandwich you can find in the area, despite its price tag, the wait time and the fact they only accept cash"}
{"text":"Really great meats, and barley. Yummmm The Barley! so good. Great salad as well as yogurt with spicy sauce. I think I like the minced meat the most."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich that I had was perfect.. The only reason I'm not rating it 5 * is because it took them 15 minutes to prepare it and the atmosphere was not that good. Taste wise though, perfect"}
{"text":"went to have quick lunch with my friends.

fresh homemade bread(cook after order), fresh fried meat(cook after order), perfect seasoning, good burnt smell inside restaurant, energetic staff and quick service.

i tasted chicken/lamb sandwiches so far and both were so delicious. price was good too, you need to pay cash though. I'm still wondering how and when to enjoy that salty yogurt drink..."}
{"text":"Trop bon! Cela me rappelle les kebabs de mon enfance. La viande est excellente. J'ai choisi le sandwich épicé à l'agneau."}
{"text":"This place literally has the best chicken sandwich I've ever tasted.

The chicken itself is moist, charred, and flavourful, and really stands out as the star of this establishment in my opinion. Their bread is baked fresh and is just awesome. 

It's sort of a small place so it might get kind of crowded if you're planning on eating there. Take a sandwich (or 2!) to go - trust me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Overall a great Armenian fast food type of restaurant.   The cashier was extremely helpful concerning our lack of knowledge in both Armenian sandwiches and the French language. She suggested turnips as one of our vegetable add-ons and it made it much better than the standard Greek gyro. Also, free Wi-Fi for all customers was available. What a blessing for us tourists!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place rocks. For only $6 I got a freshly made grilled chicken sandwich, it was yummy. They even bake their own bread, it is a round Turkish bread that make this restaurant really unique. Excellent value"}
{"text":"Antep serves the best sandwiches in Montreal, and if you're disagree you're wrong.

I could eat these sandwiches all day  errday, son.

You better tell somebody."}
{"text":"Woow,where to start. The second I got in the smell got me drewling,damee. Really decent prize for the big amount of amazing Sandwhich. I ordered the anteb kabab and the chicken nothing bad to say ,clean, cozy and really nice people felt like fam. Amazing highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I know of only 2 places that make fast food turkishstyle and this is the best one.
I honestly believe it's the best quick bite in the downtown area.

Pros:  Amazing bread, kebab, chicken and filet mignon, the salad is always fresh and complements the meal quite nicely. I cannot stress how delicious the meats are and the breads are also a delight.

Cons: Lamb is pricey ($10 for sandwich and $20 for plate.
The side of bulgur is not good and cold mush (no rice or fries to substitute). 
Last issue is you only get half a bread for a plate even though it's twice the price of a sandwich. So better to take 2 sandwiches with 2 yummy breads.

The interior decorating is lifted out of a failed nightclub and the uneven tables seem to wobble a bit, but who cares.

The service is also pretty friendly, but you have to give them a few minutes to make the food. This is not a standard shish taouk joint."}
{"text":"It was neat to see the fresh bread being made.  I had the filet mignon sandwich with spicy sauce.  It was slightly overcooked.  My boyfriend had the chicken with spicy sauce.  They were decent sandwiches but they could have used a bit more seasoning.  They forgot about us so we had to wait longer than usual."}
{"text":"I love this joint. Freshly made bread, freshly grilled meats. They don't bother with questionable meat on a spit spinning round all day, this s--t is tight.

Sandwiches are pricey in that they start at $7, but they're are an entire meal by themselves. Plates start at about $14, and could easily be shared by two."}
{"text":"Do me a favor and get the 'Antep sandwich,' priced at $6.

Absolutely fantastic; beautifully seasoned and perfectly grilled boneless lamb kebab, served in a country Turkish-style freshly-baked bun, with a light smattering of tomato, parsley, and sesame/garlic sauce.

Cooked to order-doesn't get much better than this."}
{"text":"Amazing value for $6 (tax included). Sandwich is super fresh and comes with a generous amount of meat hot off the grill."}
{"text":"Awesome kabob sandwiches that they make using their fresh baked breads. Probably my favorite part was the fresh bread. The meats were also very good. You can watch them freshly cooking all the meats over the wood coal stove. Simply  delicious.  A must if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Sooo good! Their freshly made bread is the perfect pocket for their sandwiches. Have tried both the spicy chicken sandwich and the chicken plate. Both were amazing, the chicken is juicy and grilled to perfection with that amazing charcoal taste. My only complaint with the plate is the haphazard salad, literally some iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers, dry with no dressing. That with the fact that the eat-in area is very dirty and poorly maintained is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"The good:
Very friendly and warm service
Lamb has great flavor
Bread is fluffy and warm and amazing

The bad:
Lamb was super fatty.  I had to remove half of the meat because it was all gristle and uck.  From all the other positive reviews I'm guessing I just got the blubbery ends, but it's the blubbery ends I got, so else can I review?"}
{"text":"I just picked up my first order at Antep Kabab. They are super friendly there and quicker than I thought they would be (after reading other reviews). The bread is definitely the best part- fluffy and fresh with a slightly charred outside. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich that I think might have turned out to be a normal chicken sandwich. The chicken is delicious and succulent- very different from a normal shawarma since these are cubed and cooked separately. Overall, the sandwich is nice- it was $7CAD cash and fast. Not bad but could use a bit more seasoning or spice."}
{"text":"PROS:

1. Spicy Chicken Sandwich is to die for ! ! ! The bread is made in house and has sesame seeds which adds really great flavor to the smokey chicken with tzatziki/veg. So goooooood....

2. Quick. Cheap.

CONS:
1. Food is too good to see a con.

OVERALL:
-Go, you will not regret it!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick meal. I always get their spicy chicken sandwich, and it is always sooo good (and only for $7)! Fresh bread and very tasty grilled chicken - loved it. I'll try the lamb and ground meat next time."}
{"text":"Every thing being equal the bread is worth ten times the price of the meal. I had the filet minion kebab and it was great but I would have traded half the filet for another piece of bread. It's that good."}
{"text":"LOOVE the spicy chicken sandwich here.  I call in 15 min before I come otherwise you wait 15+ min. I haven't tried the filet mignon bc I always crave the chicken. The buns are sooo good that I take a bite of my hubby's buns when he is not looking.  That's how good it is mm ya!  It taste doughy n fresh just how I like it =) Best Turkish sandwich and buns I ever had!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Sandwich style lamb (antep kebab) and filet mignon sandwich hit the spot and were incredibly tasty! Only downside was they are cash only but there is an ar"}
{"text":"This was a different Turkish sandwich for me. Bread was so fresh and meat was just grilled. I could smell that smokey smell from the chicken . Very cheap and tasty quick bite. They take only cash though so make sure to carry some before you go in."}
{"text":"The chicken sandwich was pretty good and juicy but lacking in some flavor. The bread was very fresh and soft. The chicken platter was not too bad. The sauces were okay."}
{"text":"Its a good place. The filet mignon sandwich was vert tasty, with fresh vegetables and sauce. 
I recommand."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch if you are downtown. I always get the chicken sandwich for $7 cad. They freshly make the bread. They freshly grill the chicken which has a great flavor to it and you know it's fresh because they get so much turnover.  The bread and the chicken make it a great sandwich. The veggies and sauce they use is okay. 

One negative is that it can get busy during lunch (students, workers). You could be waiting 10minutes for your sandwich depending on how much grilling they are doing. 

No paper menus. Everything is on board above

The chicken sandwich is a must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is small and not particularly interesting from the outside, the décor and seating is basic but you will always see a lot of rush inside. 
We were passing by and could smell a delicious chargrilled aroma coming from somewhere... the smell led us to Antep and before we know it, we left hands-full of sandwiches. 

There are only a few items on the menu - either meat/chicken sandwiches or meat/chicken plates. I highly recommend the sandwiches, mainly because the Turkish bun is freshly-made in store. You can see the girl putting in and taking out fresh-batches like clockwork.

I had a spicy filet-mignon sandwich (which I waited nearly 45 minutes for - was there during peak lunch-time) and watched the entire process of how it was made. The fresh bread came out of the oven, a dollop of garlic sauce and a special home-made chilli sauce were spread inside, a heaping of salad was placed along with an entire skewer of juicy filet mignon. Biting into this thing was tricky as the sandwich is super filled and heavy - which I totally didn't mind! You definitely get your money's worth of meat (the sandwiches are a tad on the pricier side!)
The flavours are to perfection, almost addictive as you want more afterwards. Great place for lunch/dinner if you want to try authentic Turkish flavours!"}
{"text":"The menu is very simple but very tasty.I like the fact that the bread is made on location.It takes a bit of time to get the food but that is as a result that it is made fresh"}
{"text":"Although a bit dingy on the inside, Antep Kabab still delivers a respectable enough spicy chicken sandwich, even though it's not really \"spicy\" at all. All of the spicy sauce tended to conglomerate toward the bottom, so it was quite uneven in terms of what to expect. The bread tasted very nice though and it was cool to see it being baked right in front of me! I just wish that the sandwich overall had a bit more to it.

From multiple Turkish friends, I wouldn't say this is the most authentic Turkish place as normally the kebabs should be nicer/higher quality? But I could definitely see this being a nice sort of drunk food if you're partying in the Concordia area."}
{"text":"Go for the spicy chicken sandwich, simply delicious.

Freshly baked bread and charcoaled grilled halal chicken...simplicity at its finest."}
{"text":"Got lamb platter and spicy chicken sandwich... there is a reason why everyone raves about the spicy chicken sandwich... it's just so so so perfect!  I took a bite of it and wish I could have a hundred more bites but it wasn't my sandwich . I had the big plate and it was very good too but just not the chicken sandwich!  

Skip the fancy brunch or lunch place and come here!  

Cash only but they have an ATM machine and only charges $1 for withdrawal... so not the end of the world if you didn't bring $."}
{"text":"Best Turkish chicken joint I've been to. Try their chicken plate if you're really hungry, and their chicken sandwich if you're just normal hungry. FYI, their buns are also baked in house."}
{"text":"Great grilled chicken sandwich! There's the option for spicy and non spicy. Order at the counter and wait for your name to be called when the sandwich is ready!  Ordered the sour cherry soda and it tastes like maraschino cherries."}
{"text":"I love the chicken spicy sandwich , it is just perfectly done !!! And the fresh bread is my weakness there love it ! Definitely recommend it however not always the chicken is juicy but when it is !! Nothing I can complain about"}
{"text":"Walked into this place and was greeted with a smile.  The owner was very friendly. I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and was not disappointed. The bread was fluffy and fresh and the sandwich was loaded with chicken. I will definitely be coming back here to try the filet mignon sandwich as well. For $6.50 the sandwich is a great deal. The combination of freshly grilled meat with fresh veggies make this sandwich mouth watering. I can't wait to get my next sandwich."}
{"text":"The filet mignon was probably one of the best meats I've ever had!  The bread used for their sandwiches was also extremely good!"}
{"text":"I'm from Jerusalem the city where's the people eat kabab 7. Times a week 
And. I'm traveler and I visited many countries in the past 3 years 
I have never eat a kabab like antep kabab hands down 
I missed Montreal because of your kabab sandwich 
This place is level advanced"}
{"text":"Food was good, though I wasn't impressed with the quality of the lamb. The guy operating the cash register was a huge jerk (maybe because I'm a foreigner?) and he rounded down my change to the nearest dollar... Atmosphere was fine, nothing special. It's not super cheap either, about $10 for a sandwich. Go for it if you're a sandwich/kebab fan, otherwise try something else."}
{"text":"Kabab burger place... found on yelp while I was in the area... It's interesting... Kind of pricy though but its good so its worth!

I had a chicken burger..the bread tasted fresh or home made and the meat was very tender and juicy. But I don't like the way the salad and meat are placed... They put in the veggie then meat afterwards so when you eat you eat either meat first (usually because its on the opening of the bread) then veggie afterward...

Overall its something to try and grab when your in the area!"}
{"text":"I had a lamb sandwich. I think it could better if coming with more spices or more marinated. 10 dollar per a sandwich only. I think the price is OK but I may find a better place with more choices."}
{"text":"Délicieuses sandwichs et plats, j'ai pris le plat de poulet, une autre fois la sandwich, un régal."}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch. Took about 5 mins to get my food. I got the spicy kabob sandwich and a can soda for $7 dollars. The owner took US since I had no Canadian. They don't take Visa card. Food was fresh and good on soft fresh baked bread. The portion was just enough for lunch. Good place to eat."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and I had the spicy kebab sandwich. The meat very tasty and the bread was the best part; it is homemade right in front of you. The staff was really polite and friendly. My friend took the chicken sandwich and she like it as well. Would recommend to anyone who is really hungry, because the portions are quite big."}
{"text":"Delicious Turkish style kebabs and great location! 
This is perhaps the only Turkish restaurant in Montreal that makes real Turkish food! If you ever go to places like \"Su\", they are overpriced and fake! 

Antep Kebab cooks on a grill and makes a good kebab. 
It is also very popular so it takes a good 20 minutes to get your food. There is also pick up and Turkish soft drinks."}
{"text":"Ermahgerd! I got the Antep sandwich and lost my mind. It's so smokey and delicious. The meat melted in my mouth. The tatsziki is creamy with just the right amount of dill. You guys, this is a sandwich epiphany.  Please go here immediately. You will be soooooo happy.

Side note: you're gonna want to give yourself a day to recover. It's pretty heavy."}
{"text":"Best turkish kabab in downtown MTL. 
However, they take only cash and recently ramped up prices. Sketchy behavior in that aspect. 

Good place for a takeout. 
Kebab quality is actually good."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant passant inapercu mais qui vaut la peine de faire un arret. Décoration sympa pour un fastfood. Leur sandwich au poulet est très savoureux. J'en mangerais à tous les jours."}
{"text":"I like the bread. The grilled meat is also delicious. I think I will try chicken kebab next time."}
{"text":"Must-taste Turkish joint in Montreal! Highly recommend their chicken platter and Chicken sandwich. Freshly baked bread and charcoaled grilled chicken makes it just delicious. Add extra yogurt to your sandwich. I also prefer the sandwich to be spicy. They only accept cash though! Chicken Sandwich is $7.50 and Platter is $15 !"}
{"text":"This place offers delicious plates. Every time I go back, I enjoy the plate as if new. 

I recommend it without reservation and will surely come back.

The tables are simple and cosy. They still lack a good table service. Yet, their model does not offer a service a la table. It would be great to have it though."}
{"text":"I had no expectations when I first walked through the door. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and boy, the chicken really had the charcoal grilled flavour. The sandwich itself, however, was ok. It contained too much mayonnaise/cheese (fats) and it became a mess cuz the bread fell apart. And we could barely taste the spiciness. But for 6.50$, I'd still take that over a burger at Mcdonalds any day of the week."}
