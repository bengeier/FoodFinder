{"text":"Been to old location too and the food is good but just not worth the wait.  Waited for over an hour for our food, no one came to refill drinks,  said something to owner but  she didnt do much and spent time telling us why we had to wait so long.  Food was cold and they need to hire more staff, buysboys, waiter, ect."}
{"text":"Great imported beer menu. Lots of bottles you can't get elsewhere -- Polish ImperialStout, Baltika #4, Lithuanian beer.  Great service and delicious food.  Quite a mix from German to Polish to Scandinavian, but they make it work."}
{"text":"We have been frequenting Beaver Choice since shortly after they opened in Tempe, and especially love the design, decor, food and service at the beautiful new location in Mesa. Had dinner there last night to celebrate a birthday, and had my favorite seared gravlax (rare, of course) which is among my 10 favorite foods I have ever eaten. Also relished the side salads of cole slaw and green/spinach salad, and the vinaigrette potato salad. Our celebration was topped off with Beaver Supreme, one of their signature desserts, which we enjoyed immensely. We have always been welcomed & served graciously by the Beaver Choice family."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is terrible. The female owner besides having no personality,is rude.The service spoils the whole dining experience.I'll go back at a later date, but it's going to take awhile for the bad experience to leave my mind."}
{"text":"We do an \"ethnic dinner\" every other month and this month it was my turn. I am SO glad that I picked Beaver Choice because it was fabulous.

The place itself is tiny and food is ordered from the front counter. The kid that was taking orders was very helpful and a real sweetheart. The wait time is considerable, but as long as you aren't in a hurry, the food is worth the wait.

I ordered the Laxpudding with sides of broccoli, home made coleslaw, and dill potatoes. My friend ordered the Swedish meatballs.

I'm not sure what I actually received since it doesn't seem to match the description of Laxpudding from their menu. I think what I actually received was the Salmonburger & Skagenrora. It was very good, but I'm not really a salmonburger kind of girl. The topping on it was fantastic though! 

The broccoli was delicious and perfectly cooked. The dill potatoes were also very good and holy cannoli, they are seriously DILL. If you like dill, try these potatoes.

My friend raved about the Swedish meatballs - even scrapping the plate with her fork to try to get any of the remnants. She said they were better than Ikea which since I've never tried them and she says they are great, I'm going to assume this is a high compliment to Beaver Choice's meatballs.

I got a Beaver Ball to go based on reviews on Yelp mentioning them. They were super chocolaty - I think dark chocolate? My husband swears there was coconut in them which he didn't like... I didn't notice coconut, but that doesn't mean anything.

I can't wait to go back to try other things on their menu... especially the Schnitzel which is what they are known for. Delicious food and excellent, warm service. Great place!!"}
{"text":"I was compelled by other Yelp reviewers to check this place out, and now my only regret is not having tried it sooner! They have two menus, A \"Grab-n-Go\" menu and a \"Bistro\" menu. The G-n-G menu is smaller, less expensive, and has more traditional American dishes (although not limited to by ANY means) whereas the Bistro menu looks more like traditional Swedish cuisine. Ordering from the G-n-G menu, I tried the Swedish Cured Salmon Sandwich and an order of poutine. Both were incredible, the sandwich was a very generous portion with plenty of fish on it, yet it did not taste too fishy and was perfectly balanced! The family that owns the place each contributed to the ordering, preparation, and payment for the food which I found amusing, and they were so nice! They have a newspaper cutout from Arizona Central's review of their place (a glowing review, by the way) where the reviewer states that they could give friendliness lessons to Golden Retriever puppies, and I have to agree! You can even watch the food being made through the open door/window and it is very obviously homemade from scratch. Friendly service, delicious food, and ridiculously modest prices. Do yourself a favor and try this gem for yourself! You can even bring your own beer (2 bottles max) or wine (1 bottle max)!!!"}
{"text":"First time at the new location--been to the previous several times before.  What a contrast between the two locations.  The new one is so much larger and has a bar.

Our party of five arrived 45 minutes prior to closing.  We were merrily greeted, seated, and had our drink orders taken,  After exploring the menu we ordered the Polish Sampler, Stuffed Chicken, Pork Cordon Bleu, and Pork Jager Schnitzel.    We were all happy with our dishes and shared tastes with each other.  The plates were clean at the end.  We stayed nearly 30 minutes past closing yet the staff continued to be gracious and courteous.  As we left the owner stopped us and chatted as well as checking to see if we enjoyed our meal.

Going to Beaver Choice is like going to a relatives place to eat.  The staff treats us like family.  And the food portions are very generous.  Bring your appetite and enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly (albeit slow) service. I had the regular chicken schnitzel and it was wonderful (wunderbar)!  I highly recommend their schnitzel!  Large portion sizes and great selection of imported beers as well.  Gave it a four because each step of the process took longer than expected but it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Although the wait is a bit long to get your food ... the servers have been super nice, and the food is TOTALLY worth the wait!  It's our first time here, but our son and his wife have been here a few times.  I had the Holsteiner  Schnitzel and my husband the elk stew - both were DELICIOUS!!  Our son had the gravalax and his wife the pork schnitzel, and both of those were delicious as well.  The sides are very authentic.  We're waiting for our dessert, which I'm sure will also be great.  Absolutely will return on one of our next trips to visit the new grandson!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Finally made it over to the new location, and things have only improved from before. The food is still amazing, home cooked and delicious. You can tell that a lot of time and care has been put into the dishes. I've never been disappointed in anything I've ordered. The menu warns two particular dishes can take 45 minutes to prepare (Flying Jacob and Fish Bake in Caviar Sauce), but they are worth every minute of the wait. The prices, too, are even less than I'd expect to pay for such quality of food.

The new location brings a much larger dining space, and a liquor license. They have a unique selection of eastern European beers that you don't get to try just anywhere. We tried three different Polish beers and they were all quite tasty.

This place still maintains its personal touch. Hanna and her family (the owners) were still on site, circulating the dining room, talking to customers, answering a few of our questions about the origins of the dishes. You can tell how proud they are of their cuisine. I wish I lived closer so I could stop by more frequently!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The family was so friendly and the food was AMAZING!!! and I just saw them on the FoodNetwork Channel.
A+ All the way......."}
{"text":"We stopped by based on Yelp reviews about a month ago. We loved this place, it's got a real great feel, from the friendly staff who are passionate about their food and explain the process, offer samples to the fact that they clearly are swedes. The food was excellent. Our entrees did not come out together, but the staff explained that they bring the food out as it's ready, and since they do as much as possible from scratch, the dishes have different preparation time. Having all the food at the same time is nice, but I'll take this authentic style over heat and serve mass productions.
The food and staff rate 5 stars. The only downsides to me, were the Ikea-style plastic furniture and coffee in styrofoam cups - a little investment on both would make this an absolute solid five-star bistro!"}
{"text":"Well, I had an experience very similar to reviewer Kelly C.'s. In a nutshell, the food was a joke, service was spotty, menu was inconsistent and the owner was a douche.

Here's the long story:

The wife and I drove by this place a week ago and were intrigued by the name and the Scandinavian cuisine, so we decided we'd go. We looked online at the menu choices, things seemed interesting but we didn't memorize it or anything. Well, we should have, as their table menus (printed on regular 8.5x11 paper) had very little description of all the oddly-named Scandinavian dishes; so, we had to trouble the waitress to describe them.

After all that, we ordered. I got some weird-named dish which was basically shepherd's pie and the wife ordered gravlax (kinda like salmon sheets). After ordering, I had forgotten if I had asked the waitress for the beef in my pie (the other choice is pork) so I got up and chased her down. She told me \"No problem, the kitchen's running behind so yours hasn't been started yet and I'll tell them.\" Well, as you probably guessed I was served the one with pork despite waiting 30+ minutes for it to come out. Not only that, they gave us the wrong sides so I had to wait while the poor waitress went to the back to get the correct ones to even tell her of the pork deal.

I'm not some baby who can't eat pork, I simply ordered beef and wanted beef. When she got back, she apologized and picked up the plate and went to the owner to ask what to do. Said owner had been schmoozing people who were clearly the \"bottle wine buying type\" the entire time we were there. I saw her whisper in the waitress's ear, and the waitress came back and said \"I'm sorry, this is my fault but we're out of beef for this dish today and I should have told you that. I'll buy you dessert of your choice.\" Well, that's great and I'm glad the waitress was nice but I don't think that is her responsibility. I also don't buy that they were out of beef; could be wrong, but come on. By this time, I was impatient and hungry so I just said \"Okay\" and ate my food.

To the food: More B.S. Not only did I get pork I didn't order, but the insult was that it was just some school cafeteria-like boneless fatless pork patty. You'd think some real scandinavian kitchen would have some kind of slow-cooked, fat dripping off delicious pork. The gravlax, which we were told was given some kind of salt dry rub had absolutely no flavor. It was just raw salmon, big deal. The only highlight here was the fermented sides like the beet and horseradish and the sauerkraut, but for a pork patty smothered with boring mashed potatoes and a weak plate of gravlax we still paid almost 50 bucks and that's *with* the free dessert (which was apparently pretty good, according to my wife- it was the citron fromage)

The owner is apparently Polish, so on that note I'm not sure what qualifies her to make a Scandinavian/Canadian restaurant; but I guess the results of this visit show that she is not qualified. Save the trip here, you can make most of this stuff at home way easier and much more cheaply with better ingredients."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, Beavers frolicked along the Salt River that flowed through, what would become, the city of Tempe - then, with the construction of Roosevelt Dam, they disappeared along with the river...

Now, 100 hundred years later, the Beaver has returned!!! (and this time he is holding a knife, fork, and wearing a little shirt - according to the logo - apparently he's not out for revenge - but he does look pretty intense).  

Had my second Beaver Choice adventure this afternoon.  My timing was perfect, shockingly I was the only one there (briefly) - so I had a chance to talk with the owners and they even shared part of their lunch with me, what!  

I was on a mission to try the Flying Jacob which is a chicken, peanut, chili, cream, and... banana dish that is apparently extremely popular in Sweden.  It reminded me of a sweet Thai curry - worked well with the dill mashed potatoes - pretty tasty!!

Just to back up briefly, I had the hash previously on the first go - thought this was excellent too - man, you will not leave hungry...  You can tell these dishes were intended for people who had to trudge through Arctic environments, they definitely stick to your bones...  

So, until Roosevelt Dam crumbles, Tempe Marketplace washes away, and the 'real' beavers return - I'd seriously check out the new immigrant Beaver in town... Beaver Choice!"}
{"text":"I used to watch New Scandinavian Cooking on PBS just for the girl in the pigtails. Now, I find that I should have also been paying attention to the cooking, too! All the five star reviews are totally warranted - incredible Scandinavian dishes, friendly family service, and a low price point. Best new cheap eats place I've been to this year."}
{"text":"Food was ok but came out staggered.  Waitress was horrible.  Had to ask several times for refills .  they were out of root beer, sausage, asparagus. bartender was off duty. over all very disappointed.  Will never return--or refer anyone to come here."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The food was delicious, and the staff was extremely friendly. We came on a weeknight, and the owner was actually our server! She was so personable, told us really great stories, and explained the food choices so well. She was funny too. The beer pairing suggestions were spot on, and while we didn't order any dessert, we had food envy every time a dessert plate passed by. We are from Southern California, but would come back to Mesa in a heartbeat just to eat here again."}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is good, very unique, and the employees (family) are super friendly.  They are moving soon, early 2013 I believe.  Don't go if you're in a rush.  When you order the schnitzel you'll often hear them pounding it out in the back.  A lot of dishes take 30+ minutes but thats what good, not-premade, family crafted food takes.

My favorites are the poutine (french fries covered with gravy and cheese curds) and the rosti (omg-wtf-awesome hashbrowns).  All of the main dishes I've tried were good (cabbage rolls, schnitzel, etc)"}
{"text":"First off, the food here is super delicious! The pierogies are so yummy and the schnitzel and housemade porcini sauce is to die for. But, we have eaten there several times now and the service has been pretty crappy both times. Hence, the three stars. 

The first time was a Friday night and it was pretty busy so I gave them a pass on that. The second time was a Thursday at about 5:30 and the restaurant was only half full. We said we needed just a few minutes with the menu (literally) but the waitress didn't return for another fifteen minutes after taking the orders for two other larger parties. We had to wait about 25 minutes for our food and I noticed that people who came in after us were getting their food before us. Since it was just my husband and I it was confusing as to what was taking so long. My food came out but it was missing the sauce for my pierogies and one of my sides. We had to wait about five more minutes for my husband's food and the sauce for my meal. Then we had to ask for the missing side and that didn't come out until I had finished my food so I was full at that point. There is a lot of older clientele in the restaurant (which is fine with me) but the waitstaff definitely favors the older crowd. They really need to step up the service side of their business because even if your food is wonderful people do not want to pay to be ignored and for a meal to take close to two hours when all you ordered is one course (for two people)."}
{"text":"I never leave yelp reviews but had such a wonderful experience at beaver choice, I had to leave a review right away. The food was delicious- the Swedish meatballs and hunter schnitzel in particular. Definitely stay and make room for the crepes! Hannah the owner was incredibly friendly, sweet, and even with a packed house for a Wednesday night, was attentive and made the experience all the better. Highly highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Don't let the name fool you, this place is actually really tasty! Owned by a cute Swedish family, they offer up great food at good prices! Be sure to try the cardamon chicken!"}
{"text":"Never thought I'd encounter a hole-in-the-wall Scandinavian restaurant, but that's exactly what Beaver Choice is. Situated between a hair salon and a dollar store, this newly-opened restaurant offers up traditional Scandinavian dishes as well as pitas, wraps, burgers and salads. Everything from their gravad lax (cured salmon) to their köttbullar (better known as 'Swedish meatballs') is made from scratch. The family that owns and runs the restaurant is super friendly, and really make the place inviting. A few things to note, however. The service is not quite what you'd expect, and may catch some off guard. While they are quick to bring you anything you ask for, (extra silverware, a drink refill, etc) they will otherwise generally leave you undisturbed during your meal, as they don't wish to interrupt your dining with a lot of \"and how is everything tonight?\" and things of that nature. Same goes with the check. There's no waiter dropping it off saying \"Whenever you're ready, I'll be your cashier\". It's expected that when you feel like leaving (and there's no rush) you'll just go up to the register and pay for your meal. That said, I'm definitely going to go back again, and soon."}
{"text":"Pricey, but delicious. I ordered the elk stew and my mouth had no idea what to do with all the stunning flavors"}
{"text":"This is great when you are in the mood for something different.  As with any family-run hole in the wall, service can be slow, so be prepared.  What the staff lacked in speed, they made up for in charm and smiles.  The food was good, but nothing that wowed me.  I had the pierogis while my friend had swedish meatballs.  Both dishes were tasty, as were the side dishes.  One thing that was disappointing was that the food was a a little cold (lukewarm) when it came out.  Maybe the chef or the staff was having an off day.  The restaurant itself is bright and clean.  I will go back again when I feel like eating outside the box."}
{"text":"Ate here a few months ago, just before they moved locations. The staff was very friendly. The decor looked like the type of small family owned restaurant you find overseas; the kind where you literally eat in the families livingroom. The food reflected the same; nothing fancy or spectacular, just plain home cooking. Was a bit pricey for the quality, but an overall good experience if you want plain comfort food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food alot. It was first time trying Scandinavian fusion and it was pretty darn good. The server gave us complimentary perogies and I was hooked after that. I had one of the platters and it was great tasting and has huge portions. For what you are paying for i would consider it fair. I need to go there more often because they have a huge menu to choose from!"}
{"text":"What a little gem!  Felt adventurous for lunch and ended up at the Beaver!  Homemade Pierogi with muchroom gravy.  Swedish meatballs with lingonberry.  CUTEST family that runs this place.  Oh! and the sample plate was great and made me have the beet salad which was sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Saturday 11 AM crowd of 6 ppl

Swedish Potato Hash FTW!
We drove 40 min to try this place.
I was scared bc of the unique foods and the exterior looks,
but I had heard good things abt it.

Takes a while to make, so grab one of their games.

In our case, we brought our own.

My group played \"Cards against humanity\".
 We were ROFL and noisy while the food was being prepared.

Staff was nice, esp owner."}
{"text":"Ditto to what every one else has said; this place is definitely worth checking out (and re-visiting in my case!). 

In short, the food was great & reasonably priced too. My exposure to Scandenavian cuisine has been limited to Ikea, so it's nice to have somewhere that offers a little bit of Sweden right down the street from my house.

Even better than the food was the service. The family that runs the place is adorable & eager to please. They take care to give all patrons A+ service, and this certainly made an impression on me.

No doubt about it, I'll be returning with by friends to try the desserts (as I was too stuffed from my gigantic meal to even try and tackle the sweet treats!)"}
{"text":"This is an absolute family favorite!!  Cabbage rolls are great, and I often crave the beet salad!"}
{"text":"My husband, sister and her husband went here for dinner last night. We were very pleased with it from the moment we walked in when we were welcomed enthusiastically and told we could sit anywhere we wished.  My husband is in a wheelchair so we chose a table close to the entrance.  The waiter, I believe his name was Tim, was wonderful.  He had the patience to answer all the entrée questions we had (and with all those Swedish and Polish dishes we had plenty).  He was friendly and very attentive.  I had pierogi, and tried them fried which was a mistake - next time I will have them steamed like I am used to because the frying seemed to make them less flavorful.  My husband had the Polish plate and it was very good - I sampled all of it.  My sister and her husband both had Swedish platters and enjoyed them.  We liked the beet salad and the rosti potatoes too.  We did have dessert - shared an apple tart and it was really good.  We liked it very much and would definitely return."}
{"text":"Buying Gift Certificates for my friends from the Beaver Choice!  I just found out yesterday, they HAVE GIFT CERTIFICATES!!!  Now, I can introduce my friends to this fabulous food.  Consider yourself lucky if you are on Santa's Nice List!!!!"}
{"text":"Hope to go tonight and see the new menu and the new location.  It's going to be great and we can't wait!  Congratulations on the move to Baseline Rd in Mesa.  Tons more space.  Wishing you all much success on your next first day."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS.  Delightful family run restaurant.  Food is fantastic.  Service is great.  The only issue I had was the food was so hearty it was hard to eat my restaurant week included dessert (but it was so very tasty!).  Can't wait to go back!

The food is SO fresh, and SO wonderful.  The cheese curd in the poutine was nice and squeaky, the gravies were all so tasty.  The Pierogies are to die for."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and nice family atmosphere. The Howard Special is as good as it is reviewed, and the side dishes are great too. I really like the authenticity of this place, and the homestyle Swedish cooking."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food. The reviews are true. I would give it 5 stars but the location is not the best. Five stars for the food though. Support local! Looking forward to visiting their new location. Like their story.  Started on a food truck!  Good for you!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise. At first I was not sure what to expect from a \"Swedish\" bistro in Tempe, but I could not resist the temptation to give it a shot. On a trip down to the valley from Flagstaff, I stopped by and was amazed to find such friendly and happy Swedes in the middle of the Arizona desert hiding close to ASU in Tempe where I spent my first years in the US after moving from Sweden in 2000.  I tried one of the wraps that turned out to be just amazing. A perfect balance of very fresh crisp Swedish style vegetables with really tasty pieces of chicken and a hint of the South West, bringing back memories from Sweden and guaranteeing my return for more during my next visit to the Tempe area.  Keep up the great flavors guys.  You are very affordable too. This is a no brainer when looking for great value for money in combination with excellent food. See you again soon."}
{"text":"Flying Jacob is fantastic. The pork schnitzel cordon blue is heavenly. The stuffed chicken not bad but try something more ethnic!  Chocolate lava cake is a nice dense flourless cake. Doesn't explode with chocolate sauce but one of the best chocolate desserts out there. The beaver choice dessert is orgasmic. I will make a special trip this week just to buy this dessert."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff, cool atmosphere and good food.  It was something different than the typical lunch.  A must try."}
{"text":"Excellent Food! Friendly staff! The swedish meatballs were great. My co-worker ordered the Hunter's Stew which was fantastic! Highly recommend the Beaver's Supreme & Lemon Fluff!! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"My daughter used Yelp to make reservations for this restaurant last night for 6:00.  When we arrived at the restaurant, the owner met us and when we said that we had reservations she said that we were not on her list.  She went to one of the employees who said that the reservations through Yelp do not work and if we want to make reservations we need to call the restaurant.  She did not care that we had a confirmation from Yelp that we had made a reservation.  While going through this, a couple came in at 6:00 that had a 7:00 reservation.  She was more than happy to accommodate them an hour early.  She asked if we would like to wait at the bar, knowing that we had a toddler with us.  I don't know what the food tastes like, but the service and customer service is extremely bad! Very disappointing as this was to be. Birthday celebration."}
{"text":"I am torn between wanting to tell everyone about this great little neighborhood restaurant and just keeping it to myself so that I don't have to wait in line behind all of you.  Incredibly friendly people running it, delicious and very fresh food, reasonably priced...I loved it.  I highly recommend the pork schnitzel cordon blue.  Be prepared for a wait, since everything is made to order.  They have been open for 3 months and they just got some very good reviews in the local paper, so it was pretty busy last night.  The owner said they are going to add two more tables and she is hiring/training more staff.  You get a discount when you get the food to go, just call your order in ahead of time.  Added benefit:  They have orange soda!  I love orange soda."}
{"text":"We recently discovered Beaver Choice through a Google search. Thrilled at the quality and quantity of their food. Delicious!!! The stuffed mushrooms and crab cakes are a must."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. 
I usually go for the Swedish meatballs, with the creamy dill potatoes and their coleslaw, then some green beans. OH my goodness! So tasty.
The coleslaw is sweet and sour style just like my Oma makes and I could possibly eat the entire bin. The meatballs and tender and juicy and you will likely want more.But you are about to explode from all the food you just ate.
Then your eyes glance over to the baked good section... those oatmeal cookies... yes they have oatmeal but its almost like brittle mixed with some sort of crack. Or their pavalova which is meringue and oranges and pretty much the best thing that your mouth has tasted  other than their other food. 
Customer service is always great the owner is so sweet! Her son is a doll and sells some of his own jewelry creations.
So check it out you wont complain. But just dream of Sweden, Poland, and even Canada because this eclectic mix is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"Would you like a pile of food for a moderate price?  Come to Beaver Choice!  Yes, the entrees cost around $10-13 per person, but what you might not realize when you place your order is that this platter can feed you for 2-3 meals depending on what you pick.  Each item comes with a side dish (something starchy) and three salads (veggie selections.)  Tonight I had the pork tenderloin in gin and cream sauce and my dill potato side dish came heaped on its own plate.  Try the meringue dessert.  I forget what it was called, but it was curiously fantastic.  Crispy meringue layered with whipped cream and mandarin oranges?  Sounds weird, but it worked.  Delicious home-style food served with genuine kindness.  I need to make it a point to choose Beaver Choice more frequently."}
{"text":"Such great service, atmosphere, and food! I went on a Saturday night. Thank goodness I made a reservation. The place is popular. My date and I ordered the number 42 and 44. Both were soooo yum. Their choice of side salads are great! The food was light and fresh. The cream sauce on my dish would be so good on a pasta lol. The service was great and they seemed to genuinely care about their customers. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Don't go to the Beaver Choice on Saturday  thinking you can have lunch. We were promptly sat down on Saturday, 21st, about 11:30, given the Restaurant Week menu and the regular menu. After going through the menus I asked where is the lunch menu that I saw on the web site. The waitress informed us that it is posted by mistake, there is no lunch menu on Saturdays only Tuesday through Friday. We were so disappointed and walked out because we were not going to spend 60 dollars on a lunch! Now I know why the restaurant had so few customers at lunch time. We gave the restaurant 1 star because we will never know what the lunches are like because we both work and Saturdays are the only time we could have found out."}
{"text":"We have been to Beaver Choice twice, and have enjoyed our meals both times. We have tried the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu, the pirogies, the lax pudding and the tilapia in panko. All excellent. 

The service is relaxed, even perhaps a bit slow, but attentive and appropriate. It is a little pricey, in part because you get the right amount of food, not enough to take home for a second meal, but we like that. 

I don't recommend the lava cake dessert - nothing molten and expensive. You can get better elsewhere. There were other desserts that might be more their specialty.

All in all, a nice place. We will be back."}
{"text":"Second time visiting and the food is delicious!! Family owned and run - mom and son are super sweet! I came later in the evening on an \"all you can eat pierogi night\" and they cooked me fresh pierogis that were just mouth watering. Potato cheese and bacon and the cheese and onion were at the top of my list. And I finished it off with cheesecake pierogis at the end! Did I mention the all you can eat pierogis also comes with salad and a polish vegetable soup?! My first visit, I had the moose stew with lingonberries. My best friend is Swedish - and I go often to visit her - and her mom makes a similar dish and was surprised to find the one here as good as my friends moms! If you haven't checked this place out - you need to!! I was also pleasantly surprised to know I could buy pierogis to take home by the dozen!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since the owner had her little joint in Tempe on Broadway! 

The food is still amazing: Fresh, organic, local grown, tasty, traditional, rib-sticking and satisfying.

As a European, I have to say her food is pretty spot-on and authentic. It reminds me of my relatives cooking as a child. Very good snitzel, to-die-for Swedish meatballs with lingonberries! My always first go-to though is the Poutine. Good eating!

The owner is a sweet and wonderful woman whom takes her time to say hello to each customer and make her way to each individual table to say hello and check on the meal/ service. The chef is a kind Russian man who is very good at what he does.

make sure to come early or call in advance because this place fills up quick! Especially now that she is at a bigger location.
and Don't forget dessert! The beaver-cookies are so good."}
{"text":"When I travel, I look for unique places to eat. I like local flavors and small businesses doing what they do to the very best of their ability. I hate large-scale, mediocrity-soaked chain restaurants that you can find absolutely anywhere. So I look at Google, Yelp, UrbanSpoon ratings and take my chances. So tonight I found this place in Tempe, AZ called Beaver Choice. Hundreds of reviews and a great rating. They advertised themselves as a Scandinavian/Polish restaurant. So I went. It was a hole-in-the wall in a strip mall with plastic chairs and flourescent lighting -- order at the counter style. I was tentative, but not for long. The young blonde boy who took my order smiled and spoke with a Sweedish accent. I guess they get mostly regulars becasue the older woman working near the kitchen behind him asked me how I found their place in a very heavy Sweedish accent. I ordered a Chicken Schnitzel Cordon Bleu. It came with dill mashed potatoes, sauteed green beans, peas, and a salad. At the fountain there was RC Cola and 7-Up. I mentioned that you don't see RC Cola much anymore and the lady responded that they support as many local businesses as possible. Score one. After a short wait, the boy delivered my order; it was very nicely presented. And it was incredible. The chicken was tender and juicy; the ham and cheese inside was bursting with flavor, and the sides dishes were all fresh and delicious. I devoured my plate and was full but wanted more. Serious score. Good job, Beaver's Choice. If I'm ever in Tempe again, you'll get my return business. Yum!"}
{"text":"What a mixed feeling after I finally tried the place I bookmarked on Yelp ages ago. We had crab cake as appetizer and ordered hunter stew and schnitzel later. Although all of the items have good flavors I can't help feeling a little let down when I get potato salad when I ordered pickled beets as a side. Moreover I got regular pork schnitzel instead of Viking style one as I ordered... The waitress seemed overwhelmed with so many table to attend and didn't have time to check on us so I had to eat whatever is brought to me and had my glass empty for a long time :( my bf got a hunter stew with like two tiny cubes of meat and tons of cabbage lol on the bright side we found a great beer for summer - radler warka which is 40% beer and 60% lemonade. Since it's so far from where I live the experience didn't really justify the 35min drive and hence we probably won't go there again unless we happen to be in that area for something"}
{"text":"The pierogies should be on the menu all the time. So dang good"}
{"text":"Great place for a fun evening of dining.  Great dishes to choose from!  Swedish, Polish and Canadian.  Top it off with Beaver Supreme.  Can see why it was chosen by Arizona republic as one of the top 10!!"}
{"text":"I think Beaver Choice may be my favorite restaurant of all time. Here's why:

- The food is outstanding. Do not miss the seared gravlax or the coleslaw. Also, do not skip the items that require an extra wait (especially the fish bake). The wait is worth it. I've made it through most of the menu. I even tried the flying Jacob. I have absolutely loved every meal. 
- Great service. The type of place where you really feel like family.
- Ridiculously good value. The portions and quality for the price cannot be beat.
- Beaver Choice makes me want to talk about the love put into the food, and I'm not that type of person. But really, you can't deny that there is love in that food."}
{"text":"Fantastic food cooked with care and served by wonderful people.

The chicken schnitzel cordon-bleu is perfection. Close behind are the Swedish meatballs, and any salmon dish. All the sauces and gravies and dressings are beautifully crafted. There are a multitude of veggie sides to choose from, and you can swap a starch for two sides. The only dish I've tried I didn't absolutely love was the laxpudding, but only because it was a little too salty."}
{"text":"The food at Beaver Choice Scandinavian Bistro is delicious; a little unusual, but easily understood. Hearty and reasonably priced. You can find out all about it at azcentral.com in an article by Howard Seftel. Then, after reading this survival guide, you should go and try it.

     Things you will need:
 1. An afternoon or evening with no commitments other than your meal. This could take a long, long time.
 2. A pen and a piece of paper on which to write your order (along with an alternate choice).
 3. Dining companions who all enjoy the same foods and are willing to eat off the same plate.
 4. A snack to tide you over until your food arrives.
 5. A sense of humor (but try not to laugh out loud),

     Here's our experience:

     Four of us entered the small, 20 seat restaurant at 12:10. There were six other people seated at the minimalist glass top tables. A large, and very appetizing looking catering order was taking up another table. We were given menus and told to order at the counter. There were many, many choices of entrees (a few warned that they would take between 20 and 35 minutes to prepare - we avoided those), and each one came with a choice of four side dishes. You can see why a paper and pen might come in handy. Ken went to place our order, but he had to wait for three other people who had arrived before him. It took a while.  Then he was told that my entree choice was not available because they had run out of gravlax. I came up with another selection, and Ken went back to the counter - where another group of people had taken his place and were ordering. Another wait, then my second choice wasn't available either. The sauce had to be reduced and wouldn't be ready until Tuesday. I figured I'd be safe with a third choice of Swedish meatballs, so I yelled over to Ken who saw that each of our orders was being written on a separate piece of paper. Odd.

     We settled in to wait for our food. Our drinks were brought to the table. Sena's eyes popped when she sipped the pitch black coffee. The waitress said it was always that strong and that there was no milk or half and half available, but she could bring out some heavy cream. I noticed that food was coming out of the kitchen painfully slowly. One dish to one table, a while later, one dish to a different table. Companions were left twiddling their thumbs. It so reminded me of Hell's Kitchen - I could hear Gordon Ramsey going ballistic: \"Shut it down you &*#$%!!!!\" . At about 1 PM my Swedish Meatballs were delivered. I put the plate in the middle of the table and invited everybody to dig in. Luckily the servings are large. We finished that off and waited another ten minutes before Sena's chicken schnitzel arrived. That too was shared. At about 1:35 Ken's entree was brought. That left Leon, who had ordered Tilapia. We flagged down the owner and told her that we had a 2 PM engagement and would like our remaining dish. She said she'd look into it, went into the kitchen and was not seen again. A while later another staff member came over and told us that there had been a large catering order, that they had only a six burner stove  and that 2 employees had called in sick. I mentioned that I didn't think it was right to serve some people at a table and not others. \"This is the way we do it, we're not going to change it, and Howard Seftel thought it was all right\", was the emphatic reply. More waiting. At 1:50 a different staff member came over and said it would be a few more minutes. To our disconcerted rumblings he said - and you're not going to believe this - \"The fish has to be defrosted slowly because of the parasites....\"  At this point, I'll confess, I started to laugh loudly and somewhat
hysterically. It may have been rude, but I couldn't help myself. 

     We were out of time, so Leon decided he'd take the fish to go. Ken went up to the counter and gave one of my Valley Vittles cards to the \"parasite\" staff member, saying that the food was great but the service terrible. At which point the staff member had a melt-down, yelled at Ken to get out of his restaurant, then went slamming through the kitchen kicking something on the way out. 

     This was truly one of the oddest dining experiences I've ever had. Very Alice in Wonderland. But if you go equipped with the five items mentioned above, you'll have some excellent food."}
{"text":"Not very often in life do I encounter genuinely nice people who make wonderful food.  This is such a mythical place.  The family is sweet, the prices low, and the food is made with love.  Go there and enjoy.  Also, they have gluten free options."}
{"text":"Wish I had read the reviews first. They were busy but obviously can't handle it. Expect what should be an hour dining experience to take 2.5 hours.
 
The owner/manager? woman that worked the floor has a defensive attitude and lots of excuses but no time to listen to the customer.

Disappointing. 

In the future I will stick with Zur-Kate German Restaurant in Mesa."}
{"text":"First things first. Can anyone say the name 'Beaver Choice' without snickering a little behind their hand? 

Ok, now that I've gotten that out of my system, I adore Beaver Choice! Today was our second experience with them and it is quickly becoming a favorite. 

This is not a restaurant to judge by appearances because, let's face it, the appearance is anything but high class. From the awkward beaver paintings on the front windows (at least I THINK that thing is a beaver...), to the flimsy dining tables and chairs, to the artwork on the walls that range from nice floral paintings to 'I'm bored and I'm going to paint a color tornado!'. I'm not a huge stickler for ambiance in a restaurant, but this place could definitely use a face-lift. 

BUT 

The food is the real story here and it is definitely worth writing home about. They have a fairly decently sized menu with with items for the faint-of-heart and adventurous palette alike. On this particular trip, my friend had the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon Bleu ($10.75). One look at their website and you know that they are proud of this puppy, and justifiably. The combination of perfectly crispy, brown schnitzel, brie and ham is divine. Her only complaint was that it was a little too greasy. 

I opted for Jansson's Temptation ($10.75). Mind you, I'm the kind of person who tends to gravitate towards the most seemingly unusual item on the menu.  We're talking anchovies, potatoes, onions and cream all baked into a surprisingly delicious treat. It is not very fishy at all, but is really more like a rich hash with hints of salt from the anchovies. It was perhaps a little overdone (the top was more crispy than I would have liked), but I would absolutely order it again. I found it particularly amusing that the owner felt it necessary to come out and check on me a few times to make sure I liked it. I promise, Ma'am, it was wonderful! The only reason I only ate half was because it was huge and very heavy. I'm thinking that other half is going to end up a midnight snack. 

If you want something similar but aren't quite up for anchovies yet, try the Laxpudding ($10.75), which is sort of like a potato fritter with salmon. I had it last time and it is also outstanding, especially with the amazing mustard that was served with it. I have no idea what that mustard was, but I want more! 

In addition to the already massive entrees, you get a side and three salads. I won't go into much on these, because they are pretty straight forward. You know what green beans are. No surprises. However, when you order, you are doing yourself a GRAVE disservice if you fail to order the tomato-basil salad. Perhaps my favorite thing on the entire menu. It is extraordinarily fresh and the combination of herbs and oil make it completely to die for. In fact, for my side salads this time, I got broccoli and two orders of the tomato-basil salad. Next time? Probably three. 

Finally, we finished off our meal by sampling the beaver balls ($1 each) and the beaver cookies ($1.50 each). The beaver balls were ok. Honestly, not much more to say about them than that. They were chocolate, so you can't go wrong there, but other than that, kind of boring. The beaver cookies, were a complete surprise. I haven't the first idea what kind of cookies they are, but they had a slightly caramel flavor to them and they were a light, crispy texture. Looking at them, I expected them to be crunchier, but they were just perfect. Sandwiched between the two cookies is a lime-y cream that was very tart and smooth and complimented the cookie perfectly. They were a wonderful way to round off a great meal. 

Beaver Choice has recently started a loyalty program. I would recommend joining up, even if it's just your first visit. Don't worry. You'll be back."}
{"text":"This is VERY authentic Scandinavian food!
We have been to Sweden multiple times and, since moving to Phoenix, have bemoaned the fact that there is no Scandinavian food (unless you count IKEA).  I was thrilled to discover this place.

The pytt i panna and Laxpudding both were seasoned very similar to dishes we've ate in Sweden.  Delicious!

Let us also say that we've ate at very posh Scandinavian restaurants in New York City and this is, by far, the most authentic Swedish food we've tried.  The family who runs Beaver Choice is warm, helpful, and accommodating.  We will be going back frequently."}
{"text":"Despite the crazy name, I knew I'd hit the jackpot as soon as I tasted the perogies. I'm a Polish Girl from Western Pennsylvania, and it has been a very very long time since I've had a proper pierogi. Not only do they do it right, they have so many varieties that I can't wait to go back and try them all. I am also completely in love with their beet salad. I ended up taking a container home I loved it so much. Yes, they're food is fantastic, but so is their wait staff, and the owners are always there and more than happy to chat with you and make sure that you are completely satisfied with your meal."}
{"text":"AAAAMAZING!!!  This place is Great.  Not what you'd expect from the outside.  Beaver has an open dining room and seemless flow to the Bar/dining area.  Nicely illuminated and clean and modern inside.  Now the Menu.  WOW! The owner herself brought out that days Pierogies filled with a seasoned mashed potato and they were great.  I haven't had good Jager Schnitzel since I was in Germany and this was beyond Delicious.  I don't remember what my Gal had but it came with Gravy Fries and they were fantastic.  Portions wire very large so we didn' thave room for desert.  Even the Beer list is Awesome with imports from places like Crotia, Slovakia, Poland and Russia  The Owner made sure to check on everyone personally and she is one super amazing lady.  She saw us off with a big hug as we left.  What a great family restaurant.
My Gal and I have already reserved a table for Valentines day diner."}
{"text":"all processed food and not fresh....very disappointed and will not recommend or return. even more disappointed by the high yelp rating as yelp has not steered me wrong up to this point. going to be more selective w/yelp going forward."}
{"text":"Restaurant is amazing. The staff is incredibly friendly. We have eaten here just a few times and the experience is always better than the time before. The food is delicious and presented well. The flavors are unique but also something you only want more of. We find ourselves wanting to come back often as the service is the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was excellent as well. Great dining experience! Would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has amazing everything!!! From schnitzel and pierogis to desserts.... absolutely amazing! And the owner is the absolute sweetest. I felt like I was at my grandmothers"}
{"text":"Was thrilled to find an establishment that not only knows how to make authentic foods but everything is made in house and FRESH! The service was beyond friendly, so I highly recommend coming and trying out any of their delicious meals or desserts!"}
{"text":"The words \"exciting and unique\" are not ones I would often use in relation to cuisine in Mesa, AZ., but that doesn't hold for Beaver Choice.  In a town not known for it's inventive restaurant experience this restaurant stands out by a mile.  The key to their culinary success is a simple one - cook from scratch with prime quality ingredients, and add a heaping portion of passion.  The style reflects the life experience of owner of the restaurant and is a mixture of Polish, Swedish, and Canadian influences that will leave your needing a big nap, then wanting more, more, more.   The food is simple in form but complex in taste.  The French Canadian favorite poutine made for a great starter.  There was lashings of gravy and curds atop tasty fries.  It was rich and satisfying. For main course I had the pork schnitzel cordon blue.  I highly recommend it. The meat was tender, the batter delicate, and the use of brie instead of the traditional emmentaler, delicious.  The award-winning chocolate meringue desert was heavenly and reminded me of the delights European dining.  Fresh cream makes everything better and coupled with the gooey meringue.......divine!  I could go on about the food for hours, particularly the signature Pierogis. 

 Staff were very friendly (even bringing out an unsolicited sample of Pierogis for us to taste), and knowledgeable, and service was highly efficient.  Prices of the dishes were extremely reasonable, with main courses generally in the range of $15 - $16, and portions are ample.  One thing to note however, this is a restaurant about the experience.  It means that a great deal of attention goes into all they do and everything is made to order, not partially precooked.   If you go there expecting the typical dining experience of assembly line cooking then this is not a place for you.  Great food takes a little longer to prepare but only a short one and it's worth the wait.  If you want the same old same old, go to a restaurant chain.  Mesa is full of them.  If you want to relish your food and the company you're with, this is for you.  I will be back for sure and I will be bringing friends.  This is a treasure that's too good not to share."}
{"text":"If you want old country comfort food this place is fantastic. There are so many delicious dishes to choose from. I mapped out my next three visits!
Can't wait to come back. Fresh, home made, flavorful fare."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and fresh! The staff are genuine and honest folks. I love to support the independent restaurants. The deserts are tasty and not heavy. Made from wholesome ingredients with love. Take the time and awaken your taste buds to this awesome Scandinavian cafe. Most enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Was in AZ for a conference and a friend had a huge craving for Scandinavian food. It's located in a strip mall and looks like a cafeteria with a stuffed Beaver on the counter. There's games to play while you wait, which is nice. 

The food was reasonably priced and the Swedish meatballs tasted amazing. Even all their side dishes were delicious.

They have poutine!!! I finally understood why all my Canadians missed home. I gained 5 pounds that weekend. So worth it."}
{"text":"The menu offers an interesting variety of dishes, many of which were unfamiliar to us.  We had been to the old location in Tempe, and their new location is closer to us in Mesa, and has a great deal more seating space.

The staff is eager to explain the menu items, and will offer small samples, if requested.  There is now a full bar, with an interesting selection of beers, wines and liquor.

On each of our visits, we have been very pleased with the quality of the food and service, and the meals are nicely presented and very tasty.  This is definitely someplace we will visit again."}
{"text":"Excellent food & Service. Ordered the Hunters Stew. Totally satisfied the craving I had for something savory. We ordered the Lemon Fluff & Beavers Supreme for dessert. Both were fantastic! What a find for first timers."}
{"text":"We found this places by mistake.  Service was awesome, portions were huge. We got the perogies,corden bleu, and poutin and the desserts looked amazing. Ill be there again!"}
{"text":"Heavenly! Pure heaven!!

After living in Poland I sometimes get a hankering for some good Polish eats and this place does the trick! Best part is, I can say the few polish phrases that I know AND they understand me. 

I got the  chicken schnitzel cordon bleu, it was FANTASTIC. Highly recommended. 

I also got the mandarin dessert -- OH MY GOSH. This was GREAT. GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!!!!!

YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!"}
{"text":"We were on this side of town and decided to try this place since a friend recommended it.The food was FANTASTIC.The presentation was impressive and taste was incredible. everything was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Tasty authentic Scandinavian food.  Prepared and served by friendly authentic Scandinavians."}
{"text":"My husband said \"Every restaurant owner should come in here to see what clean means\", you could have eaten off the floor.  Friendly staff and attentive to gluten free requirements.  The beet salad, simple, was excellent.  The Cordon Blue schnitzel was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful pork flavor.  Ample serving size allowed both of us to share a meal so that we could also share a dessert.  Both my husband and I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"In my opinion one of the better restaurants in Mesa--where there is a dearth of good local dining options.
The Rhubarb Chicken was excellent and even better than the food back in Minnesota or my Scandinavian grandma could have made. 
First time we went we got introduced to the owner who is super nice. She picks very good music mostly jazz standards which adds to the nice local ambience."}
{"text":"Take your business elsewhere, I can promise you it won't be appreciated here. We have frequented this sad excuse for a restaurant for sit down dinner & for pick up of pierogi to take home. The service has always been slow & there is only a slight glimmer of a cold welcome upon arrival. I will never return here although the food deserves some acknowledgment, probably being a 3.5. I didn't leave mad or disappointed, I left sad knowing that a business that should thrive on hospitality is sorely lacking and treats customers and potential regulars badly.

                    Tonight was a total waste of time: My husband went in ahead of us at 8:32 to make sure they were still open since their hours said they were open until 9, but they appeared closed. As the rest of our small party got out of the car I watched him be completely ignored by what I know to be the owner. Once I got inside, bell ringing to signal human life, we were once again ignored. The owner sat with 2 friends laughing, back turned and looking at a phone. I finally interrupted & asked her if they were still serving dinner and she very defensively said the kitchen closed at 8:30, umm less than 5 mins prior. She never stood up and showed any kind of customer service and was dismissive to us, she then turned back to her friends and continued cackling like we were never there. Rude, cold, condescending, unappreciative, this is what you're supporting when you choose to bring your business here."}
{"text":"I recommend this place to everybody I know. Lovely family owns the place who are super nice and always willing to recommend what to try and what to pair with everything. Between my friends and I, I've tried the pork schnitzel cordon bleu, the stuffed steak, the flying jacob (or something like that), the pork schnitzel, the beaver supreme, and the swedish meatballs. Everything has been wonderful and extremely tasty (I've also heard that the gravlax is immense). Everything tastes homemade. I don't know if that explains it well enough, but when I eat there I feel like it's not restaurant food that's been dunked in butter and swiped clean from the actual feel of \"food.\" 

It is a much smaller place as some other reviewers have said, be aware of that if you're planning on bringing a larger group. Some of the items do have to be prepared then and can take a while to make, but these are marked clearly on the menu. The prices may seem a little high but remember that you get your meal, and basically four sides with the dinner entrees. I know they sell sandwiches at lunch but have not yet tried those.  

Anyways, I can't recommend the place highly enough. I'll continue bringing my friends in the hopes that this place stays going."}
{"text":"We loved this place, we had the chicken and pork schnitzel and the Sweden meatbals, all delicious. We also tried the dumplings, amazing. Family owned business, they are very nice and friendly, great service."}
{"text":"This is one of the best kept secrets in the east valley. The service here is Amazing!! Allison served us and the owner gave us great advice on the Cordon Chicken Schnitzel. Also you need to make sure you try the Pierogi Starter."}
{"text":"While in the area, looked to Yelp for a new place to try. And so here we are...

THE PLACE: Not hard to find at all. Visible right on Baseline Road as it was in a mini strip mall, but it was closest to the road. Ample parking available. Interior is a nice open space. Simple decor of pictures of the Scandinavian region. The dining area was clean. And the bar looked stocked.

THE SERVICE: We were immediately greeted as we walked through the door and seated wherever we chose. Menus on hand from the server and she asked us for our drink order. She was upfront about items they did not have available and apologized for that, which I really appreciate.There were quite a few she named which included the fish bake which I understand a lot of people really like. Thankfully, not something I was dying to have ;)

THE FOOD: Worth the few minutes wait. On our table were the Pork Scnitzel (Pork loin schnitzel served with porcini mushroom gravy), Seared Gravlax (Swedish cured salmon with house signature shrimp salad and dill mustard sauce) and Captain's Fish (Haddock loin, heavy cream, tomatoes, dill). Each plate came with 3 very small side salads and 1 side dish. Sides we chose were Home Made Cole Slaw, Beet Salad and some greens. Sides, Rosti (potato pancake) and Cous Cous.  Each plate with the sides were simply divine.  The mushroom gravy for the schnitzel was so good, I imagined just having it with other items I know it would be good with. The Seared Gravlax with the rosti, was just delicious.

If you want to get a taste of Scandinavian cuisine, this is a pretty good place to try. Definitely going back.

TIP: Call ahead if you have a specific item you are craving for to make sure they have it available. Reminder that many of their bake items do take 45 minutes to prepare."}
{"text":"Coming to Arizona from Pennsylvania with a  Dutch and Polish inspired cuisine growing up, this is the closest thing to home. The food is amazing and the company is just as amazing. Hannah is one of the most inspiration chefs I've met in my life. I recommend this place completely if you want to try something new, not a dish on the menu will ever disappoint!"}
{"text":"As I was planning my trip to Scandinavia, I wanted to try some authentic dishes. After googling, I stumbled across this little gem. I had the elk stew and it was great! It reminded me of this creamy mushroom stew that I had at a French-style Belgium restaurant in Brugge. My gf got the vegetarian pierogi and that was delicious as well. We probably should have tried the pickled herring but the portions were extremely generous and we weren't able to fit an additional bite. Service was excellent. Would come back and will definitely try the herring next time."}
{"text":"The hubs and I were looking for something delicious and local and so we turned to Yelp for help. Once again, Yelpers, you have helped us discover one of the wonders of the world. Beaver Choice is the best place in Tempe for eats. Hands down! We were greeted by a heart-warmingly kind Swedish family that cooks Scandinavian food with pride and care. We were immediatley welcomed, offered samples, patiently guided through the menu. I asked the darling guy at the counter what he had for dinner and he said he had the schnitzel cordon bleu. Done, I said. The hubs cannot pass up a meatball opportunity, so he had the swedish meatball plate. They schnitzel cordon bleu is UNBELIEVABLE, people. I dare anyone not to love it. Crisped, tender, juicy schnitzel, high quality, smoky ham and a dash of brie, accompanied by a heavenly, light, mushroom sauce. Oh, god. I'm not describing this right, You have to try it. Wow. Okay I'm going after I finish this review. Served with the giant double-portion of stuffed schnitzel were a basil-tomato salad, a coleslaw chock full of fresh dill and a bean salad featuring chopped parsely. The fresh herbs were so amazing alongside the hearty meat dish. Just delicious. It also came with a side of rosti'--a sort of hash brown cooked in some butter to a crisp. The hub's meatball plate was outstanding as well, but you'll have to ask him about it--my meal was too incredible to look away from. 

Bottom line: Kind people, amazing food, huge portions, reasonable prices. This is as good as it gets. My choice will always be Beaver."}
{"text":"if you're looking for Scandinavian food i can't imagine there are any other places to go.  so naturally this is the best this city has to offer.  small.  sterile, fast, and moderately priced.  all things ikea naturally....lol  but the food and the staff are the real stars here.  
overly friendly staff, family of fun swedes !  mom is great and the spokesperson, christian takes the orders and is more than talkative and charming.  plus he was wearing a santa hat!  i got the special, which was a meat perogie plus peas, saurkraut and cole slaw....all really tasty.  my friends got a chicken schnitzel and some swedish meatballs.  and wow!  all the food was really great!  the mashed potatoes were delicious and hey this is not your typical strip mall food flavors.  so it was a big bonus to discover this place.  and like most others who are writing reviews it's prob. gonna be a place i will revisit.  bring some out of town visitors here to give some them something unique ."}
{"text":"I pass by this resturant everyday for work and I decided to stop in and WOW this resturant is amazing. Friendly people with excellent service that makes you feel right at home. The food is to die for with excellent dishes from all over Europe. Great food for the cost and great atmosphere. This has become one of my top resturants in Arizona. You must come in."}
{"text":"My father loves this place because he's very fond of traditional home cooking but a bit too bland for myself and my wife who shared with me that there's a funny smell instead of an enticing aroma. Heads up Hanna! Honestly, I do not smell any thing but possibly that's the problem. My wife has excellent senses so I'm quite sure something can be greatly improved. Also, I would refine the outside eating area to attract more drive by customers."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and seeing the 4 star rating I was excited to try Beavers Choice. I went with a party of 9 people. We were all first time customers. 
Here's my Cons: The meal is all sides and a very small portion of meat. 
Approximately $15-$18 per plate, before tip. 
Pros: The pickled beets taste like my Oma's."}
{"text":"my husband is A swedish national trapped in a land of desert cuisine.  when i found this place he nearly flipped!  he said it was excellent, authentic, and just what he wanted.  going back today for lunch!"}
{"text":"Being Swedish, this place is close to my heart. Service was quick today at lunch. Low key music made it easy to talk with our many guests. 

Food is a great cross section of Swedish and Polish cuisine!! 
I've been here several times, but forgot to check in... Because I focus on eating."}
{"text":"Amazing food, large portions, expertly prepared.  There was not a single item on any of the plates that was not delicious. If you are looking for something out of the ordinary, give the Beaver Choice a try."}
{"text":"So, is it worth the cross valley drive from Goodyear to Mesa to try out this restaurant? Well, that's going to depend on your dining tastes.  We came here on a Thursday night for their all-you-can-eat pierogi dinner (as if my waistline really needs it!).  The first thing that struck me about the restaurant is the decoration.  Nothing over-the-top; actually kind of sparse; but the whole place, from the furniture to the lighting to the entire layout reminded me of the 1970s.  I can't exactly explain why.  The place is pretty big, but it reminded me of a furniture store that was turned into a restaurant.  That said, the place isn't unattractive; just ... retro(?); I don't know.

I was also surprised to see only two other tables besides ours taking advantage of the special (and the place was packed full).  I overheard the bartender saying that only about \"30%\" of the patrons come for the all-you-can-eat pierogies.  To be honest, I have a hard time understanding why; not only because the pierogies are good, but because Scandinavian food is ungodly heavy and pierogi is about the only thing on the menu that won't cause you to sink to the bottom of Tempe Lake if you accidentally fall in one night after dinner!  As I looked around at the copious amount of food and beer at other tables, I thought to myself, \"OK, this makes sense:  you burn a lot of calories just trying to stay warm in cold climates and if you're outside chopping wood, fishing or just shoveling, you need heavy, fatty food to replace those lost calories.\"  But in Arizona?!?!

I can't comment on the other food in the restaurant, but from what I saw, it certainly looked incredibly delicious (though I challenge you to find anything on the menu with less than 1000 calories with the exception of the chopped slaw salad served with the pierogi and the Diet RC cola ... and btw, RC Cola?  I think that reminded me of the Seventies even more as I don't think I've had an RC since I was 13)!   

The pierogis are a hit and miss:  we both agree the sauerkraut and mushroom ones are the best; the meat-filled ones the least attractive (and I'm sorry, but jalapeno and potato pierogis don't work for me; I'm never going to be a fan of Mexican-Polish fusion).  That's where our agreement ended:  he likes them fried; I like them steamed.  We both liked the borscht (barszcz).

Service is attentive and friendly.

So, in conclusion, if you have an urge to pig out on pierogis, yes, it's worth the drive out here.  The price can't be beat.  Frankly, even if you're as big a pig as we are, you're not going to eat enough pierogi to make them sorry for offering an all-you-can-eat option; on the other hand, even if you don't eat til you burst, $10.95 for even a plate of the things is a very good deal.  My only complaint would be I just can't handle heavy food like that anymore and I really doubt I'd want to try when the thermometer goes above 90F.  But that's my problem; not yours."}
{"text":"I ate at their Tempe location before they moved and had a good experience.  I was excited when they finally opened at their new location.  A friend and I went a few days after they opened and were looking forward to a nice meal.  We were prepared to be very patient because we knew that they were just opened and the staff were still learning.  It was a hot day outside and it felt stuffy inside, so we casually mentioned to our server that it felt warm inside the restaurant and maybe they could check the temperature.  Well, that is when the whole experience went downhill.  A minute later we heard the female owner speaking very loudly near the servers station that it was 76 degrees...it is 76 degrees, she kept loudly repeating that it was 76 degrees.  She then came over to our table and very rudely told us that the thermostat said 76 degrees, so why did we say it was warm?  We just simply said that it felt warm to us and she then proceeded to tell us that we should get up and go look at the thermostat.  It was an extremely off putting experience.  Her tone and demeanor was very unfriendly and we felt like we had been scolded by our grandmother.  

In my opinion, the food here is a little pricey, but has tasted pretty good when we have eaten there before.  However, my friend and I both felt afterwards that it is not a place that we would ever go again because of the attitude and tone in which we were spoken to. It is a shame, but you can't treat people that way and expect them to come back.  I hope they read this review so they can learn from our experience and prevent further damage to their business reputation."}
{"text":"I read about Thunderbird Lodge as being tired and dated and stale. \"It could be so much more etc...\"...We checked into room 72 and found the room fresh, clean and NEW! Curtains, lights and bedspreads and carpets  were updated.  A fridge,microwave and Keurig coffee maker were there. The bathroom was perhaps not brand new, but the curtain for the shower was the convex kind and the water pressure excellent even if the water was very soft. The  shower and soap amenities were good quality.  You park right outside your door for convenience. The front desk staff were friendly.   Our Canyon de Chelly auto  tour was excellent, but I don't rate that here. I don't know about the other rooms, but ours was excellent. I would come back here in a heartbeat. ( We are experienced travelers who are both US and European travelers, so are not the uber spoiled kind)."}
{"text":"The food is SCRUMPTIOUS!  The portion sizes are very generous and the service was superb.  Will definitely go back on Thursday's for all you can eat pierogi."}
{"text":"Been here twice. This is the place to go if you like central and eastern European comfort food. No Italian here. German, Polish, Scandinavian, and some Quebec style comfort foods. The owner is very personable. The food is prepared fresh. The prices are very reasonable. Note that fresh food takes some time to prepare, so allow for some wait time. No prefab frozen food here. They now have their periogies freezer ready so you can take a few dozens home with you. Don't forget to try the deserts."}
{"text":"Great food, solid customer service. The menu is a bit pricey but you're paying for good quality. Everything is made when it's ordered, so leave yourself enough time to enjoy the meal."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  I really enjoyed the schnitzel and the potato salads.  The cabbage rolls were good but I have had better. We ate the lunch buffet so I think if you order them as an entree, they would rock.  People are friendly and the service is good.  

Everyone should try this place at least once.  We will be back to sample other fare.  They have Poutine from Canada!!!"}
{"text":"When I saw Beaver's Choice on Eden Eats, I thought it was time to give it a try.  I'd never had Scandinavian food before and tonight, I was wanting something new.

This place might be small, perhaps a little intimidating when you're passing by it, but don't let that fool you.

Since it's a Friday night, the place was busy. Good thing I knew what I wanted before I even got there.

I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel. I don't even remember the last time I shoved food in my face so fast that by the time I reached the last bite, I was disappointed that it was all gone, even the four sides that came with it!

If you want something out of the ordinary, this is the place for you. I already have my second & third meals planned out for my future visits. Bring a friend, or something to read, or something to keep you busy since your food might take a while depending how busy the kitchen gets. It IS SO worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"I am not really familiar with Scandinavian cuisine but this was really good. I had the chicken schnitzel and tried the meat balls we ordered for our children and both were yum! Our kids devoured them before even touching the fries which is quite rare for them.  They also have an interesting assortment of sides with each meal."}
{"text":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I pulled into the strip mall parking lot.  I saw the name on the storefront, but was a little thrown with large signs advertising sandwiches, salads and soup.  I stepped into the establishment to find a casual set-up of a few tables and chairs.  

I was looking forward to the Scandanavian choices that fellow Yelpers had raved about.  I first picked up one menu that offered the mundane offerings of sandwiches and soups that you can get anywhere else.  But then I found their second menu containing all the goodies I had been looking for.  I decided to go with the baked cod, beet salad, potato salad, spinach salad and rosti (large hashbrown).

My lunch came out completely filling the plate, including an extra plate for the rosti (which I took home).  The fish was delicately cooked to perfection accompanied by the colorful salads.  I attempted to finish my plate, but wanted to savor every bite.  Delightful, with leftovers!

I overheard the owner say they were moving locations soon, so call before you go so you don't miss out."}
{"text":"After seeing the sign for Beaver Choice a few months ago, I had been eager to give it a try. I finally got the chance today. 

I was impressed before even ordering. The guy behind the counter was very friendly and ready to offer suggestions. When I inquired about the salmon, he gave me a sample (along with beet and potato salads.)

The salmon was so delicious, I ended up ordering the Swedish cured salmon sandwich (complete with a sweet dill mustard dressing.) My lovely dining partner ordered the Fresh Mozzarella, salami, tomato
& basil sandwich and we decided to share an order of poutine. We both enjoyed the sandwiches and loved the poutine! 

Almost as enjoyable as the food was the service. This restaurant is owned by a family who has lived in several parts of the world. They are very friendly and willing to bend over backwards for the customers.

I am excited to go back and delight in more dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place to have Dinner. Our daughter found this place because it had alot of gluten free items. The people who run this place are the nicest and most genuine people you will ever meet. Don't be fooled by the location in a strip mall. The food was absolutely to die for! Talk about Scandinavian home cooking at its best, well here it is. There are some real surprise dishes well worth the wait for them to cook, just like you would at grandmas house! Wow, what a treat this place was, check it out!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here many times over several years now.  We've never been disappointed with the food.  It is always delicious and we love eating here.  The service can be uneven in its quality - specifically it can be very slow.  If you're on a tight time frame - I would wait and come here when it's not an issue.  If the service was better we would rate it 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am now asking myself why it took so long to make the first trip to Beaver Choice.  Live and learn, my friends, live and learn.

To break my Swedish cuisine cherry I ordered the standard Kotbullar (Swedish meatball) plate.  It came with 3 side salads, a side and a small dish of very tart lingon berry preserve.  For the salads I chose tomato-basil salad, home made coleslaw and green peas.  For the side I chose two scoops of dill mashed potatoes.  All made perfect company for the 6 meatballs that served as the focal point of the dish.  The food was very good for $11.21 I had a hearty lunch that will surely hold me over for quite some time.  My belly is full and I feel like a nap (if only I was not departing for work shortly!).

Service was top notch.  The kid working the register was very friendly and answered my questions pertaining to the menu.  He was friendly and chatty with all customers.  I was told my lunch would take 15 minutes but it was more like 10.  There looks to be a few complaints here regarding service time but there's always a wait for good food.  If you want pre-cooked meals sitting under a UV light then go to McDonald's.

A nice touch is the IKEA decor.  Tables, chairs, table service and little Swedish flags.  Fitting.

I will be back at Beaver Choice in the not too distant future.  The only debate will be getting the meatballs again or trying something new."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic!  Best meal we've had since moving to the east valley in 2011.  I had the sampler plate of swedish meatballs and hash and my wife had the entree of swedish hash.  BOTH WERE TO DIE FOR!  Generous portions also come with several side choices - the homemade coleslaw was amazing. We also tried the apple torte and vanilla pudding for dessert and after devouring them, considered ordering another round - they were THAT GOOD!  This family owned restaurant has vaulted to the TOP of our restaurant list...can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very fresh and authentic food. The owner was very friendly and patient as we weren't sure as to what to order. Great pierogies and for desert, I got a peice of what looked like cheese cake. she said she made it there so I had to have a peice. It was sooo good!! Lighter and not as rich as cheesecake that I am used to. I could eat the hole thing!!!
I am sad to hear that they are moving as it will be farther from our home."}
{"text":"The location is lovely, the selection of beer is fabulous, the grav lox is outstanding but the rest of the selections we choose from the menu were not as good as we were expecting. Texture was a big issue, vegetables were over cooked and mushy and that is a big turn off.
Also the restaurant's hours are a bit odd. If you tend towards later dinner then the average, like we do, then Beaver Choice won't work for you they'll close while you're still eating. It's good but not awesome."}
{"text":"If you're in the Tempe area there is Norway you should miss the chance to eat here. The portions were so large I could barely Finnish my meal. I had the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu and my husband had the frikkadeller, and both were delicious. The beet salad sides were perfectly Swedened; just the right balance of savory and sweet. If you like Scandinavian food Denmark this place down on your list of restaurants to visit. 

P.S. Iceland? I don't know."}
{"text":"Loved it! Authentic amazing evening. Hannah is a fabulous host. Enjoyed the salmon and schnitzel cordon bleu. Beaver supreme Desert was outstanding."}
{"text":"Glad we went. The food was tasty albeit a tad boring for my spicy palate.  It was nice to have muliple side dishes to choose from. The restaurant is very nice in yet another unassuming strip mall. We were pleasantly surprised.  Kuddos for a family run business!"}
{"text":"Chicken schnitzel is amazing. More words need to be written..more words 5 stars words words words. Galaxy quest rules. Schnitzel for the win"}
{"text":"The food is delicious (comfort food,) the owners and their son are tremendously kind, and the restaurant is clean and comfortable.  

Go to Beaver Choice to relax; this isn't Olive Garden folks, they're not looking to get you in and out in under an hour.  So if you're looking for fast food, go to Wendy's."}
{"text":"Don't let the name deceive you. Beaver Choice is an EXCELLENT dining experience. 

My girlfriend and I decided on a whim to give it a shot (after making the obligatory puns and double entendre's on the name). After staring at the menu for two minutes, trying desperately to decipher what we were to have, we gave up and asked the guy behind the counter's advice. His name was Chris and he was extremely helpful. He sold us with free samples, rather than descriptions of the plate. 

I ordered the gravlax; my girlfriend ordered the laxpudding. We entrusted the quality of our meal to the word of Chris and the small sample we tasted, because, in my mind, the ingredients had no business being together in one dish. Both dishes were based on lox, aka smoked salmon. 

We were both pleasantly surprised at the dish that greeted each of us a few minutes later. The food was EXCELLENT! And while not the cheapest dinner in the world, you get an enormous bang for your buck. Your plate is literally stacked with food. Kudos if you finish it all. 

Bottomline: Beaver Choice has a weird-ass name, but it serves some of the best food in Tempe. We will be back for sure, and I encourage each of you to give it a shot. I guarantee you won't come away disappointed!"}
{"text":"YUM YUM YUM.

I couldn't stop talking about this place after I left... it was that good.  On Friday, my friend and I were on our way to go to a haunted house and she asked if I wanted to go eat some Scandinavian food.  I said what many people here in Phoenix may say and replied, \"what the heck is Scandinavian food?\"

Wow.  I am so glad I didn't bail on dinner.  

1) The place:  The place doesn't exactly look like some great restaurant because it is in the middle of a small strip mall and my friend directed me by saying \"next to the dollar store.\"  However, do not let the outside appearance fool you, because deliciousness awaits inside.  The inside is clean, very straightforward, and decorated with original paintings by someone named \"Maria Fry\" and IKEA tables.  I like my surroundings to be basic, and my food to be bold.  That is when you can expect your food to be made with HEART. 

2) The staff:  The place is owned by a family from Sweden and they also lived in Canada for a bit (from what they tell me).  The son offers samples which is amazing because places do not do that anymore.  It is nice to know that the family is willing to whip up an amuse-bouche at the snap of a finger.  While my friend and I were standing there getting the menu details from the \"captivating business man\" son, I could see the family in the back, ready to make me the meal of my life.  They all had smiles, excited to aid me in my Scandinavian food adventure.

3) The food:  I got the \"Kötbullar: Swedish Meatballs\" which is described on the menu as: Cardamom meatballs - served traditionally with cream sauce, mashed potatoes and lingon berry preserve.

Now I have had alot of meatballs, especially in Italy, and these were definitely authentic.  I could tell the meatballs were homemade - seasoned - rolled - and cooked all by hand.  My favorite thing about the meatballs is that they were not tough or rubbery, but rather almost \"fluffy\" and juicy.  The sauce is like a gravy, think and creamy (mushroom?), I could have drank the stuff it was so delicious.  Mashed potatoes are complimentary to the gravy and they even have fresh seasoning in them --- something very rare in restaurants these days.  Cranberry sauce is a perfect tangy sweetness and I ate it with a bite of meatball and potatoes almost every time.  For about $10, I got all of that (2 scoops of potatoes) as well as 3 different side salad dishes!  The marinated green beans, homemade coleslaw (well everything was homemade so i should probably stop saying that haha!) and tomato salad was included in the meal!  The tomato salad was a bit peppery, but I guess I have been exposed to good tomatoes in Italy so I am a bit biased :).  I could only eat about 2/3's because it was fresh, filling, and amazing.  

My friend ordered off the 'grab and go' menu.  She got the Swedish pita and it was great!  She devoured it leaving no bite behind.  I think besides the meatballs being spectacular, there was an amazing tzatziki sauce on it.  When I compare this pita to the pitas I have eaten in AZ, Michigan, Italy, and Greece, what I appreciate the most is that Beaver Choice's pita is not greasy at all!!  It is filling and didn't make her feel like she just ate a cow afterwards.  I cannot wait to grab this to-go during lunch sometime!

I appreciate good, clean food, especially when you can taste the fact that they made and marinated everything by hand, fresh.  I cannot wait to go back and try the lunch menu :)

PS. Try the beet salad... so good, and I do not normally even like beets!

I found the menu at: http://www.beaverchoice.com/"}
{"text":"Wow what a place!  Great food , excellent service and a very interesting beer selection.  My wife had the cordon blue schnitzel and I had the shoe makers box.  Both were fantastic.  The menu had many other choices and I can't wait to go back.
My party of 3 had 3 entrees , 4 drinks with the bill equally 82$ before tip."}
{"text":"If I had the money to eat here every single night, I would. The atmosphere is excellent, the smells are heavenly and all the selections of beers/wines could make a grown man cry. The servers are happy to be there. You can tell they take care of everyone like they are family."}
{"text":"I stopped by after some golf lessons (look for me in the PGA in a few years) to check out this place.  They were just opening, but much to my delight, I wasn't the only first timer here, as a couple walked in a few moments before me to try out some desserts.

As I walked up to order, the cashier (Chris) could sniff out that it was also my first time here.  He offered a sample, which turned out to be three samples: beet salad, potato salad, and gravlax (cured salmon).  All three were great, and I almost asked for another sample or two to curb my hunger (I decided to save the puppy eyes for Costco).

I ended up getting a small order of poutine (always wanted to try) and the tunnbrodsrulle to go.  Apparently, this was a lot of food, as Adam (who prepared the sample) warned me before I told them that it was my final answer.  This boy is still growing!

Chris asked me how I had heard about Beaver Choice, and I mentioned Yelp.  He, and the rest of the family, were very happy to hear this, and told me that business was starting to pick up due to feedback from Yelp and UrbanSpoon.  I was glad, and told them I'd see them next time (and I meant it!).

When I got home, I immediately popped open the poutine and scarfed it down.  The fries, gravy and cheese curds blended together nicely, and the next time I go drinking, I'll be thinking about a plate of steaming poutine, as gross as that sounds!

I unwrapped the tunbrodsrulle, and I sank into my chair at the sight of it.  Maybe I should have listened to Adam?  I ended up finishing about 1/5th of it before I decided to pack it away for a later meal.  It's a very different wrap from what I've had before, but, like the poutine, it blended together nicely.

The next time you are trying to decide what to eat, make your way here for a little variety in your life.  The family will make you feel welcome (they have tables for dining in), they will offer you samples, and they will even warn you if they think you are ordering way too much food.

The only choice is a Beaver Choice!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The plate sizes are pretty big and each bite is worth the cost. The staff is very friendly too. If you are thinking about eating here you should. The food is completely different than anything Phoenix metro has to offer.  The one con about going here is pronouncing the food names. But, I guess that's not a con since the staff will say it for you and explain what the food is and where it comes from."}
{"text":"We love the food, but their service is SLOW. Insanely slow for the type of food. It's not complex food, it's simple comfort food. But it commonly takes us 45 minutes to get our meal.

Worse yet, when I made a normal, polite consumer comment regarding the slowness to the young guy behind the counter, he told me to go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I am not any kind of expert on Scandinavian food, so take this however you'd like. I thought this food was ok. 
By that, I mean the schnitzel I ate (chicken cordon bleu) was fine but I wouldn't come back for it. The sides were good I guess.

I might give it 3 stars, but the insane prices are just unreasonable. I pay less for much nicer restaurants.

Will I come back? I might, if I'm not paying."}
{"text":"Amazing food, Shoemaker Box is what i tried and i was very very impressed. The food brings you the warm memories of home."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic with a lot of interesting flavors. I would recommend this place to anyone ready to try Scandinavian food. It's sooo much better than I expected.  From the schnitzel to the dessert it was awesome."}
{"text":"Just had a horrible experience at Beaver Choice. Service was slow, and the food did not come out together. There were five in our party and our entrees came out over the course of twenty minutes. One of our meals had a hair in it (stuck to a tomato). Our server was so inattentive, and just said \"I'm sorry\".  No offer to remake the food or take it off the bill. Absolutely disgusting and unbelievable. To top it off, the restaurant charges a $6 \"convenience fee\" for paying with a card. Will never be back and will be notifying the health department."}
{"text":"De'lish comfort food - have heard how good this place is, so finally decided to give it a try. Big menu and lots of choices. I started with the mushroom stuffed ecargo, & it totally hit the spot. Next I went for the maple glazed scallops served on a bed of kale & brussel sprouts. I am not a big kale fan, but this was so good. We will so be back!"}
{"text":"The new location still has the quaint family feel. Good selection of interesting beers.  I went at lunch on a weekday and I was the only one there, so the service was great, but they also had no one else to take care of.  Even the chef came out of the kitchen and asked me how my meal was. 
From previous visits to the old location I can say that the subs are interesting and delicious. Some of the combinations that sound odd are definitely more tasty than you'd expect. If you want to branch out and have your taste buds pleasantly surprised, check this place out!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! My Husband is from Europe, and this is the best place to get your Euro fix. I am GF and the schnitzel was outstanding. If you are GF this place is for you!! The Owner was very nice and polite. 
I had the Gluten Free Viking and my Husband the cordon blue. I can't say enough how good the gluten free Viking is. Thank you Beaver's Choice for making authentic and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious, fresh, and homemade. Very friendly family owned restaurant. Especially enjoyed the gravlax and pork schnitzel with mushroom sauce. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Holy Moley!! This is a place you cannot miss when in town!! From So. California, visiting and had dinner here. The owner was so sweet and friendly. The food was AWESOME, flavorful, and lots of it! Polish isn't my favorite but this place changed my mind. You want a great polish restaurant, this place won't disappoint. Everything was fresh and hot. I will be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Defiantly worth trying. I loved the Swedish meatballs....We will be back soon"}
{"text":"I went with my family, I had already eaten but tasted a bite of everyone's which was all different! Everything was fabulous and the owner who served us was delightful! We will all definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here. The food was fantastic. We decided to try the Combo Plates so we had a variety. All items are made from scratch and fresh. It may take a little longer to get your food however it is worth it. If you have a large group you will need to make reservations and be patient. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Large portions, we brought enough home for 2 more meals. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I came here for the very first time for the 3rd get together of the International Supper Club UYE. I am told this is their new location. It just opened 3 weeks ago and it is very nice. Open and bright. Color changing lights under the bar. Cool pictures on the walls. Very nice glass tables.

I was one of the first to arrive in our group. I was going to hang out outside until more arrived but upon finding out there was a bar I hightailed it inside. I was going to order a beer but was a little dumbfounded by the beer selection. No beers on tap just all import beer. I like import beer and am willing to try new things but I had never heard of any of these beers and didn't know which one to pick. Plus my budget was a little tight so it was probably a good thing that I passed on it. Pretty soon others started to show up and when the majority of us were there they showed us to our table. Water, silverware and menus were pasted out and good conversations were started. Looking over the menu I again was at a lost as to what to get. I was told Schnitzel was the thing to have. Upon further study of the menu I see that the Chicken Cordon Bleu Schnitzel was toted as their signature dish. Well First time at a place you should try the signature dish so the decision was made. I also wanted to try the Poutine, french fries with brown gravy and cheese curds, but again the budget was tight. Something for next time.

Our waiter came out an introduced himself and he and another waitress helping out took the food orders. Each taking a side of the table. The owner's son also came out and introduced himself and gave us a little history of the place. He let us know if we had any questions about the food to ask him as most of the staff was new and didn't quite know all of the menu yet. After a little wait a few apps came out. Others had ordered the Poutine. I looked at it across the table jealously. The food took a little while to come out. It seemed longer with no bread or anything to munch on while waiting. Others have mentioned long waits for food with large groups and our group was 13 strong. But dishes started to come out slowly. Apparently each waitperson entered their orders in a different POS terminal and they were having problems with one of the terminals so one side of the tables orders came out first. It was not a big deal and my side of the table only had to wait a little while longer to get our food. The other side's food looked and smelled very good.

Finally my food came out. You get to choose 3 salad options and one side with each entree. I picked sauerkraut, garden salad, potato salad and french fries. Everything was very good. The garlic vinaigrette for the salad had a very good flavor and the mushroom gravy on top of the Schnitzel was the perfect accent. With a little sauerkraut mixed in it was even better. Even the fries were piping hot and dipped in the gravy were approaching divine. I give more credit to the gravy on that point.

The whole evening was very good. Everyone had a great time. Much thanks to Monica O. and Ursula D. for putting these UYEs together. There has not been a bad one yet. The owner even came out and introduced herself as well. With a bandage on her face from having a procedure the day before she was still at work hustling around. The staff and the owners were all very nice. I don't come over to this side of town much any more but I will definitely be back here. I only gave it 4 stars this time as they were still working out the bugs after just opening 3 week ago but with a local place you expect a few rough edges that is one of the reasons we like them. A future visit might bump it up to 5 stars. I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"It has been a REALLY long time since we have enjoyed a meal as much as we did tonight! To call it just a meal doesn't even do it justice, it was an adventure in dining ! 
The food is amazing but the people make it even more so !!!! Trust me you do not want to pass up on eating here!!! 
Oh yeah and can you say all you can pierogies on Thursday nights for $10.95!!!  
Try it ... I guarantee you will not be disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"Wow - we just had a great meal here.  The food was fantastic, everything we ordered was unbelievable.  This is a sit down, relax and enjoy the night restaurant, so it did take awhile.  But we had some great beer and appetizers while we heard the cook staff pounding the schnitzel, so we knew everything was made to order and was going to be good.

Our food finally came and we all dug in.  We had a party of 5 at at the table (a family of 3 and 2 grandparents) and we all said, almost at the same time, oh my god you have to try this.  So we ate, passed plates and forks full of food around the table and loved every bit of it.  After we got done eating, we ordered 4 desserts to share and pass that around.  Everyone had a different favorite, so we were all happy.

After our meal we spoke with the owner who took us on a quick tour of the kitchen so we could thank the cook staff, it was very cool.

The only problem is that we are on vacation and can't come back very easily.  If we were closer, we would be regulars here all the time."}
{"text":"oh boy. nothing, i repeat, nothing is vegetarian. i ordered a sampler of side dishes and dessert. service was warm and charming, but ridiculously slow. the owner came out and talked to us and said they had someone call in sick, so that was understandable. my dining partner said his food was bland. probably won't be back although i desperately wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, we immediately noted the absence of any rustic Euro feel or vibe whatsoever. It was very generic, lacking character. The owner greeted us by thanking us for coming in instead of \"going to Prescott\" as business was slow for her.  When we sat down and ordered, the waitress informed us that they were out of the first 2 beers which we had picked, She then showed up with a pick of her own  which was completely opposite of what was requested.  She then gave the disclaimer that \"she was not good with beer\".  Clearly she wasn't good with food either as she had not a clue about the menu options or what dishes contained as she had to keep going back to ask the owner.  The server did note that they were also out of the potatoes which we requested. (Strange, for \"slow business\" they were certainly out of a lot of standard menu items.)  The last straw was when our hot \"ethnic\" meals were delivered and the sauerkraut was cold and RAW.  This is something that should be listed on the menu or explained by knowledgeable staff.  The lack of atmosphere, along with unavailable menu items and cold raw sauerkraut made this experience quite opposite of what was expected. The meat and potatoes were acceptable at best. Paired with an overpriced check, this experience finalized the decision that it was the first and last tine we will visit this establishment."}
{"text":"Last night my son finished 8th Grade so he got to pick where he wanted to go for dinner. I held my breath dreading the answer, then he said Beaver Choice. Yay. One of our family favorites. 

The name tells you this will be something different. A polish, Scandinavian, Canadian restaurant. Eclectic is a good word for it. Yes, the variety of choices make it a favorite, but that is on top of the very friendly staff and the family atmosphere. But most importantly, the food is good. 

We started Canadian, with poutine. French fries, gravy, cheese curd.  We almost came to blows and the French fries disappeared. 

I had their signature dish, the cordon-blue schnitzel. Pork. One son had the chicken. It was cooked perfect. And the sauce was great.  It came with fantastic potatoes and a salad made of all sorts of good and tasty stuff. 

The wife had Swedish meatballs on pasta.  So good.  And son 2 had an Eastern European pasta, Lazanki. Bacon, sausage, sauerkraut, onions and a fantastic goat cheese.  Sooooo good. 


This is our third time there, we have not had a bad dish. The Swedish sampler I had last time was fantastic. 

Also, they have a great selection of Eastern European beer.  I like my craft beer, but once in a while a real maibock from a 300 year old brewery is perfect.  


Don't be afraid of how different it is, try it. They have something for everyone. Even burgers and a nice selection of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The owners could not be more happy to ensure a good dining experience. As they just moved in the last few months to the location off Baseline Rd, they are working out how to serve a larger crowd. I went last night and boy the food was as good as it gets. My husband and Ihad the Herring plate, Captain's fish, Holsteiner schnitzel and crepes for desert. You just can't get this anywhere else; I did drive from Tucson to check them out. If only I could because my food although did take some time getting to the table, was so good we ordered the Herring plate after our meals came out, because the food disappeared and we were still hungry. I really want to try the Flying Jacob dish, but with a notice that it will take 45 minutes to prepare, I need to find just the right timing as I have to drive home after an hour and 45 minutes. We started eating ordering at 730 so it was too late to invest in that dish.....but how i'm now wishing.......Check out Beaver Choice, the owner Hanna likely will greet you,chat with you, and let you know she's personally going to make sure you get good plates of authentic Scandinavian fare that meet her standards."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised....I love Polish food and it's hard to find in the valley.  I took a recommendation and gave this place a shot.  The meal portions were good - you get a choice of 3 sides.  I had the Polish combo platter (unfortunately they were out of Polish sausage on our visit, which was a bummer).  The pierogies were very good, and while they cabbage rolls were decent, I have to say that they were rather small.  Had much better at Polish Fest.... and, of course, in Krakow.  

Liked the fact that they had native Polish beers.  Their Black Boss Porter was very tasty.  

Friendly service, clean environment....I'd go back."}
{"text":"Up until this point, I had lived 26 years without ever trying Scandinavian food. It wasn't until this past weekend that I ventured out and tried something different. Beaver Choice, as the reviews suggest, definitely didn't dissapoint. I took a chance on the schnitzel and fell in love immediately. My girlfriend, ordered the meatballs and also loved it. Without a doubt, this place has great food at reasonable prices.

If you're looking for something different I highly recommend Beaver Choice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stopped by here today because I'd been wanting to try it.  The first time I came they were still in the middle of construction, but I spoke briefly with the owner and vowed to come back.  I was not disappointed!  You come in and seat yourself, which I enjoy because it makes everything feel a little more causal.  Almost as soon as we sat down Rebecca came over to greet us and take our drink orders.  I got the mango green tea and loved it!  

Rebecca was very attentive and patient while we pondered our options, and even after I changed my order at the last minute she was still so nice!  I KNOW how annoying it is when people change their orders--I've worked in the food industry myself, and stuff like that always made me want to scream.  Rebecca though, she was all smiles.

At one point it seemed the owner was on her way over to us, but my BF and I were in the middle of a conversation--I think she noticed, and decided not to interrupt.  That level of consideration is unheard of in restaurants.  So often the owner of a place goes to table after table after table, totally oblivious to people's conversations or intimate moments.  I understand the importance of interacting with customers, but it's equally as important to give people space, too.  I know some people get offended if the owner isn't grovelling at their feet and spoon-feeding them; as for me, I'm secure enough to know I'm not the center of the universe, and that if I need anything, I can get up and ask.

Now, the food.  My boyfriend got the bratwurst off the lunch menu, and the bun was grilled!  We love that.  I didn't try it, but he said it was good.  I got the meatball sandwich with a side of beet salad (OMG).  The sandwich was delicious, with the perfect amount of dressing (it was like a tzatziki almost).  The bread tasted like it had been baked recently--crusty on the outside but warm and chewy on the inside.  And the beet salad, wow.  I love beets just boiled and plain.  These were cubed and dressed with sour cream, but best of all, they were PICKLED beets.

Let me set something straight right now: I am VERY Germanic.  I LOVE PICKLED FOOD.  Sauerkraut, herring, beets.....just, yum.

Oh, and my sandwich was HUGE.  I had to take half of it home.

When Rebecca came to pick up our check, I asked her where the radio was broadcasting from.  I know some Norwegian and could understand a bit of what they were saying, but had a feeling it was a Swedish station, and Rebecca confirmed it was.  Then we had a lovely little chat about doppelgängers and Thailand.

Overall, this was an amazing experience.  My boyfriend and I will certainly be back again!

Side note: when we got home, I realized that I'd made an embarrassing mistake.  I like to leave little doodles and fun notes when I go places, for people to find.  Today I had my trademark little bird guy saying \"I love Beaver Choice!\" in Swedish, but I misspelled the word for \"love.\"  That's been bugging me all day."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You must appreciate made to order, authentic food!! The cabbage rolls are to die for. The schnitzel cordon bleu, pork or chicken, is amazing. Swedish meatballs, poutine... Try it all! We have yet to try something we don't like! Not to mention each item usually comes with FOUR different sides. This is the best Scandinavian food in the valley!!"}
{"text":"Very good food. Small place, orders take a while to come out, but that's because they're made fresh and you can taste it. If you want some delicious unusual food that's well prepared, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My Mother and Daughter and I went to Beaver Choice for lunch.  We arrived at 2 o'clock.  They made no mention of the fact they were closing at 2:30.  We ordered, waited (a lengthy wait) for our food and began to eat.  About 8 minutes later a young man comes to the table and offers us boxes, telling us we MUST leave since they are going to have a meeting! WHAT? We just spent 25 dollars and we are being kicked out?  We tried to scarf some food quickly (my Mother is elderly and cant really eat in the car) as they were pulling the food and napkins and drinks off of our table.  This had to be the rudest experience EVER in my 42 years.  The food was NOT great and they charge extra for ANYTHING, like 50 cents to add mayo, without letting me know they were adding an extra charge for mayo.  WE WILL NEVER GO BACK!"}
{"text":"Very good schnitzel, thin and lightly breaded. The staff is very friendly, and we had a pleasant chat with the charming owner after dinner."}
{"text":"I ate here on a Sunday afternoon and was impressed by the food quality, very friendly service, and speed of service. On the strength of other Yelps, I had the gravlux with dill mashed potatoes and tomato basil salad. All excellent as others have said. I had broccoli and cole slaw as my other sides. The broccoli was tender without being overcooked and the slaw was a pleasant vinegar-based, not creamy, variety that complemented the rest of the food nicely. The food filled the plate without being overwhelming and I found room for one of the Beaver cookies, actually two large waffle-wafer cookies with a lightly flavored lemon cream between them. The cookies are kept in a chilled pastry case, probably because of the cream filling. A pleasant meal on a hot summer day."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never been to this place before. I love love Scandinavian food and I've had it in other states before when traveling and never thought to seek it out here in Mesa where I've lived for almost 17 years.

The food: It was surprisingly good! My friend had the chicken cordon bleu schnitzel and I had the pierogi meal. It was so incredibly scrumptious and the portions are very hearty. It was just under $60 including a 20% tip for 2 waters 2 hearty meals and a dessert. 

The atmosphere: when we showed up the place was half empty and it felt like we were the most alive in there. I was actually worried Bc it was so empty. I think we were the youngest people in this place. Which I suppose is typical for much of AZ. It's not one of those young hipster joints. A family owned business by the nicest people. It was clean and they have cloth napkins for silverware which says upscale but it's very casual. 

The staff: They were attentive and made great recommendations on the food. I was super tired and reserved which is abnormal for me but I still felt so welcomed. My friend and I literally camped there for 2 hours just catching up on life."}
{"text":"There is thia cookie sandwich thing that is so good. The two outside \"cookies\" are made of different grains, but its the inside cream that is so good. The cookie is pretty sweet in general, but the tart creamy middle makes this very addictive. Okay enough about that awesome cookie. Their side salads are so good. You typically get 3 with your meal. And get the potato salad for sure. Overall Yummy!"}
{"text":"It has been probably two years since I have reviewed on Yelp. But this one I could not let go!!  I am writing this while waiting for our friends meals to arrive. 

Excited about the reviews at this location and opportunity for different type of food. 

On arrival, restaurant was only half full. We stood at entrance for over 5 minutes without being greeted. Finally one waitress told us to select a table anywhere. A few more minutes to get menus.  Something similar to another review. 

We were told by first waitress that our waitress would be with us.  And that she was new. 

Waitress came. She was very nice.  She made great efforts.  We ordered....  THEN everything went downhill. 

My girlfriend and my order arrived. But our friends order did not.  Were told the other orders would be out soon. NOTHING. 

New waitress came out and apologized. Said she put everything in together. Did not know what happened?  She would look into it.  Came back 15 minutes later. Said she must have not entered it in computer correctly. Our friends orders have been moved to the top of list. Said our friends will be comp'd dessert. NOTHING. 

We watch many orders come out to other tables. Still NOTHING. 

15 minutes go by. Older waitress came out. Mom of our new waitress. Said she does not know what went wrong. Everything was entered correctly. 

My girlfriend and I have finished our meals.  Our plates are cleared.  FINALLY our friends order arrives. 

My girlfriend, being much more tactful than myself inquires about comping our friends meals. Points out that our entire table dinning experience has been ruined. She says she will check with owner. 

Waitress comes back. Said they will not comp meals.  Offered them free dessert. 

Food was ok. Tried to wait initially when first meals came out. So by time I started my meal it was cold and less than desirable. 

HINT. Good service is part of the dining experience!!  Not bringing out meals together made the experience horrible.  Our experience was a huge FAIL!!   There is no incentive for me to want to come back!!  

If you have two hours to kill you might get lucky. But I won't come."}
{"text":"Uh okay, so this was weird.

I had a modest group of 6 and convinced them that going to this place I read about on Yelp would be a good idea. I don't have time (and you probably don't either) to self-indulge in a long review about my personal life and how I experience every intricacy of this place I visited.

The bottom line: Food is good, portions are large, service is flawed. They are really nice people who were recently overwhelmed by a spike in popularity. Now I think they can't take the heat. We took about 45 minutes to receive our food. One of our members got his food about 30 minutes before the rest of us. Kind of bizarre because the place was practically empty about an hour before close. They ran out of some food items.

I'm very good humored and usually don't give a hoot about my server being incompetent, or screwing up something important, or even punching me in the face...but this was really annoying. While the food was great, I won't be going back. My friends DEFINITELY won't be going back. They are all cheap so if you're a cheapskate, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Love this so much that whenever anyone asks where I want my birthday dinner, this is it.  Went for lunch just after their grand opening. The new place is beautiful and you still get to see Hannah running the show.  The day we went, there were a few staff issues and then the computer went down. If you were there at the same time, fyi, this is not the way Beaver Choice runs, so don't let it stop you from returning. 

I'm with Michael C., love the Swedish meatballs, my companion loves the chicken schnitzel.  I didn't see any anchovy laced burgers on the lunch menu this time - guess I'll just have to go back and check later!"}
{"text":"I kept driving by this place wanting to try it, but finally went last night for my Dad's birthday. We had a dark haired chipper waitress who even though very busy, tried to make our stay pleasant. The owner's son who is Swedish (accent and all) was very helpful and took a moment to discuss the language with us as my grandmother was Swedish.

We ordered Elk served over potatoes, chicken with a pineapple/chili sauce and Swedish meatballs and schnitzel. All of it came in nicely sized portions and was super tasty. Be ready to pay for these lovely dishes though. Not too spendy, but higher prices.

Why I didn't give a 5 star: We sat in the corner booth, which has wooden seats, that started to cut into our legs. I would suggest you sit at a table with cushioned chairs. I also thought they needed to maybe have one more employee to take up  the slack."}
{"text":"I have never had Scandanavian food. I had no clue what to expect. But I joined some of my fellow yelpers for the international supper club and boy am I glad I did. The food was fantastic. 5 stars all the way. The reason I still gave it 4 stars is that they seem to be experiencing some small growing pains and service is a little slow but they were very friendly and accomodating. I am sure they will get this worked out and it will be a 5 star experience soon! I can't wait to go back and try more menu items.  I had the Jaeger Schnitzel..? I am probably really spelling that wrong but it was so yummy. The sides were all really good as well. I had the dill potato salad...So much flavor. Tomato basil, saurkraut, and cole slaw were all really good as well. Great compliments to the meal. Everything that the other party members had looked good too."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant!! Everything we had was fantastic! Hanna is very personable and I can't say enough how amazing the food is!! Must go!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent-- 4 stars.  Service was terrible--0 stars.  Timing between all of us getting out main dishes was 15-20 (i.e. none of our main dishes came at the same time).  BTW, the name of this place is not great and from a marketing perspective, does not make sense."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an excellent Scandinavian/Polish place, look no further! (They even have a dash of Canadian influence as well.) I am a sucker for Schnitzel and the Pork Jagar Schnitzel is my favorite (pork pounded then breaded & cooked topped with brown mushroom gravy when served.) Seriously AMAZING, my description does not even come close to explaining the wonderful flavor explosion that this dish is! The portions for dinner are large, plus with your dish you also get to choose 4 side dishes total. I like the Creamy dill potatoes, Potato salad, Homemade coleslaw and Pickled beets. For the Canadians out there they serve Quebec Poutine (I recommend the large for the table to share as an appetizer.) They also have hand made Pierogies (yum!)
All in all i have not been disappointed in anything i have ordered here. I love the new location (much larger and nicely decorated.) The staff is super friendly, even when they are busy they are very courteous and attentive.

P.S. They do have Gluten-Free options."}
{"text":"OMG awesome.  I found this place on line and could not be happier.  People were great.  Food was everything promised.  I would totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"It was really hard for me to decide what to rate Beaver Choice, which is why I didn't write anything after only the first time going there. We have been there on three separate occasions now and have had very different experiences each time. The first time that we went in it was just me and my fiancé. He had browsed the menu and had been wanting to try it for months so we went. Well, we were seated at a table, however a server never came to ask if what we wanted for drinks or for our meal. After waiting for over 15 minutes we simply got up and left.

The second time, my fiancé had suggested a few different restaurant to his parents and they wanted to get Polish food, so they chose Beaver Choice. We warned them that the service is terribly slow, but we went anyway as they insisted on it. Our service, as expected, was not good, however overall, we had a good dining experience. We ordered quite a few dishes including the Regular Chicken Schnitzel, Chicken Vladimir, and Swedish Sampler. The portion sizes were massive as the main menu item was served with one warm side dish and three side salads of our choice. Everyone really enjoyed the food.

I was actually the one who wanted to go back a third time (technically second) to Beaver Choice. It looked like there have been some changes made, because all of the servers were different this time. Although I wouldn't say it was a huge improvement, I would say that it was quite a bit better than the last time! We were greeted immediately after we entered and were told we could sit at any table we wanted. Our server brought water to our table but it took a while for her to come back around to take our order. I liked the Regular Chicken Schnitzel enough the first time that I actually got that again with the dill mashed potatoes, house salad, potato salad, and broccoli. My fiancés first choice, the Salmon Lasagna, is apparently not available until September (not noted on the menu), so he got the Hunter Chicken Schnitzel with the garlic-leek smashed potatoes, green beans, potato salad, and broccoli. Unfortunately, the food wasn't as good as we remembered it being the last time, however overall still good. I will say that the chicken schnitzel here is better than I have found at other places. The sides on the other hand were just okay.

Our waitress did check in on our food (after I asked) and let us know that it was coming, but that they have only two cooks and it takes a while since everything is made from scratch. Our whole dining experience took nearly two hours; because the food is good, I would be willing to come back here, just not frequently."}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing! We love this place it's so worth the wait. Quality people and phenomenal food!"}
{"text":"All your wishes will be granted at Beaver Choice. Last night a friend and I saw a fine fine movie. Afterward he recommended going to this Scandinavian restaurant that just opened a week ago. It's a small place located in a strip mall with ample parking. First impression. Wow there is a lot of Ikea furniture here. Second impression. Wow these people are really really nice. You order at the counter from a pretty large selection of menu options. There are two menus (that they are happy to explain to you). The \"grab and go\" menu with things like sandwiches and wraps and a \"bistro\" menu with more hot dinner-type options. Immediately, the owner asked if I wanted free samples. Sure! I ordered the Pork Tenderloin with Morel Cream sauce (I love morels!). My dude friend had the Swedish Meatballs. We sat on our Ikea chairs at our Ikea table and enjoyed ABBA softly playing in the background. I admired the Outsider Art for sale on the walls. I almost wanted to buy the painting of the woman holding a baby. The woman looked like one of the Olsen twins. Neat! The little free samples were yummy. I had a little bit of gravlax with dill sauce, beet salad in sour cream (amazing), potato salad and some kind of lemon mousse thing. All very tasty. My pork schnitzel with the morels was so delicious. It came with salad, coleslaw and mashed potatoes with the same cream sauce. I think that mushroom sauce melted my cold cold heart. It made me smile. Then we ordered the lemon mousse thingy. I said to my friend, \"I wish Dancing Queen would come on. Then everything would be perfect.\" When dessert came we were invited to eat it on their comfy sofa. Yeah, sofa. Then Dancing Queen came on. Wishes do come true."}
{"text":"First thing: patience is key. They were a little swamped, down a waitress, and had system issues slowing down the food process. Believe me, it is worth it. The food is AMAZING!!! We were here two hours, but the owner was very kind and apologetic. We were in no hurry and understood. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Sometimes, it is just wonderful to be alive.  Actually, all the time it's wonderful to be alive.  Life is amazing, the weather is gorgeous outside, I am or think I am getting better at tennis, my girlfriend loves her job and I love that she is bringing in money for the first time in 5 years, 3 years later I can finally convince myself that bright red is not too girly a color for the car I drive, and I found a restaurant that serves food so good that I want to photoshop some incriminating photos of the husband so that I can court the owner-chef Hanna, marry her, and keep all her food to myself.  As that would be a terrible thing to do and that I don't think I'm really spouse material and that I have no game whatsoever, instead I will eat here whenever I think I deserve an amazing meal and spread the word on how awesome Beaver Choice is!

On to my actual experience, I start with a phone call asking general questions about their restaurant, and engage in a nearly 8 minute dialogue analyzing what I like and ordering based upon their recommendation.  This also creates a 10% discount by ordering over the phone for pick up off their bistro menu, which is nice for my lunch hour.  I wound up picking the Chicken with Cardamom
sauce, perfectly seared slices of chicken then simmered
in cardamom accented, heavy creme sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked, with the seared outside giving a pleasant mouthfeel, yielding to the moist and tender inner portion, all swimming in that wonderful sauce.  You can choose a side dish and 3 portions of salad to go with your entree.  Couscous was heavenly, absorbing all the juices of the chicken and mopping up the sauce in its fluffy goodness.  Tomato-basil salad was fine, but too peppery.  The spinach salad was straightforward and competent, and home-made coleslaw was tastier than most I've had.  Very filling and extremely satisfying, I would bathe in that cardamom sauce if I could.  

One note I need to make, a previous review had slammed Hanna for tasting something she was making, and using the same spoon for tasting something else.  When I arrived I mentioned I heard about them on Yelp and mentioned this review, which prompted resulted in me being ushered into her kitchen to proudly display a set of about a dozen spoons at the ready for tasting.  Also of note there are no microwaves!  The pride in their food is entirely justified, yelpers.  The only thing to be aware of is the time involved to prepare your food, but ordering in will alleviate that, or simply set aside plenty of time.  

Choose Beaver Choice.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I just had a fantastic experience here. We came on Wednesday, which is all you can eat Pierogi! Then our friend had a birthday and they sang to her in Swedish! Great place, wonderful food, exceptional people. Try some Scandinavian here."}
{"text":"Food was so good it earned 4 stars by itself. Service deducted a star. It took 20 minutes of awkward waiting in the middle of the dining room before we were seated. No host/hostess to speak with, and there were plenty of open tables. Another 10 minutes after being seated before a drink order was taken. 

That being said, food was amazing and I'll give them another shot for that reason alone."}
{"text":"Now I'm not one to leave reviews or rate places. However this place is wonderful. The restaurant is clean and open. The owner was very polite and attentive to all of the guest in the restaurant.  I had the pirogies, my father had the stuffed cabbage, we both loved our meals. Fresh delicious food with great portion size. I will definitely be back and recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"I had a ball here. The staff is just a family that loves making their special food for you.

It is different too. I've never had anything like it and I don't know anywhere else in town that has something this different. But then again, I might not get out much! Ha!

Get here now!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!  I had the Swedish meatballs and wow!, they were good!  The picketed beets were fantastic too (and I'm not a beat fan).  Mashed potatoes were lovely especially with the meatballs and gravy.  So much yum on my plate!  Definitely going back!  Move that you get so many sides with your order!"}
{"text":"What a tremendous evening! Trying to decide where to eat on a Saturday night we did a Google search for Best Restaurants in Mesa. When we looked at the menu and saw pirogis we were all in!!

The food did not disappoint! Wonderful pirogis, cabbage roll and Polish sausage.  In a wonderful finish to a great evening, the owner Hanah took us back into the kitchen to show us the amazing pirogi machine.

Truly a wonderful experience!! We will return soon!!"}
{"text":"Polish culture always have great taste in furnishing comfortable atmosphere. This place says a sleek all the way. Inside or outside the place is roomy, great for family invites. Polish country know their vodka and this place has a bar that has pulsating cool color changing lights, good to mention polish ladies carry them self well. Fast service and the food came out fast. I ordered the cordon-blue, salmon burger, and a bunch of sides but no pierogies (none till next week...?) I enjoyed the food but have no credit due to my knowledge polish/Swedish food."}
{"text":"Still get 5 stars. Went back again yesterday for some of that Poutine. Glllrrrbbbl. Had a hard time coming up for air once I started eating. Susan had 6 perogies and enjoyed. We love this place. They are planning to move in January or February to a new location in Mesa. Fortunately, they will be even closer to us :)

We really need to take some of our kids there so they can sample some of this Scandinavian/Canadian cuisine. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for. You can't find this stuff on Denny's menu (or any other local restaurant?).

Beaver Balls are next on my list to try."}
{"text":"Prices are high for a lunch menu. Server did not offer drinks. We both got the wrong orders so things did not start out well today. The saving grace was the schnitzel sandwiches were very good. We liked the menu at the old location better. Sometimes really good restaurants try to \"morph\" into something bigger and better and lose their character along the way. I hope that's not the case here."}
{"text":"Talk about comfort food! Its not the kind you get at home, but definitely makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. I had the pork cordon bleu schnitzel with dill mashed potatoes, tomato basil salad, sauerkraut and spinach salad. The pork was thin with a delicate, slightly golden, crispy batter. Once you cut into it, there is just a slight ooze of cheese, not too much, but just enough. You can't go wrong with mash potatoes, but these were uber good with the dill. All of the salads were just \"okay\" to me and they balance out the creamy pork and potatoes. I still give it a 5 because the specialty is the main dish."}
{"text":"My grandparents came to this country from Sweden and so my expectations were very high.  I was not disappointed. The food was fantastic and the flavors were very close to my childhood memories.  The service was good and attentive without being overbearing. The gravlax was perfect and the sauce was thick and rich.  The Swedish sampler box was wonderful.  The meal was really two meals worth.  The serving was huge. My wife enjoyed the schnitzel and my daughter liked the perogies.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The mushroom gravy is amazing, the schnitzel was a bit greasy, and they wee out of the first 3 menu items we tried to order, salad was a bit over dressed, the dumplings were great ... Decent meal!"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and decided to write my first of many commentaries.  It was authentic home-cooked food, made with love.  Sounds corny, but if you spend much time on the road, it's not worth guessing by judging a book by its cover.  And this strip mall appearance would normally just result in a drive-by.  You would never even see it set back from the road.

Had the herring appetizer which was awesome, and the swai filet.  It was buttery and soft, as you might expect.  The side dishes (kraut, cole slaw, beets, potatoes) all had a very original flavor and I liked most of them...a few were kind of heavy/creamy (the beets) and dill is used often - but that's what you mostly expect from cuisine from this region of Europe.  Gave 5 stars for the overall experience - food quality, price, quantity, ambiance, service, and love.  As Hanna (the owner) said about running this restaurant, \"You have to love it\".  And everyone there does, including the many regular customers.  I'll be back again Hanna.  So you can call me a \"regular customer too\".  Take me to a family run restaurant like this anytime, and I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"First time having Scandinavian food, everything was excellent. Will return soon."}
{"text":"I can sum up Beaver Choice in one word: bland. The food was bland, the decor was bland and the service was less than enthusiastic. My husband had the schnitzel and I had the Shoe Maker's box. The schnitzel was thin and the gravy was very disappointing. The Shoe Maker's box was a bit more flavorful because of the leeks, but again the gray was bland and the pork loin was very under seasoned. If you are looking for a flavorful, exciting dining experience, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience....the food is unbelievable ...the owners are so sweet .. Down home comfort food at it's finest can't wait to go back many times to try everything on the Menu..."}
{"text":"My Dad is 100% Norwegian and I took him there for late lunch we all loved it friendly family owned and amazing home cooking.  A must to try"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the area. The food is unique and delicious!!!! Their beer selection is fantastic (a lot of European beers)! The family who owns the restaurant is super friendly and nice. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"So delicious!!!!! The pierogies , Swedish meatballs (be sure to ask for the lingonberry jam) and schnitzel are absolutely amazing!!! They also have a fantastic selection of beers, cider and wine to top it all off. Come with a big appetite!"}
{"text":"Went here during restaurant week.  I think the staff may have been a bit overwhelmed.  Service was on the slow side but still friendly and good.  Slow service is what made me go three stars.  Willing to try again though because....the food!   Brought smiles and joy to my Polish heart.   I got pierogi, elk stew and their house special macaroon desert.  Girlfriend got different pierogi, pork and coconut chocolate layer cake.  The flavor a brought me right back to my Granny's kitchen when I was a little kid.  The pierogi are legit.  Spot on.  I wish they had kraut but they had run out.  The pork was well cooked and flavorful.  The elk stew nicely seasoned with just the right hint of gaminess to remind you it wasn't beef.  Girlfriend loved the cake.  The macaroon whipped cream orange tower of deliciousness was perfect.  Best desert I've had in a while.  Looking forward to coming back and trying their golumpki!"}
{"text":"We were searching for comfort food and a quiet spot to visit with friends. The menu the menu reminded us of our Canadian (prairie) cultural roots, and it did not disappoint.  The owner was there eating with 'her very first customers' and, everyone was friendly and server was attentive. 
Will meet up with friends and eat there again when in city!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was incredible. The food was amazing, and it felt very authentic! I ate until I couldn't, and then ate the rest of my leftovers as soon as I got home. And again for breakfast. We got the sampler plate, schnitzel, and some great beers. Can't wait to return. Craving this again as we speak..."}
{"text":"All I can say is spectcular! We came the night after they were featured on television and like most reviewers previously complained about it was packed....TOTALLY WORTH IT! We ended up sitting at the bar and Tom (i believe that was his name) was friendly, courteous, and attentive.Seriously some of the best food we have ever had! Though there was a small wait the food was fresh, well flavored, and delish all around. We ordered perogies (half potato bacon and cheese, half mushroom), chicken picata, and cabbage rolls. For dessert we got the ultimate beaver and like everything else it was superb. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"The pierogies are almost as good as my grandma's! I had the chicken schnitzel and it was very tasty. I loved the dumplings!  I went with a group of people and everyone enjoyed their food. We shared the custard and the rhubarb crumble. The only complaint is that my sister made reservations and they had no record of it. Thankfully they were not busy. I would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"After dining at Beaver Choice tonite,  I decided to read a few reviews before writing mine.  Incredible how many people experienced lengthy waits for their food.  We waited well over an hour for our entrees.  The owner explained that two chefs called out sick from out of town (apparently enjoying the holidays) but that wouldn't explain the other reviewers who had similar experiences the other eleven months of the year.  The food was all good.  My wife and I both had the Jager schnitzel.  The sides, especially the beets with horseradish were very good as well.  One reviewer who ate there a month ago said they were out of Polish potato dumplings.   Well, they're still out of them.  The wine list is small, inexpensive and unimpressive.   There are no beers on draft.  The best part was after we left and I discovered I left my VISA there.  I returned only ten minutes later and the owner didn't seem to remember me.  Then she suggested that a lot of people \"think\" they forgot to take their card, implying that maybe I left it somewhere else.  To make a long story short, it was still in the waitress' pocket.  The owner doesn't know how to run a restaurant and we won't be back.  If I want a great schnitzel, we'll just have to return to Germany or Austria; they know how to cook and serve."}
{"text":"I had preconceived notions about Scandinavian food, I was forced wrong.  This place is freaking amazing.  Just good food. I tried the 3 course meal. Amazing perogies. Try getting the jalapeno cheese ones if you can. Schnitzels are excellent too. Try the meat sample plate if you are really hungry(definitely worth the value) 
Love the place. Coming back here again soon."}
{"text":"From the moment you walk in the owner is there to greet you like family. You feel instantly welcomed as the staff is friendly and wants you to try everything!

From the beginning they let you sample a free pierogi or two. Just to get you ready for the home made meal to come. While you're waiting for your food, the owner might come by and invite you into the kitchen to see what she's coming up with behind the scenes. 

But this kind of friendly service it's just the tip of good things here. The food is like your mama's kitchen. Simple but really really good. There are a great number of interesting things from all over the world. The owner has brought a little bit of every home she's had to this restaurant, and it really shines through the menu. 

That being said, the star of this place is the pierogi. No matter how you get them cooked, they're perfect every time and taste better than any dumpling you've ever had. 

Don't let the naysayers who review this place poorly fool you. This is a gem of a restaurant. Small in size but huge in heart. Expect a wait when you get here though. The place can get a little crowded, and the food is made from scratch so it takes time to cook. But it's worth the wait every time."}
{"text":"This is a fun family owned restaurant to go to when you are craving some delicious Scandinavian Food with a Canadian twist. Been to their older restaurant several times before and this newer location is both nicer and quite a bit larger.

Came to the new location for my son in law's birthday lunch. He loves this place and so does my wife and daughter. My wife is of Swedish descent and a big fan of this type of cuisine and nothing too spicy. Trust me there is nothing spicy here.

Service was very friendly and most helpful when it came time to order. Started off with some Gravlax for an appetizer and a tasty Beet Salad that we all shared. They were both really good and got us in the mood for more. Hungry!

Ordered the Elk Stew which sounded really good. There was very little Elk meat on the dish and it seemed to be mostly mashed potatoes with a mushroom gravy and some small sides. My wife went with the Swedish Meatballs with some veggies and more mashed potatoes. There was only 6 meatballs and they were very small. It was hard for her to share any of them with the rest of the party.

Daughter order a Cardamom Chicken dish with veggies and mashed potatoes. The sauce was pretty good and had some nice flavors. Birthday boy ordered a Pork Belly dish off the specials menu. It looked really tasty and had a fried egg on top of it and all of that on top of ... wait for it ... more potatoes. My 15 month old granddaughter probably enjoyed the food the most. She was unable to resist catapulting small pieces of beets with it's purple juices across the room and onto the floor. Ha!

They definitely have the flavors down here and a very nice menu. Would like to see more protein on the plates and the cost of the dishes reduced down to a reasonable amount. Fifteen to twenty bucks per plate for lunch portions is a little steep in my opinion. Maybe it was just too much potato per square inch.

Give them a try and see what you think. It could be that they bit off more than they can chew with this new location. The rent here is probably double or triple from what they were paying at the last place. Sometimes keeping it simple is the best way to go. Now only if they actually severed ... BEAVER!

3.5 STARS"}
{"text":"First off I must say the folks that run this family owned and operated restaurant are by far the friendliest restaurant owners I have ever met. All the food is homemade and really does taste like the food your Grandma would make. I highly recommend the Chicken Cordon Bleu. Unlike a regular cordon bleu made with Swiss cheese, the folks at The Beaver make theirs with brie which adds a unique twist on a classic. A very rich mushroom gravy sat atop real mashed potatoes as the side. Make sure you ask for a sampler plate and for all the Abba fans that swear this group was Sweden's greatest export you will be very happy to know that Abba always plays in the background at this place."}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for a culinary adventure, this is a worthy destination.  They have an extensive beer menu (mostly Eastern European) as well as numerous cocktails. 

The poutine is good.  I don't know that it's the best poutine I've ever had but it's good.  The gravy tastes a bit cheap so perhaps that's my hangup about it.  The chicken schnitzel is divine.  Well prepared with a tasty sauce.  The potato salad is also some of the best I've had anywhere.  I'm not so much a fan of the green been or basil/tomato salads.  The rosti is delicious.  

It's clearly a family owned restaurant that is run with care and that alone makes me want to return."}
{"text":"I walked in 15 minutes after opening and I was treated like family. The waitress as friendly and lovely as my mum and the shoemakers box a fresh cooked, homemade and awesome dish. 
I wish, I had a restaurant like this in Chicago. There is no need for a TV in there. Just enjoy the food and your companies."}
{"text":"A full count for tonight's UYE International Supper Club! It was my first time trying Beaver Choice and Scandanavian food, nothing better than an authentic local restaurant to do both. After much deliberation I went with their signature dish, Chicken Schnitzel Cordon Bleu, made with french crème brie cheese, smoked ham, and topped with a side of porcini mushroom gravy, melt in your mouth goodness. It came with 3 choices of salad and a side dish, such a deal and a party for the pallet. I had the green salad(plain but refreshing), tomato basil(burstng with flavor) and the beet salad (which I know doesn't sound delightful considering it's beets) it was blended in a cream and was almost like having a tangy dessert, loved it! For my side dish I chose the savory pan fried potatoes with thyme, yum! I appreciated that two of the owners came to out to offer their assistance on answering any questions, and asked for ways they could improve, a nice personable touch and all the more reason to enjoy eating local. Great food and service!
I'll be back, I still need to try the bacon and goat stuffed chicken, and let's not forget dessert!!!"}
{"text":"You have to try this place! Try the Swedish sampler, its amazing. Deserts were amazing as well. The Lemon Fluff was to die for and the Beaver Special was wonderful. Even my kiddos loved it all!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible Central Euopean food, from Sweden to Poland. And I come from a European family. Not fast because it's all fresh, the value is incredible as everything is huge."}
{"text":"My wife was searching the 'net looking for a Scandinavian restaurant in the valley and found this place so we went.  I'm glad they are close by.  The menu has SO MANY CHOICES.  Also a nice selection of imported beers that are hard to come by.

The service is great and they are very knowledgeable about the menu.  The pierogies are fantastic!  The elk stew is another favorite.  The seared Gravlax is another good meal and is generous in size.  Not sure where to start?  Try a Swedish or Polish sampler plate. 

For dessert I highly recommend the Beaver Supreme, Swedish crepes (FANTASTIC), and the lingon berry ice cream.

The only thing I would change?  Move them closer to my house by restaurant row on Gilbert Road.  I guess it is better for me that they are tucked away in a strip mall with weird stores that people don't go to as I can always get a table right away.  Maybe they are best kept as a secret?"}
{"text":"Came here Saturday November 11, 2017. Let me start by saying that this was a shocking experience and this is a long review
WHAT HAPPENED:
My husband & I took our Vietnam Veteran uncle out to dinner to celebrate Veterans Day. We came in at 7:00pm, and ordered food and drinks, at around 7:15 their 2 beers came to the table but my wine showed up at 7:30.Our sever was working hard and running all over. When she came to our table with my wine she apologized and said \"sorry we are just really busy.\" They had 9 tables at this time and there were 2 servers on a Saturday night. By the time we left there were 11 tables (including ours). 

WE ORDERED:
- Canadian Poutine (appetizer)
- pierogi dinner w/ salad & sides
- Swedish meatballs w/ salad & sides 
- pork schnitzel w/ salad & sides
- wine & beers

The awful poutine came out 15 min after I got my warm white wine. It was burnt fries swimming in salty gravy & melted cheese. We ate it b/c we were hungry. After 45 min from when we ordered,our food still didn't come out, yet 2 other tables that sat after us got food, Weird. 
The first time we asked about our food the server said we were next up. But then we watched 2 other tables get their meals. 
When we'd had enough we tried to get our waitress's attention but she wouldn't come over. Instead we had to ask the waiter to please get us our check for what we had so we could go. My uncle needed to eat & take his meds and nothing was offered during our wait.We needed to go get his food and our server was kind of avoiding us. Most likely because the food was taking really long. 

All of a sudden the owner, angry elderly woman, comes storming to the table from the other direction & slams the check on the table yelling at us \"pay your bill, get out, and never come back again!\" NO LIE, can't make this up. She starts yelling at us & my uncle tried to explain that we've been waiting 45 min and he needs to eat and the server came over and said it's only been 35 min b/c she didn't put the order in till we got our appetizer. But the appetizer took 15min, so that's 45-50min. My uncle didn't eat any of the poutine because he had no idea the food would take so long and he was saving his appetite for the dinner. 

Then, the owner went to the guests next to our table and started talking crap about how we couldn't wait for our food. She was storming around the restaurant making a complete spectacle of herself by yelling and we were just standing there to pay for our bill so we could leave. It also triggered an anxiety attack w/ my uncle & he had to go sit in the car while we tried to pay the bill, we asked to pay it 5x. 
I finally spoke up after watching her parade her anger out in the open to try to calm her down saying \"please stop yelling as no one else is yelling & we just want to pay our bill\" in a de-escalating tone. She then yelled at us \"you come from McDonalds then go back to McDonalds.\"  I'm not even sure what that means? Because we were done waiting 45-50 min for food and my uncle needed to take his meds? She wanted us to get out so we finally just walked out and tended to our uncle. 

WHAT COULD'VE BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY:
- instead of storming over and slamming the check down she could've come over and offered to bring our salads out to eat before our meals, offered us bread, came over to talk to us
- clarify the situation: server said they were super busy and the owner was yelling at us that our wait time was normal.We were puzzled by what \"we are super busy\" meant for a Saturday night on a holiday weekend as we didn't have a wait time to get seated. 
* we would've stayed had the right solution been provided by her. But instead she chose to go ignorant crazy on us. 

PROS:
- they serve pierogis
- they have beer and wine
- our server was great

CONS:
- based on the poutine we had the food was ridiculously priced for what they were offering. 
- expensive place to eat, rip off
- verbally abusive, disrespectful, and inappropriate behavior of owner in the establishment. I was so shocked that she was okay with treating other people like that. 
- triggered an anxiety attack with my uncle due to staff behavior. 
- operated unprofessionally 
- whole design/decor is outdated and doesn't match the menu prices. Only cloth was our napkins. A booth outside had 1/2 the fabric ripping off. 
- one server had a tight white shirt on and his black pants were super tight. During the time we were there we saw him adjust his underwear in the restaurant because his pants kept falling down, they were too tight for his figure and he had no belt. He looked a mess

* Not only will I never go back but I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Delicious!  The chicken cordon blu schnitzel is wonderful.  Totally worth the resulting food coma."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I went there with 5 others (parents, sister, brother in law, and wife) a few weeks ago due to the reviews it had received on Yelp.  Well, the name caught our attention as well.  

The food is different than what you will find anywhere else in Phoenix but anyone with a somewhat open mind about food will be impressed.  The standouts were the chicken schnitzel cordon blue, the laxpudding, seared gravlax, and the cabbage rolls.  Be sure to save a little room for the Beaver Supreme for desert.  Yum!

The star of the show though is the family that runs the place.  This isn't a super well oiled corporate food machine but it is like going to some friends family dinner.  The timing of the dishes wasn't perfect but it worked out great since we were all able to try each others dishes.  Everyone one of them make you feel welcome and appreciated which goes a long long way in a valley of restaurants with either non-caring staff or staff with attitudes.  

All in all, the food and family are great and they make you immediately feel welcome.  I wish them much success."}
{"text":"I drove 45 minutes from Happy Valley to try this place out, and it was worth every minute. The people who run the place are almost as amazing as the food they serve. We tried the Poutine, Crab Cake, Schnitzel, and my favorite the Cabbage Rolls (freakin' amazing). To top it off dessert consisted of 3 \"Beaver Balls\" and the \"Cookie\" Sandwich. I'm not one for coconut, so I didn't try the Beaver Balls, but my friends loved em, and the Cookie Sandwich was a great way to end a phenomenal meal. The entree's come with a side, along with 3 types of salads of your choice. I can not WAIT till they open their 2nd place a bit closer to central city, BUT in the meantime, its worth the drive from North Phoenix for a little taste of Scandinavian/Polish heaven!

{"text":"You can find my review from my first visit under their first location. For some reason the reviews did not follow, so here is the \"update\".

Food - As good as it gets. From the Poutine to the Cabbage Rolls, and ending with the French Press Coffee and Strawberry Crepes. Everything I have had feels authentic, tastes amazing, and the family that runs the place is flawless.
Hanna Gabrielsson is your mother away from home. She greets you with the most warmth and love of any restaurant owner I've met.

I stand by my original review which I'm going to paste below. The new place is beautiful. The location, size, and staff are par with the atmosphere Beaver Choice has created. I drive over 30 miles each way to eat here, and I will make that drive over and over again. I will do it for the family, for the fun, but mostly FOR THE FOOD. Original review below.

{"text":"Hidden jem! Come hungry, because its a ton of food! The chicken schnitzel get it, love it, MmmmMm. Also try the lemon cookie, its pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"This was one of those dining experiences for me where I was just wowed. I immediately wanted to come back again and my partner decided it's his new favorite Mesa restaurant. 

We started with the pan fried perogies (a mix of the jalapeño and the bacon ones). They were extremely delicious & the homemade sour cream was perfect on the side. 

For dinner my partner order the Viking schnitzel (pork). It was a burst of flavor to the taste buds. Everything was seasoned perfectly and the schnitzel crispy. The sides: tomato mozzarella salad and arugula salad very tasty. The marinated green beans were good, but probably not a future choice. The potato pancake was essentially crispy hashbrowns. I ordered the scallops. They were divine. Cooked perfectly and the little potato dumplings they sat upon.. I wanted more. 

For dessert we shared their special dessert... Meringue with fresh whipped cream, mandarin oranges and walnuts. The perfect sweet light end up the meal. 

This is definitely somewhere I will return."}
{"text":"Strange name but absolutely awesome food! First time since I left Germany that I've had Snitzel this amazing. Definitely sole food level."}
{"text":"Quaint and quirky is what comes to mind when I reminisce on my visit to Beaver Choice. The tables, plates, and furniture are all IKEA (of course). The large and rather gaudy window paintings visible from the front add to the offbeat vibe of this place.

On that note, this place could use Gordon Ramsey... desperately. It appeared extremely unorganized and the menu options are way too complicated; basically you order your entree and it comes with a side (some sort of potato) and three salads. Although I liked the variety, it was completely unnecessary and I'm sure it made things more hectic in the kitchen than they need to be.

Which brings me to the service, you order at the counter and sit and wait for your food. Our food took at least a half an hour. it arrived and it was room temperature.

That being said, you're probably wondering, \"why the four stars?\"

The food was on point, flavorful and fresh. I had the pork meatballs and they were very well accompanied by a kind of dill sweet and sour sauce. It tasted like my norwegian grandma that I never had made it just for me.

I would recommend this place if you're feeling like something different."}
{"text":"Incredible, delicious traditional food, and amazing quality. The owners were wonderful and kind, too. We will be returning, for sure."}
{"text":"This place has some of the most amazing food in all of Phoenix and they also have delicious deserts we asked them to custom make a small pastry into 4 full size deserts and it turned out amazing."}
{"text":"I'm happy I can get my poutine fix when I find myself craving it, too bad it's served as an appetizer coz it's a little too small. Anywho, I've been here a couple times but this was my first time in their new larger location. The overall atmosphere, the service was quite slow though, I guess don't go there when you're really hungry, or else you're gonna be cranky! The stuffed mushrooms were good and greasy and the pork loin had great flavor. I had the pork schnitzel for my entree, and it was delicious, loved the green bean side, and the potatoes. There were so many flavors that I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. The portions were more than substantial as well but I made sure to only eat half because I had to keep room for dessert which was the Beaver Supreme. I read somewhere that it's regarded by AZ Republic food critic, Howard Seftel's one of the top 10 desserts in the Phoenix area and I can see why. It's made up of two whipped meringue wafers and in the middle is a big dollop of fresh whipped cream with mandarin orange slices. It's a simple, light dessert and I'm not a big fan of meringue but their's was delicious. It can be messy to eat but worth it. My overall dinner experience was great, I was stuffed and will return, for poutine and the Beaver Supreme. ;)"}
{"text":"Great meal! The food here is fresh and \"easy on the body\" as mentioned on their website. I can see why Beaver's Choice food was chosen to be served at Nobel Prize Banquet."}
{"text":"I gave one star because the waiter was exceptional.  The food was like chewing on a rotten beaver.  I Ordered Kottenballs (SP?) the polock version of sweedish meatballs.  I received about 7 balls the size of a marbel.  EVERYTHING was served cold.  The owner stopped by the table and inquired about the food.  We told her the hot foods were cold and she merely left--no offer to warm up the food or apologize.  Never again Beaver."}
{"text":"Gotta love a Scandinavian restaurant that also serves German and Polish food! The food in this family-run business is really good and service is warm and very friendly.  You certainly won't leave hungry, and depending on what you order you may be taking some of your lunch or dinner home because the total amount of food you get on your plate is quite generous. My favorites are the laxpudding and the Beaver Supreme dessert."}
{"text":"Second visit here and now I know why it took us over a year to return.  At first owner was pleasant and nice showing off their pirogi machine to my family.  Appetizers meat pirogi with mushroom sauce and stuffed mushrooms came out very quickly and were very good.  Our server seemed to have his mind else where as every time he came to our table to get drink orders or check on us he was busy looking everywhere else which made us wonder if he heard what we said.  We ordered our entrees, Famous Seared Scallops, Jager Schnitzel, Ghoulash, Stuffed Chicken.  All were good until we came to the Seared Scallops they were cold inside.  When we finally got the server's attention he took the plate for it to only be returned with the owner.  She was very very argumentative and kept insisting they were cooked properly and that is what seared means.  She kept touching them and showing me look they are cooked, I touched them and said yes they may be cooked but they are cold.  Well that's how we serve them was what she kept stating over and over again.  She did say they were cooking some more well done ones for me and at that point I told her no thank you.  I didn't want them.  
My family finished with the other items they were okay but nothing that was very impressive or that had us saying we must return soon.  We didn't even stay for desert nor want desert as she had ruined our Friday family dinner night with her attitude.  When we got the bill my husband stated that the scallop dinner was on the bill still.  Her response YOU ORDERED IT
WOW!!  You charge your customers for a meal that they were not pleased with and immediately sent back and did not order anything else to replace it with.  I had 2 bites of a (1) scallop and returned it.  
VERY VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  Also to overhear another table order the scallops and she made it a point to tell him how they are seared and that she just wanted to make sure he knew they aren't hot looking at me the entire time.  RUDE

OVER PRICED DINER FOOD!!  AWFUL DECOR!!  OLD DINER PLASTIC STYLE BOOTHS"}
{"text":"The owner was very friendly and talkative. She asked me whether we learned about this place through yelp. Yeah she knew the answer.

We ordered pierogi and chicken schnitzel cordon bleu, with mushroom sauce, various side salads, and a plate of pan-friend thyme potato. 

I knew nothing about pierogi and it tastes very much like Chinese dumplings to me -- but with a cheesy potatoey filling. So I took my husband words for it -- \"great.\" 

The chicken schnitzel cordon bleu actually reminded me of the KFC double down sandwich (http://www.kfc.com/doubledown/). No offense but I actually enjoyed KFC tremendously as a kid. The concept of Beaver Choice's chicken cordon bleu was quite similar to a double-down: breaded chicken steak with ham and cheese in the middle. It tastes good, slightly on the saltier side.

The side salads were refreshingly clean. I was quite impressed by the cole slaw because in my mind, cole slaw should be simple, not a greyish goo with mayo mixed in. Husband liked the tomato basil salad. The pan fried tomato was tasty too.

A couple notes:

1) It is moving to a new location in Mesa. Good for business I guess, but sad for me because I live right around the corner.

2) Menu is quite extensive. We definitely want to come back and try a couple more things. They know what they are doing. In fact, the background sound to our dining experience was the constant pounding of the meat from the kitchen. I surely didn't mind hearing that they made things fresh on the spot.

3) Food was surely tasty. The current location was small but very clean and bright (almost has a well-lit fast-food restaurant feel to it). It can get busy, thus crowded, very fast.

4) The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I think the price was a bit higher than I expected. I'm not saying I don't want to spend money on good food. I'm just saying we got another meal after this that night and we are not some serious big eaters."}
{"text":"OH. MY. GOODNESS! The food here is homestyle deliciousness with Euro style. I went back twice in 2wks. It is a small business, owned by a lovely couple who appreciate customers that appreciate quality food. This is NOT Texas Roadhouse. Be prepared to be patient and enjoy the experience. There is usually 1-2 servers and eating here is like visiting a relative who happens to be a amazingly talented cook. Come for the delectable and satisfying food and appreciate the stories. 
I bring my kids here - they do have a kids menu. We've had the Frikadeller w/pasta and Sliders. I had to stop myself from eating all the meatballs from my daughter's plate. Kids even commented on how good everything was. I have had the Polish Sampler and Crab Cake. Their pierogis are amazing both deep and pan fried. The sausage has the snap from the natural casing...yummy! The cabbage roll was my least favorite, but still tasty; just overshadowed by the other items in the sampler. Crab cakes are a good size with lots of crab meat. 
The second time we went I had the Regular Schnitzel with dill potatoes and mushroom gravy. I wanted to drink the gravy from the small ramekin it was served in. Soooooooo delicious and smooth. The schnitzel was perfectly crispy and not dry at all. To top it all off they have a great drink selection, wine and beer. Try the Kozlak - it's an amber with a caramel finish. 
I love this place and the people who run it. A great change of scenery from all the chains in the east valley."}
{"text":"I am in LOVE!!!! This place is deeelish! small, quaint, and delicious. the food was amazing and exceeded my expectation by far! The customer service was awesome and made our visit there delightful :)"}
{"text":"This new location is much bigger and better appointed than the previous one.  The interior is bright and has a variety of seating arrangements - booths, regular tables and chairs, and bar seating. I came at 1:30 pm so that the lunch crowd was mostly leaving, and one of the servers told me to seat myself anywhere I wanted. I ordered the chicken schnitzel with dill mashed potatoes as a side, and since 3 side salad choices also come with the meal, I got the beet salad, green beans, and broccoli. The food was excellent - just as it was in the previous location. Before coming here, I noted that one of the issues from some of the previous reviews is the long waiting time for groups. I timed the length of the wait to get my order; I got my food 20 minutes after I gave the order, which I think is not an unreasonable length of time to prepare the dinner combination I ordered. I also noticed that a family of 4 that came at about the same time I did also got their food at the same time I did. Note, though, that this was after the lunch rush. I guess it takes a longer time to prepare all the dishes ordered by larger groups of people, especially during the peak times of lunch and dinner. After lunch the restaurant closes at 2:30 and reopens for dinner at 5 pm."}
{"text":"The food here feels like I am eat back in Vienna Austria. The food is fresh and very good. Bring the family for a great time"}
{"text":"My husband and I just returned from dinner at Beaver Choice. We may not be authorities on Scandinavian cuisine, but we had an amazing meal prepared by an incredibly friendly family. 

From the moment we walked in the door, the family that owns the restaurant was more than inviting. They took great care and pride in explaining the menu. The restaurant has two menus: a Grab-and-Go menu that has quickly prepared and cheaper fare, and a bistro menu that offers larger dinner plates that are more expensive. The owners even offered us a sample plate (with their cured salmon, potato salad, and beet salad). The friendly service made us feel that we were guests in a family kitchen. 

After some consultation, my husband ordered the Laxpudding. The main dish is cured salmon atop a potato and egg frittata with a tangy dill flavor. I think my husband might become addicted to their salmon. He recommends that anyone who enjoys cured fish, or just fish in general, to locate a means of transportation to this restaurant immediately. In addition, the salmon comes with a tangy dill mustard that just enhances all the flavors. He had three sides with his meal: a tomato-basil salad, a spinach salad, and sauerkraut. All were home-made fresh. 

Being a vegetarian, I was more limited in my selections. However, I am told that the restaurant will offer pierogies in October, and I love pierogies. I definitely plan to return to sample some vegetarian pierogies. 

Beaver Choice has several vegetarian options on their Grab-and-Go menu. The owners explained all the vegetarian selections, and offered to let me construct a plate from any of the vegetarian options and sides. I decided to order their Harmonie plate (for only $5). It is a large plate of home-made falafels with a potato salad and a side salad. The falafels were very tasty, and the potato salad was absolutely fantastic.  

In all, we had a wonderful, home-made, fresh dinner prepared by a very friendly family. My husband is anxious to return to try more of their fish dishes and their schnitzel, and I am looking forward to some pierogies."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I really wanted to try this place! 
But, 3 times you are out!!
 I have attemeped to go to this place 3 times and they are always closed. I mean all 3 times I have driven all the way over there they are closed.
Tonight was the 3rd and final time.
I drove all the way over there Saturday Night 6:30pm. Closed!!
Big Help wanted sign in the winddow, that has been up there for about 2 months, I always see it when I go over there to try to eat here.

Why are they never open??
Why on a Staurday Night are they not open??
I give up!"}
{"text":"OK if you can believe it ,we finally made it here and they were open. It was a Friday night and we called before coming, just to make sure that they would be open.
If you read my reviews you know that i had gone to the one in Tempe 3x's and every time they were closed.

Anyway, here we are. If we did not know what we were looking for we never would of found it.   It is located in a very strange shopping center. So it is not like you would just be driving by and say ,hey let's stop here ,there is a great looking place to eat.

Well, we were seated right away and then we sat. We sat for a very long time. They were quite busy. But, they only had 2 Servers. Plus one bus person.
It was clear they were very overwhelmed. 
They need at least 4 servers and The Bartender should help a bit I think.
He was just standing behind the bar doing a whole lot of nothing while everyone else seemed to be working hard.

It is decorated nicely. We modern Europe for sure.
One of the bus girls that came later explanied some of the terms on the menu ,which we were not familar with and then so did the waiter.
Luckily we had ordered an appitizer or we would of starved for sure.
45 min it took to get our meals. 
We had to flag someone down several times to get drink refills. Other wise we were just sitting there with no food and no drink.

I think the owner should of been going around doing everyones drinks or something. She was going around talking to guests. But, she should be an active part of the serving process as well. When you see your staff is falling behind, you have to help them.
 When the food did come out it was fantastic! I mean truly fantastic.
So that is why I am giving them 4 stars. I would eat there again because, great food is the only reason. 
Please get more help. You need more people working there.

Bathrooms are nice and clean, and there is lots of parking in the lot.

If you bring childern with you, make sure you bring them something to eat and  something to do while they wait for there food."}
{"text":"First I will say, the food was good, but pricey.  I am giving this restaurant poor rating because the service was not good, we were told they were short staffed because a waitress was in car wreck or something.  Okay.  So we wait, wait wait, my husband and I watched 3 tables get waited on ahead of us, yet these folks all came in after us.  Finally someone takes our order, more waiting.   Wait some more to order dessert, wait some more for check.   Check was $146 for 3 people, including a $5 \"convenience fee\", which we find out after the fact is because we used our debit card, not cash.    I was told that the menu stated something about using cash, sorry I missed it.   So, 2+ hours later, $146 lighter and I didn't even have an alcoholic drink.....  could use one now though....    We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I saw Beaver Choice profiled a long time ago on Eden Eats and always wanted to try it.  I was driving to work one day and drove right past the new place, and was so excited.  It is literally 3 minutes from my house and about 5 minutes from where I work.  Heck, I even emailed the owner to ask when it would be open.  And got a very nice email back too.  

So last Saturday, me, my daughter and my friend went in and got seated right away.  The waiter was pretty good too.  Good start

We got the fries with cheese and gravy to start.  It was ok, but most importantly, fresh, and hot.  Then our dinner came, and it was a different story.  

I got the stuffed chicken, mashed potatoes, salad and cole slaw.  My daughter got a hamburger, medium, and salad.  And my friend got meatballs, mashed potatoes and cole slaw.  The mashed potatoes were cold.  My daughter's hamburger was well done, and the bun was ice cold.  The dressing on the salad was tasteless as well.  Not horrible, but definitely room for improvement.

So we have cold food and an incorrectly cooked meat.  But you know what the clencher was?  We called the owner over and told her the food was cold.  She didn't say a word, and walked away, never to return.  Didn't offer to reheat the food, maybe throw in a dessert, nothing.  But she was sure greeting people with hugs when they walked in the door, prior customers I think.   You'd think she'd work a little harder to keep new customers.  After all, wasn't that why she moved, to expand her business?

Guess what?  I live close, and also work at a very close and large office building.  We go out to lunch a lot.  You better believe I won't be back, and won't bring any of my friends and coworkers in either.   There's never an excuse for poor customer service, especially by the \"OWNER\" of the restaurant.  A waiter, usually nothing to lose.  The owner has everything to lose.  I hope she reads this."}
{"text":"First, the food - it is good. The food selection is unique for the Phoenix area and generally it is pretty good.

So here is why 2 stars - customer service is lacking. We have gone several times, and always- always - there is a service problem, either they are \"out\" of certain foods, or they completely mess up the order, or something. The last straw for me came when we had a reservation, arrived 1 minute late (thanks to unexpected traffic) and stood for 5 minutes waiting for service - only to be told accusingly \"You're late. I gave your table away.\"

I won't be going back, but if you are willing to deal with the rather consistent inconsistent service, and the customer-is-never-right attitude, then its worth a try if you haven't been there before.

But be warned - DON'T BE A MINUTE LATE if you have a reservation."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last week and we were very pleased with the food. The service was just a tad slow but not too bad to deduct a star. I ordered the Chicken Cordon Blue Schnitzel and my husband ordered the stuffed cabbage roles. Both were very tasty, but we both agreed the the schnitzel was just a tad better. For dessert we ordered the fruit filled crepes with ice cream and that was delicious. It does get busy in there and I would recommend making a reservation on the weekends."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I just did not like this place. The staff was very friendly. But the food. Not to my liking. My BF enjoyed his burger. The fries with gravy were OK, but didn't have a lot of flavor. I thought everything was pretty bland."}
{"text":"Just go here, now. I really mean it.....go.

Real Scandinavian folk, homemade and insanely good food.

Be prepared to wait a bit for your food. Each dish is made to order so enjoy some good conversation in the mean time."}
{"text":"Beaver Choice is an excellent place which I have had the chance to visit three or four times.  This is about as home-cooked as you can get in a restaurant.  It's like eating at Mom's house, if Mom happens to be Swedish.

I've had a few of the entrees -- schnitzel cordon bleu, pork medallions, seared gravlax -- and all were delicious.  Especially the gravlax.

The sides are also great, and you usually get three per meal.

The poutine is perhaps not as good as what you'd get in Quebec, but it's easily the best I've had in Arizona.  The fact that they even have poutine wins this place a few points.

I have also had the opportunity to try their dessert specialty, the Beaver Supreme.  This mess of chocolate, meringue, cream, mandarin orange, and possibly a few other things, is the sort of thing which you set out intending to only eat half in the first sitting, but ultimately find your free will diminished, invariably resulting in an empty dish and a fear of the onset of diabetes.

Also, it seems one gentleman gave this place low marks for the long preparation time on a chicken wrap.  I just have to ask, why would anyone go to a Scandinavian restaurant and order a chicken wrap?  Can you imagine what would happen if you wander into a Viking camp and order a chicken wrap?  Your head would be off before you could recite one measly Odinian incantation."}
{"text":"Such a cute place with awesome food and service.  

I went here for lunch with my mom and it was a great experience.  We were warmly and enthusiastically greeted, and the boy working was more than happy to fully explain how the menu worked and any item on the menu.  
We played some cards while we waited, and every person working there seemed to be upbeat and happy.
Food was great and there was a TON of it.  So yummy.  I'll be ordering takeout soon I think."}
{"text":"Delicious  home style Scandinavian food but they have a little bit of everything. The schnitzel is amazing! Lovely husband and wife run the place. Will be coming back, a lot!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't say Scandinavian is close to the top of my list of dining choices. So please, take this with a grain of salt. The dinner meals were about $15 each ($20 with tax and tip). This certainly surpasses the upper end of what I like to spend on a casual meal. Add a drink to that and you're headed to low $20+. The meals are larger than one person needs - but not quite large enough for two; the wife and I shared, but both left a bit hungry.

Everyone in the family appears to be lending a hand somewhere here, managing, serving, cooking, seating, and so on. The food itself I found to be done well enough and everyone there made you feel welcome and appreciated, like a member of their own family. I couldn't be happier with the service itself, and again, I wouldn't consider myself an aficionado when it comes to Scandinavian, but just about everything on the menu was fried, potatoes, or fried potatoes, so dieters beware. With that nugget of wisdom, I'd have preferred something not quite as fried.

Happy Yelping Phoenix. (err Tempe)"}
{"text":"So good! Crab cakes and Swedish meatballs with a Beaver Supreme- chocolate ma range with thick whipped cream and Mandarin oranges, so light and perfect!"}
{"text":"Wonderful owners who are very friendly and the food is awesome. Took me back to Sunday dinner with my grandparents.  I'll always stop here when I come to town on business.  A new favorite."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Went for restaurant week and we were so impressed. Everything was well done and portion sizes for every course were enormous! Reasonably priced. Service was a bit slow, but it was worth every minute of waiting! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is now one of my favorite places in Tempe.  It is definitely a hidden gem.  Don't judge this place by any other criteria than the taste and quality of the food, although my pork tenderloin could have used a bit more seasoning (salt).  Just, honest, fresh, tasty food.  Menu options that will satisfy many food preferences including vegetarian and gluten-free.  And, it will not leave a huge dent on your wallet.  Don't expect service to be comparable to \"pro\" run restaurants.  It is a very small (seats less than 30) independently owned and, I believe, family run.  They are very friendly and accommodating.  Leave your pretensions at the door and you will have a great experience."}
{"text":"If you want to experience home cooked meal look no further. Helen's recipes are out of this world. Her husband and her are such incredible people. I found this restaurant on yelp and was completely satisfied. Our server was Allison and from the moment we walked in until the moment we left she was extremely attentive and extremely informative to my boyfriend and myself. The ambiance was so great. Everyone must try this restaurant. Your stomach will thank you for Helen's home cooked recipes. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This friendly Mom & Pop restaurant was exactly what I was looking for - casual, a great value, and complete yumminess outside the realm of typical restaurant fare. Definitely give it a try, and don't forget the dessert!!"}
{"text":"I went to Beaver Choice when it was in its Tempe location and today decided to take my mother to the new location in Mesa. The new place is beautifully decorated and Beaver Choice is no longer the dive of yore. Every time I've been I've found the staff friendly and attentive. The fact that it's a family owned and operated establishment is not lost on me. 

Today's problem was partially my fault. The waitress described the pierogi plate to me, so I assumed it was one of their lunch specials. I ordered the dish, opting for half mushroom/kraut, and half cheese/potato, with the beet salad,  spinach salad, and green bean salad. My Mom chose peas off of their salad list, assuming it was a pea salad.

The pierogis were tiny. I enjoyed my salads, but my spinach salad contained no spinach and was instead mixed greens. What mom though was going to be pea salad was merely cold peas. She told me they tasted like someone had allowed peas to thaw in the fridge and then served them. She offered to let me try them, but I declined. The sauerkraut was also lackluster and may have been canned.

I would say that the biggest disappointment was the check. We both felt that 13.95 was a bit much to charge for this dish. I admit this was my fault, as I should have asked the price. The next time I go for lunch I'll stick to the sandwich menu.

I've been on other occasions and really do like the schnitzel and stuffed cabbage."}
{"text":"Yet another great place I would have never found without Yelp! It's not about atmosphere here. Its about wonderful food, generous portions and one of the nicest proprietors I've ever had the fortune to meet. She treated us like gold. She allowed us to sample ALL her salads and made up a special plate of them for our family to share instead of making us choose three for each entree. It was a simple thing, I suppose, but we really appreciated that she was willing to accommodate our indecisiveness. :-) I wish we lived closer. I could imagine making Beaver Choice a regular haunt. She told us that she loves Yelp! Ninety percent of her new customers come to her because of Yelp and she's won several awards for Beaver Choice, but she's most proud of her Yelp award. She'll be moving to a new, larger location soon and is looking forward to adding a bar where you can drink from large horns."}
{"text":"The Beaver is an incredible value!  Four Stars in our opinion. 

But uneven service and food brings down the overall rating just a bit.  We really liked the experience and the family run atmosphere.  The owner comes out and greets you and also checks in a very transparent, sincere way. Nice!

We felt the food had a very Germanic/Scandinavia flair to it, or maybe it was the seasonal Octoberfest items on the menu. Lots of wurst, Swedish meatballs and of course their signature Schnitzel. But sadly, no Perogies, Stuff Cabbage or Kielbasa.

We had the Schnitzel and the Chicken Cordon-Bleu, with a glass of Weiss beer and a Riesling. Both were good, but the Chicken was bland and not flavorful.  As I mentioned at the outset, the service was disorganized. Our tab came to $59 including taxes, but before gratuities."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place.   Even if you are not fond of a certain type of food, Chances are you will like it here.   I hate beats and thought the beats with sauce was quite delicious.   Normally not big on vinegar and enjoyed the vinegar dressing.   

The meatballs (both kinds)  were almost as good as I make at home (which you just can't beat). I just kind of mixed everything together with some of the dumplings and my girl friends jager chicken.  Would order it all again! 

Enjoyed it all so much we ordered the poutine?  (fries,  cheese curds and gravy)  to go.  I am assuming I am going to like this too.  

You should eat here,  it's friggen awesome."}
{"text":"The name alone just begs one to try it out. Once inside you are greeted by some of the nicest people who ever existed. The meals are ram a lama delicious and the location is not too far from a hookah bar. The Swedish meatballs are a must but everything on that menu wants to be devoured.  Great place, good food. I recommend taking friends. Because eating alone makes you feel off. Well, it makes me feel off."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! On our way to a show at the Mesa Arts Center, we stopped at Beaver Choice. A nice cold glass of white wine, poutine(our first time ever!) and yummy schnitzel! I'm a girl who lived in Germany for 6 years, so I love this type of of food!
I had 3 side salads with my schnitzel, and the cool greens of the slaw and green salad gave a nice contrast to the warm, rich gravy and potatoes. We took home pierogi because they were yummy and I think they sell them by the dozen.....home made and delish for lunch the next day. Next time I will have dessert....I hear they have German style Apple tart. We will certainly make the drive again and bring friends."}
{"text":"What a great little spot! I don't often eat Scandinavian food, but that might all change after today. The family that runs Beaver Choice has charmed me with their delicious food and friendly spirits. I can agree with some other reviews and say that the food did take a good amount of time to get served, but Beaver Choice has heard that cry and they are trying to work on it (Also, when I ordered off of the Grab & Go menu, I got my sandwich very quickly). 

The lady and I ordered a Swedish Meatball Pita and the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon Bleu to share. The food knocked the socks off anything IKEA had to offer in it's cafeteria! The pita was loaded, and I mean loaded with fresh veggies and about three meatballs per half. For a mere $5, that's a steal for a sandwich that doesn't make you feel like you just ate a grease-soaked sponge. Now, make sure you go before 6pm if that sparked you're interest because they switch to the dinner-only menu after that. What about the schnitzel, you ask? Yum! It was basically a flattened cordon bleu covered in a very nice mushroom sauce. Every bite was very tasty, but there is a pork variation that I wish we would have gotten. Apparently the owners put the chicken version on the menu to appease non-pork eating individuals, so the pork is the original for them. Along with the schnitzel there were a few different salads (all of which were fresh loaded with crisp red onion) and a side of pan-fried thyme potatoes. I want to just eat a big bowl of those because they were that good to me. They were simple, light and flavorful.

Beaver Choice. Remember that name and go check it out! It was good, but be patient. They are new and they'll get their groove thang going soon enough. Lastly, make sure you write them a review! I know I can't be the only one to be excited about multiple \"schnitzel\" references in a single review!"}
{"text":"They nailed exactly what they are trying to do hear with Scandinavian food. Problem is that it's not the right genre for me. Poutine was lights out though."}
{"text":"This is the second time we've been here in a week.  All I can say is yummmmm. Hubby tried the 'shoemakers box' last week and the 'rhubarb chicken' tonight. He recommends both. Last time I had the 'polish sampler plate', tonight was the 'schnitzel cordon bleu'.  All meals were sooo good and if you come to this restaurant I'm pretty certain you'd be very pleased as well as full!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my! I am a native Swede and grew up in a restaurant environment, culinary schooling in France, worked all across Europe and now happy in AZ. As one might imagine, I'm overly picky with foods and atmosphere while I critique down to the plate and table the food is served on. Apart from all the fancy or fast foods, there are those mom and pop restaurants that I love to visit, that bring you unobstructed home cooked meals from heart and soul with a simple thought of celebrating indigenous concoctions worthy of you and me. Without explicit mentions, this place is true to the latter as it looks, feels and tastes just like home, wow. The owner welcomes guests personally, without the overhead, in either Polish, Swedish or English; an impressive personal touch! If pricing is the concern, fear no more as contemporary Scandinavian cuisine, often times invites you to explore by the pound in addition to select menu entrées. A good serving of blissfully palatable delights lands around $8-10, however bestows neither limits nor restrictions should you choose either extreme. My suggestion however, walk in with the intention to experience very lightly spiced and herbal foods, genuine \"Swedish Meatballs,\" true \"Polish Links\" or \"Cured Salmon\" that are very mild in flavor but are genuine to the spirit of North European summertime meals. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I first visited Beaver Choice on a whim a few months back when I was searching for something new to try. I called in on a Friday night and ended up ordering the Swedish-cured Salmon Sandwich following a recommendation from the person over the phone. I am thrilled that I made this choice and thoroughly enjoyed my generous portion of excellent cured salmon. In the weeks to follow, I returned twice more to Beaver Choice, each time ordering a new dish. The Chicken Cordon Bleu was fantastic and lived up to all of my expectations, while the Laxpudding was just as savory and delicious as was described to me by the son of the owners. I feel fortunate to live in such close proximity to Beaver Choice and I absolutely love every single menu item I have sampled in my many visits. They are exceedingly friendly, open, and honest when meeting with customers. Anyone who complains about service or wait times has only themselves to blame. If they tell you over the phone that the wait could be at least 90 minutes, they mean it! That's the result of every dish being made on the spot and to perfection. They do not cut corners and they do not deviate from recipe. I have nothing but good things to say about this establishment. Their desserts are likewise delectable and the cooks are always willing to allow you to sample a dish if you're indecisive about anything (ex: my girlfriend had never had a swedish meatball and wanted me to order some, I simply asked one of the sons if it would be possible to sample one and they included it with my meal without so much as a second thought and no charge). Upon my next visit I MUST try their Lemon, Herbs, Olive Oil, and Pink Pepper Marinated Salmon as I have yet to be fortunate enough to visit on a date when they have not completely sold out of this menu item! I cannot wait for my next meal at Beaver Choice and I suggest anyone/everyone give it a try if you truly enjoy delicious, homemade food."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, very interesting menu with many many choices.  Price was decent, only complain might be the place is a little too small and gets busy very quickly.  In fact, go there at opening time to get a seat and get served fast.

Keep up the good work of trying to introduce a new taste to the SW."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.Yum.Being a Pole from Chicago, I definitely know good Polish food-AND I miss it since having moved to Az.
 We found Beaver's Choice purely by accident-reading Yelp, and decided to give it a go.OMG!
 Hania the owner makes -everything- herself- and it is to DIE for; we had the herring appetizer[ delicious, smooth, silky ,the BOMB], and then the salmon platter[gravlax] with a variety of salads and dill potatoes, as well as the pierogi platter.Fabulous, juicy ,tender, delicate, amazing. it was just like being home again.The staff are super friendly, courteous, and kind, and the food came super fast!
Desert was their famous \"beaver cookies\", and you simply -have- to grab a couple to take home with you.
 All in all, an amazing dining experience, cannot WAIT to go back.=)"}
{"text":"This place is simply amazing. Fantastic, friendly staff. Food was beyond amazing. I had the shoemaker's box; mashed potatoes were full of flavor, pork was great, and even the potato salad was amazing. Their schnitzel was authentic and delicious as well. Great drink menu with lots of beer and wine choices. We also had the beaver supreme, which was meringue, whip cream and mandarin oranges. That dessert was huge but totally worth it and extremely good. The crêpes were also amazing. It is somewhere everyone should go to step out of the box."}
{"text":"As a former customer of the Tempe location we finally stopped at the new location in Mesa. First impressions are always important and we were blown away with the décor .It's simply spectacular.  If you had the opportunity to dine in the Tempe location you must go to the new one. Talk about night and day!  Great new menu with an amazing beer and wine list too. The bar area is awesome and the barmaid was very nice and informative. 

Susie our server was outstanding and covered the specials and was very knowledgeable about the menu. She was very friendly too. Great addition to the staff. 

I finally had the time to try the Flying Jacob entrée and it didn't disappoint one bit. My Polish wife enjoyed the stuffed cabbage. Everything was great! Food was prepared in very reasonable time and presented beautifully.  With all the sides we waddled out with bags of leftovers and a smile on our face.

Last but not least Hanna, Chris, and her family are still the same sweethearts that they were before. They just beam with pride over the new location and should.

Try it you will be thrilled as we were."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill since the last time I was here. I came here for the pierogi buffet on Thursday and it was not good. A lot of the pierogi was sticking to the pans and ripping open.  And every time I come in I wonder why they don't have sauerkraut pierogi or mushroom, and I over hear them say it every time someone asks \"that they just haven't figured out how to make it not soggy\" but that basically leaves you only eating potato pierogi... Broken apart pierogi at that.

Also you're supposed to get soup and a salad, the salad was left out without ice underneath it, and the huge soup crockpot was empty. 

Service was basically non existent, and there were literally 5 tables, and they don't take Amex now. I don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"It was such a disappointment when I went to Beavers Choice restaurant for Girls Night Out. I have been wanting to eat there for a long time. We had a party of 6 and waited 45 minutes and never were acknowledged that we were there. No water, no drink order and when we addressed the hostess, I believe she is the owner she informed us that they can't see our table from the bar and that our reservation was not until 7. She gave us a table for a 6:00 reservation that was a no show. She made several excuses why we were not served yet and pretty much told me to go sit down and I will get served when they get to us. There should have been an apology and drinks gotten right away, even an appetizer on the house. They lost 6 potential future customers, but they are so busy I guess loss of business from all of us doesn't matter to her. I do not recommend them, no matter how good the food was, treating customers rudely is no excuse. I don't recommend them at all."}
{"text":"Third visit, eating my way through the menu and haven't been disappointed yet!  It's worth it just for the awesome sides and salads, but everything is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Such a unique and tasty dining experience in the Phoenix area!  We had heard so many great things about the restaurant that we had to stop by and check it out.  

First off, we loved that they offered 3 different Lithuanian beers...such a nice surprise since some of my husband's family is from there and it's hard to find anything Lithuanian in the States.  

We started with the steamed potato and cheese pierogies and they were quite good...especially dipped in the porcini mushroom sauce.  We shared chicken schnitzel cordon bleu and the cabbage rolls.  Both were quite tasty and really filling.  We tried broccoli, horseradish and beets, potato pancake, dill mashed potatoes, potato salad, and sauerkraut as our sides.  I was miserably full when we were done with our meal, but we'll definitely be back to try out some of the other tasty choices on the menu as well as dessert.  There were at least 3 or 4 items that sounded delicious.  

Nothing special about the decor or atmosphere, but that's not what you come here for.  Our server was very helpful and friendly too!"}
{"text":"Every good story has a good ending.  DESSERT first!  Homemade on site so when its gone its gone.  Lucky for us the Rhubarb tart thing was not gone and it was delicious and fresh and had a crumbly top that totally worked!

Schnitzel for the spouse. Devoured!
Pork Belly for me and it was so flavorful and tender like a little hug from back home.

Side dish concept is interesting =  READ the choices and pair with your food for best result.  Beets with horseradish was great to offset the rich meats!

Full service bar was a plus. The menu is extensive and fun! Something for everyone!  FAMILY Owned!"}
{"text":"This place is a great find! The lunch prices are very reasonable and such great quantity and quality (I am very picky with food and quality). They could use a better lettuce than iceberg but that is my only request to change. Apparently, they opened in 2010 and I have been missing out.... missing out no longer. Great food and nice owners and staff. Scandinavian food is on!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food!
As well-traveled Americans, it is always nice to find a place with many of the cuisines we've enjoyed on our travels. It's like bringing a vacation home. 
The food was terrific. We especially enjoyed the chicken schnitzel cordon blue. Everything tasted fresh, and homemade. Comfort food! 
Even though all the staff was very friendly, we felt a bit forgotten by our waiter. We asked to be seated outside after originally being seated inside. We guessed that he continued to be our waiter but forgot about us because we were not in his usual section. 
We ordered an appetizer and our food. The food, all of it, was brought out all at once. I felt a bit disappointed as I would have liked to enjoy my appetizer BEFORE my meal. We felt a bit rushed to eat everything while it was hot! After the waiter brought the food, he didn't check on us for about 30 minutes. We saw him busy servicing other tables inside. Finally, we asked another server if we could see the dessert menu. He went inside and got our server who gave us the menu very quickly as we hurried to ask for refills on our drinks (our only refills the whole meal). 
Dessert. Dessert was amazing! We got the Beaver Supreme. It was big enough for 4-6 people to share! Imagine meringues (not too sweet but sweet enough) layered with sweet cream and mandarin orange slices. Delish! 
The owner was delightful! She greeted customers as they walked in the restaurant. She was very sweet and charming.   
We will give this place another chance. Next time, we will not go on a Friday night. I can't wait to get the dessert again!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. My girlfriend suggested we try this place and decided to visit on Friday. The staff is so friendly there and were so helpful on giving us ideas on what to order. I decided on the Flying Jacob as it sounded really unique and interesting. While it has a 45 minute wait for it to cook, it is absolutely worth it. The flavors in the dish are so different but they compliment in such a way that you actually taste each and every ingredient.  My girlfriend had the Pork Tenderloin Skewers and they were great as well. You get so much food for the money that we had leftovers for the next day. Everything tastes extremely fresh and homemade. If you are in the mood for something unique I really suggest you try this place out."}
{"text":"Over priced, the kitchen didn't have what I ordered and they brought me something I didn't order, didn't ask me and didn't credit me or make any effort to make it up. They also assess extra fees for credit card and don't tell you until you select your tip amount. Good food, but poor service and felt like they were pinching pennies."}
{"text":"I hope they realize how hard it was for me to get here to eat. Between my girlfriend feeling unsure and my friend who isn't into the cuisine, it took a lot of conniving and evil planning to finally have a taste. I was not disappointed in the slightest and was plenty happy with the service. I had wish I got the cashier's name, but he felt like someone you could just hang out with if he wasn't working. It was my first time there and I felt like I'd been eating there for ages! 

Looking at the pictures of the food, I had no doubt that I would love this place already. I had such confidence that I signed up for their membership plan already. Me and my girlfriend both ordered the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu and enjoyed every bit of it. The humor of it all is that she hates mushrooms, but loved the gravy.

Now, despite my rave for the place, I do have a couple minor misgivings. (a brave thing after just giving them my phone number and full name). I ordered some poutine as an appetizer and we both liked it (her more than me). I think the fries should have had more of a crunch when they came out. Before I'm beaten with a tire iron because the fries are coated in gravy, just hear me out. I took a bite off a piece that had no gravy, so I'm not a complete idiot here. Like someone else posted, the canned green beans weren't the best, but the spicing did help it quite a bit. I blame my history of eating green beans out of a can when I was a kid so it was a little off putting for me.

I give it a 4 1/2 out of 5 and I look forward to eating here again.

Gotta go, I got a beaver ball with my name on it!"}
{"text":"Finally poutine done right in Phoenix! I wish this place was closer to my place.  They do a nice job though, friendly staff, overall great."}
{"text":"On Thursdays they have a all you can eat soup, salad and pierogis.  The soup was a wonderful vegetable soup with Brussel sprouts and carrots.  The salad was a Swedish coleslaw and my choice of pierogi flavor.  My friend enjoyed the Swedish sampler plate, but could only eat half of it."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal and I will definitely be coming back.  The hunter schnitzel was amazing and the pierogi's are to die for."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! I came here with the boyfriend for dinner last week and enjoyed every moment of it...

Chicken Cordon Bleu with 4 sides: rosti, tomato basil salad, cole slaw and spinach salad.

Chicken was moist and the cheese and ham complimented it nicely. The mushroom sauce was great, not too salty - loved that. Rosti was like a mashed potato pancake. I liked the crispy crust on both sides. It was tasty with some mushroom gravy on top. Tomato basil salad was light and refreshing. Cole slaw was tangy and not overly creamy-probably my favorite side. The dressing on the spinach salad was good. I think it was honey mustard. 

Schnitzel with 4 sides: pan fried thyme potatoes, tomato basil salad, green beans, and I forgot the other.

Pork Schnitzel was pretty good. Not as good as the chicken but same great mushroom gravy came with it. Thyme potatoes had nice spice and texture. Didn't try the green beans because I hate canned green beans but the BF said it was good. Same tomato basil salad as other plate.

We also got a small poutine to share. I have been craving this for weeks-ever since a friend of mine went to Canada and kept posting pictures of it on FB! Thought it would finally satisfy my craving but only made it worst because now I constantly think about going back for more! It was so good!

We stuffed ourselves silly, but had to get a beaver cookie to take home to try. I was eyeing these from our table and made my mind to get one because everyone was buying 4-5 of these to take home when they were leaving. Needless to say it didn't even make it to the car before we devoured it. I'm a sucker for cookies with almonds!

This is awesome comfort food to the max. Yes, it's on the heavy side so I wouldn't have it often but it's definitely a place I would come to on my \"I don't care about dieting, I'm stuffing my face\" days."}
{"text":"Best Poutine I've had in 6 years, since I was in Ottawa...

I've tried all the poutine in the valley that I've come across and this is truly the first one that got it right.  You would think that D'Arcy McGees would get it right, since they have a chain in Ottawa, but they don't.  Bacon restaurant tried and failed.  Others try to put mushrooms in it, use the wrong cheese, the wrong sauce...

From the fresh cheese curds to the dark brown sauce that Americans can only compare to \"gravy\", THIS is the French Canadian delicacy that I've been trying to fake in my kitchen for years, with shredded mozzarella and a can of imported St. Hubert's poutine sauce.  

Now I need only drive to Broadway and McClintock!"}
{"text":"The rudest wait staff and owner. After waiting 10 minutes at the hostess with no one acknowledging us we were finally sat. Then made to move because that table was reserved. If you want to pay lots of money to be made to feel like your are imposing on the staff this is a perfect place for you."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant.  During busy times the service is slow and the ambience isn't great - but its family owned and run and the food is cooked with such love that its amazing.  The mom and dad cook and the son runs the cash register. These are the nicest people and the food is delicious and cheap."}
{"text":"This place is the best! I've been a regular since their smaller Tempe location.  Delicious home made food. Everything they make comes from real ingredients - meat, veggies, etc. - no weird crap. It literally is like someone's mom cooked your food (and often someone's mom did make it - Hanna is the owner and matriarch of the nice family that owns it). 

The new location is absolutely gorgeous - a great place for a nice meal. 

They are warm and loving to their clientele. If you want a place that serves delicious food, great hospitality, gorgeous ambiance at a great price, go to Beaver Choice. 

All the food is cooked to order. The one thing is that the service tends to be a little slower paced than lets say a place like APplebees or Chiles. But those places serve junk. High quality food takes just a bit longer and its worth the wait! 

Go to Beaver Choice! Try the Schnitzel or Swedish Meatballs (or anything else on the menu). You won't regret it!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food! Love the babcia that's running the place! Guys don't miss out... ALL YOU CAN EAT PIEROGI on Thursday!"}
{"text":"If your a foodie this place is going to disappoint you.
 
On the surface everything appears OK ... interesting, clean & spartan. Friday night, nobody meets you at the door, you awkwardly wait for a table in a half full restaurant with no bus boys or hostess. The bar area is strangely uninviting ... nobody sits there. Wander over to the dessert chiller, nothing special, should have left right then and there. The owner/bartender finally seats us, we order a bottle of wine, decent service. A nice selection of wine & unique European beers. The menu looks interesting, Scandinavian, Polish, German. 

The disaster starts when the food arrives. Crab cake, tiny boring .. canned. Schnitzel pounded to thin with horrible gravy. The sides all canned food with salads made from this same canned food.  Awkward potato ensembles, bland dumplings & sauerkraut. If you want German food head over to Zur Kate, this place is a disaster.

On the Polish front the Kielbasa was perhaps the highlight, perhaps locally made ... perhaps not! Cabbage roll & Pierogies no doubt previously frozen small & bland, sauce was OK nothing special. Still hungry I would have dipped my foot into Scandinavian waters but I suspect it's only ankle deep. I grew up in Wisconsin with these same ethnic foods, if this is what Canadian Food is all about, I'll pass! 

I don't know what's up with this area of the East Valley ... India Oven, Angry Crab Shack, Golden Gate, & now the Beaver Choice. All the worst examples of their ethnic specialties ... yet highly rated on Yelp. 

The only explanation .... It's A Dead Zone."}

Funny name

During my first trip here, I was suffering from a pretty bad cold. Even with a stuffy nose, my taste buds were delighted by their succulent and tasty dishes. We ordered Swedish Meatballs (of course) and the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon Bleu (thank you Yelp). With each dish came three hearty sides garnished by their own tantalizing flavors. I really enjoyed the potatoes with the accompanying sauces and gravy.

I must warn you: you will wait for good food. We probably hung out for about 45 minutes before our order came out. If you're in a hurry, probably go somewhere else. Otherwise, grab one of the card games they have available on the shelf and prepare yourself for some of the best authentic Scandinavian food served in the most random-est of strip malls.

One last thing - these guys know they're good and are proud of it. They posted the award they received from Yelp for having high ratings with lots of reviews. One of the owners explained it was the best award they've won because it comes straight from regular customers. Gotta love that!"}
{"text":"My review is purely based on their service (or lack thereof). The food was really good (had the Poutine and chicken schnitzel) but I don't think it was good enough to return. 

So I got there around 6pm without a reservation. They told me it would be a 30 minute wait so no big deal. Well 30 minutes turned into nearly 90 minutes. I was just about to leave until they called my name. So I sat down with no menus and no silverware on the table. It took almost 30 minutes to get menus and order. Then my food came and it was missing a side so I told the server. The server never brought the side. From the time I finished my meal till the time they picked up the check and processed it, it was nearly an hour. Just terrible service overall!"}
{"text":"Delicious and unique menu,  clean facility,  over the top friendly staff,  fair prices.... 

Excellent.     Will return again and again."}
{"text":"The first time I walked in here I felt like I was being catered to.  The family that runs the restaurant is incredibly friendly.  They offered me a free sample of their wonderful food.

I have eaten the Swedish meatball sandwich, the Swedish meatball pita and the tunbrodsrulle.  Each meal was incredible.  

The restaurant is incredibly clean, the family is very friendly, and the dessert is excellent."}
{"text":"If you can't cook and need a good home cooked meal then head over to Beaver's Choice. The average tab per person for dinner is about $15. The 20-30 minute wait for the food was not a big deal. It gives you a chance to actually talk to your dinning companion(s). 

I had the stuffed cabbage which was just ok for me but not the best I have ever had. The home made coleslaw is a winner and the cubed fried potatoes were delicious. I had some of my wife's Chicken Cordon Blue which comes flattened, not like the Chicken Cordon Blue you might get at a wedding. I have to say it wasn't my favorite. I definitely need to try some other menu items because there were some other dishes at the other tables that looked really good. I also wish they would drop the RC products and switch to coke. In conclusion, I really wasn't blown away by the taste of the food like my fellow Yelpers. This is really a 3 1/2 star restaurant in my opinion, but I'm going to round up to 4 stars since I'm feeling generous today."}
{"text":"DAM, we can't wait to eat at the Beaver again! it's true! it's true!

But before I tell you how great it was a few things need to be mentioned. I was teetering between 4-5 stars on this one because of the European Style Service and I had to forgive them for using canned green beans in the green bean salad. However because of the really over the top seasoning of the prepared foods we tried and the UNIQUENESS of this Quirky one of a Kind place it deserves five stars. You also need to know that this is a Tiny Mom and Pop shop in a strip mall that is BYOB SCANDINAVIAN Bistro that makes your meals fresh to order and when we were the only order it took at least half and hour to prepare. This is not a fancy place and they provide some games like Yahtzee to play with while you wait.

We ordered the Chicken Schnitzel and the Gravlax platter,the platters come with THREE SIDE SALADS EACH and A SIDE DISH!

I had the Gravlax and it was sliced very thin was very fresh and very flavorful I think anyone who eats Lox would like the Gravlox here. For my side salads I picked the house made cole slaw,it was very light and fresh no creamy heavy sauce(it was very good) , tomato basil salad, it was very fresh with lots of fresh basil and yummy balsamic , Peas (just plain) and for my side dish I picked the rosti potato. THAT POTATO was DELICIOUS but was SO LARGE it could feed a small country I could only eat about 1/4 of it.

My husband had the regular chicken schnitzel it was pounded thin , breaded just right and came with a side of mushroom sauce,It tasted very good. One of the sides he picked was the green bean salad and I noticed they are canned green beans, that really is my only slight complaint on any food here.

They don't sell any desserts that are day old here only fresh made and they have the good humor to sell a dessert called Beaver Balls."}
{"text":"Dam, I ate at the Beaver and it was very good! I liked it! I liked it!
You just don't get Gravlax or Scandinavian Food anywhere except for cruise ships and Ikea but here you can get real fresh gravlax thats moist, rich and not too sweet and made just right, tasty with dill and a yummy mustard sauce with it. My super generous plate came with three sides and made with Hanna's own pickled beets that were sauced with rich sour cream. The cole slaw is very fresh, sliced nice and thin and seasoned with fresh dill. The tomato salad is very flavor packed with lots of fresh basil. The food was all flavorful and seasoned very nicely. I remember really liking the rosti from the old Tempe location but was disappointed with the rosti from this new Mesa location as it might have been purchased from Ikea as it had that McDonald's hash brown taste to it but I do note the Mashed potatoes and the dill potatoes looked Excellent and I was sorry I didn't order one of them instead of the rosti.

My husband tried the stuffed chicken breast. It was boneless and very moist. It was prepared very well. One of his side was the green bean salad and it was just like everybody's Mom's green bean salad made with those canned green beans.

The house made desserts do differ from the old Tempe location as the Beaver Balls and other baked desserts are gone and I remember they were very good.

We tried the Swedish Crepe with lingonberries. It was good I liked the not too sweet taste of the lingonberries and reminds me of my lingonberry shrubs from my old house that I planted. The crepe was good but the ice cream was too dense and too sweet for my taste.

You get a warm fuzzy feeling dining here as Hanna, her son and daughter are so friendly. They make you feel very welcomed.

This is one of the best family run businesses that you can go too! When you visit Ikea you should think about stopping here!"}
{"text":"I stopped here because it was featured on the Food Network. Polish AND Scandinavian food. Who would have guessed. I had the sampler plate to try a bit of everything. It comes with your choice of a side AND a choice of three mode side dishes. Amazing. The food was excellent. The staff is friendly, helpful and accommodating. They are a bit slow, so do not come on if you are in a hurry. Very relaxed atmosphere. I will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! I went with my husband on a whim after living right down the street for what seems like forever. We ordered the Quebec poutine, pierogi with bacon and cheddar, schnitzel with pork and hunter sauce and rhubarb chicken. Everything was absolutely delicious! We saw other items that we definitely wanted to try but were too stuffed to order any more. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"My Grandmother was from German side of Austria then moved to Canada.  So growing up I got to eat a lot of her Cooking.  Coming here always reminds me eating her food.  I love having Poutine and Pierogis as well as all the rest of the food here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The food is excellent and the owner is one of the nicest ladies you could meet. Everything we have had here is delicious. The Hunter Schnitzel is one of my favorites and the poutine is the best I've had. They making everything in house and it's always very fresh. You have to try this place!"}
{"text":"Following up on the recent review by another Yelper:

This is not a \"fast food sit-down\" experience.  Food is cooked when you order, by a small but caring staff, and the dishes come out when they are ready.  

Nothing is going to sit for a while under a heat lamp until every dish for that table is ready.

It's more of a \"sit down and stay a while\" experience, especially if there are several groups in the place at the time.

So, adapt accordingly, and you will love the food here and the people who run the place just like all the other 5-star reviewers before you."}
{"text":"Grew up in Sweden and this place brought up a lot of nostalgia. There's a lot of healthy blends of Swedish cuisine with German, Hungarian and Polish. Their elk stew was delicious and my wife had the jager schnitzel, both delicious. The atmosphere is nothing to hang your hat on, but maybe it's supposed to remind people of the Swedish cafeteria style eating, somewhat clean looking space. Still, a few adjustments to the interior could make it look less sterile. 

Overall very solid place. We will be back."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of dining here on Friday night.  There were 4 of us celebrating a birthday, German style.  Hannah was awesome with recommending the right beer (Werewolf..i think) and the perfect dishes.  We ate goulash, bigos, cabbage rolls and elk stew.  Fun variety and delicious food.  We will be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Had lunch & dinner here a couple weeks apart and all I can say it's literally day & night!

Friday lunch - Came in around 11:30 AM and it was not crowded at all.  I got to choose wherever I want to sit.  The menu on their website combined the lunch (grab & go) & dinner (bistro) menu but the actual menus at available at the counter comes in 2 separate menu.  So I order my pita at the counter and within 15 minutes they brought my food out to my table.  But once noon hit, the restaurant started to fill up.

Swedish Pita (4*) - 4 meatballs in a grilled pita, with fresh & juicy cucumbers, tomatoes & lettuce.  It was topped with red onions & a cool tzatziki sauce.  Pretty good deal for $5, just too bad the meatballs weren't super hot.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ad0LjmuXhUGBxTSkve5LZA?select=9QBEoRkLHEenP0tNlzGrNQ

Since my pita didn't came with any side I ordered some heart attack fries Quebec Poutine (4*)  - piping hot beef gravy fried w/ cheese curd
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ad0LjmuXhUGBxTSkve5LZA?select=eYKhaJ2zSuRg1zIUBzoNIQ

I notice the dessert case was quite empty so I asked why because I really wanted a Beaver cookie.  They tell me they were backed up for tonight .  I guess that's what happens when you win Best of New Time's Best Place to Take a Foodie\"

Friday night dinner - all 7 tables of 4 tops were taken, but luckily I had reservations (thanks yelpers). Normally the fast casual method works for me but not when they were getting slammed.   I had to stand behind a long line trying to get something behind the counter.  Food took forever to come out (actually lost our ticket) but luckily the kiddies were happy just dining on Beaver Balls and playing dominoes.  Once the crowd died down, the women owner & her son did a great job tending our needs as if it's a full service restaurant.

You get a grip load of food for the price.  They seem to be be going through some growing pains with all the new publicity.  Still, I can't wait to go back & try out the other Scandinavian dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Scandinavian inspired food with a little Polish (like perogies) and German (like schnitzel) thrown in for good measure. Located on Broadway and McClintock in Tempe, this little store front store restaurant delivers real homemade wraps, sandwiches, burgers, dinner items, etc. 
Parking is plentiful and close to the door, the staff is friendly and the cook looks like someone's Swedish grandma.
I had the Fabian. This is a grilled chicken breast wrap with red onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and a terrific beet salad. Creamy with just the right balance of sweet, tangy, salty and with a nice mix of textures. For only $6.10, I left full and happy.
My daughter had the Chicken Schnitzel. It came with 3 sides plus fries. She got the garden salad, coleslaw and broccoli. There was so much left over she could hardly fit it all in the to-go carton. I think it was around $11.
They open at 11am and were busy by 11:20am. They are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I had been to the previous location in Tempe several times and had been meaning to try the new Mesa location for some time. My friend and I arrived right at 11am since in the prior location they were packed by 11:20am. We were the first to arrive and were surprised that there was only one other table filled by noon when we left. 

This location is much roomier with nicer decor than the previous location. The menu has changed slightly. The prior menu had fun names and has now been replaced with boring descriptions. My friend and I ordered what used to be called the \"Fabian\" but is now called \"a chicken wrap with the beet salad on the inside.\" Hmmmmm . . . just doesn't have the same catchy ring.

The food was good and the service was fine. Parking is close to the door. I sure hope business picks up for them since we have a shortage of Scandinavian/Polish/German/Swiss/French Quebec cuisine in the Valley."}
{"text":"I went there twice, the poutine was tasteless, the schnitzel was Greasy and disgusting. I wouldn't eat there again even if they offered me money. The only good thing there is the service (smiley faces) ,other than that its a waste of money and time"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place? It's got the Ikea inspired interior, it is Scandinavian after all.  The patrons look like they could have been extras in a filming of the Prairie Home Companion.  A wonderful family who is fully invested in making sure you taste the wonders of their cultural heritage.  And a menu filled with some of the tastiest sauces and heartiest dishes that you can find in cuisine that dwells above the 45th parallel."}
{"text":"Somewhat of an obscure place! Really great food! I had the Swedish meatballs and it was really well seasoned. For a mom and pop restaurant, their food is something you'd find in a high end restaurant! For cons, it's a really tiny place, so when it gets crowded, it kinda becomes a pain. Fortunately, the owners have bought a new place but the new place is in process of being refurbished. On another note, I found there was...a lot of potatoes. It's all really good, but you may find yourself ordering a lot of dishes that consists on potatoes! The place is really modest but don't let that deter you! The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! Don't know of another restaurant in Arizona where you can get deliciously prepared  home recipes from Poland, Germany, Scandinavia, Canada. Beaver Choice is a gem. We went here last evening before going to a performance at ASU Gammage. As a participant in Phoenix Restaurant Week, the value is incredible. My wife had the shrimp bisque, seared scallops and strawberry polonaise as her three course meal. My meal consisted of poutine, pork cordon bleu schnitzel, and a chocolate meringue. All dishes were extremely flavorful. It is our intention to return and also spread our recommendation with friends. Go, you will be pleased."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until I saw their sign go up in my neighborhood.  I've never had Scandinavian cuisine before and was anxious to try it.  I got on their website and read some very excellent reviews from prestigious food critics, and having just had my first lunch there, I couldn't agree more.

Their new bistro has Swedish decor and everything is brand new.  Very nice atmosphere for dining.  The owner is adorably charming and she personally greeted us and spent time with all of the customers.  She was very hospitable and makes it a point to explain the origins of anything on the menu you have questions about.

The food was spectacular!  I had the Pork Schnitzel Cordon Bleu and my wife had the Salmon burger with Swedish Shrimp Salad.  Each dish came with a choice of 3 side salads and a side dish.  It sounds like a lot of food but the side portions are small and designed to give a nice variety to your palate.  I can't say enough about the quality of the food.  It tasted very homemade and you could tell that a lot of time goes into the preparation.  They also have a large selection of bottled European beers.

As we were leaving we overheard the owner (Hanna) say, \"I'd rather have 20 happy customers than 100 unhappy customers.\"  I would encourage those who have given a bad review to give them another try in this new location.  Their menu is new and they are adding to it once the dishes are \"perfected\".

By the way, the owner was born in Poland, raised in Sweden, and spent many years in Montreal, Quebec.  The beaver is the national animal of Canada, hence the unusual name \"Beaver Choice\"."}
{"text":"I am a food fanatic, I cook a lot and so we are constantly going out to dinner by default, hoping not to be disappointed in the food and presentation, and getting something better than what I could have done at home and mostly the former occurs rather than the latter, that was until last evening we took a \"FLYER\" and headed to Mesa to try the Beaver Choice.  It was fantastic one of the great dining experience of my young life the scallops were absolutely superb I enjoyed every morsel right down to the last smidgen.  Poutine was another smash, perfect crisp fries, creamy curds and brown gravy right from the farm. Partner had the Chicken Vladimir and said it couldn't have been better, wonderful variety of flavors melded with the chicken breast and potatoes that melted in your mouth.  This dish was recommended by a member of the wait staff, Kayla who was also a gem, and she was right.  We also had the Beaver Supreme, Chocolate meringue, Walnuts and real whipped cream, we had the small but it was enough for the two of us after such a sumptuous meal.  Hana and her husband normally greet the customers as they come thru the door and most get a hug as they leave.  YOU can tell this is a wonderful place, lots of repeat friends and also new, we will be among them."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! You walk in and are instantly greeted by the charming family. I was hesitant at first, but, my husband read good reviews on Yelp! Instantly, we fell in love with the food! EVERYTHING  is sooo flavorful. The schnitzel is AMAZING! This place deserves 6 stars in my book!"}
{"text":"Where to start?  Let's try here: 
- the family who runs the shop are amazingly friendly and helpful.  LOVE THEM
- the food is great and unique - you probably haven't had anything like it, and you need to change that
- I don't know what a beaver has to do with anything, but he's cute so who cares
- Don't let the weird plaza scare you, the place is great, and you should definitely eat in to get the full experience (crazy how good the food is becoming in this weird plaza - Ted's, Papaya, wow!)

I recommend you get over to Beaver Choice now so you can say \"Remember when they were in that little location over on...\""}
{"text":"Why have I not discovered this place sooner!!! All you can eat pierogis?!? Amazing  not only does this place have amazing food the owner is the sweetest person ever the atmosphere was very fun and light! This place is a must try, don't pass up on this lovely spot!"}
{"text":"Got some really yummy food and the best service! It's a nice family restaurant. We got to tour the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Man... it has been quite a while since my last review... This place brought me out from the shadows... 

Eastern Euro lady with a wonderful accent (owner I think) to greet you. 

The beer selection is fantastic, with very hard to find euro beers (think Poland, Croatia, etc.), and a sweet little patio to boot. Let's add in some DELICIOUS elk stew from a Sweedish recipe. Damn. I was shocked at how fantastic this was... Plus, they gave it to me on a bed of perogies! Sure, it was a little spendy ($20), but it would be a great little dinner spot and the quality was well worth the price. 


The service was on point. Very attentive staff. Happy server. Happy customer. I will be back."}
{"text":"Overall 3 and like others have posted, for same reason. Food is authentic. However, there is an older lady who kept asking everyone who entered, if they have a reservation. The majority were walk-in's without reservation. There were 2 waiters - one female and male. The male was working circles around female. The male kept having to go ask questions so it was like he was new and not getting trained. The menu has a disclaimer that prices listed next to items are not solid, the final bill may be more which I thought was strange for non-seasonable food. Then the food came out at all different times so our table couldn't eat together."}
{"text":"Classic food vs service.  Food was great.  Service not.  Had to seat myself then wait five minutes to be approached.   Bartender didn't know how to make a drink and told the server \"No mixed drinks\".  That's a waste of a good liquor license.  Then complained loud enough to be heard when she tried.  Supposedly she was a co owner.   Sad.  Probably family.   That's all for now."}
{"text":"After frequenting the original Tempe location, I had taken a break from Beavers but one day I decided to check out the new location and couldn't be happier. They now also accommodate Gluten Allergies which is a pleasant surprise. I am a big fan of the Howard Special. Which I believe has been switched to Schnitzel cordon blue in the new Menu. 

The food is always top notch, yes it does take some time to get your order but everything is cooked to order. I highly recommend the Schnitzel, cole slaw, any of the potato dishes and the Swedish meatballs."}
{"text":"This place has crazy hours and the staff is rude. Don't come. It is not worth your time, your drive, and your money, unless you like to be treated bad by low class people."}
{"text":"Best authentic made when you order Scandinavian food ever! Forget ikea! Lol. This is fresh -  delicious - great service and super friendly owners and family! I will bring all my friends and family here for years to come without hesitation! 

This place does not cut corners. They make the food only once it has been ordered. This is a truly a great place and I never write reviews since finding amazing places is rare for me. This place makes it worth sharing! Go try it! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"A wonderful dinner spot with family style service. Added a bar since my first visit --or more attention to it?  That was refreshing. Service always interactive and genuine. Speed is not what they brag about so come with a casual mind set and absorb the homemade food. Dessert is a must here ... yum!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and serving sizes were enormous. Everyone was very friendly and the lady at the counter was in the words of my girlfriend adorable. The beaver cookies are awesome it was like eating a lemon meringue pie."}
{"text":"My first experience with Beaver Choice was at the old Tempe Location. The new location is larger. 

Diamond in the rough and well worth the drive!! is still my thought on Beaver choice.

Having had a Swedish Grandmother i have had Swedish delicacies my entire life and was passed down some amazing recipes .

Beaver choice is spot on authentic home-style cooked meals, but, I digress....

The exterior at first blush, may make you have second thoughts about going in ,i do not mean this in a bad way i just mean it is not fancy, nor is the interior- a few framed oil paintings this place screams minimalist. Do not let this fool you into thinking that the food will not impress you ....it will(unless you do not care for dill) 

My son and I have eaten at both locations a few times and  he is now hooked on the Swedish Meatballs (Kottbullar). An order of the meatballs consists of  6 meatballs,  and let me tell you these are fluffy and juicy with a delectable cream sauce and just the perfect amount of seasoning. You get a choice of 3 sides with your meal ,and he always gets  the dill mashed potatoes, broccoli, and marinated beans ( like a 3 bean salad) 
This is not a small plate  of food,  this is like hungry man giant sized food !!!!

I love The Schnitzel ( TO DIE FOR ) laden with Porcini mushroom sauce. For sides  i love the thyme potatoes, sauerkraut (amazing) and pickled beets ( so good) .again this is so much food you will have most of it wrapped up so you can bring it home.

Do not expect artisan looking food or fancy presentation, this is home-style cooking, and no light hand is used with flavoring,  and especially with the dill.

This place is totally laid back ...i mean way laid back ,you feel like your at a relatives house sitting in the kitchen after a long journey and they have made a feast for you .

Also expect to wait for your food a bit ...this is a small family operation with a good crowd of fans coming in to chow down ..
Mom and pop operation with off the hook Swedish and Polish fare .

PRICE ; Totally reasonable at less than 15 bucks per plate, but as i said we are talking hella food!! ,well prepared authentic home-style cooking. 

worth every penny !

Take-out : yes they have take out ( which is awesome, since now i have someone who wants these meatballs frequently )

Oh,  And the cookies rock too !!! yes the beaver balls are mad good .
I have the number in my phone ...well worth the drive even for take out.

Owners are top notch!

{"text":"Outstanding food and options unlike any other restaurants in the area.  The stuffed schnitzel was amazing and so was the Potato pancake. The fresh salads with your. Walk are nothing short of amazing.  Love the atmosphere and choices on the menu  some of. The desserts are exceptional and can only be found here and in Europe. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Spoiler alert:  there's no beaver on the menu.  

If you can get past that crushing disappointment, Beaver Choice will provide you with a culinary journey through Europe - particularly Scandinavia, Germany, and Poland.  I'd definitely call it a \"homestyle\" restaurant, but that's not a knock - it's like sitting in a grandma's kitchen 3,000 miles away, eating timeless comforting foods.

At the start of the meal, they gave us each a free pierogi, which solidified our decision to order our own appetizer plate.  We tried potato and cheese, potato and bacon, and potato and cheese and jalapeno.  I was right in guessing that the last one would be like a pierogi jalapeno popper.  We had them with caramelized onions and sour cream.  Sooooooo goooood.  I've had plenty of pierogies - store bought, homemade, and restaurant-made, and these were among the best.  

My entree was the laxpudding, so we swiveled from Poland to Sweden. This is like if an omelet and a lox bagel had a delicious, perfect baby together!  Seriously, google the recipe.  This was delicious (and even better somehow when I reheated it for breakfast the next day, which is just magic) and exactly what I was craving.  It doesn't look appetizing, but it's wonderful.  It was paired with a couple of salads, including beets, which balanced it with some acidity.  

The service was very friendly, but seemed to be a bit disorganized - two servers were fairly equally handling our table and they'd overlap in the most unfortunate ways.  For example, one took our drink order and then both brought our drinks (including two of a delicious Swedish cider, but I only kept one), but then we asked both for napkins and neither brought them.  They definitely needed to coordinate/communicate or just assign sections.  

We paid in cash, but I noticed a sign on the door that said they charged more if you used a credit card.  So make sure you take note of what that says... or pay in cash."}
{"text":"This place is becoming one of my favorites.  Food portions are HUGE. When asked to describe it I have difficulty but usually can just say it reminds me of growing up with my Buscia's (that's Polish for grandmother) cooking.  So yes, comfort food would be pretty spot on.  The owners are SO FRIENDLY...they always come around to your table to talk to you and see how you are doing.  

When people ask me about it I just say \"go there, I promise you will not be disappointed!\"

I also really like their new spot, a ways farther than the last one...but still worth it and they have a fantastic beer selection.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great discovery . I have been looking for East European restaurant 
and I found this one.
Original food as I remember my grandma's cooking.
Definitely I'll come back.."}
{"text":"Holy delicious meatballs batman!!! This place is so damn good! After visiting Canada 5 years ago, I fell in love with poutine, nowhere in AZ was I able to find it... until now... GO HERE, EAT, BE HAPPY! Support local restaurants!"}
{"text":"Worth the drive to Tempe! NOT fancy but totally comfortable thanks to the wonderful, gracious family owners/operators.

Do NOT miss the dill mashed potatoes! Also, I LOVED the tomato sauce that came with the cabbage rolls. Was dipping everything I possibly could in it!! 

I ordered both of the beet options but, if forced to choose, liked the beet salad best... wound up \"cleaning\" the dish by wiping it down with the remaining pickled beets! 

I liked the cabbage rolls but I LOVED the hash one of my dining companions had ordered. This is likely what I will get on my next visit.

The pierogi were boiled but didn't seem to spend any time in a frying pan. I love pierogi but I prefer them to have a little more of a crunch -- the firmness you get from a quick pan fry.

It's a tiny, casual place. Order at the counter, they bring you your food and you pay at the counter when you're done.

A BYO, if you also bring your own glasses they waive the corking fee!

Seriously cannot wait to go back!! :9"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is great, service is great, owner is great. It's all great. I went there with a large group. I called ahead and they saved us a table. Our server was amazing. We were all rather tipsy by the end of the meal and gladly accommodated our really bizarre check-splitting request. 

The food was awesome. The pierogies are sinfully good. The Swedish meatballs are amazing. And there's this wonderful beet salad that I could eat every day. We also had the Beaver Supreme for dessert which is just about the most unique thing I've ever eaten. 

We were in there forever and everyone was super nice to us. The owner came out at my friend's request so that we could tell her how awesome our server was. The owner asked us to review her new menu and gave us the recipe for her amazing meatballs!

It was so much fun and I'm sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"Miserable. 

Our attempts at ordering were thwarted by a server with no knowledge of the menu. In his defense he was a hipster who had *only* been working there two months and apparently doesn't care about *anything* especially being able to do his job. 

Our attempts at ordering were further thwarted by a chef/cook who was either unwilling or unable to create the first four items we tried to order. The fifth item ordered was the $22 polish sampler - which had 1 Go?baki, 3 Pierogies and 1 Polish Sausage. We were informed the Pierogies would all be of the same type (flavor/filling) and would be the cook's choice, additionally the type of sausage was unknown. Not very reassuring if your polish place can't tell you the difference between kielbasa and kabanos.

We finally settled on a pierogi appetizer, an order of go?baki, and the Jäger Schnitzel. Regarding the pierogi - the menu says \"We have different types of flavors everyday so please ask our friendly staff!\" - we tried but were unable to find the friendly staff, so we asked our server (who didn't have a clue).

The pierogi selections were all potato filled, including the cheese one. 
The pierogi aren't any better than the frozen Mrs. T brand at every grocer.
The go?baki was an unspecified ground meat wrapped in cabbage with plain tomato paste covering it. The Jäger Schnitzel might have been good, had it *any* seasoning - even just a little salt.

In summary, if you're seeking a good authentic Polish food restaurant - keep looking, this ain't it."}
{"text":"Loved the food!!! The owner was very attentive and visited with us. Staff was great and friendly. Super clean and attractive. Tried four dishes, one appetizer, two desserts. Will definitely be back for more. 
I had the CHICKEN VLADIMIR. The chicken was moist, the sauce tangy with some spice. The salad was fresh and roasted potatoes, couldn't get enough."}
{"text":"I tried to go to Beaver Choice on a Saturday night a couple of months ago, but when we arrived we were informed that they were booked solid for the night so we went elsewhere.  I think it was right after they got some love from the New Times.

Yesterday, my wife and I tried again, forgetting that a reservation might be a good idea, but now, even though we are out of the height of the summer heat, no reservation was necessary.  The place was only about 40% full.

The owner was sitting in the booth closest to the door and sprung up to seat us.  Upon grabbing a booth, 2 glasses and a full pitcher of water was brought along with a couple of perogies with sour cream.  The perogies where hot, crispy, and nicely spiced and the cooling sour cream improved it further. 

The room is kinda odd ... dominated by a huge LED illuminated bar in a place I don't imagine many people go to drink.  And there's a stray display case at the far end against the wall not serving any discernible purpose.

I tried to order a diet soda, but they carry RC Cola and Diet Rite is the most awful drink on the planet so i stuck with the agua.

I started looking through the menu when I saw something (actually 2 things) I don't think I've ever seen on a menu before.  First, they offer a \"Salmon Lasagna\".  Salmon with tomatoes covered in mozzarella cheese.  It might actually be great, but it is the most horrible sounding dish I've seen on a menu in a while. 

Secondly, almost the entire last page is taken up with \"Menu Disclaimers\"; the most interesting of which states that the prices and items listed on the menu might not be accurate and are not guaranteed.  Huh?  You're going to decide what to charge me after I order?  You reserve the right to substitute pork for my chicken in the schnitzel? What if I have a dietary restriction you don't know about?

I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon Blue and my wife got the Swedish sampler with gravlax, a mini shoemakers box, and Swedish meatballs.

While we were waiting for our food, the waiter brought us a flyer showing their menu for next week's Restaurant Week promotion.  At $33 pp, the Restaurant Week deal represents only about $3 off the regular menu price, assuming you'd be ordering a full app, entree, and dessert anyway. Oddly, a few minutes later, he collected the flyer back from us.  I'm kinda glad I didn't spill anything on it not knowing if they'd try to charge me for it.

The food came and was absolutely excellent.  The schnitzel was thin, moist, and crispy with just the right amount of breading and cheese inside.  My wife's dinner was also excellent.  And when the check came, the prices actually did match the menu.

After reading the other reviews here on Yelp,and judging by how empty the place now is, it would appear that the atmosphere created by the owner is finally taking its toll.  As I left, the one word that came to mind was \"chintzy\".  The entire vibe is one of the owner watching everyone like a hawk lest they \"get away with something\" like sharing a meal without volunteering the $5 split fee.

It's a shame.  The food is very well executed and is good enough to keep this place packed on a Saturday night.  I'll go back, but I can guarantee I will never order anything combining salmon and mozzarella."}
{"text":"Who would ever guess that Beaver Choice was a Scandinavian restaurant? And across the parking lot from Ted's Hot Dogs? The convoluted naming history apparently originated from the Mascot of a University they originally were sited near in Canada. But beavers and hot dogs and Massage in the same center?

The food is unusually wonderful and  . . . unusual. The family cooks and servers are over the top friendly offering samples and telling you about all of their offerings. 

The atmosphere is uncomfortably stark, sterile, and small (less than 400 ft2). Their obvious target customer is take-it-out since they offer a 10% discount if you take-it-out. It is not a restaurant you go to to relax, sit back, and enjoy. It is so small we watched as the cook dipped his ladle into the pot, then tasted the contents, tapped the ladle on the side of the pot, added something else, tasted, tapped, and added several more times before going to another pot and repeating the process - yikes! Do yourself a favor, take the seat facing the window."}
{"text":"We went to the old location about 18 months ago, and after visiting their new home, it was a breath of fresh air to be greeted by Chef Hanna  upon arrival.  She is the sweetest and most passionate lady - and it's always an honor to have her prepare food for you.  We brought our appetite, and started with the small order of poutine - which is Canadian comfort food at it's best, eh?  Crispy fries with fresh cheese curds and delicious gravy peppered with parsley - it's just yum.  Then, for the main course, I had the cordon bleu and Angie ordered the schnitzel.  The side items are artfully prepared, I had couscous / potato and dill salad / beet salad for mine and they were spot on.  You can tell that everything is fresh, and no expense is spared in putting her passion on a plate.  It probably wasn't, but the food tasted better this time around, and I'm already excited to go back for the two items she promised: spaetzle and her Beaver Supreme dessert!"}
{"text":"Beaver Choice has delicious food, but service seems to be a challenge for them to master.  I've eaten here many times, and the food is often tasty.  I've witnessed poor and slow service at other tables, but this was my first experience with it. 
Last week I had lunch with a friend and was shocked by the poor service and mediocre food.  I had to apologize to my friend a few times because they weren't performing.  The owner and her son were waiting tables, or more precisely, they were waiting some tables.  Our table wasn't on the list.  
We ordered the salmon burger with shrimp salad, which I wouldn't recommend.  We had to ask for forks and napkins; none were on the table and the wait staff didn't notice it.  Seems that should be automatic in a restaurant -  to see that patrons aren't eating their food.  We weren't sitting in the back corner either; we were up front at the 2nd table.  Once we got our forks no one stopped by our table to ask about our food, but they were readily chatting it up with the table right next to ours.  
After waiting way too long, the owner finally offered the dessert menu, but didn't ask about my friend's half eaten burger.  The place was not busy at all, and now I understand why.  Will be a long time before I return here."}
{"text":"Loved everything. Great Polish, Swedish, Austrian and various other dishes. Great Poutine, as well. Eccentric, hard-working owner, friendly staff and well-worth a drive to the East Valley."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Hannah is a complete bitch. I've worked in the food industry for YEARS and I know to NEVER treat a customer let alone another person the way that she treated me and everyone else in that place. She's rude to her staff and customers. And the family doesn't care how they look to the customers because they all back each other up and make sure you feel real stupid. The food comes out cold and for the price and time you wait it's NOT worth it. They need Chef Ramsey to go in and show them how to make real food. This place is pathetic and a disgrace to Scandinavia food I'm surprised it's still up and running. I think the guy that helped after the bitchy owner was Chris and he mentioned he was the son and he's just a dick and doesn't care. The blond girl was our server and the poor girl just puts up with it. I don't care how much money you make in a night, it is not worth putting up with such horrible bosses. The food, the waiting, the overpriced menu and the service sucks. Do yourself a favor a save the money for a restaurant that knows what they're doing. Hannah you're a pathetic rude bitch. Learn respect"}
{"text":"Beaver Choice.  Let's just get this out of the way.  I don't know what the name means, I have no idea why it's named that, I don't know why the logo is a beaver (the animal kind - get your heads out of the gutter people) in a Swedish triple crown shirt holding a fork.  With all that said, what I do know is this place is definitely worth a try.  

I had never heard of the place until my girlfriend fiancée sent me a link saying we should check it out sometime.  I checked out the menu online, it looked good, so rather than wait several weeks for my fiancée to have a free lunch period, I decided to investigate for myself that very same day.  Good move on my part.  

It's a great little Scandinavian restaurant that's only been open for a couple of weeks in a pretty non-descript suite in the strip mall behind Ted's Hot Dogs at McClintock & Broadway.  It's a very clean place with about 6 or 7 four tops, furnished from top to bottom by...you guessed it...Ikea.  It's a family owned and operated spot and they are some of the sweetest people you will ever meet.  They are very proud of their little piece of Scandinavia in the desert and it shows in their service and their food.  

They are well aware of the fact that with the exception of Swedish meatballs, most people aren't really familiar with Scandinavian food so when you approach the counter, right off the bat they ask if you would like to try a little sample platter free of charge.  Who's going to turn that down?  I had a little piece of Gravlax (raw salmon cured in salt, sugar and dill), some potato salad and some pink lunch salad thing the name of which I forget.  I really enjoyed the Gravlax and potato salad but the pink one was made with sour cream and since I've never been a fan of sour cream I only had a bite of that one.  

They have two menus. One could best be described as a lunch/to-go menu and one that they call the bistro menu which is essentially akin to a dinner menu except that you can get anything on it all day.  They have salads, wraps, sandwiches, soups, entrees, etc. with all kinds of different varieties of meats to choose from.  They even had two that they say on the menu are recommended for hangovers.  My kind of place! It all ranges in price from about $5 for sandwiches and wraps up to about $15 for a couple of the full sized dinner entrees though most of the dinner entrees mostly hover around $10 which is a steal for the amount of food that you get.  

I decided to try the schnitzel.  It comes with a decent little side salad with your choice of either a honey mustard or garlic vinaigrette, a little citrusy red cabbage slaw both of which were good but were primarily there to compliment the main event which was the schnitzel.  It's an enormous breaded pork cutlet stuffed with ham and brie cheese, cooked to perfection and topped with an amazing mushroom gravy and on the side were dill mashed potatoes also topped with the gravy.  Both of them were in a word, delicious.  It was about $11 for the whole entrée and it was worth every penny.  I wasn't able to finish the whole thing but I can tell you that it keeps really well because I had it for breakfast this morning.  

I haven't tried anything else on the menu but if any of it is even half as a great as the schnitzel, it's gotta be pretty damn good.  

You know how every now and then you go to a place that's just starting out and you get great service and great food and you just hope that they make it?  Well this is one of those places.  I strongly suggest that you go check it out."}
{"text":"To set the record straight for all the pervs out there who thought I was checking in at a strip club tonight (it's Wednesday night for God's sake and I have to work in the morning!!!!), Beaver Choice is a tiny, VERY unassuming Scandinavian/ Canadian restaurant in a strip mall in Tempe.

Check out all of the awesome reviews to get an idea of how great this place is and then get in here. They serve a nice selection of Scandinavian fish, meat and pork dishes.

I started out with Quebec-style poutine which was delicious (the Canadians weren't pulling my leg on this). The only thing that was missing was beer (they are BYO FYI, so I'll bring beer next time). I'm telling you folks, our evil socialist neighbors to the north know how to whip out some great comfort food!!!!!

For my main I enjoyed some hearty Swedish meatballs bathed in a hearty cream sauce and accompanied with tomato basil, spinach salad and sauteed green beans. You get a LOT of food because your main comes with a side(choice of potato) and three types of salad. The salads are small but throw in three choices, your side and your main and you wind up with a lot of food.

They have a nice selection of tasty looking pastries as well but you will be so full you'll want to get your dessert to go.

The family that run the place are so warm, hospitable, kind and welcoming and I'm thrilled that they're moving to a bigger location. This is a hidden gem in the valley and really and great option when you're sick of all the usual choices to eat."}
{"text":"I was expecting the food to be good, but not hold-back-your-tears-in-front-of-your-friend-because-this-is-actual-magic good. I had the Schnitzel Cordon Bleu (chicken option) Sandwich and a small Quebec Poutine. The poutine is amazing - and the real deal. The Schnitzel Cordon Bleu Sandwich was crispy and moist, and dripped beautiful cheese as I bit into its heavenly goodness. It was a mess. I was a mess. Worth every bite.

The service was awesome. The atmosphere is comfortable and clean. They're going to have a food truck coming out soon too, I was told. My stomach is ready."}
{"text":"Seriously, seriously great ethnic dishes. Great beer and wine selection. Menu is varied with entrees flagged as to the country of origin.
Pierogi choices abound- potato, farmer cheese, meat you select if you want them deep fried, steamed, or pan fried. You also choose the type of gravy/sauce for them.  Six varieties each of schnitzel, salmon, pork loin.  Generous portions each entree served with 3 sides of you choice.  I had the Shoebox dinner which is roasted pork loin served with dill mashed potatoes, a bacon mushroom brown gravy which is so god you want to lick your plate, and a side plate of my chosen sides.  All this for $16.00!
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My mother, aunt, sister, and I came here for lunch Friday. The four of us say \"4 Thumbs Down\"! Absolutely the worst meal we have had dining out in a long time. My mother, sister, and I chose the Smörgåsbord because we were disappointed about the new lunch menu they currently are serving. Eeeeeew.... the hot food was NOT hot (except cabbage rolls). The food  was barely lukewarm. The gravy in the gravy boats were cold. The salads were sat on a table and were not chilled with ice. My mother asked if they could warm her food up because the food was cold( Mind you the food was untouched on a clean plate. she was still at the serving bar). They told her no. So we all ate cold sausages, meatballs, and schnitzel. This is the best part.....are you ready....you pay for the Smörgåsbord by the pound, $9.50 a pound. This is a restaurant for goodness sake! Shouldn't it be a flat rate for all you can eat? This isn't Fry's olive bar or Albertson's salad bar where you expect to be charged by the pound. We were told that the pierogies on the Smörgåsbord were a variety of flavors. There was only one flavor up there, potato. And they too were cold. Also, on the lunch menu you can no longer chose your salads and side with your meal. They chose them for you. Once again, I was not offered a refill on my iced tea. It was empty before I finished my plate. For $2.75 a refill should be offered. I'm a flight attendant for a major airline for well over 25 years. I have traveled the world extensively during my career. There is nothing special about this place. The food is less than desirable. The staff needs to be more sensitive and responding to the customer when expressing discontent. And please remove that scary looking halloween type waiter at the front door. It's creepy!"}
{"text":"Great family atmosphere with super friendly staff. Everyone was enjoying themselves. BYOB! always a plus. Plenty to eat. You will be stuffed! Desserts as well. Reservations recommended. Just a great local place with great international food."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars.  Here's the thing.  The food probably deserved four stars.  Tried a lot of new things, they were great. 

However. The service was hands down the worst I have ever had at any restaurant. Impressively bad. Ridiculously long wait times before being seated, before ordering, before getting our food. Every person in my group had some part of their order messed up. One of my party was given a red wine instead of the white they ordered and the server actually pushed back when she asked for the wine she had actually ordered. 

Unfortunately I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Good eats. I got the Polish sampler with couscous and green salad. The pierogi were nicely crisp and perfectly seasoned, the cabbage roll delicious, and the sausage thick and chewy. Plenty of couscous for leftovers and the salad was crisp and lightly dressed. The takeout service was decently quick and there's plenty of parking. Definitely a winner."}
{"text":"I'm polish and this food is amazing and the owner is the sweetest! Come on in for all you can eat pierogis every Thursday!!!"}
{"text":"More people need to know about this place!

We were seated quickly and were immediately brought water. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The atmosphere is casual, but still nice for a date night. 

I ordered the Jager chicken schnitzel, which is thin fried chicken breasts with a brown wine gravy mushroom sauce. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the gravy was outstanding. Each meal comes with a side dish and 3 side \"salads\". For the side I got the dill mashed potato, which were alright. My sides were green beans, beet salad and tomato basil. All very delicious. I am all about variety and flavor matching, so I love that I was able to customize my meal so much. 

Boyfriend got the Polish sampler plate with the two types of meatballs, and potato dumplings. He thoroughly enjoyed his meal, and as did I of the bites I stole. Although this place serves food that traditionally is not spicy, they even had sriracha available.

I was regretfully too full to venture into the desert menu, however I will DEFINITELY be back to try what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!

First time having authentic polish, Canadian and Scandinavian food! 

Everything was delicious. You have to get the schnitzel! It's just a must. The Poutine is great too. I honestly don't have one bad thing to say about this place. 

P.S. Food can take a little time but it's worth the wait and it's made to order so really how can you complain?!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I had the Swai and it was cooked perfectly along with cured salmon as appetizers.

Highly recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Getting started with lunch buffet. Fill your plate and pay by weight. Salad and dressing were gluten free. Sausage \"from Chicago\" did not seem to have fillers. Good place to get your Scandinavian food fix with a Polish twist.  Self serve, Very casual at lunch time."}
{"text":"Silly name, friendly staff, small interior, generous portion, fresh flavorful ingredients, good value for the money. I had the Gordon's Wrap off the to-go menu - seasoned chicken (thigh?), lettuce, tomato, cucumber, potato salad wrapped in a tortilla. It came out within a few minutes. Only downside was that it was a bit messy and falling apart with all that goodness contained by a thin tortilla, but quite tasty! I couldn't imagine staying for a sit-down meal because as others have mentioned it feels more like a carry-out place, but I may have to try it next time. Oh, and they have signs up saying they are addressing concerns about the wait times for orders which I think shows they care. Good for them -hope it works."}
{"text":"4 of us went for Arizona Restaurant Week. All tried different apps, everything was great except the shrimp bisque.  It came cold. They took it back & returned it microwaved in the same bowl. The entrees were all delicious & deserts were lovely. So everything on the special menu was great! Except the bisque. The wait staff seemed very overwelmed at first but got their timing quickly.  They were all very nice. Definitely worth the drive from central Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is like a warm hug for my soul. The fam and I were looking for something different. Specifically something European. We were so thrilled to find this place! 

This is a small, family run restaurant. It feels like walking into babcia's (grandma's) kitchen on a special holiday. 

In our family of 4 we ordered:
Appetizer- Poutine with bacon (heavenly)
Schnitzel Cordon Bleu with Polish potato dumplings..... AMAZING
Polish Grandpa Plate- so much food. So much flavor. So much happiness in the tummy.
Viking Schnitzel- wowza! So good!
Mini burgers (kids menu)- surprisingly good! Not typical \"kid menu bland\"

We loved the complementary pierogis brought to the table. I saw the previous Yelpers say the owner is rude. I definitely did not experience this. She was kind, warm, and very inviting. 

So, with all this glowing praise, why not 5 stars? Well, the decor (specifically the booths) are so uncomfortable and if they were pulled out and standard table and chairs put in it would up the restaurant so much. Second, it took way too long for the bar drinks to come out. Hubs ordered a beer and it was at least 15 mins before it came to the table. The waitress did tell us the bartender \"disappeared\" but...how hard is it to get a bottle of beer? 


We have found ourselves telling several people about this restaurant since we went. It really is a must try! We will be back."}
{"text":"Great service, extremely nice owners, and most of all home made Swedish Meatballs.  

I am so glad I found The Beaver Choice."}
{"text":"To start, the owner (I am assuming) is sooo amazing and friendly.  She was very passionate about what she is doing, serving her food, doing it well.  We were greeted by her when my Sis and I went to pick up our take out order.  When we got home I went right for the poutine, ohh my yummy.  My Mom had the pork schnitzel, it was very good, the side salads were so good, the green bean and the tomato basil were very good. The herb roasted potatoes were sooooooooo good! My Sis had an amazing meatball wrap with potato salad in it, it was also very very very good.  My sausage wrap with dill potatoes was good, just odd.  Each part was very good, but all put together didn't mesh well for me.  I was diggin the dill mashed potatoes out because they were very good.  

For being run by warm and welcoming people and for making poutine that great, and for the schnitzel, potatoes and meatball wrap... Five stars!"}
{"text":"I happened by this place the second day they were open when going to Teds hot dogs. The mother and son working there were awesome and friendly. The food was great and reasonably priced. We probably went there once a month for lunch, then they moved. 

They are now right down the street from my house. Once they reopened my lunch bunch headed over. The prices had gone up significantly and the waitress was terrible. They charged my friend like $1.75 for what amounted to 2 spoonfuls of extra gravy for his dry meatball sandwich. We now don't get to go there for lunch because of that. 

I took my wife there the other night.  The wait staff was friendly but very unattentive. They easily could have sold us an extra beer and glass of wine but never came back until they cleared our plates.  I ordered the Hunter Schnitzel and my wife ordered the shoe maker's box, both $16.95 on the menu but when the bill came they charged us $17.95.  The Schnitzel was passable but no way worth $17.  Both dishes were smothered in beef gravy that was obviously from a jar (I don't see any beef on the menu that would render a homemade gravy,should have been a red flag). It completely ruined the dish. I also expected a fresher sauerkraut, it also could have been from a jar. The cornish pasty and the All Pierogi restaurant down the street both make a really good fresh sauerkraut, I expected it to be at least as good as theirs. Lastly the mashed potatoes were cold. I would have sent mine back but I could never get the waiters attention. In fact, when he took my debit card he never came back with it. I had to chase him around the restaurant to get it back."}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner at Beaver Choice tonight. Our server was lovely, efficient and welcoming. The restaurant was clean and comfortable. We had Jagerschnitzel and Viking Schnitzel. The flavors were wonderful. The breading had a subtle spice that added to the flavor of the mushrooms. We also had the Garlic, Leek Smashed Potatoes. That combination was a great addition to the pork of the Jagerschnitzel. The beet salad with horseradish is a must try. We finished with the Lemon Fluff which was a refreshing finish. We thanked the owner and his son on our way out. We will be back the next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Went to Beaver Choice with the International Supper Club UYE on a wed evening, this was the place that was picked. I was very excited to try them out, heard a lot of good things from friends so I wanted to find out for myself.

I was given the heads up to make sure to call our reservations in early, that they need time to set up and prepare for parties, so I calld a week in advanced and let them know that I needed a reservation for a party of 15 for Wed at 6:30pm, they seemed a little hesitant so I wasn't sure how the night was going to go when we got there.

We showed up Wed and everything was set up perfectly, Chris, the owners son, showed us where our table was, and was very helpful throughout the entire evening. 

Since I'm watching my calories (who does that when dinning on great food!!!) and my budget (why wasn't I just born a billionaire???)  I asked my best friend if she was up to splitting a dish with me, and she said yes! Perfect!  So we decided on the Schnitzel Cordon Bleu- it was a flatted out chicken breast with smoked ham, imported French crème brie cheese (heaven!!!!) and this delish mushroom gravy, we also had to pick out 3 side salads, and we went with tomato basil, green salad and my best friend was dead set on having the beet salad, she doesn't put her foot down often but that night it was beet salad, and I was thinking OMG that stuff is all yours, who eats beets! haha and with it was pan fried thyme potatoes.

Our food came out, and they even gave us an extra plate, the dish looked amazing, when I got to taste the chicken cordon bleu, I was upset that I didn't just order the dish for myself, so tasty!  But I have to say even though I was not feeling the beet salad, that stuff was amazing, I can't even describe it, it was light, creamy, tad bit sweet. Who would have known!

Though we were there for a while, I wouldn't really say service was slow. Chris told us that they have only been in the new place for 3 weeks and at their old place in Tempe it was just him and his parents who waited tables & cooked; now they have a staff and they are all learning everything together. So I'm excited to come back in a few months to see how they are doing!

Great choice for the International Supper Club UYE to have picked! Enjoyed everything and hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Ok, I think I am going to be booed for this.  Yes, 2 stars!  I have heard so much great things about their food at the Tempe location.  Bummed when I finally had time they closed and was moving to the Mesa location.  So when L said they are open NOW, lets go I was drooling...  =)  

The Mesa location is new, nice, and clean.  It was pretty roomy too.  Got there at 6:20pm, we had a reservation for 6 to 7 people at 6:30pm.  They tired to give us a table for 4, so we had to stress that we have 6 to 7 people.  They sat us in a corner table but it was only for 5.  We had to ask for 2 more chairs twice.  Service was very slow (snail speed).  Our other 3 people finally joined us around 6:40 and then 6:45pm.  We ordered drinks and app.  We got the poutine (french fries covered in cheese curds and gravy) not on the menu.  The drinks and the app came out quick.  Yum!  We munched and then she came back to take our order around 7:05pm.  She told us that the kitchen was backed up and was going to put our ticket in in 5 mins so all the dishes would come out together and hot.  

Ok.  fast foward to 7:50pm.  The app was licked clean, drinks are empty, and we are straving.  After watching a few tables that came after us eat and left, we were feeling like did they lose our ticket?  We flagged the another server down to check because we have not see our server for the last 20 mins or more.  She told us our ticket is 4th  in line, but she couldn't tell us how much longer.  How did our ticket get push that far back?  Especially watch people that came after us get food.

The owner, she was making her rounds with the tables.  She came to ours and thought we were finished.  Oh NO, we have not received our food yet.  We told her we have been waiting for almost 1 hour.  I have proof, I have been bored and I was taking pictures and the time is stamped on them.  The owner came back from the kitchen with the POS receipt and said we didn't put in our order until 7:28pm.  OH NO, we gave our order to the server a little after 7pm, if she choose to sit on it for over 20 mins that is not my problem.  YOU JOKING?  The serve came back and told us I told you I was going to put your order in after 10 mins.  Oh no, you said 5 min.  Either way, ordered at 7:05 + 10 mins = 7:15pm not 7:28pm.  They blamed that it was that we were waiting for people.  So how in the heck did you get their orders if they were not here yet?  WHAT?  OK, now I am hungry and pissed.  It is 8;05pm now.  My butt can tell me how long I have been sitting.  

At 8:19pm the food FINALLY got here.  And guess what?  Some of the orders were wrong; most of the food was on a cold plate with luke warm food; and then a food runner showed up with an extra plate of food.  OMG, what a cluster fxck!  We were scope sides of other's plates and trading food until we assembled something close to what we ordered.  

We were finished eating and then the wait for the bills.  We all had our wallets out and were ready.  She dropped off the bills and we asked her for a box togo.  Nothing.  Then she came back to pick up the money & bills.  Took another 10 mins before the change is coming back.  Then the wait for the togo box starts.  We finally left at 9:05pm.  I am grouchy and my butt hurts from sitting so long (extra grouchy now).  I hate to give family establishments a bad review but my first expirence was just horrible!!!!  Maybe it was just a 1-off incident?"}
{"text":"I'm always game for a culinary adventure and trying a new restaurant. Today, I ventured to Beaver Choice for a friend's birthday and received a full orientation to the Scandinavian, Polish, and Canadian dishes on the menu. My friend has been a loyal customer of this family-run restaurant for sometime now and she received a warm greeting from the owner, Hanna, when she arrived. Hanna was busy in the kitchen making a fresh batch of pierogi and you can tell she pours her heart into the food and greeting her guests. 

For the first time visitors in our party, the birthday girl recommended \"anything with the word schnitzel or the meatballs\" and the beat salad, homemade coleslaw, and marinated green bean salad. I ordered the the Chicken Schnitzel with the porcini mushroom sauce, which came with 3 side salads and a side for $14.95 on the dinner menu. The chicken was moist but the schnitzel didn't have much flavor on its own and I didn't much care for the porcini mushroom gravy. I love porcini mushrooms and others seemed to like the gravy, but it just didn't do it for me. Maybe I would have been better off with the JÄGAR SCHNITZEL and the roast beef gravy? For my side, I ordered the Rösti (fried potato pancake) which was a little overly fried for my liking. The three side salads, however, were DELICIOUS! The homemade coleslaw was dressed in a light vinaigrette which was refreshing and delicious. The potato salad had a nice dill flavor and the marinated green bean salad tasted fresh (not out of a can). 

The food at Beaver Choice was good, but admittedly I'm not a HUGE fan of this type of cuisine and it was just a little bit heavier of a meal and more fried food than I'm used to. The restaurant does offer a friendly atmosphere and the salmon burger that my neighbor ordered looked quite appetizing so I may just have to return to try the other offerings!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They service is good and the food is amazing. And there is so much food. Tonight my foosie group tried the poutine and crab cakes for appetizers. I had the Viking pork schnitzel, friends had hunter Schnitzel, Swedish meatballs and chicken cordon Bleu.  So we had a pretty good variety of things to try. Everything was great. Last time we tried  pierogies and the cheesecake version, which are delicious. The owner reminds me of my Polish grandma. So sweet. If you haven't eaten here, you are missing out."}
{"text":"A lovely balance of authentic foods from my favorite lands. And the nicest hosts I've run into at a restaurant for years now. I'll surely visit again next time in Phoenix. -pat"}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would. Excellent poutine. Wonderful schnitzel. Amazing pierogis. You cannot go wrong here. Save room for the crepes! 
Wonderful owner and staff. Clean, welcoming and attentive. Amazing unique bar selection, don't be afraid to try something.
Prices may be higher than most chain places people frequent but that is because they use fresh and homemade ingredients. A lot of their items are locally sourced. You get what you pay for and won't leave hungry. If you have ever watched Gordon Ramsey rant about how to cook the right way with fresh amazing ingredients this place is the perfect example of how to do it right."}
{"text":"Last night the good and the STAFF were both awesome.  Would give this place ten stars if possible.   You definitely should give this place your appetite,  you will be thrilled you did!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Beavers Choice several times.  Every dish we have tried is perfectly cooked and the flavor is out of this world.  

The restaurant is kept clean.  The servers are attentive, but not over bearing.  

This is a must try restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and filling. If you are in the mood for comfort food...look no further. Don't pass this up. Great find!
Service is Fast and very friendly. 
Ambiance  Clean and orderly. Tables from IKEA are cute. However, the decor does lack...something. The lady behind the counter says they are moving to a location in Mesa by February. 
Would I recommend this place to our friends??? Absolutely!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. The food is so authentic I feel like I am back in Europe! Also the owner is so knowledgeable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it.  I had a craving for Swedish meatballs and found this place by browsing Yelp.  We drove all the way from North Scottsdale to try it.  Totally worth it.  I tried the meatballs with coleslaw, dill mashed potatoes, and basil tomatoes.  My husband got a steamed fish dish with fries, peas, and a spinach salad.  Everything was REALLY good and homemade.  The coleslaw was not like the regular coleslaw you would expect, but it was fantastic.  All real, fresh ingredients too... no fake potato spud mix, no frozen/canned peas.

The people there were lovely too.  All so friendly and sweet.

We got there a half hour after they opened, and there was only one family in there ordering before us.  Three tables were already on reserve though.  When we started eating, the restaurant packed up pretty quickly.

Love this place and will definitely make the drive to go back."}
{"text":"This place has POUTINE. For those of you who have never had this drunken Quebec delight--cheese curds, gravy, and french fries. Glllrrrrbbbl. 

Also, the shrimp and egg sandwich comes on a massive roll with shrimp for days. The people who work here are all from Quebec I believe, and the kid at the register makes me chortle like a Swedish schoolboy every time I'm here.

The food is bonzer but can be a little pricey if you're not careful. The desserts are ALL good (try the 'beaver balls' or whatever they are called) and the prices on those are low. 

They have a couch you can sit on and Ikea furniture that bows under the weight of my apparently massive body. The walls are bland and poorly decorated but they have a fireplace (lol...) inside here. On the mantle lie a few books and games that are related to the family's local and ancestral roots. 

My only regret is that it's not open late at all, considering Poutine is the greatest drunk food of all time."}
{"text":"I am so incredibly disappointed after seeing 4 stars on yelp...I was so excited to try this place and when I saw they were highly rated for restaurant week, it made it even better. 

We called and asked if a reservation was required, and thank GOD we did! The owner had answered our call and told us 7:45. We got there at 7:35 and there were at least 4 groups awaiting and a line out the door. The owner was greeting people and telling those without a reservation there was at least a 40 minute wait. As we stood there I noticed that at 85% of the tables, most people were just sitting with no food. I should have realized at this point I should have left. As busy as it was there was literally 3 tables that were dirty, and the busser was slower then molasses, by 8:10 we were finally sat yet were still waiting water, menus and utensils. The waitress takes our order by 8:22 and we wait...then wait some more...

At 8:41 my boyfriend's soup (horseradish potato which was hot and \"pretty good\")comes out along with the soda I ordered at 20 minutes ago. By the way, its RC and its FLAT. At 8:39, I flagged down our waitress and asked for my boyfriend's glass of wine...still waiting. At 8:48, my peirogie appetizer finally arrives, two bites into it and they are COLD. Needless to say I am really trying to be patient, I ask the busser to please send over the waitress. I sent back my app and when it comes back, instead of making me new ones they just resteamed the ones that were cold. I didn't think they were so spectacular, I have had better at our restaurants in the valley. 

My boyfrend at this point finds this whole experience comical so he is now timing how quickly food is coming out since it is literally coming out one plate at at time, not even kidding! 

At 9:02 ONE of our meals comes to the table, the other plate arrives at 9:10, We both ordered Schnitzel cordon bleu and came with other sides...both of our potatoes being cold, as in NOT luke warm. Personally, I was NOT a fan of this dish and picked it at. My boyfriend on the other hand enjoyed it.  At 9:17 the waitress finally comes to check on us.I am trying to be nice but I am so over this experience. By 9:24 the owner stops over and although very nice explains that the ticket printer backed up and when they finally got it working there were tickets everywhere and offered me dessert. I replied \"no, thank you because it comes with my meal\". At 9:37 the waitress comes back with our desserts, and we make a comment about the ticket printer and she replies with \"Oh, I didnt hear that happened but could be\"..so we ate our dessert, I order the crepe with ligonberry sauce. Crepes were tasteless, glad the ligonberries were tart to add flavor....we paid the check and left.

In conclusion, I am usually a fair and patient person especially because I am a business owner myself so I try to give local business a thumbs up,  however this experience gets two thumbs down as not only did I observe poor customer service but to sit and get excuses over 2 hours tells me there is a problem in the kitchen let alone need more staffing during a week such a resturant week, this just cant handle this much business aside from the food being mediocre. I gave them two stars one for effort and because my boyriend liked it. This is on my personal no go list."}
{"text":"This was our second visit and were highly disappointed.  I ordered the Chicken w/ Cardamom Sauce.The meal was over priced and the portions were tiny. I asked for double broccoli and received 2 small pcs. The chicken was flavorful but again barely 4 strips of meat that  weighed  less than 3 oz.

 My husband had the 9 Pc. Pierogi meal which were suppose to be 3 different kinds but unfortunately it was only 1 of 1 kind and 8 of another plus they were cold and not fresh Being raised in families that made their own we know the difference."}
{"text":"Finally I had a chance to check this place out for lunch.  I was intrigued to find a Scandinavian restaurant in town since I'm from Norwegian heritage.  I ordered the meatball sandwich with the potato salad which was really delicious!!  The place was clean, the service was friendly, and I love the fact that they have games to play while you eat.  Just a cute little Mom and Pop restaurant.  I can't wait to return and try out some different dishes."}
{"text":"This is one my favorite places to eat - the schnitzel is awesome, the beet salad always leaves me wanting more. Their golumpki is good  although a bit heavier on meat than I prefer ( My mom does it better , naturally ). It certainly isn't health food - lots of fried, lots of cream, butter etc - but ingredients always taste fresh. 

I feel terrible for the people who wrote bad reviews about this place - I can only say that they must have hit the Beaver on a bad night. To be fair - food service has never been quick - it is a mom and pop place, and I suspect they must have struggled a bit with the new larger location. I don't care though - the food is good, the people are nice, and I'm glad to support them. I have no doubt they will be back to the top of their game now that a month or two has gone by in the new place!"}
{"text":"One of the premier places for European cuisine, not only is the menu extensive but also a delight to browse. The alcohol is all exotic and unique, perfect for anybody with a penchant for adventure. I have ordered something new multiple times and left highly satisfied on each occasion. If you pass this place over, I would hope you have an extremely good reason."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Their wraps are unique and fresh.  I was surprised that a Swedish/Canadian fusion restaurant had such good falafel; better than some middle eastern restaurants in town.  But hands down my favorite thing on the menu is the poutine.  It's the only place I know of in town that makes it. For those of you who don't know, poutine is french fries topped with hot brown gravy and cheese curds.  It's like the French-Canadian version of chili cheese fries, and it's delicious.  Beaver's Choice is definitely a must try, even if its just for a late night poutine snack!"}
{"text":"Tonight was our second visit to Beavers Choice and both times the food was fantastic. The Pierogis are many and varied and quite delicious. The Schnitzel is superb! It's a great place to cool off in summer with traditional food and drink, and we will return."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful! Nothing trendy, not a chain, or anything remotely like one. The atmosphere was a little quirky but who cares? The food was like a Scandinavian grandma would make. Absolutely delicious!

And the chicken schnitzel was to-die-for!"}
{"text":"The food is very good we had Swedish meatballs , schnitzel parm, and the chicken schnitzel also had dumpling appetizer all came out quick and hot. We ordered two sangrias and a Dr Pepper never got those bar staff was busy playing host nevertheless  great food just need to work on a few things will go back for the food ."}
{"text":"I can't claim to be any type of expert on Scandinavian or Polish cuisine.  And while I will admit to loving me some poutine, I have yet to order it from here.  The reason for that is primarily because the rest of the manu is so danged delicious and Canada is just not that far away.

The Shoemaker's Box... oh dear.  It's roasted pork loin on a pillow of mashed potatoes with chopped bacon, mushrooms, and leeks on top.  It comes with a side of tomato-basil and housemade pickles.  I'm not a pickles person but the pickles!

The cabbage rolls... super tender.  There's that bit of sourness from the red sauce that offsets the savoriness of the pork and the onions.  Delicate and great texture.  Pick your sides for these from the list.

But the one thing that absolutely make visits to Beaver Choice is the apple tart.  There's a seasonal German dessert called a fladen.  It's kind of like a fruit pie but kind of not.  What makes a fladen amazing is a super soft and only slightly sweet crust that is ridiculously amazing.  The apple tarts here are like personal serving apple fladens, except single serving is a slight misnomer because they're huge.  Still, add the scoop of ice cream because ice cream.  I would come to Beaver Choice for the apple tart alone.

The service I've received here every time has been spectacular.  Food does take time to come up but considering the quality, that's not a huge problem.  At some point, I will try the poutine here.  I will order the poutine after I've tried everything else on the menu and I will still order an apple tart with ice cream for dessert."}
{"text":"This place was incredible!! Reminded me of being in Israel with their schnitzel  so yummy!! I don't like mushrooms and there mushroom sauce was awesome. My father had the Swedish meatballs, said they were great! Theirs periogis reminded him of true polish food!"}
{"text":"I'm the kind of person that gets overzealous at a restaurant and wants to try EVERYTHING. (I think it stems from the all the Lazy Susans loaded with Chinese food from my childhood). The more options I've never seen on the menu, the more I want to order it. Unfortunately, my stomach does have certain anatomical limitations. This is where Beaver Choice comes with the perfect solution for people like me. 

Let me tell ya - I love a place that does sample platters, and the Swedish Sampler Plate is PERFECT. You can choose 3 from Swedish Meatballs, Swedish Hash (Pytt i Panna), Gravlax, and the mini Shoe Maker's Box, and it comes with beet salad, potato salad, broccoli, house slaw, and house salad. It really gives you the cream of the crop here! I opted for everything but the Swedish meatballs. The highlight for me was the Swedish Hash. The meaty options are perfectly balanced with the variety of side salads. Trust me - you will NOT be bored, for sure!

We also tried the regular schnitzel, which was pretty good! I've been to some schnitzel spots in Vienna so this wasn't a huge highlight for me, but I definitely want to come back to try the signature Schnitzel Cordon Bleu!!!! 

At this point, we were all pretty stuffed, but we HAD to make room for the Beaver Supreme. OMG am I glad we did. I don't love super sweet desserts and this did just the trick for me. After a pretty heavy and filling meal, the light chocolate meringue layered with nuts, whipped cream, and mandarin oranges is the perfect final touch. It's not overwhelmingly sweet, the meringue is crispy in the top layers, but chewy towards the bottom; the nuts add a nice crunch; the whipped cream is so light and fluffy while not being too sugary; and the mandarin oranges add another layer of interest and tang. You have got to leave room for this if you come by! 

All this food for 3 people was more than enough! We went home with enough for a meal (well...midnight snack) for all 3 of us. 

Oh, and drinks! SKOL!! How delightful to see imports from Europe. We got the Karlovacko Pilsner (Croatia), Warka Radler (Poland), and strawberry lime Rekorderlig (Sweden). This, and some lovely conversation with the Swedish family that runs the place made for such an enjoyable dining experience (S/O to Chris for being a wonderful server!). I definitely recommend EVERYONE come check this place out. I will certainly be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Beavers Choice is a bad choice. I had wanted to try this place for ages. I finally got the chance to go tonight and WILL NEVER GO AGAIN. It started OK the complimentary perogies they brought out were crisp and hot. I got the all you could eat perogies and the soup was great the Swedish coleslaw was OK the perogies were cold and nasty. My friend ordered flying Johnny. It is the nastiest mess of chicken, bananas, one lone peanut and a nasty sweet tomato sauce the kindest comparison is the sauce on canned ravioli. The only high light was the side of beet salad. The waiter never checked back on us and we had to have another waiter take away the flying Johnny. It was not removed from the bill and my friend was not offered to order something else. Over all a very disappointing experience. Inattentive service, cold or yuck tasting food. Don't bother going."}
{"text":"Low on ambiance but the food is so flavorful, fresh and very well executed.  This is a casual storefront - order at the counter but pay when you are finished.  I had the Laxpudding which the menu says is one of the oldest Swedish dishes - cured salmon with pickled onion and cucumbers on a bed of sliced fried potatos.  It came with a sweet pickled mustard relish which was to die for.  The 3 small sides were equally flavorful.  We also had a huge plate of sausage hash topped with a fried egg and the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon Bleu which was delicately fried, tender, and delicious.  This is one of Howard Seftel's top 10 dishes of 2010 and for good reason.

Next up - lunch!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined on a Saturday night around 5:30pm and by 6:30pm all tables were full and there was a wait. Which is great for Beaver Choice, but they don't really know how to handle that large of a crowd, or the guests who had to wait. Normally, if you have to wait at a restaurant, it's no big deal. But all the guests waiting seemed so annoyed, and I think it's because the staff was so flustered and nervous. The first thing they asked us when we walked in was if we had a reservation, which we didn't, but what was weird was that like 3 different people asked us and no one knew where we should sit. 

Anyway, besides the awkwardness of the staff, our server was great and able to explain the whole menu, the food was good (my pierogies were cold so I sent them back but the second round were cold too...I just ate them anyway), and the portions were enormous.

It seems that this mom and pop shop is getting too big for them to handle, if they hire a few more experienced servers and a really good hostess, get a host stand so guests aren't awkwardly standing in the middle of the restaurant when they walk in, and train themselves a bit more on customer service, I think they will do just great."}
{"text":"Great food. Service not good.  Waitress was unpleasant and would not accept the fact that she had mistakenly taken order down incorrectly. Really quite rude. Couldn't find menus for the 3 of us. Told us we need to share !!!"}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp for leading me to a delightfully different lunch today. While a bit pricey for the government worker lunch budget, it was one of those meals that you feel was worth it for at least the occasional splurge.  The owner was on hand and was very welcoming and solicitous of my return.  I had the house specialty schnitzel, pork variety I believe, and was pleased with taste, and moist tender texture. The serving size was more than adequate but if I had been really hungry, I might have wanted for more.  At over $15, a little pricey for my meager lunch budget, but given the obvious quality of the food and care in preparation, and several other items on the menu I'd like to try - I shall return!  I noted also there are a couple specials nights per week that might even be worth the considerable drive from NW Phx to give a try.  I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Atmostphere: None.
Service: Counter service. Friendly, in a swedish kinda way.
Food: Ok - I had the chicken wrap.

It took 30 minutes to get a chicken wrap. 30 minutes. And it was not crowded. It tasted pretty good. I assume it took 30 minutes because they were waiting for the chicken to mature enough to slaughter it, butcher it, dress it and cook it to put in my wrap.

30 minutes for a chicken wrap? Really?"}
{"text":"I used to visit them when they were on Broadway and it always took too long so even though the food was always amazing we stopped going because of the delays. now this new place is something completely different, very quick service and the food was just a amazing as it always has been. Beaver's choice make the best schnitzel I've had in the USA(other then my own ;-)) and I would recommend it to anybody with a need for healthy good nutritious food any day."}
{"text":"Seemed a little pricey at first, but ended up taking half of it home! Quality and quantity totally make it worth it. I got the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu with polish potato dumpling and it was great! The sides were home made and delicious as well. Customer service was fine - other waiters/waitresses seemed more talkative than ours, but ours was still quick and offered good recommendation. Wish I could've saved room for dessert!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent. One of the best meals we have ever eaten. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the service was not that good. The owner was the only person waiting tables for about an hour and a half. Couldn't order mixed drinks because the bartender wasn't there. Help finally arrived but still no one took our drink order. 

We will definitely go back because the choice of food is very good and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Fabulous home cooked European/Canadian food!  Got the Pierogi's and Schnitzel Parmigiana!  The owner is so attentive and talks to the patrons.  Feels really welcoming.  Don't come here expecting to be in and out.  They actually cook their food, and GREAT food takes time!  Enjoy the company around you!!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent! I had the falafel pita and wanted to die of happiness mid-first-bite. The desserts looked yummy, too. The staff here is amazingly friendly as well.

The food does take a while (at least 20 minutes) and there isn't a ton of seating. Of course, I love waiting for food and I hardly ever go out to eat with a part over 4, so this doesn't bother me at all. I will return to Beaver Choice again and again. :-)"}
{"text":"I work nearby and my coworkers and I have been eyeing this place from Ted's Hot Dogs for a few weeks now. A co-worker and I finally decided to check it out today and I'm so glad we did!
It seems that all new customers are automatically entitled to try a free sample plate with potato salad, beet salad, and salmon. I'm not a salmon person, but both salads were really good. I had the meatball sub with potato salad from the Grab and Go Menu, which was pretty amazing. I admit to anticipating the potato salad as a side instead of a part of the sandwich, but the flavors worked together really well, so I didn't mind. My co-worker had the chicken pita, also from the Grab and Go Menu, and really enjoyed the marinated chicken. We shared an order of the Quebec Poutin (cheesy, gravy smothered fries), which was AMAZING (all caps). They even gave us a medium order instead of the small we actually ordered due to wait time (which, compared to most places was virtually non-existent). 
And that brings me to the service...You order at the register and, as the guy behind the counter noted, that is the only \"self-serve\" portion of the experience. The food is delivered as it becomes ready, and there are free refills. All of the staff were genuinely nice and very helpful. We even got the history behind the name and the mascot (I'll leave it to you to ask when you go). The atmosphere was clean and refreshing, with local art on the walls. Overall, the experience was...(you guessed it) amazing!!! Can't wait to go back and try the dinner/bistro menu soon!"}
{"text":"Just...what...how? But...I just... Ahh this place is so so good! From the cheery greetings from the sweet Swedish family running the joint to those mouth watering, melt-in-your mouth Swedish meatballs, this place is seriously the bees knees.  Like, I could take a bath in the meatball gravy all day long. Thats how good this place is. Make sure you go when you have plenty of time - they make everything homemade just for you with plenty of care (and magic, methinks), so sometimes you just gotta wait. The ambience has sort of a cafeteria feel, but do not let this fool you! You are literally sitting in a gold mine of tasty treats. My husband really likes the pork schnitzel cordon bleu, and I think they said it was their most popular meal. Gosh, if you haven't been to Beaver Choice, please go right now. Cancel your meetings and hair appointments and kids' soccer games. All of that can wait in the name of delicious Swedish meat!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to this place on New Year's Eve, we called ahead because we did not have a reservation and they assured us that they would be able to squeeze us in at the bar.   Upon arrival we were greeted by very friendly staff and seated right away at the bar. (We enjoy sitting at the bar, we could have waited for a table.)  After reviewing the menu, we already decided to return even before trying the food because the menu looked so great.  When the food came out, it was delicious.  I had the laxpudding which was similar to a salmon frittata and it was amazing.  My husband went with their signature dish, the schnitzel.  Overall, the food was fresh and really great.  I would definitely go back and recommend others try!"}
{"text":"They had me at Kopytka!  My childhood favorite of all time. The food was authentic and brought back good memories. There was so much goodness on the menu to choose from, that I had a difficult time making my selection. It all looked amazing and I can't wait to go back. As the sun set, the restaurant did get a bit hot, but everything was clean and the owner/staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Nice family owned restaurant with a great mix of European foods. They provide generous portions and their Bison Grass Vodka is exceptional. The proprietor comes out and mingles with the guests and many of those working are relatives so they really care about their customers. They even have all you can eat Pierogi night which I believe is on Thursdays. Be careful because they close during the summer months as I think they go to Europe so please verify they're open if visiting in the summer.

My only negative comment preventing me from giving them a full 5 stars is both their selection of Pierogi's and that they fry them too much. Definitely go with the boiled/steamed pierogi's because the fried ones taste more like fried wontons than pierogis. Next time I'll ask if they can boil and then lightly fry them to make them less hard."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and had the buffet.  Nice variety of options and they charge you by the pound.  Next week (Feb 2015) they will introduce a new lunch menu.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very cool little place. I'd never been to the old location, but this one has a good number of tables and boothes, a tiny bar w/ seating, and a small patio.

I came here w/ a large group and they were very accommodating, even when it came to split checks!

Theres nothing like starting out a meal by sharing some Quebec poutine w/ your Wonder Twin... Get your minds out of the gutter, kids! Quebec poutine is what they call their fries that come smothered in cheese curds and gravy. Delicious.

I also had the Polish sampler. You get a choice of 3 salads (dont worry, theyre tiny), the choice of a woodsmoked sausage or bratwurst, 3 pierogies, and a cabbage roll. I  grew up on this type of meal, so I was very interested to see if it was \"done right\". I.E. just like my cousins Nana used to make (she was straight off the boat).

The salads were great. I opted for the tomato basil, potato, and green. The patato was by far some of the best Ive had outside of a cookout. The pierogies were good, and Im usually not a fan of pan fried pierogies. I got 2 cheese and potato and one cabbage mix. Even the golumpki (actually what a cabbage roll is called) was good. I grew up hating these, but the meat filling in this one was a very nic compliment to the not overly cooked cabbage on the outside. My Mom would be so proud that I ate the whole thing, though I didnt entirely care for the sauce they smothered it in. That sauce and my sausage being overdone are the only reason I gave this place 4 and not 5 stars.

I'd definitely recommend this place if youre a fan of old world comfort food. Gero apetito!"}
{"text":"Really good food! So impressed with the quality and amazing flavors. We are coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"So this place is kinda advertised as Scandinavian but I'd say it's really more international as they also have German, Polish and even French-Canadian food on the menu. 

My boyfriend and I started our dinner with poutine. If you don't know, poutine is French-Canadian and is fries topped with cheese curds and gravy. It was delicious! We quickly inhaled every gravy-covered bite.

For our entrees I went with the Shoe Maker's Box, which is basically pork loin with mashed potatoes topped with bacon, mushrooms and gravy. It was quite rich and very filling. They give you lots of potatoes! Overall it had a good flavor and the pork was cooked well.

My boyfriend went for the elk stew which is more like a stroganoff than a soup-like stew. Lots of meat served a top egg noodles. He really enjoyed it. The elk was a bit gamey for me. It was good but I don't know if I could have eaten more than a few bites.

For dessert we had the Beaver Supreme. It's an attractive desert and tasted good but the meringue made for a mess at the table. One cut in and crumbs flew everywhere. Glad we got it for the experience but next time I would probably order something else.

The service was good and the atmosphere is comfortable. I definitely want to go back to try their Swedish meatballs."}
{"text":"All we have to say is SCHNITZEL! It's fantastic. Large portions and friendly service. They were family friendly. We will come again. Our kids want to steal the chef."}
{"text":"Review #100 

        I knew I was coming up to the century mark here on Yelp, and I've been trying to think of what I'd want my hundredth to be... something different for sure... but I just wasn't coming up with anything. Then, on some random night, Kristen and I head out to Ted's Hot Dogs and there I see it... completely unassuming and somewhat hidden, a sign that reads \"Beaver Choice\". Remembering seeing it on Yelp a bit lately, I ask if we can, she nods, and we're off. Beaver Choice is one of those culinary miracles that I'm so glad I stumble upon occasionally, and I knew as soon as I left that it must be the illusive \"hundredth review\". 
        From the moment we walked in we felt like family... I'm a little surprised I didn't end up getting a hug, the people who run the establishment are bright and chock full of attitude, quirky attitude, if you don't have a lot of experience with people from different nations you could possibly see some of it as rude, just toughen up people, unless you're doing something silly, all they want to do is serve you well. 
        The atmosphere is nothing amazing, this is not The Palm, but it is very homey, it feels like you're walking into someones dining room. A lot of the furniture and dining accessories are from Ikea, which is cute because it's from Sweden, and they have a bunch of games you can play while you wait, they aren't trying to pretend they're a quick restaurant, everything is fresh and can take a while. 
        The food! The food is amazing. Everything I've had from the coleslaw to the potatoes to the meatballs has been wonderful. I wholeheartedly recommend the pork schnitzel cordon bleu, this thing was so simple and tasty, it's not some over-sauced or over-seasoned dish, it's fresh, quality food that speaks for itself without being covered up by a million ingredients. Also high on the list are the supremely flavorful swedish meatballs, get a chunk of meat on your fork, plow it through the potatoes then dip it in the lingonberry preserve and let me know how heaven was. The coleslaw is not your typical slaw, it is house made and much better, the thyme potatoes came in a huge portion and were delish, and the tomato basil salad was tasty even to a guy who hates tomatoes, like me. 
          I'm not sure how much more I could drool over this place... huge portions, very good food, fair pricing and amazing staff. Beaver Choice just has it all."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE......price, service, food, experience.  WILL NEVER RETURN.  
The doors were unlocked and there were people in there eating.  Then the owner came out of the back and said we are closed until 5 pm.  It was 4:30.  I guess proof that the service is horrible and slow was that lunch ends at 2 and they are closed from 2-5 but the couple at the table was still there eating.  Anyways they did let us come in and they offered us a glass of water...that took 15 minutes to get to the table.  When a server finally arrived through the front door all sweaty, he came to bring us menus.  Now it is 5:15. He brought us water and then started to take it away because we already had some, we asked him if we could keep it and it was a good thing we did as he never came back to refill glasses.  He never asked if we wanted anything else to drink and we were going to order a new kind of beer.  We ordered.  It was. 40 minutes before the first plate came and we had no silverware....when we asked the server said, no I gave you flatware already, really? do you see any here? another 10 minutes before the second plate came out and it was cold and was sent back.  There was a bone chip in the sausage.  At each table you could here the servers saying they were out of pierogies and then they were out of baklava, then they were out of......the owner lady started chatting at tables and told everyone she was out of pierogies because she only makes them on Tuesday her prep day..it was Friday.   So all the food must be leftover if she only preps on Tuesday.  VERY DISAPPOINTED, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.  my one star rating is one star too much, but the lowest score you can give.."}
{"text":"First thing's first - I picked the wrong night to try this place. I do think it has potential and hopefully future visits will earn a higher mark.

It was a Thursday night, I called at 6pm. Was told it would be 90 minutes. I was planning on picking up and my friend wanted a nap, so okay, I said I would wait. 90 minutes later I call and it's still not ready. So I asked that they call me when it was ready and about 15-20 mins after that they called. 

When I got to the restaurant I asked what's up with the 2 hour wait? (My order was only a chicken schnitzel, and another but cordon bleu style...seems pretty simple). I was told they got slammed with one group of 6 and another group of 8. There were at least 3 workers in the kitchen, along with 2 up front. I was honestly baffled as to how it could take so long. Anyway, I asked if in the future I should call earlier than 6pm and was assured that no, they are usually not so busy and it was just an off night. I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt here. They are nice people and I understand new places need some time to find their \"groove\".

On to the food: I had the chicken schnitzel which was very nicely breaded and a HUGE portion. I got two meals out of it. It was topped with a very tasty mushroom gravy. On the side I had broccoli that was perfectly cooked, and the creamy dill potatoes. I was surprised that other reviews mentioned the food being salty, because I had to add salt to my potatoes. They were really good cold the next day! On the side there was also cole slaw (yum!) and green bean salad (meh).

My friend got the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu and devoured it. He got the mashed potatoes on the side. We both thought they lacked flavor. The creamy dill potatoes were definitely the better of the two.

I'd like to try some of their lunch items. Also since I know they read these reviews, I want to request some meatless pierogies...potato, cheese & onion....oh that would be so good. Pretty please? :)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with two friends. We arrived right at opening time (noon on Sunday) and, as expected, there was a bit of a wait for our food. But the wait was definitely worth it! With such an interesting menu I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is always great but service never is. There is typically only one waiter who is doing the best he can while basically covering the entire restaurant. The owner (who was covering the bar) forgot to make our drinks on our last trip there so we ended up drinking water with our meal."}
{"text":"Great home cooked food. Family run and everything is fresh. Also byob (1 bottle of wine or 2 beers). Only negative is atmosphere."}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good!! Little pricy for the area but if you got a lil extra change definitely a good choice! Something different and pleasing and the perogies are sooooo good! Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Woooooo beavers choice!!! We havent even had the food yet but this place is totally awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great Polish, Scandinavian, Canadian, food.  Yup that's right they got all that.  Several dishes I can't pronounce.  Schnitzel(sp?) is good,  Cabbage rolls good,  Sausage good,  Perogies(sp?) good.  Lots of selection and everything I've had so far has been really good."}
{"text":"we have been wanting to eat here for quite a while and today we finally made it. We should have kept waiting. My wife had the schnitzel and I had the lox. Hers was just a slab of breaded chicken with what taste like canned mushroom soup. My lox, well I had 1 bite and that was all it took. It tasted like it was made 2 weeks ago and left in the fridge. Now taste is subjective and I realize that. What made sure I will NEVER go back to try something else is when we told the server I didn't care for the fish she  (eventually) took the plate away and charged for it anyway! If you're looking for something a little different I would strongly suggest you pass on this place."}
{"text":"Our first time in. We weren't sure what we'd get, but when we saw in other reviews that they  had schnitzel we thought we'll give them a try. So glad we did!  Place is clean, waitress very friendly. But mostly ~ the food was awesome! Schnitzel's come w/ your choice of three side 'salads' and your choice of starch side.  I had the pickled beets, sauerkraut and potato salad for my three sides, with the dill whipped potatoes as a starch. The schnitzels came in lunch size and dinner size. I ordered the Cordon Bleu Pork schnitzel. How they got the ham and cheese inside that pork steak is a great question, but they did and it was awesome. Hubby had the Jagar Schnitzel and let me taste his, as great as mine was. The owner came out while we were there and went to most tables to stop in and say hi, I think she knew just about all of them! Having been to Germany and had Schnitzel made right, I was thinking i'd have to go back to Germany to find anywhere that would make them that good. I'm happy I've found this place, much cheaper than plane tickets! I recommend."}
{"text":"We were very excited to go to Beaver Choice as we saw online that they offered an Oktoberfest menu which made my German heart sing. The whole day I dreamed about creamed herring and Bavarian kraut. It had to stay a dream.
When we entered we were greeted and told to sit wherever. After a while our waiter came and brought water and menus. We were scanning the menu for the promised Oktoberfest but nothing. We asked and our waiter said that Oktoberfest special is over and that they just didn't update their website. Bummer! I was seriously annoyed, you can't promise me creamed herring and then don't deliver! That's just cruel! 
We decided once we are here we might as well eat something else. The prices threw us a bit off, but we still ordered the herring appetizer, the elk stew and the all you can eat Pierogi with soup and salad.
Aaaaand another bummer! Three to be exact. 
The Pierogi were all potato filled. Potato bacon, potato onions, potato cheese... I know Pierogi to have mushroom filling, or meat, but only potato is really really boring after the first few bites. They were overall rather bland. The soup was potato horseradish and tasted really good but the big pot to self serve was almost empty so I only got a little bit. The salad was only greens, not a slice of tomato or cucumber or anything. I skipped that.
The herring was incredibly salty and sweet. It costs you about $10 and what you get is about half a herring filet, one potato, some diced red onion and sour cream. For TEN dollars. You can get this pickled herring in a jar at IKEA for $2.50. 
The elk stew smelled and tasted delicious but it only had minuscule pieces of elk meat in it (we're talking pieces the size of fingernail clippings) and was just scooped over a copious amount of mashed potatoes (we ordered Polish dumplings but got mashed potatoes). It didn't look too appetizing, but it tasted good - yet the price of $20 was definitely too much for it. 
The reason why after all that complaining here they still get three stars are the desserts. We ordered the sampler with lemon fluff, vanilla custard and Polish cheesecake and it was really good. Especially the custard was so rich and flavorful. They get a whole star plus for that. 
So, if we ever have some money to spare to pay for overpriced mediocre food we will come back (my husband wants to see how many Pierogi he can eat...), but I will concentrate on the desserts then."}
{"text":"On a fine Saturday had to make it out to this spot I kept hearing Beaver Choice is the best... I entered the restaurant everyone was so friendly you could tell everyone cared about what they were doing and wanted to put out the best product they could. I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel Cordon-Bleu (Half a pound double chicken schnitzel stuffed with French brie cheese and black forest ham served with a mushroom sauce. Severed with one side I went with the Pan Fried Thyme Potatoes along with three side salads I went with the Homemade Coleslaw, Marinated Green Beans and Sauerkraut... It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time it's hard to find home cooked meals when you're not at home. I will be back for sure I still need to try a beaver cookie."}
{"text":"I'd had this place bookmarked for a while and was really looking forward to trying it out. I finally got a chance when I took a date, and we both loved the place. We were informed (by the owner, I think) that their wait staff was short that night, and our particular server was new, but that didn't really hinder the experience. My date and I had a difficult time choosing our food because everything looked so good. The complimentary pierogies were yummy and unexpected. We decided on the elk stew, chicken schnitzel cordon bleu, and blue cheese stuffed mushrooms. All were fantastic! The ambiance is nice, but not fancy, and they have a good amount of outdoor seating in booths, which we liked. They have a pretty vast selection of foreign beers, too. We already can't wait to go back and try more menu items!"}
{"text":"We went early to Beaver Choice.  What kind of a name is that?  There were five of us.  You he early birds received 5 perogies on the table and ate them when we arrived we asked for some more and to our horror the waiter declined.  They only give you the exact number of people at the table.
Then we wanted to split the meal and there is a $5 charge.  We were told by the owner all restaurants do this.  They have to pay to get wash the extra dish and more.  What bull**it.  The staff's attitude is horrible!
The servings are huge!  Healthy but enormous, hence splitting a plate really is enough.
The food is very good but the hassle is almost not worth the bother.
Next time and I will go back because the food is good,
I am going to bring my own extra plate and take the plate home so they don't have to wash it, better yet I'll bring a paper plate and toss it in the trash on my way out!"}
{"text":"This was some of the best food I have had in a restaurant.  It has a very home-cooked quality.  The mushroom sauce on the chicken schnitzel was so good.  The Swedish meatballs were very flavorful.  I like that you can choose up to 4 sides with each dish so that you can get a good taste for all the different items on the menu.  We can't wait to go back and try the Flying Jacob dish, but it takes 45 minutes to prepare.  Although this restaurant is very casual and not fancy at all, it can get quite crowded on a weekend evening so be prepared to reserve a table in advance.  Also, bring your own wine/beer.  There is a $5 corking fee which is waived if you bring your own glasses."}
{"text":"So um we really, really wanted some Swedish meatballs one day. Then low and behold we landed at Beaver Choice. Best. Accident. Ever.

This is a family owned business. We were the only guests. The Scandianvian son fawned on us. We had to sample EVERYTHING. I mean we had two heaping full plates of samples, before we were allowed to order. He insisted! It was so amazingly awkward. 

Truly though, very gracious people. It's a gem of a place."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying, that I loved my food. Let me also start out by saying that our table waited so long for our food that I am pretty sure I would've eaten my own eye if you'd served it to me.
Walking in to the restaurant, we were roundly ignored by the staff and left to stand in the middle of the restaurant and look pitiful. AWKWARD! When we were finally seated, it took 1/2 an hour to receive water. Another 10 to get menus. Another 20 to order, then the pacing of the meal when we finally got our food was weird. Our server was incredibly odd and vacillated between incredibly intrusive and absolutely dismissive. It took one of our friends almost a full 20 minutes after we received our food to get her beer. 
However, the food really was good. We ordered poutine and it was delicious. However, our waiter insisted on correcting our pronunciation of \"poutine\". 

Me- \"I'd like a small poo-tin, please\"
Him- \" You mean, the POOOTEEN?\"

Actually, I speak French and it's not POOOTEEN. Even if it was, don't be a pretentious butthead. 

At any rate, great food but the service needs A LOT of work. But I will be back, if only for the POOTEEN."}
{"text":"Okay, I literally just sat down after eating here and had to write this review. Aaamazing.

My boyfriend and I were at home deciding whether it was worth the effort to get up and go get dinner, due to the disgusting heat of course, and I decided to check out Yelp and see what sounded good enough to get me out the door. Found this place, and he had been there before, given he literally lives across the street. (This is now a dangerous, dangerous thing given how much I loved this place.)

Everyone who works here: super nice. We chatted for quite a while when placing our order and even got a recommendation for a Thai place down the road. I ordered the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu, my boyfriend ordered pork schnitzel. Everything was fantastic. You get three salads and a side, my side was mashed potatoes (lots of dill, yummm) and I got sauerkraut, the potato salad and peas (I ended up getting the basil tomatoes when served by mistake, which actually was fine because they were delish...only thing that was \"wrong\" with our visit, which is not a big deal at all to me). Ended up taking half of my schnitzel home, the portions were super generous. We got a Beaver cookie and two of the chocolate balls to take home...just as amazing as dinner. We have already decided we're going back next weekend (I'm thinkin' meatballs and pierogies) and I have a feeling we will be there a lot in the future...this place is awesome! Anyone who complains about the wait time...maybe it's just me but I'd rather wait a half hour for quality food than the alternative. This isn't fast food...go to McDonald's if you only have five minutes to wolf down something."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE visiting with Ms. Hannah, and eating amazing food prepared with love, pride and craftsmanship.  Our current favorite, is Perogi nite!!![Thursday nite...all the perogis you can eat!]   Whenever we go, the restaurant is a clean well lighted place. Their servers are attentive, accurate, and very proud of their product. We've tried a variety of the meals.  My absolute favorite are the potato and jalapeno perogis.  AMAZING.  What is truly the one thing that sets this restaurant apart from others ... is Ms. Hannah!  We always feel like we're visiting family and she greets us like we've been missed. 
Go alone, with a sweetheart or a big group ... and tell her I told you to ask about her Perogi machine!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for a Saturday night dinner with 4. We were seated promptly by the owner and she's very friendly and sweet. The food is amazing! Pierogis galore and were all delicious. The Swedish meatballs were soooo good. Dessert was perfect. We will be back again and again and again. It's just that good!"}
{"text":"Yes really one star...there food is generous portions (albeit very salty), cheap and pretty tasty. However operationally they are an EPIC fail. The three of us waited 5 minutes for drinks, 20 minutes for the first entree, additional 10 minutes for second entree and even an additional 10 minutes for the third entree. Orders were wrong, some of the food was cold (e.g. peas, etc.), never got offered refills, ordering is slow confusing arduous process, fishing for entrees (server doesn't know who has what), all empty tables were filthy (we started to clean the one we were sitting at), etc.  I could be forgiving given that the this is a strip mall bistro but not with everything going wrong (especially the wait times). They could really use Gordon Ramsey to fix the operational problems. 

Other than being tasty the food was good including the Swedish meatballs, pork schnitzel and hash entrees (the hash was especially salty and even on the spicy side). The sides ranged from mediocre (e.g. cold peas) to pretty decent (e.g. pan fried potatoes, mashed potatoes, slaw, etc.). The plates are large and full and certainly could be shared between two people and the price is pretty reasonable.  However it is just tough to get around dirty tables and the wait. So unless I am itching for Swedish food I'll pass on Beaver Choice."}
{"text":"By far the best Schnitzel I've ever had in my life!!!! My fiancee and I just moved to Arizona from Pennsylvania, and we always talked about how much we missed our favorite Austrian restaurant from PA. After some searching on Yelp, we decided to try Beaver Choice, and I am SO happy that we did! The Viking Schnitzel was absolutely incredible - again, the best I've ever had...In my life - and the pierogies were pan fried to perfection! We had an excellent experience with the staff, and I will be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"First timer -- great place to eat if you want to try something different.  I had the Vladimir chicken and it was delicious.  Dessert is also amazing"}
{"text":"Had captains fish and poutine...both were very good.  The sauerkraut tasted homemade and the cheese Kurds were different!  The place is run by a small Swedish family, very friendly but amateurs for sure; adds to the charm of the place.  Very small only 4 to 5 tables from ikea :-)
Not really vegetarian friendly though no surprise there!  I would go again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having Scandanavian food and it was amazing! I highly recommend the shoemaker box as well as the stuffed mushrooms! The pierogi were also good, especially the jalepeño! Portions were generous so I'll have to get dessert next time 
Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Beaver Choice
745 W Baseline Rd
Mesa, AZ 85210

Five of us along with a three year old visited the restaurant on a Thursday night to take advantage of the all you can eat pierogi offer. Having written reviews for many years, this restaurant presented me with a number of dilemmas in evaluating it.

The food represents a number of disparate countries including Germany, Sweden, Poland and Canada. While the food was tasty, the choices on the menu often led to confusion in ordering, with customers wanting to change around a lot of dishes to suit their tastes. Fortunately, we had an excellent waitress who did her best to keep everyone happy.

I ordered the all you can eat Pierogis, which comes with soup and salad. The salad is in a bowl on a table at the end of the room, and is quite ordinary. The dressing is in two squirt bottles that sit in a bowl of ice. The dressing is quite tasty, but the seasonings in it blocked the spout, and then suddenly shot out of the bottle drenching the salad. 

Next, was the soup. It was kept in an electric kettle with a broken lid. The soup was a traditional European style borscht which had a chicken broth base, cabbage and thick sliced beets. It was an excellent soup, though I would have preferred that the beets were cut up a lot smaller and thinner.

What should have been the high point of my dinner was a bunch of gummy, thick dough pirogi's in a selection of only 4 types. When I inquired about the selection since they advertise all you can eat, I was told that they only put out 4 types because they can't keep up with the demand. In the hour and a half that I was there, I never once observed the pans of pirogi's get low enough that they had to be refilled.

Companion had the Skomakarlada (Swedish Shoebox) which had a nice gravy and several nice medallions but which was buried under a huge mass of mashed potatoes. Companion had asked them to put some extra mushrooms on the plate, and was charged $1.75 for the mushrooms that none of us could find.

Another companion had the Hunter Schnitzel, which was a nice sized portion and came with two salads and a huge portion of mashed potatoes with gravy. A heavy plate to say the least.

One of our companions was a vegetarian and wanted the pirogi special, but was unable to eat the soup portion owing to its base of chicken broth.

The high point of the meal was the desserts. I had the Lingonberry Ice Cream which was excellent and the best part of my meal. A number of others in our party ordered the same thing after they saw mine. Companion had the Lemon Fluff, which was a beautifully done and excellent tasting meringue.

The bill was presented and I gave my Amex card. Their website says that they accept it. I was asked by our waitress to use a different card because Amex charges them 1% more than the other cards. When I refused, they told me they would charge me 5% more on the bill to cover my using Amex. This is the height of being cheap! Never in all my days reviewing restaurants have I ever been subjected to something like this. I have had places say that they don't accept Amex, and that is their privilege, but to add on a charge that isn't even close to what they get charged smacks of a place that is worried about every little dime and is worried about possibly closing.

I cannot in all honesty give this restaurant the rating that it should deserve. The food was very good, and the service was adequate, but the place was more than half empty, poorly decorated, and did not want to take a credit card that they clearly accept.

2 stars for quality of food and service."}
{"text":"Yuck. I don't know what was worse-- the service or the food! Don't waste your time or money!! I only tried the (small $11) poutine, so maybe the other food is different, but it was so soggy and bland! I could've made it better and I am a terrible chef. It took quite a while for the waitress to come to our table and the service just went downhill from there. Definitely won't be giving Beaver Choice a second chance."}
{"text":"We were at the Beaver on Wednesday May 24th. Their were 4 of us. Two were taking the advantage of restaurant week selection and two of us ordered off the menu. The service from the start of ordering beverages drinks was poor. Three received ore drink order 1 we had to ask 3 times for the last one. Our orders took over 1 hour to receive 2 of them and then another 15 minutes later. They messed up the salads and 1 never got their salad. We asked 4 times for the salad. We asked to speak to the owner and she hid out in the kitchen. They had 1 waiter/1 bus help and the owner for restaurant week and the place holds a minimum of 50 people. No excuses for this type of service. We were there 2 hours and 2 people who ordered the price fixe selection NEVER received their dessert. No apologies. While the food was ok, but certainly not worth such poor service and poorer business management"}
{"text":"I always like trying different food which is what led us to Beaver Choice. While the food worth trying I can't say I'll be retuning any time soon as the service is slow and the food is over priced. Lunch was $20 without any drinks."}
{"text":"I love the food!! I had the Swedish sampler since I didn't know what to get. Everything seemed so good! And it was! I tried a bit from my friends dishes too and they loved it. They had the rhubarb chicken. I was so engrossed in my food that I forgot to take pictures,sorry. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place.. so we gave it a try last night. No on greeted us so we sat ourselves.. Wait staff breezed by us numerous times, no recognition ... after about 15 minutes a lady with a German Accent came by, offered us Menus, then disappeared.. She stopped by the table about 10 minutes later, offered to take our orders. She was very friendly, offered to bring us a sample of the Stew and Meatballs.. A young man came to the table dropped off 2 deep fried perogis for a sample.. finally after another long wait the sample of stew arrived, the lady apologized it was in the window no on had brought it too us.. My husband decided on the Hash topped with a fried egg $14.95, I went with the house recommendation Pork Schnitzel Cordon Blue $17.95 .. the entree comes with three salad sides and potato choice I ordered Potato Dumpling, Sauerkraut, Beets and 
Green Salad, Husband had Sauerkraut, Beets, Potato Salad.  About 10 minutes later a young man came to the table they were out of the Polish Potato Dumpling !!! WHAT ?
I changed to couscous ( at a Scandinavian Restaurant with Schnitzel ?)

Food took a while, husbands hash came out first, huge serving of diced potato sprinkled with a tiny bit of minced hash.. topped with a cold rubbery egg. My food arrived about 5 minutes later. 

We began to eat.. Blah way over priced, $14.95 for 1 stinking egg and potato, my cordon bleu was less than stellar.. Thin slice pork with a tiniest bit of ham lunch meat I mean tiny I had to search for it. I ate the Schnitzel .. let the sided.. Everything is straight out of a can. Cold canned Sauerkraut, Pickled Beets your average grocery store variety, potato salad was okay but nothing Scandinavian about it potatoes and mayo.. Salad was some iceberg lettuce a few cucumber slices.. 

We spent over $30 for below average food.. The lady waiting in us turned out to be the owner, after placing our order we never saw her again, no one really gave any type of service .. 
The owner kept bragging how she is featured on the food channel.. hum?

This place is pricey for what you get. We will not be returning  anytime soon. If you like canned sauerkraut, green beans and beets stay home and save yourself some money."}
{"text":"So happy to find a place that makes delicious homemade polish food! We were seated right away when the doors were open. Even got serve complementary fried perogies and when we order the food came in a perfect time and was not disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. We had pan fried pierogis as an appetizer (excellent flavor,  well prepared). As an entree I had the schnitzel cordon blue with brocolli, cole slaw and thyme potatoes. All the items were delicious and well prepared. The potatoes weren't dry and the schnitzel was perfectly calibrated. My husband had the elk stew with sauerkraut. He enjoyed both but was particularly impressed with the fresh flavors of the sauerkraut. The servings were large and the wait staff was pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place due to it's high yelp rating, but sadly I was disappointed.  We came here on a Friday night.

Pros: The decor and service was nice.  The food was decent, may not be my favorite kind of cuisine though.

Cons: We got the elk stew ($18) and the the Shoemaker ($15).  These items were both quite overpriced to begin with.  There was very little meat in the elk stew and the \"slice of meat\" on the shoemaker was a tough piece of pork.  They gave me a butter knife to cut it.  That would've been okay if it had actually been at all tender, but it was the opposite. I pretty much had to stab it with my fork and eat caveman-style.  Again, most of both of our dishes consisted of mashed potatoes (which was the best part of the plate). You also were given no choice in the sides that accompanied it.  

Here's the ultimate putdown which brought this down to a 2 star instead of a 3.  When we got our bill, they had charged us $20 for the elk stew when the menu clearly stated $18.  WTH?  The only thing we can think of is that the waitress asked if we wanted pasta or potatoes and we went with the potatoes.  Was it an extra whole $2 for mashed potatoes (which would be ridiculous) or were we just getting screwed in general?  The meal came out to about $40, and that is without any drinks, apps, or desert.  $40 for less than 8 oz of meat between the two of us, 3 cups worth of mashed potatoes, and water."}
{"text":"You can spend a long time looking for a place like this and never find it. Food is delicious and sourced to the region it comes from.  The owners were present, kind and giving.  

This is a real hometown joint whose roots are present in a long line of delicious warmth and culinary excellence.  This place is from a time when food and restaurants were not created for catering to the bourgeoisie, the entitled culinary elite or the newest hip trend, but truly come from a long line of people teaching people about raising and cooking food, from an era of the boarding house and family restaurant within the family farmhouse.  This restaurant is an oasis in the dessert strip and chain of the Pheonix area."}
{"text":"Great food! We had the cordon blue schnitzel. Mine gluten free. Delicious! One of our group had the Hunter stew, which he enjoyed! As we are winter visitors, we are always looking for great places for dining. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place! Huge portions, great Swedish food with a Polish twist. The owners are super nice."}
{"text":"Dined here again and was pleasantly surprised to see that they added more dishes to their already delicious menu.  I tried a newer dish, swai fillet en papillote, and tasted some of the beef med lok (burger with sauteed onions).  The swai, baked in foil, was tender and moist, with a vibrant flavorful sauce.  The burger was excellent.  It had a nice slightly smoky flavor, and was perfectly grilled.  The sides, as always, are superb.  Service is always warm and friendly, and the family here really takes care of their customers, especially if you are a regular!  I am sad to see that they will be moving farther away from where I live (To Mesa, on the corner of Baseline and Extension) in February, but I'm excited for them.  The new location will be bigger in all aspects, from the kitchen to the dining room, with a nice outdoor patio, and will be full-service with a bar.  So enjoy the Tempe location while you can, and head on over to Mesa to enjoy their good eats when they move in February!"}
{"text":"Since moving to Mesa, Beaver Choice has expanded their menu as well as their restaurant space. Despite the change in location, they still serve up the same high quality, perfectly cooked meals.

After being seated and looking through the menu, I decided on a dish that they didn't offer at their old location: Frikadeller (Danish meatballs). I also tried some of their chicken schnitzel. The meatballs were perfectly cooked, with great texture and flavor. The sauce was sweet and tangy which I enjoyed at first, but became too sweet for my palate towards the end of my meal. Overall, I still enjoyed it though. The schnitzel was, as always, excellent. It was a nice balance of crispy breading, tender meat, perfectly seasoned.

Service was good, and I'm glad to see some of the members of the family are still there at the restaurant helping out."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, and did not get what I was hoping for.  Service was very slow, they were out of what I ordered, and the prices were VERY high.  Food was just OK, nothing to rave about.  Very odd place."}
{"text":"Very good, I had the Viking Schnitzel which was awesome and my date had the Swedish Meatballs which I also tried and were delicious. my first Scandinavian experience and definitely will not be my last!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant.  I wish it was more marketed or in a better location because this place is so good it should draw huge crowds!

It does take a while to get your food.  Why?  Because they hand make everything to order!  No getting food that's been under a warmer for a few hours, its fresh fresh fresh!  What else do they offer?  A nice small clean ambiance with nice glass tables, an incredibly friendly staff, and games to play while you wait.

They do not serve alcoholic.  But that doesn't matter because you can bring your own wine and beer.  That's right, you don't even have to pay exorbitant liquor prices!

All in all, its a fantastic place.  Totally worth the wait.  I love the pork schnitzel cordon bleu on the baguette and the poutine.    I think they key in that order when I walk in I get it so often.  Try it, you'll see.  Just absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  Schnitzel is amazing, as well as the poutine. Yesterday's visit was my first since they moved. It's gorgeous. I especially like that everything is made to order. As such be prepared to wait a bit its is so worth it.  Have drinks with your friends and family while you wait."}
{"text":"I loved everything I had. Schnitzel, Rosti, Tomato basil salad. My wife had the Swedish meatballs which were great and my daughter had the chicken with cardamom sauce and the green beans were garlicy and light.  Every item was great. We shared a poutine which fantastic.  We will eat the desserts later."}
{"text":"I was getting an eye check up and as I am wont to do I spin the lucky wheel of Yelp (e.g. restaurants nearby) and oh my stars and garters, up comes a Scandinavian Restaurant with just great reviews! Scandinavian, I thought, in the desert? It's a 105 degrees outside and people in Scandinavia grow up near glaciers! Then the name of the place, wow! As someone else noted, it doesn't make think of food, that is for sure! However, who knows, maybe beavers are a symbol of quality when you grow up near the glaciers.

In the interest of all things foodie I headed over and entered and as others have noted, some of the friendliest people you will ever meet, you immediately feel like you are some long lost relative finally stopping by and they are so happy to see you. I told them I had discovered them on Yelp and they were thrilled. Since my eyes were completely dilated (from the eye doctor visit) I couldn't read the menu and took the advice of the mother of the family and ordered the Schnitzel cordon-blue, along with mashed potatoes, pickled green beans, basil and tomato salad and sauerkraut. I could hear them pounding the chicken for the Schnitzel and I kid you not, one of the cooks (one of the two brothers) said that was how you knew they put love into the food they made, it was all done fresh. 

Well, it was really good. The Schnitzel was huge, the mushroom gravy was well, really mushroomy in a good way. I loved the pickled cabbage and the tomato basil salad was awesome! The pickled green beans were good but could be a bit more tangy.

Oh, they also brought out the tasting menu everyone talks about. The Gravlax (2 day cured salmon) was really good with the mustard dipping sauce, the Swedish potato salad was wonderfully creamy and if you like capers, they put that in there as well. I also enjoyed the beet salad (they pickle the beets themselves because...they couldn't find any good enough, how cool is that?).

So, a delightful foody treat, one that I would never expect to find out in the desert land of Phoenix so you thank those nice people for leaving their glaciers and coming all the way out here to make such good and unique food for the people of Phoenix.  Next trip there, the double burgers with Swedish-style anchovies and mustard, wowza! :-)"}
{"text":"Wait- I thought that I'd already reviewed them? Maybe not, but anyways...

This place is not only fantastic, it's completely unique. You're just not going to find food or service like this anywhere nearby. We stopped here for lunch and enjoyed two different schnitzel dishes. Not only that, but the people who work here are *REALLY* friendly. The young man who took our orders brought our coffee out, and he was obviously really proud of it. The coffee was excellent, and I told him so, and beaming with pride he told me how he made it and how he liked to take his time making the coffee properly. It was a small little touch, but it went a long way.

The selections on their menu will make you want to come back and try something completely different next time. I know we will!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had Scandinavian food before but I will definitely have it again!  Wonderful restaurant, great food made from scratch and the owner is such a joy to be around.   I had the Swedish Meatball entree and you get 4 sides. I had the tomato basil, marinated green beans, Swedish coleslaw and the \"smashed potato\" which is like a bake potato that has been slightly mashed and covered in leeks.   Utterly fantastic!   Not sure what the meatballs had as a spice in them but I devoured them!  And the gravy was good enough to suck through a straw!   They gave us free samples of the pierogies and by far the best I e ever had!  Definitely going to try the Thursday night special if all you can eat pierogies, soup and salad!!!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience.  Was there on 2/17/18. First time there. 
Atmosphere is plain.  Most tables were empty but they couldn't seem to find enough menus. We watched as they gave people who came in after us menus but felt kind of isolated waiting for ours. 

A few minutes after they brought our menus, they brought water and we let them know that we were ready to order. They said \"your server will be by soon\" she wasn't.   

The server that came to take our order was very nice. She was helpful and we got our order in.

Then nothing really happened for quite a long time. We watched as orders were taking two other customers who had come in after we were seated. Finally, the two children's items For our family came. They said that the rest of our orders would be there soon.

We nibbled on the kids pasta and hotdogs for about 30 minutes. Finally about an hour and 10 minutes after we came into the restaurant, two more orders arrived. A cheeseburger that are teenager described as \"OK\" and a \"Schumaker\" which was bland and unimpressive.

They told us that my order which was their signature dish a schnitzel Cordon Bleu had been burned and that they were remaking it. Unfortunately for them we watched several of the same orders, a schnitzel Cordon Bleu passed to other customers. I find it hard to believe that their signature order takes an hour and a half to prepare.

Finally, my order arrived. It was all right. Nothing impressive or unexpected. We definitely won't be back. The people were nice but the food was bland and took forever to arrive at our table. If You care about your time, if you care about eating even close to healthy food, if you care about some sort of spice with your dish, you're probably not like it here. We won't be back. Even the kids were unimpressed with the hotdog and pasta. And quite frankly they are easily impressed."}
{"text":"Had been looking forward to this but disappointed.  Herring plate and vegetarian scallops were very good. Cordon Blue Schnitzel was so so ...cabbage rolls pretty bad.  Desserts were great.  Service slow but not the servers fault.  Doubt we will come back."}
{"text":"Everything was great here. If you're missing northern European fare, you'll hit the jackpot with this place. They have pirogies! Ohhh...sweet pirogies.
Everything was amazing and I don't mind the long wait because the food is totally worth it, if you can't call in your order before hand. The staff and owner are very interesting to talk to and love what they do. I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan! 

I brought my boyfriend here unknowingly, and he had his doubts about the place, but I knew he would be eating his words later. The restaurant is a lot smaller than I expected, with 8 or so tables in the front, over half of which were occupied when we arrived. Some people were ordering in front of us, so we grabbed some menus and decided on what to get. When it was our turn, who I'm assuming is the son of the family took our orders. I had the chicken schnitzel, broccoli, green bean salad, coleslaw, and pan-fried thyme potatoes. My bf had the stuffed chicken breast, coleslaw, dill mashed potatoes, and I forgot what else :)

Never having schnitzel, I was a little nervous, but it was SO GOOD. The mushroom sauce it came with was also delicious. It's pretty moderately priced (our plates were about $11/each), but you get so much food, I wasn't able to finish it all. As others have said, everything is made to order so it takes a little while to get your plates, but I would say it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! It's a new favorite in my family and we've started a tradition of having a family feast at Beaver Choice every time I'm in town to visit. The food is incredible and they're kind enough to accommodate our parties of 10+, even when we've had a few Lobster Lover's and have gotten a little... loud lol. 

Hannah is great- totally charming, warm and welcoming and her presence really creates a great \"family\" feeling of sorts. 

The food is delicious! So far I've tried the Elk Stew (my all time favorite), the Viking Schnitzel, the Hunter's Stew, deep fried perogies, cabbage rolls, and the Swedish meatballs. All of these are great, all 5/5. Everyone we have taken here has been impressed with their meal. Big portions, so bring your appetite. I always look forward to coming back for more. How I wish I was there now!

Also, with a name like that..."}
{"text":"OMG, call me FULL of schnitzel!   I feel like Beaver Choice is kinda hidden in a strip mall, and only a few (yelpers and Scandinavians) actually know about the restaurant.  And that's ok with me.  A small mom and pop's restaurant is definitely a popular place where people can dine, discuss the day's happenings and even play games while waiting for their lunch or dinner.  OH, and you can bring your own wine!  

I had the pork schnitzel with a mushroom cream sauce, dill mashed potatoes, green beans, steam broccoli and tomato basil salad.  Nothing was left on my plate.  We also had the fries with the cheese curds and gravy and malt vinegar.  

But wait, you must have some dessert! I had the chocolate brownie pie with fresh cream and strawberries , and I ended up taking some of the cookies and these balls made of chocolate, coconut, oatmeal called beaver balls home.

Friendly family staff, loved the fact that if there was an argument between family members in the dining area, it was in Swedish or German ..not sure which.  It just added to the charm.

Will be back for the Swedish meatballs!"}
{"text":"We came here a while ago after I have read several reviews raving about this place. I knew about the food is a little pricey, and I knew the wait would be longer than other restaurants. So we brought our phones to kill time.  When we got there, there were quite a few customers already. The place was over 2/3 full.  But we were seated right away and served our water.  Our waiter came to talk to us and let us know there was going to be a 40 minutes wait for food from the time we placed the order. It's ok, we said, we were prepared. We told the waiter my hubby needed to have gluten free dishes, so he suggested a few things that would be GF. So after ordering hubby and I chatted and played on our phones. It was long, especially when hungry. But we are very looking forward to try the new flavors, we did not mind. I remember I ordered Swedish meatballs and potato pancake, and cole slaw. My hubby had a meat dish (sorry it's been too long and I could not recall.) When we were served at first I thought the portion was small for both. Then we both dug in and tried it. Oh it was so good and so filling. My hubby stuffed himself with his dinner and I took a little leftover box home. And the leftover smelled and tasted just as great as the dinner; after I heated it up at home, I did not smell that typical restaurant grease smell at all. I believe they were telling the truth when they said all the dishes were preped fresh!"}
{"text":"Wow! Such great food and service! We ordered the Viking Schnitzel- very crispy and flavorful. The rhubarb cake for dessert was exceptional. The owner served us and was so sweet- offering us tastes of Polish ingredients and offering humorous commentary. We'll definitely come back and bring friends."}
{"text":"We came from AZ from Las Vegas on a vacation and didn't know where to eat, so I looked on Yelp and figured why not give this place a try. We love to try new food and it said it was a family owned and run business and I am all for supporting those. It was amazing. Great food, a lot of it, the kids loved it even though they were not sure about it at first. When we went to order dessert to go, the owner came out and told my Mom who wanted the dessert, that it would not be good if she sent her home with it because it is a Rhubarb crumble and the crumbles would get soggy, so she would rather not sell it than sell it and have my mom disappointed in it. We ended up staying a little longer so my Mom could have her dessert and was she ever glad she did. I would def. go back here the next time we are in town. What place tells you they would rather you be happy than make money. 2 thumbs up and 5 stars for sure :)"}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best food in town of its kind! I've tried several German restaurants and never come across such amazing schnitzel. The quality of food, side dishes, and garnishing all have infused flavors. I didn't have high hopes walking into this place, but I must say, this restaurant left me very impressed! I'm definitely going to keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with some of the other reviewers on here, about how it seems to be going downhill.
On Thursday \"all you can eat\" perogie  night, it seems like a chore to get them to keep fresh perogies in the steam table.  And they only have like 3 different flavors...one steamed and one pan fried.  And the flavors don't differ much.
-Potato and cheese
-potato cheese w.jalapeno
-Farmer potato
-oh yeah, and some mushroom one.  nasty.

The only bright side is the schnitzel is really good.  The only reason I came back a second time was I love the Honey beer from Poland.
But the last time I was there, the nice server found out where they get if from locally, so now I can go get some!

If they decide to make the all u can eat, actually worth eating..i will be back.
otherwise...I wont choose beaver choice."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding! Make sure you save room for dessert. They have a cash policy which makes it confusing when you see your bill because it makes you think that you may be paying a lower price, but if you're using a credit card it is slightly higher, and they take care of that difference when you pay your bill, it is also clearly noted on the menu. Tonight they had a large party of eight reserve the table near mine, and they had three children that brought in food from an outside restaurant. The hostess told the party (the adults) they would not be served because of this, and they were invited to leave. It was an interesting policy to observe. On my way out the party was standing outside and we briefly talked about it, and they said that they had done this before and were wondering why it wasn't acceptable this time and that they were puzzled. Aside from this situation, everything was quite acceptable here. The physical restaurant space needs a little bit of attention to detail, but other than that everything seems very clean and presentable.  I highly recommend that you try this restaurant, even with any quirks that it might have its still worth your time and energy to visit and enjoy."}
{"text":"It's Swedish. That's why it's called Beaver Choice, that's why it's got a friendly Beaver painted on the window, and that's why you have board games to play \"while you wait for your food\".

The people running the restaurant couldn't be nicer nor more helpful in explaining the menu - they really love being there and it shines through everywhere. Their schnitzel is legitimate and delicious. Order off the (more) Swedish menu and take their advice."}
{"text":"Beaver Choice is definitely one of the more unique spots in Tempe. I think they are moving to Mesa which is sad, but I'm sure it is attributed to their success. When I asked the owners what percentage of their business comes from Yelp, they said 95%. Holy crap.

When we walked in, we were greeted by the mom, dad, and son. I love that. After discussing the restaurant with them and the all the options we have, we put in our orders and took a seat. They warned us that the food will take a while to come out, but that was okay. They had board games in the dining room and it was fun to just chit chat about the food that we couldn't pronounce but just ordered. The family is very friendly and passionate about their business. I've never spent so much time talking to the owners of a restaurant before receiving my food.

45 minutes later (yeah.... really long time), we got our food and it was soooo good. Swedish meatballs were like nothing I've ever imagined, pork schnitzel was spot on, and I even tried poutine for the first time! We had a few other things, but I seriously couldn't pronounce them so I'm not even going to bother trying to recall and spell them--just trust me that it was to die for. Scandinavian food is very rich and complex--not something I expected before I visited here.

I'm excited to visit the new location. Normally I would be worried for a business if they made this type of a move, but honestly their Tempe location wasn't anything to shout about. It was a very odd spot and restaurant was kind of hard to find the first time."}
{"text":"Great place if you love European food , portions are huge and our schnitzels were delicious. They had great selection of imported beers. Definitely will be back for more , their menu has a lot of to choose from!"}
{"text":"While driving down Baseline several months ago, I saw a sign for a restaurant called Beaver Choice. I thought, \"What the heck is that?\" The intriguing name led to research on the Internet that revealed this is a Scandinavian, Polish, Swedish, and Canadian restaurant. Based on reviews by other Yelpers, I decided the next time I was in the neighborhood to stop in and try their fair.

After enjoying the Shoemaker's Box followed up with Polish custard, I thought, \"Why did I wait so long to try this restaurant?\" Big kudos to Hannah and the staff at Beaver Choice. What a phenomenal find. Everything on the menu is outstanding and were it not for the fact that I would weigh over 800 pounds if I ate there regularly they couldn't pry me out of the place."}
{"text":"Food here is really good, but beware, often times food on the menu is not available. And when they say they close at 9, it means they stop offering food and start cleaning up at 8:30 and they ask you to leave at 8:50. 

*edit:
Lol... 

They \"can't\" split a bill, and the owners got into a fight with an employee and fired him in the middle of the floor... you can get better service and just as good pirogies else where..."}
{"text":"My husband found this place on Google. We were celebrating our friend's birthday! The food was fantastic! And for dessert, get the Beaver's Supreme! The owner was awesome! Can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Top quality food that is very unique to the area. The desserts are amazing"}
{"text":"Try their Elk stew. Super rich but the flavors are well balanced.  Their pierogi's are wonderfully crispy and delicious. The schnitzel was tender and fried well. Even their wedge French fries were crunchy and fried perfectly and I don't normally like wedge French fries.  Well done and worth the trip."}
{"text":"This is a small, quirky, family-run restaurant.   Maybe we went at a bad day, but they had real problems.

Service was way slow and confusing.   Other reviewers say this, and this does not rate 2 stars.     We got an appetizer plate that came with two small crackers, I asked for a couple more crackers it took like 10 minutes no kidding.    Bottom line is that they are stretched thin and very disorganized.  

A couple of the dishes were terrible.  We got a three kinds of baked casseroles (you have to order in advance).   One was some kind of tomato cream dish way too sweet and salty.  The other was some kind of potato fish bake, greasy, again way salty, and had bad fish smell.  Keep in mind that I like sardines, anchovies etc and that I like salty food.

We had a large party and asked for a few extra plates, were told there was usually a 4 dollar \"plate fee\" to cover dish washing cost.  Huh?

Atmosphere:  I usually don't care about atmosphere and I realize they had to rent a strip mall place, but too loud.   The eating area is small and has hard surfaces, and they had a boom box playing pop music.   Basically everyone had to talk louder, which echoed, which made everyone talk louder.    

We did get a few good items and I wish them the best of luck.   My advice to owners:

Simplify your menu, figure out popular dishes that you do well and cut out most of the rest, then try to organize your operation.   The biggest problem with small restaurants is sometimes trying to do too much.

Secondly cut the boom box.   Don't copy the worst of chain restaurants by providing \"free\" music, at least until you get better acoustics.

I don't own restaurant and if I did it would certainly fail, so take my advice for what it is worth.   This restaurant will be moving to new, larger location and if they don't prepare the problems could get much much worse.   Current staff and organization with bigger place would be disaster.

Good luck, would like to come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Loved the atmosphere.  Wonderful night out.  Excellent European beer choices too.  Looking forward yo the next visit.  Hannah's enthusiasm & hugs make it a perfect place."}
{"text":"I took my wife and mother out to dinner here. If you are craving european food this place will fill up that desire. The service was pretty good and we tried the huge macaroon desert. My only gripe was the restaurant was a tad on the pricey side The cost wouldnt deter me from going back but definitely more of a special occasion price point."}
{"text":"Surprisingly cozy and modern atmosphere. The crab cake appetizer was delicious.  Swedish meatballs were good but a little too sweet for my palette.  Expect a lengthy dining experience and set aside a couple hours as the dishes take a while and service was not the most speedy (though the service was friendly!). Make reservations if you can!"}
{"text":"Service was a little shady but food was really good.Absolutely fresh ingredients made to order. Their specialty desert is something to try."}
{"text":"Really disappointed.  I was very excited to come here and was ignored for twenty minutes before I walked out.  We even had a conversation with the owner who i had met before at a foodie event about how I was waiting for a menu and some water.  She went into the back for a couple of minutes... then came out to serve someone else.  I must not have looked very friendly at that point."}
{"text":"My daughter has been bragging about this restaurant and I did not know what to expect. I have never had anything on this menu so I ordered the cordon bleu which was reccommended to me by my daughter. I was very pleasantly surprised. The chicken was moist, very flavorful, and really different from anything I have ever had in a good way! The sides are plentiful and they have some really great selections. My favorite sides were the coleslaw, dill potato salad, and saurkraut. Service was good, the place wasn't very busy though at lunch. Food came out quickly and was nice and hot. 

The server kept our drink refilled and was very friendly. This is going to be a new favorite of mine I can see!"}
{"text":"I've traveled all across the United States by car, and stayed in lots of places.  One of the more interesting aspect of road travel in the USA Is noting how immigration in the past affected the culture of different parts of the country.  There are enclaves of just about every group from across the planet somewhere in the United States.  I've eaten Czech food in North Dakota, Polish food in Wisconsin, and my fair share of Scandinavian food in Minnesota. I've heard plenty of \"Uffdah's\" and \"Ainna's\" in the same places, and dabbled in the occasional jaunt north of the border to find same.

So to find a restaurant in Mesa, Arizona featuring this cuisine... And doing it well... That was a little surprising even for me.

On one of our road trips, we had heard about this place from a gas station attendant.  Pretty sure he was just being funny, but we called his bluff, and drove over here for dinner.  Always down to try new things, I guess we just weren't feeling another round of subway or fast food burgers on the road.

All I can say is, it was pretty cool.  There's this strange feeling like you're eating in somebody's home, even though it's clearly a strip mall/business park style restaurant.  

While having a Lithuanian grandmother, as I did, is not quite the same thing... There are several parallels between that culinary experience growing up, and eating here.  For one thing, the sample platters and sides, if you will, are already too much food on the table. Yes, just like Nana used to over feed you.  Coleslaw, and beet salad, and a house salad, and broccoli, and that's to say nothing of the meatballs and other meat dishes like hash and gravlax-- I love salmon.

For the main courses, we ordered a Lazanki, a chicken, and a burger... and sort of split and shared.  Already full from the beet salad.  Did I mention I had a Lithuanian grandma?  Sausage and onion and sauerkraut and cheese... As a salt and vinegar junkie, this was my happy place.  I considered asking for a big tall glass of buttermilk just really to round out my childhood experience with Nana, but considering I was already busting at the seams, decided against it.

My only regret, is that we did not save room for dessert. We just couldn't do it. The server and the menu shared information about several interesting options, but we were full.

I gotta thank that gas station attendant for pushing Beaver Choice on us. Candidly, we probably never would've come in here or sought the place out.  But hey-- nothing ventured, nothing gained. Alas, I think I gained 8 pounds... But you can learn more about that in one of my future gym reviews."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic menu, variety and service. The Polish Sampler was magnificent. Highly recommended. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this little hidden gem! Owner was very sweet and personal with helping us order. We had a large group of 8 and they took good care of us. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I really like the deserts however beware of the automatic service fee If you have 6 people or more.   We questioned the server if it was in lieu of an additional tip and he stated he only gets a small portion and an additional tip would be appreciated. Kinda shady I thought and I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has home cooked  meals, original polish and Scandinavian kitchen.  They also offer great choice of polish beer. 
We had pierogi with meat, home made potato dumplings -one of the best I ever had -  and gravlax, which tasted absolutely awesome.  I also orderd delicious sage chicken. 
 We met owners and we had long conversation with them, they are super nice and very helpful. Our waiter was also on top of it.  We also bought 3 dozen of frozen pierogi to go which I will make for dinner one day. 
If you want experience original European kitchen, home made food and nice atmosphere this is the place to go. Do not expect bill to be brought to your table after you done with eating,  its european place and they will not bring it to you unless you ask for it.  In Europe dining out it is a celebration, a social event which can take up to 3 hours :-),  they want you to  feel welcome and don't rushed off the table after you done.  So please take your time, relax, have a dessert and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pierogis! I want to move in and eat here every meal. This place is amazing and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"\"It's not a party until the perogies come out.\"

I agree, and on Thursday nights, it's all you can eat perogies here at Beaver Choice.  For one small price, you can scoop up as many pan fried and steamed perogies as you can eat.

Of course, you're not limited to the perogi feast.  They also have their regular menu--a selection of Scandanavian, Polish, and Canadian dishes, with a sprinkling of other tastes as well.  Everything is very fresh!  I recommend the schnitzel.

You don't see food like this very often.  Rest assured, when you have it here, it will be of the highest quality and served up by an ultra-friendly staff.  The owner loves what she does, and it really shows.  My wife and I are glad that we decided to start coming here.  Beaver Choice is the right choice when we are looking for a taste that's just a little different, and yet very delicious.  I think you'll agree."}
{"text":"Three words...REAL HOME COOKING! This is a small hole in the wall run by a family. Came here tonight based on their yelp reviews & am not let down:)!!

If you don't have time to relax & wait for your food, don't come here just yet. They will be moving to a larger location in Feb 2013."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally got to check it out during Restaurant Week. Could not be more disappointed from the build up to the place to the actual food & prices, and the fact that the waitress seemed to take pride in telling us we could not have what we were asking for. We ordered off the restaurant week menu and I wish we had just tried the regular menu because it would have been much cheaper and we could have had a little more control over what we got. For example, each dish comes with a starch & 3 salads. For restaurant week, you could not choose the sides so I ended up with tomatoes with basil & a side of pickles. Pickles. 2 sides, not 3- one of which was pickles. But I'm getting ahead of myself. For appetizers, we got a lobster roll & poutine, which is French fries topped with cheese curds and gravy. The fries were freaking epic. The lobster roll was a hot dog bun filled with dill and a few fishy little langostinos. Entrees: schnitzel, a large, uneventful cutlet of sorts with various pickled veggies and copious amounts of dill, and some crazy potatoes that looked good but tasted like the inside of a pool supply store. I got something described as sliced meat over potatoes. Apparently this is Scandinavian for hockey puck on hospital cafeteria potatoes. Keep salting, you will not find the flavor. It is not there. Perhaps that's why they threw a pile of pickles next to it. I'll never know. I'll also never know where the bread is. I asked for some. Saw a lady with a slice. But the waitress, remember the one I mentioned earlier, who seems to take pride in not being the least bit accommodating, let us know that bread was only for people who ordered soup. Oh and the $8 kids meal! Can't forget the 1/2 cup of noodles covered in some kind of sauce that no child would ever touch. Supposed to come with a starch and a side but guess what- that doesn't apply to the pasta dish- so no French fries for the 6 year old but here- have some god damned pickled beets rolled in more dill. Every kids dream.  And now ladies and gents,  get out your bowl molds and jello no bake cheesecake, cause its time for some premade generic, gummy cool whip based concoction topped with jello. Jello.  We got cheesecake and something called lemon fluff. They were identical. Bowl mold shaped blobs of that foamy jello mixed with cool whip that you find at hillbilly bbqs. The only difference was that one tasted a bit more lemony & the other was topped with actual jello.
Honestly, the more I reflect on our meal, the more angry I become. I don't know why anybody likes this place and I wanna punch the waitress in her neck tattoo. You wanna eat what i ate? Save the $100 and go to the cafeteria of your local nursing home."}
{"text":"Even if the decor is from Ikea the food is anything but Ikea. Really eclectic mix of scandavian, polish and canadian food. Desserts are wonderful. Huge portions and dirt cheap prices. Shhh, don't tell them they can easily charge more. If they were in a real sit down restaurant and not a strip mall fast food locale they could charge twice as much and still be considered cheap.  All food is handmade and should remind you of what Grandma used to make for you from the old country."}
{"text":"The family makes the best food and provides such a good atmosphere! Definitely try the Beaver Supreme for dessert."}
{"text":"Excellent food, something different than all other options in the valley. All you can eat pierogi was awesome!"}
{"text":"My first foray into Scandinavian food and Beaver's Choice 

They recently moved and after a 4 month wait they reopened to a newly remodeled place. The new place looks pretty great, I never visited the old location beyond peering at it from the outside but this place is a clear upgrade based on the aesthetics alone. 

Food:

The poutine was ok, not amazing but decent. Wish they used better fries. (Hand cut would be better)

I had the Laxpudding and friend had the Kottbuller (Swedish Meatballs). 
If your not a fan of dill and sour notes you might find the food here agreeable to your palate but it was nice contrast to my usual eatings.

The best part of the food here in my opinion was the three sides that accompany your meal. I had pickled beets, broccoli, and the house cole slaw. Get the beets! The beets are good.

Foods on the pricey side but finding Swedish food is hard in Arizona beyond an Ikea.
Also talking with the fam as we waited for our takeout was great fun. 

I'm guessing the poor reviews on service below can be attributed to people coming in during peak hours because my experience was quite different. (Also they make everything to order and look like their still adjusting to the size of their new restaurant from our conversation)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and the food was incredibly tasty! Portions are very large. I got the pork schnitzel and it came with two huge pork cutlets breaded and cooked to perfection and covered with this really good mushroom gravy. The Swedish potato salad was so good, and I don't even care for potato salad. The owners are incredible friendly too. I can't wait to go back here again."}
{"text":"Just had another fantastic meal at Beaver Choice!!  We made ourselves order different items than the last two times--so difficult since our favorites are sooo good!  Between us, we enjoyed Swedish meatballs, Schnitzels, pierogies, and many side dishes and salads including the best creamy dill potatoes I've ever tasted. The side salad selection is plentiful and each is delicious!  We had two desserts--blueberry crepes and the Beaver tower--amazing.

Somehow,even better than the food are the people--welcoming and so accommodating.  I would also say it would be impossible to find a cleaner restaurant around.  Go to enjoy a leisurely dinner, company and a fantastic beer list!

We look forward to many more dinners at this wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"I came here with two of my Native Polish friends and it was the best decision of 2017. They have the best pierogi's in the metro! I couldn't help to eat until I was stuffed, then I kept eating! The owner was so friendly! Great prices and even better service!"}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Beaver Choice since their first location and have been driving the 25 miles to eat there for years.  Unfortunately, this past week, I made the mistake of going there for the all you can eat pierogi night.  The pierogi were totally dried out, shriveled and cold.  The people I brought with me were so disappointed and wondered how I raved about this place for so long.  I was very embarrassed.  It is a good deal at only $11.95 for unlimited pierogis (4 flavors), soup and a simple salad, but when you can't eat them, it is worthless.  If they want to continue this special, they really need to prepare the pierogis fresh to order.  We ended up doing that at the end, since they ran out on the buffet, and what a difference it was.  I wish they would have told us that we could have done that from the beginning.  Pierogis just can't sit long in a warmer and be edible.  I had my favorite schnitzel and 3 salads and 1 potato, which were all excellent, as always, but the potatoes were cold.  I sent them back and they were going to get me hot ones, but they never came back until I was finished eating.  At this point, I asked to box them up and take them home.  Service was very slow that night, and it wasn't even busy.  All in all, I would still go back as their food is good quality and all made from scratch, but I certainly wouldn't return for the all you can eat pierogi night, unless they started making them to order."}
{"text":"Incredibly amiable owners, unique menu selection made fresh by experienced cook. Went in hungry and (after being kindly offered a sampling of all delicious side options) left completely satisfied with a full plate sticking to my ribs: pork cordon-bleu, mashed potatoes, creamy beet salad, sweet green beans, just-right sauerkraut and some lovely gravy (see picture)."}
{"text":"I came here for Restaurant Week to try their food. The food was great, but the service was terrible. I had three people in my party and our appetizers were all brought out at different times. 

Our entrees also arrived at different times. My friend ordered the salmon and it was cooked to rare at best. I had the cordon bleu schnitzel, which was absolutely delicious. However, it took the waitress about 10 minutes to clear our plates. 

We waited for our desserts for about a half hour until we saw the waitress grab the pre prepared desserts out of a dessert cabinet. I cannot understand why it took a half hour to grab something that we were staring at the whole time. 

The waitress was very inattentive the whole time, despite the fact that the restaurant wasn't even half full. I will not be returning to this establishment, unfortunately. I really enjoyed the food, but there is no excuse for such poor service."}
{"text":"6 of us showed up to try poutine for the first time(well, just 4 of us never tried it). We came at 9:32pm on a Friday night. The staff greeted us-and we told them 6 people in total. The server checked with the owner and stated that the only way they will serve us is if we order carry out because they already turned off the gas at 9:30. If you're supposedly open until 10pm-HONOR IT and let people eat/drink/etc and bring you business. Probably never going back to that establishment and they probably don't care."}
{"text":"For $16 per plate, I expect real mashed potatoes. This place used instant mashed potatoes, canned mushrooms, and ham labeled as \"pork belly\". I was really excited to eat here because of all the good reviews but I was very disappointed in my $50 lunch for 2."}
{"text":"Good, hearty food! Warm customer service! Bottomless iced green tea! And you gotta try the Werewolf.

We were greeted with two free sample pierogies and they were delicious! I think they definitely want you to order them because the profit margin must be ridiculously high since they're so expensive to eat in. It would be cheaper to get a dozen of them frozen and take them home so that's what we planned on doing.

For our stay though we tried the blue cheese stuffed mushrooms, a small poutine, and the swedish sampler plate. Everything was good!! But our favorite was the salmon, and of course the delicious dill sauce for it. 

The biggest downside is that their prices are entirely too steep really for what you get. Also, they really emphasize their pierogies but don't have every flavor all the time? I really wanted to take home a dozen of the cheesecake ones since they got such rave reviews on yep but was told they didn't have any that day and that their types rotate. What a major let down! For that being their only dessert flavor, it really should not be in a rotation.

I wouldn't go again, but they definitely earned at least 4 stars."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best food in the valley. Even if you're not familiar with Scandinavian cuisine the staff is extremely helpful/friendly and there are a wealth of more traditional options.

The food is fresh, carefully prepared, absolutely delicious and served up with great sides. 

My favorite? The surf and turf hamburger (one of the only hamburgers I've never felt the need to put catchup on btw), served with the (included) couscous side, steamed broccoli, green peas, and green beans.  

Like all good food, it takes time to prepare. While this isn't the ideal place if you're in a rush, if you enjoy friendly people and good food made with loving care - this is definitely a must visit.  Hands down one of Tempe's hidden gems."}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite restaurant.  Everything is good, but what I truly appreciated was a homemade cheese dessert yumm.  Family owned restaurant and some of the nicest owners I have ever met.  They make you feel so welcome.  Totally unique place to eat in the valley."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place a better review. We went here for our wedding anniversary. I've been dying to try it for some time now.

I want to start out by saying that the food is exceptional. The place was clean and orderly, and the prices were reasonable. 

I wish I could end the review right here, but alas, that is not the case. 

After opening the doors late, we were seated and asked what we wanted to drink. It took about 20 minutes for them to come to the table and drop off a pitcher of iced tea. I don't mind pouring myself, but just a pitcher of iced tea and a pitcher of water, seems kind of hinkey. 

Next, we ordered the Perogie app, and we were told that it was better to order the app from the buffet, because you get two more, reluctantly we did this. The issue is, they didn't bother to explain how the buffet works, they didn't both to tell us where to get plates, and they didn't bother to tell us that the buffet only had 3 kinds, unlike the menu. 

I asked the waiter his advice, because I was torn between the authentic Scandinavian dish of pickled herring or the more traditional hunters stew. In a shocking moment, he told us that the pickled herring was nasty and \"ethnic\". Yeah, I'm not sure what that means either. 

Again, the food was exceptional, so no complaints there, but service was super slow and the place was not full.... they have a weird policy of charging less for food if you pay in cash, each dish has two prices next to it, one for cash customers and one for credit customers. It's freakin' 2018, are we really being penalized for using our debit cards? WHY? 

To make matters worse, I ordered a take out portion of stew. The waiter, and I use this title loosely, dropped off the container, and much to my surprise it was only a salad. Was this a subtle hint that my fata$$ should go to the gym? I'm not sure... but after asking, twice, I did receive my food. Finally, the nice old lady came to our table with her tablet and we paid right at the table. No biggie, except she told us 3x that she was looking for new waitstaff because \"these people are lazy and refuse to clean\".... Ummmm we just ate here! 

It just wasn't a great experience, at all."}
{"text":"The family here really made me feel at home. They also did a great job of making me feel like a valued guest. I had the pork schnitzel cordon bleu. It was awesome, I pretty much ate every morsel that was served."}
{"text":"I love this place like crazy wild good times. It's not open on Mondays and that makes me sad. For some reason I always want to front-load my week with some Beaver Choice. But the fact that they have the only authentic Scandinavian food for miles (suck it, IKEA!) makes up for this common small biz quirk. Plus it's owned by some of the hardest working, nicest folks in the business. Real Swedes making real Swedish food that will bend over backwards to make sure you're satisfied with your experience.

Get the gravlax. The lady in charge buys only the best and cures it by hand, and for the price there's no better lox in town. Get the schnitzel. Get the lunch wraps for super cheap. Just get your ass there. It's freakin' fantastic and you will not regret the decision. 

Be forewarned that this place is a walk-up, order-at-the-counter type joint. It's not full service so you won't be bothered every two seconds to see if \"everything's okay\" when you have a mouthful of Swedish meat-a-balls. You might have to get up and, like, walk back to the counter if you want a refill of something. Oh the horror.

In parting, do it. Do it fast. Do it furious. And do it with great frequency.

Beaver Choice!!"}
{"text":"Very eclectic menu. Party of six, for husband's birthday, with some picky eaters who typically aren't very adventurous. Everyone pushed their culinary envelopes, and everyone was happy that they did. The pirogies were the best that I have had since my husband's grandmother died. Service was excellent, and entire staff was very friendly and efficient. Great food."}
{"text":"Totally unpretentious, small, very casual, interestingly-named, family-operated, and offering good values on large portions of delicious food. 

Thus: A keeper!

Two things to note before you go: There are only 6 4-top tables so reservations are recommended. Also, no liquor license, so it's BYOB with a $5-per-bottle corking fee. The side-salad options on the menu are kinda confusing at first. Keep in mind that they don't combine the separate items in a bowl: You are essentially ordering three separate small side dishes served on the same plate as the main course. 

Business is good enough that they're talking about expanding to a larger location, which would be nice. I hope they can keep the same qualities that make their place a must-visit today."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and so was the service.  My wife and I wanted to try something different and this place had good reviews.  Portions are huge! And there is something for anyone.  Highly recommend this authentic, home cooked food, especially for something unique or different."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night with wife.  Food was great, but be forewarned...they don't prep anything in advance so it takes a long time for food to arrive.  For an app we got a crab cake.  Very small but it had caviar on top.  For the main courses I had the schnitzel Parmagan and my wife got the sampler.  She said it was the best meal she has had in ages.  The server was great.  Can't fault her for the cook being slow.  For dessert, we had the Beaver Supreme.  Neither of us have ever had anything like it.

Overall, we enjoyed it and would be back.  I'm giving it 4 Stars since the decor could be better and cook was slow."}
{"text":"Fantastic change of pace. I loved their Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes and their Pork Schnitzel is also amazing. All dinners come with a multitude of delicious sides. Unfortunately, the atmosphere here is about as romantic as a K-mart -- Luckily they are moving to a new bigger and better spot on Baseline soon (hopefully without the florescent lighting). Bonus: The new spot with also have a bar - the owner showed me the plans."}

{"text":"My friend and I went for dinner and freaking loved it!!!  The food was so tasty!  We got the sampler and the \"vegetarian scallops\" and there was so much great food.  I love this place and will certainly be going back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The absolute best staff you could ask for. Great traditional drink menu. Extensive menu that is traditional Scandanavian at its finest. Very large portions was nice to try each other's food. The food was fantastic. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic and they are creating a food truck. There's not a lot of traffic here so be sure to stop in and help their business to keep the good food coming. You really must stop in to try the pierogies and the schnitzels. They have a selection of Scandinavian and European beers and dishes. This restaurant is run like a family business so if they are slow it's because they are understaffed at the time but they are always friendly. Last time I went with three other people we all swore we would be back to try all the other dishes. So far I like The Cordon Bleu schnitzel and the elk stew."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for some time . . . so when a client of mine from Germany suggested this place . . . I jumped at the chance.

The interior was clean with a variety of seating options from high tops to tables to booths . . . we chose a table.  The waitress came quickly and took our drink order while we looked at the menus.  I decided on the Swedish Hash with sauerkraut, marinated green beans, and coleslaw.

The food came quickly and was delicious . . . the coleslaw though looked more like a garden salad . . . this time we decided to have desert and I ordered some kind of polish pudding . . . it was out of this world.

The only reason that I gave it four stars was due to the fact that the service was a little slower than I usually like . . . not sure if this was because I needed to get going to an afternoon meeting, or if it was because the place was busy . . . does it truly really matter . . . probably not . . . because I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The party is a poppin' at the BC! Who doesn't love a little Beaver?! 

My friends and I have a million jokes after dining here one night. Being concerned for a group for 6-9, I went ahead and made a reservation a few days beforehand, which the number ended up changing the night of [they weren't upset]. We all arrived about the same time and there was a nice Reserved sign on the table and water + glasses all set. It wasn't terribly busy [maybe since it was a weeknight?] so had I not made it, probably could've dined without a reservation. Since the restaurant was fairly dead we had great service. Our waitress was quite helpful with selecting dinner, water refills, questions, bill splitting, etc etc. Our group found it hilarious we ate on a few glass patio tables.

I would kind of lump the menu at Beaver Choice as \"eastern European\" rather than just Polish and German. The Thursday special is unlimited perogies + soup + salad for $12. About half of the group went with that. It is self-serve at a buffet warmer with 5 different perogy flavors, all which those friends ended up loving! The other half of us went with various schnitzels. Forewarning, if you order regular schnitzel, the porcini mushroom sauce is more thick gravy than what I expected. So much food though for that option I picked! Schnitzel + mashed potatoes, salad, salad, and sauerkraut. The salads weren't terribly good [not a fan of putting a cold side with warm food]. The dill mashed potatoes were fairly plain so I ate them with the mushroom sauce. The schnitzel did not need the sauce, it was fabulous on it's own. Saurkraut? Meh, I don't really like it in general but it was pretty good. 

They do have a great beer menu [great mix of domestics and international] so I went with a pint of the Leibinger Hefe... BIIIIG beer [but you pay $7 for it] and worth the cost. 

I'll definitely have to come back for more Beaver!"}
{"text":"Want something different and adventurous? Check this place out. There is no other Scandinavian restaurant in town that offers German, Hungarian, and Canadian cuisine under one roof. Sure this place is a bit pricy, but in my opinion it's worth the price."}
{"text":"I reserved a table for five at Beaver Choice for my birthday celebration last night. The dinner was my second visit to the restaurant with a group. The last visit was close to a year ago and was a great  experience, both the food and the service. My group all agreed that the food was great on this visit, but the service/business practices were not. As another reviewer has noted, we had to ask the server for everything. He seemed disengaged, like we were an imposition. He would be gone for long periods of time, not helping other customers (the place was only half full) but completely out of sight. The place has a full bar but when we called him over to order drinks and I ordered a cocktail, he said there was no bartender that evening so we could only order wine or beer; then walked away without taking the order. We spent quite awhile reviewing the menu, primarily because the server wasn't coming to take our order. After we had made our choices and beckoned him back is when he decided to tell us the lengthy list of items they didn't have that evening, including any meat perogies, polish coquettes, and the meal I had chosen for my birthday dinner. We then spent more time making other choices. As mentioned, the food itself was great. We asked for the check. One of my friends had ordered the Thursday special, listed on the menu as $11.95. Her bill showed it as $13.95. When questioned the server said the new price was on the door, and made no effort to change her bill to the menu listed price. We all agreed that was terrible business practice. I also was surprised that no mention was made of my b-day by the server or owner; no complimentary small dessert etc. My friends had me wear a b-day hat and the owner had asked if it was a special occasion when I reserved, then indicated they would be acknowledging that in some way. Not a big deal if the rest of the experience had been satisfactory. Definitely won't go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"the food is great, the people are monsters.  i have loads to say about them, but its really not worth talking about.  i would suggest getting everything take out."}
{"text":"5 stars for food.  5 stars for service.  5 stars for cleanliness & speediness!  My Gram and I decided to eat here since she is a fan of Scandinavian food.  This place is KILLER good.  I literally had to hand my fork & knife over to my Gram because, while I was totally stuffed from the lunch portion of Jager Schnitzel, I was ready to shovel every last bit into my mouth.  The coleslaw, potato salad, thyme potatoes, green bean salad, Hash were all PERFECT.  The green tea was perfect!  The service was perfect!   The (literally) second we walked in the door we were happily greeted and when we mentioned that my Gram couldn't have gluten or dairy he immediately called over his mom to discuss choices.  Turns out, she can have pretty much anything because they will cook it to order!  (And she could even get a gluten free beer!!)

(Can you tell we left totally happy?)"}
{"text":"Just had dinner tonight for the first time at Beaver Choice and it won't be my last time.  It's my new favorite restaurant in the east valley.  We had crab cakes for an appetizer that were delicious.  I had the chicken schnitzel parmigiana that was superb with dill potatoes, beet salad and green peas.  My friend had the pork hunter schnitzel with mashed potatoes and arugula salad.  I tried his pork schnitzel and it was equally as good.  The 2 servers were very friendly and their service was awesome.  Hannah the owner sat and talked with us and was a real delight.  Being a former restaurant owner I appreciated everything that I experienced tonight.  I will definitely be back and will tell my friends to visit the Beaver Choice."}
{"text":"There aren't many places to eat Swedish food; I am delighted that Beaver Choice has chosen Tempe as their home.  We arrived at Beaver Choice before 6:30PM on a Friday night.  While waiting for our table, we decided to order our food first.  I had ordered the chicken cordon bleu schnitzel.   My friends had the Kottbullar (Swedish meatballs), pork schnitzel, and angus burger.  After sitting at our table for over an hour patiently waiting for our food, we noticed a large group came after us had all their food served.   We started to wonder when our food will come out.   The owner's son ensured us that it will be out soon.  After another 30 minutes had gone by, the owner came out to apologize that our ticket got stick in the back of the large group.  As a consolation we were offered the Quebec Poutine on the house.  We were starving by now.   The Quebac Poutine is french fries topped with cheese curds and hot beef gravy - so yummy.  We finished that quickly.  When the food finally arrived, my chicken cordon bleu schnitzel was big, very juicy, crispy, and all the sides were delicious.   The meatballs were savory and well-accompanied by mashed potatoes and lingonberry preserves.  This is no Ikea frozen meatballs!  Unfortunately, my friend's angus burger came out rare.  She had to send it back to the kitchen and wait again.   The owner was nice enough to put this on the house as well.  We were all so full, but just couldn't resist ordering some desserts to take home.  We ordered almost one of each item from the dessert counter from Beaver Supreme, butter cookies, beaver balls (it's not what you think.), and cream puffs.   Although, it wasn't the best first time experience, overall the food was fantastic and affordable.  Europeans know what a proper portion size is!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when the new location finally opened in Mesa.  I have been a loyal fan of Beaver Choice, and have highly recommended to all my friends to try it.  Tonight, I was extremely disappointed at the whole dining experience. 

We had all placed our orders at the same time. The waitress indicated that the kitchen was behind and it will take about 5-10 minutes to put the ticket inside.  We agreed.  Another friend came after we just placed the order, sat over 20 minutes without any type of service (no water or even a menu).  She had to get up to ask for them.  I know you have expanded but might just need to hire more staff to help on weekends.  We all had to ask for refills many times.    

After 1/2 hour of waiting, we noticed the tables around came after us got their food
even few ate and left.  I felt it was a deja vu moment reminded me the very first time I visited in the Tempe location.  They had lost our ticket and we waited over an hour too. However, the owner came out to our table to apologize.  

This time when the owner came around to chat, we mentioned we have not received our food and indicated that tables around already ate and left. By now, it's over an hour!  
We are very patient people, others would have left by now.     

The owner came back with our waitress showing us the time that the waitress placed our orders on the POS receipt.  We knew we had placed the orders way before time indicated on the receipt.  The owner kept telling us they prepare it freshly and will take time to cook.  Again, I was loyal customer so I should know how long a normal schnitzel takes.  Over 1 hour is just unacceptable!  I felt I was in the episode of Amy's Baking Company when the owner accused the customers they were wrong.  I know the owner here is not Amy and Sammy. The family working in this establishment are much better than that.   I really hope tonight was just an one-time incident."}
{"text":"I just want to say, I found this place (by chance) while searching for a place in Mesa/Phoenix that served poutine. I was craving it badly, and I was so happy when I saw it on the menu! It tasted great! I also wanted to share that, I really liked the cozy atmosphere and the wait staff was so friendly. Love the hospitality! The hostess, even allowed us to sample some of the pierogi , and those dumplings were amazing!! They really fill you up, my favorite is the jalapeno ones!! I will be visiting soon!!"}
{"text":"We had to be patient because it was pretty busy and their ordering system was a bit chaotic.

I ordered the chicken cordon bleu and the bf ordered the burger with cognac dressing.

Our salads were spinach, tomato basil, peas, and green beans. Stay away from the green beans, they were terrible - however everything else was tasty.

The owner offered us samples of salmon, beet salad and potato salad. I like it all might try it next time. The mashed potatoes were delish not too buttery which I like. The ambiance was super weird in my opinion, nothing matched, the colors were off...but I saw the \"regulars\" and newbies and it was nice to support a local new restaurant.

The \"waitress\" had on this weird smock that the owners make her wear and it seemed a tad humiliating...I'm a little split on this place, a lot of good but a lot of weird/bad things made me feel funny.

Hopefully they will find their groove soon and make it a more smoother and enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Outstanding selection and variety. Menu has influences from Germany, Italy, Nordic countries, Poland etc...Very Attentive service by Sam. Had the pork Schnitzel and it was scrumptious. A bit of a drive but well worth it. Prices are very reasonable. Owners are super sweet. I was too full to order dessert. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Beaver Choice. The Cordon Bleu Schnitzel is fantastic, and everyone at our table loved the blue cheese stuffed mushrooms. Authentic Scandinavian, Polish, and German food, and authentic beers available."}
{"text":"We end up here a couple times a year. I have dropped my review by 1 star because there is a problem every single time we go there. The service is super slooooow always, even if you are the only group in the place. The prices are also a little on the pricey side. 

That said, go there knowing it is going to be 90 minutes or so, expect them to mess up at least one of the orders and know you are going to throw down some cash. it is still worth a visit (or 2) a year. The elk stew is amazing, and you aren't going to get it anywhere else. Hanna still tries to make you feel like family. 

You take the good with the bad to get the delish food. Just don't go there hungry or with people you don't like :-)"}
{"text":"Don't pass up this place! The people are delightful and the food is incredible. I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoyed both our meals, the meatballs are amazing and ALL the sides are great as well.  Our waitress gave good advice on what to order and she was always there to refill our drinks.  The owner is a sweat heart and you can really tell she cares about her business.  I will be telling all my window cleaning customers to eat at Beaver Choice because good cooking is hard to find in Arizona."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp because of the high ratings of others so another couple, my wife and I decided to give the odd-named restaurant a try. As we pulled up I became very concerned that we had chosen the wrong place. It didn't look like a nice restaurant, more like a low-budget Mexican food joint. Entering into the place didn't make us feel any better:  it was small, so brightly lit that you almost need sunglasses, and sparsely decorated. 

We went up to the counter (yes, that's right, no server to take your order even though they have a menu) to get a menu, then sat down to choose dinner and then got back in line to place our order. 

We ordered the Swedish meatballs, chicken cordon bleu, and pork tenderloin skewer. We split the three dishes between the four of us. Pork was pretty good, meatballs were amazing and the chicken cordon bleu was delish. 

Food was definitely 5 stars, as was the owner if the restaurant. She was very nice and helpful. 

I took a star off for the ambience, but as the owner explained, that will change in the future. They are moving to a full size restaurant once the two year lease is up in February. 

We will definitely go back again, but probably not until they are at the new location. If you haven't been to Beaver's Choice, it's definitely worth it. Don't expect much from the setting yet, but the food and friendly owner are great."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! You won't be disappointed.

When I read \"Scandinavian\" being the ignorant to the type of food they serve, I was concerned that it wouldn't be good but in fact the food was absolutely delicious. In fact it seemed very familiar, as many of our home cooked meals are influenced by this type of food. 

Go give it a try. And the lady running the place is awesome. She is very nice and wants you to enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"My husband had the jäger schnitzel.  He kept cutting it into smaller and smaller bites because it was so tasty that he didn't want it to end.  I had the elk stew, which was also very good: plenty of tender meat in a rich creamy sauce over noodles.  I'd give it 5 stars but the service, while friendly, was slow.  Reservations are in order.  We were there on a Saturday, and if we hadn't decided to eat early we wouldn't have gotten a table.  The place filled up quickly."}
{"text":"Beaver Choice?

Uh...Yes, Please!

I thought it was a question...a natural mistake.

You see, I love Beavers...after all, I come from Oregon, the Beaver State (state motto - \"M'mmmmm, that's some mighty tasty Beaver\") and I have spent so many years pursuing Beavers, frolicking with Beavers, really, just delighting in Beavers in all their many guises!

I have stalked, trapped and released back into the wild...(I'm a conservationist) more Beavers than I can count...from adorable Golden Beavers and the elusive California Shaved Beaver to the wild and wily Crimson \"Fire\" Beaver...I guess you could say that I am Beaver enthusiast!

The Beautiful Carin put an end to my halcyon days of hunting wild Beavers...really, I'm much happier for it...and calmer.

That said, I was going to drop by Ted's for a wiener at lunch and saw the sign for this adorable little place (I personally think that it's no coincidence that Beaver Choice occupies a cozy little spot very near Ted's Wiener Emporium), and I thought, \"Donald, let's go get us some Beaver\".

Well, it turns out that Beaver Choice is a terrific little Scandinavian restaurant...for Scandinavians...like me!

As I looked over the menu, I saw things I hadn't seen since I was a kid...things I hadn't seen since I was last at that great Smorgasbord place back in Portland that I can't remember the name of...the stuff that Nordic dreams are made of!

Gravlax, Kåldolmar, Laxpudding, Fylld Lövbiff...and fries!

I had a smoked salmon sandwich that was well made, tasty and filling (oh, don't worry...I didn't upset the subtle forces of nature by eating too healthily...I had fries, too!).

While they do have several vegetarian options on the lunch menu, I would remind you that the sweet little family that owns and operates Beaver Choice is Swedish (by way of Poland)...Scandahoovian...like me...and we never met a vegetable or fruit that we didn't think was better boiled, fried, baked, distilled or fermented...just sayin.

But I am going back...the only thing better would be if these guys would open up a smorgasbord place...but then they would have to contend with me pretty much wallowing in the buffet tables...and nobody wants to see that.

Drop by Beaver Choice the next time you are in that part of the world!

Even if you're not a Beaver Enthusiast (like I am), I'm sure you'll find something to eat."}
{"text":"This has to be one of my favorite places to eat!  The food is very very flavorful and plentiful.  

Try the schnitzel.  Fresh and hand made.  They make everything from scratch here.  The food takes quite awhile to come to the tables, but it is all hand made from scratch.  They even have board and card games to play while you wait for your food.

Have questions about anything and all you have to do is ask Kris at the counter.  Everything you try here, you will like.  I will eat anything here and wish I lived closer, I would definitely eat there more often."}
{"text":"Great authentic polish, Scandinavian and more! A must return and highly recommended.

We heard about the new location and enjoy polish and Scandinavian cuisine. The opportunity arose where we found ourselves in the area for lunch and we quickly navigated to the location. It was easy to find with a highly visible sign. I can understand how if you were coming from the other direction, you might miss the signage. 

We walked in and we greeted immediately and asked to select our seats. The owner came over within seconds and introduced herself, made beer recommendations and took our drink order. Before she was more than five feet away, the bus girl had waters on the table. Our waitress was there with our drinks a few minutes later.

Our food selections included Bratwurst served with cabbage and horseradish, small order of poutine (our fave from Canada), pork schnitzel with mushroom gravy, beet salad, pickled beets, and potato salad. 

All the food was delicious and left us wanting to return again. 

The Brat was a little under seasoned but tasty and served on a grilled sesame seed bun. I especially loved added the garnishments. 

The poutine was good, but possibly the gravy was not what we might find in Quebec (not traveling there anytime soon). I would have like larger cheese curds. The fries were amazing. Super crispy and piping hot. 

The pork schnitzel was very crispy, well seasoned, great texture and just perfect. The mushroom gravy was super tasty, perfectly salted, peppered, and with a great mushroom taste.

Potato salad was delicious. We haven't had really good potato salad since we moved here a few months ago. The salad has tiny cubed potatoes, likely in a a mayo-mustard base and well seasoned with pepper and salt. It was perfect.

The beet salad was something I never saw before, but my husband recalled his Grandma making. It was like pickled beets, cut up in cubes, and mixed with a sour-cream base. It was good and very pink!

The pickled beets hit the spot and were perfectly vinegar based.

We cannot wait to return and try more items such as cabbage rolls, pierogies, and more schnitzel.

The owner continued making rounds with guests, inquiring about how the food was. Our drinks were never empty and our server, Rebbecca was very prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I love this little place, i hope the family who owns and operates it will prosper for a long time"}
{"text":"Great food, made with love and lots of attention to detail.  I love that they served a bit of bright fresh color along with the heavier meat, potatoes and sauce. Great combinations. Prices are very fair for proportions. I'd come again, gotta taste the crepes soon!!"}
{"text":"Took the family to try something a little different. We ordered the cabbage rolls, chicken schnitzel and Swedish meatballs. The cabbage rolls were mediocre, schnitzel was ok and the meatballs were pretty good. The side dishes / salads on the other hand were not that great. The place was pretty busy and it seemed like the number of staff was not enough to cover all tables so service was not that great. Guess it's back to my kitchen if I want cabbage rolls."}
{"text":"Kid-friendly but not kid-accommodating. Bring your own child booster seat or if your child is still too young/little for one of those bring your stroller.

The food was decent and I would go back again but I will be better prepared for the 45 min wait on our food and bring seating for my child.

The restaurant lacked some organization. As a rookie I was quite unclear of the process. Ask the Scandinavian srver/cashier/bus boy (all the same guy) - he is very friendly and helpful but you have to ask.

We saw a couple wait 30 mins or so before ordering because they thought there wouldn't have been a place to sit. They waited to order and the guy said, \"oh I'm sorry you were waiting, you could have ordered...i didn't know you were waiting.\"

This isn't a location conducive to large parties. A party of 4 is plenty."}
{"text":"Went there for a girls night out. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of the eclectic menu.  She answered all of our questions and accommodated the dietary needs of a person in our group.  I  ordered the Skomakarlada (known as Shoemakers Box)  While very delicious it lacked  seasoning, I added a bit of salt.  I also requested the pickled beets.  The pickled beets were amazing!  And is it weird that I loved the bright pink color?  I will definitely go back again to try the Stuffed chicken breast as the other girls got that and gave high marks for that. The atmosphere is open and airy with plenty of room so as to not feel crowded.  We were also treated to live music! I am not sure if that is an every night thing because  we were there on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for years and finally had a chance to get here.  Being from the Midwest, I grew up with all sorts of Northern European dishes and Beaver Choice did not disappoint!

We were greeted by a wonderfully pleasant woman who is the owner.  She is the type of lady who is so sweet and positive, you just want to hug her.  We spent a little time at the bar, the wine menu is a little limited and the pours small, but the beer selection was awesome, a lot of imports from all over Europe.

?We were seated and had issues with the service throughout the night.  Our server was slow, slow to take our order, slow to come check on us, and seemed to avoid our table in general.  We also had issue with our entrees coming out and missing some items, or just missing entrees entirely.  We ordered some appetizers and received a plate of complimentary perogis to share.

I ordered the Scandinavian Sampler (Swedish Meatballs, Gravlax, and a Mini Shoemaker's Box) while the boy ordered the Polish Sampler.  Our server did not ask anyone what kind of Perogis they wanted or tell us what flavors were available that day.  All the food was great and reminded me of all the comfort food I ate growing up. Each dish came with 1 large side and 3 smaller sides.  I loved their potato salad and their horseradish and beets were awesome!?  The Boy shared some of his Polish Sausage with me (get your mind out of the gutter) and it was a must order as well.  Crisp snap of the casing and good flavor for the meat.

Will definitely be back, I suggest making a reservation as the place is on the medium small side.  I really want to come back on Thursday for their unlimited Soup, Salad, and Perogi special for $11.95. I hope they iron out the serving situation, it was the only thing keeping them for 5 stars with this review."}
{"text":"\"Yippee and yum-ooo,\" says my stomach.

This place is managed with the friendliest staff (probably owner and family). Food was hearty, home cooked, piping-hot goodness. 

4 stars because of a great ethnic culinary experience, its  tasty food and kind staff. With all these positives I was able to overlook one big factor that is a big deal on most days, when you just don't have the time.

I'm talking wait time to get food. Please come before you feel hungry. I had to wait close to 45-55 minutes for my plate. Also if you come with a plus one, don't be surprised if your plates do not get served at the same time. My boyfriend got his dish 15-20 minutes before mine. I watched him eat and vice versa. Other tables I noticed experienced the same."}
{"text":"A lot of my friends had been talking about this place! So, my boyfriend and I tried it. The waitress/ hostess was awesome! She was very helpful with questions and attentive. I got the chicken Schinzel cordon bleu on a bun. It was great. I've never had Scandinavian/polish food. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"First this place has an authentic amazing menu for Swedish, Polish and German food, and the owner is a huge sweetheart.  We were in the mood to find German food and found this on Yelp. Each dish we ordered was amazing- elk stew, swedish meatballs and chicken schnitzel. All of the food was fresh and delicious.  Each dish was authentic- ligonberries w the meatballs, schnitzel was flattened and lightly fried. Nothing was greasy.
There are wines and beers from Europe,  but not much for mixed drinks. 
It was packed but we had reservations.  The staff and owner were a little flustered by the large crowd. Once we were seated, the owner came by several times and checked that things were good. You can see the owner knows and enjoys her customers. 
We loved the food, and we are going back to try more dishes. Service was excellent.  The place is very nicely styled. This place is great and is worth multiple visits to work through the large menu!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I had the Viking schnitzel and it was delicious. My boyfriend and I also shared peirogis and the Polish custard. The food was clearly home made and the portions were giant! Definitely took some home. We met the owner and she was lovely! She even offered to share a recipe! The place has a cool relaxed vibe and the owner clearly loves to share food she has learned to make from her travels. We will definitely be back and we are bringing friends next time."}
{"text":"So I went here tonight with a friend. I was really excited and nervous to try this place after reading the reviews. So you walk in and walk up to the counter to order. I got the chicken with cardamom sauce and my friend got a hamburger (boring!). So you also get to choose a side and three salads. I got the mashed potatoes, the tomato and basil salad, the spinach, and the broccoli. So the chicken was really good, especially with the mashed potatoes. As good as this was, though, the salads were the best part. The tomato basil was really flavorful and fresh and the spinach was really good with the honey mustard dressing. The broccoli was just that, plain broccoli... so not awesome, but not bad. My friend really enjoyed his burger and said that he does not usually like salad, but liked the salads here. So overall this place was really good and I will definitely be back to try other menu items in the future. All the people who work there are really friendly and they all have accents... very authentic. Oh, and I didn't try them, but they also sell chocolate beaver balls... actual name."}
{"text":"I can not even give this place one star.   But Yelp won't let me continue and post without touching at least one star.  First we waited 20 minutes to be seated.  The restaurant was not busy.  The woman who finally acknowledged us said we could sit anywhere.  Would have been nice to know up front.  Waited 20 minutes for water. Waited 15 minutes for drinks. Had to ask twice to place our order. Then waited 30 minutes for our food, then it came cold, told the owner and she stood there and argued with us.  COLD is COLD, told her feel it for your self, she would not.  Never even offered to warm up the food, left us sitting there until she brought the bill and would not even offer to adjust the bill.  And demanded we pay the entire balance.  We did not eat the cold food. She said and I quote as we walked out after paying the full price \"I hate this country\"
so you decide if you want this business to serve you......."}
{"text":"Super friendly owner, and waitress, ah-may-zing food, will definitely come back... House was a bit empty, and service was prompt.  I cannot say enough good things about it."}
{"text":"Our first experience at Beaver Choice was about a week after they opened in their original location. It was cramped (the 4 of us had to share a table with another family); the service was disgraceful, and 2 of the meals were complete inedible. If ever a restaurant deserved to close quickly, this was it. It took a couple of years before the positive reviews made us curious enough to try again. Just my husband and I this time. We were amazed with the improvement - better facilities, better service, and the food was a huge improvement. 

A couple of things still cause me to only put in a 3-star rating: My husband's entrée (the pork belly) was terribly overloaded with onion, and while I have nothing against frozen peas, they are not a salad and it's silly to list them as such on the menu. The green bean salad features canned green beans - really?! 

My pierogies were very good (which surprised us because on our first visit they were complete mush). Overall, the improvements were considerable, and we may return again."}
{"text":"We tried Beaver Choice for the first time today and it was excellent! The pierogies were delicious and reminded me of my family's cooking from back home. We also had the Viking schnitzel with dill potatoes and it was so good as well. Everything was very fresh and flavorful. For dessert the Beaver Supreme was one of the best things I've had in a long time, and very unique. We'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I still think they're great....I used to go here when they were at their old location in Tempe on McClintock/Broadway and continue to go when I can.

They would have received 5 stars, but the service we received from our server wasn't so great.  We had a friend in from out of town, and wanted to show him this place, because I really enjoy the food and the family atmosphere.  The thing he orders is apparently not being served anymore at the restaurant (along with 2 other items), but our server failed to mention this to us when we sat and she brought us menus.  She finally informed us of this menu change AFTER our friend ordered this and said....Oh, I should have told you before.  You think?  That would have been helpful information.  Our friend had to now find something new, so asked what the soup of the day was.....to which, she didn't know. She had to go find out. We didn't get iinto the restaurant until closer to 8pm....so she would have almost worked an entire shift by then.  She most definitely should have known at that point.  I used to serve, and to me this laziness (or whatever it was) isn't acceptable.

I know that this isn't how the restaurant is typically run....at least from the other times that I've been in.  This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.  The food was still delicious....especially the poutine and rosti (love those items), but the service could definitely use some revamping."}
{"text":"Highest quality food, worth the price and the wait!!! NEVER A  DISAPPOINTMENT! Usually get the lamb (imported from New Zealand) but forced to try something new. Now the elk stew is on my list of favorites along with the dill potato salad! Also if you love coffee like I do you have to get the French pressed coffee, one cup is never enough even in the middle of summer in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Service is pretty laid back but attentive.  If you love poutine, it's a must have here.  Very accurate and traditional, but you can add bacon if you want for a little twist.  I had the Viking Schnitzel, which was very good. Others in the party had a mix of Schnitzel and the Shoemaker's Box, which everyone enjoyed.  The owner is very nice and loves to interact with guests.  Definitely worth a try if you're looking for something traditional and delicious."}
{"text":"Came back with my girlfriend. 

Ordered the chicken cordon bleu and it was tasty :) The brie cheese isn't that strong though. It sort of melts and mixes with the juices of the chicken. Much better portion size than the sandwich before and more variety in the flavors. This was a much higher quality dish.

The mashed potatoes were very good. We also tried the crab cake which had a sweet salsa and some sort of caviar on top as well as a side salad. Pretty tasty! 

My girlfriend had a pita wrap which was the right size for the price. The pita fell apart really easily though.

Still sort of pricey but I guess it's reasonable for the uniqueness of the food. 

Food took a long time, but it helps playing with the games to pass the time. I suggest planning a lot of time to eat here, or calling in your order ahead of time.

I'd come back if I needed a change of pace, but not sure I'd ever crave a place like this."}
{"text":"It was our first time really trying this style of food.  Overall we were underwhelmed.  What we at tasted pretty good.  I had a stuffed chicken breast and it was a bit too rare for my taste.  The desserts were great.  The pirogies were really good!  Tuesdays (I am pretty sure) they have an all you can eat pirogie special.  That would definitely be worth checking out."}
{"text":"Finally went to try this restaurant last night. It was a Friday night, busy but not packed. The booths were taken, so we sat at one of the glass tables. Service was attentive.  We received 2 perogi to try as we read thru the menu. As a lover of perogi, this small gesture made me very happy!

Both my husband and myself ordered the chicken  cordon bleu schnitzel as our meal. It was absolutely delicious. Thin chicken breast with ham and brie cheese, lightly battered with breading, almost a panko type breading. We both tried the mushroom topping as well, but neither of us liked it. They use porcini mushrooms, which are very earthy tasting.  I think it is too overpowering for the already flavorful schnitzel. 

With the dinners,  you get one side and 3 salads. It is a lot of food. I tried the dill mashed potatoes,  of which you get two large scoops. I also got the cole slaw, beet salad (chopped beets in a cream sauce), and tomatoes with basil. All were delicious. The husband got the rosti (kind of like a potato pancake), tomatoes and basil,  and a side salad with lemon vinagrette dressing. I tasted the dressing and it was a creamy but sweet lemony dressing. 

We also had ordered an appetizer of perogi before hand. 3 of the 3 cheese and 3 of the meat. Both choices were delicious. We got them with both the onions/bacon and the sour cream. It was 75 cents extra but definitely worth it. Try the pan fried option. The 2 perogi they brought initially were deep fried and we didn't care for them as much. 

Overall we were super pleased with our meal. It is a little more in cost than our usual places we eat at weekly, but very high quality and flavor. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is what real food should taste like.

We went on a Friday evening and enjoyed a free sample of pierogis, the stuffed mushroom appetizer, one schnitzel platter and the shoemaker's box. The schnitzel was amazing. The shoemaker's box was also very tasty but came with way too big of a serving of mashed potatoes (would have preferred a second side instead).

The service was on-par and our waiter helped answer all questions we had. The desserts looked awesome but we didn't imbibe in them this time, maybe next."}
{"text":"Went in with two other couples after hearing rave reviews...we were seated and got our drinks in a reasonable amount of time. It took quite a while for the waiter to come back and take our order and answer our questions about the many items to choose from on the menu. We can't complain about the quality and presentation of the food which I would have added on another star for but we had to flag down our waiter for everything including! Need water? Want to ask how much longer? Order desert? Want your check? Want your card back after sending it off with the bill? Wait, wait, and wait some more but not before you flag someone down and then it takes another 10+ min. We spent well over 2 hours there which shot the rest of our evening. I like to enjoy the dining experience without feeling rushed but the service definitely crossed the line."}
{"text":"What a unique gem of a restaurant!  I love that this place serves foods and drinks that are totally out of the norm for the Phoenix area.  I had never had Scandinavian food prior to this (unless you count the IKEA cafeteria? which, no, you probably don't count that) and I was excited to try something new.

Being new to this cuisine, I decided to try the Scandinavian sampler plate for $20 so I could get a little taste of everything.  It comes with 3 meats, 1 side, and 3 salads.  I liked the cured salmon, but it was a little strange to have it just by itself since it was so salty. I felt it needed some bland potatoes or bread to balance it out.  The meatballs were my favorite meat.  The plate also came with gnocchi, which was my favorite part of the meal!  Comfort food at its best.

My least favorite part of the meal was the beet salad.  From the pictures in the menu I thought the beet salad would just be big chunks of beets with a sprinkling of cheese.  What came out was little chunks of beets mixed in with a cream (maybe mayo?).  I don't really care for mayo and the \"salad\" ended up being hot pink, which I know is due to the beet color but was just a little off-putting for my tastes.

My dining companion got the elk stew, which I tried a bite of.  It was really yummy and filling.  His dish also came with a tomato salad that was incredibly good!  I don't know where they get their tomatoes, but they are so flavorful and not like the lame bland tomatoes you get at the grocery store.

I will definitely be back again to try out some new dishes AND to try their desserts -- which looked HUGE and yummy."}
{"text":"Good service and great food!

We walked in on a Thursday evening and they weren't really busy.  We were greeted by a friendly lady (the owner?) as we walked in the door.  Decor has a modern (dare I say, IKEAish feel) to it with all the multi-color led lights that under light the bar.  Waitress was friendly and attentive.  

We began with an appetizer of latke's with bacon on top.  Delicious...wish there had been more so it served its purpose and definitely got my appetite going.  When we go again, I think we'd probably order them with the mushroom cream sauce on top to give that a try as well.  

I ordered the Jager Schnitzel for my entree.  I was born and raised in Germany so have some experience with the real thing and this was very comparable to some of the best schnitzels I've ever eaten in the U.S.  The potato salad on the side was also well made and delicious.

We had the rhubarb bake for desert and it was very good also.  

Price would be my only concern with this place as they're a bit higher than a normal sit-down type restaurant.  I'm not sure if they had other selections of beer, but from the menu I ordered from it appeared that the lowest price beer was around $6 or so.  I expect they probably have to import them as I've never seen any beer on their list at any other restaurant.  With an appetizer, two entrees, three beers and a desert the bill ended up being in the neighborhood of $90.00 with tip.

That being said, they've certainly cornered the market with this specialty type restaurant and I certainly look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Köstlich!  Pyszne!  Utsökt!

This has been in my bookmarks for the longest time and I regret not trying this place sooner!  Three of us stopped in at 7PM on a super busy Friday night and here's what we got:

SHOEMAKER BOX - $14.95
\"Skomakarlåda is a traditional Swedish Dish composed of a slice of pork loin served with gravy and mashed potatoes and typically garnished with diced bacon, mushrooms and chopped pieces of leeks. Mashed potatoes & house salad included.\"
- Solid dish! It's like eating a Swedish pot roast. The pork was moist, the gravy was super savory and rich and they topped the mashed potatoes well, and everything was seasoned perfectly. The only thing this dish needed was some texture. 

SWEDISH MEATBALLS - SVENSKA KÖTTBULLAR - $14.95
\"Swedish hand rolled cardamom meatballs served with cream sauce and lingon berry preserve.  Mashed potatoes & Swedish slaw included.\"
- Instead of mashed potatoes, I got Kopytka served with my order and I wasn't mad at all.  Delicious!  I love me some potato dumplings. This also gave us a chance to try something new. For the most part, the meatballs were excellent. You can definitely taste the cardamom, maybe a little too much. It permeates your taste buds. The whole dish is a grown-up and sophisticated version of Ikea's. The Swedish slaw was deliciously refreshing.

SCHNITZEL CORDON BLEU - $16.95
\"Lightly breaded pork loin or chicken breast sliced lengthwise and filled with black forest ham and French brie cheese, skillet fried to a crispy crunch, accompanied by house made porcini mushroom sauce.\"
- Hands down the best dish. That melted brie... oh man! You can't go wrong with a crispy chicken, brie, and ham roulade. It was served with the most under-seasoned country-style potatoes on the side. It was topped with dill but no amount of salt and pepper could give it flavor. There was also a tiny mountain of sauerkraut on the side.  Still though... holy schnitzel!

GOURMET CRAB CAKE - $8.95
\"Our crab cakes are prepared with no fillers and are composed of all-lump crab meat.  Topped with a house shrimp salad and Swedish caviar.\"
- The price is for ONE crab cake which made us all raise an eyebrow but we got one... and it was good. Like really good. It was definitely all crab and barely any filler. I don't recall shrimp in the salad so that was misleading but it was good. Topped with a creamy neutral sour cream, it was a nice starter. The caviar certainly made it seem fancy as well.

We washed it down with a Black Boss Porter [Polland] which was mild in flavor with a sweet finish.  We also got to try some pierogis on the house.  After trying these bad boys, I want to come back on Thursday where they have an AYCE pierogi special [starting at 5PM] for $11.95.  It includes AYCE pierogis, house salad, and a soup. Yaaas!"}
{"text":"Was really disappointed with this place. My family and I went there because we wanted to grab some appetizers before going to a movie. We were told that we weren't allowed to order just appetizers and that we had to order a meal as well. 

When the management came over we were told that if we wanted just appetizers we would have to pay a split plate charge... To share appetizers... It was a bummer because we were really excited to try this place out! 

It might have been ok if the owner/manager wasn't so angry at us for trying to order just apps and even went into the math of washing the dishes and how she would lose money 

I wouldn't go here at all..."}
{"text":"I finally checked out the new location for Beavers Choice and it was awesome. They have a larger dining room and a new bar with an excellent selection of beer. Upon arrival the friendly staff greeted me and I sat at their beautiful bar. I ordered a Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc with my chicken schnitzel lunch. it was even better than the last time I had it at their last location. A really good tomato basil salad accompanied my meal on the side and It was to die for. It was a pleasant experience and I will be back for more. Beaver on!!"}
{"text":"Good food, drinks and service. Wide selection of food and drinks. Will have to go back and try more dishes and desserts."}
{"text":"Went  to Beaver Choice for the first time today and it was simply outstanding. I had the Chicken with Cardamom sauce. This dish was excellent. The thyme potatoes were solid as a side dish, but the true standout of the salads was the Tomato-basil salad. Make sure you try the tomato-basil salad as one of your salads if you get one of the dishes that comes with the three salads. I'll be getting at least a double of those next time I go. This is not a place to go if you are in a hurry, but the food is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is very simple in all aspects. There is no decor or style. Food is bland and overpriced.  We ordered the crab cake as an appetizer, chicken schnitzel and scallops. The waiter brought 2 deep fried pirogies. I burned my tongue tasting it. Chicken schnitzel was simply just fried chicken with no flavor with a weird sauce. Scallops were good but there only 3 pieces ($25!). The sides were sour cabbage and mashed potatoes ($16). Every immigrant from Eastern Europe knows how easy and no cost to make this cabbage. My relatives would be shocked to know how much I paid to eat this cabbage. I don't think we will go back again and will not recommend it to my fellows from Eastern Europe. Authentic foods in Poland, Ukraine and Russia tastes much better."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I drove by here the other day and thought it would be neat to try some Scandinavian food. Not that we had any clue what Scandinavian food was. It might have been quicker to fly to Scandinavia to get our meal there but we didn't know this at the time. 

Upon arriving at the restaurant with our friends, a host asks if we had a reservation. We didn't know that one was needed but were lucky enough that another group didn't show. Seated at the table and having a minute to glance over the menu, the waitress comes by to ask for our drink orders. Since there was one drink menu and four of us, we asked for another minute. The waitress must have thought we said 45 minutes, cause that was approximately how long it took for her to come back to get our drink orders (During which time we saw another table or two, who had been sitting when we arrived, leave without getting any food or drinks). 

We decide to order our meals while the waitress was here since we had plenty of time to look over the menu a few times over at this point. My girlfriend ordered a red wine. Apparently it had the same name as a white wine since that is what the waitress brought back. Upon informing her of the mistake, she says \"Oh shit\" and leaves, to replace the wine we all assume. We see the waitress at the bar a few times to get other drinks but none come to us. About 30 minutes later, we ask the waitress where the red wine is and she finally replaces it. I guess you need to stress that you want exactly what you ordered when the waitress makes a mistake here. This is soon followed by the main dishes, with my dish missing one of the sides. After pointing out the mistake, the waitress quickly bring back the wrong side for me. Well this can be overlooked since I had never tried any of the sides offered and we all have delicious food to enjoy and share at this point. 

After the meal, we ask for the check. The waitress leaves for a few minutes and then returns to get the checks straight. Happy that she is trying to make sure everything is correct, the four of us explain who has what while the waitress writes. She then bring the checks with wrong items on each check. All the items are correct, just on the wrong checks. Happy that we weren't charged for 2 wines, we just settle the difference between friends rather than trying to deal with the waitress again and promptly leave. 

I really must give them credit since the food really was delicious. The problem is that the service was so bad. It wasn't even like the place was packed as I noted a handful or more tables that were empty during our meal, with people only leaving during our meal. I don't even know if I would trust a to-go order from here. Not without at least checking that it is all correctly there before going."}
{"text":"The Beaver Choice was and very joyful surprise ! From the quaint layout of the dinning/bar area with both and a few tables with plenty of more for Happy Hour Dancin !? I'm just saying : ), Anyway the Food was Fantastic !!! The Elk Stew was so flavorful and filling with just a hint of gamey to let you know you have the real thing. We also enjoyed the Sallops cooked to perfect with all the authentic pickled side that accompanied it ! Then of course we had to end it with a lovely dessert of Mandarin puff I'd call it ! : ) that melts in your mouth all natural ingredients and the also offer Gluten Free servings!  they also have a wonderful variety of authentic German beverages to go with the authentic German dishes !!! MUST TRY !!!
The service was GREAT, everyone was Friendly and Good spirted, and my Favorite was the Owner!  She was a Delite to talk to and she will visit your table at least once ! last but not least, if you something to take home to go with your leftovers, yes excellent portions! take a doz or two of Home made Pieorgies ! Do yourself a favor and stop by !!!"}
{"text":"Beaver Choice was a very clean restaurant and the staff are extremely friendly! I ordered the chicken rhubarb with grilled asparagus instead of cous cous. The sauce was creamy and delicious! The asparagus was very good! They give you the thicker asparagus and not the tiny skimpy ones. This is truly a gem of Mesa, you will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"This snug little place is moving to a larger space in the new year - just to let you know. It'll be near Extension and Baseline. Now... the food is good and prepared while you wait and and unusual. Definitely go with the Swedish Pork Schnitzel and the beet salad. The saurkraut is divine as is the large lacy cookie to have after dinner. Service is efficient but you will wait for your meal to be prepared - not a place to be in a hurry, ok?? But it's worth the wait and I will definitely go back. But... I will skip the peas. They were boring. Sorry."}
{"text":"I came here with the ISC crew and I ended up liking the place a lot more than I expected to. The new location is clean and bright (maybe too bright, they need to add some blinds to block the afternoon sun!) and very cheerful. Our service was good... there were a few mix-ups but that is expected with a large party.

The best part was the food. I got the Polish sampler and I couldn't believe how much food I got. Stuffed cabbage (golumpkis) and a few perogis plus the main attraction, either bratwurst or kielbasa) along with three veggie side (aka salad) choices and one starch. The portions of each of the veggie sides were fairly small but if there is something you really like you can double (or triple) up. For me, I wanted to try as many as possible so I got a variety. Pickled beets, green bean salad, tomato salad and Rosti (potato pancake). I know that for those of you who don't regularly eat Eastern European food some of these items may not sound so appealing but believe me when I tell you they were all delicious. My husband got the pork Schnitzel with the beef and mushroom gravy (Jagerschnitzel) and he was even more happy with his meal. Pretty much everyone at the table was remarking on how  good the food was and how much you got for your money.

Fortunately this place is not to far away from my home so I definitely will return!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is NOT this beaver's choice!!! Terrible service.... The manager/owner decided that there would be a $5.00 split fee for each of the three of the appetizers that we ordered. When asked about this, she informed us that this was a \"typical practice in 90% of restaurants\"..... For appetizers.....will never go back. #notthisbeaverschoice"}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place and finally did... By far one of the best places I've eaten at in a while. Pierogi's, chicken schnitzel, crab cakes, tilapia.... All very amazing! The owner is so friendly and inviting... The only problem I had is that I ate too much to fit dessert!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I had been to the previous location and loved the food.  I took my parents to the new location today, because we were all craving schnitzel.  We all got the Jager Schnitzel, and it was amazing.  I don't like mushrooms, so I asked for no mushrooms, and the gravy was wonderful and not mushroomy at all.  :)

The portions were huge, and each entree comes with one side and three salads.  There are many to choose from, and we enjoyed all that we tried (rosti potatoes, pickled beets, beet salad, tomatoes and basil, pickled green beans and cole slaw).  We all ate more than we should have because we just couldn't stop.  And, we all have another meal in leftovers to eat later.  

Someone on Yelp commented that dessert was a must, so we tried a vanilla bean pudding and it was tasty.  I don't know if I'd get it a second time, because it was over $7, but it was nice to share at the end of our meal.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were here for lunch today. The owner was our server. My first impression of the location was not great. It wasn't \"bad\" I just wasn't expecting it to be in a strip mall.  The interior was above average for a locally owned restaurant. It was clean but for a used fork that we found under our table, but that is forgivable. I had the pierogi meal and it was good. Admittedly, I have never had a \"great\" pierogi because there really isn't much you can do with them to make them stand out. They were on par with others I have had. My wife had the poutine and it was good. Not amazing but definitely good. A pal of mine shared his schnitzel cordon bleu and it was fantastic. I regretted the wasted Weight Watcher points i invested in the pierogies after tasting the cordon bleu. Back to the owner. She was very nice if not extremely familiar and comfortable with our group. We discussed other restaurants candidly as well as the difficulties surrounding compensating servers and kitchen help fairly. I learned a little about how a restaurant operates. Probably more than I cared to know but what he heck I learned a little. Would I come back you ask? Most definitely...and when I do I am getting the schnitzel."}
{"text":"Some immediate observations...

Food...good
People...nice
Service...uneven at best

I ordered a TUNBRÖDSRULLE which is advertised as the king of Swedish street food.  I saw Tony Bourdain eat one of these things on TV once and I put it on my list of things to do.  First, you should note this is certainly the only place in AZ where you can get a TUNBRÖDSRULLE and quite possibly the only place you can get one for several hundred miles in any direction.  So if nothing else they have the market cornered on TUNBRÖDSRULLE.

So you ask...what's a TUNBRÖDSRULLE?  Well, it's served with mashed potatoes, one or two sausages, salad, tomatoes and räksallad (shrimp salad) all wrapped in a soft thin tortilla bread and covered with a thousand island like sauce.  For the most part it tastes about like it sounds.  It wasn't bad, but to be sure its one more thing checked off my bucket list.  As a side note, if there was shrimp salad in the thing I couldn't detect it.  

Also ordered  the Jagar Schnitzle with fried potatoes.  It was actually quite good.

On an aside, I forgot how much Scandinavian food uses dill.  I'll be belching this meal for quite a while.

Overall a place I'd do again although I've sworn off TUNBRÖDSRULLE and will probably be a little more mindful of my dill intake in the future.

Somewhere between a  3.5 and a 4 but I'll round up for this one."}
{"text":"I'll start with the Good, the food was great that's where the one star comes from.  Now the bad.
1st we got there at 545 on a Saturday night.  The place was already full and we waited at the bar for 15 minutes before getting a table.  Nothing wrong with that BUT once we sat down we waited 15 minutes without a menu.  I had to ask for menus otherwise we'd still be waiting.
2nd it was another 15 minutes before anyone came over to take our order
3rd the wait staff was friendly but slow and disorganized.  It was obvious that the wait staff were not assigned sections like you would find in other restaurants which contributed to being forgotten about.  We didn't get a second glass of wine until we were just about done with dinner.
4th several people seated around us got some sort of complimentary dish, I believe they were pierogies, but we wouldn't know since we didn't get any.  I heard one of the wait staff tell someone at another table they were complimentary
5th sour cream for the pierogies is extra...really? Sour cream is EXTRA?
6th we got the Polish sampler which comes with pierogies.  Guess what?  You can't pick what pierogie you'd like.  We were told it's whatever is back there that will be put on the plate.  Plus the food came out cold.

So over all while the food was great it was a very frustrating experience and we weren't able to enjoy our dinner.  Not really worth going back to deal with all that.  Not sure what it's like at dinner time during the week but avoid Saturday night."}
{"text":"OMG I love this place. Places like these are the kind I live for. Its the diamond in the rough, the hole in the wall, the place you aren't too sure about and find that you love. The staff is incredibly polite, accommodating, and helpful. When we went in we were on a diet. We walked in close to closing time, but were more than happy to serve us anything we wanted. They were happy to make us fresh food that suited our diet. Anything that we were interested in that didn't fit the needs of our diet, they were eager to make what we wanted work or make other suggestions. The food is delicious. I can't wait to go back to this place again and again and again."}
{"text":"We were here yesterday to celebrate fathers Day early and was excited to try out a new restaurant. I really wish we would have picked a different place. 

When we first arrived, the restaurant just barely opened. A waitress and the owner welcome us to come in. The owner directed us to a table but I preferred to sit on booth. We asked for permission before sitting. She agreed. Then I realized I'm 100 lbs less than my dad and it was a tight fit for him. We got back up to sit on the table instead. I could see the owner giving us a look that says \"I told u so\". I don't know what the big deal is since there was no one else there at that time. 

Then, the owner asked my dad if we wanted appetizer. He said no. The owner actually said \"ok\" followed by rolling her eyes up. Seriously? When I ordered my dish, she asked me a question and I thought I heard medium or medium rare. I said medium rare please. Then she looked at me like I'm stupid \"we only serve it medium or rare. I'm asking you which one is it that you want\"? Ok at this point I already know I am not coming back regardless how good the food might have been. 

We have a table of 4. One meal arrived 15 minutes before everyone else. Her food started to get cold and we basically told her not to wait for us. All of our meals arrived at different time but that isn't a big deal for me. 

I tried the swedish meatballs and it was a bit too salty for my taste. The sauce is a bit watery. The hunter steak was a bit chewy so I didn't finish it at all. 

We paid our bills the already included gratuity (so tipping a different amount isn't even an option). 

I would have come back and tried something different if it wasn't for the bad attitude. My uncle is from Switzerland and I was going to bring him here. Apparently if you do speak her language, she would be a lot nicer. Another table came in later and she was the sweetest thing. Wow. 

Overall, the service is below average, the attitude is bad and the food is no more than average. I always want to support family business but probably not this one. If you think you are too good to serve customers, may be u shouldn't have a restaurant."}
{"text":"Went in on their 4th day open because I didn't want to wait in line at Ted's. They were eager to explain their menu and even gave me a sample of a few things. The family who owns the place (and seems to work there all the time)  recognized me (even though I'd only been there once) when I brought family back months later, and welcomed me in like I was an old friend. Food Is prepared like a home cooked meal made by your mother who happens to be a chef. Customer service is excellent, food is amazing, and I always leave wishing I could eat every meal there."}
