{"text":"I really like this place. While the ambience leaves much to be desired, the owners (they are also the chefs, wait staff and cahiers) are very warm and friendly. You can tell the difference between a pleasant welcome elsewhere and here where they are genuinely glad you came. The pizza was very fresh (not always the case mid afternoon in a Mom & Pop joint when ordering slices) with generous amounts of cheese and sauce. The fries (I hope my internist isn't on Yelp) were also very good. I was very happy to see they don't serve shoestring fries; but that's another story. I've been here often and never was disappointed. Don't let the appearance scare you. Priced very reasonably."}
{"text":"Best place for kosher pizza.  They have good prices and patient when taking orders."}
{"text":"Awesome food. I will definitely be back! 
Calzone (veggie and cheese) is boom. I asked for ranch and it was super good too. The lady that works there is really nice."}
{"text":"Service is not why you should visit this joint.
Food is why! Their subs are tasty and delicious. The wait is not so fun.. 
However the fresh food is what makes me keep coming back..

I have brought these suns to many who dont keep kosher and they continuously ask me to bring it again! 
I take into consideration their slow service by ordering in advance. Thats what you got to do to enjoy the great food here..."}
{"text":"i really like this place. i go here maybe once a week, i really like their sandwiches. as its the only thing ive had from here, ill stick to them.  its fast, no wait, and i get my food with a smile. considering i only paid ten bucks, i like the joint."}
{"text":"The food really is fantastic...if you're willing to wait for them to milk the cow and grow the wheat to make it. Getting your food takes FOREVER and the customer service and experience is non-existent. Plus I've never been to a pizza shop that doesn't have Parmesan cheese shakers or ketchup readily available. Personally I'd say the management just doesn't really care and that's how it feels when ordering, but aside for that the food is really quite good."}
{"text":"I was really expecting more of this place.

A co-worker of mine said it used to be THE place for a quick lunch and great sub. I'd forgotten my lunch one Monday and shot down 7th to give this little hut a chance.

As soon as I walked in, it smelt somewhat foul, like an old smell. The people behind the counter did have offer to help me pick out a meal or even greet me. Luckily they had some folded up menus on their counter or I woudn't have known what they served. The three stood there til I ordered, zero effort in acknowledging me as a paying customer. Finally, I ordered and the woman punched it in. For just a simple pizza sub it was roughly $8. Yikes.

Had to wait a good 15-20 minutes, in which I could hear the woman popping the sub in the microwave.. yeah for fresh.

When they handed me the sandwich I was REALLY disappointed. It was nothing more than a baguette cut down the middle, sauce and ome cheese. No meat, no seasoning, no nothing. Very disappointing place and the food wasn't that great. I actually felt really awful about myself for having ate it.

What a bummer."}
{"text":"Their food tastes SOOOO good! Nice family operating the place.
Their vegetable lasagna is amazing and it comes with the best garlic bread EVER! Their ranch sauce is the best I ever had.
I usually get pizza with mushroom and onions and ask them to make it well done and it's made to perfection."}
{"text":"Quick, Nice and friendly service. The place is really clean.  The food is delicious.  Large portions and cheep for kosher food."}
{"text":"Kosher alert!  I ordered a pizza sub with pepperoni and was met with weird looks.  Did not realize I was in a kosher eatery.  Oh, well.  It made for an interesting Christmas Eve dining adventure.

The pizza sub was fantastic.  Made with fresh mozzarella, bread and sauce made in house.  The sauce made the sub.  Good sauce always stands out and these folks have one of the best sauces around.  I can't wait to try the pie one day.  I am partial to slaughtered animal on my pizza but I am willing to do without.

Service was a bit slow but that is to be expected when your food is made fresh.  A good meal is always worth a wait."}
{"text":"Man I hate giving Mom and Pop places low reviews but it is what it is I guess first off what kind of pizza place opens at 12 kind of weird time to open considering lunch usually starts about 10 to 11 but that's their times know when you walk into place very slow no one is there little dirty so go to the counter and ask if you guys have slices she told me maybe not sure what the hell what do you mean you don't know you're not sure so she came back and said yes she has cheese so I got two slices of cheese she brings out looks pretty good pick it up pizzas hot but soggy it was cooked all the way through but not sure what was going on first bite tasted kind of odd cheese was okay not much flavor in the sauce little Bland get to the crust that's what I figured out what a remind me of a biscuit kind of taste like Pillsbury biscuit actually not really Pizza flavor get to the second slice it's fully cool down now I have to say very few times in my life I cannot finish to slice of pizza but this is one of those times cheese tasted really bad had a plastic flavor and the cheese wasn't melted any longer and all clumped together no good at all now for the service I'm not sure if it's there rude or at a language barrier because they don't speak English very well which is fine but everyone has a sour look on their face will not ever go back here again I would have weighed this place"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious! Honestly this place brings back the taste of NY pizza. You can tell they put effort into making their food delicious."}
{"text":"One of the lousiest lunches I've had in a long time. 

Caprese sandwich and breaded mushrooms with (curdled) ranch.

Sandwich seemed to come with strange rectangular processed mozzerela, and, aside from the strong purple onions, it was practically flavorless.

The breaded mushrooms were the skinniest shape and weirdest texture...seemed like I was biting into really dry fried cornmeal or something, there was no plump mushroom texture at all! Or taste! Were they real mushrooms? I don't know, I threw them out after one bite. The ranch dressing was curdled anyway (!!!), so they were beyond salvage.

Girl who took my order on the phone was (as others have mentioned) mumbly and careless, didn't even ask my name before ending the call. Chef/cashier was hard to talk to also, once he eventually came out, 5 minutes after I (one of two customers) arrived.

Weeeeeeeeeird place...baaaaaaaaaad food..."}
{"text":"Really good slice of pizza. Walked in yesterday looking late afternoon snack. Ordered a slice and a soda. When the slice arrived it was piping hot and fresh. The crust had a crunch that was a nice treat and even better there was hardly any grease. I was so impressed I'm going to order a whole pie tonight. Check out this small six table, family gem, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"This kosher pizza establishment is by far the most affordable, consistent, clean environment and the best kosher pizza joint in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"so I have to say. I have taken out food and loved it! The ambiance of dining in took away from the pie. I suggest you carry out. The location appears dirty and barebones. I will give it one more try, but too many choices for great Pizza in central phx."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in AZ. If you can get over the fact they outlawed meat and the customer service is bleak. But seriously. I don't live in AZ anymore and it's my first and last meal when I visit. The veggie pizza is so good I had to pull over in a parking lot and get a piece out of the back and eat it to hold me over before I got home!"}
{"text":"Everything I have ordered here, I loved! Their hand-made pasta is excellent! (Try the pesto pasta) The pizza and sandwiches are great as well! Expect to wait for your food because everything is made fresh; even if you are the only person in the restaurant, it will take some time...but the food is well worth the wait! Keep in mind the place is vegetarian/fish, so you wont get any meat options...but the food is so good you wont miss it!"}
{"text":"Tucked away, little \"hole in the wall place\". The pizza is the best local kosher pizza. The family who owns this restaurant is always friendly and helpful. Yes, as other reviews have stated, it does take awhile for your order to be prepared. Keep in mind it is being prepared fresh. I last ordered a pizza with basil. They actually have basil plants and put FRESH basil on my pizza."}
{"text":"This is my favorite kosher restaurant in all of Phoenix. The location is small yet comfy and the food takes a while to make... but it's so worth it knowing your food is fresh. Huge fan of the spinach and cheese ravioli. Overall, great quality."}
{"text":"A while back a friend brought over a white pizza from some central Phoenix pizza establishment that made me change the way i looked at cheese. I've been searching for it ever since, which lead me to finally give Manhattan a try the other day.

Why did it take so long when it is just down the street from me? This place is super fucking creepy. Just driving by it gives me the heeby geebies. Looks like a waffle house without the sweet giant globe lights. Or truckers, or anybody. Where are the people? How does it stay in business? Drug front?

I call and some woman mumbles into the phone like she is reacting to a soap opera. 

\"Ummm...is this manhattan pizzeria?\"

\"Yes, take your order?\"

Not a good start. I put in the order for the while pizza and they tell me it will be ready in 10. I give it closer to 20, and the pizza is still not ready, exactly what I had most feared. Me, alone, in the waffle-less waffle house and only my imagination to keep me company.

There is no decoration other then two old New York posters, no tv, no music, and no people except for the three immigrant workers speaking their eastern European dialect. 

They all seem angry. They keep on sniping at each other with short, curt comments.  It's like I got stuck in one of those indie dramas about a depressing immigrant families that gets really high reviews but no one ever sees because they are boring as hell. Maybe you rent it and watch the first half, but you are going to fall asleep before the troubled teenage daughter commits suicide.

Thank the heavens when the santa-esque chef finally comes out with my pizza and gets me my tiramasu. I get the hell out of there as soon as possible before they start throwing pans at each other.

And the result of my quest, pretty good pizza and tiramasu, but not mind-blowing like I hoped, and not worth the torture of sharing the immigrant drama.

Will I ever find that white pizza or was someone just having a really good day when they made it?"}
{"text":"I think it's funny that although the place is now kosher, due to the lack of name change there are still reviews of a salami sandwich and other meat former-options.
I have to say that the service is slow but extremely friendly- expect a long wait. I don't like the pizza. The calzone I had was a little dissapointing.
So why 4 stars?
There are limited kosher options in Phoenix. I think the pizza and the service will improve steadily- this is still a new place (as far as the re-opening anyway). Every pasta dish I have ordered have been stellar. Manhattan has a great sauce, so the eggplant rollotini I first ordered was absolutely delicious. The manicotti uses lasagna noodles, so I'm not sure its authentic, but it's very tasty. Hubski ordered the fish meatball sub (I thought he was crazy). Maybe I should have sampled it but I didn't. He loved it. LOVED it.
We'll go back for the pasta, apparently the fish-balls, and to support a local kosher business. I'm sure the pizza and speed of service will improve with time."}
{"text":"I would give 4 stars for the food, but overall is 3 stars. Reason is that the service is never very good. I always order the Little Cesar, its their salami sub. It's delicious, great meat on homemade bread that's always crispy. However, I have had to wait for a long time everytime I order. All I'm ordering is a sandwich that gets toasted in the oven, and I have to wait 25 minutes? But, I keep going back because the sandwich is THAT good and I love a good salami sub."}
{"text":"All of the food here is prepared fresh and therefore takes a little more time than \"fast food\" BUT everything we have tried over the years has been excellent. It is a bit difficult to go with a large party because this is a very small place. These are the negatives. The positives are the food. Delicious and reasonably priced. I recommend it highly. Reasonably priced, excellent  Kosher food. Try it, you'll like it!"}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than this. Delicious fresh subs and pizzas made to order. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So sad to see this neighborhood gem go veggie. The Italian was to die for. Oh well, too many other good restaurants in the neighborhood to bother with going here."}
{"text":"Have been dying to try this kosher place for some time.
Went tonight and ordered a large 3 cheese pizza.  O M G american cheese???
I asked also for baked ziti and the lady said her ziti can't keep for a week so they don't make it.
Are you kidding me?
It was 19.00 with a drink.
I put the pizza in the trunk and went to La Bella"}
{"text":"I've seen this pizzeria before and it was always closed. But today they were open. I tried the 2 slice cheese combo. 

Food took about 5 minutes to be ready. I was disappointed. The cheese had a weird texture with pools of oil on top. I realized that although it was hot from the oven, it was pre cooked and reheated. That's why the cheese was off. Some cheese just doesn't re-melt well. Also the center of the crust was a soggy mess. It was super thin and basically water logged mush. The outside of the crust was good. If I had ordered a custom pizza to go, I hope the results would be better. But I'm not finding out."}
{"text":"This review was really tough for me because everything about this place sucks except for one sandwich.

And here's the thing about that.

THIS SANDWICH IS LIKE JESUS.

It could be the most amazing thing I've ever tasted. I crave it fortnightly, no joke. 

Don't try the pizza and stay awaaaaaaay from the calzones. Try the Bronx Bomber. I swear to god you will probably scream some incredibly inappropriate exaltation after your first bite, that is, if you don't just lose all faculties and crap your pants right there in the shop.

Yeah, I'm pretty crazy about it."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place to everyone whether you're kosher or not!!!

So I don't usually like kosher food this place is bomb! I definitely recommend to anyone that is becoming kosher or even isn't. The pizza here is amazing and doesn't even taste kosher! But what I really loved is the spaghetti with pesto!!! The flavors are so rich and everything is so fresh!"}
{"text":"I am not a pizza lover by any means, but there pizza is the perfect blend of homemade flavor with restaurant put togetherness

I love their versatility in creating subs to my specific nuanced taste. And the breaded fish sub is great too"}
{"text":"I went to this pizza joint based on a word-of-mouth review from a fellow co-worker (who used to frequent the place years ago). He said that their meatball subs were good and he described it as a \"nice little spot\" that he remembered enjoying.

Looking online for their web site before-hand, I discovered a simple godaddy placeholder page with their logo and address along with a \"coming soon\" notice. Every business out there needs a web site, and it's especially important to put your restaurant menu online, so this should have immediately been a warning sign for what was to come.

When my friends and I arrived at the Manhattan Pizzeria, we were surprised to discover a total absence of sausage or pepperoni options. Apparently, the restaurant has recently been \"koshered\" and now only serves vegetarian options and fish-based meats. This came as quite a surprise, because the name of the restaurant was still the same, and we didn't have any fore-warning from their web site.

We decided to roll with it anyways and give it a chance, ordering a couple of slices of pizza with various vegetarian toppings. One of my friends ordered a sub sandwich that had salmon on it.

As we sat waiting at our table, ten minutes went by, then twenty. Right as we were really starting to get antsy (after waiting for almost a full 30 minutes), they brought our pizza slices and the sandwich out to our table. This struck all of us as a bit of an excessive wait. The place wasn't busy with other customers, and the food we ordered was pretty basic. Any decent pizza joint should have been able to toss the various toppings on their pre-made cheese pizza stock slices, pop them into the oven, and deliver them nice and hot to our table within 15 minutes (at the most). The idea of having to wait a full 30 minutes for this really put a damper on the overall lunch experience.

To top it off, the pizza was mediocre at best, and the salmon sub sandwich was a bit bland.

In summary, if vegetarian (or Kosher) pizza, pasta, and sub sandwiches are what you're after (and the idea of fish meatballs sounds good to you), then this is the place for you! Don't go unless you're willing to wait, though.

Also, I *really* think that the new restaurant owners should have completely renamed the place if they were going to take over and completely change the menu the way that they apparently did. Phoenix is a big place with a lot of people who have no doubt gone to the Manhattan Pizzeria over the years, and if you keep the same name, they are going to expect the same experience and the same types of food that they had in the past. Completely changing the name would have avoided the disappointment of un-met expectations."}
{"text":"My family and I get have been coming here for years. We take out pizza from here at least once a month and are always pleased with the quality and taste. The interior is simple and clean and the owners are friendly. A great Mom and Pop restaurant worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I  shared  two sandwiches. We had the #25 eggplant sub and the #19 caprese sub and tried two slices of cheese pizza.
These were delicious subs on delicious crunchy fresh sesame crusted rolls. We also tried the cheese pizza slices  first and they were the best we've had in Phoenix.  Great location, price and I'm all about supporting local businesses.  I suggest you come try the cheese pizza.    They also have calzones, pasta dinners fresh salads and bagels.
They are vegetarian and have vegan & gluten free options too."}
{"text":"So to be honest I misread the address on this place the first time I wanted to go here thought it was 7th ave not 7th street so I ended up not going that day. However, I did still want to try it, so I went here yesterday after a very long day and got a sandwich #12 with eggplant and 3 types of cheese. It was okay, not as good as I was expecting, but it was still a pretty good sandwich. I'd say about the same as Subway if they served eggplant sandwiches. Its a small place and it took a few minutes to get the sandwich, but it is a hot sandwich, and it is big. They offer a huge selection, and it is decent price, just under $8 after tax. Think it might have been a 15 inch cuz it seemed bigger than a footlong. Either way, the food was good, the lady was nice, and I might go back, if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Manhattan! The food is always fresh and made when we order it. We went in to pick up an order tonight and saw wonderful improvements that they have recently made! New tables and chairs both inside and out and beautiful new floors. In our opinion Manhattan is the best Kosher pizza in town! Yum!"}
{"text":"This place gets THREE-STARS just for being Kosher and it's just alright.  I ordered a veggie calzone here and there isn't really much to say about it.  Nothing spectacular.  The parking lot is very bizarre.  It's definitely worth a shot!  Maybe I'll get something else here next time."}
