{"text":"Excellent food, Fantastic service, Friendly atmosphere. Best hot dog I have EVER had!"}
{"text":"Great service, friendly owners, and awesome food. It's a fun place and I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Great Hot Dogs. Haven't been there in a while, but I am very happy to see that in these hard economic times they are still doing a good business"}
{"text":"We have been here twice already and will definently be back many more times! The food is fantastic! Easily the BEST hot dog I have ever had. The owners are super friendly and even remembered us and our young daughters name. Our new place to eat for sure"}
{"text":"Great food. We always stop by when we visit Goodyear from the midwest. The owners always greet us with smiles and friendly talk.  The chili dog is very good but the deep fried deserts are the best."}
{"text":"Good food but a Lot of it. Bring an appetite. People are nice and the owners work there too which is nice. Except theres this one cook who can be overbearing. other than that, comfortable atmosphere but very pricey. I will only go when there are specials , which I get via txt. And you can too! The number is posted by the cash register. God bless!"}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I stopped by to check it out we didn't expect to leave with new friends, not to mention a full stomach and a new sweet tooth for those fried Oreos!! The variety of things that you can add to your hot dog is just awesome, we never get the same thing twice. We try to come in atleast once a week, well we've been in twice in three days this week. Not only do we go there for the food but Derek and Krisitna are good people. They ALWAYS make us laugh. I can't get over Kristina's sarcasim!! Two genuine people that obviously have an awesome love for eachother and you can see/taste it in their dogs. So if you want to leave with a smile and a full stomach, go see Derek and Kristina, it's a sure thing.  Brit & Justin"}
{"text":"New place in the neighborhood, had to check it out, and glad we did.  We both got Nathan's Polish Dog with spicy mustard and sauerkraut and ordered the cheese fries.  Serving size for the fries is enough for 2 people to share.  The dogs were piping hot and extremely tasty.  Received service with a smile.  Will be going back again."}
{"text":"Can't say that the hot dogs are good - because I enjoyed an Italian Beef Sandwich.  Excellent.  On our next visit will give the dogs a try. Clean establishment with very accommodating owners/operators.  Was surprised how busy it was for a mid-afternon weekday visit."}
{"text":"Great dogs!  1/4 pound Nathan's hotdogs and sausages served in unique variations.  They also serve deep fried treats.  This is a must when driving into or out of Phoenix.  I had the Juaninator and conquered it.  #158.  (forgot to post this from my phone -- we were there 8/30/2012)"}
{"text":"LIving in Chicago for a year and eatting protillos for lunch quite a few times I craved a hot dog joint since I moved to the desert.  I was very happy when I found this place.  Sadly the hours are strange (close on sundays and close for the night at 8) but the owner and staff are very friendly.  I ended up trying the juaninator and never had a hotdog fill me until then.  I must say its not the healthiest of options though.   On that note everything in this place is fried and  I am not sure if they will prepare the hotdog a different way.   The food is fantastic though.  Like i said earlier I order the juaninator and finished (#72) but will probably never order that again, just way too much food LOL.  Looking forward to returning and getting a \"normal\" hotdog."}
{"text":"First time there 4/30/12 I don't eat dogs often, but had a craving yesterday. Arrived around 6:15pm - place was empty - greeted with a hardy Hello! Super clean place, smelled really good..  Said it was my first time there, they explained the ordering process.. very easy, fill in the blank kinda thing..  Never had a deep fried dog, so i just went plain.. 1/4lb , sweet relish..  it was amazing.. cooked perfect.. I expected to get a mouth full of grease.. not even close.. it was the best dog i've ever had, from Philly to Phoenix..  Sweet potato fries!! again.. perfection..  I'll need to go when it is busier to see if it stays consistent..   Mom and Pop shop yes.. friendly, good food, although it cost me $10 for a hot dog, fries, and iced tea.. i left full and satisfied..   Didn't try desserts... yet. -)"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! There really isnt more to say. The chili cheese fries were great, the dogs were perfect and the service was amazing!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat. The food is delicious and the desserts......YUMMERS! I love the owners and their dedication to making you feel welcome. In fact, my husband plans his business trips around a Italian beef sandwich and chili cheese fries. Stop in, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"BEST DOGS AND DESSERTS EVER!!!! I live in Central Phoenix and i would drive everyday to eat there! Service was very friendly and a great place to eat for dinner, especially after a ball game."}
{"text":"The Which-Wich style of Hot-Dog orders, this place packs a solid frank. The sweet potato fries are recommended and the portion is fairly large. At the end of the day, I had trouble paying nearly $10 for a hot dog, fries, and a drink; especially when Costco is right down the road and it's $1.65 for a dog and drink. If I want a Fancy Dog, I'd recommend Short Leash Dogs in Phoenix. Unfortunately, they're not out on the west side!  I plan to go back and try a couple different options."}
{"text":"Oh Ivy League Dogs I'm happy to say my little fam of 3 was won over last night. What we came for wasn't a \"traditional\" hot dog experience but what we got was entirely traditional in spirit. I'll explain... But first the food. The hot dogs are deep fried so the traditional Nathan snappy had a crispy & chewy texture to the dog skin. Very nice! The condiments were perf even the size especially the larger pieces of onion & sport peppers. My hubs prefers the BIG onion flavor & I prefer it subtle so he was happy & I was able to easily remove the pieces of the dice & not lose my spicy mustard in the excess onion purge. We also shared a delicious boat of the chili cheese fries. My son ordered the hot link with cheese & crispy fried bacon chunks (real bacon folks no skimping here) . He couldn't stop eating or smiling & for a 13 year old boy that was a pleasure for a Mom's heart. Mom's of 13 year olds know those smiles are harder to achieve as he's becoming a man. What I came for as much as for the dogs was the sometimes served deep fried rice krispie treat with my choice of 3 sauces that I heard about on their FB page. Man was I stoked! This concoction didn't disappoint it was a crispy fried batter while maintaining a moist texture. The krispie had become a gooey mess of delicious inside. Just can't get over the yum then there's the chocolate sauce & dust of confectioners sugar.  Now the traditional portion of our experience was something from my childhood before the franchise was uber king and that is the family part of the restaurant equation. The pride in being honest hardworking people putting out tasty food & treats. It was everywhere behind the counter to the door. It started with the cheery welcome & instructions on ordering. Then continued when the \"Pop\" of Mom & Pop letting us know that the fries were big enough to share because we had ordered 2 of them (would've been a total waste because the fries are BIG) to the white board that said welcome to our home. The best part is the keen eye with which they watch you & bring your desert after you've finished eating. Loved this place, the food & the family aspect is the cherry on top. Thank you Ivy League Dogs we're customers for as long as your door swings open. Make sure to check the hours or call because the weekend hours are scarce. Definitely a fun week night splurge."}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch this week.  When you walk in the door they greet you with a smile.  The place is nice and clean.  You pick up a small menu and mark with a pencil what you would like and hand it to the cashier.  You have many choices of different kinds of dogs with numerous toppings and add-ons.  Side orders are limited to fries, chips or potato salad.  For dessert you can have a fried Twinkie or Oreo.    The food was very good and the toppings/ add-ons were fresh.    We each had a hot dog with fries and two cokes.  The bill was $13.86.    The Ivy League is worth a visit."}
{"text":"2 words, great dogs! I'll start by saying that they are closed on Sunday because I tried to go there yesterday to the disappointment of stomach.  When I went a few weeks ago I got a bacon dog, chili cheese fries, and deep fried oreos. I didn't eat it all at once because there definitely was enough to share.   The bacon on the hot dog was very crisp, which definitely helped win me over. I hate when I get bacon on anything and it's chewy like jerky. The chili cheese fries were great, unless that's the only thing you're eating you get way more than enough to share.   It was my first time trying deep fried oreos and they didn't win me over. The batter was too bland and doughy for me.  I would recommend Ivy League Dogs to anyone. You get what you pay for, so make sure you come with an empty stomach!"}
{"text":"The hot dogs here are phenomenal! You can get whatever toppings you want. I chose a Nathan's hot dog with my favorite toppings and a side of chili cheese fries (I was so bad). And it was incredible. Let me say this also, the portions are huge. I barely finished my hot dog and was able to share my fries with a friend and we barely polished those off.   Add to this the fact that the owners are incredibly nice. In fact they were so nice that since this was our first visit to Ivy League Dogs we got a free serving of their Deep Fried Oreos. Yep. You heard me right. They deep fried Oreos. And Oh My God were they delicious. They drizzled some caramel on top and I thought I died and went to heaven.   You have to come here and try some. The place has a neighborhood feel, the owners seem to know everyone and have a great sense of humor. On top of that the food is so good. Worth every penny and what a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've stopped by to get a bite to eat. It just keeps getting better and better. The inside of the restaurant is clean and very well decorated. The food is fresh and phenomenal. You get exactly what you order, I ordered good food and I got it! The best part about this place is that it's not just any ole' hotdog joint, you don't get a dinky little dog that barely fits in your bun, you get a elegantly gourmet bratwurst that's filling and delicious. They have nine choices of different dogs. The first time I went there I ordered the mozzarella garlic sausage topped with spicy mustard, onions, sauerkraut, bacon, and shredded cheese on a sesame seed bun. They do give you quite a decent amount of what you order but at least they're not jipping you, and if you don't want as much on your order you can just wright \"light\" next to that topping on your menu. And you have not LIVED until you've tasted deep fried Oreos! A husky guy such as myself cannot resist the temptation of deep fried anything; they also have deep fried Twinkies. If you didn't like Twinkies before you'll love them now! The only complaint I have is that they're not closer to my house. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome dogs, one of a kind.   Ordered a dog with crispy bacon, onions, melted cheese and a side of oh my god potato salad.. it aint a snack, its a whole lunch.  so tasty i still have that after taste after few hours.  im going back next week with and army of friends."}
{"text":"I give one star cause I think it sucks they had to close their doors!   I loved this place.  I know they have been closed for some time now... Sad every time I drive past.   Support your local mom-and-pop-shops and small businesses in YOUR AREA!   Stick IT to MegaCorp and Tasteless Fast Food establishments! Ivy League!  You are MISSED!  So very missed!  ... Moment of silence... Thank you for your oh so yummy and deliciousness while it lasted!"}
{"text":"Custom built hot dogs, what more could you ask for?  Well...how about deep fried Oreo's, Twinkies, and much more!   Family run joint where customer service is tops.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"YOU were the cashier; therefore, I rest my case......."}
{"text":"I don't go here enough, but when I do it's always top notch. Great food, great menu, and great people. The owners are some of the best people I have ever met and I believe that is transferred to their simple but awesome food. High quality people cooking high quality food."}
{"text":"I hate to write about a place I don't care for, others may find it wonderful. But I have to speak up on this place. If you know a real Chicago style hot dog, and that is your standard, this place you should never, and I mean never, step foot in. A deep fried hot dog? Sick. This place does their own thing, and obviously, some folks like it. But Chicago style? No way. Good? That's for you to decide. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I wonder why everyone loves this place. Something has to be wrong with ppl in az when it comes to food.  If you can ever manage to find this place open you will find that they fry your dogs in a fryer. Paid 6 bucks for the veggie dog which was a sausage style which they proceeded to fry until desiccated into dust. Kinda appalled they would fry a vegetarian dog in the same vat with a beef dog. But meh. I don't know how this place stays in business they're not open most of Saturday and they close when ever they like. ALWAYS check their Facebook page before you waste gas because they close whenever they feel like it. Not to mention the price, two ppl with fries and drinks cost almost 20 bucks. For hotdogs!!! I would rather travel to GhettoCenter and eat Hot-on-a-Stick then this rubbish."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this restaurant and it was nothing but positive from my first step in the door.  Everyone was very nice and talked with us several times throughout our meal.  They let us try the Fried Oreo's which were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Super Delicious! Best Burgers everrrrrrrrrrr! You guys never disappoint. Great food and even greater people running it :)"}
{"text":"OK...So I'm pretty much a regular at Ivy League Hot Dogs....  I eat here 1-2 times per month on average...  This is not because I'm a friend or relative... I am a Foodie that loves a delicious meal as much as I love a fantastic eating experience... Ivy League Dogs has both. I feel in love with this place on my first visit....  I mean the food (pretty much only hot dogs and fries along with desserts at that time) was delicious, and the service was FANTASTIC! They are small business owners that strive for repeat business... The service on my first visit was as good as my most recent (13th per Yelp) visit... Their menu has expanded and now serves hearty hamburgers (try a double...or triple..or maybe even Quadzilla if you have the guts...or stomach capacity), Cheesesteaks, Fish and Chips, Italian Beef sandwiches and Fair style desserts. I'm telling you, if they have it, you can get it... There are over 30 topping you can customize your hot dogs, burgers or even you cheesesteak with to \"make it your own\"... When I go out to eat with my family, every dollar counts and more important, the experience itself counts.... This place has delicious food, huge portions, very reasonable pricing and customer service that is 2nd to none!!! I urge everyone close by, or passing by to try them.... Heck, even if your not close by, take the trip. ** Pay attention to their hours of operation as they are closed on Sundays and only open until 2pm on Saturdays **"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. The place is clean and service is great. Hot dogs are large and fries portions are huge. My wife and I share a small order most of the time."}
{"text":"A great little YELP find off the I-10 freeway.  Part owner (and fulltime pet) IVY, it a Pug doggie with attitude.  She has her owners working the shop with quick smiles and friendly service.  The check-off list menu is fun and adds a little twist to the simple hotdog order.  The DOGS were amazing... it don't get better than this... each bite gave a tantalizing hint of what was to come on a fully loaded dog.  A little bit pricy... but well worth the cash.  Four Barks easy... eh, make that Four Stars!  Where the mustard?"}
{"text":"Finally there's a hot dog place here that can compare to hot dog places I've seen on the travel channel and food network.  I had the Juaninator and it was delicious.  I love this place.  The fried oreos were the bomb!  Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened because its super close to my work and Derek and Kristina have become like family to us here in the office. Their food is always delicious and i am never disappointed with anything they serve there. I have had everything from the hot dogs to the beef sandwich to now the burger and let me tell you! Their burgers are the best I've ever had! And the price is better then I've paid for a gourmet burger like that! Anyone that says they don't like this place is a crazy person!! I love you Ivy League!!!! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Going back asap!!!  The owners are crazy friendly and hilarious.  Good place to go relax maybe watch a few games and laugh with good friends."}
{"text":"We read about this place in the Az Republic and thought we would give it a try, the owners being strong Christians gave us a lot of confidence in the visit. When we arrived we found the place to be spotless, a very good sign of the owners caring about the business. All the people working are very friendly and attentive to the customer needs. We have now been in four times and thoroughly enjoyed each and every visit. The dogs are fantastic and you get them the way you want, not like some corporation wants to serve them. Kudos to the owners and the employees, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Great place!!! We were greeted and treated so well, they even threw in a free dessert cuz it was our first time there.  Our hot dogs were outstanding! I had one kinda Chicago style.  I cant wait to go back and try more options.  We had two hot dogs, fries and a drink under $13."}
{"text":"Not so thrilled about having \"fried\" hot dogs, prefer them to be grilled, but food was still very good!!   Nice family-owned, cozy, joint with GREAT service!!  Will definetely visit again when in the area!!"}
{"text":"Nice little hidden place!  excellent food and the owners were very nice to us.  Deep fried Oreo's, all beef hotdogs made to order, and my favorite chicago peppers!  we will be back!  and as for the redhead child in the complaint above, I, too stared at the abomination...forecfully restraining myself form \"kicking the Ginger....\" try this place, you'll love it and the prices are very reasonable.  Beware redheads at all costs... R"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs, but this place is pretty cool. The do have sausage and brats in addition to dogs and everything is deep fried. Definitely enjoyed my meal here and love the customer card that lets you buy 10 dogs get one free."}
{"text":"My review is a bit tardy and for that, I apologize.   So, my first thought was, \"What the heck is so great about hot dogs? I mean, they're hot dogs for crying out loud.\" I am here today to admit I was very wrong.   Ivy League Dogs has the BEST hot dogs I have ever had. Oh. My. God. I had a chili cheese dog with onions. It was fantastic. The only thing I would do different is ask for more chili and less onions next time, but that was my bad. The service was friendly. The place is very clean. The food is delicious. I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful establishment! The owners are very friendly and enthusiastic, and they have created an atmosphere that you will defimately want to come back to. I had the  polish dog with chili and bacon on a sesame seed bun.it was huge! Good prices as well."}
{"text":"This is a great chili dog / Chicago style dog made in tasty fashion. They had some people in there complaining that it took too long even though they don't start to make it till you order it. I had chili fries as well and everything tasted great and was as ordered. They are open longer hours now and seem to be listening to the reviews ( also seem to be bringing in a full time manager) Anyone who says they don't have good hotdogs here doesn't like hotdogs in my opinion. Worth the try, not an everyday place for me or my diet."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I'm a repeat customer and have tried everything from the hot dogs to the beef sandwich and I haven't had one bad thing yet. I brought my wife to try it and she loves it too. The staff/owners are super friendly and the place is very kid friendly as well. My 4 year old loves the \"hot dog restaurant.\" You get to pick whatever toppings you want so I don't know how you can complain about them. I read the one bad review on here and I don't know what he's talking about...I've only ever had excellent customer service in there."}
{"text":"Great - yummy - guilty pleasure hot dogs.  I had the chili dog with crispy onions - that is rights - crisy onions.  The fries were old school crinkle cut - also very tasty.  The best part is the owners make you feel like family when you come in.    I will be back for my next guilty pleasure!"}
{"text":"This place is Awesome! The couple who run Ivy League are Very Friendly and the dogs (and sandwiches) are great. I take my girlfriend and freinds here on a regular and not once have we been disappointed.            They use big quarter pound hot dogs and douse them with delicious toppings. They also offer brats, variety of sausages, fish and chips and my favorite menu item the italian beef sandwich (I highly recommend adding the spicey peppers). Another one of my favorites is the chimichanga dog. They wrap a hot dog in a tortilla and deep fry it. They then top it with red and green salsa and sour cream (Amazing!).           Don't go too over board though because you're going to want to save room for desert. They have a variety of deep fried treats including the must-order deep fried oreos! Oreos dipped in batter, deep fried to perfection and drizzled with your choice of chocolate or raspberry sauces."}
{"text":"Obviously these people are not from any ivy league state. They wouldn't know a hotdog if it bit them in their buns.  Hot dogs are deep fried. Onions are size of   Chicklettes and peppers come uncooked and whole. Who the hell serves a hotdog with a whole pepper? Go to a baseball game and see how a hotdog is supposed to be served lady.  Avoid this place at all costs! Poor customer service.   Also, thanks for walking away when I was asking you about the peppers lady!  This is from the guy with the red headed baby you were gawking at. Have a great day!"}
{"text":"They have burgers and home-made donuts now! Woooohoooo!!! This place has become a family tradition on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Great tasting hot dogs but not a place to be if you're trying to stay healthy."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars, straight up.  They use fried Nathan's dogs, which aren't my favorites, however....... They make up for this one little hiccup with incredible service and loads of toppings.  My 1/4 pound hot dog must have weighed close to two pounds once it was constructed.  And talk about customer service!!!!  The owners take the time to refer to you by name, are always checking to make sure your food is made correctly to your order, and they bring the food to your table if they are not overly swamped with customers.  Oh, and they have deep fried twinkies and oreo's for dessert.  Fatteningly decadent.  It's like the state fair, but at less than half the price.  I ate there around 5 p.m. and was still full at 9:30 p.m.  Ridiculously good."}
{"text":"Been back there a couple of times since the initial visit and review (Jul '10). Decided to submit some additional comments. This place just keeps getting better. Dog, fries, and other items on the menu are better than ever. The staff (owners/RN) are very awesome people and super friendly. Even gave us some free desert to try. We will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"The owners here make the restaurant worth visiting. Food taste amazing, and my family as whole is grateful for everything the owners have done for my family after the passing of one of our family members. DID I MENTION THE FOOD IS GREAT!"}
