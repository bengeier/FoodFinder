{"text":"Good value. Ordered the pho noodle soup special and the portion was fairly large (+drink) for the price. 

Service was good. 

No complaints."}
{"text":"Too much MSG caused me thirsty and mouth dried after meal"}
{"text":"The owner of Hachitaro Japanese (East of Hwy 7 and McCowan) is now the owner of Big Head Prawn. He sat us down into the booth.

I had the lunch special: raw beef noodle soup and curry beef brisket on rice with a side of spring roll. 

My raw beef noodle soup was not raw. I had a couple spoonfuls of the soup and it was warm/cold. The soup was not hot and there was no steam coming from the bowl of noodle. 

The beef brisket on rice was warm-cold too. The beef brisket was a little tough and difficult to chew.

I ended up not finishing either dishes. I did not pack it in a doggy bag either. It was not good. As I left I suddenly got very thirsty - main side effect of MSG. I cannot stand MSG and somehow it did not function well with the food as it did not taste good. FYI MSG makes food tastes a lot better than they actually do. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is so bad. We were a table of about 15 and not a single person in our group was satisfied with the food. I had the bun bo hue and it was the worst tasting one I've ever had in my life. Few others ordered pho and the soup was only luke warm and not hot enough to cook the beef. Went once and never going back. Only positive thing was the avocado milkshake 5 of us ordered, that tasted good."}
{"text":"Have not tried the pho, but I have been twice and had the dry vermicelli lunch specials both times.  They were great both times. The cold lemon tea, that comes with the lunch special, is great too. For $6.99, at lunch, it is a good deal. My husband had the lemongrass pork chop on rice. He said that was ok too.
Not willing to try the Pho because of past reviews and my favourite place is Kim Po for Pho."}
{"text":"Went here on Saturday at around 4pm just in time for their afternoon tea special.
There was 1 other table of people, Food was ok, nothing special.
The reason I'm giving this place 1 star is because it was like in the high 20's outside and they didn't have AC on..........
Don't know if it was broken or if they turned it off cause lack of business.
Was covered in sweat and couldn't wait to pay the bill and leave.
I won't be returning to this place.
Like the poster above mentioned - very poor choice of location."}
{"text":"It is so close to my house that I have to try it.  I ordered the regular Pho.  The usual MSG taste, but I have tasted better.  It is okay for a quick fix me up lunch, but I won't come here for dinner."}
{"text":"Nope.

I ordered a satay beef noodle soup, all I got was a regular beef broth plus the fact it's very spicy. I didn't feel any satay at all. My dad had the spicy beef vermicelli, similar comment.

We also ordered the pork roll wrapped in rice paper. It's okay, but we've had better in places like Kim Po and Top Saigon.

The iced lemon tea was good though, but aside from that I'm not coming back.

PS: Poor location by transit and automobile as it took me a good 5 minutes to turn back onto Hwy 7."}
{"text":"Afternoon tea 2:30-5:30 is such a deal! $3.99 for a drink and pho is a steal, especially since the food quality is quite good too. I always go here and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"No More Chicken Wings and Leafs Games?

Pho and Chinese TV shows are in?

This old Puck'N Wings' location is now replaced by Big Head Prawn, a New Vietnamese restaurant!

The deco and set up is so familiar... Photos of Vietnamese food replaced those of hockey and basketball players.... The booth seats are still as tight as before, but at least I won't OD on beer and wings here and have a \"beer\" belly.

The waiter here is so eager to help and make suggestions even before I got a chance to look at the menu. The menu looks really similar to Kim Po's.

Special Pho Small ($6.50)
- Really nice fragrant soup based and have great depth
- Broth is so hot which I do prefer as the bean sprout are all cooked well after soaking in the broth
- Meat are of good cut
- Noodles though not fresh but cooked probably and have great bite

10% off for Grand Opening Specials. No lunch set but do have afternoon tea set available.

I guess I need to come back to try different items on the menu."}
