{"text":"Bills has the best breakfast.   Ask for their hash browns and beacon.  Don't understand why the most simplistic meal is so much better here and don't need to. Eggs always perfect,  service is like being at an aunts house."}
{"text":"breakfast tastes better than my grandmas . lunch is amazing too. love coming here, especially being from the westside i don't know much over here. phenomenal"}
{"text":"Love this place, unfortunately when management is there I don't wanna order anything , let alone dine in . They're rude and never have a full menu(constantly running out of things). I love the cooks and the servers but management needs a different approach on customer service ."}
{"text":"I love the unpretentious, mom and pop vibe of this place and the low prices. The only downside is this is a CASH ONLY restaurant. Totally worth it.  The helpings are a good size,  everything is homemade  (no boxed or frozen home fries for THIS gal) and the most expensive item on the menu is the $6.95 steak, eggs and toast. They have lunch items as well,  the most expensive sandwiches being the $6.50 corned beef and the Reuben. And I never had grits before I came to Bill's, but I strongly recommend you get them  (with brown sugar on the side). Just an FYI, this place is FAR from fancy. It's not the kind of place you bring someone on a date,  more like the kind of place you bring someone the morning after an especially good date!  ;)

EDIT: It's official. I'm addicted to their grits. I never had a bowl of grits before coming to Bill's, but so help me I must have some whenever I visit them."}
{"text":"There are little, magic places that you find in corners of the world that make you happy; Bill's is one of those places for me. 

Bill's sits in a tiny strip on Mayfield road in Cleveland Heights and has been there for YEARS. It used to be that the owners had hundreds of polaroid photos on the walls of happy customers, the owners taking pride in the smiles of their customers. They still have those, but they're in a rolodex-type deal up front, and in the back, the couple who owns the place has a shrine to their kids and grandkids. It's really nice.

Now, to the reason for the review; The food is inexpensive, well done, and plentiful. Breakfast, lunch and a nice snack can be had at Bill's for the leaner budget, and the staff are nice folks. Coffee always filled and you really feel waited on well. 

The place is a little beat up, but they've been in business for many years, and the wear and tear just shows they've been doing it well and tasty for many a day. 

There's lots of parking out back and the only thing I'm sorry for is that they're not open longer (I think their hours are 7 to about 2 pm.) 

So, if you want a tasty snack that good for your appetite AND your wallet, check out Bill's, and say \"hi\" to Bill for me:)"}
{"text":"Not a bad little coffee shop and diner in Cleveland Heights.  I'm not sure how long Bill's has been there, but based upon the decor and the snapshots lining the walls, it's been a while.  Great value and the service has always been friendly."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE service. Waited at least 45 minutes, and they had not even started making our breakfast! Ended up leaving."}
{"text":"This place really puts the grease in greasy spoon. I sat down at the counter amidst dirty plates  to my right and left, all of which sat there for the entire duration of my visit.  The waitress seemed to move in slow motion and only bussed the dirty dishes when another customer finally sat down at the counter. She would leave dirty dishes in various places all over the restaurant. It wasn't good. The prices are low here but I guess one gets what one pays for. My \"over easy\" eggs had hard yolks. And it took a good 25 minutes to make my breakfast, so I think the issues are shared equally by front of house and back of house."}
{"text":"This place is granted 2 stars because they cook their food and buy local.  The customer service is awful. I went there on Thursday September 8, 2016 at 8:35 AM and ordered a cheese omelet for carry out. At 8:48 the waitress (bow legged) older woman began arguing with the cook in front of all the patrons. Then she burned the toast she was preparing and had to do it over. In the mean time several patrons were waiting, another one said \" I'm good, cancel my order\". It's now 8:53 I wish I could do the same but they made me pay upfront. 8:59 I finally get my order 24 minutes unacceptable especially after having to hear that silly argument that was totally unprofessional."}
{"text":"Let me just say, I want to love this place, I really do! But...it's really quite underwhelming. Have dined here twice, once for lunch/once for breakfast. The lunch was great. Breakfast just stunk. My over medium eggs had runny whites and the sausage side was burned. Painful trying to flag down the waitress who seemed interested in chatting up the regulars than assisting us. It's cheap, but it's not worth it. Better off going down the road to Eat at Joe's: better quality control and waitresses. Shame I don't like this place, it's so close to my house."}
