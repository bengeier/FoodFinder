{"text":"Hands down, one of the worst meals of our lives!  If a zero rating was permitted, we would have chosen it.

* calamari, after scraping away a pound of breading (with Old Bay Seasoning, maybe?) on each piece to make sure we accidentally did not order the cheese sticks, popcorn,shrimp or chicken tenders, we'll concede that the squid inside was tender

* the salad looked like it was retrieved from someone's compost pile ... yikes, I did eat it after picking out the yellow, brown, and forest green slimy pieces

* wedding soup sure to break up any happy marriage - the only thing that added substance to it were the two saltine crackers that were added to it - pre-crumbled crackers, that is

* steps to make the handmade beef ravioli
1. add \"beef\" and some liquid (any will do) to a blender and puree thoroughly to achieve a thin baby food paste
2. lather grey \"beef\" paste over quarter inch thick sheet of \"pasta\" and top with another quarter inch thick sheet of \"pasta\"
3. place into pierogi mold and press
4. boil
5. top with copious amounts of prego-ish sauce, making sure to completely cover the ravioli so the dish resembles thick bowl of tomato stew
6. serve to customer with a quick gesture to ensure to knock the salad and appetizer dish out of the way

* okay, this is good. One guest asked what comes on the italian hoagie and the server answered \"nothing.\" When explaining that the type of meats, cheeses, etc where on the sandwich, the server was surprised and said that most people asked about the side dishes of which there are none

* the dense spongey dinner roll was left for the next table to enjoy

* also, the house made pickle was left to languish on the plate

* service and atmosphere - should have taken a nap"}
{"text":"Wow, this I can't believe this place is still open. I went there with my family during the recent holidays. One waitress was extremely rude and the other sweet, but acted as if she had never been in a restaurant before, let alone waited on an table. The food was awful...AWFUL. I could have made a better meal at home with peanut butter and jelly. One family members dish was supposed to have olive oil as the base and clearly the cook confused that bottle with the vinegar. Really? Really! It was like a bad movie where maybe the real cook had a hot date and had is roomie who can barely make a bowl of cereal fill in for him at work. The worst part was we each spent around $70-$80 per couple - no alcohal - just food. Never again. Blah!"}
{"text":"I went here with some co-workers yesterday.  I must admit that I wanted to try something different here, but then again the Spinach Crab Paradisio I had last time was so yummy, I just had to have it again!  Note to Chicago Yelp'er Mike O, yes I did watch my carbs the rest of the day!"}
