{"text":"This cute little cafe has the best food and service. Every dish I have ever gotten has been exceptional! Food always comes out fast and the waitresses are always so friendly."}
{"text":"We have ordered take out food about 5 times from this place, because we own a business nearby, and we like to support small businesses.  The sandwiches are very plain and predictable (but ok). Hint: Don't order a to go drink, as they charge you full price and give you a dinky coffee cup for your drink ordered.  
In addition to sandwiches, we ordered a bowl of soup with our last order.  I one block back to our shop and unpacked the lunches.  The soup had inedible chunks of flour throughout, was cold and just plain awful.  After eating our sandwiches (which were adequate), I drove back to Dessie's to tell them that the soup was \"problematic\".  I gave the waitress back the entire container of soup and told her of the inedible lumps in the soup.  She began arguing with me, saying she had eaten the soup for lunch and there was nothing wrong with the soup.  She then took it back to the kitchen, and came back out, saying it was chunks of unmelted cheese, and not flour in the soup. Either way (whether flour of dried out cold cheese) it was not edible, and I wanted Dessie's to know.  The waitress continued to argue with me, in front of other lunch guests.  I turned around and left them with the soup container without further comment.
  Here is my point....  Had the waitress just apologized, or offered me a new container of another type of soup, or offered me an alternative menu item, or a refund, or anything, I would not be writing this review. When a customer takes the time to drive all the way back to report a problem, the last thing you should do is stand there and argue with them.  REALLY!
I will never eat there again.  Period."}
{"text":"Great traditional breakfasts (over-medium eggs and toast) and and some of the best pancakes I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know how this place has such high reviews. The place was practically empty when we arrived. The food all tasted premade, canned, or boxed. Nothing about the food tasted fresh or made from scratch. Even the coffee tasted like old office coffee. I went here about 2 years ago and I still remember how awful it was. Maybe it has improved since then, but I can still remember the terrible experience."}
{"text":"We love Dessie's! Small, home-style atmosphere without being over the top country.  Great food, reasonable price, and the service makes you feel like you are at your aunt's house. I'm vegetarian and my wife is close to it; we have never had a problem with special orders being fulfilled; Dessie's is quickly becoming our weekend brunch spot of choice."}
{"text":"Very good little place. Took my 12 year old son here for breakfast and the service was excellent.  The food was typical diner type, but the home fries were AWESOME! Great combo of burnt and well cooked pieces. 
We both want to come back next week!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast for sure!! Buuuut the service. Omg. Terrible!! Asked 2 times for a straw, water, a spoon and fork were dirty, one of the servers petted a dog and idk if she washed her hands... Then what blew my mind was a server has a cut on their finger and blood was exposed!! Will not be going back and would not tell somebody to visit."}
{"text":"Great place, awesome service, and excellent food. From Vicki to Alex and Sean, everything is quality and they also throw in great guest service. If your on this side of town or looking for a mom and pop place to eat a great meal, this is your place."}
{"text":"Potato salad was good,as was the BLT. Got there with time to spare before they closed,but felt rushed when the owner, or cook or whoever it was from in back sat at a table and watched me eat. I decided a go box was in order. Very uncomfortable. Pricey too."}
{"text":"Tried Dessie's for the first time today and was really happy I stopped in!! Very friendly, professional service and great food. I got the Mexican omelet which was stuffed with chorizo, pepperjack cheese and covered with tasty adobo sauce. My bf got the Angie's green chile omelet which I tasted and was very good, too. Loved that the hash browns were crispy and not too greasy.  Also love the fact that they have a variety of flavors of individual coffee creamers on the table - nice touch! Overall, a nice little breakfast joint; will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, almost hate to do this but I've eaten here many times. The cook seems to have a real attitude. The wait staff are very pleasant as is the owner and his family. Today, I found crushed egg shells in my German pancake and the cooks response was: \" there's a lot of eggs that go into them so that will happen\". Not the reply I was expecting. This , unfortunately , was not the first time that I found something\" other than\"in my food. The last time it was hair. I doubt I'll be returning anymore."}
{"text":"I waited at least a month after Dessie's opened - I thought they would work out kinks etc.  So I went on a Sunday morning.

I walked in the ambiance seemed very nice - typical breakfast place, cute.  The first thing I noticed was people waiting (which was okay) but many un-cleared tables - I understand that when people leave it takes a few minutes, but some of these table were still un-cleaned after 5 minutes.  So far not a very good start.

We were finally seated, I ordered a very simple breakfast - eggs - over medium, ham and hash browns - sourdough toast and a small juice.

My friend ordered chicken fired steak w/gravy, scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast. He specifically asked that the hash browns be crispy.

We waited a reasonable amount of time and they brought the food.  My eggs were not even close to being medium, extremely runny.  They put the hash browns on the wrong plates - (we switched them ourselves - agin not biggie)

Here's the part that gives this the lowest review.  The Hash Browns were compeltely tasteless, The ham was way too think and undercooked - IO opened the packet of strawberry preserves and ti had separated and had a brownish ring around the package.  Not to mention the previously mention runny eggs.  I also had to ask for the orange juice - something that should have come before the meal.

My friends' scrambled eggs were cold.  The chicken fried steak was over an inch thick - any one who has ever had chicken fried steak knows that anything over a 1/4 inch think is just too much.  Not only was it way to thick but it was tough - he really needed a sharp steak knife.  

They do have a discount for over 60 10% off, but $23 (with the discount was way too much for mediocre food - at best)  

Go around the corner to Bongo's - same shopping center - their breakfasts are huge and prices are better and the food is extraordinary - even the most complicated requests are followed perfectly ( eggs over medium - are actually done medium) and soo delicious.

I would think twice about eating here, unless mediocre is what you like.  I personally will not go back.

I saw people with kids, but as I did not come with any kids - it is hard for me to review if it is kid-friendly"}
{"text":"Nice little spot for breakfast. NOT FOR PARTIES WITH OVER 4 PEOPLE! the food was pretty good and the prices are cheap. Most of of the food had a frozen taste though. I would go back occasionally."}
{"text":"Very Good breakfast. Service was great. Note we did go at 1pm well after morning rush. We enjoyed our food very much."}
{"text":"Several years ago on Mom's Day we had a terrible customer service moment. I wrote the owner never to hear a word. Hadn't gone back since although walking distance from home. 
  
Today thought what the heck we will go up, order and take home. This time not rude, but just disorganized, no thought on true customer service, & order was wrong. Clearly 1 employee was not happy (not at us).  Food is ok & wish the order had been correct, but no point saying anything based on lack of response from owner previously. Popular place, but we don't have many like it close by. Customer centered competition would probably break this place. I'm a business owner as well & customer service is #1 even if you can't do something they want. Handle it with respect. Have a smile on your face (or get another job elsewhere). I think small business success is great, but really sad that after so many years nothing has changed! It starts with the owner."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast! Can't beat the hash browns - perfect! Eggs over easy weren't greasy either! Great service too. Would go back again"}
{"text":"Not too shabby! We've been there a few times. Seems as though they may have had an issue with the cook not paying attention once or twice to the special requests that had been written on our orders, but the friendly server always takes good care of us. 

Very reasonable prices, simple menu and very close to home."}
{"text":"Great service! I had the German pancake it was delicious. Outside is a large dog friendly patio.  I was worried because of other reviews- but took a chance cause I had a taste for a German Pancake - but everything was perfect."}
{"text":"It's an awkward place, the tables are too close together and the decor is very unattractive. The staff could use some training especially in the food handling area. The hostess was coughing excessively into her hands and then without hesitation grabbed our menus and silverware with those same hands. There was some young man that walked around in circles with his hands in his pockets and then grabbed our water glasses way up by the rim to refill them.

The food was average, everyone seemed nice but I just couldn't get over the lack of basic understanding of food handling principles."}
{"text":"We have been going to Dessie's every weekend for the last couple years. Great place to bike to since it's close to our house. My 11 yr. old daughter absolutely loves their pancakes and bacon. They have a great menu with very reasonable prices. However, their food and ambiance is just a small part of what makes this place so great! How many restaurants do you think would remember it's your 11 yr. old's Birthday and have a gift ready for her when she walks in the door?! And if that isn't thoughtful enough, the cards that were all hand written and signed by the servers with the most unbelievably sweet messages were unforgettable! Dessie's has delicious food but most of all they hire truly wonderful people who genuinely care about their customers way beyond how they like their eggs cooked! Thanks to these amazing employees, my daughter will never forget how they made her feel and either will I! With much appreciation and a satisfied tummy!"}
{"text":"Appears they edit Facebook reviews. So much for playing fair. I was honest and will be here as well. 

Had breakfast a few weeks ago. Not unhappy but not overly impressed either. I was expecting a bit more perhaps? The food was no better or worse than some of the name locations in larger stores. Kinda sad really as they could be something different. 

Food was served hot, yet had no real redeeming qualities to it. Same old things you'd find elsewhere: hash browns were cooked but dry and had no real taste. Seems seasoning is not in their ways. Eggs on the benny were ok, a bit over cooked, but I'm\"m good with that. The Hollandaise was most likely canned or a mix. (I cooked for years and I know how to make it correctly) and did the job. Again nothing special. In short the food was ok, albeit bland. Not exactly a calling card restaurant. 

The staff is very young and a bit too childish for a good presentation. Every table being referred to as \"you guys\" and verbiage of \"like\" added to about every sentence might be ok for the 20 something bar scene but it's not in a good restaurant. I support the notion of teen labor and all (I was one) but professionalism is part of what a customer pays for  and this place really lacks that. 

I give it three stars as \"average\". I can think of many other places I'd go first but I do wish to support the small mom and pot stores also. That being said; mom and pop need to step up their game or we'll patronize the other places."}
{"text":"Normally if I have a bad experience at a restaurant I just never go back. Rarely do I write a review. However, after my experience at Dessie's, I feel I need to warn you. When you first walk in, it looks like a quaint Ma and Pa family establishment. Unfortunately, that is not the case. 

While reading our menus, we could hear heavy metal music with explicit, provocative language in the background. Not good since we were with a four-year old toddler. The cook had short hair, but a really long beard that wasn't covered with a net. The breakfast was nothing to brag about. Simple bacon and eggs but cost more than most places. The coffee was lukewarm - add cream and it turns cold. 

Not too bad so far, until my daughter gets her biscuits and gravy. The sausage in the gravy was very undercooked, it was still pink! We showed our waitress (tall, lean older woman with a raspy voice) who asked my daughter if she would like a sausage patty. Wait? What?! Seriously, a sausage patty?!  My daughter said no so the waitress told her to \"just pick out the sausage.\" Then, to top it off, we were charged for her meal! Whatever, we'll pay what we owe. But when the waitress wouldn't accept my Restaurant.com certificate, after I validated it on my iPhone, I just about lost my temper. But I paid my bill in full and left, never to return again. 

If you want a yummy, inexpensive breakfast, drive a few miles southwest and go to Wanda's on Chandler Blvd and Beck. Their biscuits and gravy are the best!"}
{"text":"So looking for a \"pet-friendly\" place, that we could take our puppybutt to... Came across this place. We have never dined here, so we took a chance. Very cute little breakfast/brunch shop, that has a boutiquey, quaint little charm to it. We dined outside so our lil boy could hang out with us. I had the breakfast omelette special, with a hollandaise sauce on the side. One of my daughters had the French toast and my other child had the biscuits & gravy combo. My daughter's French toast was good, nothing too fancy, but still devoured lol. The omelette was delicious, with mushrooms, Swiss cheese and ham. Their home fries were much better than I thought they would be (been to a few places and you never know what to expect when you hear \"home fries\"). The biscuits & gravy were lukewarm, so we mentioned it, and the waitress was on point. She brought my daughter a cup of warm gravy right away and she was jazzed.  We liked the special touch of the cute water bowl our waitress brought for dog. Only thing I would mention to the waiter next time is doggies don't need super iced water lol.  We would come back again! Glad to have found a decent breakfast place, with a bonus, pet-friendly too!"}
{"text":"Another breakfast place I hadn't tried on Ray!  I am glad they added an \"Open\" sign on the reflective sun screening on the windows.  It was hard to tell if the place was actually serving people or not as you drive by so I had skipped stopping in a few times before I tired it.  The place is a bit like a \"Momma's Family\" episode as I think they lifted the design from the set.  Our waitress was exceptionally nice and recommended the German Style Pancakes. I am pretty sure I have never had one before, but it's way different than the normal pancakes served for breakfast. It's a cross between a soufflé, pancake, and crepe.  It's delicious and you don't feel like you have eaten way too much after downing it all with your coffee.  I recommend stopping by and trying one.

Try:

- German Pancakes"}
{"text":"Restaurant unfortunately is closed due to non payment of lease per letter on front door. Very sad since it was a great place to eat and sorry for the employees that worked there !"}
{"text":"So this is a good place to come for \"the morning after\"... for the weekend resurrection breakfast. It's in the neighborhood so for me it starts with a walk. Weekend breakfasts may require a bit of a wait if you come at primetime - as others usually have the same idea (imagine that). But it's a nice alternative to Denny's - more neighborhood feel and clientele a notch classier. I get the coffee - just a regular cuppa joe, nothing fancy. But that's what's needed to start the resurrection process. Friend I usually come with is usually in the same condition. Last time we came he spilled his orange juice all over the table. Tsk tsk. \"Always start with the coffee,\" I told him. The staff was quick to clean things up so we were grateful for that. So anyway I've had omelettes before and this time I had the Eggs Benedict. It definitely hit the spot for me. I actually prefer the Eggs Benedict because you get less overall starch if you substitute something else for the hash browns. That way the bloated/stuffed/full feeling doesn't linger the rest of the afternoon. Sometimes service takes a while - especially when the place is crowded so bring your patience with you or come when you're not in a hurry to get somewhere else after your meal. Place is in the mall with Albertson's, Nosh, Tott's, Starbucks, and Spices. It's right next door to Spices. It's in the Albertson's mall Northwest corner of Ray and McClintock so plenty of parking. Open for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if possible. This review was a long time coming. My first visit there, I decided to order take out. The waitress, who was obviously inexperienced, ran my credit card for a bill totaling around $20. Nothing major. Definitely cheap prices, but quality of food reflects those prices. The problem is, she entered a wrong number and ran my card for ~$820. Apparently she \"hit the wrong buttons\". Let me tell you, that meal is not worth $800! So, I had to spend the entire day battling with these people to do the steps the bank needed to correct it THAT day. They expected me to wait a week for the problem to \"resolve itself\". I'm sorry, but an $800 screw up needs to be taken care of the MOMENT it happens. Not a \"it will resolve itself\" thing. I was given a half-hearted apology, and that is it.

Despite that, I said I would give this place a second shot, using CASH only. Everyone screws up and I am sure they were frustrated as well. Second visit was also take out. Meal was just as inexpensive. The food was terrible. Tasted cheap, but the worst part was how they handled the second screw up. They gave me the correct number of boxes of food, however, in one box was an omelette, the other was the side. They completely forgot an entree that I had paid for! I called them up and was met with a \"I know I gave it to you\" answer. After a lengthy battle (I even offered a picture) and terrible customer service, they said to come back and they would give me the other meal. It was horribly made, burnt, and obvious they did not care about the customer.

Who I would assume is the owner came out to give me my food, was extremely rude, and offered me a \"10% off your next food purchase\" card. Needless to say, it'll never be used.

My experience is rude service, terrible food, and consistent screw ups. If this place at least accepted blame in their problems, I could've given them a better score, but instead, they insisted that these were MY problems and that I would have to deal with them. Ultimately, it is not about the customer. For less I've had offers of free meals (that I've declined) from quality places. It's not about getting the free meal though. It's about accepting blame and being sincere in your apology when you screw up. This place had NO ability to do so.

I am still in shock over how they treated these issues and I was lucky to have a BANK that was willing to get their error corrected right away. I still had a second charge (they ran the card a second time for the correct amount and THEN told me they screwed up the first time) from them, so they got their money for that meal. I ensured I retained all information on that in case they ever deny it being a false charge and try to steal the money from me. I wouldn't put it past a place like that.

My recommendations: Go somewhere else. However, if you are looking forward to trying this place, bring cash and don't expect much."}
{"text":"I've been here at least 10 times ... I like it ... but its not my favorite.  I always get the spanish omelette egg whites without chorizo because I don't eat meat.  Once the chef forgot and put it in and I could hear him swearing from my table when he had to remake it.  The wait staff are all very friendly, but seem a bit overwhelmed keeping up with drink refills. Once my omelette came out scrambled instead of an omelette because the chef says its too hard to make an omelette out of egg whites ... which I've gotten the other 9 times.  They are a mom and pop restaurant and I sometimes think they feel like it's ok to do it there way rather then the customers way.

All in all though, with the exception of those 2 times, the food has always been great - they grill their english muffins on the griddle and let me tell you - those are awesome!"}
{"text":"Was a bit skeptical based on previous reviews however decided to give it a try and am glad I did.  Had breakfast there and was pleasantly surprised .  Eggs cooked perfectly...not brown and dry as most places in the valley.  Very accommodating with substitutions and even decaf coffee as good. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"The picture for the German pancake  at Dessie's Cafe does not do it any justice. My pancake was was limp and had too much butter for my liking. It was also not as large as I'm accustom to.I have had better ones at the Village Inn. My wife had a breakfast burrito without meat. She substituted spinach. She enjoyed it very much. Not overly busy for a Saturday morning. If I were in the neighborhood again I would go back but I wouldn't make a special trip like I would to any of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Nice local cafe - with many locals that go there on a regular basis. 
My bestie has a gluten intolerance, and they assured her that they cleaned off their one grill just to make her meal - and asked her different questions to make sure that they were getting her ingredients that fit her needs.  The cook even came out to our table after food was served and asked if she got everything she needed and sympathized to her food needs.  That service is unheard of.
I got the green chili omelet with chicken and it was good. 
Would go back any day - with knowing it is a local neighborhood cafe."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here and the service is the best.  If you want an affordable, home cooked meal served by a friendly staff that remembers your face time after time Dessie's is the place for you!"}
{"text":"We come here for breakfast regularly and are never disappointed. Service is ok, some times better than others but food is always great and well priced."}
{"text":"It's hard to review the food since I never had a chance to order it.   The cafe is marketed on grub hub as offering delivery- when I called they said they don't offer delivery.  So I then asked to do a \"to go\" order-- I was placed on hold for 50 minutes.  Since I was at home, sick, I decided to keep the line open and just wait, and the total length of the hold was over 50 min.  Hung up and called back, it went to a voicemail box that's full.  I guess that's to be expected for small business, but still, if a to-go order cannot be accommodated it would've been better just to say so.  Luckily there are other breakfast places that also don't offer delivery, but DO offer better customer service."}
{"text":"My family and I went to  Dessie Cafe in
Chandler, sure was a terrific brunch. 
The food was super and the people 
working there were all very nice ---
GREAT MEAL"}
{"text":"I like it. I went for lunch and had a BLT. I thought the bread would be toasted (oops minus a star) and it wasn't but it was nice and fresh, the bacon was thick and crispy. The food was good and I timed it, 7 minutes from order to table...not bad in fact that's good in my book.  Breakfast is served all day, so no need to hurry just get there before they close at 2:30. I see they are on facebook and they need friends so everyone \"Like it\" please

Real food, good portions and reasonable prices. BLT $4.99 with side. 1/2 lb hamburger with FF made fresh 5.99. (real fresh cut French fries which they don 't even say on the menu, I'm barking on this one.) French Dip with side 5.99, Cup of Soup 1.99!!

Drinks come with free refills. Nice big patio for outside seating.

No WiFi (can't stay to long then) 

The decor is very French country with pastel colors, over head lighting on each table.Brightly colored tablecloths topped with plastic (just like grandmas house) Bright and sunny. Clean. Clean. Clean. I had a very good sense of cleanliness. The silverware packet was neatly placed on the table and when unfolded the silverware was spotless. Are you guys using a water softener? No spots. 

This is a good place to take mom, grandma or aunt Judy. They will appreciate all they little home touches this family run business is all about."}
{"text":"Stopped in with a friend 2/23/12 for breakfast.  It was bright, clean and not busy at 9am.  Wait staff was prompt and very nice.  Coffee and water continually filled.  My friend had a 'German Pancake\" and liked it very much. It came out hot and the extra powdered sugar we requested was quickly brought out.
I had a basic ham and cheese omelet with shredded hash browns and it was large and cooked perfectly.  My only small complaint is that they put American cheese (probably by the slice) inside instead of stepping it up a bit with real Cheddar.  (Maybe there was an option but the waitress didn't ask and neither did I)  
Absolutely worth another try.  I usually do breakfast like this on the weekends and like an option for a Bloody Mary but that is not available here."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here yesterday with my GF.  It was OK.  Solid food and reasonably prices, but nothing outstanding.  They need to change their technique to panning their bacon since the bacon was pretty rubbery.  But I thought I would just offer my two cents here with this posting."}
{"text":"Just like some other yelpers stated- mediocre at best. I tried the German pancake and I've definitely had far better, but it wasn't too shabby with a lot of lemon squeezed on it. My dining companion had an omelette with bland salsa and hash browns that were decent. I wouldn't have gone except I had a Restaurant.com coupon so opted to try it out. I'd rather go to Yoli's Cafe next time."}
{"text":"When I want breakfast the way I make at home without the hassle I go to Dessies. It almost tastes like they buy their food from the Albertsons next door. The menu is as basic as their food. The prices are reasonable and the food and service is pretty good. I would probably eat there more often if they used real half n half. I am turned off my restaurants that don't, but that is just me.  Since it is in the neighborhood and easy to get a table, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went to Dessie's once. REALLY wanted to love it because its right across the street from me. I ordered the normal eggs, hash towns, and bacon. Maybe restaurants just can't do much to make the meal great? I dunno. It was average. Te hash towns really were tasteless. I'm going to try this place again and perhaps order something else. I want to support this spot since its a locally owned...family oriented place. Ill be back and re-rate :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place! We are regular s, about once a week. Around $15 for both of us every time for really good food. I always,  ALWAYS,  get the sausage breakfast burrito.  Even for lunch, I've always tried getting something else but can't because that burrito calls my name. Oh, and the homeade salsa that comes with it, superb! I wipe every last bit out with the last of the tortilla. I have had the crispy chicken wrap which is quite tasty also. There was more crispy than chicken,  so the next time I tried it I asked if they could do grilled chicken instead and it was much better than crispy.  The service is always great, friendly staff. And the coffee,  it is the best ive ever had. Is not like the medeocre cup you get at chain restaurants. And our waitress always knows to bring me hazzelnut creamer. And also knows when to fill  my coffee, as soon as she sees the cup tilt up she brings the pot. We love thos plzce and is a little charm in Chandler.  :)"}
{"text":"Awesome friendly place! I had the veggie omelet and it was so freaking good because I never eat omelettes. They have awesome water bowls for dogs! Patio is pretty big! They had a special going on and I need to try it next. It was deep fried French toast with an orange glaze!  Def good food for your money!"}
{"text":"Dessie's I really want to like you. I will refuse to go to any Denny's or Ihop for breakfast. I will always pick 100% local. I've reviewed before and I'll review again to put in my 2 cents.

Again the green chili omelette was blah.  The green chili is obviously from a can, and its going bad, it was REALLY bad. I had to scrape it off my eggs.

So I love rock and roll more than anyone, but when I was in there 99% of your customers are elderly. So the Alice in Chains blasting from the kitchen, probably not a good idea. I don't mind it, but again I'm not 80.
2nd. Your cooks look like they're from a Mad Max film. When they're not cooking they pier through the window and stare at the customers like they're in prison.......creepy just plain creepy. 
Besides the reasonable prices and the waitress, I can't say anything positive about the place. 
Good luck in the Thunder Dome."}
{"text":"Super good food, I had the pumpkin pancake and french toast, both delicious. The pancake did not have a strong Pumkin taste, very light. The omelets are huge and packed with stuff. Also they're dog friendly, And the server usually brings out a bowl of water and bacon for your pup!"}
{"text":"This is literally a quaint mom and pop restaurant!  Old pictures of relatives decorate the walls.  It reminds me of my great aunt's house where she'd have her dining table covered in thick plastic to protect her delicate table cloth...and sofas, chairs, buffet...

Errands left me hungry as I passed by this little place tucked in a strip mall.  Tom, the owner, welcomed me in.  Tasha, his grandaughter, was very attentive and personable.  For lunch...I know, I was craving for the buttery and thick belgian waffles and a side of bacon... it came with 5 strips of crispy bacon.  If I didn't have any self control, I would have eaten the last one.  The coffee was pretty good.  I do have a thing about creamers that come in little packets, but it's okay in this casual place.

I will definitely take hubby and son here!"}
{"text":"Good food. Tried it last weekend for the first time, everything was great. The wife got the German pancake and loved it- so much so that we are heading there again right now."}
{"text":"The B.A.L.T. was delicious.  This Specialty Sandwich includes bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato on toast with garlic aioli.

The atmosphere is pretty with pastel yellow, purple and green walls. The tables have flowers on them.

The waitress was accommodating."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! We came here to try the German pancake  and boy was it good!!! It's like a sweet marriage of pancake and crepe in your mouth. We also ordered the roast beef burger and a breakfast burrito which were pretty delicious too. Our server Pat was very sweet and so was the atmosphere in the family owned cafe. Additional advantage for dog owners like us, the patio is dog friendly :) woof!!"}
{"text":"I really, really enjoyed this place. I got a chorizo omelet and it was huge and yummy. I am pretty picky about my breakfast foods. Runny eggs make me gag. Thinking of runny eggs makes me gag. They cooked my food to perfection. 
I was with a friend and we got there in what we thought was plenty of time before they closed but it turns out they had different hours in the summer than the winter so they were closing up as we got there. We started to leave but the waitress was SUPER nice and made us feel very welcome. It was a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"My husband and I are Sunday regulars for breakfast and think the food is really good.  I just wish that they would get rid of the shabby, disgusting looking plates.  Have some pride."}
{"text":"It was a super hot day when we went here and it was uncomfortably hot inside as well. There were only 3 tables seated and yet it took forever for us to get our drinks, refills and food. I don't eat pork and often have to special order menu items without bacon. NOTHING angers me more than when places forget while making the food and then pull the bacon off before serving which is what obviously happened here. I had to dissect my wrap in order to remove bits of bacon and could taste it in every bite. Totally ruined my meal. I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"We love this place! Pancakes are so good! Also, the German pancake is delicious! Must have, great service, great bacon!"}
{"text":"We tried the biscuits and gravy and 1/2 waffle with bacon. The bacon was so crispy and cooked perfectly. The waffle and biscuits were good, but just that. Also, our server was very friendly. We plan to go back and try their famous German pancake!"}
{"text":"Place was alright. Nothing spectacular. Service was good - everyone was very attentive and food comes out super quick. The person I was with got the special - the dirty Sanchez - which was biscuits and gravy on top of eggs and hash browns all covered with adobo sauce and cheddar cheese. Not the prettiest presentation but he ate it up and loved all of the flavors. I Got the two egg breakfast - originally came out with a big black hair in the eggs which I noticed immediately. The waitress apologized and returned about two minutes later with \"a whole new plate.\"  Seems hard to believe that they were able to do redo everything in that amount of time but whatever, I ate it. I didn't complain at all but I feel as though something else could have been done considering the situation - perhaps a discount or make my coffee free or a gift card so I would give them another shot. I don't plan to return but I may have if the workers were more apologetic. Other than this the potatoes were quite bland but palatable after adding some hot sauce. Positive note - eggs were cooked exactly as I had ordered them (over easy) with perfectly runny yolks and the wheat bread is very tasty with lots of seeds and grains. However, considering the bigger picture I will probably not return."}
{"text":"Have never been here before and was looking for something new to try for our ladies breakfast group.  We all LOVED it!  Staff was super friendly!  We all felt like we were back in grandma's kitchen.  Very homey and comfortable.  Outdoor seating is pet friendly!  Food was delicious!  If you haven't gone here yet, you are missing out!  Give them a try.  You'll be glad you did!  :)"}
{"text":"Not much to say but they were short handed, Is that restaurants excuse for bad service?"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I was pleasantly surprised by the flavors in the German pancake. I highly recommend everyone to try this spot at least once."}
{"text":"Great place to go too for breakfast. Never been disappointed, I love the atmosphere and friendly staff.. the food is amazing"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least once a week!  The food is excellent and the staff makes you feel right at home. I have no idea how that cook gets the food out so fast!  I was crushed to find out that it will be closing on July 31. I will miss everyone there and am sorry to see a local business leave!  Best of luck to the staff and thanks for 7 years of great food!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and Dessie's does breakfast very nicely. A brand new spot painted in lovely pastel colors, think of a gorgeous Easter Basket and that is the inviting interior of Dessie's. They get 3.5 stars. 

We arrived on a Saturday and took a seat and were met with quite a few breakfast items, namely eggs, pancakes, waffles, bacon and sausage. Nothing outlandish, just simple American comfort foods. I ordered the Eggs Benedict which was truly the most exotic item on the menu. 

The eggs were hard and the hollandaise sauce was a bit bland and not velvety more lumpy. The hashbrowns were fantastic. My husband had the pancakes and he said they were excellent. Overall, a very sunshiny breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Fabulous food in a super friendly environment.  Staff is fantastic...always a full cup of hot coffee. Breakfast is my meal here never disappoints."}
{"text":"You have to love independent restaurants.  Cozy, good decor, nice omelettes.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time visit. Small quaint place, fills up with patrons real quick after 0800 Sunday. Limited number of tables and I suspect a nice outdoor cafe seating when weather is pleasant. A little warm temp inside with fans everywhere, still a bit too warm fur be to enjoy a meal.

I had biscuits and gravy combo with eggs and bacon, along with a small portion of French Toast. I had wanted a half order of Belgium Waffle but the machine was broken. The French Toast was normal bread, a bit of a hint of griddle taste which I didn't care for. Ample serving of biscuits and gravy with a decent taste that will let you know it's home made. A bit pricy I thought, $17.00.

All in all, ok experience. Will give this place another try before making my mind up if this is a good breakfast spit."}
{"text":"Decent Breakfast Joint.

Finally got around to stopping by for breakfast with my boy. A bit of confusion getting a table at first but finally got to sit down.

I had the huevos rancheros which where pretty good. Link sausage were big and tasty. My son had some sides but the hash browns were a little under cooked. Juice could have been a bit colder too.

$29 after tip seemed like a bit much for two of us for breakfast and they guy cleaning the tables could have trimmed beard and tucked in boxers but overall not too bad."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here multiple times, and all times it was delicious home cooked breakfast and they use real cracked eggs for their omelets upon ordering.. NOT yellow stuff from a carton that many many other places use for omelets.. they take time to actually scramble fresh eggs for the omelet. I had veggie and it was yummy, and also had steak and eggs also yummy.. so much food took 1/2 home!!"}
{"text":"It has a hole in the wall feeling to it, but dont be scared, it's good. It can be good or bad service depending on who is serving here that day. Would actually give the place 3.5 stars. You have to be ok with the cook who randomly plays music in the kitchen that you can hear in the dining room such as Metallica. Lucky for their asses Enter Sandman actually made my florentine omelette taste delicious!"}
