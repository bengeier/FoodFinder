{"text":"I really appreciate this place - having moved here from NYC, discovering Poppy's helped me feel at home. Great bagels, great deli selections, amazing kugel (which is not an easy feat). My only complaint is the overuse of black pepper...Latkes and matzo balls shouldn't taste heavily of pepper - I've never seen it used in matzo balls or chicken soup at all. It was a bit alarming to bite into, and even more disappointing to discover on a day when I was feeling under the weather and craved my favorite feel-good foods."}
{"text":"Being from NJ/NY I moved down being very critical of food quality. This is hands down my favorite breakfast place in Charlotte. The food is tasty and fresh. Weekends you might see a long line in the mornings but it is completely worth it to us. Their chocolate chip cream cheese on cinnamon sugar bagel is awesome! We've since moved 45 minutes away from here and we still come just to come here!"}
{"text":"Finally! A real bagel place in Charlotte! Poppy's reminds me of bagel places I used to frequent in the Bronx. Absolutely fantastic bagels, which they make in house. They have a cooler filled with all sorts of deli yummies, which I'm always tempted to order, but I usually fall back on my standard pumpernickel bagel with cream cheese and lox, which they serve with capers, tomato, and red onion. Scrumptious. 

The line is long on the weekends, especially on Sundays when the after-church crowd comes in, but it moves quickly and I never worry about getting a seat, even when I'm there with my while family. The owners and staff are so friendly- I can't believe there are complaints about service,  because I've never had a problem. They were nice the first time I was there, and by the third time I was a regular. They know my name, call me hon, and compliment my kids. With that, delicious food, and great coffee, what more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place as soon as I walked in. Nice little bagel shop. I live twenty minutes away and still come here simply because I think it has some of the best bagels in charlotte. I really like the everything bagel toasted with jalapeño cream cheese. Would definitely recommend a stop here if you're in the Queen City."}
{"text":"I went here before Christmas and had a lox and bagel.  Very good.  I went again this morning and ordered the same.  Very hard to find the lox in the sandwhich.  If you are going to charge 7.00 then make sure there is actually some lox on the bagel.  As usual - cheaping out.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a bit far for me or I would be a regular. The product itself is very good. We all know what sets you apart is your service. The current manager there is very good. I like that the cook always makes my eggs the way I ask for them."}
{"text":"This place is has a nice patio outside ,very relaxing. Maybe the only good thing I could say about my visit. But the worst part was when I was ordering.The owner seemed to ignore everyone in line, constantly on his phone and completely rude. Didn't have a clue how much things were and was very unprofessional. So if you feel like waiting all day in line just to order go here."}
{"text":"Hard to add anything to the other stellar reviews but this place has consistently the most fantastic NY bagels in CLT.  They rival some of the best bagels in NY too.   All of you chain store bagel people don't know what you are missing.  It can get a little busy at times but they really do get you your food quickly.  Sandwiches are a little pricey but are really stuffed with good stuff so they are worth it."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place! Fantastic food, wonderful environment and OUTSTANDING service! Always feel at home and welcomed here."}
{"text":"Beware of Fruit Flies!  Unless you like dining with these incredible pests, take your food and go.  On weekends it is incredibly busy - tons of people working but apparently not cleaning so well.  I'm giving 2 stars because the food was delicious and has been consistently but I had to eat it in my car because it was so gross inside."}
{"text":"My son and I came in on Sunday morning and Barbara took care of us. She was extremely cheerful and pleasant. Great service!"}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe I found a real NYC bagel outside of NYC. Just like a bagel should be - a little crunchy on the outside, but deliciously chewy on the inside - YUM! 

The potato salad and pasta salad were also delicious.

I went on a Sunday morning so the line wasn't short, but it was worth the wait. Give this place a try if you love a traditional NY bagel!"}
{"text":"On February 27th I went to enjoy the great bagels with a group of friends and felt disrespected by one of the employees not only did she disrespect my friend and I but also an elderly woman, it really came to my attention because not once has anyone been rude to me at poppys everyone is very kind and attentive but this woman was just very rude as we made the line i ordered my bagel and did not hear her say \"for here or to go\" and then she repeated her herself making hand gestures as if she was annoyed that i did not listlen and repeated the question with an attitude and added the word \"sweetie\" then my friend since it was his fist time visiting poppys as i made a great recommendation of the bagels did not know what to get but it just seemed as she was in such a rush that we all got the same 4 bagels since she didnt even give him any time to look because she decided to hurry him up by saying \"get it together yankee\".  We all felt very insulted by her and felt like it was something that needed to be addressed.  Not only did she have that attitude with us but with many of the elderly people which saddens me to think that since its a breakfast place she might be ruining everyones day with her poor attitude or will to work there.  Her appearance was black hair, New York accent, mid age.  Now that i think about it it could of been the owner since, if she worked for me she would be fired by now.   

Thanks,

Gabriella Zubiate"}
{"text":"Being from New York, I had to get my fill of bagels during my trip to Charlotte. This was a very good place. I went mid Sunday morning and the line was very long but it went quickly. It was a little pricey...$25 for 2 egg sandwiches, a soup and 2 drinks? Even though they wrote down our order, we did have to repeat it to the cashier. That system could have been a bit more organized (why don't they just give us a copy of the order to hand to the cashier?) They did bring the food directly to me at my table which was a nice touch! Very tasty good!"}
{"text":"Poppys bagels is a decent way place for breakfast. Their location is easy to find and it seems to be a very successful business. However there are some critiques. Bagel was a bit on the hard side and lacked that authentic \"yeast\" taste. The strawberry cream cheese I had was excellent dinner very fresh tasting. The mazo ball soup is on the sweet side and about unappetizing. Also poppys should set up some sort of online ordering because their line moves extremely slowly. I sincerely hope poppys can make these improvements."}
{"text":"Food is great, but don't come within 30 minutes of closing time. All the chairs on the tables, food is wrapped up and a rude owner who will remind you that they close and you need to take it to go."}
{"text":"See my picture above; it's the most recent with the sorry excuse for double cream cheese. I have absolutely no reason to make this up. Yes, this is truly a bagel from Poppys."}
{"text":"Those were the most beautiful and NY style Bagels I have had in a long time, Breugers bagels not even in the same league. And the cream cheese is amazing lots of selection, I love this place. Everything
Is fresh, they cook breakfast to order and the staff
Is friendly and most are from N.Y, I know the 
Owner is, his name is Ron.
Try the soup it's amazing, I had the chicken 
soup, my wife has a chicken salad sandwich 
and loved it. 

I have been in Charlotte for five years
and finally there is a place like home authentic
deli style NY food here."}
{"text":"Great bagels and sandwiches... taste of NY in Charlotte!  Recently discovered their chicken salad and it's absolutely to die for"}
{"text":"Look no farther! Best bagels in town! I always want to get a sandwich for lunch, but I can't bring myself to get anything but delicious house-made smear."}
{"text":"The white fish is fresh, the bagels are awesome, and the tomatoes are great not hard and still very flavorfull. I would highly recomend this place"}
{"text":"I just walked out of there $12 poorer with NO FOOD after 25 minutes of trying to figure out where my order was. No apology no refund. Their food is great and I so love to support local but I'm finished with them. They need to get a clue on how to run a service business."}
{"text":"Grabbed my coffee from somewhere new this morning.  Threw some honey in it, thanks.  Had a tasty Croissant'which, and snagged an everything bagel for l8r, which was a soft buttery dank treat!  One of the sweetest bagels I've ever had.  Liked the covered patio keepin it dry and the prompt & courteous service... Gettin a duz next time"}
{"text":"Meh...the bagel was very doughy...I prefer a lighter bagel with some crisp to the outside.  Wasted my $ on that cheese danish too! Won't rush to take a trip back to this spot...I'll stick with the E's & B's shops of Charlotte till I can find a better authentic, creative bagel spot."}
{"text":"Incredible bagels, but the staff has gotten complacent and customer service has really plummeted over the past year or two. The last few times I've been in, my order has been totally forgotten once, staff members have that eyes-glazed-over look of indifference, and one young woman there barks instructions at customers with the dead-eyes voice of the \"white zone is for loading and unloading only\" person. 

Incredible food and bagels. And it's worth the wait and the hassle of an inconvenient parking lot and insufficient square footage in the restaurant...but it's not worth the attitude that the staff has developed."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Charlotte!!! The line may be long on Saturday mornings, but it's so worth it and my husband& I make it a weekly ritual! The coffee is delicious too and it's about $2 cheaper than their competitor down the road for a sausage, egg and cheese bagel with a small coffee. Great bagels and great family atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Even though Owens is a great spot conveniently close to Uptown- I make the drive to Poppys. I go every weekend now- I like to order Lox w/ Scallion Cream cheese on poppy. They never disappoint"}
{"text":"I go to Charlotte on business regularly and on my last visit went to Poppy's Bagels and More.  They are, hands down, the best bagels in Charlotte!  Crusty and slightly chewy, they are true NYC-style bagels!  My cinnamon raisin was fresh from the oven.  The Waldorf chicken salad was great and so was the fruit salad - totally fresh with lots of berries and ripe melon.  And, the staff is incredibly welcoming and friendly.  Overall a great place."}
{"text":"The bagels here are great! Taste fresh and the wait time is negligible. They were fast and friendly. It does get crowded, but the line moves fast as they are extremely efficient. A great bagel spot."}
{"text":"Too bad the bagel and schmear were delicious, because the service was terrible. When I ordered my chicken soup + matzo ball (which was alright but not worth $5.99) I asked for it in the plastic container to go, I was argued with, being told the paper like container was more safe and better for soup...it promptly spilled because the lid wasn't tight enough, and in my car."}
{"text":"Hands down the nest bagels I've ever had. It gets busy so be ready to,stand in line."}
{"text":"They have the best breakfast bagel sandwiches! Their lunch menu is really good too.  The only issue (small) is that weekend's there's a line out the door in the mornings.

But that's because they're so good."}
{"text":"Bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon was delicious! We went in and the long was very long, but it moved quickly and our food came out not too soon after we ordered.  Very fast service!"}
{"text":"I went to Poppy's on the recommendation of a friend and am ecstatic that I found it.  I have been twice so far, and gotten a breakfast sandwich both times.  First time was a simple ham, egg white (yes!!!), and cheese on sesame.  Wrapped in aluminum foil and tossed in the bag, it stayed warm until I could eat it about 30 minutes later.

During my first visit I noticed that they had homemade cream cheeses in the display case, one of which had jalapeno's in it.  I knew I had to try it, so got the same sandwich as above, just with the jalapeno cream cheese instead of sliced cheese.  Incredible.

My father-in-law is a huge fan of smoked salmon, whitefish salad, etc., so I had to take a picture of the huge display in the store and e-mail it to him.  Looked like a great selection, although that stuff isn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Great bagel sandwiches, long long lines, overly salty everything bagels, but the fella loves them. I want to try the deli- it looks promising. Nice outdoor seating, even in cold weather."}
{"text":"So good, every time! I'm from Raleigh and always have to make a stop by when I'm in Charlotte. The chicken salad bagel is my favorite!"}
{"text":"The deli style service is fast and friendly. Overall I would totally recommend to someone who loves bagels.  The bagels are so delicious and fresh tasting, just wish they would toast their breakfast sandwiches automatically.  The person taking the order forgot to ask me if I wanted it toasted (and I didn't know you had to request it) and the cold bagel with the warm egg, bacon and cheese was not a good combo, but I will remember for next time.  Their salads they have in their front case are good too, just wish they had labels on the different kinds, since it is a bit of an inconvenience to both myself and the order taker to go through and tell me what all of them are.  They do text in orders as well if you want to avoid the weekend rush."}
{"text":"Best bagels and Charlotte not to mention a lot bigger bagels them their Competitors.  Nothing like a decent size portion for breakfast"}
{"text":"This is a great little place in a retail/dining section of Charlotte that could use a little more traffic.  I hope Poppy's does well for a long time!  I'm not a bagel connoisseur, but I can confidently say that Poppy's are quite good.  

I had a turkey on Honey Wheat bagel.  The sliced meat tasted very fresh and seemed to be of high quality.  They use very spicy mustard- -which is awesome.  I ordered mine with lettuce and tomato, both were fine.  The bagel, itself, was just the right level of crusty on the outside/soft on the inside.  It had a nice, nutty flavor too. 

The service was okay.  It took a little while, and they seemed a little disorganized, but not a big deal at all. The space is attractive and clean.   The chairs and tables are crammed in a little tight for my taste, but- - again- - no biggie.  I'll definitely try Poppy's again.  I am much more of a morning-bagel person, so I look forward to going near breakfast time."}
{"text":"Got the breakfast special on a salt bagel - and salty it was, woah!  The coffee was served in plastic cups (which warped from the heat and I'm sure leached chemicals into my coffee) but other than that very reminiscent of NYC."}
{"text":"BEST bagels and cream cheese I've had since being in New York.  The cream cheese is to die for and is all homemade.  I got the blueberry cream cheese and it was loaded with large blueberries.  It's worth the 3-hour drive!"}
{"text":"FINALLY got the chance to check out Poppy's Bagels for the first time after an intense workout this Saturday. 

This is a no frills bagel shop. I got a bacon and egg on everything and my husband got a bacon, egg, and cheese on poppy. The bagel is what stood out and the everything bagel was the better one. It was probs the best tasting bagel I have had in this city. Absolutely fantastic. I noticed they had a handful of pastas, salads, cheeses, pastries, etc to order that also looked fantastic. Additionally, I got a hazelnut coffee and appreciated they had a few different flavored coffees.

We opted for to-go but there was a decent amount of seating outside. Lastly, this place had a long line when we got there but the line and ordering went SO fast. Impressive."}
{"text":"Ok, not the greatest but will do until I can get back to Pennsylvania! Need to work on their fried ham egg and cheese sandwiches! Definitely overpriced!"}
{"text":"My bagel with egg and cheese was pretty good. My kids got bagels with cream cheese. There might've been as much cream cheese as there was bagel."}
{"text":"Oy.  So you're in Charlotte and looking for a bagel.  What to do?  Certainly there are plenty of options but none as good - bagel-wise - as Poppy's.  If you know good, New York bagels then you'll be overjoyed to find Poppy's.  Close your eyes when you bite down into the bagel of your choice and you'll be transported to Manhattan.  They're fresh, often still warm from the oven and simply perfect.

Why a Four Stars instead of a Five?  They're a little (not a lot, just a little) on the high side price-wise.  A buttered bagel is a reasonable $1.50 with tax.  With cream cheese, still pretty reasonable at $2.25 with tax.  But buttered bagel with swiss cheese?  OMFG!  Five frikkin dollars?  Gimme a break.  I thought she made a mistake when I saw the price but she said, \"Well, it's four slices of swiss.\"    No worries.Next time I brought my own slices of swiss and discretely added them to my buttered bagel.  (I'd give em 4 1/2 stars if I could.)

OK, that gripe aside, I've never had anything here I don't like.  If you're Jewish you probably know \"kugel\" (noodle casserole).  Man, this was the bomb.  Tasted just like my mother made it.  Wow.  Had a mediterranean pasta salad; yum.  

There are twin young women who work behind the counter who are a delight.  It's a friendly place and people seem eager to please.

If you're ever looking for me; head to Poppy's on any Sunday morning around 10am and you'll find me there enjoying."}
{"text":"Not easy to find a bagel shop that makes a good bagel and serves lox.  This place does!  A salt, with plain cream cheese, lox, capers and onion is just like my Jewish Grandma use to make in NY.  (Truthfully, I didn't have a Jewish Grandmother but I am from NY and know a good bagel.) This place is fast and friendly.  You can try and find a tiny table in the tiny eating area with a cup of coffee, or you can go home and eat your bagel in front of the TV with your Sunday Paper-that is our preference.  They have a decent selection of sides (more CLT style than NY Deli-but they try) and the coffee is decent."}
{"text":"Been here twice, first time no complaint.  Second time - yesterday - I ask for poppy seed bagel toasted with cream cheese, cucumber and red onion.  Also added on the Italian sandwich for lunch later on.  Sando was good, but the bagel was par-toasted (just enough to tease but right in the middle where it's worse than a toasted bagel and an untoasted bagel) and the cream cheese was applied about the same as it mayonnaise would be if you ordered a Whopper easy mayo.  Made it thru a few bites and threw most of it away.  

It's your namesake bagel (well probably named after a or for someone's dad, but still) folks!   Please tell me it was just a really bad day."}
{"text":"Having grown up on Long Island I'm accustomed to some delicious bagels typically unmatched anywhere else in the country. Because of this I was challenged with finding an equivalent when I moved to Charlotte. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Poppy's Bagels nails it!

As mentioned in some other reviews here, Poppy's delivers when it comes to NY-style bagels and other deli delights. Something about a steaming hot bacon egg and cheese that does the body good. Not a breakfast fan? Not a problem. I've stopped into Poppy's at least on a couple of occasions for lunch and like any other superior NY/NY-style deli Boars Head meats are the upper echelon of cold cuts and helps Poppy's score big in my book. Stop in sometime for one of the best bagels in Charlotte but be sure to plan on it becoming a weekly ritual!"}
{"text":"I am a transplant from NY, and I have tried nearly every independent bagel store in Charlotte.  Serveral advertise \"NY Bagels\" and most of them are doing so falsely.  Poppy's Bagels has the only bagel I have ever eaten outside of Long Island that tastes like a NY bagel.  It is perfect.  Also, the veggie cream cheese is amazing and very close to authentic.  Since finding Poppy's I have been back several times...it feels like I'm at my local bagel shop back on Long Island.  My search for the perfect NY bagel is over....Poppy's is the only place to go for bagels, hands down."}
{"text":"I loved loved this place and can't wait to go back! I order a sausage, egg and cheese on a wheat bagel ( and a little salt, pepper and ketchup NY deli style ) and it was perfect! 
Service was quick and accurate. Nice out door seating area, that's decorated for fall!"}
{"text":"the only bagels I will ever buy in Charlotte. the literal best scallion cream cheese. I've been going religiously for months but I just decided to write this review after having a bruggers bagel. Nothing compares to poppys I just wish they were open later. p.s. I usually get garlic or onion bagel with scallion cream cheese toasted."}
{"text":"Don't know what the problem is with a previous poster ... these are as good as any I've had living and eating in both New York and Skokie Illinois (suburb of Chicago).  Much better than the run-of-the-mill stuff normally available in Charlotte."}
{"text":"First time here. Nice location. Plenty of parking. The staff was very helpful.
Ordered a bagel sandwich; egg (wasn't scrambled, good!), sausage and cheese on plain bagel. four bagels; two Everything, one Salt and one Blueberry, two individual sides of cream cheese; one scallion and one blueberry, Two fresh chocolate chip scones and two coffees.

Order total was $23. Reasonable. I feel like this was a lot of fresh food for a descent price.

A few more details about the items;

The sausage on the sandwich seemed homemade and very fresh. Not too spicy,but a little heat. Very tasty.

Bagels were large, chewy, crusty outside with fresh airy inside. Everything was very flavorful. Salt bagel had right amount of sat, very good, Blueberry lacked a good berry flavor, so that was disappointing.

The cream cheese appeared to be mixed in store. Both the scallion and blueberry had the desired favors without being overly strong.

The scones were soft and full of chocolate chips. They were very fresh and flavorful. Maybe a little on the dry side, which I think scones are supposed to be, so enjoy with milk, coffee or tea.

Worth the visit for sure."}
{"text":"The search is over, after moving from NYC 3 years ago.  Best bagels in Charlotte, easily.  Came with my wife and kids and we enjoyed perfectly made bagels (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside), white fish spread, lox, coffee, and kind service. We are coming back...tomorrow."}
{"text":"If you wanna' feel like you've stepped into a NY deli, this is the place. Only difference, (I've been told by people from NY), is they're so much more friendly. Great food. Great service. Excellent prices. And local, which is always important to me. They wave over the counter and say hi every time I walk in. Cool place!"}
{"text":"Poppys gets 5 stars for the food. We took my grandparents here today, who are from NY and very particular about their bagels. Nothing bad can be said about the food itself.

However, we arrived at about 2:30 being unaware they closed at 3pm. They were already putting chairs on tables and cleaning to floors. The staff itself seemed put out hat we came in and wanted to eat. A few min to 3 the vacuuming began. We started leaving but the door was blocked by vacuum chords, staff, and trash cans. By the time my grandfather, with his poor balance, navigated the obstacle course we then had to dodge plants being watered and staff chatting outside.

So, in short, fantastic food with sub par staff."}
{"text":"I have to agree with other reviewers: they're not New York bagels, but they're pretty damn good all the same. 

I had sausage, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel, and it definitely hit the spot I was seeking to fill. The sausage wasn't quite my taste (next time I'll try the bacon) but this was more than offset by the great preparation of the fried egg, with a thin layer of yolk distributed throughout. 

As for the bagel itself, the texture, flavor, and chewiness were on the mark, albeit missing that je no sais quoi in NY bagels. Maybe it's the water? I don't know, but I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"I have never walked in to Poppy's Bagels & More.  I cannot tell you about their ambience, noise level, parking, smiling faces, etc... What I CAN tell you is that Ronnie went out of his way to DELIVER bagels to my office this morning for our breakfast, and these are THE BEST bagels I've ever eaten.... hands down, bar none, etc... DELICIOUS... Fresh, fragrant, chewy, delicious bagel-y goodness with scrumptious cream cheese options... EVERYONE in my office is happy and super grateful this morning!  Thank you SO much, Poppy's!!!  We look forward to working with you again and again!! Lots of love!"}
{"text":"This place is soul food to me. They have the best bagels in Charlotte. I like everything I have tried there from salmon salad to potato pancakes. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and am fortunate to have them located so conveniently to my home."}
{"text":"Awesome everything bagel with fried egg and cheese.  Seriously good bagel sammy.  The place has a nice vibe and although there was a line, it moved quickly.  There appeared to be many choices and things to see while you are lined up. Will definitely return for other items."}
{"text":"Tons of cream cheese on the salmon so I had to wipe it off but it was delicious! It wasn't the best bagel but it was still good. I wish they had a whole wheat option though!"}
{"text":"Soooo happy you are closer to the house. The drive was worth it but the new shop is excellent to have in the neighborhood. Helps the New York blues when they hit with a great bagel and desserts"}
{"text":"A complete wonderful surprise, what a GEM!!!

It's just as good as Bagel Bin, maybe better!!! 



·Egg bagel toasted with butter- yummy!! 

·Egg bagel toasted with Lox- my friend loved it!!!

·Land o lakes milk- Really rich and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious bagels and worth the wait. My first trip was on a weekend and there was a long wait but totally worth the tasty everything bagel with egg, bacon. I think they are definitely the best ones I have had in town.
The line moved but get there early."}
{"text":"I'm not a bagel person I admit, but my review is based on the non-bagel sandwiches I have ordered which were both absolutely delicious!! There is hands down no better French Dip in Charlotte and I have eaten a few over the years. The $13.99 price is a bit steep so be prepared for that. IMO, you should at least get a side or bag of chips for that price but hey, I'm sure their rent ain't cheap and when your food is that good it's kinda hard to complain. I do wish they would give you a larger plastic cup for water drinkers like myself. It looked like one of those Dixie bathroom cups you use to rinse your mouth out lol. I know they do that as a deterrent so you will order a tea or something but i did find that little tiny cup laughable. But that won't stop me from going back. Next up, the Reuben."}
{"text":"Been to Poppy's now several times. I a recent trip back to Charlotte, I made sure it was on my list for a breakfast stop before I left. It's busy most hours of the mornings on the weekends, but try to get there before 9am to avoid longer lines and the incoming church crowd from across the street. This will give you a better shot to sit outside.

Great for breakfast sandwiches, but also the homemade cream cheese is a winner. My fav is the jalapeño! Plenty of fruit and other breakfast items like quick omelets and lox. If bagel lunch is your thing, they've got deli sandwiches and sides ready for you.

Personal favorite is the bacon, egg & cheese on an everything bagel. Make sure to get the extra egg for 50 cents to balance out the bread."}
{"text":"I was sad when Starbucks moved out and wary when Poppy's Bagels & More moved in.  I thought there was no way a no-name start-up business was going to do well there if Starbucks couldn't make it.  Looks like I was wrong.  We've visited Poppy's a couple of times for breakfast so far this summer.  They're a fantastic alternative to any other \"fast food\" breakfast place, including Panera.  

I've only tried the breakfast bagel sandwiches, but they are excellent.  The bagels are fresh, delicious, and large.  You can get fried or scrambled eggs on them (a nice option that you usually can't find elsewhere), cheese, and/or meat.  For $4, it's a great value, too.  Their breakfast scones and muffin tops look delicious, too, but I try to be good and limit myself to only a sandwich.  Another bonus:  they have flavored coffees!   I've tried the vanilla, but the chocolate raspberry is my favorite.  

I've never been for lunch, but the sandwiches they offer sound fantastic, too, and everything in the display case (like a grocer's deli area) looks fresh and good to bring home, too.  

The seating can be limited, though, especially on the weekends when we go.  We've been fortunate that it's not hot (or raining) and there's been an empty table outside.  The inside is usually filled with kids/families for breakfast and the seating looks super-cramped.  I'm not sure how it is in the winter.  

My only disappointment would be how one person takes your order and then you have to repeat the entire order to the cashier to ring it up.  There should be some way for the person initially taking the order to relay the information to the cashier.  It feels like a time waster, and if you're paying for your party, you may not remember everything they ordered!

I do highly recommend the bagels, though (the only thing I've really eaten there so far), because they're probably the best I've had in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Poppy's are hands down, BEST bagels in Charlotte! We've tried numerous places and these are the most authentic and fresh in the city. Located in a little shopping center, this place is always packed!! Get here early, and always get the homemade cream cheese!!! The scallion cream cheese is by far the best, with the vegetable and plain also being great! Go in and try some for yourself, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday early afternoon and was not all that impressed...

I came in with the idea that I was just going to have a bagel but while waiting on line i decided I would get the Prosciutto Paninni with Mozzarella. After waiting what felt like forever because they were pretty unorganized I ordered it with a side of a Dozen Bagels...for the fam of course! 

Well the girl helping me was kinda rude she was talking with another girl working and looks at me and was like I'm listening while she has her head turned to the other girl and is still carrying on with they're conversation...really am I supposed to yell my order out just so you may be able to catch it or how about you look at me and actually look like you care..and the owner was standing right there but didn't even take it in...very unprofessional! So she now looks at me and says she will be right back to put my sandwich order in and will be right back, I was in the way of the other people trying to order and pay but I needed to pick out my bagels, she returns and i find myself yelling out everything at the same time trying to not get in people way...There has got to be a better way of doing this! No?

So we sit and my sandwich comes out and it was ok the meat was cut too thick for my liking but it was ok. I tried the bagels later on and they were ok better than some of the places in Charlotte but not the best Ive ever had."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fantastic NY style bagel place. Great \"everything\" bagels that were very flavorful. Various flavors of cream cheeses. I had olive flavored and it was very good. We also had a \"cigar\" pastry which has Nutella in it. Great!"}
{"text":"New York style place with the best bagels you can have. In a rush? They even accept orders by text message. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great to see a NYC style appetizing joint flourishing in Charlotte. Good bagels and solid selection of deli salads etc. Tuna is very good."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick breakfast. It's a little tight/crowded but the bagel and coffee cake were very good. Lots of selection and variety."}
{"text":"I'm a bit biased, my store is right across the street from Poppy's so I am eating here quite a bit.  With that said these guys have what it takes and need local love to stay.

Every morning Ronnie, the owner, starts his day at around 4am making everything from scratch.  They don't open till 7 and they close at 3 or 4pm, you do the math, that's dedication to freshness.

The front of house is run by a menagerie of friendly ladies including Ronnie's mother Georgiana.  They do their best to handle your order timely but as some have said they do get quite busy around peak food times--get in a bit before or after for a swift and personable meal.

My staple meal is an everything bagel, toasted, add mayo, cheese, fried egg and bacon or the country ham.  It's rather cheap and really good.  Other times I surf their specials from chicken parma panini or Ronnie will make a slow cooked brisket from time to time which is really delicious.

Easily the best bagel in Charlotte and now their starting to sell them around the area.  If you are a fan of Katz hidden away at the Arboretum them you can enjoy their bagels there.

As a coffee geek I'm a little let down that their coffee service is par to sub par but that's really their only weak point.  One day they might get a coffee geek in their work-staff and then that could turn around.

Otherwise they are family, hard working, and dedicated to good products!"}
{"text":"Poppy's is a great authentic NY style deli and bagel shop.  The bagels are undoubtedly some of the best, if not the best in the area.  I've never had lunch here, but all the pasta/potato salads among other cold items in the glass display look really good.  Everything bagel with lox all the way and a large coffee is my order. I don't switch it up often."}
{"text":"I'd had this place bookmarked forever....so you better believe the first time I was in the area I stopped in! 

First sign that I'd made the right choice? The line was practically out the door. When I made it up to the counter all the staff were very kind and everything is made to order. The menu is posted but they also offer specials during the week for breakfast and lunch so that's a total win! 

Oh and there's a ridiculously good selection of salads in the display. So I'm sure you'll get sucked in like I did! 

I opted for an Everything bagel with egg whites, cheese and bacon, with a small side of the BACON potato salad (yeah for breakfast...don't judge me). 

My goodness that thing was good. The bagel was so fresh and perfectly toasted. It arrived to my table still hot with crispy bacon and a good amount of cheese....I practically inhaled it. 

Could it really be that good? Yes! 

Will I be back? Uh...duh! Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a basic, including a basic breakfast sandwich b/c some days having all the components of breakfast separately is just too much work (most of these days come after a night that was a really good time :) and that is where Poppy's fits into my life. 

The first time walking in can be a little overwhelming- especially if it's busy but I have found the staff to always be fine, though not necessarily overly friendly; however, if you refer to the above paragraph, and consider I am usually mildly hungover on my visits- then I think we can all agree that this type of service is perfectly fine by me. 

I don't drink it, but according to my husband, they have a good iced coffee and he likes that so it makes me happy too. 

The only reason I am knocking one star is b/c of how crazy busy it is at times- which I know isn't there fault and is a good thing for them, it makes me a bit crazy and I feel claustrophobic so I typically try to go early morning or off times to avoid this."}
{"text":"I had Poppys for the first time today. Many people claim these to be the best bagels in charlotte. I wouldn't go that far, but they were good. The service was excellent. The guy who helped me out was super friendly and food was pretty quick despite them being super busy. I got an everything bacon egg and cheese. It was hot and toasted. The bagel didn't have much topping on it but tasted yummy still."}
{"text":"A diamond in the area! My husband and I came into town for a conference, and we love to try small places, this was like striking gold on day one. Since then hubby and one of his co workers have come here almost everyday for breakfast and I'm ending the week with another stop myself. During the week we've had traditional bagels with cream cheese, the blt on a bagel, breakfast sandwiches and have yet to be disappointed . Service was very friendly and well organized staff. The bagels are some of the freshest bagels I have ever had!"}
{"text":"enjoyable breakfast sandwiches and great service. Go to St. Gabriels Church across the street on a Sunday Morning and enjoy a bagel sandwich afterwards!"}
{"text":"Happened on this place 2 weeks ago after a massage, spent $55 on an impulse take out order. The bagels were fantastic and I raved about them to friends and co-workers. Stopped by today when I was in the area again to get a cream cheese.  It was 3:03 (closing was 3:00) and they refused my purchase. Told them I just wanted one cream cheese and I'd  pay cash or credit, whichever was easier, they said, \"No, we are closed.\"  There were still customers inside.

I have been in the service industry for years and detest poor customer service, whether it's on the phone with AT&T or in a privately owned bagel shop.  I will probably not return and will certainly be sharing the negative experience I had today with the same friends and co-workers.  It's a shame that a local business can't look beyond a three minute time frame to see the bigger picture."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town. They also have a selection of salads and fresh fruit in the display case. Love this place."}
{"text":"Wandering around Harris Teeter Morrocroft (Taj)  this morning, decided to pick up some smoked salmon with all the fixins'.  Did not want to drive to Poppy's for a bagel, so I decided to just break down and buy a couple from Harris Teeter. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh.  Bright light shining, angels singing.  POPPY'S bagels are in the bin at Harris Teeter!!"}
{"text":"Bagels are outstanding. Being from NJ, I can be classified as a Bagel snob. If they have THEC, that's Taylor Ham Egg and Cheese then they are ok in my book. Service was super fast and everyone was so friendly. Coffee was also good which where I come from is a defining charactetistic."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome there as evidenced by the crowds, need to work on speed of service, can't always wait 20 minutes for a delicious bagel."}
{"text":"One of the best bagel place in Charlotte ...I ordered bagel with veggie cream cheese and onion, tomato and cucumber.. it was perfect and delicious.. hazelnut coffee was a hit too .. I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Yay I'm a fan - this was one of the best bagels I have come by in the Queen City - well maybe in the south in general.  Definitely New York style bagels.  It looked like all the cream cheeses were made in house and you can make your own omelet to top on any bagel you want.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  I would love to come back for lunch and give them a try - all boar's head meats and made from scratch soups."}
{"text":"I freaking love bagels. Basically, anything made out of bread, or within in the family of bread, typically makes its way into my heart....and stomach. I greatly appreciate a good bagel with cream cheese and pretty much at any point in the day. 

Poppy's totally delivers. A quaint shop off of Sharon Amity/Providence with a a ton of options. A semi-shotgun set up with ample seating and plenty of natural light. A great place for breakfast with a buddy or the whole family. Also, there are 4 coolers filled with beverages. OJ, other juices, sodas, milk and tons of other choices. I'm a big morning beverage person so this is much appreciated. 

There is also a ton of other items the main cooler. Deli items galore and plenty of salads of all types and chopped items good for a picnic or potluck. 

Now, the bagels. Phenomenally large bagels with a nice chew and plenty of space for schmearing butter or cream cheese. The honey wheat and blueberry variety were choice and both are worth their weight. Many other flavors to choose from and I can't wait to check the rest of them out. Love that they slice the bagels all the weight length wise and only half of the way for the width. Super helpful when you're driving and need to tear off a honkin' piece!

The staff is super friendly and they move quick. Love it and can't wait to head back in for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love bagels. I know they are not the best for me and I don't care. They are just the perfect carb (which is certainly stiff competition). And I will admit, I am a bit of a bagel snob. What can I say? NY bagels spoiled me.

Enter Poppy's.

Real NY bagels made by real NY transplants. Egg bagels. Cinnamon Raisin bagels. Garlic Bagels. Honey wheat bagels. Poppy seed bagels (obviously). Scallion cream cheese (as is often the case with a fine bagelry, you might want to ask them to go light on the schmear). Sandwiches (both breakfast and otherwise). Brewed coffee that doesn't taste like it came out of an unmentionable part of a dog.

A dozen of Poppy's finest may have found their way home with us after we finished our breakfast. And I may have eaten one every day this week. And I might have already marked on my calendar when we are going to run out so I can back and get more...maybe."}
{"text":"Absolutely nothing like a New York bagel, so if you've ever eaten one, don't go here. Rude service, disappointing bagels and the worst cream cheese I've had in a long time. Got my bagel toasted because I could tell they weren't gonna be good untoasted like a NY bagel and the terrible, greasy cream cheese literally melted and dripped off."}
{"text":"I had chicken salad on a croissant w/cheddar, lettuce & tomato.  it was decent but I'm used to my mom's w/grapes, so it was lacking a bit. still, it was exactly what I needed between breakfast and lunch timeframes, and how many places serve chicken salad. my only real complaint was the $8 price tag - for just the sandwich.

cute inside and if I was in the neighborhood again I would get a bagel, dessert or try a different salad.  I like to support small businesses and the guy I would've guessed was the owner, or at least the oldest employee I saw, was very nice. I'd recommend checking it out. :)"}
{"text":"The amount of gas I have used driving across town every weekend for these delicious, holey bread circles seems excessive, but then again, you can't call yourself the #bagelbaron if you're not willing to make some sacrifices."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about Poppy's over the last year and finally decided to make the trip today. Overall experience - it lived up the hype. As told by a friend, there is no need to go crazy here. Just like the key to a good sandwich, the X-factor to really setting it apart is good bread. I ended up getting a bacon, egg and cheese on poppy while my wife went with egg and bacon on an everything bagel. Definitely get the bagel toasted as it makes it a bit crispy on the outside and pulls the entire thing together. Also of the two bagels we got, we both agreed the everything bagel was better as it had a great hint of garlic that wasn't too overpowering. Certainly one of the best (if not the best) bagels in the city. 

They have a lot of other fun stuff here from pastas to blueberry muffins that all looked amazing. I'll have to come back and try more of the menu sometime. Also I will give them props for having a quick system. We waited in a long line, but it moved quickly. By the time I paid and was getting my coffee, our to-go bag was already ready. While Owen's still holds my heart when it comes to crazy bagel sandwiches, Poppy's is a solid alternate option that I will be visiting again very soon."}
{"text":"This place was extremely busy on a sunday afternoon and I can see why. The food is delicious. You cant go wrong- everything is good! Yummy breakfast sandwiches, bagels, homemade cream cheeses, yummy drinks. There was a man walking around cleaning tables etc. He was very friendly."}
{"text":"I've had way better bagels, for example: Brooklyn Water Bagel. I can say they have ok daily specials but other than that I wouldn't come back. Although the employees were pleasant."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a walk-in, non-pretentious breakfast spot with EXCELLENT food - Poppy's is the spot for you.

 I've been to Poppy's about 3-4 times now, and one thing's for sure - my weekday experiences are vastly different from my weekend visits.  Simply because the wait can be long and slightly chaotic on the weekends, I would either recommend going as early as possible or simply go on a weekday.

The big, meaty bagels are super tasty and filling (That's what SHE said - hehe).  I've also had the bacon-egg and cheese croissant a few times as well.  The super soft croissant its served on is like biting into a soft, buttery cloud.   I've only been here for breakfast, but this spot also seems like a great lunch option - with several made-to-order Paninis and gourmet soups and salads.

The service has always been great.  Everyone is super friendly and personable.  The inside of the establishment is always clean with plenty of natural lighting.  In addition to the limited seating scattered throughout, there's a small outdoor area with about 10 tables.  

If you are like me, and are a NY transplant and in constant search for delis and eateries that remind you of home - Poppy's is gonna do an excellent job of jogging your memory!"}
{"text":"Kind staff & tasty bagels. Would recommend it to anyone looking for authentic bagels & deli fare."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels! I had bagels and lox all the way, plus a few extra yummies for my mom. She loved it just as much as I did. She's from NJ and she said that they were just like the bagels she had as a kid. Love this place, definitely going back."}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, I'm always looking for a taste of home here in the south. Poppy's bagels are the most comparable to the bagels you'd find in the city!  Crispy outer shell and deliciously soft inside! As soon as you bite into one you can taste the difference.  They have a variety of fresh cream cheese flavors displayed as you'd seem them up north as well as an array of other products.  The service was excellent and welcoming.  Plus, when a bin looked out of a certain type of bagel, they had some freshly made in the back.  A welcome change from chain stores that run out of the 'everyhing' bagels by 11am. I became an instant fan.  Bye bye Breuggers, Hello Poppy's!  I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best bagels in Charlotte. I agree with previous posting that a simple bagel with butter is a bit pricey. My friend got a bagel sandwich, and it looked amazing. They have flavored coffee here, which was nice (raspberry chocolate).

I wouldn't go here as a regular, but for a special brunch, yes. 

ALSO: Do not sit in owner's chair. She will be upset."}
{"text":"Finally! A decent bagel that reminds me of home!!! NY :)
Such good breakfast and deli options, well priced and quick even with a crowd waiting.  I also had wonderfully sweet service amid the busy Sunday morning rush.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love Poppy's! I always get everything on a bagel, whether it's my breakfast sandwich or a deli sandwich! They have fantastic bagels and a fantastic staff!"}
{"text":"Hello best bagels in town! This place is usually packed out, but the line moves quickly. 
This is my go-to bagel fix, they have all the classics. Definitely just like a traditional New York bagel shop."}
{"text":"Dang... should I get that last piece of coffee cake in the display case??? Looks all moist and sweet. Nice thick crumble topping. Mmmmm...

Forgive me as a salivate over some of the things in the display case and jars.

My only gripe... bagels are sitting out in the open and I didn't really notice until I swatted a fruit fly away from my forehead. Is that sanitary??? 

They get points for friendliness and how much staff is in that joint. I was literally waiting for 5 seconds for my food. I swear I just ordered my food when all of a sudden I was handed my food. Nice job on getting people in and out! 

Okay but on to my bagel. I hate to give a harsh review but ummmm it's aight. It looks like this place is beloved by many and I get it. They do have more than just bagels, but I'm a fan of places who specialize in something AND do it right. 

Huuuu... why did I have to move away from \"The Original Brooklyn Water Bagel Co\" If you want a bagel done right, check that place out. It's in Ballantyne, but it just may be worth it for me to take a short ride out there. 

Okay really... on to my bagel...

It was decent. But I was looking for something more filling. And that I know that sounds ludicrous because it's bread, but I mean I was looking for a thick slab of cream cheese, and thick hunk of tomato and like 3 piece of bacon. What I got was decent for $4. The flavor was good and the cream cheese was really good. It didn't taste like it was processed. My Onion bagel was pretty oniony and doughy. Surely didn't taste like it was frozen, but definitely a different taste from The OBWBC. 

I'll visit again. Only because it's the better alternative to my fave bagel spot and not too far from my job. Heck! I may also try that coffee cake I was starting at some other time."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit and this place is GREAT! The staff was very nice and service was quick. I had a breakfast sandwich that was awesome and brought home bagels to share with the hubby. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Friendly and fantastic service. Real NY bagels. Wonderful place!!! I highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an NYC bagel, look no further! This place is hands down the best bagel in CLT and they also offer a plethora of typical Jewish options, another clear sign of NYC deli. I can't wait to make this a staple of my visits down there from now on!"}
{"text":"Even though when I came in they were busy, I was served by friendly staff and everything was quick and efficient. The food was delicious!! Great spot for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Been to Poppy's on several occasions and at different times of the day. I can say that there is always a line but it moves quickly. I typically get \"The Works\" bagel without capers and some breakfast item (seasonally flavored pancakes, french toast, eggs with ham/bacon, etc) and have yet to be disappointed. So much more than bagels available at this authentic NY style deli.

The staff is pretty friendly, my fave is the gentleman at checkout. He always makes me laugh with his witty comments. Today, I tried their apricot and raspberry Rugelach...delicious! They also offer lots of beverages including coffee, tea, all sorts of juices, sodas and bottled water.

They have some indoor seating as well as some seating in the covered patio. They will call your name and bring your order to you so feel free to grab a seat. 

If you have never been there, this is how it works:
Find your place in line and try to decide what you want quickly as your turn will come sooner than expected. Give your order for everything except drinks and baked goods to the person behind the counter. You will be given a pink paper with your order. Take it to the register and tell the witty man what you want to drink or what baked goods you want to add to your order. He will tally everything up and charge you as well as give you cups for your hot beverages (if any) and serve you your baked goods (if any). Pay the nice man (remember to tip!), grab your beverage and have a seat while you wait for your order to be served.
Enjoy your delicious meal!"}
{"text":"Hello, new bagel place! Nice addition to the area. 

I love bagels and these did not let me down! The bagel was fresh, soft, and toasted to perfection. The specialty cream cheese is made fresh every morning. I picked the veggie spread and it was delicious! Talk about fresh pieces of bell pepper...yum!

I steered clear of the coffee based on the other reviews. Since my main goal was to eat a bagel during this stop, I didn't try much else on the menu. However, husband got a veggie omelet. It was very tasty and came with a buttered bagel on the side. They have about 3 or 4 other types of omelets on the menu, none of which are vegetarian, but you can make your own ($.50 per item, so it can add up quickly)...so goes the veggie lifestyle. They have a variety of bagel sandwich options too, which I will have to return to try.

If you are in need of some jewelry, they sell that too...nicely displayed on a wall. Random, yes, but you can kill a couple birds with one stone here!"}
{"text":"There are two good bagel spots in Charlotte and this is one of them.  Gotta hit it on the off peak hours though, Saturday morning is a little bit of a zoo with the line.  Great bagels though."}
{"text":"I finally tried Poppy's. I thought the bagels were fresh and flavorful. However, the true test would be what my native New Yorker (and highly picky) parents think. My parents know their bagels and their pizza and their sandwiches but that's the makings of another review. I took my parents home a variety: bagels, knishes, whitefish, potato salad, smoked salmon cream cheese and rugelach pastries.

Success! 

I loved that Poppy's sold 59 oz orange juices so I didn't have to run to the store to get my brunch fix. I would stop here again. I can't wait to try one of their bagel sandwiches and their other cream cheese varieties like jalapeno. Friendly service too to boot even though it was a busy Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place! Loved the bagels, the cream cheese and everything else they serve. You can get grits, eggs, breakfast potato and a number of different salads. I would recommend getting takeout and there is a very small dining room that fills up quickly. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Compared to Einstein's or Bruegger's, Poppy's has the edge in quality and variety. At least a dozen different types of bagels, and too many flavors of cream cheese to count. The bagels are usually very fresh, and so far none of the cheese's I've had have been bland. First timers can't go wrong with the jalapeño cheese and a plain bagel, but I suggest the tuna salad on an asiago cheese bagel if you want to go all out. They have great lunch items too that change regularly, and when they have them, the potato pancakes definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"First time visitor today...we had to take our order to go, and both of bagel sandwiches were missing cheese. Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Being from NY I know a good bagel. This place has the best bagels I've had since moving down south. Their food and customer service is top notch."}
{"text":"I'd tried this place once before and thought it was just ok. Today I had a Jewish deli craving (RIP Katz NY in Arboretum) and figured this was all Charlotte had to offer. Ordered a lox & cream cheese bagel with the works on an Asiago bagel & a small coffee. The line was super long & the small dining area was spilling over with people but my sandwich still managed to come out quickly. I poured my hazelnut coffee w half & half & took my order to go. The coffee was great. The sandwich was decent. I ended up pulling the onion, salmon & tomato off and just marveling at how amazing the bagel was. A thin, nutty outer crust & a dense chewy inside. Heavenly. Next time I'll keep it simple. But those bagels are on my must have list now!"}
{"text":"Just average for me, but maybe it was an off day.  When my husband and I arrived (10:30am on a Saturday) the line was long and the place was packed. Always a good sign! I was pretty surprised to not see a list of bagel sandwiches on the menu. I was thinking it would be similar to Owen's bagels, which I love- it wasn't. I only saw a handful of basic breakfast bagel sandwiches (egg, cheese, meat or cream cheese). The rest of the menu consisted of deli sides and sandwiches on bread or ciabatta.  

I got the basic egg, cheese and turkey sausage on an everything bagel (tasted). My husband got the chicken mozzarella sandwich on ciabatta. We waited about 10 minutes and bam our food was served. At first glance my bagel sandwich looked delicious. I bit into it and it was hard and somewhat burnt. Tasted stale. I look the top of my bagel off to only see a turkey patty literally 1/3 the size of the bagel and the egg was super thin. I could barely taste it. I took the top off to eat the rest. I'm not sure if it was because I got my bagel toasted or what, but it didn't taste good nor was soft on the inside like the other reviews. My husband's on the other hand was delicious and I would get that again hands down. Maybe I should of stuck with a basic bagel (not toasted) with their homemade cream cheese.....there's always next time. 

I would go back and try Poppy's again because I think they deserve another try, but I'm not in any rush to go back soon."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite bagel stop in Charlotte.  We got a dozen for $10.  Plus they have several varieties of cream cheese deliciousness.  I love the way the bagels are just the right balance of crunchy crispy on the outside and soft chewiness on the inside."}
{"text":"I was feeling hungry and choose to forego my usual bagel choice and go big with a bacon and egg on an everything bagel. It was good, but wasn't blow-you-away good. Honestly, Poppy's has great bagels, but they didn't wow me with the sandwich. I recommend skipping the sammy and just going with a regular cream cheese bagel. They have a huge selection of flavored coffee, but it's pretty base line. It's a small business so can get crowded inside and the only view of the menu is right when you're up to order, which can be overwhelming on a busy Saturday morning. The patio area is nice, covered with fan, but still can be HOT on a warm Charlotte summer day. I was also a little surprised by their \"iced coffee\" selection. I picked up the picture and found that the \"iced coffee\" was super hot, like they'd just brewed it and were waiting for it to cool down or just be poured over ice. Honestly, it's a pet peeve of mine when people offer iced coffee that's really just regular coffee to be poured over ice. Don't offer it if you can't get it right. A customer would rather order something else then have something that is sub-par. Overall, the experience was average, I wouldn't rush back there if I'm visiting the area, but as a local I could see myself grabbing a bagel to go."}
{"text":"Poppy's has the best bagels in Charlotte. They are notably bigger, fresher, & tastier than anywhere else. Since discovering Poppy's I won't get bagels anywhere else."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Real NYC deli food...minus the grossness (it is very clean inside).  I love my egg and cheese bagels.  THEIR BAGLES ROCK!  I call in my orders when I am on the way.  Yes, I have Poppy's bagel's number stored in my phone :)  Best bagels in Charlotte, hands down."}
{"text":"Stopped in during a visit from Charleston, SC.  Can't seem to find a decent bagel in Charleston, but now I need Poppy's to open a location in Charleston.  Got a bagel sandwich with butter and had to go back to bring a dozen home.  They were that amazing!  Can't wait for my next visit to Charlotte so that I can stock up!"}
{"text":"What do you get when New York bankers move to Charlotte?
You get a ton of Yankees making CLT a New South city.
You get at least one place with authentically New York bagels (although they are still working on the pizza here).

Big, chewy New York-style bagels. New Yorkers, you won't be dissatisfied, unless you get the cream cheese with lox. It's just bits of fish in cream cheese, not big, thin slices of fish, and no capers and the rest.

As for me, I go with the nontraditional bacon, egg and cheese toasted on an onion bagel. Boom. I'm done.

The coffee is HOT here, they sell newspapers, and you can sit inside or outside. There are parents and kids EVERYWHERE. It is Charlotte, after all."}
{"text":"3.759- I know people love this place, but I think it's \" just ok.\" While they give you a lot of cream cheese and the Salmon Spread has decent chunks of salmon in it, I don't think it's worth the money. I also don't think the cream cheese/food has enough flavor. My capers weren't salty... That's why I get capers. At any rate, try it! You might like it. Until next time I'm going to add some salt and pepper to my bagel, make some coffee and have a good day! You do the same!"}
{"text":"This morning I woke up craving a ham, egg and cheese bagel. Being from New York originally this is a difficult task to find a good bagel place... I choose poppy's based on the previous reviews and I'm glad I did. It is delicious! The bagel was toasted just right, cheese was melted, ham was heated, eggs were fluffy! I'm in love. I found my bagel joint and I couldn't be happier"}
{"text":"I LOVE POPPY'S BAGELS.

When I moved to Charlotte last year, I left behind an amazing little coffee shop with fantastic breakfast sandwiches.  I was homesick for a good bacon, egg and cheese bagel sandwich.  I longed for the perfect bagel, that one fills you up, but doesn't make you feel too full of bread.  Then I found Poppy's, and the bagel hole in my stomach was filled again.

Poppy's is a fantastic, friendly NY bagel shop.  They have all sorts of flavors of bagels, and stock them well into the afternoon - even if you go in right before they close at 3pm, you'll probably be able to get a sandwich on your choice of bagel.  The bacon is always great and not too soggy.  And they'll make you egg white sandwiches too.   They are quick, and always greet you like you're a regular - no matter how long it's been since your last bagel.  

I have been hoping that Poppy's will find its way down to the Ballantyne area, but for now it remains my \"on my way up-town\" luxury.  

Oh!  And they have a credit/debit minimum.  So if you're not going to spend $5, be sure to have cash."}
{"text":"Yankees.....hear ye, hear ye! For all my fellow northerners who've been searching for a genuine NY-style bagel shop this side of the mason dixon, you have a very viable option with Poppy's!!

I learned of this place thanks to my trusty Yelp and then instantly bookmarked it thanks to Candyce B's review. I showed up this morning around 10:30 and there was a line that only continued to grow as I waited. Poppy's is small on the inside space so things can get a little cramped as you try to make your way around.

Poppy's offers homemade, kettle boiled bagels. This fact is important because it's one of the things that distinguishes these bagels from the rock solid ones found at Panera and the like. The selection this morning included honey wheat, salt, plain, pumpernickel, everything, and a couple more that I cannot remember. They also have homemade cream cheese available in a handful of flavors. Besides the typical bagel shop offerings, they also serve eggs benedict, omelets, pasta and potato salads, and soup. Again, all homemade in the store. 

I ordered the breakfast special: bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel with a small coffee. I got mine on an everything bagel. You order and pay at the counter and then they call and bring out your order (if it's something that's cooked/prepared) on the side. This was my first time having an everything bagel and? IT WAS EVERYTHING. The bagel was soft and chewy with a light crisp and the flavors didn't overpower the bacon and egg. I had always steered away from everything bagels because I was afraid of the onion/garlic being too overwhelming but this one wasn't. The coffee is serve yourself style and they had french vanilla, hazelnut, dark roast, original, chocolate raspberry flavors alongside skim milk, milk and half and half options. 

Poppy's was/is delicious and I'll be back as much as I can when I pass through the area."}
{"text":"I don't know how you do it, but you continue to amaze me. 

Terrific variety and it's all really well done. Bagels are the best in town, salad selections haven't missed yet (eating chicken salad right now I took to go).  Other breakfast items are a treat too (example: coffee cake imported from New York)"}
{"text":"Maybe their other food is good, but certainly not their bagels.

Service: people were nice, but not really doing anything. More people \"working\" than there were customers in the store, and they still managed to put a guys soup to go in the bag upside down.

The Bagel: Not.Even.Toasted. Thick and lacking flavor. Not much pork roll or egg on the sandwich, but they put ample Kraft singles cheese on it. Real \"high quality.\"

Owen's in South End isn't the best bagel I've had, but please either get one there or save yourself $4.59."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here on a Sunday late morning, and it there was definitely a large crowd of people. We ordered the bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant, but unfortunately because of our late time, they were out of croissants, so we opted for it on bagels instead. We also ordered a small side dish of pasta salad that looked amazing from the display case - and it was. Our brunch was absolutely delicious! And those were the simple things on the menu - there is so much to choose from and tons of options. Our food also came out rather quickly for being such a busy place at that time. I would absolutely recommend this place, and I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Poppy's has the best bagels in Charlotte. Period. The bagels have a great crunch on the outside, and are soft on the inside. They taste just like a New York bagel. Sesame, plain, everything, and egg are all delicious.

Not only do they have excellent bagels, but they also have great homemade cream cheese. The chocolate chip cream cheese is delicious--I ate a quarter of a pound of it on matzos in one sitting. Probably not the greatest idea, but it was delicious.

The location is very good--the shopping centeris nice, and parking is plentiful. I wish it was a little bit closer to our house--I'd stop for an early morning bagel once in awhile. 

Service is good--really no problems to complain about. They're always extremely busy, so if you're planning to eat there, you may not always get a table."}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love.

Growing up in Chicago, I had a plethora of non-chain type bagel joints to choose from. True, legit, REAL bagels... Not those things that Einstein's, Panera, DD and the like, try and pass off as a bagel. Poppy's delivers a great bagel that satisfies all the requirements. Perfect amount of chew, not hard, not dry, not bready, good flavor... Awesome. 

The bagels are great, prices are good, friendly service. I just wish they were closer to the Southend! I can't wait to go back and try their matzoh ball soup!! Yum :)"}
{"text":"I love a good bagel place. I just recently
moved into town & it was one of the first things I looked for. Poppy's does not disappoint. I got two bagels to go, a blt on a salt bagel and an everything bagel with cream cheese for a friend. We loved them. I am always wary about ordering bacon at restaurants because I cannot stomach the weird, limp stuff. I'm glad I decided to go for it, though, because this bacon was perfect & crisp and they didn't skimp. The bagels themselves were perfect and just a little chewy, just how I like them!"}
{"text":"As a northerner, I believe we stand as natural critics to bagels everywhere. Poppy's definitely stands as the best bagels that I can find in Charlotte. The staff is super friendly, the ingredients are all super fresh and the bagels have the right amount of crunch and chew to satiate any northerner looking to get their bagel and shmeer fix. They even have a whitefish salad and potato pancakes, yum! I personally have their Waldorf chicken salad on an everything bagel that is the best lunch any day."}
{"text":"Best bagels in town, hands down. Everyone knows it too, which is why on a Saturday or Sunday morning the line can be VERY long. The staff is great about keeping it moving. Been regulars for years, staff recognizes us and makes us feel welcome, even when busy. Would love to see their new text to order rolled out on weekends to combat the lines."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday morning at about 9:30AM. I had pretty low expectations given we are in NC, but I was really pleasantly surprised! 

The line was serpentined round the store I couldn't believe it! We quickly learned that you could text your order in for pick up. So as we stood in line we texted our order in.   

We got bagels with cream cheese and a BEC (Bacon, egg, and cheese). It was great! 

The bagels are chewy on the inside and crisp on the outside. The cream cheese was very fresh. 

I look forward to ordering salads and cookies in the future.

There is very little seating inside. So best to take it to go!!"}
{"text":"Easily the best bagel place I've been to in Charlotte.

I was spoiled growing up. My grandma would bring down a suitcase full of bagels from Montreal when she would visit. They are in my opinion the best bagels in the world. New York bagels are close second and that is definitely the influence of this place.
They provide a wide variety of bagels and make both breakfast and lunch sandwiches out of them.

My only problem with this place is they offer a ton of other delicious looking stuff I want to try from their deli and desert counters but because I can only get over there on rare chances, I stay true to my cravings for bagels. Some day I'll try a Blintz or their pasta salad or some of their other deserts. I've also been told I must try their croissants.

The staff is always friendly and the line moves pretty quickly.

I should be thankful there is not a location that is conveniently closer to me because it would be hard to stay away from it, and with so many offerings, it would take long while before I'd get bored of it."}
{"text":"This has become my go-to place to pick-up bagels for playgroup, school functions, Sunday morning after church, out of town guests - you name it, it works. These are the only bagels we have had here in Charlotte that actually taste like New York bagels. They are incredible! I would give it five stars were it not for the grumpy service I have received during post-church rush hour. Alas, everybody has a bad day and perhaps this gentleman was so excited to see the line out the door, that he forgot to be pleasant to his coworkers and customers. 

I am not a fan of putting sandwich fixings inside a bagel so I cannot speak to lunch options but they do look good! (Not to be a buzzkill, but do you know how many calories are in a plain bagel? The New York Times once did a story on NY bagels and found that the calories per bagel - no cream cheese - ranged from 380 to 800 dependent on the size. Yikes!) I prefer to keep my bagels plain and simple - simple like chocolate chip cream cheese. Yes, I did say chocolate chip cream cheese. And I will confess that I have ordered a bagel (just one) so I could validate the purchase of a small tub of chocolate chip cream cheese - pay for it by weight. 

Check out Poppy's Bagels - and definitely try the chocolate chip cream cheese. Yum."}
{"text":"We ended up at Poppy's Bagels on a whim.... Passing through Elizabeth and hit up Yelp for a breakfast suggestion.  So many Yelpers had good opinions so we decided to see what it was all about.

There was a big line to greet us, but there were plenty of employees so the line was moving at a pretty good pace.  They had a good size breakfast and lunch menu including bagel sandwiches of all kinds (Boars Head for lunch meat).  They also had around 10 varieties of different cream cheeses for bagel toppings.  As far as bagel flavors there was probably around 15 different ones.  I choose everything with light veggie cream cheese, hubby got a sausage egg and cheese on multigrain.  The bagels are really big!  I grew up in NY with good bagels and these were close but more \"bready\" than a bagel from Brueggers just as a comparison.

Prices were moderate for bagels- my cream cheese was $2.79 and my husband's was $4.99.  Not cheap but they were a good size.  We may go back if in the area but I wouldn't say I'm in love.  What did look good was all of the lunch salad/side options.  They were rocking the deli choices for sure.  I may have to try lunch."}
{"text":"Poppy's bagels are good but good can only go so far when you feel like you get pooped on week after week by their horrible customer service. 
 I constantly try to give them a chance and today's experience was the last one. I walked into Poppy's today at exactly 12:45pm and noticed a sign that said they were closing early at 1pm in \"observance of the Panthers game\". Okay, understandable if that's how you want to run your restaurant- since I'm taking this to go, walking in 15 minutes before you close should be acceptable. Plus the place was still fairly busy with customers that were eating and waiting for their bagels. Nonetheless, I stood in line to be ignored for the next 5 minutes. Not even a \"we will be right with you\" as they had their backs to me clearly more concerned with cleaning up everything before they closed. 
At 12:50 I was finally acknowledged (and now there was a line behind me of customers that had arrived after me) and I attempted to order my usual egg bacon and cheese. The lovely gent that took my order rolled his eyes and huffed and puffed and told me the grill was closed because they were closing at 1. I pulled out my phone just to make sure I wasn't crazy, and I gave him a bewildered look like .... OKAY and your point ? Thats 10 mins away and I'm asking you to make me an EGG. You run a restaurant, and you're willingly turning away business. Sure dude. we have a restaurant of our own and unfortunately people walk in close to when you're closing, it's the name of the game. But you put a smile on and you do your job-or else get out of the restaurant industry. 

Regardless of how good your food is, if your customer service sucks and you run a lazy staff and restaurant, you don't deserve my business.
And based on their sanitation score (90) and details that can be found online, you can tell its pure laziness. I have no respect for that."}
{"text":"Great bagels, but, the true star is the cream cheese. So many choices! Get the everything bagel with jalapeño cream cheese. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"This is like a little NY deli. Bagels are delicious. I like to get mine toasted. Friendly small business service!"}
{"text":"Poppy's is definitely a place you want to visit if you're looking for really fresh bagels. I visited one morning last week, and of course they were very busy, but they were also very fast! They had a breakfast special for less than $6 that included a bacon, egg and cheese bagel plus a drink. I sampled the Chocolate Raspberry coffee which was really good. I also sampled the blueberry bagel which was delicious. Under the glass counter they also have different salads ( tuna, chicken, etc) , if you're looking for a lunch option ."}
{"text":"Delicious bagels, friendly service and low prices!
My favorite is the breakfast sandwich, but they also have a wide variety of homemade cream cheese if that is more of your speed. They also have soups, salads, and lox, so similar options to Jewish delis that I have been to in NJ.
I'm a big garlic fan, so I always get their garlic bagel. It's covered (covered!) in minced garlic, which is great. You may not be able to breathe on anyone afterwards, but it is so garlicky and tasty.
My family is from NJ, so I always get the Taylor Ham which I was so excited that they have here. If you don't know what Taylor Ham is, you should definitely try it once. It looks similar to Canadian Bacon, tastes kinda like fried bologna and is sweet and sour. I can't do it justice, but it is a treat in the breakfast sandwich. I think they skimp a little bit on the meat, so I always ask for double Taylor Ham.
Like others said, Poppy's can get crazy on the weekend. The parking lot is sufficient (most of the time) but it can be very difficult to find spots if you happen to coincide with classes at Flywheel, which is in the same shopping center. They do a good job of managing the line though so you don't feel like the service is slow.

Overall, it's a great, relatively quick and cheap breakfast choice."}
{"text":"A New York bagel shop in the middle of Charlotte. Awesome bagels, terrific fresh whitefish and other delicacies. Bacon, egg and cheese on an everything bagel is the way to go."}
{"text":"Best bagels in CLT hands down. I've been here many times over the past several years- great family deli."}
{"text":"By far the BEST bagels in Charlotte. Forget Owen's, this place is the real deal.

The owners, originally from Hungary (?), are extremely warm and friendly. Standing in line and looking at the variety of traditionally Jewish dishes, like noodle kugel, latkes, and rugelach, make me momentarily forget that I'm in Charlotte and transport me to LA or NY...that is, until the person behind me complains about how gross lox on a bagel would be. 

Regardless, these bagels are always fresh and delicious. Large variety of schmears. This place is, in a word, amazing. THANK YOU POPPY'S."}
{"text":"I love sandwiches. It was such a good idea to put stuff between bread... but then the bagel sandwich. If I would marry a food it would probably be a bagel sandwich. Breakfast is like the only resin to get up in the morning right? And then you take it into lunch?!?!?!? WINNING! And this place is doing it professional style. Here's the thing. I ate the chicken salad on a toasted everything bagel and I feel different about life. Like I could do anything when I eat the bagel sandwich - and I can! The salad in the cold case are all beautiful looking too! I have only had a few but they are all the bees knees!

The coffee is nothing to write home about - so skip that - but the soda case has some fun stuff in it. And take home a half dozen or so bagels so that you can have a yummy breakfast on the go for the next week. As a New Yorker I would like to say thank you on behalf of the northerners here in Charlotte. It's a taste of home!"}
{"text":"Not the New stork style bagels I had hope for, but still good. More bready, less glossy, and less chewy than NYC bagels IMHO.

Stood in a long line on a Sunday afternoon trying to buy a dozen bagels. Not really set up for selling bagels by the dozen. There were tons of people behind the counter making bagel sandwiches to order, which seems to be the primary focus of the store.

I liked it enough to come back. Hopefully I can try a lox, cream cheese bagel with all the trimmings. I bet it will be good.

Side note...the staff seem quite pleased to spend time with each other, which is a good sign. Happy food preparers hopefully follow the health rules and a re proud of their work. They just did not seem as interested in the customers. I have been spoiled by the customer focus that other Charlotte businesses have."}
{"text":"Let me first off the say I heard this place is incredible. I was very excited to try this place out. I took our dog with us just to get an order to go I was met immediately at the door and was told very nasty no dogs you must tie him up outside if you going to come in here. I will never go back here and everyone I talk to I will not recommend this place.

Fyi to management you may want to train your employees that service dogs are allowed everywhere. Our dog is not a service dog but the gentleman that told me this had no clue if he was or was not and didn't even ask."}
{"text":"So thankful to find Poppy's! I almost had to pack up and move back to NY during one weekend bagel craving. But then - Poppy's..... :)"}
{"text":"Oh, Hello New York Bagel Shop in Charlotte!  If there is one thing I miss about living in NYC, it's the bagels.  I've been on the hunt for a good bagel shop for a while now that I've been living in the South for a few years.  Good biscuits - easy to find; Good bagels - and impossibly task.  Until one day after my spin class, I wandered into Poppy's.

I had a ham/egg/cheese on a bagel, which was super fresh and made that morning.  They even scooped out the bagel for me so I wouldn't eat so much of the bread!!!  So accommodating.  I've been back a few times just to get a variety of a dozen bagels an some cream cheese.  They have a few other deli sides you can get by the 1/4, 1/2 or 1lb container.

Warning, if you want to go on the weekend, GO EARLY.  The line can be insane starting around 9:30am.  Goes somewhat quick though, because they are fully staffed to deal with the morning rush.  There must have been about 25 people in front of me, and I was ordering within 10-15 minutes.  This place is now a carbolicious regular for me, and I'm so happy to be eating some yummy NY style bagels again that taste good!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the best Bagels in Charlotte, although pricey at $11 a dozen and there appears to be a problem with consistancy as some days the Bagels are better than other days. The problem is the indifference of the counter people who seem to think that serving the in-house customers is of secondary importance to talking on the phone or with each other, or attending to chores, which while necessary, could be done AFTER taking care of customers. The Bagels are great and large enough that they won't fit in your average toaster, so they are worth the $11 price tag. Work on your bedside manner folks!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Charlotte. I love getting a plain bagel with turkey and cheddar cheese on the grill  my FAVORITE."}
{"text":"Surprised to find such a great spot that's very unassuming. The breakfast special is great. It's bacon egg and cheese on a bagel with a cup of coffee. The bagel was great the bacon egg and cheese part was excellent. They have iced coffee which is a nice touch and people working there seem pretty nice too"}
{"text":"Poppy's is almost always packed - normally I am a reservation/appointment/assigned seating advocate but in this case, it's worth rolling the dice! I mean you can always take it to go, right? The freshly baked bagels make you wonder why you'd ever go anywhere else for a bagel. Definitely a favorite - plus we love the outside seating option for nice weekend days"}
{"text":"Had the salmon w/ jalapeño cream cheese on an Asiago bagel & it was delicious! I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Best bagels in Charlotte! Great breakfast sandwiches and parking is easy. Very nice staff and can make your own iced coffee."}
{"text":"Rude ass place. I stood in line alone waiting for someone to take my order. No one acknowledged me. An older gentleman came in and someone quickly took his order. It was plenty of people swarming in behind the counter and it wasn't busy. I won't be back if that's how you treat customers."}
{"text":"Poppys is our favorite bagel place in Charlotte. Food is wonderful. They could benefit from a larger establishment. There have been a few times I pulled up and saw the line out the door and turned around to grab poppys bagels from Harris Teeter and make my own breakfast at home. Did you know Harris Teeter on East Blvd sells Poppy's bagels in the bakery, near the doughnuts?? Their bagels are the best in town!"}
{"text":"Great bagels, nice and chewy, comparable to New York. Best I've found in Charlotte. I love the asiago with scallion cream cheese and I've never wanted to try anything else."}
{"text":"Stopped in for bagels before we hit the pool and were very impressed. Awesome flavors of cream cheese and the bagels were so fresh. Adorable little shop that we will absolutely go back to. Good prices, good food, good experience."}
{"text":"Love this place. I would stop on my way to work when I was running late.  If you're gonna be late might as well get breakfast... thats my motto.  I love their BEC bagel so delicious even after reheating throughout the day.  They have such a variety of cream cheese spreads I never seen anything like it.  To make it even more special, my hubby and I stopped here to grab a quick bite before heading off on our honeymoon.  He loved it! We split a bagel with lox and cream cheese it was delicious and was perfect to split since we're both a little lactose intolerant.  Everyone is so friendly here.  I love it, definitely a must try, think Panera, but actually worth the calories."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Poppy's! You can get coupon inserts and the best bagels in Charlotte in one place! I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This place has a five star reputation but this trip it gave a four star experience.  First off, if it's the weekend, expect to wait in a super long line.  You would think that would be a good sign and yes it normally is, this day they were struggling to keep hot food coming out so order something cold.  That's what did, unfortunately my wife and mother did not and theirs was a miss this trip.  We normally love this place and will be back soon.  Bagels are solid normally, the portion of smoked salmon on mine was very small compared to a typical NY deli but at only 7.99, half the price so I am ok with half the portion.  We will be back soon to give them another try."}
{"text":"The best bagel place I have found so far in Charlotte. The staff at Poppy's is so sweet! The bagel was fresh and soft just like a good bagel should be! I tried the veggie cream cheese and it was excellent. Poppy's reminds me of my favorite bagel shop back home. Only wish it was bigger and not quite so crowded. I will be headed back soon to try more on their menu because everything looked delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The lines here move quickly and the service is stone-faced and efficient.  Oh, and the bagels are really really good!

By far the beat bagel I've had here in Charlotte since I've moved from NEW YORK!

Their bagels have the perfect crunch/texture on the outside and perfectly soft in the inside. 

If you're in the area, definitely stop in!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go! I'm new in town and was looking for a good location to start my work day i.e. Eat a yummy breakfast and read emails and this was it! The staff answered all of my questions even when I asked what pumpernickel tasted like. Then after I paid he gave me one to try! I will definitely come back and encourage others to come as well!"}
{"text":"Best bagels ever and the egg salad is amazing. If you like lox, this is the place to go"}
{"text":"Fast, fresh cute breakfast/lunch spot. My husband and I went and saw there was a line but it went through it quick. Fresh warm bagels and the fresh foods in the case looks amazing will definitely be back for the chicken salad. Pastries looked delicious Coffee was fresh and prices decent. Will be back and lucky enough for us it's close to our house!"}
{"text":"I used to live in Charlotte, NC & I remember when this placed first opened. My family & I always came here because we are from NY and they had the best bagels. My sisters and niece still live there & I travel back and forth at least twice a month!! I will no longer be going there and either will my family ....The lady owner or manager not sure what she was hung up on me and offended me pretty bad. 

In 2015 I was diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (when your white blood cells attack your esophagus due to food allergies). I can no longer eat DAIRY or WHEAT.  She literally could care less about gluten free people because \"they make too much money\" and also \"they make fresh bagels\".  She wouldn't even let me come in to drop off a FREE sample of \"NY STYLE\" Gluten Free frozen bagels (comes in every flavor) that a lot of NY bagel shops have in the EC.

People who are not gluten free don't understand what it is like to be turned away. Your customers should come first AlWAYS & not be hung up on.  It's not possible to make fresh gluten free bagels and fresh regular bagels (cross contamination). So the best next option is Frozen (if you are gluten free you could relate to me as long as we can eat it we don't care if it's fresh or frozen).

Anyway, I'm offended, hurt and was highly mistreated. 

Just a quick fact....

{"text":"We've been dying to try Poppy's for a while now as we've watched the great reviews pour in... Finally made it in the Saturday after Christmas and were met with a bustling, noisy crowd and a long line. Don't let the crowd fool you... It took us less than 10 minutes to order and find a table. 

We had the breakfast sandwiches -- bacon, egg and cheese for me, sausage egg and cheese for him. Both on an everything bagel. Both AMAZING! The bagels had a great crunch but we're still soft inside. The fillings were fresh, flavorful and hot. We also tried a scone because I read a few good things in reviews here. The scone was just average; I've had better and worse. Next time (and, oh there will be a lot of next times!) we'll stick with what I'm pretty sure they do best... Bagels!! We're also looking forward to trying the homemade cream cheese. I spotted someone with blueberry cream cheese and might have drooled a little bit."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I've only had the breakfast bagel sandwiches here, which are fantastic. My fiancé has tried the Ruben and said it was great (didn't beat Eddie's Place though!). If you typically go to Owen's Bagels, you will realize that the texture of the bagels at Poppy's are quite different.  Owen's has more of a chewy texture, in my opinion. The coffee cake was amazing, too! So delicious... I wish I had a piece right now!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OK- I think these are officially the best bagels in Charlotte.

They are no New York bagels. Go into it with that understanding. However, they are delicious and the closest thing to NY bagels in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great little bagel shop, a bit of a pain to get to with the busy road next to it. The dinning  room is cramped but there are chairs outside. Like others have said the staff is efficient and all business. No chatty workers here. But the bagels are top notch and the service is quick even when busy. I would come back for sure because the food was so good. The coffee ain't half bad either. Try the NY Lox on an Everything bagel it's great!"}
{"text":"Decent food, cute atmosphere. Really busy on Sunday morning but they did a good job getting everyone through quickly."}
{"text":"I can't remember what bagel I had, but I think it had cheese on it. The bagel and the cream cheese were the best I've had. Also tried their iced coffee which was good. Would return!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. Best noodle kugel in town and the bagels are legit. Long lines always move unbelievably fast. No charge cards under $5 FYI. Chicken salad is also very good. The now covered outdoor seating is a bonus."}
{"text":"Walking in the line was wrapped around the restaurant. The atmosphere reminds me of a New York bagel shop and actually moved pretty fast. We had our bagels about 20 minutes later.

I got the bacon egg and cream cheese everything bagel.  It was delicious and filling.  

Poppy's has Monday-Friday B.E.C. With coffee for less than $6.  There are also low fat options.  

Next time I will probably do call ahead to avoid the line."}
{"text":"Poppy's Bagel's is definitely worth the stop!

I'm loving it.  They really did have great bagels.  Great crisp outside, soft doughy inside.  This place was recommended to me by another Yelper and I'm glad she did.

I had to battle some traffic to get there but it was worth the wait and made for an excellent breakfast.  They have an excellent assortment of cream cheeses and a large inventory of bagels.  Line was short so it didn't take forever.  

I wasn't a fan of the coffee, but the bagel made up for it!  I ordered for my team at work and we had everything bagels with plain cream cheese and blueberry bagels with blueberry cream cheese."}
{"text":"Bagels are delicious! The everything bagel had so much flavor. I stuck with the basic bacon, egg and cheese for my first visit, but they had a lot of sandwiches and bagels that sounded really interesting. Was not impressed with the latkes. Ours weren't heated all the way and were just kind of dense and bland. They were really busy during Sunday brunch time!! Would stop by again while in the area, but now we know not to try and get there from Uptown during the time all the churches let out. The whole area gets packed!"}
{"text":"What this world needs are more joints with good bagels, because as it stands now, we have to drive a good ways to get one.  Sure, there are options, but they are so far away.

Unlike Andy, who has to merely walk across the parking lot (an adventure in itself, I am sure), we are a good bit away from Poppy's, which is a shame, as they have some nice offerings.  Thinking on it, it is probably a good thing, since if I were closer, I would probably be popping out of my pants if I ate here as much as I wanted.

Though they are maybe not the friendliest - having to get through a line of Charlotteans wanting their bagel fix will do that to you - they serve up a good bagel quickly certainly and that is about all that matters, right?"}
{"text":"Memorial day breakfast, homemade everything bagel and egg bagel all the way with lox, cream cheese , red onion & capers. Bagels were perfectly toasted, nicely constructed sandwich, fresh and delicious as always."}
{"text":"I have to say that I came to Poppy's with high expectations based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews but left disappointed. After taking a quick look at the menu, I decided that a bagel breakfast sandwich sounded good and for $4.50 was a decent deal, so I went for the ham, egg, and cheese on an everything bagel. They had a number of side salads including potato salad, pasta salads, and various vegetable mixes but I figured a bagel sandwich would be enough for today and stuck with just that. (They also have some muffins, cookies, soups, paninis, other sandwiches, sodas, and a few different types of coffee).
The sandwich came out pretty quickly, especially since they cooked my egg to order, and the worker brought it right to my table which was nice. Upon first bite of the sandwich though I was hugely disappointed. The bagel was very dry and extremely chewy and dense, and did not taste all that fresh. I also realized very quickly that the bagel was way too large for the scant amount of toppings (2 very thin slices of ham, a small egg, and maybe a full slice of American cheese but it may have only been a half slice because it covered only half the bagel). I ended up eating the rest of the sandwich as one open faced half with the toppings and one half plain bagel, but it didn't improve things a lot.
I must say that the flavor of the everything bagel was really, really good. It had just the right amount of garlic and onion, and the seeds added a nice touch and didn't all fall off like they do at a lot of places. Unfortunately with the bagel being dry, it still wasn't very enjoyable. Maybe I'll come back to Poppy's to try a bagel with one of their cream cheese options and hope that the flavor of this bagel rather than the freshness is truly how their bagels usually are."}
{"text":"Mmmm carbo-licious. 

I met the lovely Ms. Tonya P for a brief bagel this morning and 'twas delicious. Carby, crunchity toasted bagels (mmm sesame) and fab cream cheese. The schmear has to be homemade right? Because I dabbled in the chive and the vegetable - both were equally tasty. 

Inside Poppy's has a smattering of tables and a cute little patio outside where Riley (my pup) enjoyed some bagel bits off of the concrete. Tasty. Be aware that the patio can be quite noisy with the umpteen cars passing down Providence and Sharon Amity, but no worries, I had my bagel and great company. 

Next time I'm in the area, I'm definitely going to pop in and pay homage to Poppy's by indulging in a nice toasty bagel and a pound of cream cheese. Nice to know that there's another local bagel joint in CLT!"}
{"text":"Went to lunch with my wife and she was very happy with her Egg Salad on a Garlic Bagel. The bagels are great, which show the owner's NY roots. I got an Italian Sub. It was very good, the meat was fresh but it was pre-made, not hand sliced and in the deli-fridge so the bread was cold."}
{"text":"Bagel sandwiches are my favorite breakfast item and these do not disappoint! I absolutely love their bacon, egg, and cheese bagel sandwiches. The bagels are delicious and fresh too. Not too hard and not too soft. Additionally, the egg is cooked fresh on a griddle to order, not microwaved! Their coffee is pretty good too. I've always been impressed with how friendly the staff is no matter how busy it is there (and it's always busy because it's so popular)! Good news is that the lines always move fast and it never takes too long to get your food."}
{"text":"Best bagel place in town! I'm serious, this place is sooo good whether you just want a normal bagel with cream cheese or a super delicious bagel breakfast sandwich. I get myself a breakfast bagel almost every week...that's how good it is! I recommend the everything bagel because it adds so much flavor to whatever you get! I usually always get an everything bagel toasted with cream cheese, over medium/over easy (whatever I'm feeling that day) and sausage. Might sound a little weird at first but every person I've gotten to try this combo has loved it, although it can be a little messy but in my book messy usually means super good!"}
{"text":"Great bagels decent coffee. Guy up front who rings you up is always friendly. Fast for how busy they are on the weekends and during the week it's even better. Go to bagel/ breakfast spot on this side of town. Never had a bad experience"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time recently. I immediately regretted my decision when I saw the long line winding around the interior, but kudos to the staff for keeping things moving. The wait was much shorter than I anticipated, but it did feel kinda cramped in there with the line wrapping around.

I had an everything bagel, lightly toasted, with veggie cream cheese. It was massive and delicious. Loved the fresh bell pepper in the spread!

Since they have \"and More\" in their name, I probably shouldn't have been surprised, but they do have a ton of other offerings if you're not craving a bagel. I was particularly intrigued by the array of salads in the cold case, and I'll definitely make it a point to drop in for lunch sometime."}
{"text":"I had been eyeing Poppy's for a while now since I frequent Flywheel on a regular basis, and I finally gave in to the carb-loading temptation post-workout. Be prepared for a wait in the morning hours, but it was impressive to see how quickly the staff is able to move through orders. However, there were issues with my order that marred my experience. For some strange reason, when the employee called my name for me to grab my order, he realized that he had never prepared my order. Not sure what that was about. He quickly grabbed my two bagels and cream cheese to go, but neither were toasted (which I had asked) and one had the wrong flavor of cream cheese (plain, not the veggie that I had ordered). The bright point of the experience was the bagels themselves. I tried the asiago and grabbed a blueberry for my mister. Both were delicious! I would consider coming back despite my messed up order because they were that good. Also, it seems like they have daily specials listed up front. Be on the lookout for $4.99 bagel sandwich specials."}
{"text":"A little taste of New York and New Jersey in Charlotte! Perfect bagels, Taylor Ham, and an awesome cream cheese variety, this place is a must-try breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This place is very yummy, but pricey.  I think it is just too overpriced for what you are getting.  I find that extremely disappointing because I have never had bad food or service here. I will try it again sometime."}
{"text":"Time: 10am. Place: Poppy's. Impulse purchase: Bagels, doz. Intent: I get to play Bagel Fairy all day with a dozen of the best bagels in Charlotte.

I distributed my cache of carb thoughtfully, but thoroughly. And not before eating two in one sitting. Bagelbloat, yeesh.

Coffee was just OK but I honestly don't think they care much about anything except the bagatorial arts up in Poppy's and in that distinguished category, they get an A+. Sad to me that Bore's Head is what they have for slices and cheeses since that stuff is just nasty, but hey.

No more Bruegger's for me. No more terrorizing Owen. I get Poppy bagels, I eat Poppy bagels, I love Poppy bagels.

note - these suckers are such globs of gluten that they don't age very well - freeze 'em, if you must, instead of sitting 'em in the breadbox."}
{"text":"don't really review places much, but after catching a review on poppy's bagels i had to respond.  i'm a cook from the northeast, but have been living here for 20+ years.  we recently started getting our bagels from poppy's and i have to say that so far they are the best bagels i've had since living and working in food establishments here.  i haven't actually eaten there yet so i can't comment on the rest of their menu since their operating hours don't coincide with my working hours.  they close pretty early."}
{"text":"Usually have good experiences from Poppy's. Not today. Waited about a half an hour for an egg and cheese on an everything bagel. I got his burnt bagel with barely any seasoning."}
{"text":"Their bagels are super fresh!  Real New York style bagels.  My coworker grabs some on Fridays for our team at work, and we end up eating them for both breakfast and lunch. Their cream cheese is homemade, my favorite is the Veggie!  All their different bagels are good, but can't resist that Asiago cheese."}
{"text":"New York-like atmosphere. A lot of energy and the efficiency is excellent. It was crowded when we went, which was 12:30 on a Sunday. This is a positive sign. I always worry when a restaurant has few-to-no customers at peak times. 

As far as the bagels, one was soft and the others were more on the well done side. The toasted bagel was very good, and my wife really enjoyed the everything with vegetable cream cheese. On the other hand, we live in Huntersville and usually go to Bagel Bin. While Poppy's Bagels are good, we like Bagel Bin bagels more. We didn't try any sandwiches, soups, or salads at Poppy's Bagels, so keep that in mind. And a big positive for Poppy's Bagels is that their prices are better than Bagel Bin.

Overall, Poppy's Bagels is recommended. Since it's a long drive for us, we wouldn't go back unless in the area. But if you live nearby and like bagels, then you should probably check it out."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time, and still do like 1-4 times a month-- just not several times a week.

I need to mention that the bagels are DEFINITELY not the reason I'm only giving 3 stars. If I had only ever had the bagels, I would easily give Poppy's 5 stars. I LOVE the bagels. They're bigger than most places in the area, and the cream cheese doesn't taste overly sweet like other bagel shops where it tastes like powdered sugar was added to the cream cheese.

My biggest complaint is the cannoli. Specifically the filling. I have ordered over 40 cannoils from Poppy's over the span of a year and a half, and literally... not one single time has it been right. Sometimes there is a huge gap in the middle with no filling, sometimes there's just a line of filling and you can literally look right through the cannoli and see what's on the other side. Every time, I say \"Please make sure it's actually filled.\" I literally feel like it's overkill for me to have to say it. I was assured today that it would be completely filled. Guess what?! It wasn't. I've complained about this several times, and stopped getting cannolis because of this, and I was having a pregnancy craving today, and ONCE AGAIN the cannoli was basically empty. I'm tired of them telling me that you can't fill a cannoli all the way. You can. I lived in Italy and make cannolis at home. I have never had \"settling\" issues or gap issues. You have to spend more than 5 seconds to fill it! That's literally all you do-- you take a little more time, and boom, it's filled! I would LOVE to show the staff how to fill a cannoli, but apparently, they don't need my help. (Trust me, the do need my help.)"}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed with Poppy's. The line on a Sunday morning at 9:30 was out the door, so I had high hopes. The line moved fairly quickly, but it was just a cluster of confusion in the restaurant. 

We had two bacon, egg, and cheese bagels and felt they were remarkably average. They have 4 coffee options but none of the flavors were just standard blend medium roast - they had hazelnut, dark roast, French vanilla, and chocolate raspberry. Where was a standard flavor? 

Also the patio was extremely dirty - cigarette butts, ashes, and just general debris was scattered about. They need a broom and a power washer! 

Pro tip: Go to Owen's Bagel instead!"}
{"text":"I had the \"breakfast special\"...it is the bagel with an egg, bacon cheese and coffee for $5.50. I chose the honey wheat bagel but overall the breakfast didn't have much taste. Maybe it needed salt but was hoping for a good taste. The coffee is very good. However I can't give them 5 stars because of the taste. The service is good but it is conveyer belt style when you walk in. So if you're not ready, they can easily get the order of the person behind you....it happened. Yay. I might try it again though."}
{"text":"The bagels were good
The attitude of a lady who works behind the counter and yelled at my wife for no reason at all is another story
All she did was ask if she can get a refill on a fountain soda and this lady snapped on her as if she was committing a felony and told her she couldn't come in
Because of her attitude we won't be coming back and it ruined bed what could of been a pleasant dining experience 
A shame because the bagels were decent"}
{"text":"Being a new transplant to Charlotte, originally from NYC, I had to try it out. Definitely very New Yorky. Not as good as the bagels I'm used to, but definitely one of the best bagels in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Truly the tastiest bagels in this area!! Panera watch out! 

Clean area inside, but not much seating. Plan to take out. $11 for a dozen bagels. Freshest assortment of cream cheese. 

$5.49 bagel breakfast with coffee, Monday through Friday only. You get choice of bagel with egg, cheese, and meat choice. I get bacon or ham.  Simply delicious!"}
{"text":"THE BEST bagels in charlotte! Tried the pumpkin pie cream cheese for the 1st time last week and back for more today!"}
{"text":"Amazing bagels and an amazing staff. They go out of the way to make your bagel the best a bagel can be. I come eat here as often as I'm in the area. I would give them 10 stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"Really good local deli. I ordered your basic egg salad (on a whole grain bagel) and the matzo ball soup. I love soup in the winter, in the heat of the summer -- anytime (and Poppy's Matzo ball soup satisfies my soup-love). Poppy's is a cute little place that can easily be overlooked in a Cotswold shopping center if you don't know any different. 

Excellent lunch spot (some would say breakfast). I will certainly be back for more soup, bagels & bagel sandwiches. I also love the family feel of Poppy's -- placing it head and shoulders above the chains."}
{"text":"Stopped in there around 11:00 this morning and they were still making piping hot bagels! Being that I choose my carbs wisely, bagels is something that I eat about once or twice a year. While I do love them, I would rather use my cheat meal on another food item, preferably, dessert. 
Well, these were really good bagels with some delicious cream cheese. I always love to get a toasted onion bagel (with the center of the dough scooped out to cut carbs of course!) with veggie cream cheese. My son and daughter both got their cinnamon raisin bagel, one with plain cream cheese and the other with raisin walnut cream cheese. My husband got a bacon, egg, and cheese bagel. We also ordered a blueberry muffin as it was taunting us as we were paying. Everything was delicious. Yummy freshly made cream cheese spreads. Lots of fresh and crunchy vegetables in my veggie one. My daughter loved the raisin walnut cream cheese as it was sweet and flavorful. The plain was fluffy and creamy. Definitely a great place to stop in for breakfast or lunch. The counter was full of different kinds of salads- pasta, egg, tuna, chicken, shrimp. They had all kinds of amazing looking items in their case. I know that we will going back very soon to try their shrimp salad and blueberry blintzes."}
{"text":"seating might be an issue but prices are decent and the bagel with lox and cream cheese was great.  Too bad I forgot my left overs in my in-laws fridge when I returned home."}
{"text":"I can't go anywhere else for bagels after trying the ones here! They are seriously so delicious and fresh. I literally dream about these bagels. Cream cheeses are great too- asiago bagel/jalapeno cream cheese is my current go-to combo, but the scallion and plain cream cheeses and everything bagels are excellent too, as is the lox. They also have good coffee. It gets busy and they close at 3, so your best bet is to visit on weekdays and early (before they run out of the asiago bagels). Do yourself a favor and stop here next time you're in Cotswold."}
{"text":"Been a weekly customer for 5 years.  The bagels are excellent but the place is filthy.  The manager explained they are too busy to clean table tops & floors?  The current conditions will probably relieve some of the traffic and allow time for cleaning!"}
{"text":"Discovered Poppy's after mass at St. Gabriel's Church, I had the lox and bagel, capers, onions & it was delicious. I came back a few more times before heading back to StL. We were in town visiting family over Christmas."}
{"text":"Great bagels, homemade cream cheese and sandwiches, but steer clear of the pastries and ready made foods. We tried pastries two different times and the donut was the STALEST donut I've ever had. My daughter who never turns down sweets even refused it. We also got a cookie once and it was ROCK HARD. Shame on them for serving stale pastries. If you go, stick to their bagels and cc."}
{"text":"What a great bagel. The staff is friendly and they offer a wide variety of bagels, sandwiches, omelets, etc. The bagels are great, fresh, large, and sliced upon order. I ordered a everything bagel with egg, cheese, and turkey. It came out hot and was delicious! 
I look forward to returning to try a lunch sandwich."}
{"text":"Ok we LOVVEEEE this place. Yes the line is long on the weekends, its small, but its WORTH. I love the food the staff and the bagels I love  that I found a place that gives me my NYC  carb fix"}
{"text":"Wonderful bagel shop, a small place with lots of options!
I first thought this was just a simple bagel and coffee spot but after visiting here, I see there is more to this book than it's cover."}
{"text":"I agree with everyone who has said that these are the best bagels in Charlotte. As a former New Yorker myself, I know a good bagel. While the interesting flavors they offer at Panera and those other chains are... interesting... the stuff they have here at Poppy's is the real deal. Everything, Sesame, Pumpernickel, all the classic flavored bagels and they're all large and fresh and fluffy with the great chewy and crunchy bagel texture that they are supposed to have.

Tip: spend an extra buck and get the salmon spread on your toasted bagel.

It's probably not the sort of place where you sit around all day, like a Starbucks or Panera, but it's nice for a quiet coffee (good coffee, by the way!) and a friendly meet with your buddies. In the nicer weather, sit outside in the sun. No wifi."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place has such great ratings. The food is pretty good but the service is terrible. I just waited 20 minutes for four bagels with cream cheese. And it wasn't busy. Another woman asked the cashier about her order and got a really rude response. Not impressed."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a NY bagel, you've come to the right place. It's on my way to work and church, so I drive by 6 days a week. That, my friends, is trouble.

No frills. Bagels and bagel sandwiches are available, as well as myriad other items. I never stray from my standard order:

Blueberry bagel. Toasted. With butter.

It really makes mornings all the more bearable."}
{"text":"Excellent bagels. One of the best bagel shop/deli in Charlotte.  Really gives that NYC/NJ authentic experience. We love it when we are able to stop here."}
{"text":"Thank you Poppy's for being in Charlotte. A great bagel is easy to talk about but hard to find. Take a ride up Providence and you will be relieved to find that ever elusive great bagel, with wonderful people behind the counter. Even though we are still hoping for one in the Ballantyne area, Poppy's has become one of those places you are willing to drive a little father for. Try it, like it, love it. But not so much that all the seats are taken when I try to get in for lunch."}
{"text":"Great bagel!  Crunchy on the outside and soft inside.  I enjoyed an everything bagel with egg, turkey sausage and cheddar cheese.  The turkey sausage was not very good.  Had an artificial taste."}
{"text":"Poppy's is still the best place to get a bagel in Charlotte and people have noticed.  The last few times I have been there, on Sunday early afternoons, it has been a frustrating experience.  The line is a long maze, hard to fine the end, in the way of everyone entering or leaving the establishment, also blocking the coffee bar.

Poppy's, please fix the unorganized line and ordering process. How about another register or a real POS system? Please stop asking everyone if they want their bagel toasted.  It is a waste of time and an insult to your bagels.  They do not need to be toasted because they are already super fresh, still warm most of the time I get them.  You get bagels from Dunkin Donuts toasted because they taste like crap otherwise.  People are not used to getting Bagels of your quality and freshness and just assume getting the bagel toasted is the right thing to do.  If I was you I would hang a big sign up that says \"we do not toast our bagels, because fresh bagels do not need to be toasted\"."}
