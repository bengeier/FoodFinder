{"text":"I have been here twice so far and both times have been amazing! You can't go there without trying their burgers! Mario Kart (that's the name of one of their burgers) is my favourite! A big veal meatball in the middle with cheese and this amazing sauce on top. I can't remember what it's called but it was down right good!

My friend and I also tried the deep fried oreos and it was like heaven in your mouth. The oreos were warm and soft, topped with a sweet taste of dolce de leche. My mouth is watering just thinking about them"}
{"text":"Dropped in for the first time today ..had the big kahuna burger it was very well put together..
Great choices of beers and very friendly staff.
Will be back to try other burgers .."}
{"text":"I wouldn't normally spend $16 on a burger (the black and blue), but it was worth it. I'd put it above Burgers Priest and Works (although both of those are also great). Simply put, the best burger I've ever had. (My wife said something pretty close to that about her traditional with mushrooms and Swiss added.)"}
{"text":"I went there and I'll admit it's a really cool place on the inside as it was really well decorated. I got take out and that took 30 minutes, which is way too long to order out for lunch. I ordered the panko crusted chicken burger with sliced ham and melted cheese. From the description on the menu, it described the chicken patty as crispy and having sliced fried ham and cheese on top. Instead, I got this inch thick hockey puck with ground chicken and this thick cut ham inside and no cheese. It tasted awful. Their \"own 7 spice rub\" is over powering and makes the dried out \"bird-ger\" even worse. I also had to pay 2 dollars more to get onion rings instead of fries and they didn't even taste like onion rings. They had this weird tasting seasoning on them and it just made them taste unpleasant. The meal overall was so over seasoned and bad, I only ate half of it and then began to become ill shortly after that. (Nothing like puking at work to make your Friday.) The employees were great but wow the food sucks and was not worth 18 dollars. I only recommend going there for the patio and to have a couple of beers that's it."}
{"text":"Awesome food, best burger by far in the area.  Service was great and very friendly.  Best place to sit is at the chefs table at least the first time you go to see what you like and talk with the chef.   Beers on tap was a very solid list.  Lastly and most important is the quality of the meat, top notch and takes a farm to table approach."}
{"text":"Sorry ignore my last review was for Coras but for some reason ended up posted on Ground Burger Bar and Yelp won't let me delete it."}
{"text":"Great burgers! High quality ingredients! Loved this place. We were in town visiting and went there multiple times in 4 days."}
{"text":"The burgers here are SO GOOD!!! The only thing I would want more is a larger order of fries (both regular and sweet potato)- they come in a little basket and it's really not enough. Yes, it's dainty, but golly we want more fries please.

Also, the Charcuterie Board....$26 for thin slivers of meat and cheese, and 4 slivers of thin bread....NOT worth it!!"}
{"text":"Just finished dinner here and for a first time experience it was superb! Service was great, food was served hot and wait time for a table during peak hours on a Saturday night was pretty quick. 

The menu is creative and there are plenty of options that could cater to patrons looking for a carnivore's feast or healthier choices with items such as gluten free buns, lettuce wraps, turkey burgers, shrimp and crab burgers etc. Burgers are hot, fresh and delicious. 
Deep fried Oreos on the menu for dessert, need I say more!?!!? I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time tonight with my wife and kids! Atmosphere & service were amazing and the food was even better! I had the Bison burger and it was one of the best burgers I've ever had. My wife tried the Korean Kim Chee burger and I also tasted that and thought it was unique and delicious. Kids menu was classic and priced well. Great beer selection too. Overall great first impression. I will be back regularly for sure!


*** UPDATE.. 3rd trip to GBB and they have yet to disappoint. The owner told me about the Elk Burger special and I had to try it. 3 words - to die for. I got a sneak peek at the new items to come to the menu.. Can't wait to make my way through them all! Keep up the good work Ground!"}
{"text":"Probably the best burger I've ever had. 
Interesting decor, friendly staff, great craft beer selection.  it's located just off Newmarket's historic Main Street which allows for a pleasant stroll after dinner specially on a clear night."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and ate the signature burger. Wasn't to bad, I found it a touch on the small side."}
{"text":"Overpriced burgers, small size dishes. Burgers taste \"boring\". My wife had turkey and didn't like it. My son did not want to finish his burger.  I would recommend Works burgers. 
Waitress service wasn't friendly at all."}
{"text":"Had thE black and blue and it tasted really good. Easily one of the best out there. Jst became one of my fav places to eat... and drink. Great selections on tap."}
{"text":"Good burgers and great patio. The $5 caesars were delicious and the burger selections is pretty awesome. I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Service was great and very friendly. Burger was okay. I created my own.I like a very simple burger brioche beef burger with cheddar. Fries were crispy but cold and also over seasoned, the thyme flavour was very overpowering.

Overall a decent meal. Nothing to rave home about."}
{"text":"I have been to Ground Burger Bar a few times now and each time am equally as impressed. I have had the signature burger fully loaded and it is soo delicious. The meat is tender and cooked perfectly. The fries are some of the best i've had and the the seasoning on them is to die for, you don't need anything to dip them in. I have had a couple of dinners there with girlfriends and not one complaint from any of them, and we can all be a bit picky. I've tried the bird-ger as well and its just as delish. The menu has something to please anyone, it's not just burgers! (Great salads to choose from too!) and the kid's menu is ON POINT for my picky eaters, not to mention awesome prices. I would definitely recommend this to everyone and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Heard this place just opened not awhile ago so my friend and I decided to give it a try. The inside and outside of this restaurant is really nice, great atmosphere and comfy surroundings. They offered different choices of buns you can choose from which I really love. Their fries aren't that big of a portion but delicious. I gave \"The Crazy Korean\" burger a try and I did not regret it, I really recommend it! Overall, my meal was a total of $15 including tax and 15% tips which I think the prices are pretty fair."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in Aurora/Newmarket! Love the ambiance and servers were very friendly"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for lunch following a trip to Upper Canada Mall. Since it's called Ground Burger, it was obvious that we were going to order burgers!

My friend and I both ordered their signature burgers. Added cheddar and bacon to mine on a brioche bun. SO good. The meat was grilled to perfection and very juicy. I also got a house salad as a side which had a nice vinegerette dressing and had chickpeas too! They provided us with condiments for the burger but it wasn't necessary. 

We ordered pop for drinks, and the root beer was waaaay too sweet. Other than that, great food and great service."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant was amazing! 

I ordered the burger with blue cheese and onions and it was done perfectly!  The bun was very fresh and the meat was very juicy 

I would recommend this place to anyone who puts pride in to what they eat and where it comes from 

Next time I am going to try the bison burger"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was interesting, rather loud but that was expected. 
I was disappointed in the burger and the sides are expensive. Each addition to your burger is 1.50 regardless of what it is onions cheese or bacon . 
The Oscar burger looked great on the menu but was disappointing; the hollandaise sauce was runny and very poor. The lobster was chewy and wet as if it had been frozen. The burger came with pickles that were not on the menu. 
We sat at the prep bar and watched as the meals were prepared. It was crowded and the organization was poor. The prepared ingredients were often mixed as the narrow counter was cleared. 
The staff were the best part of the experience as they were attentive and appeared to care about the overall experience of the quests. 
Over all, the high  price and the ingredients will have an effect on the rating. 
We will try it again but I am not running to get back here."}
{"text":"We have been to this Burger Bar twice. Tonight was excellent as it was last visit. We were seated close to the open kitchen but this did not detract from our experience. 
My two sons and husband ordered the traditional burger. One had side salad, one the regular fries and one the Poutine. 
I ordered the Field of Dreams \"Burger\" on lettuce leaves. It us made of chic peas and barley topped with Ratatouille and a red pepper aioli. It was delicious. 
We started with the sweet potato fries with garlic mayo which was also excellent. 
The service by all of the staff was prompt and they helped each other out. Orders are taken on an I-pad for accuracy. The food is delicious. You can't go wrong. It is fast becoming a favourite of ours."}
{"text":"The place was well organized with plenty of open tables.  The patio looked very nice, but had a 20 minute wait.

We were sat inside and were immediately greeted by the server.  The drinks were ordered, along with the ground chips appetizer.

The ground chips were neat looking but very small for the cost.   I would not recommend this to anyone.

The server took the order directly onto an iPad, so it is safe to assume the order was sent into the kitchen, but the main course too a very long time.

The restaurant continued to fill up, and the server was overloaded.  She needed to be flagged down to get drunk refills.  My daughter promptly knocked over he drink, so the server walked by and dropped off a stack of napkins for us to clean up.

Presbussing was not a priority, as the dishes and wet napkins remained on the table to the conclusion of the meal.

We asked for a take out container and was dropped off at the table for us to package.  Still leaving the dishes.  We had to track down the server for the bill.

The food was very good, but rather on the greasy side.  This is the once on a while type place.  Not for regular dining.  Service was a definite weakness."}
{"text":"Tonight I went to Ground Burger and it was fantastic. My mom had recommended it and then I suggested a family outing. Make reservations and make them early if you want to go on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, as weekends are packed. On weeknights a there was 5 of us so still a bit of a wait (10-15 minutes longer) with our weeknight reservation because people lingered, but we got a great spot & great service so it was worth it.

 I got the signature medium well burger with added house smoked cheddar and added bacon, with a house salad. The burger was absolutely fantastic, cooked perfectly not bloody at all but yet still juicy and flavourful. The house smoked bacon was crunchy yet chewy and gave the perfect level of smokiness.

The atmosphere was relaxed but very well put together and I enjoyed the industrial theme within and found it very appealing. But make note, the tables to your left as you walk in the door aren't very well lit everywhere else is. We didn't get a chance to try the balcony due to the fact that it's January, but it looks like there's a great view of the river & riverwalk commons aka the splash pad and skating rink and I'll definitely be coming back in the spring/summer to check it out. 

Our waitress was so sweet and attentive and very helpful & she didn't hover, so we still had space for us to enjoy our meal. 

Overall my experience was fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went to Ground for a birthday dinner. Exceedwd our expectations.  Juicy burger amazing taste. Recommend the truffle aioli as a topping cause that sh*t doesn't suck !"}
{"text":"Visited Ground Burger three times since it's opened and have been very satisfied each time! Don't be concerned with a smaller menu, means the food is fresh. I've had the burger twice- it's perfect, and I'm not a huge burger eater. Fresh toppings, tasty patty.. And the bun! Oh baby. Delish. First night I tried their poutine which I would highly recommend- with dark gravy, fresh fries, large cheese curds and yes- Rosemary! It was tasty and different. My only complaint seems to be the same as others I've read online - very noisy.. Very cool atmosphere but if you sit inside it's a little hard to hear what's being said at your table. Best bet is to take advantage of the patio!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Love the burgers. Had the Vladimir Poutine bison burger in a pretzel bun with onion rings.  Sooooo friggin good. 

Washed in down with some good Goose Island IPA. 

Died and gone to heaven."}
{"text":"Really really good burgers.  Only reason I'm giving a 4 star vs 5 stars is the tipping.  The preset options are 18% 20% and then of course self selected percentage.  Let's be real this is a burger place in Newmarket - 15% seems like it should be a preset not 18 and 20... Come on now.  Besides that food is legit, get the chicken burger you won't be disappointed!  Signature is great too."}
{"text":"Pretty good burgers, really good fries and sweet potato fries. The pulled pork sandwich is the best I've ever tasted anywhere..... True story! They grind their own beef so if you're like me and prefer your burger cooked only to medium then this is the place for you. The staff was attentive and friendly but for a Sunday evening I thought they were a little understaffed. I only saw one waitress and the manager stepped in to help handle the entire floor. That said they did a nice job holding it all together. I like the atmosphere and the selection and variety on the menu is good. Are they the best burger in the area? Nope.... HBH around the corner still retains that crown IMHO. All in all though it was a good experience and we'd probably come back to try some different choices. They are a gourmet burger place so be prepared to spend a little more then you would at McDonald's. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Continuing on my Burger quest from last week which led me to an unsavoury dry burger experience, I still was not satisfied and continued on my journey to Newmarket where I've long awaited to try Ground Burger Bar.

I had been here once before and sat at the bar enjoying their famous Black and Blue burger with a salad and a pint or two of well-curated craft beer. From memory, the burger was fantastic, perfectly cooked, even at a medium well temperature, seasoned and topped. the kitchen really understands how to put together complimentary and even contradictory flavours to create the best result.

This most recent visit was to try their most recent creation developed for the Order the Yelp promotion. They created one of the weirdest and yet most amazing burger creations I've ever had the pleasure of trying. Santa's Little Yelper! A signature beef patty dusted in a \"Simpson spice\", Duff beer hot fudge, potato chips, L.T.O.P., served on a rainbow sprinkle bun (and a maraschino cherry on top).

Yes, you read that correctly.. hot fudge and potato chips on a burger on a sprinkle bun! I never thought I would have chocolate fudge on a hamburger but now I have and I don't think I can ever go back - I've tasted things, man... like real things!

The last thing I will mention is there amazingly curated craft beer menu, each beer paired perfectly with a different burger on the menu - and the pairings are all excellent!

Great burger times at Ground, I cannot wait to go back to dine in and maybe even order the Yelp burger one more time before the end of the month!

{"text":"This is one of those places that has a great ambiance, a patio, great view of the river (that runs under the building), and also has great meal options. There are several vegetarian options, and even a decent vegan menu. For non-vegan fare, there are some unique options, like boar or elk. The menu is refreshed often, and there's obvious care that goes into food prep and presentation. There's a real casual atmosphere in this place, and I think it's impossible to feel underdressed. If I'm getting together with someone who hasn't been here before, I try to remedy this, as everyone should visit the Ground Burger Bar at least once."}
{"text":"After much research and reviewing many delicious looking photos, a group of 7 of us went to the ground burger bar. We were beyond excited to indulge in these exquisite burgers that had the most amazing reviews. Our expectations were not even close to being met. We ordered The Oscar, Thunder down Under, Mary Had a Little Lamb, Field Of Dreams and Signature burger with bacon. How is it possible that every single burger was awful you ask? Simple, they were all over cooked, charred in fact and the burgers themselves were completely tasteless.The Oscars which supposedly had lobster tasted as if it came directly out of a can and  the hollandaise sauce was non existent - I think there was asparagus-I saw a speckle of green. The sides were the only items that did not disappoint. Over all it was a terrible experience, aside from the food being terrible and completely over priced the service wasn't much better. I don't know where the \"good review\" are coming from but these people certainly didn't eat there last night. We waited close to 45 minutes to receive our food and it wasn't even a busy night.  Mc Donalds does a far better job for a fraction of the cost. Don't waste your time and money people!"}
{"text":"The burgers are quite good.  The patio is nice.  Would love more selection when it comes to the burger topping combinations.  We will go back."}
{"text":"Decent burger and decent onion rings. The atmosphere was really cool in the restaurant but the service was lacking a little. Hard to get refills."}
{"text":"I'm starting to discover some pretty decent eats around the Newmarket Main Street area and this was one of them. 

They have a decent drink menu with of course mainly burgers on the food menu. There are a few items that caught my eye on the menu but I'm not sure in an appealing way. I noted that you can order alligator quesadilla and kangaroo meat patties for burgers. 

I opted for the signature burger with smoked cheddar cheese and wild mushroom salad as toppings. As my side, I had the house salad. I quite enjoyed the salad as the dressing was very light and there was chick peas in it. Overall the burger was quite well executed as well and very juicy with every bite. 

My party enjoyed the experience and we will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here. I go there during the day to do work. The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing. Try the sliders and poutine. Delish."}
{"text":"Guys this is a tasty burger. Me and brother came here about a week ago after searching for the best burger joints in Ontario and we found ground burger bar. 

When we walked inside we were greeted by a really cool waiter he served our food on time checked on us if we needed anything and made us feel welcomed 10/10 for service.

The burger I got was pretty simple with aged cheddar cheese and I have to say that it is the best burger that I've eaten in Canada. The meat was cooked medium rare and was so juicy. I also got truffle sauce which was delicious. 10/10 for dinner 

The best of all though was there fried Oreo. Guys this dessert gave me life it was so good I gave one to the couple sitting right next to me because I had to share all the love I was getting from that Oreo. Their dessert gets a 20/10

In conclusion ground burger bar is worth every penny and i highly recommend to anyone. I'm telling you guys this burger would convert vegans to meat eaters in a matter of seconds. You have to check this place out."}
{"text":"Hotstuff and I  visited based on Yelp reviews and it was just alright. I had a beef burger w/ house cured bacon and smoked cheddar and Hotstuff had the Vladimir Poutine which is a bison patty...both were very dry; our server informed us that the meat would be cooked to medium/well and I  wish I  had of requested med/rare
Buttermilk onion rings were pretty tasty and our server was friendly and just attentive enough"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews unless the restaurant has either exceeded my expectations or left me feeling with extreme dissatisfaction.  

Here is my story...

Service -- 1 STAR
- 1 out of 6 staff looked unfriendly and unhappy working there
- extremely slow and poor service
- food took too long... a simple poutine took almost half an hour to make it to our table

Food & Drinks -- Would give ZERO stars if I could!
- 2 burgers... very dry and bland patties, sauce was gross on Super Mario
- soup of the day... new england chowder was watery
- poutine... their spin on this was horrible - flavours did not work together
- milkshake -- very ordinary but I guess it was the best thing out of everything we had at Ground Burger
- frappucino -- too icey and bland.  $7 for watered down icey frapp

Ambience - 4 STARs
-- interior and patio is nice

Other than that... Ground Burger definitely left me with a huge disappointment.  Normally I am not wasteful (I would finish not-so-tasty food), but I really could not stuff a burger down my throat when it was so dry to the point I thought McDs would have been a better choice than paying $17 for the burger we had here!

Worst burger dining experience.  Ever.  Sorry to say.  I hope the owners of this restaurant realize they have to step up to the game with their staff, service, and of course food!"}
{"text":"This was now the second time I visited the burger bar. First experience was takeout.  Picked up order that was wrong, also left with order paying the additional cost of a order placed incorrectly by restaurant. After leaving, discovered takeout order included no napkins, utensils, or ketchup  (as requested). Called in to ask if condiments could be left at front for when I went back. Came back, waited over 10 minues for requested condiments. Asked for manager who finally gave me condiments. I explained how long I waited for my order (which was incorrect) and had no condiments. Told manager that food was now cold as it was ready over 20 minutes ago and I havent been able to go so I could eat it. Manager offered to only microwave my food. Food which was a burger, poutine and mac and cheese. Ya thanks, but no thanks. Manager did not seem to care whatsoever about inconvenience either.

Went again today thinking eating in may be different, and was still interested in other options on the menu. Service was incredibly sloooow. Server did not have a pleasant attitude either. Paid about $20 per entree for OK burgers and fries (down under burger, prime rib burger, and kung fu hustle etc). Bill was about $100 and felt I would have been better off at somewhere like hero's burgers or south street. Will not return mainly because of service as well as value."}
{"text":"Went here for a Friday lunch around 12:30 with a coworker. For some reason one of the lots nearby was closed but normally parking is pretty spacious. Got seats right away, and service was attentive, checking on us multiple times throughout the meal. 

Was thinking about ordering the Yelp promotion burger (with the fudge, chips and sprinkles), but figured I would try one of the more \"signature\" items for a first visit. Ended up getting the Black and Blue on the brioche bun (+ fries). Was done medium well as ordered and the flavor of the chipotle stood out to me. Fries was good and not too salty.  

Wish I could pair the burger with a beer, so maybe I will visit another time when I'm not the driver. Definitely a unique menu with all the different options and combinations!"}
{"text":"Ground Burger is decent, but not my favourite burger joint by far.  We ordered the poutine with andouille sausages for appetizers, and two Ground Signatures (one with smoked cheddar, bacon, and fried egg, and another with smoked cheddar and grilled onions).  The poutine was good, but for $12, definitely not worth it.  Even for $8, the portion was tiny.  The one thing going for the burgers is their size; I was definitely full after my meal.  Other than that, I was disappointed.  I ordered mine on a pretzel bun, but it was so dry I had to wash each bite down with water.  Not sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic burger. I got the Black and Blue burger (I substituted blue cheese for Swiss cheese, however) on a brioche bun. The burger was perfectly cooked, with a great balance between juicy centre and crisp edges. It was absolutely delicious. The burger isn't cheap, though. It cost $16.00 with a side of fries. Definitely worth it once in a blue moon. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the eclectic atmosphere, as well."}
{"text":"Focusing on mastering a great burger just the way you like it. I would highly recommend for anyone who has a burger craving. Lots of beers on tap and yummy milkshakes for the kids."}
{"text":"Very good burger. Great atmosphere. I'll be back for sure. We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon and was met with a cheery wait staff who explained everything well. The burgers were a tad messy but so delicious. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome organic beef burgers! I hit this place up about once a month and I'm never disappointed. If you're looking for a great homemade burger I recommend this place."}
{"text":"GBB is definitely one of my favourite restaurants in Newmarket! Great drinks, great food and the staff is always so friendly."}
{"text":"Best burgers in town period.
Friendly service and a manager that's on it.
My family and i thought there were a good number of items on the menu and the atmosphere is very nice."}
{"text":"Friends and I come here almost on a weekly basis and have NEVER been disappointed! Burgers are unreal, always perfectly cooked, great tasting sides, and a variety of awesome beer! Sweet potato fries are a must. I've tried their signature burger, elk, lamb, and all are delicious.. Bread pudding was so yummy too!"}
{"text":"I have been to Ground Burger Bar a few times since they've opened. Last summer, I enjoyed a great burger and a cider on their patio during the Newmarket Jazz Festival. Their fries are seasoned and taste so good! Their burgers are really good. I tend not to go too exotic with my toppings so I can't say too much about their gourmet selections. One night, we did try the deep-fried Oreos which were amazing but I think the deep-frying makes the middle icing a bit too sweet for my liking. Their drinks are ice-cold. I do especially like that they feature Brickworks Stadium Island peach cider, a new product for Brickworks. It is not too sweet and will be a perfect drink for the summer. I will definitely be back there soon!

I would like to add that the Ace of Clubs is the best club sandwich I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now, the burgers i've had have all been tasty and i would eat every one of them again! First time i went with the Lamb burger and a beef burger with cheese and bacon, with 2 salads instead of fries... I consider myself a burger aficionado, so i know a good burger when i eat one. 

2 words - mind blown

I couldn't wait to go back for a second visit, i think it was about 2 weeks later. And i doubled down again, but this time 2 beef burgers with cheddar, no bacon. Sooo goood!! 

Can't wait to go back again! 

Also, they have a great selection of beers, there is a beer type for every beer drinker. 

One thing tho, i would stay away from the pretzel bun, its soooo heavy, and chewy... Makes all the toppings squeeze out the back since its tough to bite thru."}
{"text":"I think if a man took me here, I would immediately husband him. This place is cute, romantic and food-coma-ish at the same time. The wood fixtures and beautiful Hollywood-esque lights with the beautiful insta-worthy sign on the patio wall makes this place the perfect date night that will still make you the fullest person ever. 

Lots of burgers and vegetarian choices here. There are many different burgers with chicken, veal (fancy), beef and veggie (chick pea or mushrooms etc). Let's just say I've never been so damn full from a fucking veggie burger. The sweet potato fries that it came with were also massive - they were the best I've ever had! Also each burger is recommended with a cider or beer, and the apple somersby I paired mine with gave it the perfect aftertaste. Ugh, too good. I got my burger on a pretzel bun and when I had it, it was heaven on earth. Only one piece of advice - don't get any other bun. 

I'm not usually a fan of burgers at all but this place really stole my heart."}
{"text":"This place has my pick for not only best burgers in Newmarket, but best poutine as well. Add some bacon lardons to your poutine and you will be very happy you did. There's alot of choice here, the warm potato salad is sooo good.... there's lots of beer on tap. Great place to come on the weekend and watch some English Premiere League football (i can't call it soccer, sorry). So come here, have a burger, poutine, pint (or 2) and enjoy yourself. I have every time!"}
{"text":"Love the interior design and small details in the restaurant. Interesting menu choices, on the higher end of $$. Tasty cocktails, don't remember the name of what we got and a Caesar. The menu is not  large but well crafted. Very tasty  
Very very noisy though"}
{"text":"If you're going to try punch into the crowded burger segment, you might as well go for the brass ring.  Ground Burger Bar has set up a pretty impressive operation, starting with eclectic decor that keeps your interest while you wait for your meal.  The open kitchen at the back of the house looks clean and orderly.

But what about the food?  The menu is interesting as well, with a number of unusual offerings, starting with appetizers like Octopus Tacos, and Poke.  The strange thing is that they only have 3 burgers on the menu: Signature, Black & Blue, and Oscar.  The others are not traditional beef burgers, including a veggie, chicken and pork option.

None of the beef burgers got me, so I decided to try the Crazy Korean, which is a pork patty covered in kimchee, daikon, apple slaw, lettuce and a honey hoisin sauce. I chose the pretzel bun to wrap around the already interesting combination.

The burger arrived on a small plank with a side of dirty fries, hiding the fact that the juices were about to come spilling out just like any other spectacular burger.  The kimchee had a nice bite, and the pork patty was flavourful.  

So in the world of burger joints, how does the Ground Burger Bar stack up on  $20 for a burger and an iced tea?  For Newmarket, I would rate GBB at the top, barely a notch higher than the Works, but the Works has a much larger variety of actual burgers.  Then comes South Street, then 5 Guys, etc. GBB is off to a good start!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I've been a couple times, both times the place was slammed. So if you don't have a reservation around dinner you could be waiting a bit. 
Service can be a bit slow at times, but understandable with how busy they get.
I love a good burger, and you can tell the burgers are fresh and not frozen with good ingredients. 
Their Lobster Mac and Cheese was great, but I will say it was a bit dry and not gooey enough? (If you know what I mean haha) But I finished it regardless.

The apps are on the bigger side, so I sometimes have an app as my entree. 

Overall great place, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"It's my first time at Ground Burger Bar. I love the decorum. The atmosphere is friendly. My beer is cold and delicious and served in a timely manner. Unfortunately, \"The Ground Poke\" is terrible. The tuna and octopus is too small and takes on an overpowering taste of onion. It's served with greasy deep fried corn chips and the dish itself is sloppy and soaked. The patio, although peaceful and quaint, is overrun with wasps. This is more of a \"mother nature\" issue but still makes for an uncomfortable stay."}
{"text":"I popped by Ground Burger Bar to grab a quick burger since it is a stones throw from our office. I had a very different idea of what this place was. I was pleasantly surprised to learn it was more than just a take out joint. The server was friendly and assisted me in placing my order. I didn't pay attention to the prices on my menu (my bad) so was a little shocked to see a burger and fries were $19. They were very quick, 10 min which was exactly what they had quoted me, which is always aces in my book!

The fries were wonderfully seasoned and were a generous helping. I am the type to eat all of one thing before another item so I was too full to eat my burger right away. I reheated it for supper and oh. my. god. It was hands down the absolute best burger I've ever eaten! I can only imagine how epic it would have been fresh! 

My only reason for giving 4 stars is that they put the wrong cheese on it but it was so delicious it didn't diminish the experience one bit; can't wait to try it with the cheese I wanted. 

All in all I highly recommend Ground Burger Bar but for someone like me, who can't afford a $19 burger on the regular, it will be my new \"treat myself\" spot! 

On a side note... while I was waiting a customer called with an unusual request. I was really pleased that after the call they didn't bad mouth her as so many would have done when they knew the person wouldn't know. That's really surprising in this day and age!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a number of times over the past two years when  I come to Newmarket. A lot of options to choose between I like the build your own burger and you can even add mac and cheese to it. Burgers are so filling and the choice of beers are amazing. Staff is always making the experience fun and even sitting up at the bar I felt welcome. Order the onion rings they are amazing."}
{"text":"That was the tastiest and the juiciest burger I ever tried! I was there with a couple of friends, and we all ordered different burgers. The best one in my opinion was the bison burger and the Oscar! Both were absolutely delicious! Even though it was more than a month ago even thinking about it makes me drool :)
The lime chicken tacos were good as well.
I normally don't pay too much attention to it, but I really liked the design and especially the shoe hanging from the lamp;) I think it's very clever. 
The service was very fast and friendly, and  prices are very reasonable imho, considering that the portions are pretty big."}
{"text":"Great burger place right off Main Street. Some good selections of meats (even a vegetarian option) - all with some unique toppings on top of it. I had the Mary Had a Little Lamb burger, which is a lamb burger with red pepper jelly (so good!) and goat cheese. The side of poutine was great too - good mix of gravy and cheese curds. Service was great too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This was a great find for me.  I was visiting the area for business and really wanted a good burger.  The atmosphere is very relaxed, and the staff are very friendly.  I sat at the bar and there was a one page menu.  I had the classic burger with bacon and cheese and upgraded my side to poutine. The burger was wonderfully juicy and the bun was perfect.  The poutine was equally as delicious.  I will definitely stop back to visit if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"Nope! Won't be going back. They were open but refused to seat us at 9pm on a Tuesday  despite being open till 10:30. Not at all apologetic. Total BS. Me and my brother were in Newmarket on business trip and were starving. Apparently customer service is not a priority. The kitchen staff want to clean up early and get paid for the last hour despite not working. Ate here once and the burgers were so-so; after my second disappointment I certainly  won't be back. Never again!"}
{"text":"Pretty good bar food and not too expensive. This is a very casual dining experience. I'm not a huge burger fan but the others in our party really enjoyed their choices. To me, they had way too much stuffed into that big ol bun. But hey, that's what makes it good to the burger lovers, right? 

I had a wasabi steak sandwich called the Hattori Hanzo. Good name. I could have used a samurai sword to cut through the steak. Ba-dum-Ching! Yes, the steak was a little tough but what do you want for 18 bucks? And let's face it. It's called Ground Burger Bar for a reason. Stick with the burgers. 

My main problem with this place was the noise. It was hard to hear what the person across the table was saying. Everyone seemed to be shouting over everyone else's shouting. It was kind of funny. But not. 

On the plus side, the service was great. They were friendly and fast."}
{"text":"So we specifically came here because this place had 4 Stars. We came in and sat for almost 20 min before anyone came over. They finally came and gave us all water and then only asked 2 of our party of 8 what they wanted to drink. She brought their drinks and never asked anyone else if they wanted something. Then she came back to take our orders. We ordered 2 appetizers. She asked if we wanted them before the meal or with and we said before. 20 min later....nothing. A table that was sat next to us, that came in after us, had finished their appetizers before ours had even come out. The manager finally came to our table and said that our appetizers were lost in the shuffle and she would Comp them. They came out just before the food. For the most part the food was really good. The burgers were over cooked but still good. We were on a very tight schedule today so this was not what we needed. Wish I could give more stars. Seems like a cool place."}
{"text":"After months of waiting for it to open I finally had the chance to try Ground Burger bar. We had the Kim cheese which was served in a tiny deep fryer basket, a nice touch. I just wish you were given more than 3 pieces, however they were very good I would definitely order them again. I also had the signature burger with Swiss cheese, bacon and grilled onions on brioche. The burger was delicious but a bit messy, make sure to ask for extra napkins! The fries were crispy and dusted with herbs which was really nice and were also served in a small basket. The staff was friendly and seemed eager to please. The decor was really nice too, and really created a nice atmosphere. Overall I had a wonderful experience, it's a little pricey but I'm willing to spend a little extra for a good burger."}
{"text":"I visited Ground Burger Bar last week after perusing the Saturday farmer's market in Newmarket. We had already eaten in the market but stopped by to satisfy an insatiable craving for milkshakes (I'm lactose intolerant but hello, it's summer and I still gotta live my life.)

When you walk inside, it's a dark, industrial restaurant with hipster vibes - lots of exposed brick, wood, light up signs...very Instagram friendly. We ordered strawberry milkshakes on the patio (you can get them half-sized for $3 and they come in cute little milk bottles, topped with a dollop of whipped cream. (I'm told you can even order them spiked) It was delicious, but I'm glad I didn't order a full shake because I was stuffed by the end of it.

Left the restaurant feeling very Betty & Veronica. I plan on coming back to try a burger next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to visit Ground Burger Bar for quite some time now, especially when we make the trip up to Upper Canada Mall. They recently introduced a new menu and had a lobster Mac and cheese on the menu, we ordered that along with a clam chowder and of course their burger.

Clam chowder was really good and reminded us of a soup we used to get at the Cheesecake Factory. Also ample of delicious little neck clams. The lobster mac and cheese, even though it was on the appetizer menu, was a very filling portion in a small skillet, we had to take this to go. We loved how it had a lot of lobster and the taste was not masked by a large amount of cheese. The burger was cooked medium well and was very juicy, so another thumbs up. 

I'll be back to try their lamb burger soon !!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out and get take out. Got 3 burgers and a salad but they misheard us and got the salad wrong. Other than that the flavours were good, slightly overpowering as everything left an aftertaste. By the time I opened my food it was all soggy which was expected. They give huge portions which is great but not sure if i could justify the $90 bill. 

Definitely will try to give this place another chance though."}
{"text":"Frankly I have no idea what are the 1 stars are about.  I have eaten burgers and different cuisines around the world  including North America, Europe and Asia.  So I know what I like and what's good as a restaurant.  Not to mention that I love cooking all kinds of dishes at home too.  Anyway to keep it short, though I can't compare this place with some gastro pubs downtown, this place has a great selection of draft and crafted beer.  I ordered the black and blue with multigrain bun and sweet potatoes fries. The burger is fresh, very juicy and flavourful though the salsa is a bit salty to my liking, I still like it. The sweet potato fries were made perfectly as you have to know it is not easy to cook perfectly done sweet potatoes fries with soft in the Center while it's still crispy and golden brown outside.  And it's thick cut too, not greasy at all.

The atmosphere and decoration is great with some detail to its design. Service is friendly and prompt. If the wait time is long it might be just because they are too good with lots of customer.  Try some eateries in Cali and you know what I mean.  Waiting for 45mins for a crab meat sandwich is normal when they are that good.

I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. I'm just being conservative so I hope it has more space to improve.  Like the placement of the tables, not sure what it is but I think they can make it more cozy.  It's a bit like cafeteria in the area closer to kitchen.  They should close a bit later than 22:30.  I'd definitely picky this place over Hungry Brew Hops with the better food.  But they close much later with more choices of crafted beer on tap. 

I'd recommend it to my friends if you ask me.  I hope they can keep up with the standard and I'll definitely come back for other taps and burgers. :)"}
{"text":"Delicious! A great place to bring friends or family. Having a hot dog on the menu helps when one family member doesn't do burgers. The menu changes from time to time but it keeps things interesting. Love that this place is in the area."}
{"text":"I am in love with the Ground Burger burgers!!! I also love that they have low carb options such as a lettuce leaf wrap instead of a bun.  The energy is great and there's ample parking but I recommend making a reservation for big groups!"}
{"text":"So I just left ground burger after waiting 30 mins with my 2 kids, wife and mother-in law. They told us 25 mins to be seated. After 30 mins and multiple people with reservations were seated I asked how much longer. They told us another 25 mins. They saw how upset we were and we decided we would leave. She just said sorry and didn't do anything to make up for it. Maybe a discount next time or something. Either way, it ruined our evening and now it's super late so we need to get fast food. Thanks a lot ground burger."}
{"text":"I came here with 3 friends after snowboarding 8 minutes before the kitchen closed. Our waiter was amazing. So funny and made sure we got our orders in so we didn't starve. I got the Rosco burger which was basically chicken and waffles. Just typing this is making me crave it. I've never been a huge fan of chicken and waffles but this burger was incredible. The perfect blend of flavours and texture. Not too sweet which I really appreciated. The fries were excellent. 

My boyfriend got the black and blue burger which had this blue cheese spread...I was originally going to get this but I'm not a fan of blue cheese. The waiter got me a sample of the spread to try which I'm very thankful for or else I probably wouldn't have enjoyed my food very much. I still tried the burger and I have to say, in the burger, it didn't actually taste so bad!

It's on a cute little street right by the outdoor hockey rink. I would definitely consider coming back here!"}
{"text":"Update re: being kid friendly: dined in with my husband and baby today and was so pleased that they had high chairs available and a change table in the washroom. As for the food...AMAZING again! Does not disappoint and still gets 5 stars again from me. Burgers are nothing short of spectacular and the onion rings are still the best I've ever had anywhere. So good!"}
{"text":"Upon a friend's suggestion to try this place. I took my teenaged there for dinner. A bit out of our local area (30 mins by highway) bit willing to give it a try. Nice atmosphere, upon entry was promptly greeted and taken to our reserved table (it would have been a wait otherwise.) Serving staff was busy but did greet us after a brief 5 mins wait. Ordered the purple people burger (elk burger) and my son chose the old man and the sea burger (burger with tuna). Food took 50 mins to arrive and waitress didn't come by to check on my empty water glass until I asked. Quality of the food was good but was a bit slow coming out of the kitchen and a bit pricey ."}
{"text":"5 star food, resulting in a very busy restaurant and staff that can't keep track. It was a 45 minute wait until we could get a table, so they told us to go to the bar and we asked if they could tell us when a table is ready, but they gave the table to a person who just walked in. We had to eat at the second bar, which was really inconvenient. The place looks really big from the outside but they need a bigger restaurant or not giant round tables in the back. Don't go here on weekend nights, it's horribly busy. 

On a positive note, the food was amazing and I would definitely come here on a week night or lunch when there's less people."}
{"text":"I love this place! Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had. The portions are filling, the fries are toppings are fresh and the meat is just juicy and tender! I can't wait to go back! Only minor negative is that fact that it's in a basement setting so no windows. Although, I did see a patio which may be open in the summer? I'm not sure. Overall it was a great little restaurant with great food and great service."}
{"text":"An excellent selection of drafts - this will keep me coming back. Great location and interior.
Veggie burger is OK, but would love another veggie option (other than a salad). Much better experience second time there."}
{"text":"They have some very interesting burger combinations that actually work, I'm just not convinced they are worth the price $$$. Upgrade to something other than fries costs $4, the poutine was worth it and tasty, but the onion rings were nothing special."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out Ground Burger Bar after a couple of friends mentioned about this gourmet burger joint in Main Street Newmarket :) 

We shared the following items on the menu:

The Black & Blue burger on a pretzel bun with fries was very delicious! The house signature Cajun-crusted patty was so tender and juicy and great house made sauces. This seemed like a popular choice since my friends recommended it and the table next to us also ordered it lol.

The Charred Red Pepper & Tomato Soup paired perfectly with a side order of classic grilled cheese. The goat cheese was a nice touch in the soup. I enjoy dipping the sandwich into the hearty soup for that perfect bite!

We ended the meal with some Deep Fried Oreos. You need to save room for this! This dessert was so delicious and addictive with the light and crispy batter, dolce de leche drizzles and that mint leaf though... that was the cherry on top for me. The mint leaf tied so well with the flavours... you just need a little nibble of it for every big bite of Oreo ^_^ #lifechanging

Nice beer selection. Vegetarian and gluten-free options available. Great place for family and friends... absolutely love the causal atmosphere! Great food and very friendly service. Highly recommend this gourmet burger bar if you're coming up to the North.

P.S. Don't forget to take a picture with their Instagram frame hung by the entrance before you leave!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. My first I was not that impressed but perhaps it was just what I ordered. I felt like even though the poutine has gotten a award, it was too \"herby\" the day I went.

Second time and third time was better. The sweet potato fries are AMAZING. The service is good. 

The third time I went, my friend's appetizer was VERY COLD. Maybe that it was frozen? However when they brought a new one (cheeseburger egg rolls) it was delicious like I had the very first time. 

Overall I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I love their burgers!  But the reason they lose 1* is because their burgers always fall apart and I have to use a knife and fork :( 

the best burger IMO is the Jamaican one?  Not sure what it's called but the heat from the peppers with the cool of the sauce amazing! 

Also get the ground Cesar ahhh so amazing, and it's like an appetizer that'll get you drunk!  If you had enough it could be a enter and drink :p"}
{"text":"We tried their deep fried pickles which were great. They weren't like any of the other pickles we've had elsewhere. The burgers are really delicious."}
{"text":"So jus wanted to mention we did skip the dishes for this order which may or may not be a factor in my rating.
There was 3 of us.
I ordered the grilled cheese w a poutine and the  \"ball park served on a fresh baked bun\" w onion rings. I hve very specific cravings right now lol so dont judge blame the growing baby.
The onion rings were great crispy on the outside w just the right thickness of onion on the inside. Grilled cheese was great as well smoked chedder cheese, it was through skip the dishes so it might have been cheesier who know but I still enjoyed it. The so called ball park dog was garbagr and a disappointment even for a child(kids menu). It was a dry shriveled chicken hotdog u get in the 12 pk at the grocery store for 2$. Poutine was also good but not great ,lacked cheese for sure.

Second order was a build your own burger on a  Brioche Bun.Beef Patty - Well Done w Smoked Cheddar Cheese,Jalapenos and house cured bacon. Mac and cheese as well which she thought would be on the burger but came on the side. Also got a side of truffle garlic and chipolte aioli. I used the chipolte for my onion rings, the dips were all good but again nothing special. 
I did really enjoy the mac and cheese it was nice and thick w adequate amount of cheese. My sister said her burger was great but over cooked. She likes it well done but it was kind of charcoled. The burgers also arent that thick and very dry. 

Last order was the Vladimir Poutine w sweet potatoe fries. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her meal but same she said the burger isnt as thick as she expected given the price. She also expected a bit more sweet potato fries.

For dessert we ordered fruit strudle which was so yummmy. Best thing out of all the things we ordered. Jus enough fruit inside and its not overly sweet given that its cheesecake strudle. 

I might be back but in person to see if maybe things are different but i think that this place is a bit over priced.

1 adult meal(burger and fries), 2 kids meals(grilled cheese, hot dog, side poutine and onion rings and 1 make your own burger was 97$"}
{"text":"I've eaten at many many many burger places. I like to consider myself a burger (and sushi) afficienado of sorts. 

When I see the potential for this place....I shake my head. 
We got there and found a place that was full of people but really lacked seating. My friend commented that they could easily seat more  people with better allocation. So we were told immedatley it would be a 30 minute wait.  Wow...For a burger??? In newmarket??
Not even the busiest chains in Toronto take that long...

So we get there... We have drinks as we wait at the bar (maybe a tactic)...then 10 minutes later we're asked to pay for our drinks and then we'll be seated.... Umm why not just transfer the bill to our table? Awkward... Also...take the extra step and have the hostess bring our drinks over, dont make us shlep 20 bucks of drinks over to our table ourselves...Its a really basic service that could go a long way or courtesy. 

So we sit down and order. I get my burger... I got some sort of burger with lobster on it. It was probably the flattest burger i've tasted. No taste whatsoever. It came with a hollandaise sauce and  I went out of of my way to taste the burger portion with no sauce....It was not good. 

The best part of this place may have just been the fries which have a delightful taste of \"sour cream and onion\" chips. Brought me back to my child hood. In reality, the fries have green onion or chives or something on them. They were nice. 

I asked my burger to be medium rare, it was fairly raw. The place is just pretentious and doesnt seem to know what theyre doing. From top to bottom. Theyre trying really hard to do something very basic and failing at every aspect. 

They get two out of 5 for the fries, the pretzel bun option and that its not a frozen patty. 
Other then that, I can cook a better burger at home. 


I'm willing to bet that this place gets the good reviews it does simply because its Newmarket. If this place were in Toronto with heavier competition....It wouldnt stand a chance."}
{"text":"Have been to Ground Burger bar a few times and the food is always great. The lamb burger and the black and blue are my go-tos. I like how they have a few options for buns or just lettuce if you're watching the carbs. For an app try the deep fried pickles. They are coated in crushed potato chips which makes the outside very crispy. 

Usually sit at the bar so service is normally attentive. However this past Saturday I went in for lunch and sat at a table. Service was horrible! Our waitress seemed so disinterested in her job, except when she brought the credit card machine and it was tip time. 

I would return but will stick with sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere 
Friendly service
Great fancy selections 
Pricey but food quality is top notched"}
{"text":"In the Newmarket area and decided to try out this burger joint Ground Burger on Main Street! Dope place, loved the vibe, and the whole environment. Amazing staff very welcoming. 

Simple menu everything on one page (excluding drinks) no pictures, and I'm a picture menu type of guy which is okay I felt daring tonight. I decided on the Deep Fried Pickles for my app, and got the Dances with Wolves burger which is a Bison patty with all that jazz with pretzel bun w/ sweet potato fries. 

Burgers aren't difficult too judge because it's all about the patty, either it's dry or juicy? Tonight's burger was dry, my girlfriends was dry too. Not sure if that's for every burger but all the condiments on the burger were legit, and the sweet potato fries with the sauce tho!!! amazing!! Would come back for the fries most definitely!!

Had 3 cups of coke now I'm done!"}
{"text":"This place is frigin awesome!  I mean - probably the best bar I've been to in Ontario (including all the downtown hipster ones).  They have such an awesome beer selection for a bar in NEWMARKET!  They also carry ciders like Brickworks, which is rare to find outside of Toronto.  Great atmosphere and the food quality is top notch!  They source a lot of their ingredients locally and you can taste it.  I'm vegetarian so I usually get their salads and veggie burgers...all of which are amazing.  I do wish they had more vegetarian options as I love coming here, but end up eating the same 3 meals over and over.  But oh well...the Beer selection keeps me busy.

Note to owners:  you guys gotta expand or buy out the space above you.  Your restaurant is so good and people love coming here, but lately it's really tough to get a seat."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here. The first was 3 days after they opened and it was horrible. I decided to give it another try hoping they worked out the kinks. Unfortunately they fell short. The service was friendly but extremely slow. The restaurant wasn't even busy. I ordered the Signature burger on a pretzel bun with fries. The burger was over cooked and dry. The patty lacked flavour and was too small for the bun. The fries were ok. I won't be giving this place a third try."}
{"text":"How lucky is Newmarket to have this great burger place. Came here randomly because we were in the area from Markham and checked Yelp for burgers.  What a great menu with choices of beef, turkey, lamb and other burgers with lots of bun and add on options.  Burgers come medium well but the grilling was great and not dry.  Only comment is that the brioche bun seemed a bit greasy probably from the burger, making it a bit messy.  Fries were great except some were runts (tiny pieces). Other menu items looked so interesting besides just burgers.  May need to make the drive again just to try some other yummy things.  They take reservations but we enjoyed sitting at the bar since the place was packed."}
{"text":"I am not the biggest burger fan, but dang that was amazing. Blew me out of the water. Kapow. 

Came as a group and I ordered the mama Mia burger. Jeeeeeez. You can choose your bun, and obviously your girl chose a brioche as it is the most fanciest sounding, and it came with a veal patty with lots of cheese, some meats like pepperoni I believe, a BIG portabella mushroom and it was so good. I couldn't even finish cause it was too massive. You can also order a side, to which I ordered the onion rings. Fantastic. You can really tell everything was made to order and made in house by how unique and delicious everything was. Everyone at our table ordered a different side and main and everything looked equally appetizing and HUGE. 

I usually dislike paying like $16 for a burger, but I can definitely vouch for them as this is prob. One of the best I've ever tasted. +1000 bonus points for being an aesthetically pleasing restaurant as well. 

Love it. 5/5."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and drink menu and service. Burgers are fresh and interesting.  This time I customized my own burger which was good however I should have gone with one from the menu that they dress up.  I've been here several times and this time the fries and onion rings were a little salty but could have been that day only.  Great selection of Brews on menu and staff are friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"The ground burger bar doesn't fail to satisfy!  
Talk about hidden gem. 

Location: 
Its in downtown Newmarket off of main Street, actually behind it, next to the splash pad. Hard to find unless you know it's there

Parking:
There's a small lot at the door but it's next to more than enough parking. No worries. Worse case you walk for 3 minutes

Decor:
Yeah this place is pretty cool. Fancy industrial/ hipster/ dive bar / coyote ugly bar. Looks like what some of the places in Toronto are going for but fail at. Seating is awesome. A real welcome relief, they don't have a hundred seats squashed in next to each other so you don't  end up practically sharing a meal with the strangers sitting on either side of you. They have bench seats, tables, booths and a pretty sweet patio. 

Food:
Fantastic.
The menu changes often but the faves stay or get tweeted slightly. I like that, it keeps it exciting. 
The burgers are great. Juicy, well cooked. Fresh buns and toppings. 

Glad it's in Newmarket and not Toronto, you can still walk in and get a seat most times with little or no wait. If this place was in Toronto or Markham, you'd need a reservation or have the 1 hour + waits!

They have this garlic bread appetiser that's making me salivate just thinking about it. Warm and buttery. I always wonder how weird i would look of I go in and just order it. Until I build up the courage I'll order it to share on the table.

Ok. Another app to die for, the sweet potatoes fries. They cook them perfectly. There's nothing worse than a burnt sweet potato fry. Never had one! 

My new fave? \"That'll do pig\". Pulled pork belly on a soft bin with coleslaw ( super dressing) , looks like almonds, and a spicy shmeared sauce. Yummo! Big recommendations for this one!!!

Staff
Everyone who works here is so cool. Like I want to be them when I grow up!  And really nice.


Conclusion
Come!!!"}
{"text":"I have a prediction....  A new long lasting hot spot in the heart of Newmarket, and it goes by the name Ground Burger Bar.  Like numerous others, I have waited in anticipation for this place to open, myself being somewhat of a massive burger fan.  
First of all... amazing location, right next to Main Street in Newmarket, by the park, right next to where they have the Farmers Market.  You cannot pick a better spot.  
I have been to this place twice now... and I will admit that the first visit was a little rocky, but that was based on inexperienced wait staff (which I will assure you has been corrected).  
These burgers are great... good selection of different types, they are put together well, presented well.  They have some other sandwich offers (veggie, blt, etc).  The deep fried pickle appetizer is awesome, great fries, very good onion rings.  I will advise that I find the appetizers a little on the pricy side, but again, I think the price matches the location of this restaurant. 
There is an absolutely great patio on the side of this restaurant, and the place even offers blankets to those a little chilly eating or drink outside.  
During my last visit, there was some live music, and this place got a little loud, and a little rockin... as it should for a Sunday night during a long weekend.  
Now for the kicker... the owner/manager Grant... walks around introducing himself, asking if everything is okay, listens to his customers and takes their ideas, suggestions, complaints, seriously.  This is really at the heart of what makes a great restaurant for me... and that is the attitude that the owner and the employees want to provide a good experience for their customers, and I can say, that that is what this restaurant is after.  They aim to please.  I'm sure there will be more changes as these Newmarket burger champs further discover to absolute best way to deliver a great customer service... but for the time being, good food, good customer service, good location, and good restaurant.  Suggested.... ask for Grant and introduce yourself, and try some of this awesome food.  
Cheers... and I will be back!"}
