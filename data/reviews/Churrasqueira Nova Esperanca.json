{"text":"This is what a great mom and pop take out restaurant is suppose to be.   Great fresh food, excellent service, real culture.   Whole  chicken and tray of potatoes about $16.00.    I would give them 5 stars if they did not charge for interact.   What is this 1985."}
{"text":"THE BEST PORTUGUESE FOOD AROUND!!!! I always get the chicken on the grill NOT ROTISSERIE if you want rotisserie go to swiss chalet real Portuguese chicken is made on the grill over charcol & this place makes it right!!! If you like spicy there hot sauce is really good you can get it on the side or smothered over the chicken. There fried fish filets are actually crispy & golden unlike most places around that use old oil and there fish comes out dirty brown and saturated. Another must try here is there shrimp patties you can tell there home made SO GOOD!!!! They make them fresh when you order I always get atleast 6 and I end up eating half if not all on the drive home."}

{"text":"Best portuguese chicken in brampton! Get there early, almost always a line up. Hot sauce for the chicken is so good!!"}
{"text":"Our favourite Portuguese take away!! Food is always 100% delicious and fresh. Excellent customer service and great prices! We first ordered here for my engagement party a couple years ago when our other restaurant messed up and we needed food urgently. They had no issue providing food for 70 people very quickly and affordably. People were asking where we got the food from. The line is sometimes long but that's because they are popular and busy. You can always phone ahead too.  I highly recommend anyone to go here!"}
{"text":"I ordered takeout and got the rotisserie chicken with potatoes and rice and a custard pie based on the reviews on this place. I was craving Portuguese chicken since I used to eat it regularly when I was in misssissauga at Mario's BBQ or Barraida. I was so disappointed in the quality of food, the chicken was slimey on the inside and gamey and sticky on the outside, the meat fibres were prominent which lead me to believe I received a heavily frozen chicken that was likely express-thawed since the chicken smelled so bad I couldn't bear eating it. The smell from the chicken seeped into the potatoes ruining everything. The custard pie was soggy. Not ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant for take out Portuguese style rotisserie chicken. Prices are very reasonable and portion sizes are bountiful. They also have a number of items that don't show on their wall menu but have up front.  I had a half rotisserie chicken with Potatoes and veggies. Saw the grilled Charros at the last minute when ordering and couldn't resist. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very busy, no frills, reliable and affordable Portuguese takeout chicken. You're not getting a meal that's going to knock you out or anything, but the chicken is still pretty inexpensive and much better than ones you'd get at any grocery store. Stop by at dinner time and there's consistently several people in line - but they keep it moving. Also means the chicken will be fresh. You have a choice of rotisserie or grilled too.

Chicken: 4
Sides: 3
Value: 4.5"}
{"text":"Best Portuguese chicken in the city! The greatest thing about this restaurant is that no matter how large the line, you usually get your food within a reasonable time frame. Their systems are just that good for cooking. 

Be warned: Their medium sauce has a wicked kick to it! If you are weary of any heat in your food, stick to mild!"}
{"text":"I actually find the Rotisserie Mechanism quite interesting itself.  It looked like a Metallic Medieval Torture Chamber with Gears and all.  At least it beats out all those plain old boring Swiss Chalet style Rotisseries.  I walk in to see the mid-age Man greet me and as a standard I requested for the usual Meal.  While he did so I browse the Drink Fridge and notice exactly what I needed for a quick  pick-me-up, Guaran√° Antarctica !

When I turned around to face him, he got the Chicken from a Tray while scooping out some Tomatoed Rice and Parisian Potatoes.  Nice Gentleman because he offered slightly more to me as it was within half an hour prior to closing the doors.  While I was there I even noticed that he brought the food out to the door where a Peel Police Officer was waiting in the Cruiser.  Yes, between himself and the women inside they did bicker a bit but I guess that's what they mean by Tough-Love.

1/4 Chicken, Dark Meat Dinner.  He added 0.5 of 1/4 Chicken as Bonus.

1/4 + (1/4 x 1/2)   =   1/4 + 1/8   =   3/8 Chicken Dinner!

The Rotisserie does give the Chicken a good browning on the skin while the Meat is A-Okay.  The Peri-Peri Sauce has a good Spicy TANGY flavour on it as much as a few others(Non-Brampton) I've been to.  The Parisian Potatoes are standard while the Al-dente Tomatoed Rice give some resistance that I didn't even mind it wasn't the Saffron Rice I have a preference for.  Yeah, sad that I've some some soft mushy Tomatoed Rice."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places for rotisserie or grilled chicken in Brampton. The service can be hit or miss though and you might experience a bit of a language barrier when ordering depending on who's taking it. But the food is extremely good!"}
{"text":"We have been a customer for over 10 year s. Ribs and Chicken is excellent! Favourite restaurant in town!Can't go wrong getting food here."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, from the time they just opened up and the old cranky man was working by himself, to when his wife and daughter joined up with him.  Was just in last week and the daughter has taken it over and the old man has finally retired.  Frankly I won't miss him because he was a bitter grump, but the girl is very friendly and remembers her regulars.  I always get the same thing, the 2-chicken family pack and call in advance to request 1 grilled (needs 40min cooking time.) and 1 rotisserie style.  Grilled is 50 cents more, but I love having the two types for contrast.  Tried their ribs on a recent visit and they weren't bad either, dry rubbed with no sauce.  Potatoes and rice are nothing special but aren't really offensive either.  Throw a bit of the piri piri sauce on 'em and you're good to go.  Shrimp fritters looked interesting too, but I already had enough food to feed my house on the last visit, so I'll check those out next time.  I still say they've got the best Portuguese chicken in Brampton (Better than Martin's, better than Lisboa).  50 cent surcharge for debit is annoying."}
{"text":"My favourite Portuguese restaurant!
Aside from their chicken being tasty and their generous serving sizes, I love their steamed veggies, parisienne potatoes and fish filet.  I have yet to try their other items.
This place is more a takeaway as opposed to a dine-in.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"It was okay. The chicken I got was dry and the hot sauce was mediocre. If I was in the area I would stop by and have it but nothing I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"I've been on the quest for a month now looking to try different Portuguese Restaurants. 

Came across Nova recommended by fellow Yelpers. I ordered the Family Combo #2 which includes 2 whole chickens, large Potatoes & a large Rice. I also ordered an extra Large Garden Salad. 

Everything with 2 Ginger ales came to $54. Let me just tell you the food value for this price is outstanding!!! We are a family of four with my hubby (who eats for two) and this will last us Two nights dinner.

The Salad was very fresh, rice was good, potatoes were good but a little mushy. Chicken was okay but definitely needs the accompanied Piri Piri Sauce.

Place was very clean, service was very friendly and place was constantly busy which means you know the food is being replenished constantly. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious reasonably priced with filling portions. I ordered the chicken ( which was moist and delicious) and my heat level was hot...and boy they weren't messing with the pepper on that. The Rice was delicious and the little round potatoes were packed with flavor."}
{"text":"Bland bland bland. Very disappointing. The rice and potatoes are very bland and the chicken is basic, the hot sauce is also basic and not very hot."}
{"text":"Had it for the first time...definitely going again. Chicken was moist and tender, small place, was really busy on a Sunday but fast service"}
