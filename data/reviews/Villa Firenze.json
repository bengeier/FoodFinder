{"text":"Went here about a week ago on a week night. Wasn't too busy so quickly seated.
Appetizers & the main course were delicious for all four of us. The desserts were ok.
Had much better tiramisou (sp?) much better in other places. Not saying the dessert was bad, just not as wonderful as the rest of the meal. Would definitely go back again in future."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant!  The food is delicious (especially the mushroom appie) and I love the quiet and elegent feel to the place.  It's great!"}
{"text":"Another Italian restaurant in my neighbourhood, Bridgeland, which provides excellent service and consistently good food. 

While my wife prefers the 'competition' up the road, I prefer the Villa! The restaurant is cosy and there is a larger room for large noisy italian-like gatherings! The italian menu is varied and the food exquisitely prepared and presented. Great wine list and great desserts on offer. 

What more can I say? You will have to drive there. I simply walk which means I can end the evening with a  Grappa and Expresso! 

The Villa is well worth a visit."}
{"text":"My work's Christmas party has been held here the past two years and I am definitely impressed. It was a set menu, but everything was delicious. Their portobello mushrooms in the brandy cream sauce and the stuffed veal were divine. The red table wine was delicious. My water glass was never empty. When I asked for tea instead of coffee I got my own cute little teapot. They let us play games and basically take over the room.  Both the food and service are A-1.
I can't talk about the menu (because I've never seen it), but everything we had was delicious, including the tiramisu. I would love to go again on a regular day to check it out."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times and have never once been disappointed. 

The food is delicious and the service is first rate.  The prices are reasonable and, in fact, very reasonable given the quality of food. When we get a craving for great Italian food, great service, and a great atmosphere, we go here."}
{"text":"I made a reservation at Villa Firenze for my boyfriend's birthday. I found myself googling best Italian restaurants in Calgary and stumbled upon Villa, a restaurant I had never heard of despite living in Calgary for years. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a friendly face, our jackets and belongings were taken and we were directed to our table. They had set us up with a quieter corner table for two which was ideal for conversation.
Our server promptly came by once we were seated. She knew her menu and was also a pleasure to chat with. We ordered some appetizers to start - their portobello mushroom appetizer that is spoken highly of and bruschetta. Our bruschetta came out first and it wasn't as good as I had hoped. It was unfortunately a bit burnt and far too crunchy for my liking. The portobello mushroom appetizer was excellent and made up for the bruschetta. 
Onto the mains! I had wanted their chicken but instead of the side the chicken came with, I had hopes of substituting it with a side of their gnocchi. Sadly our server said that I would have to order two mains to get both chicken and gnocchi (they have gnocchi as a main and chicken as a main with a side) and they couldn't sub a smaller portion of gnocchi for the chicken side. OK, well, that's a lot of food and I would be getting a side I didn't want but I was set on trying their gnocchi out. If I could make a suggestion, it would be working on menu flexibility - being able to make substitutions or have the menu not as set in stone would be great. Our server did mention at the point of my request that the kitchen was busy - understandable. We had arrived at evening peak hour.
Our server wasn't kidding - they must have been extremely busy or ran into some issues as we were waiting for what seemed like an hour after finishing our appetizers for our main dishes. It was an awkward amount of time. Our server did come by a couple of times to apologize. Things happen.
Our mains arrived and their portions are huge. My (two) mains were good but just good - nothing to write home about. My date had a veal dish that he wasn't a fan of and he mentioned some type of texture could have been added to the dish - breaded, crusted, something. He had a side sausage which he liked.
Overall, the ambience and staff were great. The restaurant itself is beautiful and full of character. The staff are excellent. The food... not so much. Average, run of the mill. The atmosphere was their saving grace but let's be honest - people go out to eat to eat, not for the wall texture and decoration. Also, I'm not sure if we were there on an off night, but less of a wait time between courses would have made our experience better."}
{"text":"I was here for a large work party, and I was very impressed! 

First off, I love the architecture of this place. Definitely has the 'villa' feel to it.

We were in the large back room because it was a private function. The service was excellent. My wine was constantly topped up before I was even halfway through my glass. Dangerous, yes. But fun!

The food was great. We had fried red peppers as table snacks, and it was delicious!! I have never had red peppers fried crispy like that - and I like it! We had veal, shrimp, bruschetta, and an amazing creamy portobello mushroom dish. The sauce was heavenly, and was excellent to dip the bread into! I hear it is not on their regular menu though. Their tiramisu was good too, but I was a tad too umm.. 'wine-d up' by then to really remember it. 

All in all, I will definitely go back to have a regular meal here!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed scampi, 5 of 6 great, one dead and mushy

Veal in ham rolled around cheese wit a peppercorn sauce was more of a salt sauce 

Next time I will try the pasta"}
{"text":"Came here upon a friends recommendatiion.  He was salivating just telling me I had to order the mushroom special and save the foccacia bread to dip into the sauce.  Needlessly to say, we ordered the dish and did as told.  The waiter was nice enough to have the kitchen split the portebelllo mushroom for us and serve it on two separate plates too!  Overall, I thought the appetizer dish was good but the sauce could have used more salt and it was actually very rich so I couldn't finish the whole half portion, but I can see how someone easily could.  :).  For dinner, I ordered the penne w arrabiata sauce and sausage.  Sausage was a bit on the dense side though it had a lot of flavor, but I enjoyed the pasta and sauce.  It was cooked perfect.  My friend got shrimp with spinach linguine which was also very good.   We both have hearty appetites but had to take home our left overs.  Besides that, we appreciated the friendly service, thought the space was nice, and they even had free WiFi. :)."}
{"text":"If you happen to enter the large wooden door of Villa Firenze you're in for a treat. 
From with a friendly staff and fresh baked in house hot bread to the quinoa penne pasta and the amazing dried red peppers made by chef Joe- you won't be disappointed."}
