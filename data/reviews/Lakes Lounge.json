{"text":"The hidden gem in Summerlin!   This is a little restaurant (separated from the gaming side) hidden by the Lake in Summerlin. We didn't expect much from this place but after reading the great reviews and it being so close to our home we had to try it.  IT WAS GREAT. Here's why...... - Friendly staff! Always smiling and it's a relief to see people working in F&B in Las Vegas that look like they are genuinely happy. - The food. I'm sorry to say but I didn't expect great food. I was mistaken. Everything we tried was pretty dang good. The breakfast burrito was great. The club sandwich was huge and great tasting. The quesadilla was maybe my favorite I've ever had, with the peppers inside, the crema on top and it wasn't greasy at all. Corn beef hash was also good. The eggs and bacon may be the downfall for them. They seem like they are instant and the bacon was majorly overcooked. Looking forward to trying the chicken pot pie and some other things there! - Price. It is VERY fair.  This place feels like a little local spot back home for us. So for that and the other reasons I listed, we will be coming back...... a lot. =)"}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time and was pleasantly surprised.  Hidden in the lakes,  a gaming lounge with separate dining area.  Dark and cozy,  small dining area with one server and one busser. I had their corned beef and cabbage with Irish potatoes and carrots.  It was served with soup or salad.  Portion size was hefty as I took home a third of it for later.  The corned beef had a lot of flavor and the sides were soft not mushy.  My husband had the prime rib dip which included some green peppers and onions to add for a more flavorful sandwich.  It came with sweet potato tater tots which was delicious.  Service was fast and friendly and the gaming side looked rather busy too.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is good, the prices are reasonable and the service is EXCELLENT! I highly recommend this place. Never miss coming here every time we're in town. Happy New Year to all personnel working at this place. You guys ROCK!!"}
{"text":"Best ribs in the area. The ribs are the special on monaday. Fall off the bone greatness and a pile of fries. Doesn't get much better for the cost"}
{"text":"Can I just take a second to love this place and all holes-in-the-wall like it?! Where else can you get two AMAZING steaks, drinks, dessert, and leave with the bill never topping out at more than $25?!   The thing about The Lakes Lounge is that you'll never see a patron under the age of 55. The place is full of older people with plain, weird, old-people decor but it's also quiet, dark and low-key. However, that's not why we go. THE FOOD IS AMAZING AND CHEAP!! Honestly, this has become our favorite place to eat. We have never gone here once and been disappointed. Try the sweet potato tots, pot-pie, and steak: all amazing. If you can get passed the fact that you're surrounded by nothing but AARP memebers, you won't regret trying this place."}
{"text":"Just had an interesting  almost lunch with my dad at lakes lounge my dad is 80 years old  he asked if they could put closed caption  on the TV they said no the owner was sitting right behind us he said closed caption  was to big of a distraction  of course it's on the sports channels which show stats and all kinds of lettering i said i didn't understand  Jamie the owner agrees with this and Jamie snapped yes so I decided  to do a yelp  review he was listening  to our conversation  got up grabbed my father's plate and told him \" get the fuck out of here \" my father was shocked he said fine i want a box for my food Jamie told the food server to call the police then whoever Jamie was sitting  with said oh they got there free food we left money under the plate WHAT kind of owner tells senior  citizens  to get the fuck out THE OWNER OF LAKES LOUNGE  NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN"}
{"text":"The food is tasty and better than what I expect when going to a local bar. When I complimented the blue cheese dressing, our waitress told us it was made there fresh, and that quality seemed to extend to everything we ordered. In my experience the service is usually not that great, though."}
{"text":"always there when I get off work and need a nice sandwhich to feel me up. Nice staff and love the view of the lake"}
{"text":"service is excellent.  food exceeds the service.  all fresh, no frozen anything except the ice cream on my brownie desert that capped off and complimented my dinner. prices are ideal and definitely felt that i got more than what i was charged for.  this was my first visit, and it is now at the very top of my list in vegas.  had the chicken pot pie and my friend had the fish tacos. looking forward to going through the entire menu as every selection seemed like it was something i would enjoy."}
{"text":"Great food. Perfect eggs. Good ambience.  Cheap! Friendly staff. Sis and I had been hitting up Vegas for a few days. Vegas has got a lot to offer in shopping and shows, but it's always loud unless you're in the room, so we Yelped off-strip for a breakfast place and found this. It looks funky from the outside with mirrored/toned windows, but never mind that. It's nice and clean inside. They're open 24/7, it says, but we were only there for breakfast. Good enough that we came back the next morning (18 mins off-strip) before leaving town. Bill for two? 'Round $20."}
{"text":"Winner!! My husband found the hidden place while working in the area. I had the $6.99 steak and egg, my husband had the country fried steak. His eggs were perfectly cooked and so was my steak. We will most definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times in the last month.  Very good comfort food.  Quiet, pleasant, excellent air quality!  Daily specials are all exceptional considering the cost.  Kinda reminds me of the old Las Vegas days when good food was not breaking the bank.  They also have draft pints (stout, amber) for $2.50 during happy hour - every day!  It's perfect.........small and intimate.  OK - please be sure to leave me seat for next time.  Jimi says check it out!"}
{"text":"This used to be a family favorite but not anymore! Poor service due to being understaffed. Food also used to be amazing but they have started skimping on quality lately. It's too bad. We really enjoyed coming here until recently."}
{"text":"The only reason i don't give it 5 stars is the bar, it's just not as good as the restaurant. The restaurant is awesome and that's an understatement!! Great food, great service, UNDER priced!!!! This is my go to spot, love the lakes!!!"}
{"text":"We've eaten here 4-5 times in the last 6 months.  Food is always good, service too.  It is much nicer decor than one would expect from the outside.  The dining area has booths and tables and under 21's can eat as it is glass walled off from the bar area.  Bar is compact but sufficient.  Great place if you live nearby."}
{"text":"Went on Saturday evening last week, wait staff consisted of one young female, male and a bus boy which all were inattentive to say the least, didn't want to make eye contact with myself and husband, an older gentleman and another couple just to let us know we'd be seated shorted. It was busy almost a full house one table that could seat four sat dirty for the ten minutes we waited and/or to be acknowledged for seating and another table that could sit two that was clean wasn't offered. Finally a couple left a booth in the back the elder gentleman decided to walk over and seat himself at the \"dirty\" booth - table to get served?! The  male waiter cleaned the table that could sit four at which another booth became available..we all finally got eye contact with the option to sit either seats. We ordered drinks with the female waitress whom by the way took another seven minutes to bring us  water, she informed us that the male server would take our order. The male server came over I ordered buffalo wings and potatoe skins, my husband ordered fish and chips, we waited and waited and waited people that were seated after us got their food so for about 20 minutes or more go by finally catching our servers attention after passing us by numerous times, I asked him, with my credit card in hand to bring boxes with the food and bring the check now, he half assed apologized with the excuse \"yeah I was wondering why it was taking so long for your food, the cook just informed me that YOUR ticket blew out the window! \"My comment to him after my husband stormed out completely insulted and upset was \"Well that happened, I guess you'll be eating that meal then.\" The service is the worst I have experienced in Las Vegas as a resident...we have gone there for the food it is good bit let's face it I'm paying truly for service!!! Hats off to the two servers of that evening...because of the inability to provide customer service as well as insult our intelligence we no longer can patronize the establishment."}
{"text":"This is not a fancy place but it is a great value and the food tasted very good. the staff is friendly and try to please."}
{"text":"Wish I could keep it at short as possible. Nothing bad whatsoever on the menu. Service is okay. Highly recommend this place if you're looking for something low-key, reasonably priced and huge portions."}
{"text":"Great local place to go for breakfast. Inexpensive and huge portion sizes. Great service too. Sue is wonderful!"}
{"text":"What has happened at the Lakes Lounge?  We go there a lot but last night was terrible!  First of all it took the staff a very long time to even take the order and then we waited a very long time for dinner.  1 order was pot roast which was a special. It was just ok with the vegetables being just warm. Another order was the steak sandwich which is also a special.  The steak was ordered medium rare as it is usually cooked too much but last night the medium rare was done!  The steak had more than its share of grizzle!  Good thing Coleslaw came with steak sandwich which is generally good and a side of mixed vegetables was order which were very good.  At least the coleslaw and vegetables could be eaten!  This will be one restaurant that goes on the back burner.  There are too many good restaurants to choose from so this one goes to the bottom!  Also it's part of Ellis Island which is terrific!  Get it together people!!"}
{"text":"So they just got done redoing this place and it looks way better. It has a restaurant portion and a bar area. This is a great place to enjoy a Finger Cordon Bleu. It's a chicken served up to whatever hotness you want and topped with swiss cheese, ham served on a toasted bun, served up with some fat fries.   My suggestion get it hot, with cheddar cheese instead of swiss and forget the ham and ask them to serve it up with some onion rings instead. It is awesome, they have a lot of repeat customers, cause the server knows a lot of the names of the people dining and the customers know the servers name. You cant beat that.   The menu is your common all american menu with steak, burgers, sandwiches and some pasta."}
{"text":"I'll give you 3 stars, everything anyone else in my group got was great,  I ordered the stout and steak medium, worst stout ever, had everyone at the table try it, no one could drink it,  same with the steak,  I have steak at a lot of places and in my entire life have never put anything on a steak,  I eat it as it comes,  no added anything,  until tonight."}
{"text":"Great food. We went there late night. We were skeptical, but the food really hit the spot and was on point. Will come back here"}
{"text":"Oh yeah, of like coming here for their specials and low priced menu. For being very affordable, the quality and the quantity of the food will not disappoint.  It's a favorite among senior citizens, but I see all other age groups come here as well.  I love the Ribeye Steak, and I come on Fridays or Saturdays for the Prime Rib special.  Oh so delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place the salads the extra dirty martini omg I cant get enough the people are really sweet and the place is really clean stars straight across"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall with great food.  Video poker pays decent and James is the man to see behind the bar.  Russ is cool too.  Just a great neighborhood place... the kind of bar you don't find in Vegas very often."}
{"text":"3/23 9am party of 4 - Breakfast today everything was perfect food and service. We will be back for sure... Secret hide out..."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find a restaurant near grandparents for lunch.  This place was great. Don't let the \"lounge\" name, the out of the way location or the secret dual door thing fool you. This is good, fresh food and a friendly staff. Our table had the fish and chips and the pot pie, both were winners.  We definitely have a regular spot when visiting the grandparents in what I like to call \"the other Vegas\"."}
{"text":"Older bartender that works here has the worst customer service that I have ever experienced!"}
{"text":"Here for breakfast again.  The steak and eggs for 6.99 is so damn good.   Friendly staff and full bar makes this place great anytime of day or night.   Also recommend the cheeseburger soup.  Yum."}
{"text":"Been going there for years. Their daily specials are a great deal. Service is always good."}
{"text":"The burgers here are REALLY good, you can basically build your own fresh grilled burger and they will make it for you :) loved it!"}
{"text":"This place makes my favorite chicken fingers!!! So delicious and tasty!!! I like to mix the honey mustard with ranch. So good.   My boyfriend and I used to frequent here more often when Dale was the bartender. All new people now. Didn't even see new Mark last time. :( I'll still go though cuz they have the best chicken fingers in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is a well hidden restaurant in the Lakes. I have been to this restaurant several times. It has a restaurant and bar entrance. The food is ok - nothing special. I enjoy their fish and chips and sweet potato tater tots. But, even this food favorite has resulted in inconsistent cooking results. Sometimes it is crispy and sometimes it is a little on the soggy side.   The Lounge runs some great daily specials, but I find that their food is generally oozing with butter and various other oils.  The service is spotty."}
{"text":"Fourth visit. Tonight with 4 of us. 1 Wednesday's special, pot roast. 1 cod, 1 fish and I had chicken fingers. Also large onion rings that we shared. Pot roast was great. All 4other items/meals were really greasy. They were also over cooked.. fish and cod had to strip breeding off.  Not very good tonight. Summary:  over cooked and very grease. Need a different cook and one that can drain grease before serving."}
{"text":"I have gone to the Lakes lounge several times and been treated poorly (bar side) at least 4 times. I will not return. The culture there is quiet and caters to locals only. I kind of understand that but I live around the corner and would have liked to become a regular there. However, my friend and I have been made to be felt unwelcome Each time we go there. I won't go back at this point. 3 different bartenders have been extremely rude. The last time in I did not tip and told myself that I will not go back. It's too bad!"}
{"text":"Neat little hideaway in front of a manmade lake. I love how the restaurant is separated from the bar, but you can see into the bar. Weekly specials. happy hour. They even had specials for thanksgiving and valentines day,probably more, but i happened to go in during those times. My breakfast burrito was huge=two meals. really friendly service."}
{"text":"Small parking lot.  Small dining room.  Great price.  Decent food.  Friendly service.  I would have given this place 4 stars if the sirloin steak was done better. I loved everything else but the steak itself was not good at all."}
{"text":"Wow!  My wife had this spot on her list for awhile so we went Saturday afternoon.  We sort of assumed that there was some outdoor seating to see Lake Sahara, but that is not the case.  Outside of the complex in general needs an update, but once inside the restaurant it's very pleasant.  I  that they carry Ellis Island brews on tap!!  Menu was much better than expected and has some pretty great variety.  Price was more than fair.  $32 plus tip for more food than we could eat.  Service was average.  My wife had a burger that was cooked nicely to order with steak fries.  I had a build your own fried chicken sandwich that was simply phenomenal with sweet potato tots!  The options to build burgers, and chicken sandwiches allows you to make some killer combos.  Can't wait to come back and try some other menu items.  Will bring friends!"}
{"text":"Great little lounge with oddly great food I was impressed. Had the chicken fried chicken and it was really tasty almost tasted like there was butter in the breeding idk how but it was good."}
{"text":"Been going here for five years and we still love it. Breakfast is great, super fluffy pancakes and delicious Texas Toast French Toast. The biscuits and gravy is also decent. The lakes burger is great, make sure to ask for a side of chicken gravy for your fries!! Saturdays, they serve Cheeseburger soup, sounds weird, but it's fantastic, creamy cheddar soup with beef. Goes great with a cold winter day. We usually order that with the steak and baked potato special. The only downside, is the small amount of space, they for sure need to expand. It can get busy here. One thing I have to appulaud them for, is that they installed a glass window to separate the bar from the restaurant. We are unable to smell cigarettes which is great in my book."}
{"text":"Only second time here and both times I've gotten outstanding service from the bartender Mark. I recommend the chicken caesar if your craving something light."}
{"text":"I live in the area and frequent the lounge quite often. For breakfast I recommend the skillets. The sandwiches and salads are fantastic and the daily specials have all been good. My preference is the prime rib on Fridays and Saturdays. The staff is attentive and they do their best to beat the rush especially on Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"I've tried very hard to like this place - it could be a cozy, nearby go-to place for lunch and dinner.  Unfortunately, in the 7 or 8 times I've tried it there has always been a problem except for that first time about 18 months ago.  Poor tasting food, indifferent service, long waits without attempts to get people seated, and more.  The other night was it - I'm done.  One of their signature dishes is Fried Chicken.  In big red letters it says \"Cooked Fresh to Order.\"  Within 10 minutes of ordering I was served microwaved, hours-old fried chicken.  There's no excuse - I wasn't in a hurry and didn't ask them to hurry.  The chicken was hot on the outside quarter of an inch and cold throughout inside.  After the outside cooled down in a couple of minutes it had the taste that goes with greasy food that has been sitting around for a while so I didn't eat more than a few bites.  I'm done - they are too erratic."}
{"text":"As a business owner myself it saddens me when employees aren't diligent. It's 222am and I wanted to put in a late night order. I've never tried lakes lounge but the reviews look good so I figured hey I'll give them some late night money. Unfortunately NO ONE ANSWERED the phone to take my money. Sucks. I'll buy from another bar in the area that answers the phone 24/7."}
{"text":"Tucked away in The Lakes between Durango and Ft Apache came here because a friend said this place has great food, he was right, the burgers are 100% Black Angus and char broiled, I had the Lake Burger 1/2 pound patty, Swiss cheese, lettuce tomato onion and bacon...delicious the Fish and Chips a must, the portion size is great you get your monies worth and more, steak and eggs served 24/7...beer is cold on draft from a local brewery, open 24 hours...go there you will not be disappointed try the Cheese burger soup."}
{"text":"If you hate money and despise great service then this is the perfect dive for you! If you really want to kick yourself in the nuts, show up on a graveyard shift.   The food is fair to midland, borderline at best and they do have 1 nice bartender.. but if you want to be ignored, and treated second class AND lose money than you shall fit right in here!   The grave bartender Mike wouldn't serve me more than 2 beers after pouring 100 dollars into the machines. And then he continued to ignore me afterwards, only paying attention to the \"high rollers\"(losers blowing away their Roth iras & retirement).  There is a bar on every corner, I would maybe drive to the next watering hole and risk a dui rather than wander in here."}
{"text":"This place is my new spot. It's low key, never crowded, and has really good food for the price. I think I've been here 4 times in the last two months. Everything that I've orderd I enjoyed and it's always been a good experience..."}
{"text":"Dont let the exterior fool you, this place is great!  My husband and I have been going here for years.  We eat breakfast here at least twice a week.  I can say that everything on the menu is delicious because i have tried it all.  We love bringing our 1 year old daughter here, the staff is friendly and the food is yummy.  A must try for sure..."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour. But the happy hour is only done in the dining room area. Not the bar where I sat. Yes I know I did say that right. Happy hour in the dining room only. The bar area has slot machines at every seat and you play for the free drinks. So I guess that could be better than hh depending on your luck. No food on hh anyways only drink specials. The bar is in an airtight room separate from the dining room and they allow smoking in the bar area.   I came for the Wednesday night special which is pot roast. Only $7.99! The salad came out first and it was a large salad. The lettuce was very fresh. Had one cherry tomato on it with croutons. It had a little too much dressing on it for my liking but other than that was great.   The pot roast was very good. Much better than Chicago brewery but not quite as good as lazy dog (but lazy dog is over twice the price).For $7.99 though I'll definitely be coming back for it.   I also had the peanut butter cup pie. $5. Delicious! Way too much food for me though so I took half of the slice home.   One of the regulars there told me the ribs on Monday night are delicious and even better than Lucilles ribs, so I'll be coming back to judge that for myself. I find it hard to believe any place does ribs better than Lucilles but I'll let you know. Lakes lounge seemed to be full of regular locals. It's definitely not a tourist spot. I liked that a lot about the place. Everyone seemed to know each other's name and they were all very friendly. I think I heard someone say this place has been there for 26 years or so.   I'm so full I don't want to eat ever again...Well not until tomorrow at least."}
{"text":"This place is the best. Right by The Lakes, small and dark, and consistently quiet even when it's busy. The same staff have been here forever, like Russ and Darren. Each day is a different featured dinner, and they're all so good they sell out by like 9pm.   Went recently after hearing my bf and his homeboy reminisce and rave about this place after moving away from Vegas, and it did not disappoint.  Ordered the chicken fried chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes with white gravy and a bowl of the French onion soup. And it was all amazing. The chicken was well seasoned, flavorful and moist, the mashed potatoes were better than your grandmas and went perfect with the chicken. The veggies were steamed with a delicious seasoning blend and weren't soggy or overlooked at all. Oh and the French onion soup? It's the best I've ever had. If you've had a bad order of French onion soup, this place will redeem the soup and restore your faith in the tastiness of onions. No joke.  The service is great, there are plenty of TVs to watch a game, and there is zero obligation whatsoever to socialize. Love that- sometimes I want tasty food and/or a drink, but I don't want to look presentable or communicate in any way outside of grunting. This place fits the bill and then some- their house amber is delicious, and the fact that they have their own beers on draft is pretty killer.  Come on Fridays and Saturdays for prime rib, or do Wednesday's pot roast. Come early though, or they'll run out."}
{"text":"The smallest place I've been to in Vegas. Staff is friendly enough I guess. No happy hour which is rare in Vegas. I got the moz and mush chic sandwich. Fantastic. Pretty cheap all things considered. Don't know if I'll become a regular but I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"The best place in town.. Very homey great feeling.. Everything I've tried on menu is incredible!! Great service even better food!!"}
{"text":"#6 for this \"OMG, WHY HAVEN'T I BEEN HERE SOONER\" day of reviews.   I was looking for a new place for dinner with my in-laws. Most of the new places that have opened, while great, don't work for our family dinners because they're too much of one of the following: loud, trendy, expensive, complicated, small-portioned, dark, bright, or crowded.    What I needed was a place where we could sit, chat, and have just straight up good food. I needed a place that was at least a few of the following: relaxed, comfortable, straight forward, well-priced, and with an easy to maneuver menu. I found all of these things in Lakes Lounge and am kicking myself for not having dined there until now.   The restaurant itself is small and oddly shaped, but the tables are laid out very efficiently. Most of the diners when we entered hovered closer to the geriatric end of the age spectrum, but the crowd fluctuated throughout our time there.   We were seated in a booth and were handed menus. My in-laws immediately expressed excitement in the selection of classic food at reasonable prices.   Feeling that one cannot go wrong with the nightly specials, I went for the $14.99 prime rib with a side Caesar salad and a fully loaded baked potato. The Caesar dressing is kicked up with garlic that let me know right away that the restaurant was going to be a part of my regular rotation. When the prime rib was placed in front of me, I squealed, \"oh, wow!\". Aside from looking scrumptious, the portions were more than generous. In fact, I'm writing this review after eating my leftovers for dinner. I especially enjoyed my baked potato, which was smartly layered with the bacon under the cheese *mind explodes*.  My in-laws both ordered the chicken fried steak. I lost count of the number of times they exclaimed some part of their plate was delicious.   My husband ordered the NY steak sandwich, which I believe was less than $7. With perfectly salted fries, it was an absolute winner.   Oh and plus points for the larger than average glasses. I think I only needed a refill on my diet soda once!   What really tied this search up with a bow was the service. Our server was attentive and caring. She checked in on us enough times for us to not feel neglected, but not so much that we felt suffocated. Being that person who is always in the middle of shoving an embarrassing amount of food into my mouth at the perfect time to make eye contact with an approaching server, I appreciate this more than I can explain.   On the list for future visits are the fish n chips (listed on the menu as a 30-year menu specialty), breakfast, and the salmon."}
{"text":"I just moved to the Lakes area and needed something to eat late at night that wasn't Roberto's. Bar food is usually a good option and this place didn't disappoint.   I ordered the fish tacos with a side of cajun fries. The portions were so ridiculously large, I couldn't finish it all. At $4.99, the fish tacos were a steal. They were gigantic! What you get are 3 large fish and chips-style pieces of fried fish served on a tortilla with cole slaw on top. It's not the most Mexican in the world - there is no pico de gallo, cilantro, or anything else you'd expect on a fish taco - but the size and flavor make up for the authenticity. The fries were your basic steak fries with a Cajun-style seasoning. I'm more of a light seasoning type of guy (potatoes taste great on their own, damn it!), so if you're like me you should ask for a light sprinkle next time (but please, call it something a little tougher than \"a light sprinkle\") To add to the allure, their $2 happy hour specials (3pm - 7pm) are great and include Ellis Island beer on tap. The bartender was really nice and attentive to my needs and everyone else in the bar at the time. I will definitely come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the bartenders especially my girls Stephanie & Daniela! Best place to hang out any night of the week!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is great and reasonably priced, ambiance is dark and employees are friendly. The restaurant is attached to a bar, but surrounded by glass walls so you don't get any of the smoke or hear any of the noise. I wouldn't say this is a family friendly place (no kids menus or anything) but we do bring our 1.5 year old and they have high chairs.  Everything I've eaten here has been *mostly* delicious. I say mostly because a few times certain items were not good. Like the rice pilaf. It was more like dried out Rice-A-Roni that was cold and crunchy. And more often than not, they barely put any butter on my toast. You can see the effort they put into it in my pictures. Other than that, the food is really good and it comes out fast! They have a rotating dinner specials every day of the week with comfort foods like pot roast and baked chicken. And they have prime rib on weekends. Some of my fav items are the bbq bacon cheeseburger, salmon with lemon garlic butter, and the sweet potato tots. Also the ranch is bomb so make sure to get some of that on the side."}
{"text":"A favorite place of ours and Wednesday is Special. The Pot Roast is Delicious as always"}
{"text":"Their food is reasonably priced and their portions are HUGE! I'm an eater and I need a to-go box every time!"}
{"text":"Great $2.50 Ellis island brews during happy hour  honestly everything was great. Really nice waitress, great food, awesome ranch, chill ambiance. We can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"Very good food for a bar type venue... Walking through the smoke filled bar was a turn, off but I was pleased there was a separation between the smoking area and the food service.   Do restaurant/bars like this think non-smokers do not enjoy playing a little with the slot machines or drinking? I guess they do, as I could not play, even if I wanted to with the horrible smoky environment.   Fish & Chips was ordered well done... Extremely good for bar type food.   Tartar sauce was very tasty.   Coleslaw was just ok  Onion rings were great.   Tequila Sunrise was good... Would have been better with Alien Tequila.   Atmosphere is pretty simple & generic, so the 4 star is based on the food."}
{"text":"I've only been to the bar area late at night but this place never really disappoints.  The bartenders are really cool and personable, the drinks are well-poured and cheap, and the food is delicious and comes in huge portions.  It is also only a 3 minute walk from my friends apartment which is also a huge plus.  I wish there was a place like this over in Henderson."}
{"text":"The breakfast chicken fried steak at midnight on a Tuesday after work is amazing!  Mark the grave Bartender is outstanding.!"}
{"text":"Lakes Lounge is a nice little bar and restaurant kind of hidden in the Lakes community. We always used to come in for the steak and eggs special they have all day. Only 6.99 and you get potatoes with peppers, eggs, toast, and a steak cooked to your liking. I also add the biscuits and gravy because their gravy is great. We have stopped going as much recently because the quality of the steaks have gone down or the chef who is making the steaks doesn't pay attention to how the customer wants their steak cooked. I always get a medium steak and the last couple times we visited its always well done and tough. I even tried ordering medium rare and still didn't change. I hope they fix whatever it is they need to fix because I really enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"I've been here 50 times now and I can say for the most part the food is pretty good. Solid prices as well. But over 4 years time the staff has gotten worse and they take their time doing everything. EVERY TIME AND I MEAN EVERY TIME I go in to place a to go order I'm greeted like I'm wasting their time. Why have take out if you are just gonna act like it's an inconvenience? I'm sure I'll be back for the food but it sucks that the service never improves."}
{"text":"Our first time trying this place and my Caesar salad was soggy and nothing special. The calamari was chewy and way overcooked. My husband got the steak sandwich and really liked it. He said the fries were delicious and I agreed. I got the steak and baked potato. The portions were great and my food was tasty, as well. Once we got past the sad appetizer portion of the meal, we were happy. We'll be back, we'll just order entrees only.  Service was great and food was fast. Relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went there a couple months ago and had the chicken pot pie. It was not as good as previous times I have ordered it. There were only 3 to 4 small pieces of chicken in the pie! The server said she could bring me more chicken to place in it myself - I declined and didn't finish the pie. Three of us went back on a Sunday night and were once again disappointed. Two of us ordered the Turkey special and the other ordered the Sirloin steak. The Turkey dinner was terrible. They gave us pieces of DRY Turkey that were approximately 1-2 inches thick instead of thinner slices that you would cut yourself. The stuffing was marginal and the gravy was bland. I recall this being a good dinner in the past. The Sirloin steak was overcooked and TOUGH! We didn't finish any of our dinners and took them home to the dog. (she seemed to like them!) Hopefully the ribs are still good as we are going back again on a Monday to order them. The ribs were always the best special,(IMHO). If the ribs turn out to also be a bust, that will be my last trip to The Lakes Lounge. It's a pity because it was always the place you could go to and be assured of a good meal. I am bummed to have to write this marginal review for a place I have frequented for years,but something is wrong there and needs to be fixed."}
{"text":"Talk about a nice little hidden gem of a spot in The Lakes area. One very much off the beaten path if not familiar with the area. Thankfully after solid OWS training day with a friend he recommended hitting the Lake Lounge for some recovery meal. Am always down for trying new places more so ones that friends recommend!   Talk about never judge book by its cover. Cause literally on the outside you have no idea what your walking into just outside of building not windows or anything tell the inside of it. They do have two doors clearly marked one for the bar and one for the restaurant. We came for the food so never walked into the bar. Talk about going from day light to darkness. Dam. The place is dark but not in bad way. It definitely gives the place personality, the art work on the walls all are different, lot of booths, kind of gives feel of old school vegas non strip restaurant, and reminded me of places like Golden Steer or even Hugo Cellars dark in general. If the place is dark the workers are complete opposite. Everyone was friendly, positive, all smiles, got feeling they all worked there for long time, attentive, and next thing know was talking with our waiter about random stuff. Cool.  The prices. Really for the most part everything on the menu is under ten dollars. Couple things that are over but they are few and far between. Not only are the prices great but the food is GOOD. The thing is look at the menu it basic bar food (they also serve breakfast items ; outside of the steak and eggs they do stop serving breakfast at one point) but done right. The portion size are HUGE! I know thinking cheap and huge portion might not be good combination. I had the fish and chips. The pieces of cod they use are nice nice cut not small scrap pieces of fish more batter then fish. The batter don't get me wrong is full one but not super dense or fell eating more batter then fish. It nice crispy even by the time finally got around to my third piece. Light batter. Golden brown. The cod on the inside cooked perfect, moist, seasoned, and hot. Really one of the best fish and chips in Vegas. You see them in just about every menu especially in bar food but more times then not nothing rave about. The fish and chips are up there for me. The french fries nothing really special. They were well seasoned and hot.   My friends both had steak and eggs. I can not attest to the taste. Just living in Vegas for over twenty years. The first couple years did the whole graveyard specials and looking for cheap steak and eggs. Honest tell you this steak and eggs are BY FAR............steal of deal. The steak is totally legit not look like cheap meat. They put perfect grill mark on it. It nice and juicy. No doubt will be the next thing try.   Mahalos to my friends for showing me this little hole in the wall or dive bar. If looking for great deal, great food, and in the area. Lakes Lounge is the spot!!! I will be back..."}
{"text":"I sat myself. Was greeted by a girl who took my drink order. The drink came immediately. I sat and waited 7 minutes until I saw someone who resembled a waitress. She then took a large party order who was seated AFTER me. I am on a time restriction with my lunch time so I verbalized this to the waitress after I placed my order (at this point I couldn't down the Caesar salad because I wouldn't have enough time to eat it so I opted for the side salad.) The salad came out immediately with the check. A diet coke and a side salad was $5.38 I would come back when I have more time to try something else. This trip served its purpose."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Lakes Lounge for 10+ years on a quite frequent occasion.  Within the past 6 months or so I noticed they have a new GM and I have noticed that the servings are getting smaller and smaller.  Tonight was the fish and chips and though it is reasonably priced the size was almost funny small for fish and chips.  I love the people and the food here but if this is what a new GM does to a GREAT business maybe he's not the right guy for the job.  Not always about the $ but sometimes it's about having a great little hideaway locals joint."}
{"text":"I must say the food here was boring. Nothing exciting. I had heard that the prime rib was excellent, but That special is only on Fridays and Saturday's and I went on another day. Figured it would be good. The service was excellent and the diner was clean, but the food it the problem. Super bland and boring."}
{"text":"We went to the Lakes Lounge for a late supper. The restaurant was closed so we ate in the bar. We got 2 Bloody Mary's, the steak sandwich, and the fish and chips. Not quite what we had anticipated based on the previous reviews. There is a saying we have been learning since moving to Vegas and that is you get what you pay for. Well, we paid $25 bucks, so.... Needless to say we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place went down hill. I took my daughter who was visiting from hawaii. We brag about the food. Oh to our surprise shell in my scampi couldnt eat it . My daughters chicken an mushroom dried out. How embarrassing. So the manager came over blonde from bar who we see all the time and usually takes care of us . No rude rude. To the owner time to fire get a new manager. She the bartender manager has no respect for that place. Nor herself. Please listen think . Time to revamp to get more people there. We love close to our home in summerlin but wont return until you train or revamp emplyees thanks"}
{"text":"Their Chicken strips were awesome (The batter on the chicken was so tasty). Their Cheeseburgers are grilled to perfection. We liked the cheese quesadilla a lot too. I like this eatery for it's comfortable booths and great food. There's nothing fancy about this place but it's very comfortable. There is a gaming bar next door that you can see through a glass separation and there are lots of TVs around to fix your gaze.   Tip: If you're lactose shy, don't get the Pot Pie...it's very creamy. Also, this place gets super packed around 5 and on weekends. If you can, stop by on the off peak hours for the best experience.   This place is a winner, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Always fresh excellent food. Staff is always friendly and service is always quick. I usually frequent here on the weekends for breakfast. The place is usually always very busy during that time! This is definitely one at the top of my list for best breakfast spots!!"}
{"text":"4/5 Cute little place! Their menu is pretty vast considering how small they seem. They have a bar section and a dining section separated by a wall.  We got the calamari, California burger, steak & eggs, chips & salsa, and garlic bread. Everything was super good! The sweet potato tots are as good as everyone said.  Food was flavorful, crispy, and exceptional.  I had my steak well done and it wasn't overly dry or chewy like how it's mostly served when I request it well done.  Would definitely go back again :) We got A LOT of food for two people and had to get a couple to-go boxes.  Pricing was fair. Good place to have a meal that'll fill you up!"}
{"text":"Fun neighborhood place. We always go as a group on Mondays for the baby back rib special. This is not gourmet, just good food. The ribs are so tender they practically fall off the bone. The special includes salad, baked beans, fries, and corn on the cob. Great service too."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. A little hole-in-the-wall restaurant on the Lakes. They are attentive. The food is inexpensive and great. Love their Friday/Saturday prime rib special!"}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place to go . but not anymore ...the service absolutely sucks. Today I witness three heavy set people walking in and asked if they could have the large both in the back this new bus person very tall guy said no that is for a larger party the customer said I can't sit anywhere else .....this bus person made sure everybody heard in the dining okay well whatever just take the table ......it just made me sick it was 9:30 in the morning the place was pretty busy. But nobody was sitting at that table..... what was the big deal why did he have to embarrass this family because they were large and they wanted the larger table not cool. And the gentleman was very embarrassed. . everybody heard it and he turned around and just completely walked away from these three people ...also one waitress cannot handle a room by herself I'm really thinking she just wants to be by herself she wants all the money we got up and walked out I'm really am done with this place even though the food is good not coming back.. and this was my restaurant I used to come in at least twice a week. At one time I wanted to buy it well if I owned it there would be two waitresses and I get rid of that bus person immediately"}
{"text":"Love this hidden treasure in the Lakes. I like to come here and watch the football game on Sundays.  The food and drinks are great. Service is always fast friendly. I can walk home so I don't have to drive. Atmosphere is nice and relaxing.  People who come here are nice."}
{"text":"Amazing how fast the service is, we went with a group of 11 and the food was out within 10-15 minutes. Very friendly staff, food is always good. The price is very reasonable, especially for breakfast. If your into sports there are flat screen TV's all around the dining room, dining room is small and quaint which is fine. Some people complain about the dimness of the dining room but you get used to it, you may squint your eyes on your way out. There is a bar on the other side separated by a glass barrier so you don't get smoke in the dining room while you eat. Good drinks too, also reasonable in case you want more than breakfast."}
{"text":"Been here a coupe times.  Definitely a little hidden gem. Would have never know  it was there unless someone else told you about it or a regular on yelp.  The wait staff nice and attentive. The food is a step above what you would expect from a bar/lounge.  I had the prime rib(one of the specials.)  Nice cut and a nice medium rare. My friend had the fish and chips.  Both portions were nice and big and the drink prices were good."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular spots to stop at in vegas,  in the lakes area of Summerland .  Great local spot, the food is always good ,its very resonably priced, and the wait staff is always nice.  If you go early you can get great priced bloody marys.  Of you decide to gamble you can go into the separate room where you can smoke, drink, and gamble as much as you want."}
{"text":"Came here based on a recommendation from a friend. Did not disappoint. Its a small 'lounge' just as the name describes. It is half restaurant and half bar. It was oddly dark inside on such a sunny day. But it was cool and comfortable. We were able to seat ourselves and our server came over pretty quick. Service was great, actually. The place was pretty full, and seemed to be mostly regulars. They greeted people by name, which was nice. The food was solid. Cooked quickly and tasted good! If I lived nearby, I would probably become one of the regulars."}
{"text":"I live right across the street from this place. I've been coming here since I was a kid and I always come back! I've had friends work there that enjoyed it and I always love being here. There's consistency and you know what to expect from this place. The food is delicious no matter what you get and the team are all so friendly. I've only been in the bar once, but it was a great time! I'm so happy this place is still around!"}
{"text":"Great food , great prices, got the N.Y steak and eggs for 6.99 can't go wrong with that . Cooked perfectly . The service is excellent and the atmosphere is quaint and quiet. Walking distance from our apartment . Glad I'm a regular. Treat yourself and go to this lakes gem."}
{"text":"Take it down. Let's start a campaign to take the black boarder down the just put up between the bar and restaurant.it sucks. You feel blocked in and now can't see the games on in the bar."}
{"text":"This hidden gem definitely caters to locals. From the outside, one might be concern about going in with the tinted windows and two front doors to have to enter. Once inside the restaurant side, it's a nice relaxing, clean, and updated vintage ambience. Waitresses are great. Food came out timely. People are friendly.  I ordered the chicken pot pie. Superb! Hands down delicious. The crust is light and crispy. Their fillings are just perfect -- not too heavy. They're also known for their fish and chips -- known for 25 yrs : )  Will go back here again if I'm craving for the pot pie and am in the area."}
{"text":"They had me at $2.50 mimosas! I've been wanting to check this place out for years as I only live 2 miles away. I finally dragged my adult kids in with me to try it out and I'm so happy I did. Everything was flavorful and you can't beat the price. This will definitely be my new spot!"}
{"text":"There are two separate sides, and from the outside it looks closed but it's open 24/7! My boyfriend & I first walked into the bar but wanted to be in the dining room. We walked out the door and into the dining room door. It is quite small but very homey. The seats in the booth were not connected to the ground so be careful when you sit down if seated at a booth.  We ordered the French Onion Soup - extremely cheesey, if that's what you're into. Very flavorful broth. We also ordered the chicken quesadillas to share w/ regular grilled chicken but there is an option for blackened chicken. The cheese outweighed the chicken by too much but the salsa was good & they also give you guacamole & sour cream!  For our main entrees, I ordered the Apple Pecan salad & added a beautiful, tender, amazing piece of NY steak for just $5 extra dollars. The vinaigrette was awesome, salad was fresh & crisp. Loved it. My boyfriend ordered their 10 oz. Sirloin Steak. The cook on the steak was perfect & no steak sauce was needed.   Great food for the right price!! If you're looking for a late night spot, NOT in a casino & not overpriced, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. Very friendly staff food is spot on perfect. I would eat here everyday if I could. They can do no wrong when it comes to food. Bar is separate area than the dining so you can bring your kids. Kinda hidden but that adds to the adventure."}
{"text":"Sunday night bartender.  Not a good fit.  Food took too long. He was rude. I live around the corner And usually there is a friendly face. Not tonight"}
{"text":"I have coming here for the past 25 years. Always great! Monday night ribs and chicken noodle soup , daily steak sandwich special, chicken franchese, and linguine & clams are some of our favorites."}
{"text":"You're not going to find a better Swiss Cheese & Mushroom Burger in Vegas without some Celebrity Chef name on it and pay &20.00."}
{"text":"My neighborhood bar that never disappoints. Great drink prices. Great food specials. Machines treat me pretty good too!! The bartenders are all good at what they do, my friends and I choose to come when we know Stephanie is working. She's always been good to us and never lets my glass go dry. She made stopping in to grab a drink on the way home into an all night affair and no, that's not a complaint."}
{"text":"Winner!  Great value! Atmosphere Yes! Clean and modern-yes! Good food and service -yes! Easy parking-yes! Tender sirloin steak with lovely soup, potato and vegetable medley, only $15. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Great American pub. Restaurant is separate from bar so there is no smoke. Food excellent. Very reasonable prices. It is a super place to get a bite without breaking the bank. The food is fresh and prepared well. Most recently had the fish tacos. Delic. Hubby had the fish and chips. 3 large fillets with steak fries. A good go to place."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 14 plus year's, but recently everything seems to have deteriorated and no one in the place seems to care one way or the other. Last night we picked up food to bring home and the chicken in the salad was seared but raw! (see picture attached) When my son returned the salad, the General managers response was \"well, very few people actually get sick from eating raw chicken!\" There's a 12 to 72 hour incubation period for salmonella. I hope he's right, either way, my entire family and kids that now take their families are done with the lakes lounge. What kind of attitude is that?......"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall bar literally around the corner from our new place. Decided to stop in around 930pm on a Saturday night -- we found great prices on drinks, food, ++ the service in the bar was helpful & friendly. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna put this up as a \"hidden locals gem\" review.  We went once about 4 months ago with neighbors and were pleasantly surprised, then never returned till yesterday for some unknown reason.  This is a small restaurant (seats maybe 35-or so) with a partitioned off gambling bar attached.  It is located is a small strip center in the Lakes area just to the south of Sahara.  Menu is diverse and the daily specials are worthwhile.   I tried the 8 oz steak sandwich with steak fries for $6.99 and it was surprisingly good.  I should mention that the happy hour is 3-7 and beer, wine and mixed drinks are all $2.50!  Service was on point and we left happy and full for exactly $20 bucks including the tip.  What more needs to be said?"}
{"text":"Our new mother-daughter dinner place to go. Food was very good and fast. service was perfect. Definitely recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the good reviews.  We had a poor experience with the food the first time we went there. But this place kept popping up on Yelp so we thought we probably just hit it on a bad night. It was a Friday night, the food was over cooked and dry, yada, yada. So let's try it out on a Monday. Guess what, the fried chicken and the fish and chips were overcooked and dry. It wasn't that busy so I guess they just have a lousy cook. Well, scratch that one off the list."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the location is great. More on that in a minute.  Upon arriving we sat ourselves as the sign said and our bus boy/ drink runner came to the table right away to get the drink order and drop the menus..  Our waiter showed up minutes later and told us the specials.  I chose the calamari, side salad and fish and chips as the menu said it is a guest favorite.  The salad was a good size and very fresh. The calamari seemed very overcooked and a small portion for the price. Maybe it was a new chef? Also, I ordered a side of tartar sauce that never came. The pesto aioli was good but not the same. Also they do not give you lemon wedges with this dish. The fish and chips came with steak fries that were super hot and really good. The fish also had some burned spots that were not so good. I ended up only taking the leftover fries home.  My companion said that their chicken parmesan was good but the noodles were really short.  The space is dimly lit and nicely done although the music is a bit loud and a strange mix of classics and newer dance songs. You can see into the bar next door and see all of their TV's, which were all on sports including the ones in the restaurant.   Our waiter was very pleasant and attractive.  Once outside again, I noticed the water up the walkway. As I have never seen \" the lakes\" I walked up to see it. It is beautiful minus the huge mansions and boats that surrounds it. It is also gated so that you may not go in. It is a great quiet area and was not a bad experience. I would go back and try again."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum... This place is great, for females watching their girlish figure.. And those who are ready to indulge in comfort food.  I usually order a Cesar salad with grilled salmon or shrimp.. It has bar/gaming seats only.. Smokey though...know. For pot pie and fish and chips...It's often packed bc there is tables... sometimes we have to head to porchlight grille... Another great option for late night dining.."}
{"text":"My family and I love this place. Regulars for years!"}
{"text":"The price is right! This is an amazing hole in the wall restaurant and bar. My family and I have been going here since we moved to Las Vegas over 10 years ago. Their menu is great because it isn't just bar food. They have a wide variety of selections and everything is priced extremely well! Every night of the week they have a different special as well. Prime Rib on Fridays and Saturdays. This place is worth a try!   And you have to order their steak sandwhich. $6.99 and its an actual steak (NY Strip) on bread with fried onions. You can't beat it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. It has amazing food for the price.   I am also weary writing this review because I don't want that many people to know about it."}
{"text":"Came here because of all the good reviews. Where to begin?? We come in and wait to be seated. A lady asks how many in the party and then points across the room and says, \"sit there in front of the TV\" ok.. I'm thinking, that's kind of rude, but the food must be amazing, so whatever. I order the steak and eggs and my bf orders the prime rib dip with sweet tater tots. Our server comes and takes our order. He was the most pleasant one, which is why this visit was decent.  The food comes out and looks great! Boy, does looks look deceiving. First, my steak was asked to be rare and it came out well done plus more. It was so tough, I could barely eat it. My bf said his dip wasn't good either. He said the meat wasn't good at all. I was so hungry that I ate my steak drenched in a-1 sauce because it was so tough. I never ate such disappointing food like this and tough steak in my life. The service was slow and they forgot to bring out the rest of our food, so I had to remind them half way through my food. Really disappointed in the food. Felt bad for the server, he was super nice and felt bad to even complain to him because he was so nice."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Excellent prices. Every time I come here I am a completely satisfied customer. Try the pot pie. It's killer. Love this place."}
{"text":"Who knew this place was so popular? From the outside, this lakeside shanty-looking building looks like it should be condemned. But step inside and you'll see a well decorated interior with stone and glass, comfortable booths, large TVs,  and plenty of folks who seem to be regulars.  On the menu are plenty of comfort food items like chicken pot pie ($8.99) and fried chicken ($7.99). With its flaky, golden crust covering a velvety smooth cream sauce with plenty of vegetables and chicken, the pot pie instantly brought back fond childhood memories of eating the dish. Almost as good was the fried chicken dish consisting of half a chicken, each piece hand breaded and fried into a course, well seasoned crust. If you want something healthier, try the Lakes chicken ($10.99). Sauteed in lemon, white wine and butter, it's served with a vegetable medley and rice pilaf.   Located in the Lakes, steps away from Those Guys Pies, this is one place the regulars are probably hoping won't be discovered. Reasonable prices, large portions, and above average food provide plenty of bang for your buck and a reason to return."}
{"text":"I was a little let down. Why would you promote being in the lake if there is NO view of the lake from inside? Bummer! Food was ok. Wasn't awful yet nothing to \"write home\" about. Service was descent and the interior is definitely not what you would anticipate based off the outside appearance. It's much better inside! I love that the bar area is deprecated by large glass windows, keeping the smoke out of the dining area. Probably won't return, just because it was just an uneventful experience overall. It wasn't bad, just BLEH."}
{"text":"Great location,  a bit of an expanded pub food menu. I had the burger, cooked to my liking. My wife and nephew had children parm that they enjoyed.  Sauce was pretty good  great little neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. I had the chicken pot pie and absolutely loved it, while my husband had the fish and chips and loved that meal, too. It was also nice that the restaurant was off the beaten path. Not crowded and not expensive like the places on the main strip."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(134/365) \"Secret Spot in Summerlin\"  Had no idea this place existed!? A 24 hour late night grub spot by Desert Shores/The Lakes!?!? Thanks to Yelp, there is much more to be discovered after living here since 2004.  So just like Kilroy's down in Chinatown, they have a \"buzz-in\" entrance which makes you feel like you're entering some kinda speakeasy joint, but when you step inside, its filled with locals just having a good 'ol time and chatting it up with the staff. Now if you come here with health in mind, your pickings on the menu may be very slim to none.  Went with a Burger(forgot the name) medium rare with sweet potato tots, and wifey ordered a French Dip(I think). Portions here are pretty hefty, but the downfall here is the ability to nail the temperatures for meat. We both requested medium rare and we both got medium to medium well. Maybe I'll order it rare the next time, if there is a next time? We shall see...ALOHA!!!  Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  \uuu/  3 *Great service and huge portions, but don't expect restaurant style food"}
{"text":"Some of the best food around town, and its a 100% local somewhat hidden spot, love it."}
{"text":"Lakes Lounge is entirely clutch. Whenever you can't decide on somewhere to go, Lakes Lounge has your back.  They have so many different options that you can always find something here that you want! The food is great, the atmosphere is nice, and the price is right."}
{"text":"Went here tonight for my sisters birthday after she found this place about a week ago. It's definitely off the beaten path and it's super small but let me tell you this place was AMAZING..! the staff were friendly and prompt. The food was outstanding, and when you go to little places like this you prepare for the worst but the portions were great for the price and it was really good. We ended up taking home a box for each of us and the prices are very reasonable. Will definitely go back again for the pretty scenery and food..!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Had power wrap. Also love steak special.  Coming here for a long time. Also love burgers, pot pie. Especially love pot roast special."}
{"text":"Pros: Not very busy Prompt courteous service, genuinely nice people Peanut Butter Cup Pie (super sweet, slightly salty)  Cons: Worst food I've had in Vegas.(except dessert) Sticky tables.... even sticky beer bottle.  I've had the bookmarked forever based on reviews.  I finally stopped in after a long drive back from the opposite side of town in horrible traffic.  I really just wanted to relax with a cold beer.  There are two doors.  One for the bar. One for the restaurant.  I opened the door to the bar and even though there were only 5 people in there I gagged at the smoke so I decided to have a beer and a bite in the restaurant.  That's exactly what I had.  Next day I'm still sick to my stomach.    I would give one star except the people were so nice."}
{"text":"Lake's lounge has a cozy atmosphere. The food was good, we got a Tritip sandwhich philly style and the salmon plate. The prices are low, but we also felt the service was low too. No one there seemed to like their job, which made things a bit awkward. We may come back someday but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great find right in the Lakes area. Much smaller than anticipated, but that didn't affect our visit. The place is physically split in half; one side is the bar, the other is the dining room. For the happy hour specials, you'll need to be in the dining room.  We went on a Saturday around 6 and it was pretty busy in the dining room. The bar not so much.  Service was prompt and friendly, food order was taken quickly and food delivered on point.  Wife had the prime rib - very good, plenty of food for 14.99! I had the prime rib dip sandwich, tasty as well. Definitely will be back, especially for breakfast."}
{"text":"Always have good experiences here but wow today. Stopped by to play a little a to get something to eat after a hair cut and wait couple minutes just to get a drink, bartender to busy socializing with another co worker and patron. Then everyone trying to get her attention to order it was just ignored. I even set the menu upright to signal I was ready to order. 20 minutes.... I finally decided to cash out and take my self some where else that would like my money. It was when she was handing me my money when I was asked if I decided if I knew what I wanted to eat. Ha I knew when I laid the damn menu down.  I refer a lot of people there and this trip would have been embarrassing if I took someone with me."}
{"text":"Inexpensive food that is worth your money! The food is good, service is good; therefore, my tummy is always satisfied whenever I'm here. The portions are enough to fill you up and maybe more."}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite neighborhood place! We try to go at least twice a month!  The breakfast is amazing  and super cheap!!  And the chicken parm sandwich is a great dinner!!  The service is a little slow but the food makes up for it!  Even though its a little slow the staff is always very friendly!  The outside looks like a dive but inside is so elegant and cozy feeling!"}
{"text":"Living in the Lakes for 10 years, I never took advantage of how close it was from home and how cozy and delicious this place truly is. I have since moved to green valley and still manage to drive 30 miles just for their amazing food and a sence of home, the staff is so friendly and hard working, the food is great and well priced, and they've managed to separate their bar and restaurant with a smoke free wall dividing the 2 sides. weather your in the mood for a beer and some bar food, wine and a steak, breakfast after church on a sunday or just some really good food and awesome service, the Lakes lounge is the place to go! My Favorite restaurant in all of Las vegas!"}
{"text":"The reason it is so dark is to hide the filth... Yuck!  Not impressed in the least... Staff are slow... Surprised the Lakes would have such a hole in their community.  Greasy spoon."}
{"text":"We really enjoy coming to this restaurant. It's small, inexpensive, and tasty. Today I had the blueberry pancakes. Three large pancakes chock full of blueberries served with whipped butter and syrup for $5.49. My guy got the steak and eggs special for $6.99. It comes with a good sized steak cooked to order, two eggs, toast and breakfast potatoes. I had a soda as well and the total bill was under $16. We walked away with stuffed bellies and money left in our wallets."}
{"text":"Lakes Lounge is a great place to have a meal. My husband and I read a review about our neighborhood eatery 4 years ago and have been fans ever since. We work hard and like to treat ourselves to a great meal and this place competes easily with your top establishments.  The food is exceptional along with the great customer service. We love all the people who work there but watch out for Brandon...he does not make you feel welcome or gives the excellent customer service as the other employees. You will absolutely agree when I say that Lakes Lounge is a fabulous place to dine, but just avoid Brandon. He doesn't do this place justice by being an employee there and probably should re-evaluated.  Maybe the owners should have a secret shopper eat there to understand what I'm talking about. If it were not for the other staff there I would take our business elsewhere. Don't let one BAD APPLE...well you know the rest"}
{"text":"Very, very good food at very reasonable prices.  Tucked away just slightly off the beaten path, it's a cool little spot that it seems like a lot of people that live right near it love it.  possibly not a lot of people around the valley though.  I got the fish and chips, it was amazing.  My friend got the steak sandwich special, she said it was also very good.  The service was polite and quick, but not at all rushed.  Overall great experience.   I should add there is also a whole bar section that I did not go to, but the specials looked good and it seemed pretty nice as well."}
{"text":"For sure this is a locals place of people in the surrounding area.   Quick review as there isnt much to it. Food is decent, cheap, and large portions. Service was quick and friendly. Eat here again? maybe if im in the area and need a quick bite, but not making a special trip for it. I had the fish tacos which were a 6.5/10 and the sweet potato tots which were also a 6/10. If you live in a 1-2 mile radius, for sure its a go to place to grab a bite on the quick/cheap."}
{"text":"The food here was just average. We ordered the fried chicken, fish tacos, prime dip Philly style and fried calamari. It wasn't bad, but just not that great; again just average.  The fried chicken batter wasn't very good and was too oily and the meat was a bit dry, especially the white meat. The coleslaw side was pretty good but the portion way too small for 4 pieces of chicken.   The prime dip was pretty good but the meat portion was neither big nor small; sort of on the unsatisfying side though. The fries it came with were the giant cut, out of a plastic bag variety.  The fish tacos were nicely presented but bland as sliced bread. The side of salsa it came with was paltry and barely enough for one taco.  The calamari was good but maybe because it was the appetizer and we were all hungry, and the portion seemed fair. The marinara was typical but the pesto sauce was salty.    For $40 including the tip, you can't complain too much about the price. But, our server was lukewarm, the ambiance funeral home quiet, and at the hour we went, 6pm, it was mostly elderly folks.   There's a lot out there where 40 bucks can buy 3 people a very tasty meal in a lively if not interesting setting. At Lakes Lounge, the most interesting thing were the Sunday night football games on the multiple flat-screens and the locals hanging out at the bar playing video poker.  Unless you like a serving of suburban Vegas boredom cum mild depression with your average American meal, you can skip this place."}
{"text":"I love this place- great food - good service! It's not a very big restaurant... However, I have been here twice and never had to wait.  I recommend the sweet potato tots! Never had anything like them before! Yummy!"}
{"text":"The place suits its name.   Restaurant on one side classic NV video poker bar on the other.  The menu is simple and has all the crowd favorites like burgers, a ruben, fish n chips, steak and eggs.  I got the steak and eggs and it was cooked to my order and came out piping hot, servers were nice but did not hover."}
{"text":"Best food in the west side of vegad French onion soup garlic bread Cezar salad and house wine Awsome Great food fast and affordable"}
{"text":"Me and my buddy came in here again on Wednesday, July, 20th, 2016 around 4 or 5 pm. I still will say the customer service is great, we were acknowledged quickly entering and asked what we wanted to drink and if we wanted menu's.        There were maybe 10 people or a little less in total, but the beers tasted fine, food was excellent, and the bartender was very polite and didn't mind keeping a conversation. For a small bar and grill to me was awesome, because it offers anyone to either sit at the bar or tables in another room away from the smoke.        Overall I will keep coming back here with my friends and family."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my friend from out. Of town and we had a fabulous meal again. Tonight. I go here often. I so enjoy it plus they were waiting for tables. One of the best places in Vegas. Never have had a bad meal ever."}
{"text":"Love their food!, Gaming is OK. Some of the staff is great but a few are moody enough where I know which days to not go there and avoid a few bartenders that are just not pleasant. The building is old with a poor ventilation system so it can get real smoky if a lot of people are smoking."}
{"text":"Although breakfast stops at 2PM, I couldn't be too upset because well... We waited until 2:30 to eventually get somewhere for breakfast. That's totally on us. My girlfriend was a bit upset, but I had to remind her... Seriously... We didn't get somewhere for BREAKFAST by past lunch time haha  I've been wanting to try this place for awhile since we just moved into the very near neighborhood, and it has some pretty good reviews. It being near the lakes, being called a lounge, and open 24 hours... I imagined some sort of diner type place. Well, I was mistaken.   First of all, on the outside, it's nothing special to look it. Honestly if I wasn't navigating there from Yelp, I might have just not seen it. My girlfriend and I were a little hesitant, but I figured hey, it's got good reviews and I've never let a dive type place stop me from enjoying food! (See: The Waffle House).  We swing the door open to the dining side of the place, and wow! Much different than imagined. As noted by others, very dark, but it was nice. You can see the pictures, nice stone walls, all the furniture looked new, just an overall cozy nice atmosphere. I would have preferred a window, but seeing as how there was a glass wall between the bar and gambling area, I'm sure they were looking to keep the whole place dark at all times.   We grabbed the menu, swam in some self pity about the breakfast situation, and then ordered some lunch. I got the lakes cordon bleu, and man, was that sandwich good. It was under 8 bucks, and came with plenty of sweet potato tots (which were really sweet potato-y!)  I mean, drenching it in buffalo wing sauce was just a beautiful touch, and the frying on the chicken was perfect. Seriously, I'm salivating right now imagining having it again. It was just that well done.   We also got some coffee that was pretty good too.   One big reason we will be back, the value of this place is nuts! I saw fettuccine Alfredo on the menu, and read 10.99. I was thinking wow that's incredibly cheap.... Then saw that was for added chicken! The normal one is 7.99! Definitely going here for a super affordable dinner in the very near future."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is great. Service is great. And the Cheeseburger soup is awesome"}
{"text":"I feel like I'm in the elevated classy  brother of the Village Pub. Crazy daily specials. A fun little plaza shop location. Bar on the right, restaurant on the left door. 5 stars for the quality, quantity and price for plates.  Had the outrageous prime rib that was the size of my face. Thick and juicy cut with a peppery crust. It came with a soup, but opted for the generic fresh iceberg lettuce, 2 slices cukes and 2 cherry tomatoes with croutons.  Selection of Ellis Island brews. Like the Hefe.  Salmon plate was enjoyable even prepared \"plain\". Juicy. Came with rice pilaf and mixed veggies.  Comfortable atmosphere. Good parking and great service. Sports channel on the tv's."}
{"text":"Typical old Vegas café style food complete with dim lighting, affordable prices and generous servings! Service is quick and friendly; we ordered the Steak & Eggs special and Shrimp Scampi. I ordered the steak medium-rare and I got medium-well. The Shrimp Scampi was delicious, I only lament the excess sauce that made it more like a soup. I would return to try other items on the menu, but not anytime soon..."}
{"text":"My son and I were on the hunt for a new, delicious, lunch spot, so the Yelp app lead us here. \"The Lakes\" is a beautiful community, so we were definitely wanting to check out a restaurant surrounding the lake. We landed on \"Lakes Lounge\".  The outside of the restaurant is \"vintage\", if you will, like something you would see outside a boat yard in Santa Monica. It was a nice change of scenery, compared to everything else in Vegas.   We walked in and grabbed a comfy booth. Our server was Margaret, and she was very nice. I asked for her opinion on some items, and I narrowed it down to their \"Famous Chicken Pot Pie\"(refer to pic). I added a \"House Salad\"(refer to pic), for $1.99, which was delicious. When the pot pie came out, it looked incredible! It was gigantic, and had a beautiful, buttery, layer of crust on top that makes your mouth water, just wondering what treasure you'll discover inside. MmmMm, is what I was thinking, while patting myself on the back for the good choice. As soon as I put my spoon to the crust, it was like a symphony! Beautiful sounds of perfectly baked, fluffy crust, flaking so effortlessly apart, but this is where the symphony had a few miss notes, and maybe a sneeze or two from the conductor. The pot pie looked as though is was made with an over abundance of heavy cream, which was odd to see.  From the first bite the pot pie was so overpoweringly creamy, I was literally hoping it was a joke.. like, that is what they do here. They give you a terrible first bite and then the food is incredible. This was not the case, unfortunately. I couldn't eat more than 10 bites(refer to pic). It was very disappointing, because I'm a hugh lover of pot pie's.  After not eating much, Margaret brought over some boxes for my sons food and she took mine away, saying, sorry she wished I had enjoy it more. I didn't ask for it to be removed from the bill, but she was awesome enough to give that kind of guest service, where she knew it was needed. Thank you Margaret, I appreciate it. They definitely have integrity, and i will always try a place again when they show that. 3 stars for now. I will definitely be back for some different items."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. Daniella was our bartender last night, myself and two friends had only bottles of water and one shot. We minded our business and when we laughed \"too loud\" she came over and told us to \"tone it down a few notches\" because we were bothering her gamers. At first we thought she was joking but no, she clarified that we were bothering people and had to keep it down. Uh, what? Never once have I been told that laughing in a bar wasn't allowed. She seemed as if we were a huge inconvenience just being there minding our business. Clearly three waters and pouring one shot was just too much for her to handle. Sorry for making you do your job while you're at work, Daniella, don't worry we will never go there again. Word of mouth is powerful and when another bartender is treated that way, you can guarantee that they won't recommend Lakes Lounge to anyone. Avoid this place at all costs if you have fun friends and like to laugh because according to Daniella \"this isn't that kind of place\""}
{"text":"Another day, another visit to Lakes Lounge, and another great experience.  This time our waiter wasn't funny, the way our waitress was last time, but he was just fine - attentive and efficient.    Despite the 112 degree temps, we both decided to have soup.  The home-made beef barley was chock-full of tender beef and vegetables, and filled me up before the main course arrived.  I ordered the day's special, meat loaf - two large slices - which came with mashed potatoes and fresh sauteed vegetables.  Unfortunately, the veggies were drowning in salt, and the waiter offered to have the kitchen prepare plain steamed ones.  He returned two minutes later with a plate of veggies big enough to feed a small country.  Needless to say, I had the clairvoyance to know what I was going to have for dinner 24 hours later!  Hubby had the Fish and Chips, got 'em with sweet potato tots, and can't wait to go back and order it all over again.  Another successful sojourn to Lakes Lounge!"}
{"text":"Tomato w/Basil soup was yummy!!! The Chicken Fried Chicken was a very impressive piece of fried chicken, fresh, juicy, not over cooked at all.... I highly recommend getting the gravy on the side, it was the least impressive part of the meal. A surprisingly good meal at this little lounge!"}
{"text":"Well first off what a hidden gem this is. We go there at least once a month for steak and eggs. Sue our waitress always waits on us with her pleasant smile and Anthony is always right there to get our coffee and let us know we are welcomed.  The tacos are terrific and the afternoon calamari is the bomb.  We always come back to the family atmosphere and there is a separate bar on the other side. Keep it up"}
{"text":"Always here for the Dinner Specials. Great food at a great price. Anyone that enjoys American food should  try this place out."}
{"text":"Lakes lounge was very relaxed and comfortable for a meal. I really liked the service and the quality of their entrees. I had fish and chips, which seemed to be one of the hot items on the menu. It didn't disappoint, even their fries are delicious, seasoned to perfection!  Also, the fact that it's open 24 hours is fantastic. You want to grab a dinner and the go home and induce yourself into a food coma."}
{"text":"We love this bar! My guy and I decided to give it a try since it was close to home. Stephanie, Jennifer and Daniella are the best! The food is amazing but we honestly come back just for them. I would give this bar 10 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Best service and food. We go here as often as possible. Mark is great at his job. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in 4+ years, but was pleasantly surprised.  It was nicely renovated, which it really needed, and they still have the best deal in town with their steak sandwich.  Service was a little slow, but the bartender was obviously not a \"professional\".  Id definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came for dinner with my husband and He ordered French onion soup & it was so salty had to send it back.  The nice waitress replaced it with chicken noodle soup instead and that was salty too but ok to eat if you're hungry. I ordered the chicken Francese and that was horrible. Rice was mushy and some parts hard then the green beans were tasteless. The chicken was hard in some sections and the flavor was bland. I felt bad but sent it back. Clearly I'm not coming here again. My husband had the fish tacos and those were ok, just ok. We only decided to try this place bc it had 4 stars on yelp. Yes 4 stars! My opinion fast food taste better than this. The service was nice and pleasant."}
{"text":"Wow, who would have thought this local bar/restaurant would be a good find? Quick note though; this restaurant offers no view of the lake. Actually there are no windows inside.    Came here with a business associate. Made a quick turn from Charleston and you're practically there.   There are two doors; one to the smoking allowed bar and one to the dining room.  The dining room probably seats less than 70 people so it's definitely quaint.   The menu seems pretty extensive. They even have dinner specials. I had the apple  pecan salad with the grilled chicken. It was surprisingly delicious! They give you plenty of pecans; the apple slices were fresh. I had paid a lot more for similar salad and the apples were pre-cut, so those was a pleasant surprise! There amount of dressing was just right.    The salad also came with some toasted garlic bread stick and they were also very good.   The service was exceptional. Very attentive and our glasses were never empty.   You definitely get good value for the price you pay here! Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"This a little whole in the wall. I was debating the 5 star with this place because its not like its the taj mahal....however the food is solid and the prices are very fair. They are also open 24/7. I like the convenience and the close proximity to my house. so far i havent gotten a bad meal...its also a nice choice from whatever is open at 2 am....in fact i dont think there is much else open at that time"}
{"text":"A tiny place out in Summerlin, but very good.  The service was outstanding and the prices were unbelievable!  Where can you get a prime rib special with salad/soup and potatoes & veggies for less than $16?  Shrimp cocktail with 8 shrimp for less than $9?  Amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden treasure. Their chicken pot pie is amazing, perfect crust,creamy and lots of chicken. Tons of peas too but it so good."}
{"text":"We enjoy going to the Lakes - the food is great, reasonably priced, & we often wish we had anything even vaguely close to this in Mountains Edge.  The only thing iffy there is the service.  Tonight we had one of those waitresses who checked back when we were almost done eating  & brought the check before asking if we would like anything else.  Her lackadaisical service left a bitter taste on an otherwise enjoyable evening.  Lakes Lounge, you really need to improve your service.  Restaurants in general, Mountains Edge is dying for some good options!"}
{"text":"AWESOME prices on food and they brew their own beer!! Usually an older crowd (from my experience, anyway). They have a pretty big menu and a different special every day (call to find out what it is and GET THERE EARLY - they run out of it!). If you're a craft beer junkie, it's a reasonable place to have something other than a Bud Light."}
{"text":"The title of this place is actually diner & lounge and it is actually divided into those two sections. One side is a restaurant where you can sit down in booths and the other side is a bar with video machines ! Food was delicious"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and Sue and Robin give excellent service Chicken tenders are great...everything is made to order!"}
{"text":"Warm and inviting, great food, and most importantly a great spot to knock a few back.  We walked in during Monday Night Football and the place was packed!  We elected to sit at the bar and grab a few drinks before getting some food.  The bartender was very cordial and willing to answer any questions that we had.  Eventually we ordered a Chicken Caesar wrap with sweet potato tots, and some wings.  The food was absolutely fantastic, and the entertainment value from the patrons around us was great.  All in all this place is friendly, with a great atmosphere and delicious menu items.  I would have to say that we'll be back very, very soon.  Thanks so much for a great time!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Great atmosphere.  Smokeless cozy. Home cooked food.  I'm Reluctant to let you know of one of Vegas best kept secret open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Off the beaten path, would have never found this place had it not been for my best friend who is a local.  Little bit of a wait, but totally worth it.  Don't let the location fool you, this is a hidden gem.  I have been different times of the night, and quality of the food is always consistent.  Never any \"late-night leftover\" taste.  If you go at 5pm or 5am you'll be pleased with the service and the food.  BEST pot pie I have ever had!!  EVER!!! Friendly staff. All the food was great, second favorite was the French Dip...Can't say enough good things about this place"}
{"text":"Chicken Parm a+ French onion soup a+ chef salad a+ The chicken pot pie in the shepherds pie is also an A+ the fried chicken wasn't that great I wouldn't recommend that at all but the burgers chicken Parmesan French onion soup chef salad in the pot pies are a hit very good place and plus I live right around the corner"}
{"text":"A hidden gem. Small restaurant, big flavor. I love the chicken tacos! The prices are great, the food tasty, the staff wonderful. (Yeah, Robin!)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have become regulars and always get the fish tacos! We love this place!  Best in town! And great prices. The servers are all friendly. Ask about the specials too!"}
{"text":"Secret gem hidden in a residential neighborhood. Interior is clean and inviting. Seating is pretty limited so expect to wait if you arrive during peak hours. Great Steak & Eggs or Steak sandwhich for $5.99, but it doesn't taste like it was $5.99. Service is always tops and you know a place is good when servers know customers by name. My parents love this place so much they sometimes go 5 plus times a week. Nothing on the menu is breathtaking just your normal family restaurant food. Great prices, fantastic specials, and consistently good services. In a town like Vegas you can't beat that."}
{"text":"I live on the lake and decided to stop by for lunch. It was very cool how I could dock my boat and walk up right to it. The good was good and it was a good atmosphere. A great place to stop by for lunch."}
{"text":"I went  here on Thursday at lunchtime- not busy at all. Upon entering you seat yourself. We are immediately greeted by some servers who were very hospitable. The atmosphere of the restaurant is cool and dark.  My table the calamari, grilled fish tacos, fried shrimp in a basket, and the brownie ice cream. I am in love with this fish tacos, the position is huge and can't go wrong being $5.99 with a fresh coleslaw. Their shrimp was delicious and fries are seasoned amazingly. The calamari tasted so delicious and fresh, and was accompanied by some delicious sauces. The brownie with ice cream was a party! We were so full from our food already and that brownie feeds well over two people.  Come here with an empty stomach and friends and you won't break the bank! They have many specials throughout the week and I will be coming back here to try them!"}
{"text":"So I am kind of bias because I have been eating here for ten plus years, but if you want good to above average food at reasonable prices without the scuminess that comes with practically ever pub in town this is the place.  I love that it is tucked away in the Lakes like some secret, because it is!  The average person would pass by a hundred times and never know it was there.  My dad took me here one day randomly as he had been eating there for many years with his friends after golf, and it is now the place I take anyone from out of town or new friends.     My favorite meal is probably a common one, the steak sandwich."}
{"text":"Came in late last week on a Wendsday with a few of my friends after raving about the food and prices there were only 3 people inside the bar area and the bartender quickly stopped us and said that he couldn't serve us don't wanna push the racist agenda but it sure felt like it. I'm never going to spend my money here again that was emabarassing!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, not only for drinking but the food is great for a great price. Their Cajun steak fries are why I make sure to go here every once in a while."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying we ate in the restaurant first and the food and service were terrific. The restaurant was getting busy and rather than take up a table we moved over to the bar so people could eat. The bar was full but some nice guys moved over so we could have three seats together.   We order our drinks.  The machines have laminated notes on the screen saying that the machines are for gamblers and if not gambling will be asked to move.  No problem...  I know how to read and take note. Common knowledge I would think to all who go to local bars.  We order another drink from the bartender. I called after I left and asked her name and was told Stephanie. Young girl with long medium brown hair working on a Friday night. She had an attitude and only continued to get worse as the night progressed. She proceeds to tell us the the two games we are sitting at are one of kind machines and that if someone wants to use them we need to move. She than puts the laminated note back on the machine.  Rude... my friend had been gambling but apparently she either didn't see or wanted to continue being nasty.  One of my friends boyfriend arrives and she leaves.  Not going to deal with nasty she says. As my other friend begins to gamble on another machine the now try to be nice bartender asks her if she wants a drink. Also mentions it is for two drinks. Uhh ya... she's gambling drinks should be comped. Not to mention the bar was half full by this time. Treat your customers nice maybe people will stay. So turned off by her attitude we didn't even finish our free drinks. Also we had ordered a beer while we were in the dining room.  Tasted off.  Very sour.  When we told the bartender she said we just didn't know wheat beers.  So funny.  My girlfriend is beer connoisseur and would never send a beer back just because...  I thought local bars were supposed to have friendly help?"}
{"text":"Is this a dive bar? I don't know, maybe!  What's really nice about this tasty little spot tucked in the Lakes is that the restaurant is nicely separated from the bar.  Why is this a HUGE plus? Well if you don't want to smell like an ash tray when you leave you will like this restaurant/bar!  They have video poker machines at the bar portion and really friendly bartenders.  They pour great drinks that taste good.  They don't over pour on the booze so your dink actually is enjoyable.  Nothing I hate more than when a bartender is trying to be all nice and he/she pours so much alcohol in your glass you can't enjoy it with out that \"bitter beer face\" or in my case, bitter vodka face!  We ordered some food and well...the waitress, doing her job I am sure would not make any changes to the menu.  Ok I can me a pain and ask for weird crap but really? You offer chips and salsa but can't make nachos? I was told I would have to pay for everything individually.  Ugh, really!?  Well I ordered the chips and salsa and a small bowl of chili with cheese.  I dumped it on those crispy chips and poof! I had nachos.  Stupid rule if you ask me but I am sure there must be some brilliant reason as to why they can't make the nachos for me in their KITCHEN!    My meal was good.  We also ordered a chef salad. It tasted as though it had been previously prepared and sat in the fridge in advance.  It was so cold (weird but if your a salad eater you will understand).  It had the flavor of a freezer...meh!  All in all I like this place and we will be back! It is close to home after all."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat! Food fantastic, prices low. Service is what you would like it to be, efficient, caring that you have anything you may need. The manager is top notch Paul is the man who keeps it in good form. Have a treat eat at this little neat place."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pub. The place is way nicer inside than it appears outside. The drinks were spot on and the food was yummy, even at 4AM. The staff was friendly and provided great service."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much as I work graves and many small gaming bars have steak and egg specials - usually kinda gross steaks, but here for I think $6.99, I got an 8oz NY Strip steak cooked to the right temp, seasoned well, and not a crappy cut of meat like most S&E \"specials\", tender & overall yummy! It also came with eggs (also cooked to perfection), fried breakfast potatoes, and choice of toast! My friend got a build your own omlet and was very pleased as well! Thumbs up! Will definitely return again soon!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. NO smoke as the areas are divided by glass. Prices were surprisingly low so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm appalled at the way my husband and I were treated this afternoon at this establishment. Seat yourself, they tell you. We moved booths the first  time since the table was unsteady and we sunk into the seat. Next spot was tight as we found a friend was joining us and we needed a bigger area. Moved again, only to have the hostess with black glasses and black hair scold us! She literally said, \"Are you finally settled?\" Insert her eye roll....  We were about to laugh with her until she came out with, \"I seriously can't have you moving around our restaurant anymore.\" Ummm ok, I tell her we're not being assholes, we've moved our stuff, made no previous mess. Check please.... note to management.. you've lost good lunch customers over the ignorance and social awkwardness of your not-so hospitable hostess. I've never been treated like this and we're industry lifers. We paid our tab, before we could order more with the pleasant Angelica. (You deserved that tip, thank you again!) Next we gave a homeless person our meal. At least we found one positive at this property."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good chicken fried steak on the west side of town and a website recommended the Lakes Lounge.  I went there and was pleasantly surprised.  The wait staff was super nice. Everything was nice and clean (no smoke smell) The service was prompt, and the entire meal was very good.  Many things on the menu looked good, so I cannot wait to go back and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Who said you can't screw up a breakfast?  I mean, what can go wrong with toast & potatoes & eggs & a hunk of meat?  Lakes Lounge did with ours, twice in a row.    I won't bring up the 2 weeks ago breakfast, but this past Sunday it went like this.  We were among the 1st to arrive just before 9:00 ( they open at 7:00) & soon there were plenty of servers milling around.  I'm not sure if the chef showed up before 9:30, but our orders were among the 1st to hit the kitchen, & then we waited... and waited more.   Keep in mind there are no Egg Beaters and only deep-fried potatoes.  And when you add onions & green peppers to the \"fried\", the oil over-rides the taste of those veggies I normally love on potatoes.   Anyway, our toast came 10. mins. after our egg plates & it was only half buttered (oh, oiled) & almost burnt.  The potatoes were cold so we placed another order (it came soon enough).  My egg whites were fine & my partner's eggs & steak were also.  The Lakes Lounge is a neighborhood \"community\" experience which we like, & their menu is terrific, as well as inexpensive.  Each day of the week there's a special of roast beef, Thanksgiving dinner, or 5 other choices under $9.  We think it's the best fish fry in town & their other specials like blackened fish tacos, are varied & interesting.  An added bonus is their daily happy hour on drinks.  l am hoping they'll get their act  together on serving breakfast because right now I hesitate to repeat the experience.  And it'd be great if Egg Beaters & hash browns were added to this early morning fare."}
{"text":"My friend and I headed over to our favorite neighborhood place and decided to splurge on the Prime Rib special last Friday. Wow! What a delicious piece of meat. Tender, juicy and tasty. Huge piece. Had to take some home. Green beans cooked perfectly. Mashed potatoes were a little gummy but tasted good. The clam chowder that came with it was the best I ever had. Chunks of real potatoes and loaded with clams.  I wish I knew how to add pics so I can show the generous portions. We each spent $20 bucks including tip. Well worth it.  Funny, when roaming around in the market looking for dinner and I see how expensive prepared dinners are my thoughts turn to this nice, cozy place and how much more you receive for the same price."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Fantastic customer service and the food is even better.  The omelets are awesome!  Would definitely recommend to anyone.  Will come again!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for the last 10 years and it is the best little hidden gem. Doesn't matter if you come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner the food is amazing! We absolutely love coming here. (And go about once to twice a week). Prices are so affordable and what's great is they serve breakfast up until 2pm. They have a great steak and egg special for $6! As well as for lunch time have a steak sandwich special for the same price. There is so much food that you can definitely share.    If you are looking for great food at a great price def have to try the lakes lounge. They also have a separate section that's a bar and has slot machines to play. Happy hour also has great prices. You won't be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"updating the review to three stars. Service is hit-or-miss sometimes it's fast and easy other times it's not so good. Food is also similar sometimes I go in its good other times I go in not so good."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it's surprisingly nice inside.  Very relaxing atmosphere with dim lighting.  Great service, delicious food, and great prices.  We had a chicken pasta dish with sun-dried tomatoes, portabello mushrooms, and a creamy garlic sauce that was absolutely delicious (and huge).  The chicken was perfectly grilled, and very juicy.  It came with some garlic bread, and a salad (or soup) for $10.99.  The fish and chips we had were some of the best I've tried in town.  I got a steak sandwich to go for my boyfriend, and that was delicious as well (and only $6!).  Unfortunately, the potato salad it came with was really unappealing.  We'll just stick to the fries next time. I can't wait to come back just to hang out at the bar. They have Miller Lite, and 5 Ellis Island Brewery beers on tap.  The draft beers are only $2 during happy hour (3-7pm every day)."}
{"text":"Lakes has been our go to for years. They are a smaller restaurant, and the wait can be brutal at times, but the food and service are worth it. Fish & chips, nightly specials, breakfast burrito & of course steak & eggs are all amazing! We've tried almost everything on the menu. Love this little spot!  April 2016 Update - sadly, Lakes has decided to change their breakfast potatoes. They are a greasy mess of potato bits fried with onions and green peppers. Not edible. Super saddening because we used to love this place."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place to grab a bite with the Family. Gaming bar is separated from the dining side. TVs everywhere for your viewing pleasure.  All food ordered today was good. Chicken strips were excellent."}
{"text":"From the look of it, this place doesn't look all that great. On the outside, it looks almost shady and you're kind of confused for a moment. You step inside and there's a sign that tells you to seat yourself. The restaurant is split in the middle with a glass wall. One side is the bar and the other side is for dining. Honestly I believe it looks tacky as hell.   Everything was really, really cheap. My party of three totalled only $23!! I ordered fettuccine Alfredo with the creamy wild rice chicken soup. The soup and alfredo was sooooooo good. I was really surprised. The food here was surprisingly good. Don't let appearances fool you.   Service was average. I do love how fast they were and how fast our food came out. We barely even waited unlike other places."}
{"text":"Prices are great! For appetizer we got chips and salsa. Chips were hot and crispy and the salsa was delicious.  For entree I got a 8 oz steak and eggs (6.99) and my partner got a steak sandwich (too large to finish) and was also 6.99. Steak was perfectly cooked to medium-rare and I love their potatoes. And my total came out to be $18.  I deducted a star because of how small the place was and there was a line for those awaiting for seats. Service was great but it took awhile for them to get to our table in terms of taking our order and getting the bill. Overall, me and my friend had a great time and wouldn't mind going back!"}
{"text":"I would do no stars if I could, but I can't. This place is hidden away in a dark corner. We walked in the dining room got weird looks from the server that was sitting with some guess, then another server asked how many? No greeting then the third server waived us down and asked \"are u sure this seat will be okay?\". I responded with I've never been there so any seat is fine. We sat at a wet table with dirty seats. So then the server asked me what I would like to drink, when I responded with coke she said \"oh yeah our soda machine isn't working\". Then my boyfriend asked \"you have NO soda?\", she said no just water and tea. That's when I got up and said its a deal breaker to have nothing other than water and tea. I will not be going back there."}
{"text":"I had dined here once before but brought my g/f for her first experience last night.  Parking lot was fairly full and once we opened the door at 7:20pm the place was full.  It seems the glass partition to the bar side was new but the restaurant side was full with exception to a booth that opened up just in time for us.  Great looking menu and she opted for the pot pie and I had the Thursday special which was a garlic chicken ensemble.  I tried a little bit of the pot pie which was good and my chicken platter was delicious.  We both had salads and the total bill came to $20.  Amazing.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Great Bar and restaurant,  new bar tops and USB ports .Great atmosphere and not smoky at all with great service and great food."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood hideaway.  Ample portions.  Soups are always good.  Great comfort food. Service is fast and friendly.  The pot pie is so rich and creamy.  Specials every night, most under $10.  Meatloaf, chicken, or turkey and stuffing are tasty!"}
{"text":"Incredible! Such a quiet nice atmosphere. All the food prices are so cheap so you can get a bit of everything but it all tastes amazing. Definitely get their ranch. The peanut butter pie is what dreams are made of and the service was top notch!"}
{"text":"Good food and generous portions for a low price! Daily specials. Two of us had pot roast and mashed potatoes/gravy with veggies and soup of salad.+ 2 iced teas for $19 and change. Great deal! Very small- shares a wall with the bar area., but smelled no smoke! What a relief! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I thought I had found a real gem until I discovered that most of my friends already were frequent patrons at The Lakes Lounge Restaurant. The restaurant and gaming bar have separate entrances and air handling systems so there is no smoke at all in the restaurant area. The steak sandwich at $7 is a steal. It's a decent steak on a good crusty roll accompanied by either fries, coleslaw or onion rings. My friends swear by the fish and chips stating that the tartar sauce is the best they've ever had. I saw the French onion soup last night and know my wife would love it as she's a fan of that soup. The service has always been friendly and attentive. For a restaurant at a gaming bar I don't see how you could do better."}
{"text":"This used to be the best bar in Vegas to go to. They have the best food the place was a dump and everybody knew your name.  I used to talk to Dana Plato sitting there playing nickels on the video poker machine.  Overtime they upgraded it they made it nicer and the specials that they used to have  all went away.  It was what it was but  they had the best chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich ever and yesterday when I went I found out they took it off the menu.  Had a disappointing burger and crappy service really don't see a reason to go back there anymore it's no different then a PT's trying to be fancy.  What a shame.  I hate seeing the old places leave Vegas."}
{"text":"The in-laws discovered this place a few years ago. Back then, it really was a \"hidden gem.\" Although the entire plaza has always looked old and ghetto. The food wasn't outstanding, but it was good enough and you had no reason to complain about the prices. Sadly over the years and more recently, I feel like the quality of their food has gone downhill.  I have ordered a variety of food here, but nothing really stands out. The fried shrimp has never let me down. But then again, fried shrimp pretty much tastes the same everywhere. I do like the sweet potato tots and they do give you a generous portion of them. The clam chowder that I had once was tasty and my husband said that the fish and chips was good here. Some of the things I didn't like was the chicken parmesan, which was very bland and the grilled wild salmon. The salmon was alright, but the rice pilaf was horrible and the mixed veggies were dry.   Service is usually friendly and attentive, although there were a few times that we waited long to be seated and to order. In my experience, both the service and food are bad on Friday nights. They have a bar side which is open 24 hours, and the dining room side which is open daily from 7am to 9pm.   So the Lakes Lounge is definitely affordable and gives you big portions, but they need to work on the quality and taste of their food. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. Honestly, you will be better off going to Denny's and ordering from their $2, $4, $6, $8 value menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, totally separated from smoking part of the bar, friendly service, excellent food and super prices.  I had the French Onion and it was very good.  I also went back the next day for their prime rib special and it was very good and the Ceasar salad that came with it was incredible."}
