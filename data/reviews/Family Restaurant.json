{"text":"Fantastic. One of the best falafel sandwiches I have ever had. Really great picked vegetables and fresh ingredients. The owner was super friendly. He noticed I was a vegetarian (when I declined to try my friend's bacon pizza) and brought me out some lentil soup he had just made to try. It was delicious!   I HIGHLY recommend. I also noticed that it's BYOB; I have to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"My goodness, what an outstanding meal we had! This place is truly a diamond find. Service was great, not overbearing at all. Decor is comforting and clean. But the food, omg. I haven't had a meal that divine in AGES. My body and soul are still singing it's praises. We had grapes leaves and the Mezza platter as appetizers. The grape leaves didn't taste exclusively like lemon, as I've often encountered, but they're served with lemon slices so you can add to fit your taste. The baba on the platter was robust and smokey. The hummus was probably the best I've ever had, so fresh! The pickled veggies were properly tart and crunchy. We also order the kabobs and gyro kabobs. The salad that came with our meals were enormous, practically a meal onto themselves. The dressing was perfect! The kabob was out of this world, spiced so keenly as to really pack a punch with flavor, but not hide the flavor of the lamb. That's tricky! The same of the gyro meat, which can often be dry in my experience, but it was moist and paired especially well with the rice. I think I tasted a hint of nutmeg in the rice. It was amazing. I don't doubt that everything on the menu is just as exceptional, I guess I'll have to keep going back and try everything, haha.   Really, truly can't recommend this establishment enough. If you like this cuisine, you owe yourself the pleasure of a trip here!"}
{"text":"This is my family's favorite place for take out and delivery! Owner/chef Sam can do no wrong! Big, giant DELICIOUS gyros, amazing pizza and awesome service have made this our number one spot.   My only complaint is the hummus. It may be authentic but I feel that it needs a little spice or salt.   Support this great restaurant in Carrick! I'm constantly afraid that they'll disappear!  EDITED: FAMILY RESTAURANT JUST WENT FROM FOUR STARS TO FIVE! I ordered the falafel sandwich and it is the best I've ever had. I have a new favorite. Holy cow... I want another one right now!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  I had their food at at a catered event and it was great.  Everyone raved about it.  so I used them for a family party and was even better,  We got grape leaves chicken shawarma sandwiches gyros spanikopita  etc.  They were great.  The owners  checked in with us to make sure all was good and were more than hospitable and reasonably priced.  Family Restaurant is now our family favorite restaurant.  When friends and family come to Pittsburgh from out of town this is where they ask to go."}
{"text":"I heard about family restaurant from pittsburgh vegans, and that they have some vegan items. We live a few blocks from it, so I was super excited . The place is so clean which is not common for carrick/Brentwood restaurants. And the man at the counter was so friendly and fast! We got takeout, I got falafel and fries and an order of hummus and pita. So delicious! The falafel was so fresh and had the most delicious crispy crust on it. The sandwich comes with lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and turnips and comes with tahini on it. The hummus is delicious!!! Smooth and tangy! My husband got a gyro, he wasn't super into the gyro sauce, but otherwise was satisfied. The fries were a little soft but didn't stop us from eating them. We'll definitely go again. I hear they are adding more vegan dishes soon, which makes me excited to go back and try other things. Totally worth a try, and a go back!"}
{"text":"Family Restaurant is by far the best Mediterranean restaurant in the Pittsburgh area. Sam is the owner and his wife works along with him. The name Family restaurant truly fits the atmosphere of the restaurant. They are both so nice and welcoming. The restaurant is very clean and like I said the atmosphere is just awesome! My three favorite things off the menu are the Italian calzone, hummus, and rice pilaf. The Italian calzone is the best calzone I've ever had, it's loaded with meat and dripping with Italian dressing and topped with some veggies. The hummus is very fresh and comes with warm pita bread, the rice pilaf doesn't taste like plain rice, it's so good! There isn't one thing I ordered that I didn't like. I guess the calzone gave this away but not only does he serve Mediterranean food, he sells Italian/American food as well.(burgers, fries, pizza, hoagies, salads, etc.) Everyone should support this local business, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I was in search of a good Lebanese restaurant and found a few on here. The first one (on Saw Mill Run Blvd.) was no longer in business; and I found this one on Brownsville Rd. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma and for dessert, Baklava. It was my first time eating this type of food and was looking forward to it. I had read the reviews on here and my expectations were high. Let's just say, this restaurant is fantastic! The reviews were on point! I'm definitely coming back and trying other things on the menu. The lady that took our order and served us, was so friendly and really took good care of us. COME AND DINE IN!! You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Great Gyro!!!!!  The baklava was amazing and the service is incredible.  Felt like you were eating at home."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Sam's cooking, no matter what dish I get. So far I've loved the mezza platter, salads, shwarma, gyro and lamb kabobs, baklava and fries. Looking forward to branching out to the fish and pizza. He also makes a mean fresh lemonade, served with a smile by the man himself or delightful wife Zamina! I'll be there tonight! Cheers to The Family Restaurant!"}
{"text":"What a surprise this place is!  Great Middle Eastern food and pizza and wings. I to believe it is a hidden Gem. Spread the word great food great prices."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean food around! Everything is homemade. Excellent tzatziki sauce, and kabobs are out of this world. Will definitely be dining in and getting take out again and again"}
{"text":"Excellent culinary skills and wonderful proprietors nestled here in Carrick. Mix of Mediterranean and pizza shop offerings. Many delicious vegan options but their meat options are really good too!  They are very nice people and the restaurant is immaculately clean. I get take-out and the food I have ordered there is always well-prepared and carefully packaged.  Prices for some dinners are up in the $15-18 range but you get your money's worth with the quality of it."}
{"text":"Family Restaurant is Carrick's hidden jem! I have eaten here numerous times and never got a bad meal.  Sam, the owner, and his wife are very nice and welcoming. The place is very clean and cozy. They treat you like family that has come over their house.  The food here is really good and authentic Middle Eastern food. I love their hummus and pita. I usually get the rice pilaf and mix the hummus in it. Something about their rice pilaf is so good, it is unlike any other rice pilaf that I have had.   The falafel is excellent, crunchy enough to have a bit of a bite but fluffy on the inside and full of flavor! The spinach and meat pies are out of this world! They have so much filling and flavor. You have to try them or you are missing out!  I also have had their gyros and they are good. The meat is very tasty and not super greasy like at other places.  After all you eat, you might be full, but do not leave without getting the baklava. THE BAKLAVA IS TO DIE FOR. It is just scrumptious!!! The sweetness of the butter and honey is perfect, not overwhelming at all. It is perfect, it isn't too runny and it is not too dry. Do not leave without having a bite!!!"}
{"text":"I live close by this place and have heard such good things about it for about a year and finally checked it out! I am so happy I did.   The couple who own the place are so friendly and sweet. Elizabeth D and I came during the week for dinner and were the only ones eating in- the dining area was adorable, clean and comfy.  I ordered the Green beans and tomatoes appetizer- served warm with garlic and spices, it was packeddddd with flavor. One of my favorite dishes ! I also ordered a spinach pie and loved the flaky crust and the tasty spinach and cheese filling- delicious!   For my main course , I had the chicken gyro- the sauce was fresh and delicious  and the chicken was thin cut and super juicy! I loved it.   This place is byob which is amazing! Liz and I were able to split a bottle of wine while we had dinner and it was awesome!   Although I was incredibly full I just had to try some desert. I ordered the baklava. Wow. This was hands down the best baklava I've ever had... Flaky, sugar and honey, nutty... Everything was perfect. I had to order another one to go and one for my mom as well.   I love this place. INCREDIBLE fresh food at very reasonable prices. They have take out too so keep that in Mind if you don't want to eat in."}
{"text":"We started with fantastic humus smothered in olive oil, sprinkled with red pepper, and topped off with fresh parsley.  Then I had a Shawarma pita sandwich that was so good I may never be able to enjoy other foods ever again.  \"Sorry Mom, I know it's Thanksgiving, but have you tried this guys Shawarma?\" My girlfriend had a gyro and she said it was the best she's ever had, and it was the size of her head!  On the way out the owner, who is ridiculously friendly had us sample a chicken shawarma with garlic sauce pita panini that he's experimenting with for his food truck.  Garlicky, spicy chicken with crispy pickles.  Heaven.  We got baclava to go.  If it's as good as I suspect, I may die."}
{"text":"Grape leaves are hot and tender. Salad was crisp expertly dressed. The lamb is brilliant, the pilaf plain but expertly made and piping hot. The schwarma is also expertly made and extremely tasty. Avoid the iced tea. Overall, however, well worth the price."}
{"text":"Hidden gem no doubt. Every thing I have tried (gyro, falafel, platters, rice pilaf, stuffed grape leaves) has been excellent. They may make the best gyro iv ever eaten in fact. This place is one of the only things Carrick has going for it right now and i highly recommend stopping in or taking out!"}
{"text":"This food is great. Please go if you get a chance. The owners are great people that treat you like family. The spinach pies are fantastic as well as the babaganoush."}
{"text":"Hummus. Grape leaves. Gyro. Shawarma. and falafel were all fresh and delicious. Portion size was large. Will come back again."}
{"text":"The gyro is huge! Same with falafel. Hummus is creamy and fantastic, but I wish it came with more pita. The food here is incredible! I've never had their traditionally American foods, I've never felt compelled to, considering how good the middle eastern is. But people tell me it's good. I've never eaten in the restaurant, always got pick-up, and the wait is never too long for that. Great little shop!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much. It is such a great local restaurant. My boyfriend and I are moving away to a different district and I will be very sad that this isn't right down the street from us anymore. It has something for everyone. I am vegan and my boyfriend likes junk food/ bar food. Needless to say they have something for both of us! If we are ever in the area we will surely stop by!"}
{"text":"My sister Vi and I went here tonight (it was 19 out and freezing) and got gyros and baklava. The gyros were so good! They were huge, the biggest gyro I've ever had, and everything was so fresh and delicious. The sweet baklava was a perfect dessert. We will definitely be going back! I plan on getting the shish tawook next time."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I finally stopped at the Family Restaurant after taking in the delicious scents on many a run by and seeing rave reviews on Facebook. This place does not disappoint! We started with the homemade hummus which comes out generously portioned and paired with pita bread, could easily serve 4. The hummus was so good that once our bread was gone I shamelessly grabbed my fork. Next up our Gyro and Chicken Shawarma quickly followed. Both were amazingly delicious. The cucumber sauce was something to write home about, which I did in several texts and Facebook posts after our meal. Sadly we didn't save any room for dessert but I imagine the Baklava would not disappoint. After we finished we had a short conversation with our server who I think might have been the owner. She is a lovely woman and I can't wait to go back to Family Restaurant!"}
{"text":"What a refresher for the neighborhood of Carrick! This restaurant totally makes up for the lack of establishments in the area. I've been wanting to try this for awhile due to the recommendation of Lizzie D. and Meghan B.   My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night. We were the only ones there and it made for a relaxing and intimate evening. There were a few people coming in and out for take-out, though. The atmosphere is sort of all over the place, yet I still appreciated it. There are Asain influences as well as Greek, etc.   On to the food... awesome! The menu is huge and you're bound to find something you'll enjoy. We started with the grape leaves. For some reason, it's so hard to find them with meat inside them - even at Greek fests! Family Restaurant's are meat-filled and amazing! I got a Chicken Shawarma with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles and gyro sauce. It was pretty much everything in a gyro but on a platter. It was so tasty yet simple. The sauce and seasoning they used is perfect and the portions were huge. My BF got a regular gyro. I have never seen a gyro this big in my life. It was huge! He enjoyed it and had to take most of it home.   My only complaint is pricing. They're a little steep, however considering how big their portions are it's understandable. One perk I have to add is it's BYOB! Always an ultimate win for me. I don't even think there was a corking fee!  Can't  wait to return! Let's give this local Carrick business the respect it deserves!"}
{"text":"The food here is as good as everyone is saying.  But let's come back to that.    This humble little Mom and Pop restaurant is on a neglected stretch of Brownsville, near Becks Run Road.  It doesn't look like much from outside, but don't be afraid to go in.  It also doesn't look that great inside, but don't let that bother you.  There's a pizza counter  and a dining room off to the left.    The decor is an eclectic combination of dusty items from an earlier Chinese restaurant, a hookah pipe, and needlehook wall hangings of landmarks that cannot be identified.  There's a Syrian flag hanging with the name of the family written on it in Sharpie.  It smelled of cigarettes when we entered, but I don't know if that's always the case.  It is important to note that the men's room was very clean, that's always nice to see.  But, this isn't the place for a nice date, unless you're both about substance over style.  The service is understated, but efficient and polite.  Pop wasn't a talker, but he seems like a nice guy and regular patrons clearly thought of him as a friend.  It's always nice to see immigrants make an investment in a neglected neighborhood.  The cuisine is a mashup of pizza/hoagies and middle eastern.    We ordered the mezze platter, lamb kabob salad, spinach and lentil soup, and a gyro.  Everything was really good.  There was also plenty of it.  I bought the mezze plate to take home and share with my wife as a snack later.  We fed on it for two days.  The lamb pieces were lean, well done and seasoned with the perfect middle eastern blend of sweet and savory spices.  The tzatzikis was creamy and the perfect accompaniment to the rich savory slices of gyros meat.  The soup was soft and flavorful with a vegetarian tasting base stock.  Compliments to the chef, they do it right.  Bottom line...great food, you need to try it.  If you go take-out you ain't missing much.  But then again, you should enjoy the eat-in vibe at least once."}
{"text":"Consistently great food, and wonderful service. For a local Mediterranean/middle Eastern restaurant, definitely a go to. The owners are awesome, friendly and super appreciative of your business. Everything is always prepared fresh to order, and in quite large portions.  For the location the prices of some things are a bit high, but worth it. The lamb is always tender and the flavor is out of this world. Let's just say try it once, you'll go back."}
{"text":"Seriously, people...eat here!!! Don't put it off until another day, get up & go NOW. Their Chicken Shawarma sandwich is the best I've ever had and it's huge. The Mezza Platter has been so fresh every time we've had it. Tabouleh-YUM, Hummus-YUM, Baba Ghannouj-(to die for)YUM. Can't speak for their American fare because I've never felt the need to try it. If Middle Eastern cuisine is your thing or if you never tried it, but wanted to,...then give this place a try. Enjoy."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and it's been consistently fantastic. The lamb kabob dinner is an absolute feast. We've tried many different menu items and they've all been excellent. The prices are spot on and the owners are extremely friendly. This is a great place to take kids and the chicken tenders will satisfy picky little eaters. It's also BYOB!"}
{"text":"So delicious!  The Shwarma sandwich was outstanding.  The wedgies were huge.  We will be back.  Definitely give this place a try.  Fresh ingredients and fantastic service."}
{"text":"Reliable, tasty, generously portioned gyro in a no-frills Middle-eastern diner setting.   I ordered the lamb gyro. The lamb was shaved (though not charred ideally) and tender. It had adequate seasoning. The sauce was cool and a nice flavor complement to the salty/greasy lamb.   The sandwich was haphazardly topped with way too much lettuce and red onion which left for a harsh bitter aftertaste before I removed these things. Not really a big deal, but shows a lack of concern for proper execution."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!!! The food is to die for from the hummus to the gyro to the sharwama sandwich you can't go wrong. The portions are huge and always made fresh. The owners are great too they are always so nice and you feel like they really care about their customers. Give this independent restaurant a chance you will not regret it."}
{"text":"Great food and fast and friendly service. Plus they are Vegan Friendly!  Super accommodating! The vegan menu items aren't marked,but if you ask hey are happy to explain the veg items to you and even modify items to your needs.  The falafel melts in your mouth and is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Family Restaurant is a place that doesn't have a ton of advertising and isn't in a hot location where you will know of it by passing it, so hopefully these reviews give it the credit it deserves! It is a local restaurant owned by a dedicated and very hardworking couple that strive to give quality food at an affordable price. There is street parking and there are always spaces available.  The building is well lit on the outside and the inside, so you can't miss it on Brownsville road. The ambiance is great in the dining area! The walls and chairs are a deep red and there are a lot of ethnic touches- from vases and trinkets to the wall art. Sam, the owner and his wife are so appreciative of your business and work really hard to make sure you feel satisfied.  Sam is looking to put more of a vegan flare to the place, in which we will see a lot of awesome changes in the future months! It is wonderful to see him expanding the restaurant to fit the needs of the customers! A lot of his foods are already vegan- from the hummus to the fattoush salad, so yes, this place is VEGAN FRIENDLY! All of the ingredients are fresh and combined beautifully in all of the dishes, making your palette ready to thank you afterwards!   Under \"A La Carte\", the hummus appetizer is well worth the $5.50. The serving is large and comes with pita bread for dipping. The chick peas are fresh and with the additional tahini sauce, garlic and lemon- you will be turned off from store bought here on out! The rice pilaf appetizer is good as a meal. Once again, it is a huge serving and the taste is truly wonderful. It tastes fresh, buttery and with the pine nut toppings and seasonings- perfect. It is something you just have to try! $5! Where can you get a quality appetizer for that price?! The loobyeh is great as well! It is a mixture of green beans and tomatoes in what tastes like soup, but that taste is due to the way that it is stewed. It is a wonderful, fresh dish.   Under \"Soups & Salads\", I had the spinach lentil soup, which was filled with spinach and lentils. The taste is not as lemon based and sharp as their other dishes and has a more subtle flavoring. It would be great along with the hummus appetizer. The chicken vegetable soup is good, but is not terribly unique. I would definitely order it again though. The tabboolee salad, WOW! All fresh herbs and vegetables combine (parsley, tomatoes, onions, bulgar wheat, lemon, olive oil) to create the most invigorating, light dish you probably have ever had! Yum! The fattoush salad is my FAVORITE! I would recommend order this salad to anyone who is health conscious, looking to try a unique salad or who wants to gobble down a whole bunch of goodness! The flavors are so powerful and amazing that you can kiss your salads drenched in ranch goodbye!   \"Dinners\" I really enjoyed the kibbee balls- so unique and tasty! You will get two football shaped medium sized balls that are filled with sirloin, bulgar wheat, onions and herbs. The breading that encases these balls is wonderful! I even dipped them in a side of yogurt, which made for an interesting . On Saturdays, they offer RAW kibbee balls, which I have wanted to try SO BAD (because I eat outside of the box ;) ) but I have stopped eating beef, so I will hope that a brave soul tries these and lets us know what they are like!!!   \"Sandwiches\" My FAVORITE dish, aside from the fattoush, is the chicken schwarma. Oh my goodness. The sauce they put on this wrapped pita is like the cucumber sauce you get on gyros but so much better! I could probably eat one of these a day! I order them all of the time and they never get old! I promise you that you won't be disappointed! Oh and the baklava- amazing! If you've never tasted this buttery, syrup filled treat, are you in for a surprise!   They also offer more American based foods, like pizza, wings and hoagies, which are good though I haven't tried much, but the real talent lies in the ethnic dishes! Do me a favor: order outside of the box! Try something new and be adventurous! This is a great restaurant to do it! I just realized that I have gone here so many times and tried so many dishes but this place will have you coming back for more- I'm living proof! :)"}
{"text":"We stopped back again and weren't disappointed.  We had hummus for our starter,  my wife had tabboolee & shawarma platter, I had house salad & combo kabob. It's was delicious & filling.  The owners are very nice also. Always checking on you. Our new go to place.  Go check it out."}
{"text":"I love this place! The owners are so warm and personable and the food is delicious! The prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. There are other restaurants in the area that I enjoy but none of them offer the some type of service-the owners make you feel like family and that goes a long way in my book."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem in Carrick.  Saw the reviews here and decided to give it a try, was not disappointed.  We got a couple of platters and the grape leaves and everything was delicious! Already planning our next visit."}
