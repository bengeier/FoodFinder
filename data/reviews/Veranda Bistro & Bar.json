{"text":"This review to for the Sunday brunch.  They need to up their game NOW...not someday in the near future or don't offer a brunch if this is all you've got. We would have had better food at Bob Evans.  Poor selection at the buffet. Very standard, blah selections.  The food was cold, rubbery, tasteless. Despite having both pancakes and French toast we had to ask for syrup, which was brought to our table with a hunk of cold butter. Can't spread cold butter on cold pancakes.  Our server Alex was wonderful and offered the option of omelette off the menu. That would have been a plus had it been served hot but it wasn't. This was not a $25 brunch....shame on them for charging that for what was offered.  It was cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Found a hidden gem today.  Tucked away in Avon, OH a stones throw from Lake Erie and right outside of Cleveland Is  Veranda Bistro and Bar a warm and inviting place to help combat the wind, snow and the cold outside... Since the temperature outside was dropping I decided to go with the Mussels with its gralic butter and white wine broth and the rich and harty Lamb Shank braised in red wine served with goat cheese whipped potatoes and heirloom carrots and green beans.... the atmosphere was great and the service was as well...definitely going back whenever up up here on a load again"}
{"text":"Bar service is good. Drink pours are NICE.

Food is excellent, bacon wrapped shrimp, shrimp cocktail poached to order and meatball apps...WOW!

Pork Chop, Veranda burger are incredible.

Service is good, bar staff is fun. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We went to Veranda Bistro last night and had a fabulous experience. We had been to the establishment when under different ownership, and Veranda is completely different. All of the dishes had great flavor. The desserts were amazing. This is the best non-chain restaurant in Westlake."}
{"text":"New go to spot! Tony and Angela greeted us at the door. Smart service by Alex. Killer Manhattan! We had the specials: veal porterhouse marsala and chilean sea bass with gnocchi. Both were excellent. The pear/gorgonzola salad is memorable. House made (Angela made) 7 layer carrot cake is indeed decadent. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with 2 other ladies.  Restaurant was not busy and was very cold (temperature).  Service was just okay.  I ordered a cup of French Onion Soup and the hearts of romaine salad and added salmon.  Received 2 grilled romaine hearts with about 8 \"blistered\" tomatoes that lacked flavor or the usual sweetness that comes with blistering a tomato, some shaved parmesan cheese, a small crostini-style piece of bread and dressing on the side.  The salmon had no flavor and didn't seem to be seasoned.  The rest of the salad was just okay.  The french onion soup was room temperature and really lacked flavor with the melted cheese being the best part.  My coworker ordered the cranberry glazed salmon and specifically asked for mashed potatoes instead of the cheesy polenta.  The dish arrived with what appeared to be polenta but the waitress assured her it was potatoes.  Well...it wasn't.  My coworker did eat the polenta because she didn't want to send the dish back but was disappointed.  My other coworker had the pear and gorgonzola salad and she did enjoy it.  We were not offered dessert and asked about it and was told by our waitress that she would have to check to see what they had.  Upon return we were advised that all they had was carrot cake and that the manager had just run out to purchase the dessert options for the day.  Overall a disappointing experience and I do not plan to return."}
{"text":"Went there last Monday for Happy Hour. There were four of us and we wanted a table.  We were greeted with you can sit wherever you want.  How many places do that?  There's usually so many restrictions, they allowed us to sit outside although the weather wasn't great and it really wasn't open.  We got great service and the foood was really good!  Thanks so much for welcoming us--we had a great time and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant a 10 I would.  The menu offers a good selection.  Highly recommend the lamb shank, however someone in our party had the pork chop, which was recommended by the waiter, and it too was beyond grand.  The service was top notch.  Entrees were beautifully presented and served at just the right temperature.  It is quite obvious that the staff really wants to please.  So glad we found this gem!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by to have an early dinner and a cocktail. This is truly one of the coziest restaurants I have been in a long time.  We popped in the bar for Happy Hour and ended up having our meal there. Matt the bartender made us feel like we have been coming there for years. The Southern Comfort Manhattans were outstanding. The owner Tony stopped by to greet us and welcome us to the restaurant. We thought this was extremely nice as he did notice that it was our first time there. We took a recommendation from Matt and had the lamb shank and pork chop...they did not disappoint. The carrot cake was a great way to end our outstanding meal. I could not help but notice how happy the staff seemd to be. It seemed as though they were welcoming you into their home and were delighted to have you. As a previous review stated this is a hidden \"gem.\" We will certainly visit again and make sure we recommend it to our friends."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled, this is the same restaurant as Rue 254. We went thinking that even if it was just rebranded, it may have improved. We were wrong! Same super loud and awkward environment, same overpriced, underwhelming options. I was far from impressed. The food all sounds delicious on the menu and upon arrival was a mismatched display of mistakes. Food temps go from burning hot  to ice cold in other areas, salad was a total mess and desserts were just not tasty, and resembled frozen box cakes. Sadly, unless the entire establishment switches hands in ownership- we will not be returning."}
{"text":"We stopped in first time today for lunch and were very pleased with the meal and service. 
Veranda burger and chicken Marsala were very good. Cosmo and dirty martini were also good. 
Would recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"The ambiance and service is great. I've been in multiple times for apps and drinks and everything was fantastic. I came in for lunch and was disappointed in that the menu was pretty heavy and did not include many options for being a vegetarian.  For a picky eater, it would be hard to find a simple dish. Menu items did seem very tasty by descriptions tho. The average price of the menu was $15. The restaurant was not crowded on the day we ate, so the staff was sitting outside on a break, visible to diners..and smoking. Slight turn off to us diners. I would recommend eating on the patio in the summer as it is charming."}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience during our first visit to the new establishment. The restaurant was not crowded on this Saturday evening, allowing the server to be extremely prompt & attentive. The appetizers were very good and the presentation of the entrees was excellent. We did encounter an issue with one of the orders, but it was corrected to our satisfaction immediately. Finally, the homemade desserts topped off an outstanding dinner.
The menu prices are quite reasonable and if this was indicitive of Veranda's standards, I am sure it will become more & more difficult for patrons to get a table. Highly recommended and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed by our stop today.  I am a Westlake resident and was hoping that under new management this establishment would be an improvement from what it had been, but sadly, it is not.

Server/bartender was prompt to greet and get our coffee.....but then disappeared for so long that I had to go find her at the bar to inquire if someone else was going to be taking our order - nope, she was it.

We placed our order and waited an adequate amount of time for the food to be brought out.  However, when the food came to the table, while Seasoned properly, it was all room temperature. The server was not prompt to come over and check on how the food was and at this point there are only two guests at the bar and 3 additional small tables with guests in the seating area. Additionally, the menu said that the salmon was to be accompanied by green beans but came out with 2 stalks of broccolini.  Also, I felt for $14 that the chunk of salmon should've been slightly larger than what you see in the attached picture (not sure if photo does it justice, it was smaller than the palm of my hand). We shared our concerns with the server, and while she apologize profusely, she said there was truly nothing else she could do about the situation because there was not a manager available. 

Skip this restaurant and hit one of other restaurants available just a stones throw down the road in Crocker Park instead."}
{"text":"Call me a picky sumbitch, I'll own it. Veranda Bistro & Bar is the latest incarnation of an eatery located in this converted house across the street from a funeral home. I believe it was Rue 254 or some such before? At any rate, it's not that I'd say it wasn't worth the $100+ bill on dinner for two, seriously, it's just on the cusp of 5-stardom for me. It's so close to the precipice that a lilting breeze may cause it to topple. Yet close it remains.

Oh gentle reader, please allow me to summarize - old, white guy pricey, incredibly friendly service, spot-on tableside attention, beautifully prepared, tasty dishes with spotty, albeit minor execution flaws, and ho-hum decor reminiscent of a time-locked country club nook.

Upon entering, we were immediately greeted by a gentleman with an unbridled enthusiasm of a Seinfeldian Billy Mumphrey. Smiles, jovial conviviality. In the words of Sir James Lipton, he was a delight. Moving down the entryway toward the bar, a quick left and into the main dining area. There's a patio out back as well but, alas, we remained inside. Just not quite warm enough for us. 

The decor is, well, it's nice. Plenty of natural light, maybe 10 tables or so. For some reason it just didn't feel all that cozy. Perhaps it was the high-traffic carpet squares or the metal-backed chairs with their minimalist gluteal padding. It was like diner with white table cloths. For a high-dollar place like this, it simply feels out of place.

Our server was about as pleasant as could be. She managed our table with an expertise and ease that could have only come from years of service industry experience. She was equal parts prompt, attentive and friendly. A definite highlight of our visit.

On the subject of potent potables, Veranda clearly caters to the wine set. Their drinks menu is about 90% populated by the grape stuff with a sideways glance to some fancy mixologist-type beverages (my wife was very happy with her martini). Beer, unfortunately, is but an afterthought here with half of the draught handles occupied by boring macro swill and the other half peppered with equally unexciting crafts. My biggest issue - the pricing. $7 for a locally brewed, nothing special beer. Out. Of. Line. I don't expect all places to be 20-tap gastropubs, just throw a bone on occasion, folks.

The food was, on the whole, a very delicious and well-done experience. I'd even go as far as to say very good. All of the dishes featured spot-on attention to detail in their presentation. The salads were both fresh, balanced and well-dressed. The bread service a tiny basket of crispy outside warm, air-pocked glutinous magic inside deliciousness. The chicken tortilla soup was abuela's hug comforting, well-spiced with just a touch of heat. The salmon served atop my wife's pear and gorgonzola salad was beautifully caramelized and seasoned with a deft hand and the wild mushroom risotto was, dare I say it, brilliant. 

But...

The dishes that failed to hit suffered not from major, gaping flaws in taste, but from minor, some may say, nitpickish shortcomings. The short rib app - pull-apart tender, juicy, beefy - atop a lovely bed of soft, cheesy polenta. Missing from this savory party, salt. Nearly devoid of it, actually. The roasted brussels sprouts had a tantalizing caramelization but were clearly taken from the oven prematurely. Two words on roasted brussels, people - fork tender.

For me, as I believe it should be for all of us, there is a direct correlation between sensitivity to mistakes and the ability to overlook them and the pricetag owners place on their establishment. Standards vary, for sure, but if you hold yourself up higher, it's a less stable footing. Veranda is a high-priced dining experience with all the trappings - $10 salads, $11 cocktails, $15 burger - and some serious potential. Simple dishes must be executed without flaw and consistently so. I cannot speak for consistency as this was our first visit, but spotless execution seemed to elude us at this eatery.

Total Bill: $98 (without tip, included $36 for two mixed drinks and two beers)"}
{"text":"Happy hour on the patio!
Excellent patio, excellent staff, great happy hour menu!
Our servers, Mike & Haley were great! Met the owner/manager Tony, and he was very nice.
Would recommend this venue for a pleasant, relaxing time."}
{"text":"Went with a friend late on a Saturday afternoon before going to a concert.  We each ordered an appetizer and a salad. I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp that was served over cheesy grits. Delicious. The bacon was crisp and tasty. The grits were creamy, smooth, and flavorful. My friend got the shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were the largest shrimp I've ever seen in a shrimp cocktail. We each got a Veranda salad. The ingredients were crisp and fresh and the salad was flavorful.  The service was excellent--attentive but not obtrusive.  This is a place I will definitely return to."}
{"text":"Very good . In old Millers location
Brussels sprouts and bacon side very good
Tried NY strip also very good SIDES GOOD TOO"}
{"text":"Good first experience here. Brunch menu was great and I'll be back even if it's just to make our way through the brunch menu and sit on the patio. My Creme Brûlée brioche French toast was fantastic but the sausage on the side was a little dry and bland - not bad, just not exciting. My husbands chicken and waffles had great flavor, but the chicken was definitely a little dry. Good drink options, lovely patio, great service. In all, it wasn't quite perfect, but we won't hesitate to go back to try dinner or happy hour."}
{"text":"Upon entering the foyer it is nicely decorated; however, upon entering the restaurant I was a little disappointed in the decor. The patio looks nice but it was closed due to cool weather the evening we were there.  The food was average.  The thing that dropped my review rating was our server, Dave.  He seemed very disengaged the moment he approached our table.  He was unfriendly, short, and he honestly made us feel uncomfortable.  His mannerisms seemed the same at other tables as well.  He did not offer to tell us about the special of the night until we asked if there were any.  Additionally, my friend ordered a dirty martini that came back not \"dirty\".  She asked to have the drink remade which Dave was clearly irritated with.  When she ordered a second drink, she specified that she wanted made the way the remade drink was and not the first.  Dave's response to us was \"I don't think we will make it like that after what we just went through.\"  I am disappointed at the way we were treated and if I return to this restaurant I will probably specifically ask that this server does not wait on us."}
{"text":"First visit but won't be our last. Great menu with lots of options no matter what your in the mood for. And if they don't have it on the menu they will still make it. Met the owner Tony and he is truly interested in making your dining experience as good as he can. 

Looking forward to our next visit. I had the scallops and they were awesome!!"}
{"text":"Best steak in Ohio. Piedmontese beef??  Really. They best to be had. 5 stars all the way."}
