{"text":"Julianna and Sam were such a delight! So sweet and nice and I will definitely be back, great service (:"}
{"text":"Went to Dillions for a birthday. Our server Kaitlyn was fantastic! She was personal, fast and just made our night!!!  Spoke to the manager and he was just as great! FOOD was out of this world!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"My sister in law and I ordered one of their popular cocktails.  I had had them before.  They both came not looking like they usually do.  Hers actually tasted like an alcoholic drink but mine tasted like straight pineapple juice.  My sister in law decided to go to bat for me and walked up to the bar to ask for it to be remade.  The young female bartender was reluctant but did end up redoing it.  Never should have had to in the first place.  SMH!  Need to retrain your bartender about customer service and how to make one of your \"signature\" cocktails!!!"}
{"text":"Can't say much for the food because we left after putting our name on the list. They were totally understaffed. Lots of open space and tables but no servers. Waiting list was about 12 parties."}
{"text":"Very fun place , right on the lake so you can sit and watch the boats , really kid friendly. Food is good , staff is very happy . We go there a lot"}
{"text":"Lousy service. The waitress ignored us to the point that the hostess had to take our order and the kitchen staff brought us our food. The place was not busy, so I'm not sure why this happened. I had to track someone down to ask for my bill. I left a 0 tip, something I have never done before."}
{"text":"My family & I went there for Mothers day, yesterday 05/08/2016. My mom loves the lake and we thought it would be a great atmosphere. I did not mind the $6.00 to get in as I know the money goes to help the area and I had no problem getting a golf cart shuttle to and from the restaurant. We did however, not have a good experience at the restaurant. We arrived at 10AM. We were seated and given lunch menus. After 20 minutes passed with no one approaching our table, I walked back to the hostess area and they seamed dumbfounded and said they would see what they could do. A few minutes later a woman who was a manger came over to see us and all of the drinks we ordered they were out of so we chose others, she brought our drinks back and went to take our order only to find out they are not even serving lunch and the manager went and got us menus for breakfast. When the food arrived it was mediocre and small portions for the price.  So, between not having any drinks, bad service, given wrong menus & mediocre food, it was a disappointment. The atmosphere was fun though."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences I've had in a long time.  Unlike the Dillon's located on Thunderbird Rd, in Peoria, which I rated 5 stars, I was disappointed to find that this location didn't have the full menu offered by Peoria,. No ribs at all.  Mostly sandwiches..  You would think that being located on a boat dock, you would be able to enjoy looking at the water and boats as you dined,  but unless you stood up from your table, there's no way to see the lake. Also,  the music was way too loud to be able to talk to your partner while eating. And  $6 for parking?  Ridiculous!  This was the first time and the last time for the Lake Pleasant location."}
{"text":"Lake Pleasant location is so noisy. Music was so loud, we had to yell just to talk to other people at our table. Drinks were served in plastic cups. Hostess seated our party of 4 at a high top table. She dropped off the menus and left, even though only 2 stools at the table. We found 2 more stools to bring over to the table and moved the table a bit to get one of the stools in since it was so close to another table. Waitress served incorrect beverages and forgot to calculate the Groupon discount. Had to track her down to fix. Credit card machine not working, so I did not get a copy of the receipt. Was charged $10 too much according to my bank statement. Had to pay $6 to park and then wait for a shuttle that expected a tip.  I like Dillon's food, but will not go to this particular location again."}
{"text":"Awful. Over priced and the food is terrible.  My sister received GRAY scrambled eggs, which the manager tried to explain away as being normal. Our food was cold, the hash brown patties looked like toaster hash browns, the sausage was obviously from a warming tray, and it looked like the eggs were from a carton. I scanned the menu to check prices of other items and just about fell out of my chair! $14 chicken strips,  $11 chili dog. This place is a complete rip off. Don't let the lakeside view and decor make you think it's high quality. IT'S NOT!"}
{"text":"Brought my wife and two children ages 8 and 10 and the dog! Perfect setting for casual Saturday night dinner on the lake. Fun live music band played familiar rock n roll hits and service was fast. My bbq sandwich had sweet flavor and was a sizeable portion. My wife enjoyed her trout. If you bring your dog you can sit outside on patio, thats where you want to be - right on the water! All staff was friendly and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I finally made it out to this Dillon's, have been wanting to go for awhile now! I have been to all of the locations in town and love them. This location i now love too! You do have to pay $6 to get into the park, but to be able to eat right on the water with a great view made it worth it. The location is very large and has a great area for entertainment, which the bartender told me they have every Saturday and Friday night. I opted to sit up at the bar and the bartender was great, very personable and also very knowledgeable seeing as i did ask a lot of questions. I order the burnt ends and they were great just like the locations in town. The manager even came over and asked me how everything was which i was impressed with. I have to say if you are in the mood for some good bbq and want to go somewhere different then Dillon's at lake pleasant is a perfect spot to go. You even get to catch a golf cart ride up to uour car when your done, which I needed after stuffing myself!"}
{"text":"Food is ordinary, not bad but not particularly good. Service was agonizingly slow even though it was not crowded. The restaurant is very big and open and quite noisy. The view of the lake is just a view of a small inlet. With the six dollar charge to get into Pleasant Harbor, then wait for the shuttle ride down to the restaurant, it is just not worth it.   Keli, thanks for your response. We are not big barbecue fans so we don't go often but we always enjoyed Dillons in Arrowhead and Peoria. And we visited regularly when you were at Scorpion Bay. But the Pleasant Harbor venue just doesn't come up to other locations standards, IMO. I'm sure you had good business reasons to relocate but I liked the other place better."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  Hard to understand those that complained about the shuttle and $6 parking fee as the shuttle was a nice part of the evening and quite convenient. Service, food and drink were excellent for the price.  Thanks to Mackenzie for the lovely service and fun personality. The brisket was super, as well as the Casamigo tequila."}
{"text":"Delightfully simple at a reasonable price.  Unique way of getting somewhere to eat, by shuttle down to and onto the floating restaurant!  Don't be in a hurry if you choose to eat here.  Just relax enjoy the ride and simple good foods while watching the water and boats.  We had a great time."}
{"text":"This is the worst Dillons I've ever had an experience with. First hint of bad service, server is nowhere near to be found as happy hour is ending. I have to walk over to a group of 4 servers who are gossiping in the corner with nobody working and tell them To please let our server know we would like to order before happy hour ends (and save 50 cents woohoo). One comes over and takes our order just to come back and say the computer already switched the times (now that it's 7:01) out of principal alone this was annoying. The $16 burnt ends were dry, bland, and left a lot to be desired. Mac n cheese was great that's about it. Then we go to leave and our server doesn't remember to give our ID's back that they had to take because we ordered a Moscow mule, which is served in the nice copper cups that people like to steal. So we have to go all the back to the lake in BFE just to get our ID's and the woman who answers HAS THE AUDACITY to nearly deny leaving our ID's  at the Guard Tower to avoid paying for $6 parking and waiting 10 minutes for a golf cart to pick us up for the walk down. Had to call back 3 times and speak to the manager to confirm they would bring them to the gaurd tower. I'll never be back."}
{"text":"Great scenery and sports bar. The food is not something to go here for.  It's just ok but don't tell your friends to go here just to eat."}
{"text":"First, ignore the whinny people who complain about parking, the shuttle, etc.  It's on a lake!  It is ON the actual lake, not near it or next to it.  Where did you think you were going, Hyatt Regency!!  Do you really expect to have parking on the lake?  Come on, getting there is half the fun,  if you have the right party attitude.  ITS ON THE LAKE.  take a chill, relax, oh and by the way, you had to unload the kids, blah blah. Come on it's a sports BAR.  Take the kids to Chuckie Cheese.  Great bar, great food, a bit slow sometimes with the drinks.  But you will have fun if you have the Jimmy Buffet attitude that you are going to have a good time ON THE LAKE.  Also, great music on the weekends.  Like all the other Dillon's, we enjoy each and every time we go.   And by the way, if you chat up the golf cart guy, they can be real fun and you are already enjoying your time before you even get there."}
{"text":"Do you go to Dillon's because it's at the lake.. or do go to the lake because Dillon's is there??? For us it because Dillon's was at the Lake! Great, courteous,  prompt outdoor service by our waitress Jordyn! Food was Great and dog friendly! Good job guys!"}
{"text":"If this is for Lake Pleasant...here it is, if not, still for Lake Pleasant .  Bigger than when it was at Scorpion Bay (2 years gone from there).  Decent seating areas, a little smaller for total outside area, but huge windows open up,  weather permitting,  and is nice.   Saturday, 2:30 pm, great weather, a 20 to 30 min wait, not bad.  Bellied up to bar...took about 8 min to get a drink.  Sat over in waiting area, no one else waiting for tables at that time...20 min more finally asked hostesses, you could tell we were forgotten, really we sat two feet away from them, only ones there!!!  Right away we were ushered out got outside area, past 4 empty tables...service from Nick, ok, very quiet, not much going on with him...brisket sandwich was good as well steak fries, but meat was cold.  Fire something spicy pulled pork and sausage sandwich good also...  I think when you have such a great location, it should be more somehow.  Every server I witnessed,  employ, etc. seemed stressed and in a bad mood!?!   I will definitely go back because it's fun on the lake...  A short pontoon boat  ride  to restaurant is nice, and shuttle service is great to and from parking areas."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful lunch with family. The burgers are great. Beautiful view of the lake."}
{"text":"Very good food have eaten several different dishes all good service is always pretty good loud and busy but that's ok worth it,different setup considering your on the lake makes interesting worth the visit"}
{"text":"Wonderful evening on the lake!   When was the last time 2 managers stopped by your table to make sure everything is great...   Braxton and TJ both with warm wishes on our anniversary and server Erica checked on us many times with her charming smile.  The food was a perfect 10 and the cheesecake was delish!  Will be back with the kiddos for another fun and unique evening!"}
{"text":"You have to pay to get into Lake Pleasant, which if you're just going to eat kind of sucks, but it is what it is. I enjoyed the trip on the golf cart and pontoon to and from the restaurant. It added to the experience and it's always nice to go out on the water, even if it is only for a few minutes.   The restaurant itself was decent and the food was good. The prickly pear lemonade is delicious! The environment was fun and the views were nice. You can walk the small deck outside to watch the sunset if you're eating inside or get a table outside if they're available. As to be expected, since it is on the water, there are bugs...lots of bugs, but they go after the lights and not your food. Our waitress, Patricia, was amazing and very attentive to our needs, but not overbearing. She was great and really friendly. There is live music and games to play.  Overall it was a great family supper for our group.  I just wanted to add that in addition to our server Patricia being amazing so were all of the rest of the staff that we interacted with from the girls who sat us and the people who bussed our tables...they were all every friendly."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends. This is a great place to go.  They do not have a happy hour but thats ok the views were what makes it.  Its all Dillons food but somehow being on the water makes it much diffetent.  They told us about a slide that they are putting in largest that Guiness book of world records was coming out there to record the slide.  This place is great to bring out of town guest or to go after a day on the lake."}
{"text":"Yo yo yo AZ peeps  if you really want a kick back enjoyable Sunday with a good munch and drinks head out to Dillion's on the Harbor at lake Pleasant . So relaxing and so much fun!"}
{"text":"Pay to enter parking lot, tip golf cart driver, tip captain of ferry, tip ferry again,tip golf cart driver again to go back to your car; the food was mediocre, the service was slow!  Once was more than enough! It's not like there is any other way to get there!"}
{"text":"Absolute Horrible customer Service. I have never been treated so horrible at a restaurant. Tried to get reservations two days in advance  for my daughter's birthday and they said they don't take reservations but to just come on in and it wouldn't be a problem. then when we went in, with the five children we had planned the bday party with, and they  told us it was a two hour wait I asked to speak to a manager and then when I got upset at the wait with 5 children, And their policy and lack of desire to try and Help us  or do more..... when I spoke to Manager and told him that I had tried to plan the birthday party for in advance, and his solution was to offer for me to be escorted out by their sheriff deputies because I said this was bull shi$. What a joke. I am a successful business owner whom was trying to plan my daughter bday in advance and has been a patron of lake pleasant for many years. We own our own business and I would never in my life  treat our customers this way! The Manager whom I asked to speak to was a young 20 year old who treated me like a imbosal rather than the veteran, returning clientele, business owners that I am.  I am sorry sir but your disrespectful attitude just lost a long time patron. I in NO WAY deserved to be treated the way ya I was.  And I will be sure to ask my friends and fellow clientele to support elsewhere. It's sad that you couldn't even try and support a. 12 year olds bday wish.  Shame on you for treating your customers so poorly. As we are long time, locals who frequent the lake, we will be sure to pack the cooler and not continue to support your restaurant ! By the way, wild horse cafe down the road was fabulous! We will support them instead!"}
{"text":"Access to this place is terrible! Gate keeper charges $6 just to drive to the lot! Rude too! No parking validation once inside. Why did Dillion's move from Scorpion Bay? You're losing customers Dillons..."}
{"text":"Food was good. A little pricey for the portion size. Just a heads up.  Service was slow like molasses. We requested outside table. When we were seated, it was not what we wanted and the host told us it'll be ANOTHER 15 minutes wait. Bleh! Boo! : ("}
{"text":"Another great meal at Dillon's. My brisket sandwich was crazy good with a huge smoke ring all around the meat. They always pack the roll in a circle with way too much brisket, but as usual I ate it all up with ease. The onion rings are always a highlight and regular fries were good as well. The turkey in the AZ turkey sandwich was tender and hot and the mac and cheese had that good stickiness. We bought a groupon as well getting $30 worth of food for $17, which is a great deal in my opinion.      I know Dillon's is on the water, but they should still have a policy that you need a shirt on your body to eat. The two two fat bellied guys who dined shirtless need to be clothed or else I will lose my appetite very quickly."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Dillon's when they were at Scorpion Bay for a few years. Love the new and expanded location. I can't speak for the car parking/walking/shuttle situation because we usually come in by boat. The food quality was mixed. My brisket sandwich had good flavor, but the meat was dry as was my daughter-in-law's brisket sandwich. My son and my wife's food was good. Even at the old location Dillon's food was always good, not great. Dillon's Bayou compared to the old restaurant at Pleasant Harbor is a night and day improvement. This place has the same energy and vibe as the old Dillon's at SB, only bigger and better. We will be back."}
{"text":"I do not know why they're only rated 3 stars. I love this place! I've been coming since they relocated to the old Waterfront Grill. Best smoked turkey and Arizona stew hands down. I get the Arizona stew every time and it always tastes exactly the same give or take the spiciness. People swear by their BBQ options. The ribs are quite good. They have a unique drink menu too. I love the Grape Otter Pop and Pink Flamingo.   Lake view. Patio seating. Sports on TV. Live bands on the weekends. Nearby cruise boat. Nowhere else like it in Arizona. It's a favorite of this Arizona native."}
{"text":"I am writing this as I am sitting waiting for a table which I was told will be more than an hour wait even though I have been looking at 7 open tables for 20 minutes. The hostess was extremely rude when we asked why we couldn't be seated to one of the open tables since nobody was in front of us and we were told that they were holding the tables for \"members\". Still sitting here another 15 minutes later and nobody is sitting at the tables. If this is how the treat people just trying to be seated I can't imagine what the actual waitress is like. Here's to hoping my food is warm.   Edit. Down to one star.  We ordered to go. And chose an outside seating spot where immediately we were greeted by a waiter. All of our orders were wrong or took an excessive amount of time (40 minutes) to come out."}
{"text":"I have to call our visit to Dillons on Lake Pleasant an \"experience\". You arrive to find that you have to pay for parking  in the middle of no where. Then you are taken by a golf cart down the hill to a landing where you walk a very unlevel dock area , where you have to wait for a pontoon to pick you up and take you to the marina area. Apparently there was a storm last year that tore up the dock where the golf carts used to drive you directly to the restaurant and Marina area. The whole thing is rather shoddy. There are tip jars on the golf carts and On the Pontoon and labels on every seat to remind you to tip.  As far as the restaurant itself it is what you expect of a place on the water. Nothing fancy.  Dillons is known for their excellent ribs but this restaurant does not even serve ribs at that location. Big disappointment.  The food I must say was good. everyone of us enjoyed our dinners. However the waitress was a complete ditz. He daily special was a steak sandwich. I asked what cut the steak was and she came back grinning with the answer Angus. Apparently nobody knew what it was whether it be a sirloin or whatever. We had onion rings as an appetizer and they were delicious and inexpensive. Taco salads we're fresh and tasty. The beef brisket was tender but dry. We had to flag the waitress down several times in order to get refills on our drinks. The reverse trip back to the parking lot on the pontoon was also a challenge. As the driver left to go help someone else and we were left sitting in the sun waiting for him to come back. Then when we arrived at the end of the dock and we're waiting for the golf cart other people cut in line and jumped on the card ahead of us so we were left sitting in the sun there as well. They have no organization in that regard and there was only one golf cart driver. The whole thing was an experience and one which we've done and would not do it again. It's not worth the hassle to go there"}
{"text":"We came to celebrate our friends birthday and they took such great care of us! We got seating right by the band outside, the food recommendations were so spot on. THe food was amazing!  Kaitlyn took amazing care of us and made this a wonderful experience! They went above and beyond to make this perfect! I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch with great service!  This was my second trip. The barbecue is great I've tried the pulled pork, pulled chicken and brisket. Salads are excellent. Special kudos to Kyllene, our server. Great personality, knows the menu and makes great suggestions.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Dillon's was awesome! There's something about Mary that keeps me coming back for more! Great food and Kristen rocks too!"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. We are members at lake pleasant so we go here often. Yes, if you aren't members, you have to pay $6 to get into the park. Yes, you have to park up top and walk downhill about 1/4 of a mile or call the golf cart to come and get you. In exchange for your trouble, you will see beautiful views, wildlife, desert plants, the lake, the boats and you can dine on some good bbq and watch the sun set. The service is so much better now that it's Dillion's.  The lake is fun and the atmosphere is casual.  Green chili stew in winter. Anything else in summer."}
{"text":"This location is by far my favorite. The only down side is the fee to get in and then paying to eats but you are taken by shuttle down to the restaurant. The food is always really good and comes in large portions. The view of the lake is beautiful. Such a neat place here in the desert!"}
{"text":"Go for the atmosphere not for the food. My food was cold, nachos were not even average and cold, sent them back. Waitress forgot to bring my friends side dish. The food was all overpriced and below average in taste in our party of five. Service in all honesty was excellent and the place is a good place to take out of town guest for a cocktail. I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Was told the wait would be under 20 minutes. Waited for close to an hour before we left. Atmosphere is cool and drinks are good but to spend 6$ to park and walk down to the marina. Not worth it. So many better places to go for 1/2 the hassle."}
{"text":"A must go place If your visiting or living in Phoenix. The restaurant is huge, very alive, food is amazing, staff is friendly and the view is unbelievable.   Carly & Kelsey the bar tenders made me a bomb a$$ drink."}
{"text":"Beware Dillon's at Lake Pleasant. After a 1-1/2 drive from Gilbert we begin our evening with $6 to park. Then we wait 15 min in a long line to catch a shuttle golf cart to the Lake. After \"mandatory\" tipping of the driver, we arrive at the water's edge for a second and longer line. 20 min later the shuttle boat arrives to take us to Dillon's.  35 min total from the parking lot to the restaurant, I skipped the obligatory tip to the boat driver. Once in the restaurant we were given a buzzer and told it'll be 40 - 50 min so we go to the bar. My wife orders a pop and I order a domestic beer, and ask to see the menu. We had been told about the great ribs at Dillons from friends which prompted us to go here. When we don't see ribs at on the menu we inquire about them from the bar waitress. She says oh we don't have ribs. I said you don't mention that on your website and you don't mention paid parking and 35 min commutes from the parking lot. She said, I've never heard anyone else complain.  I said, well I guess you've now heard it here first and I will tell people on Yelp. That's when she developed a major attitude. With that attitude, I said we'll take the check. $9.40 for pop and domestic. We didn't take a sip of either, paid the tab and left. I was furious at this point, and the caveliere attitude of the bar waitress escalated the situation. Being the end of the day with a lot of people leaving the lake, the reverse commute to our car took 45 min total between the shuttle boat and golf cart. That's one hour 20 min for round trip and to think I had to pay and tip for the privilege.  To all, including the round trip commute and the wait, you're looking at 2+ hours to get a very limited Dillon's menu.  Never again for us. And since leopards don't change their spots, I have no intention of visiting any of their other locations."}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the ruff. We're in the desert, but here is a beautiful lake surrounded by saguaros and in the middle marina is Dillon's BBQ. Awesome food and cold beer with amazing views. Getting here is half the fun. Take a golf car ride to the lake, then a pontoon boat ride to the restaurant. My first experience was Great. I can't wait to experience the live weekend music and watch the sunset."}
{"text":"I write one star reviews very rarely. This one has to be written. This has to be THE worst dining experience I've had in many years. This place has SO much potential. It's on a beautiful lake, for goodness sakes! Dillon's has moved over from Scorpion Bay to this location and so much can be SO amazing here. Summer isn't even here quite yet and I can tell you that they missed the mark the other night from every angle that they possibly could when we decided to dine here. I felt like kids were running this place! It was like NO one cared and how fast can closing come so we can get out of here! On this day we were visiting  our friends who dock their boat here , we walked over about 515pm for dinner and wine on this particular beautiful evening. The outside seating was full, ( not that we were asked if we wanted to wait) , so we were seated inside and were not addressed by our waitress for several minutes. She did arrive and apologized that there were only two of them that evening to , 'bear with them'. We noticed that there seemed to be two girls and about six guys ? doing something? And just one bartender. We finally ordered several minutes later: a Reisling; a starter of Fried Pickles; an order of Chicken Tenders ( Fries and Cole Slaw side) ; a Pulled Pork Sandwich with BBQ Beans and my BBQ Turkey with a Salad and Mac/Cheese for the side. Reisling comes in a plastic glass that looks like a cheap wedding reception from the 1970's! It's pretty funny, actually! But the problems began when our meals arrived before the starter. Who doesn't dislike that? As the guy goes to place my meal... he knocks over an entire full ice water ALL over me, my phone, into my brand new Kate Spade bag! We grab the bag and the iPhone .. The expensive things! I can dry eventually! The poor guy is embarrassed and just kind of stands there; The waitress is what makes it bad. 'Are you okay? Your not really all that wet, are you ? Your phone... I mean, it's turning on now, isn't it?' We suggested we move. Not her. She just acted like she didn't care a bit! Meanwhile our food was placed and had now gotten cold during this water fiasco. And yes. I was soaked from my left legs to my booty...to my right leg! I was wearing running pants and it has that material in black that whisks away moisture. On to the meal. Horrible. My turkey was dry & ice cold on the slices on the ends. It was so dry it was almost not chewable ! As if it had been heated in a microwave. All of the meals were now cooled in the fiasco that she didn't care to even attempt to fix , reheat? OR re do!! Some kid comes over now, 'Are you okay'? I was. Another one. Who I swear.. seemed high, as he had to ask and re ask the same thing because he was not understandable. NO. The wine had tipped and now had less than a sip in it, someone at the table joked! He didn't get it. ( That was a hint: Replace the wine the employee tipped over ??!) We had not got our starter YET or my salad OR one of the other sides! The waitress brings the cold Fried Pickles and goes on and on about how the kitchen is 'really messing those tickets up lately' ... Then says ' You know that was not his fault ( the water incident); I've done that a 100 times and it happens!' OF course I know it's not his fault!!!! What is the fault now is you acting like this is not any big deal to me... our meal...& me sitting here wet. I get that accidents happen.. it's the follow up that makes or breaks the situation. The bill comes and I am now a little beyond upset & I said , 'Okay my dinner needs to come off this bill... right.now.' Because we had been charged full for every thing that was wrong with this meal. How appalling is that?? She was genuinely confused. A bit goes by. I see rolling eyes from her and whispers with her and her co workers as they roll silver for the next day's opening , ( the restaurant is now closed). She took the meal off and comp'd us a cheesecake. NOT one person seeming like a manager came over; Not once did this waitress seem to care.. our meal was screwed up even without the water all over me! Learn how to take care of customers and get it together. This place has THE absolute best position for business on the lake! GO with that and make it wonderful! This was anything but... I rode back to PHX wet.. and placed my iPhone in rice :) Thanks for the stressful meal on the beautiful lake! Jeesh!"}
{"text":"First time there. The food was okay, not great for the price. And it's all overpriced. They've built a brand (4 locations), so they can charge those prices, but I doubt we'll be going back. I'm sure there are other BBQ restaurants out there that have better food for the price. Best part was being able to sit outside on Lake Pleasant, other than that, it was very underwhelming. Except for the music. If you like a loud, party-time atmosphere, this is your place!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth your time. Terrible service. Got our order wrong. Extra large wait with open tables."}
{"text":"We arrived 11/12/2017 for lunch with our meet up group. Fourteen adults total.   Their was a discrepancy because our host had called the day prior to ask if they would be playing the football games and she was informed they would be as long as they were on cable.   When we arrived we were informed that we were misinformed and they would not be playing any of the football games. One of the couples had an issue and left, the rest of us understood and stayed to have lunch. The manager was apologetic and empathized. He did seem sincere. Comped the table with appetizers.   Server was a sweetheart and was pretty attentive with our table and was nice enough to split all of our checks per couple.   The food however was not over the top. I can only speak for my husband and I but it is not a restaurant we will go out of our way to attend again. Nothing was wrong with it but there sure were not flavorful as were were expecting.     For 2 drinks (Soda and tea) and our lunch it was $33.00."}
{"text":"Just had the worst experience ever at Dillons. I've been many times before and this was a one time issue but it just outweighs the good experiences. I checked in for a group of 6 adults and 2 toddlers. They told me it would be a 25 minute wait but it turned into an hour and 20 minutes!! Not because the restaurant was more pack or anything like that. It was simply because they crossed our name off the list. There seemed to be no reason for it, \"it just happens sometimes\". With the girls being very young they didn't seem to be too bothered with their own mistake. They simply said they would try to get us another table soon. What great customer service."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving this place a two is because of the spectacular views and my waitress was friendly, not very efficient but friendly. We came on a Sunday at 11 o'clock.  The restaurant was not to busy when we got there. We were seated right away and sat for a bit till a waitress told us that she was sorry for the wait but he waitress that was supposed to help us had not shown up for work yet.  We were not in a hurry since we were at the lake for the day and we decided to eat at Dillion's instead of packing lunches. Big mistake!!!! I have eaten at Dillion's at the zoo and Dillion's on Thunderbird and I am always pleased. Today it saddens me to put this on here but YOUR FOOD BITES! how can you screw up chicken strips? Children's grilled cheese on Texas toast was burnt. How much bread do you want to serve with one slice of cheese. Hint to the chef, The reason you burnt the bread is because it had to cook it so long to get through that the toast to melt the cheese. My wife ordered the chicken strips. The breading was disgusting there was no life to this food. My wife was only able to stomach eating two of the pieces of chicken.  Last, my $17 fish plate I think they called it Guinness Cod was about the worst fish I have ever had, and I do mean ever!  Before I even began to eat my fish I asked for malted vinegar to the kitchen staff that delivered the food to the table.  When he returned he gave me a bottle that had 1/4 of a teaspoon of vinegar in it. No Joke!!! We all looked at each other in disbelief that he really drop that off at the table and mumbled this is all he could find.  When we had ordered our drinks we had told the wait staff that the two cokes that they had delivered to the table were diet. The waitress had responded that multiple people had stated that it did taste weird. Instead of problem-solving and trying to figure out what was wrong with the soda that may have been installed incorrectly and was coming out as diet instead of regular Coke we passed it off as it just has a little weird taste to it.  We ate no strangers to Dillion's on Thunderbird for the Fridays fish fry and I always love it.  I don't understand why this restaurant doesn't have any of the same consistency's.  I have come to Plesant Harbor numerous of times and they all have been fails. I have never yelped bad before about Dillion's  because I thought that you guys were just having a bad day. Three times bad and I'm now going to share my bad experience.  Your food there is mediocre at best and I have to say you were not doing justice to any of the other Dylan restaurants in the valley. For five of us three of which were children and ordered off of the children's menu and two adults my bill was $75 with no Alcohol ordered.  I guess really this is all our fault because I went to a barbecue place and didn't order barbecue. My Bad!  Last but not least you will see a yelp about a guy Praising Dillion's and telling people with kids to stop griping and that this is a sports bar and go to Chuck E Cheese. You will also see management reply to his Yelp praising  him for making these comments.  Well the way I see it Dillion's Bayou ,   I can guarantee you that most of your business and I would even say 90% of your patrons do not come to your establishment to watch sports. But I do see you praising a man who Yelped that you were a sports bar and for people who have children basically telling them they have no business having children at your establishment, Chuck E Cheese is where you feel we belong. I get your message loud and clear."}
{"text":"My experience at Dillon's was very unpleasant.  For starters the hostess that took my name Saturday night was vey unfriendly, I figured well it's Saturday night, it's busy she probably deals with a bunch of drunk people from the lake, \"oh well\" I said to my self I'll let it go. When she finally called my name we went up to the hostess booth she looked at my party took some menus and started walking towards our table without saying a word to us.  Someone in my party said very politely \"so I guess we fallow her?\" When we finally arrived at our table she placed the menus on the table and again she never said one word. I was now starting to get a little annoyed.  Our waitress was mediocre again no smiles very blunt . After sitting down for about 30min I had to wave her down to place our order(really annoyed at this point).  After our food arrived another 30min of waiting the food was bland and mediocre just like the service. I won't be returning to this place even if I'm in the lake enjoying a sunny day I'd rather drive an hour to get better service and food. After reading other people's reviews I'm glad I didn't talk to the manager which seems to have the same I don't care attitude that goes around this restaurant."}
{"text":"Seemed like a unique / fun venue.  Alas,After being seated, had no service for 20 min when we found waiter & asked for drinks.  Appetizers came when our meal was 1/2 done even though we had ordered them with drinks.  Burnt tips tough & dry.  One in our party of 4 had wrong sides with meal .   Best food item was brisket sandwich.  Service was nonexistent.    Drinks never renewed.   Far from enjoyable!"}
{"text":"You visit for the location not the food."}
{"text":"Dillion's is a casual restaurant with a really fun vibe so if you're looking for a really kickback place for a couple drinks, football, or bar food, Dillion's is perfect. It's cool sitting in the patio on the water and it's dog friendly.  The parking is semi-far (up a hill and ramp) but they do have shuttles that can pick up/drop off (sidenote- shuttles are free but they accept cash tips). You'll also have to pay for parking to get into the lot ($6 for a day pass for cars).   I'm not a huge fan of the food because I don't eat meat but my husband and family enjoy the burgers and bar-style comfort food.  Vegetarians will have a hard time finding multiple options but the meat eaters will bask in the entree options.   The servers have always been friendly but service tends to be a little slow so I recommend not going if you're in a hurry. You may also have to wait 30-60 minutes for a table during dinner/summer."}
{"text":"Really fun. Great food, great service! Our waitress Chase was awesome. She helped us decide what to pick off the menu and was right on! The manager,TJ (I think was his name) stopped by to check on us and was really nice. Live music was cool too. Will come back for sure and bring friends!"}
{"text":"We had no idea they had moved from the county park over to Pleasant Harbor Marina so we had a little visit at the county park first then went over to the Marina. By the time we got to the marina it was dark so I don't have great pictures. But the new location is great! You will have to pay to park and pay for the \"shuttle\" to the restaurant on the dock, but the experience and the food is worth it! We happened to visit on a grand opening night so the place was packed and the wait was long for both a table and the shuttles afterwards, but overall it was a great experience. We shared the catfish which was delicious and our table mates got the pulled pork BBQ - they loved theirs too. The atmosphere was so cool being so far out on a dock, with all glass windows. They had a live band which added to the cool atmosphere. The shuttles deserve a mention of their own as an original experience. The ramp to the dock is really long and the golf cart shuttles drive you out there for a tip. At one point they have to pass each other which is interesting. Overall a cool night out - I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I really hate to do this, but for the honest review, here it goes.  I actually completely forgot to write a review for this place. Maybe there's a reason for that lol. Our experience was soooooo whatever that I'd rather forget it even happened, but for the sake of management using this as a means to improve their restaurant, I will write about it.  Bad host service, minus ten stars. It was that annoying. Mediocre food, minus one star. Unappealing menu, minus one star. No first aid kit on site which is against the law for businesses, minus another star.  Such a bummer because they actually have a really great location. This place could easily get 4-5 star ratings with a better menu & a more professional staff.  When you sit down & get to check out the menu, it already looks just..... okay. When you receive the food, it is literally.... JUST okay. Nothing noteworthy. Can't really believe we drove out from Avondale to try it out.  Now the service... lol. Our server Jessica was actually really sweet. She was very friendly, welcoming, and took care of us. Not an issue. The host was the issue. I can't stand hosts that don't know how to do their job without offending people. We were a party of 8. Do not squeeze us into a table that would originally fit 6 people when there are 10-person tables that you sat families of 5 and 7 in. There were so many open tables available. And you're gonna sit us, a family of 8, in a 6-person table and throw in two other chairs and think we wouldn't notice when we sit down? There's no elbow room. There's no way our food would be served to us comfortably or even fit on our table. We were the only non-white people in here so maybe that's why she didn't think twice about accommodating us the first time around. After sitting for 5 minutes cramped in the table with my family, I got up & told the host that we were moving to another table because 8 people can not comfortably sit in a 6-person table. And she said \"okay.\" That is all. No apologies for cramming us into a tiny table or making us look like fools in the middle of the restaurant. This place has a bunch of teenage girl employees that don't care for what they're doing. Simply just to be somewhere and feel slightly useful although the restaurant would do much better without them and their terrible \"I don't care\" attitudes.  We had a freak accident with our 9 year old upon entrance. In short, our 9 year old's toe was jammed & her nail was scraped off upon entering the doors of the restaurant. Accidents happen. We get it, but employees were damn near useless for any help on first aid or locating one when we had a 9 year old dripping with blood. The restaurant had zero first aid available in the establishment itself which is very odd. One worker responded, \"we have bandaids.\" I thought to myself, \"the child's foot is dripping with blood, you think band aids are enough?!\" Lol. A worker (possibly a server) also followed it up with all the help they can offer by saying, \"You can go to the Marina office and ask for first aid.\" I'm thinking to myself, \"I've NEVER been to this lake/dock before. I don't know where the marina office is. Why don't you press a button on your phone/walkie talkie, call them and request first aid to come to the restaurant since your establishment doesn't have any????\" I was pissed, but didn't bother responding because clearly, if I didn't get moving and looking for the marina office, nothing would have been done to help our kid in a timely manner. Anyway, businesses BY LAW must have first aid kits on site WITHIN their establishment in case of any emergencies. I had to scramble SEARCHING for the Marina office because none of the employees, especially the very busy hosts standing around, couldn't do it themselves or simply pick up a finger to call them.  The Marina office & the first aid that came to the restaurant were both great. Fast, efficient & communicated well. They acted with urgency & handled the situation the way it should have been. Joe was our first aid. A+!!!! Thank you again!!!!! Awesome people that know how to do their job!!!!  The managers of the restaurant were apologetic of the accident that happened to our 9 year old. They offered our family two free appetizers and a free meal & dessert for our 9 year old.  Aside from the accident we had, looking at the restaurant as a whole, in terms of service, food, and staff here, I am entirely unimpressed.  IN CONCLUSION: - not worth the trouble - mediocre food - unprofessional staff (in the restaurant) although our server & the managers were friendly"}
{"text":"Food is one step above fast food. Service done by 18 year olds that have no clue about customer service. Avoid giving them your money."}
{"text":"Disappointed with service twice. We thought we give it a second shot, but wasn't any better. Our waitress was just blah, not very good. She took long to come by & was not friendly at all like the waitress helping family in front table or behind us. We noticed the difference right away. Not to mention I was charged $30 for two small cocktails. When I asked about it they said I was being charged individually per shot & that the pineapple apple was free! Really! Never going back!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink etc. Too bad there is no parking for us boaters.  Apparently they just want land dwellers.  Very disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We were at this bar at the marina tonight and a drunk guy grabbed one of my employees ass and I went up to the bartender and let her know hey this guy is grabbing other guys asses and she said she would take care of it about fifteen minuets went buy and the guy does it again so I went up to the security guy who had just talked to the guy and said hey this guy just grabbed my employees ass again and he said OK I will take care of it then he goes over to the guy and tells him that guy over the is mad that you keeps grabbing his employees ass and the guy turns around and flips me off at which time I head on over to take care of business and they tell me and my guys that we need to leave and are not welcome in their bar. Now I'm not positive but I am pretty sure that if a man were to grab and fondle a woman once in a night and she felt violated that man would be arrested but according to this establishment it is OK for men to grope other men and the man being violated will be asked to leave. What happened to America people? Why is it OK for funny men to be accepted in this world but they are allowed to violate straight men? This seams a little out of place. We will no longer frequent lake pleasant this place is full of rude employees. Beware unless you are funny and not in a haha way."}
{"text":"Went here on St. Patty's Day this past weekend and went during the middle of the afternoon to avoid the night time drinking crowd. Arrived and we were seated out on the deck next to the water which is the reason we came out that day. We were offered the reuben sandwich special for the day that when verbally communicated sounded wonderful. When the so-called Reuben sandwiches arrived we found some sort of undescribable meat put between two pieces of white bread that weren't even properly toasted with a very odd colored sauerkraut and what they said was thousand island dressing mixed in with a very little bit of cheese. This and the small, insignificant side of potato salad that I was served with absolutely a complete rip-off for the 11 + dollar price that they were promoting this under. My 8 year old could put together a better sandwich than this that had been presented to me. Come on Dillons, food quality is important especially when you're offering it as your feature menu item on a holiday this is insulting to all of your customers! Views and ambiance aside, I'd rather pack my own picnic basket and sit out on the shore then take the short boat ride over to your location pay out the Wazoo for food that looks and tasted like it was prepared by a two year old.   No thanks! And the addition of a water slide isn't going to improve your food quality and draw people in, maybe you should have spent that money on training your staff or hiring better qualified Cooks."}
{"text":"This place has great food and a nice big bar area. It's located on Lake Pleasant and when you park in the parking lot golf carts will drive you down to the lake and  to the area where you can get to Dillon's KC BBQ. Nice dock to sit out and have a nice drink on a warm day. You can even jump in the lake right outside the front door. This place is very relaxing and fun. A must go if you live near by!!"}
{"text":"Food and service were very good considering how busy it was and the staff was very friendly. We had burgers and potato salad, both were excellent. In nicer weather two sides have garage doors to let the night in, should be fun.  They had a live band playing and it made you feel like you were somewhere on vacation, people were really enjoying themselves.  Mostly a \"over 30\" crowd on the Saturday night we were there.  It costs $6 to get into the park and park, then you take a shuttle from the parking lot to the restaurant for a tip or you can make the hike, either way it adds to the experience.  I can't wait for friends from out east to visit so I can take them there and it's less than a half hour drive from home.  Defiantly will be one of my favorite places to go this summer."}
{"text":"Was with a group of 8 people. 6 people got their food within 10 minutes. My friend and I got our food(a quesadilla and taco salad) -an hour after everyone else in our group was done eating. They said we will take care of you... Us right, $9 taken off our meal is not taking care of us... Food was just in by the time they brought it out. Dillon's is the only option out on lake pleasant but I would rather drive 30 minutes to get food outside of lake pleasant to ever eat at or grab a drink at Dillon's again!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I hadn't been to Lake Pleasant in  years and didn't remember any restaurants so I was pleasantly surprised when I went there to listen to Direct Connection band. The band was great. The sound was good. The food drinks & staff were great. It was really fun and there were people of all ages dancing, eating & having a good time. It's a bit of an adventure getting to the restaurant as it sits on the docks in the marina and you take a golf cart shuttle from the parking lot or you walk. It was beautiful scenery. Definitely an oasis in the desert. I will be going back- lots of fun!"}
{"text":"Yeah you have to pay to get in and park and yeah you have to take a golf cart down unless you want to walk and yeah the common courtesy is to tip the driver (not rocket science). You don't have to. Tips are appreciated. Normal humans tip though. Anyway. Until the walkway is fixed you have to take the Pontoon over. We always go before sunset so we can enjoy the gorgeous sunset over the lake. The restaurant is what it is. If you want some romantic, quiet eating experience go to Scottsdale or downtown. This is still technically a bar on the water with a restaurant name haha. The water seating is nice and the service is pretty slow. But again, you are at a lake where the pace is slower and more casual. The smoked pulled chicken is good and so is the pulled pork. We've had the burgers and onion rings, the artichoke dip. It has all tasted great so far. I enjoy going here. If you are in a hurry go somewhere else. If you don't want to pay to get in, go somewhere else. To me it's cheaper than tipping a valet to park my car so I can eat at some swanky restaurant, so the concept works."}
{"text":"Great place to have great food & service staff is always accomidating & awesome , they have great  bands on weekends ! They are my lake family thank you Jennifer & Mary & everyone else for taking care of us !"}
{"text":"If I could give ZERO stars I would.  Overpriced drinks in plastic cups.  2.5 hour wait after being sat inside after SPECIFICALLY asking for outside.  Kids meal asked for with appetizers, came AFTER all entrees to a very ANGRY child.  Coupon items and promised credits not on bill.  Dirty plates dropped all over someone at our table.  TERRIBLE. ABSOLUTE worst dining experience you could imagine.  Never going back.  Hope it sinks!"}
{"text":"Dillon's on Lake Pleasant is an absolute blast! My husband and I frequently stop in there for dinner and drinks. You are literally in the middle of a lake! It's fun getting there because you get to take a golf cart ride down to the lake! That being said, you will have to pay $5 to enter the marina to get to Dillon's but I think it's totally with it.  Everything we have tried there has been pretty good.  I had the Guinness battered cod and it was delicious. My husband had the chili dog which he said was just ok. The brisket though, it's absolutely amazing. The sauces they offer are very good.  They often times have bands on the weekends which have always been great. The service can tend to be a bit slow because it gets so busy but if you're not in a rush it's not a big deal.  Lines can also get long at the golf cart line to get back to your vehicle but it's fun chatting with everyone!"}
{"text":"My husband suggested going to Dillon's new spot that they bought and re-constructed from a previous restaurant and we were up to trying it out. What I didn't expect for it to be like a vacation for adults for a day and night! Heads up you will find half naked women in bikini's because of the boaters that stop off to eat, etc. This is not really an environment for children (Just saying). The day we went there was a live band going on that night. We had a 2 hour wait but had a couple drinks found some people to talk to on the front patio area and had a blast. Never thought I would say waiting was fun but it was. Once we were actually seated and got our food the band started playing when the sun went down. They played awesome 80's 90's music my teenage daughter offered to dance with me to a Journey song, I never had so much fun in my life it seems lol. Anyways making this my go to spot for special occasions. Kudo's Dillon's on the Bayou, you guys rocked this spot. Please keep up the great service and stay around for awhile."}
{"text":"Other than having to pay $6 to get into the park and the long wait for a golf cart ride to the dock, everything about our visit to Dillon's was good.  Our pulled pork sandwiches and wings were served hot and our cocktails were served cold.  I wish they had more outdoor seating or would leave the windows open to make you feel like you're on a lake.   I prefer the Dillon's at the Wildlife Zoo Park over this location, but he food was still very good!"}
{"text":"The food was ok, not horrible, kind of like your  typical bar food. The service was beyond sad and what promoted my reviews both on face book and yelp. We are from colorado and decided to go to Dillons because it looked like a fun day outing. We where constantly ignored and had to ask for everything multiple times, i.e. more drinks, an extra plate for my Grandmother, our sides that where supposed to come with the meal, our ticket ect. The place was not busy enough to remotely justify the slack of the employees. I set there watching my servers stand around and talk to one another.   I tried to talk to the manager who didn't seem to be at all concerned with our dissatisfaction. His response was a casual \"oops I am sorry for that\".  This is the only time I have ever felt the need to wright a negative review or speek to management about a restaurant. I have read multiple bad reviews with similar experiences and all I can do is hope Dillons can do some work within to correct there bad service/management  problems at this location..."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed at $6 entry fee to access This Lake Pleasant eatery.  They must not want \"outside\" customers, only the boating crowd!  Don't waste the trip"}
{"text":"I stopped going to the Pleasant Harbor Marina a long time ago for two reasons:  Scorpion Bay had slightly cheaper rental boats that were in significantly better condition, and Scorpion Bay had Dillons.     Having originally patronized the location on Central Ave in Phoenix before it closed, I love me some Dillons BBQ!   That Red Devil BBQ Sandwich was not-to-be-missed if you like a little something different.    In May, my wife and I went to Pleasant Harbor to get some sun because a friend now keeps his houseboat there.  Much to our surprise and pleasure, there's Dillon's!   They've moved to Pleasant Harbor!  We immediately decided that we were having BBQ for dinner that night before heading back to Phoenix.    I will start with the good:  My Red Devil Sandwich, and the cheesecake is pretty good.  Beyond this, unfortunately, our experience was anything but good, so much so that our friends who keep their boat at Pleasant Harbor actually apologized to us after we all left Dillon's.      The place was virtually empty at a bit after 5pm.   We were quickly sat, but it took quite a while, perhaps 10 or 15 minutes for a server to get to the four of us.  We ordered a drinks, a starter, and our meals at the same time  My wife's glass of wine came out, while this might seem picky, it was in a plastic cup.  We sat inside, so it was tough to understand why it wasn't served in glass.  Then our meals showed up without our starter.  Suddenly, the person (a boy) who delivered the food dumps my wife's giant cup of ice water all over her, her phone, her purse. Her wine cup got dumped as well.  Maybe it was foresight that led to the wine being served in a plastic cup?  Instead of jumping to action, he just stands there staring at us.  We throw our towels at it and quickly get up and change tables, as there's water everywhere.  We take our plates with us.  Our server starts drying the wet table and then goes into damage control mode but, frankly, it came across as her trying to get my wife to say \"my phone is working right now\" so that in the event it was not working later, the server could claim that we admitted it was working fine while we were still at the restaurant.  Of course, my wife's lap and legs are soaked, nobody offered to bring her any towels.   She subsequently found her meal to be dry and cold once she got to it, and felt like it had a consistency akin to having been heated in a microwave before it was served to her.     A few minutes later, a young man purporting to be a manager comes over to the table and mumbles something unintelligible to the four of us while we're eating.   All of us looked up at one another, and then looked at him and said something to the effect of \"excuse me?\".  He repeats something like \"are you OK?\".  I don't remember what my wife said to him but he left.  A few minutes later our server comes back over with our starter, and a missing salad and someone's side dish that had not been delivered with the rest of the meal.  She goes on to make excuses for the guy who knocked over the water.   Look, we get it, accidents happen but what it comes down to is apologies and a good attitude afterwards and we didn't feel we got that.   When we receive the bill, everything is on it.  Normally we would never do this but we were so surprised that there was not even an attempt made to satiate us by removing something (anything!) from the bill that my wife flat out said \"my meal needs to come off the bill\", then our friends said, \"you probably should bring us desert too\".  And guess what, my wife's meal came off the bill and we all got a comped slice of cheesecake to-go since the restaurant was already closed at that point.  The final encounter -- I got up to go ask our server for something -- either related to the bill or a box for something, I don't remember, but I do remember that she was rolling silverware and there were maybe 5 guys hanging around her.  As I approached they all went totally silent and gave me the evil eye.   It was as if I had personally done something to wrong them all, and they were all gossiping about it.   This was just such a totally comical way to end the experience, I could not help but chuckle and share the comments here.     Sorry Yelpers for the long review.  Thanks Dillon's for the reliable Red Devil sandwich and the free cheesecake.   I wish your location on Central was still open and I hope you improve the customer experience at Pleasant Harbor.  You're not new at the restaurant business, so I hope you'll take action to do just that."}
{"text":"HUGE SURPRISE! We used to come to the restaurant when it was under a different name and different ownership and vowed never to return because the service was so horrible. The service today was way better and our server (Kylie) was incredibly friendly and made sure that we had everything that we needed from the minute we got here! The menu is simple, the food is really good and the service was excellent! SO HAPPY YOU'RE HERE DILLONS!"}
{"text":"BBQ is ok-not great but certainly not bad.  5 stars for the staff though.  Been here several times and each time the staff is over the top friendly.  Neat place great views and good food...and the beer is cold!"}
{"text":"Nice lakeside atmosphere, great people watching. BBQ should stand on its own, regardless of sauce. Had two meat platter with pulled pork, burnt ends, beans and broccoli. Beans good. Broccoli good. Pulled pork tasted like it was finely shredded last week and warm up to a nice dry tasteless texture. Burnt ends tasted like stewed pot roast. Not a place to come eat bbq."}
{"text":"My family and I have been patrons of Dillons for the last 6 years.  We stay at the RV park regularly during the summer and take advantage of docking and eating at the restaurant when we stay.  It's a very cool vibe for Arizona as there are limited dining options on the water.  Sadly because of this, Dillon's doesn't try to improve their service or product.  Over the years the service has always been slow but we are never really in a rush so no big deal.  The food tends to be hit or miss depending on who is in the kitchen.  However two weeks ago was the last straw for us.    My husband was dining with friends and received the worst service to date.  First the waiter came out and forgot drinks for some at the table....and then never came back with the rest.  Everyone's food came out with the exception of one person and finally everyone just had to eat as the food was getting cold.  Once everyone was finished his food arrived.  They asked to speak to the manager and explained the situation.  The so called manager was extremely rude and only offered to not charge for the meal if he didn't eat it.  This person lives at the RV park full time and dines frequently at Dillon's.  I couldn't believe that no offer to make things right was offered.  If you have a boat....enjoy the cruise to Scorpion Bay where the service is friendly and the food is good."}
{"text":"I'm at the lake all the time and this place is awesome for lunch or dinner or a few drinks, if you want to hang out by the water I highly recommend Dillons!!!"}
{"text":"Had a delightful lunch today at Dillons after an equally delightful Lake Pleasant Cruise.  I always count on enjoying the brisket sandwich at Dillons (always at their Thunderbird location) and today was no exception.  Their civilized restrooms were a pleasant surprise and very much appreciated/  Have only seen full size doors in Europe.  Nice going Dillons.  Not exactly a surprise but I must mention  our delightful server, Jordan.  So pleasant, so efficient and not at all bothered that we asked for separate checks and take home containers.  All the way around a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"So I go to Dillion's often but this is my first time at this location. Came here for my son's birthday. It is definitely more lively, and more casual. Today I guess was Safari or some kind of theme all the waiters and waitresses were dressed like different animals which I thought was pretty cool. They were having a live band AZ DC, didn't stay to see them perform but you can tell it was going to be a full house! The inside of this restaurant is a little crowded but yet clean, and the staff seem to hustle and stay on top of things. The restrooms were each individual restrooms within a restroom with its own sink toilet etc which I liked but the did need attention but I imagine with this much traffic it's hard to maintain. Our waitress was very nice and helpful... the food came hot fresh and correct which of course is a plus! Currently the walk way to this is under construction so you take a boat to get to the restaurant which is cool for those who like boat rides lol I'm not such a fan but I will do anything for my son and it's what he wanted. I do want to come back and do the boat tour which is next door to Dillion's, yes I just said I don't like boat rides but again my son and my hubs want to go and anything for them...I'd recommend it for sure! Check in and get free onion rings!"}
{"text":"Dillons has delicious food, great entertainment every time we've been in on weekends and holidays. The place is and always seems to be extremely packed so the wait may be longer than appropriate. Not a bad thing but not a good thing either. Also, we have never had bad service. The restaurant is busy and popular but service has never been compromised!"}
{"text":"Today we visited Dillons on Lake Pleasant and our server Jay was amazing! He told us they were having a pirate party and he was dressed to impress! I wish more people shared the enthusiasm that Jay had! I hope Dillons realizes what a great employee they have'! Keep up the great work Jay!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun hangout place after a day on the lake, or for a casual bbq dinner. Very classy to offer a live band. Bring your boatful of friends and get down!!!"}
{"text":"What a mess! We drove an hour from Ahwatukee after getting an email ad from Dillon's showing a nice restaurant on the lake. We enjoyed Dillon's on Central before it closed, and also enjoy the one at the zoo, so we thought it would be a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon. But, the marina has made it next to impossible to even get close to Dillon's.  We were surprised to find a gate, where we had to pay $6 for parking and were then directed to a shuttle lot. We played along, figuring it must be a system that works, but boy were we wrong. We parked, unloaded the kids, and went to wait under the blue canopy as instructed. Instead of a shuttle, a big golf cart pulls up and is rushed by the people who have accumulated in no order under the blue canopy. There are no instructions for how or where to line up, and the shuttle driver takes people based on the room in the golf cart. The golf cart comes once ever 15 minutes or so, and there are large groups parking and waiting under the canopy. After a half hour standing in the parking lot with three kids and having people arrive after us and board before us, we gave up and left.   Absolutely ridiculous. This system cannot make sense to any rational human being. Instead of random seating in the form of picnic tables and benches, give people a clue that they should line up. It should have made sense to anyone arriving that all the people under the canopy were waiting for the shuttle, but apparently not. It was a free for all.   Is it not more practical to have one person in each vehicle drop their group off at Dillon's and then park in the parking lot and take the shuttle back to the restaurant?! Then, you only have one person from each vehicle trying to board the golf cart instead of five and six people from each vehicle. Really, there just doesn't seem to be any thought given to this at all."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first (and last) time Sunday (06/05/2016) afternoon.    Friends of ours were going out to Dillon's Bayou for a late lunch and invited us to come along.  We told them we'd meet them out there because we like Dillon's BBQ, and had not been to the Lake Pleasant location.  To start with, my 2 star review is for the location of the restaurant and the hassle of getting to it.  Be forewarned, there is a $6 entrance fee to the marina (even if you are just going there to eat at Dillon's).  After paying the entry fee, drive towards the blue canopy, park, and wait for a shuttle (6 seater golf cart).    When you get on the cart; hang on, because the stop signs there are NOT for the carts, just the cars and trucks of the customers.  I found this out when we left; because unlike the golf cart driver, I stop at stop signs.  If I hadn't stopped, I would have wiped out a group of customers, whose driver doesn't think that stop signs apply to him.  There is also a bucket on the golf cart and a sign that says \"tips are appreciated\", your tip is back at the entrance, where I just payed $6 to park my vehicle.   It's about a 5 minute ride down to the restaurant, past the boat ramps, and along a cause way/floating bridge to the restaurant and store area.  About the restaurant...  When we entered the restaurant, we asked if they comp the parking or give you a credit on the bill, no such luck...  The place has the feel of a bar/club (not a bad thing at all, and in nice weather would probably be a lot of fun if you have a boat docked out there, or come out to go boating).  Several Yelpers mention the views and the fact that the restaurant is on the water.  The views are nothing to write home about...We were seated behind the hostess station, about 50 feet straight in from the entrance looking north.  From this viewpoint, you can look at some covered boat slips, the floating bridge, or part of the bay with a model of a pirate ship.  If you look just right, you can see a small view of the rest of the lake.  Maybe I've been lucky, but I have eaten at many restaurants with views of a lake when I was growing up in upstate New York; so to me, this view is not worth the $6 parking fee, or the wild ride and exhaust fumes of a golf cart to eat here.  Maybe there are different areas that I didn't see where there is a spectacular view; pity, I won't be back to find that out.  About the food...  Junior had a cheeseburger and fries (the usual...), it looked good, if a little to well done; but he was happy with it.  The fries are the standard Dillon's steak fries, and while not just out of the fryer, they were tasty and somewhat crisp.    A side note about the burgers...I overheard our server telling our friends that the burgers all come medium well.  I don't care if it's a bbq place or not; when a restaurant specializes in meats, you should be able to get a burger anywhere from still mooing to well vulcanized!  My wife had the chicken club sandwich (grilled), it was good sized; and she said it was good, had 2 long strips of bacon on it along with cheese and ham.  My wife also choose the steak fries and was happy with them.  I had the pulled pork sandwich w/ the sweet heat bbq sauce, and cole slaw for my side.  The sandwich had plenty of pulled pork on it, but it was a little dry.  Dillon's pre sauces their sandwich before you get it, and if I had remembered that, I would've asked for my sauce on the side.  The pulled pork was served on what to me was a potato roll, it was very fresh and very good with the pulled pork.  About the bbq sauce, our server was kind enough to warn me that the sweet heat bbq sauce was very hot; I didn't really notice much heat, but the flavor was good; it was sweet, but not overly so.  I'd give the food a solid 3 stars.  As I have eaten at the other Dillon's (World Wildlife Zoo, Arrowhead, Thunderbird), I don't think it was quite up to Dillon's normal standards, but it was tasty and filled us up.  Our bill was $37 before tip, 3 sandwichs w/sides and 3 soft drinks.  Not too bad nowadays.  All in all, I wouldn't return.  The hassle of paying to park, the wait for the shuttle, the lack of a great view, and food that I can get at any of the other Dillon's  means it's just not worth it to me.  If you're a regular at the lake, I'd say give Dillon's a try, the food for the most part is solid, and it seems to be a nice place to kick back and re-charge after a day in the sun/water.  As for me, I'd rather go back to the one at World Wildlife Zoo and watch the sharks!"}
{"text":"It was good food and the waitress Kaitlyn was great. I can't say it wasn't the best I have ever eaten but it was good!"}
{"text":"It was fine. the food was fine, the service fine, the prices fine, the setting and staff fine. i have read the other reviews before we went. here's the thing, you are at a lake/marina in a high traffic area, 30 min from other services. i'm not expecting a five star experience. Dillons is what i would expect of a restaurant on a beach. ok, we had to wait 25 min for a table of 6...it's summer. the dessert came to our table before our entrees, ok, odd but not a catastrophe, just go with the flow. we had the staff remove extra plates from our table to make room, and then they brought over a new set which defeated the purpose, ok, laugh it off, go with the flow. the food was a little bland, but we all devoured it after a long day of hiking and swimming. the check came with our food, we werent asked if we wanted anything more, ok, just go with the flow. i dont want to pack in lunch or bring a cooler...i was satisfied with my meal and we would eat there again. and we are glad Dillons is at the lake. tip...next time we would order to go and then eat at one of their dockside tables. there was no outside service while we were there."}
{"text":"They've added more boat parking but still a huge problem.  Probably won't try again until next season."}
{"text":"Went out to Lake Pleasant just to see the lake and grab some lunch. I've never been to Dillion's before and if this is what all their locations are like food wise, I won't be back.  The service is just awful, however friendly they are, it's not good  at all.. I can't believe that they are on the water with not so great views and hardly any patio seating.   Let's talk about the food though. This is a BBQ place?? I had the turkey platter which said \"melts in your mouth\", I would hardly describe it as such. The \"homemade\" mac and cheese was not good. If that's homemade, you need a new recipe. The fries are boring, the food is boring. If you want to do good BBQ then step it up! Don't even think of getting the coleslaw if you're a coleslaw lover. It's not good. I'm from the south so I was pretty disappointed.    Here's the thing, you have a restaurant at the lake! Have some damn good eats to go with it! It's not that hard if you have a good chef/cook that pays attention to details  if you go here just for drinks that would be a better option. Skip the food and and pack your own food. No value and lack luster food."}
{"text":"The worst Dillon's BBQ period, first off they don't serve any ribs. Their service is terrible, the waitress that served us kept forgetting our orders & they served us cold entrees maybe good for kids but not for adults. This place is a hang out if you wanna drink & eat afterwards I'm sure lots of folks don't notice. Lol! If you want BBQ I would suggest you to migrate south & eat at one of the Dillon's locations in town."}
{"text":"Good BBQ (would recommend pulled chicken and pulled pork) but unless you're out boating there's no reason to drive out of your way to come here. $6 parking & the view isn't that great... Superrr casual joint. Service was pretty horrible but we've only been the once."}
{"text":"Sooo to start we asked to sit outside. They tried to put us inside. We waited over 2 hours to sit. The waitress forgot the kids food 3 times. The food was cold. Drinks are severally over priced. We checked in online and told the waitress they offered a free onion ring. Which she charged. Then because she forgot the kids meal 3 times she said she was going to comp it. She charged us. I understand it was a busy day but seriously!?!? Before all this drama I tried to order a drink at the bar and was ignored several times. I will never ever ever come back to this establishment. Keep the change!"}
{"text":"Stopped into the KC bbq today for lunch after our boat cruise.I would have to say I was a little let down. The food was okay, but not great. I ordered the burnt beef, with broccoli and cottage cheese . My meat was dry, but guess you should expect that, being they called it burnt. Also my broccoli was barely cooked, and sent it back to have it cooked longer, then it was edible .Our waitress was great , and the scenery was really enjoyable. So, I would say, try it, you might have a better meal than I did.  It's defiantly a unique setting, and no one else in our group had any complaints."}
{"text":"Zero stars if I could. Researched their website and facebook page prior to bringing family on New Years Day. No alternate hours were posted so we assumed business as usual. They even had a calendar posted which would have made it super easy to alert people of any changes for people coming all the way out that there are alternate hours. Make a big day of it only to be hugely disappointed at 4:15 that they closed at 4 pm. Why use social media if you don't update your info???????!! It's not like you are a business in town around the corner from multiple other places. We will never be back and opt for a picnic before we give these people money. We understand you do what is best for yourselves and your business but when you are a public entity, inform your patrons - its not hard. We will be spreading the word to all of our boater friends. The food is gross but was worth it for convenience and the novelty. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favorite places.  Use to be!!!!! The food quality has dropped considerably.  Chicken had no flavor.  Mac salad use to be the best.  Just noodles and mayo, found 1 carrot.  Then they have the nerve to ask for a tip when you use your credit card.  Ended up paying cash because they said I had to put a gratuity on it to proceed.  Really????  Where are the Hawaiian people that used to own the place.  Being from the Islands, it was a treat to go to L&L .  Now I'll do the drive to Leo's BBQ.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and while I am grateful to have the option to frequent a restaurant while camping/fishing at Lake Pleasant I would rather bring my own food. It is overpriced, the portions are small, and I don't want to sound like a turd but most of the staff I have encountered do not pay very close attention to what is going on. I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 only because it is fun to ride a boat up to dock and feels like an adventure trying to get to the restaurant. After that the experience is Meh."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service every time we come.  We love the menu and eat the burnt ends whenever they have them (which has been most times lately). We trailer our boat our to the lake and love that Dillons is at pleasant harbor!  I have never had a bad thing on the menu"}
{"text":"Went after day on Lake for appetizers and drinks, we got onion rings and spinach dip; think you would have to try hard to mess that up.  The beer was not Ice cold, and seemed a little dusty."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and was informed of this place by hotel staff. OMG. Was skeptical to spend $6 to enter but after fun golf cart and boat ride to the restaurant I was sold.   Fun was around every turn. The water slide is s hoot and they have games to boot. The store caters to the boaters and campers who were coming in en masse for the holiday weekend.   Only had the pretzels for food - very good. Mostly sat outside in shade and enjoyed beer while watching the water slide. Bring your bathing suit and courage!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Love this place. Great destination with lots of lake activities as well. Sailing lessons and rentals, kayaks and paddleboard rentals, tour boat etc. play and then grab some grub and a brew. Live music on the weekends."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Mary the bartender is great!!! We have been coming here since they opened and this is a must visit if you are at the lake."}
{"text":"I had turkey club and it was best I have ever had. We had a party of 11 and every person loved their meal! Wish I lived closer and could go more often!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at this location. The restaurant is situated on the waters of Lake Pleasant accessible only by using free boat shuttles with tip jars. The food was surprisingly same as their other locations. However, this location offers arcade, giant tables with oversized chess and checkers games. They also have full bar.  Scored free onion rings with Yelp check-in which was really fresh/hot and tasty. All the dishes we ordered were tasty. Large portions as well. Prices were friendly and service was attentive and prompt.  If you are out spending the day at Lake Pleasant, SUP (stand up paddle) or kayaking or boating, no need to pack food, just eat here. You'll be glad you did."}
