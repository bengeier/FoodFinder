{"text":"This is a good location for a coffee shoppe. They have an AWSOME name and there latte is great.  The service is nice and the people are friendly.  If your walking to donlands station definitely stop in for your coffee here."}
{"text":"No restrooms for paying customers to use? What?!? This is ridiculous seeing as coffee and tea are non-pharmaceutical diuretics. Sorry, I won't be returning. Great tea, but my pea-sized bladder simply won't stay the course!"}
{"text":"i was there on tuesday, great staff but unfortunately they don't care any gluten free or vegan sweets."}
{"text":"Very convenient location, right next to Donlands subway station. Only two buses operate there, and they aren't the most frequent ttc bus routes, so if you have a metropass, you can pop out and then pop back in! Small store, but very clean and friendly. Had the Nutella pastry and it was amazing!! Also had a mocha latte and found it to be the delicious! Definitely a nice local shop that gives the Starbucks a few mins walk away some competition."}
{"text":"Love the friendliness from the owners. They definitely know how to serve coffee and it tastes amazing! The shop is so inviting and is so convenient because of it's proximity to Donlands station. I love it here. I definitely recommend it for someone looking for a quiet neighbourhood coffee shop where you can just go, grab a drink and sit outside to enjoy the weather."}
{"text":"Disclosure: I have not yet tried the coffee here, so my review is based solely on the service, food and iced tea I had.

Been watching this space throughout the spring as they renovated. They opened just in time for me to pop in to avoid a heavy rainshower a few weeks ago.

As I had just had a coffee earlier that morning, I ordered a strawberry rose iced tea and braced myself for something kind of weird and artificial tasting but it was refreshing and delicious.

The coffee shop has a nice selection of little pastries unlike those offerings found elsewhere. I had the \"chocolate croissant\", which wasn't like a traditional croissant. Hard to describe it but it was smaller and denser with a cocoa-like chocolate woven into it. In any case it was a break from the usual and I thought it was very tasty. The owner also sent me home with a apricot pastry that I shared with my husband and we both thought was splendid. I also had a sample of an unusual biscotti from Montreal that had an almost nougat-like texture. Like I said, if you're looking for a little treat of something different this is the place.

Service was outstanding, though I admit I lucked out by arriving when it wasn't busy. I imagine given their proximity to Donlands station (next door) that the place gets pretty crazy busy during rush hour.

I'm definitely going to visit Marvel again soon. In fact, I think I'll stroll over there this morning and try out the coffee..."}
