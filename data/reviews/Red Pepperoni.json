{"text":"Supposed to be good pizza but never got waited on. Left when we got upset. Go to a place that wants your business."}
{"text":"Decent food, but nothing to wait too long for. Service is pitiful. I'll only come here if I'm really craving the beer or a calzone (because it's the only place in town to get one), but the ridiculous wait for service makes me want to walk out. 15 minutes to have my order taken when there are only 3 other couples here and at least 4 servers working is outrageous. The servers stood and stared at us while playing on their phones instead of taking our order. If you don't want to go to Hanover for good pizza then this place is a decent substitute, so long as you can handle the pitiful service."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing! We had the Sicilian and our kids had a cheese, which they said was the best they've ever had! Service was friendly and fast!! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I drive here about once a month during the summer. I love they have personal size pies and always hey great service."}
{"text":"I'm surprised no one has mentioned the lasagna!   2 words.... Life changing. It is the only place we order lasagna at.  The RPD pizza is also delicious.  The waitresses are always friendly, and the place is clean.  This is one of our \"go to\" establishments in Madison."}
{"text":"What a great find.  We got into Madison too early to check into Cliffty Falls Inn and had lunch here.  Food was great, service was great, cute place.  We had a full restaurant at the Inn (where food was not the greatest) and Friday night passed up the buffet at the Inn and ordered Pizza from here, and it was just as good at lunch the day before.  Will be a stop anytime we get to Madison, wish there was one in Goshen."}
{"text":"Had great time there and while you are waiting they have sports being played. Even when it was a full house we got our food relatively quick. The breadsticks were good and the pizza was amazing, especially the crust. If you are ever in Madison go to here."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch before visiting Clifty Falls. The selection of specialty pizzas was outstanding, had a problem deciding. The pizza was hot and fresh and had great flavor. I will certainly be returning for the pizza."}
{"text":"Service was horrid we came in and waited over 30 mins and never had drinks or the order taken"}
{"text":"Tim and I live right next-door to the Red Pepperoni, so we like to consider ourselves experts. We love their pizza, appetizers, and their beer selection. We are sad that they don't offer 6-packs-to-go, but we've never had a bad experience here.  I love trying a new beer each time we come in because their selection is so vast! And always served with a nicely chilled glass."}
{"text":"Staying at the Clifty Falls Inn and wanted something decent / quick after a long day hiking.  Popped in to get takeout, while waiting chatted with the staff and enjoyed one of the many beers they have.  When the pizza came all I can say is 'top notch'!  I will certainly be eating here again"}
{"text":"This small town pizza place would still be a favorite in a big city with infinite options. The owner has done the homework and nailed it in all areas; great family friendly atmosphere, delicious New York Style Pizza and an excellent local craft beer selection. The staff are friendly, appropriately attentive and professional.  Never a bad experience and always satisfied. I guarantee that when you leave, you'll already be thinking about coming back again soon!  Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"I arrived at 6:15pm and it took a considerable amount of time to just be seated. I ordered  the 6\" Macdaddy and it was delivered piping hot. It was quite tasty. If you are not in a hurry, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic spot for family pizza night!  The extensive beer list with descriptions was impressive.  The breadsticks arrived super hot and fluffy.  Everyone loved the garlic dipping sauce.  We split a large pizza...which fed 2 adults and 2 teens.  The White Pizza was so flavorful.  Our son wanted the Spuds McKenzie, so that was our other 1/2.  It was a HIT!!!  My husband said it didn't really taste like pizza...more like bar food.  I thought it tasted like bar food ON pizza.  How awesome is that!?!  Overall a very positive experience.  We will be back during our next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"First time in Madison, this place didn't exist... Now it's almost a family tradition. My in-laws are from Madison, I'm not, so when we decide to go out as a family (7 people), we end up at the red pepperoni, good food comma kind of small, but worth the price. The chicken bacon ranch (CBR) maybe the best pizza I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a lot of pizza.    Downtown Madison is great in the summer 2 patio tables are a must if you can.  The owner couldn't be a nicer guy, and the rest of the family. In fact, they worked out a deal for my wedding, since we catered the food through the red pepper, they would bring pizza after all the drinks at the end of the reception, a perfect ending to the night.  Everyone loved the pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!  They have great speciality pizzas but you also have the option to be creative too. They have the best craft beer selection around so enjoy while you wait for your delicious handmade pizza."}
{"text":"I've never had better pizza. Came through for a graduation looking for a quick bite to eat. Service was quick, pizza was crunchy, very flavorful, and delicious. I'd definitely come here again if I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"Holy beer selection! They had a ton of great Micro-Brews that I have never heard of. There was local stuff and other big name stuff as well!   I went here on a lacrosse trip to Hanover College that I was coaching. We stopped here to get some pasta for the team. The manager that was working was awesome. He was very accommodating on our take out menu and cut us a deal since we were spending close to $400 for 32 people.   The pasta and the sauce was very good and all of the players were huge fans! The meat balls were larger than normal size which was nice.   If you are in the area, check it out. Very quaint and family focused place."}
{"text":"Loved it!!  Stopped here with the family on a day trip to Hanover College and Clifty.  We loved the toasted ravioli and breadsticks.  Specialty pizza was great - quick service, reasonably priced, and delicious!  Will be back..."}
{"text":"We stopped at The Red Pepperoni on our last trip to Madison.  It will not be our last visit.  The breadsticks are alone are worth trip.  The waitress was attentive and very nice.  I would highly recommend this place if you are wanting pizza!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, fried ravioli, and cheese fries. Friendly service. Horrible dill ranch dressing!"}
{"text":"What to get: Spud Mackenzie pizza Service:4/5  BEST pizza in the city of Madison, IN. They don't just have the basic pizzas, they have so many combinations & toppings to choose from. My favorite is the Spud Mackenzie which has dill sauce, bacon, french fries, cheese, & scallions. They have very different & unique pizzas, which i love! Their salads are also very big & delicious. They have a variety of food which i think is great for a pizza restaurant. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Great fresh made pizza and sides along side  the best craft beer selection in Madison.  The atmosphere sets the whole dining experience off perfectly.  Servers are always prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"We are from outside of Chicago and we have the best pizza anywhere at our fingertips, so we were not expecting a whole lot. We are very happy to say that we were incorrect!!!!  It was fantastic pizza!  Service was good, as they were very busy with lots of customers.. Hubby and I had two salads with their home-made bleu cheese and dill ranch dressing. He said his was \"not bad\" and my dill ranch was very good.  In fact, I was told \"you aren't going to really take the leftover dressing home, are you\" and I said \"well, yes I am and if it disappears, then you know where the doghouse is.\" (I had ordered a second container). We ordered the small specialty RPD pizza (sausage, pepperoni, onion, green pepper) which was more than big enough for the two of us. It was Sunday night, so we could have gotten a large for almost the same price, but since we are a hotel, really had nowhere to store  the leftovers and knew we wouldn't be in the room to eat it.  One side salad could almost be shared by two people. It had a healthy does of banana peppers (LOVE those), mozzarella cheese and green olives (LOVE those too), along with some white onions. Did I mention the dressing??? So good!!!!  The pizza was a thin crust, but not crispy, with a healthy dose of toppings, just the right amount of cheese and sauce. It had good flavor and was baked perfectly.  We had leftover pieces after eating the huge salads.  The price was less than $25 and well worth it for what we received. Restaurant had good service, was clean and excellent pizza. We would definitely go back there when in town."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! Spent the day hiking at clifty Falls and stopped in for some lunch. The wait staff was super friendly and on their game. All the waitresses were attentive to all the tables and so service was just awesome! As for the food, they had daily specials and everything was fairly priced. I tried the white pizza. It was really good, I think I'll try another one next time. But honestly everything looks awesome. My friend got the Calazone and it was pretty big. She said it was great. So after a day of hiking stop by and grab a slice!"}
{"text":"I could have given it five stars, and maybe I should have. Inside didn't look really great, but we had such a nice outside table experience. The White pizza was rich and flavorful. Really nice selection of beers too. Our waiter, David, was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Every time we eat here the food is delicious. The fried ravioli as an appetizer is amazing and they always carry an awesome variety of beers! 6 foot blonde is my alk time favorite. Friendly small town casual atmosphere. They also have a few outside picnic tables."}
{"text":"Tasty Greek Pizza and Lasagna! Erv liked the blond Upland Wheat Ale with the orange slice. The side Caesar salad was very nice with lots of tomato bits, some onions. Many Indiana Brews available. Polite and helpful servers."}
{"text":"Only thing better than the service is this pizza... so good. Got the Spud Pizza, was very hesitant but son wanted it....no regrets!!"}
{"text":"Generally service is great and food is good, but it's annoying when the price The menu and the price on the check don't match. Usually to the restaurant's favor"}
{"text":"The students at the middle school were raving about this place so I decided to check it out. Definitely worth the trip. I had the white pizza - so good and breadsticks / so good and a hard cider. They have an impressive beer menu featuring a large selection of Indiana beer. The breadsticks are definitely worth mentioning twice because they weren't at all greasy. Nice and crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy inside. Not high cuisine but excellent for a pizza joint. The best part - the prices are super reasonable! I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I stopped in to this place recently for lunch and had the personal pan pizza and breadsticks and it was very good.   The staff was very nice and I would strongly recommend"}
{"text":"The best thing about our visit was the porch. I got a Stromboli that was missing ingredients and the sausage was cold. We also ordered a Buffalo Chicken sandwich hat was delivered without the buffalo sauce. Didn't seem like the kitchen was checking the orders before they are sending them out."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to eating here after seeing some of the reviews but it turned out to be just a so so pizza place."}
{"text":"We love going to this place after a day of hiking at Clifty Falls. They don't just serve sausage and pepperoni pizzas they have a wider variety of pizzas than most places. The Spud McKenzie has french fries on it! How many places can you say put french fries on their Pizza??  They have a really good buffalo chicken pizza too. I don't like Peppers but this one comes with green peppers and I can totally eat it it's so good. I've also had the ravioli which was really good. They also have sandwiches and the Italian sandwich is amazing. Probably one of the best Italian sandwiches I've had anywhere. The Italian sandwich is my go-to sandwich. So I've had quite one at quite a few different places. There's probably a total of 20 tables in this restaurant and normally there is three to four open tables at anytime. Not overly busy but they do get people in and out efficiently. They have a decent sized beer menu also. Quite a few different options. The walls are covered with beer signs. Most I've never even heard of. I highly recommend eating at the red pepperoni and walking down Main Street to all the shops and checking out lower Madison."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, really solid pizza, and a fantastic selection of beers.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great lil find while in Madison for a high school football game. Pizza had excellent flavor. Wings were great. Everything, from the dough to the salad dressings, all had a fresh homemade and unique taste! Service was quick and attentive. We'll definitely be back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Just ate at this quaint little pizza spot in Historic Madison.  It was So Good!  Both of my picky eaters said it was the best pizza they have had and the best meal that we had on our mini-trip.  My husband and I really enjoyed it too.  Price was reasonable too.  I highly recommend a stop here if you get a chance."}
{"text":"Red Pepperoni is one of our favorite places to go in Madison. The service has always been quick and attentive, and everything we have tried tastes amazing and is a great value. We have tried several appetizers on the menu including the wings, breadsticks, and cheese bread and were pleased with all of these options. As for pizza, we usually get the pan crust and various toppings. This usually leaves enough food for both of us to have leftovers the next day. They also have an extensive beer list with options for everyone including ciders. If you find yourself in Madison for the afternoon or evening, I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"How is this not five stars across the board??   We loved the food, service and prices.   We started with the cheese break (very good), enjoyed salads and breadsticks (the dressings were delectable), and finished with calzones (amazing). All of that with soft drinks was under $35.  We frequent pizza places everywhere we go. Their crust was some of the best we have experienced. The marinara was also delicious.   Our server was very friendly and made sure that our drinks never were empty and our table was cleared off.   It's a small place so I could see it being very crowded in the evening."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  Service is always awesome and food is great!  My fave is the spinach artichoke dip. Does anyone have this recipe?  I have googled the hell out of it with no luck. I am dying to make it for my friends and family!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is very respectable but I didn't get a chance to evaluate it based on price. The menu is fairly diverse with several different kinds of specialty pizzas, salads, calzones and other items. The dining room was clean the staff was attentive and polite. The foot, itself, was alright though I felt the crust was a little on the thin side but that's more of a matter of preference. My wife tried the french fry pizza while I opted for the buffalo chicken and the kids had plain cheese. The french fry pizza was a little underwhelming, cheese was on par and I thought that the buffalo was pretty good but a little on the mild side. The breadsticks were large, puffy and delicious."}
{"text":"I came here with my nephews and we all loved it. The pizza was perfectly cooked, and tasted delicious. The bread sticks were fluffy, which I thought was excellent. The best part was that for five of us to eat, it cost $26. I couldn't believe it. The wait staff were also extremely friendly. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with options different then your traditional pizza place but Buffalo chicken is my favorite locally owned great service ! Beer and ale selection is spot on and they support local brewery's!"}
{"text":"Ate here twice over an extra long weekend as it was one  of our favorites. Thanks to Yelp nation for the steerage!  I'm certainly going to echo several sentiments with my synopsis.  Clean? Yep. Popular? Seems to be.  We had pizzas, boneless wings, breadsticks, and toasted ravioli.  Pizza: both times served quickly from a busy kitchen & delicious Toasted Ravioli: tasty Boneless wings: wanted regular but N/A, boneless were good though Breadsticks: perhaps the standout of the meals - excellent!  Very Strongly recommend the garlic dip!  Beer & Cider selection looked good.  You have to request that as a separate menu. Sadly, the first time, our server never revisited to take that  order until we had eaten our appetizers and all but the last  slice of pizza! Hard miss.  Wait service: spotty - as written quite a few times  elsewhere by others - they're right. Know that going in. I'm not going to belabor the point.  Value priced? Yes, and fairly.  Though we spent $20+ for the two of us, we were trying to cover the menu as best we could.  Would we return? Yes. Absolutely! But I may think twice if they're packed."}
{"text":"Now I know why the locals love this place.  We went on a Friday evening and it was packed.  People were obviously enjoying the food and each other's company.  We tried the side salads with their homemade dill ranch and Italian vinegret dressings - both excellent!  We ordered the Thai chicken pizza which was very tasty.  The place was busy and the waitresses hustled.  The bathrooms were very clean.  The prices were good.  Definitely give this place a try!!"}
{"text":"Nothing better than a small business with a great product!! Awesome sauce and crust! I look forward to enjoying again!!"}
{"text":"Okay so the homemade spinach artichoke dip appetizer is so amazing it almost doesn't make sense. We ordered their version of a meat lovers pizza and it was topping overload! The selection of craft beers rivals that of any restaurant we visit in Indy. Delta our waitress was super friendly and on the spot, even though they were smoking busy. Absolutely love this place!!!"}
{"text":"We love pizza so we are usually pretty critical of pizzerias, but we would definitely recommend TRP! Pizza and salad were both great!"}
{"text":"They had lots of choices on the menu and we decided to order the chicken wings and cheese bread.  The chicken is bone-in and large pieces and very reasonably priced.  It came out steaming hot and they let us have a ranch and blue cheese for dips.  All the food was tasty and hot.  Also, they have a very extensive list of beers.  The service was very friendly and the food came to us in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and the pizza was so tasty. The beer list is 3 pages typed front and back and is also beautifully displayed on a chalkboard at the entrance. I ordered the Noble Order Tobias Apricot IPA. Unfortunately I received the Original Sin Apricot Cider. Not at all the same thing, but I liked it fine once I adjusted to having a cider, and I didn't mention the mix up to our very busy waitress. My boyfriend ordered a New Albanian Hoptimus IPA, which came out in a 22 oz. bomber bottle, which was a surprise (but a good one.)  The toasted ravioli were tasty, six to an order and a perfect start. The small RPD pizza (minus green peppers) was the perfect amount. Without the ravioli we'd have eaten the whole thing!   I ordered a diet Pepsi when we ordered the pizza and literally I received the straw when we got the bill!! I didn't get the Pepsi until we asked for the check and I asked for it to go!! The poor waitresses here are stretched to the MAX. but they're so friendly. Definitely a great choice in Madison."}
{"text":"the calzones and personal pies are bomb. the larger ones aren't as good (mine were always wet), and are more expensive. avoid them and be rewarded for being greedy."}
{"text":"Sat down and waited about 20 min with no service. My husband went up to the register to ask if we needed to order there or wait at table, and they said they'd be with us in a moment. 20 more minutes later, still no service, no one has even come to our table not once. Had to go up again and once again ask for service. After 40 minutes, we finally got to order. Still incredibly slow service after ordering despite being here during a slower part of the day. All in all spent 1.5 hours here, almost all of it just waiting around. Pizza was good but nothing special or worth the 1.5 hours we spent here. If you want some real pizza, make the trek to louisville and hit up impellizeris or spinellis in the highlands.  Bummed about our experience here.   Positives though, the prices are pretty good and they have a good variety of pizza options as well as the build your own option. 8.25 lunch special which is plenty of food!"}
{"text":"This place is small.  Went on a Thursday and it was pretty packed so I'm assuming Fri, Sat will be more so.  So be prepared to wait on table....but it's worth the wait! The interior is kitschy with beer signs, neon lights, etc.  Speaking of beer, WHOA!  They have an enormously extensive beer list.  They have a lot written on a chalk board but it's hard to read.  They also have a beer bible that tells what they have.  I was satisfied with this Peach beer.  It didn't taste like peaches but it was a good beer nonetheless. On to the pizza....got the artichoke pizza and added chicken.  It was delicious!  The crust wasn't too thin or too thick.  The sauce was really creamy and satisfying.  If you are to order this pizza, stick with a personal pan or a small.  To me, the cream is so rich I couldn't eat more than two or three slices of it. The waitstaff was really on it too.  Our waitress was very pleasant and it seemed most of the staff were local school kids.  But they all seemed great and did their jobs well. Give this place a try!  The End."}
{"text":"I enjoy trying new restaurants, and this one has a nice outdoor and indoor seating. The staff is nice and quick to make sure you have what you want. I tried the personal ultimate veggie pizza, which I would recommend. A friend I was with tried one of there salad and liked it. Another person tried just a small mushroom and sausage pizza and really liked it."}
{"text":"This is probably the best pizza I have ever had. Barbecue chicken, buffalo chicken, and spinach artichoke are the only ones I've had and are all super good. The spinach artichoke dip and fried ravioli are amazing too. The prices are super reasonable and service is always fast. Perfect place to come after hiking around Clifty Falls!"}
{"text":"This was the first time that I had eaten here. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I ordered the Teriyaki chicken Pizza and it was good. I would've liked the crust to have been alittle thicker and the chicken chunks were just a bit big for a topping. But I may probably visit here again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last week with my 9-year-old seeking a decent pizza dinner. Red Pepperoni very capably met our needs.   We shared an order of toasted ravioli (which my son had never had before and LOVED), then a small pizza that proved more than enough for the two of us. Everything was tasty, hot and fresh. With two beers for me and a Sprite for him, our tab ran just over $20. VERY fair and more than reasonable prices for the amount and quality of food and drink we received.   The place isn't terribly fancy, but casually comfortable. It definitely seems to be \"the\" hometown favorite pizzeria in Madison. Service was quick and friendly. Would definitely come back again when in town."}
{"text":"Great pizza , cold beer, and the staff was prompt and friendly. A must stop in Madison Ind."}
{"text":"Try the Sicilian. It will change your life. These people love what they do and are passionate about great food and excellent service. I've been twice to sit down and about ten times for delivery and am always impressed. Salads and breadsticks are awesome too."}
