{"text":"I'm not planning on being overly elaborate in my praise, but this was seriously the best chinese food I have ever had. I wasn't even particularly in the mood for chinese, but my brother was in town and was craving some. This was the first time yelp played a role in my choice, and I am so glad I listened to the reviews. I'm pretty sure I have finally found the chinese place to go to in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout with groupon. I loved the mapo tofu - the spices were really well balanced and they give you a hefty amount. But, I wish that they used more pork. I also got the green beans which were a bit overcooked and a bit too greasy. I also thought that the entrees were pricey. I'd definitely go back to try more dishes, but only with another groupon."}
{"text":"This is my most favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. The location is a little far away from my office, but I still love to walk to there for good food. The service is very good too. I like Fish  fillet in hot broth the most. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Crispy chicken- a little on the dry side, the spice got to your throat
Beef chow mein- very good I would recommend this
They have large servings so I recommend bringing a large group and sharing!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!!!! And the service here is also very good! Last time I ate here with my friends, the environment is great and not crowded I guess maybe it's not the busy hour. Recommend here?"}
{"text":"Expectations greatly exceeded! I was visiting from New York and liked the look of this place (as well as its distinctly non-Americanized menu). I was really impressed by the quality of the meal, which is at the level of the best I've had in Manhattan's Chinatown. Tofu with cumin was lightly fried and flavorful, with just enough heat. The spicy lamb bowl was outstanding, with an intense Sichuan flavor and hints of a Mongolian sour bits (but beware--it's quite spicy). The decor is very simple but relaxed, and the staff is attentive and eager to please. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here one day to try out a new Chinese place in the area than our usual places. The place looks really nice inside and they have a pretty broad selection on their menu. My husband and I ordered off the American menu. I got the chicken and broccoli and my husband ordered general tso's. 

The food was delicious! The portions were just right and for the price you could save half your meal for lunch the next day.

The service is the only part of my issue with the restaurant. The waitress was very friendly and nice but not attentive. But it wasn't only her, other tables I could see were frustrated with their waitresses as well. Ours didn't refill our glasses of water, which I feel is pretty important, nor did she do the one time \"check in\" to see how the food was. She along with the other two waitresses were gone half the time and the restaurant wasn't even that packed with people.

If we were to eat here again, we would only get take out because we sat around for half an hour just waiting."}
{"text":"I ordered Green tea, but I got only milk, I guess. I'm not sure what kind of green tea they used but it doesn't look green nor have a taste of green tea at all."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!  Honestly, the best I've ever had, and so authentic.  Everything we had was absolutely amazing.  (Veggie lettuce wraps, bo-bo rabbit, black pepper fish filet, and beer flavored flaming duck).  We will definitely be back, this place is the real deal."}
{"text":"very spicy and tasty chinese food :)

friendly waiters who didn't seem to know the food !!!"}
{"text":"Today, the food was cold, apparently it was cooked before we order it. They just use microwave to heat it, but not thoroughly.

After three hours, my boyfriend and I feel stomachache. I will never go back to this restaurant !"}
{"text":"Very yummy.  I got to try a huge variety of dishes with a big group of friends who knew what they were ordering.  All dishes were great!  My favorites were Beef in Hot Broth, Shredded Pork w/Seasoned Tofu, Braised Pork Shoulder, Mao's Pork, and Double Cooked Pork Belly.  Off the appetizers, one of the Bean Jelly Noodles was delicious, and Honey Pork Ribs were also great.  I know I just listed a ton of dishes, because they were all awesome!

I'm actually not great at handling spicy foods, but everything was very flavorful with the right amount of spice for me, and I didn't have too many problems afterwards :).  Of course, you might want to steer clear if you have acid reflux, but they do have some good non-spicy dishes available, like the Braised Pork Shoulder & Honey Pork Ribs.

Finally, the prices may seem a little steep, but they offer many dishes in two sizes.  The larger one is HUGE and the smaller portion is fairly regular-sized.  The appetizers are pretty big as well.  They also put out a complimentary little plate of either fried wonton skins or Chinese style boiled peanuts for you to snack on before your meal.  Definitely recommend ordering family style and sharing dishes."}
{"text":"This is what my hometown flavor is! Very Authentic. I ordered the hot and sour yam noodles and spicy pork intestines. Both of them are pretty good and I'm so full after eating! In my opinion, this restaurant's food is in high quality and suitable price, but the vegetables is a little expensive, for example,the potatoes' price is as high as 9.99."}
{"text":"Food is fresh and excellent. Portions large enough for family style dining. Not the hottest schezuan cooking I've had but very good. Dining room is vibrant. Staff is pleasant and very eager to serve."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by accident on Yelp and had to try it. The food was delicious! We got our food quickly and the service was great. Their menu is very diverse and you can get actual Chinese courses if you prefer. I would definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this Chinese food after seeing how many reviews it had I decided to give it a try. I ordered take out General Tos chicken it was sour and soggy, the lo mein noodles where spaghetti noodles with no flavor, and the crab Rangoon was also very sour and not creamy. Additionally if I pay $11 for chicken, I would hope there would be more than 10 pieces. The service was great and I had a pleasant conversation with whomever checked me out but the food was sub par and I don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Don't know why. Their attitude goes worse and worse each time I visited. I remember when they were just opened, the attitude was fantastic. I guess there are only that many decent Chinese restaurants around the town, and they get to be arrogant and don't give a fuck. Oh well."}
{"text":"We had a delivery.  The food just wasn't good. We didn't like the seasoning and the taste of the dishes we regularly order every time when eating Chinese food anywhere else. Additionally I ordered a soup and got a big box of noodles but no broth . Just a container with a little bit of seasoned minced meat (tasted really good) . I called the restaurant to tell them they didn't send any broth and they told me that this is the dish. This definitely wasn't a soup.
Overall it was a disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh!
Recommendation : hotpot, boba tea, port intestine noodle"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Szechuan food, crispy chicken is delicious. Portion sizes are huge, I would recommend anyone to check this place out!"}
{"text":"The service was extremely fast, atmosphere was great. I did not like the Bok Choy with mushrooms like I thought I would. The ginger duck was really good though. 4.5 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out from this restaurant for the first time tonight, based on the good reviews on this website. I will not do so again. It took almost 2 hours and four separate calls for our food to arrive. More than $50.00 and a ruined evening later, the food finally came. IT WAS COLD AND GELATINOUS.  I want my money back."}
{"text":"As a student from Sichuan, I have to say that Sichuan Gourmet is a reeeaaaally good Chinese restaurant that provides authentic and delicious Sichuan cuisine - the taste is just the same as it is in Sichuan. Strongly recommended for those who want to have a taste of Sichuan."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Sichuan food, so I tend to love all Chinese restaurants that serve authentic Sichuan dishes. And I tend to be nice and give pretty good reviews in general because I know how hard the restaurant business can be. However, given that I had just tried How Lee the week before, China Star was a bit of a disappointment. We ordered off the Chinese menu and most of the food was just so-so. The tofu in the ma-po tofu was definitely spoiled and on it's way to being fermented tofu although I couldn't make a big deal about it because everyone had eaten it already. The spicy fish in chili oil was not nearly as good as How Lee's. Some people wanted to be adventurous and ordered the frog and a rabbit dish. The flavors were decent but it was all bones, and I've had plenty of meatier frog and rabbit before. 

The service was terrible, even for a Chinese restaurant. They got mad at us because 3 people cancelled last minute and we had 14 people instead of 17, and half the dishes were already eaten before everyone got even a glass of water. We asked for tea and they gave us TWO tea cups. The rest of the tea cups came with the dessert oranges....unbelievable. The first thing you should get at any Chinese restaurant is tea...and it wasn't even like we didn't speak Chinese...

On top of that, the party next door to us was getting wasted and they had people stumbling to the bathroom to puke. There was literally puke in the sink of BOTH the men's and the women's restroom and no one bothered to clean it up. Gross. 

Maybe some day I will be forced to come here again with a big group of people and maybe I'll have a better experience then, but this was a terrible first impression."}
{"text":"Love it, not an expert on this type of food but I loved the spicy cold noodle appetizer and 5 spicy beef. Wasn't very spicy but maybe they noticed I was the only white guy there and went easy on me. Service was fast even on Easter Sunday."}
{"text":"Arrived at about 1pm on the Wednesday. The place was empty, which should have tipped us off, but it was too cold to keep walking down Murray!

Our waitress was courteous, but not terribly attentive. We ran out of water more than once and getting our check took longer than it should have. Not that big of a deal, since we didn't really want to get back to work anyway. We did have some problems ordering as our waitress was initially confused when we asked to order from the main menu during lunch. The front of the dinner menus has a few blurbs about the lunch specials and salads that come free with dinner and deals that are available when dinner is ordered, but the waitress didn't know what any of it meant, so we never did figure that out.

We ordered off the dinner menu because the lunch menu lacked descriptions and looked pretty boring. We ordered scallion pancakes, cheese rangoons, a chicken dish w/ vegetables, and the braised tofu w/ vegetables. The cheese rangoons turned out to be crab rangoons, which was very disappointing to me, but my companion said they were okay. The scallion pancakes were also okay. The entrees we ordered were delicious. The tofu in my dish was great, the veggies were yummy too. The chicken dish was ordered very spicy and that is apparently exactly how to arrived. Not a fan of chickens myself, I had to take her word for it. The vegetables in the dish were not exactly what was in the description on the menu, but my friend had no complaints.  

Despite the slow service, I was all set to come back to this place and order that braised tofu again until I stopped by the restroom prior to leaving. It was just gross. Not the kind of gross that could maybe be explained by the last person being a pig. It was the kind of gross that comes from not being cleaned in a very long time. The sink looked pretty clean, but it also appeared to be one of the newer items in the room. There was grime on the walls, the floor was disgusting, it smelled bad, and the garbage can in the stall was the stuff of nightmares. When restaurants can't be bothered to scrub the bathroom every once and while, I'm left thinking they don't scrub the kitchen terribly often either. I swear I'm not a germ-o-phobe, but I will never go back."}
{"text":"Like chengdu la zi ji !   I probably added  more laziji  pics than anybody over here!"}
{"text":"My favorite eating place in Pittsburgh! Delicious and authentic Chinese Sichuan spicy food. Even comparable to most Chinese restaurants! We come and order online on a daily base.  They even provide gorgeous student lunch box to CMU every workday.  5 star recommend! And no matter what dish you order, it will bring you taste of real China and hometown. Love it."}
{"text":"This is the place to go to for real authentic Chinese food in Pittsburgh.  They do have two sections of the menu, one that is an Americanized one and the other a more authentic one.  I can't really comment on the American side, but I'm sure it's probably good.  But if you're reading this and planning on going chances are you're not going there for the General Tso's.  They have dishes such as  sauteed duck tongue, intestines, pork blood tofu, intestines and many other things.  It's quite an extensive menu. If you are daring enough to try it expect levels of heat and sensations that the American palate is not used to.  The Chongqing Chicken will create a unique sensation of burning and numbness that will make your mouth tingle with electric feeling.  It's very unique and we are very lucky to have a place like this here in da 'burg."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic sichaun food! Loved the flaming fish, eggplant appetizer, and the spicy fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Had to wait an hour for a simple order, with constant unfulfilled promises that it would \"just be five more minutes\". Won't be back."}
{"text":"Food: When you're seated at Sichuan, you're given two menus.  We weren't told the difference between them, but after asking, our waiter explained that one is \"American Chinese\" and the other is \"authentic Chinese.\"  This isn't written on either menu, so if you want to know the difference, ask.  Both menus are expansive and have similar items, and we ordered exclusively from the \"authentic Chinese\" menu.  There are countless appetizers, soups, common and uncommon varieties of meats and seafood, and vegetarian options.  We started with the Spring roll, which was more like a vegetarian egg roll with a fried crispy shell.  It wasn't bad, but very average, although it did come with a lot sauce for dipping.  We also ordered the Sichuan pickled vegetables, which didn't taste very pickled, but were spicy and tasty.  The portion was large, but they were extremely salty leaving us thirsty and needing water (which became a problem, see below).  We asked the waiter to recommend specific vegetarian items; we ordered one of his recommendations and experimented with another.  His recommendation was the baby bok choy and black mushrooms, which was exactly that with a subtle sauce and rice.  I asked for the meal to be made spicy (it wasn't listed as spicy), and the waiter offered mild, medium, or hot.  I chose medium, and the dish was somewhat spicy, but the sauce was fairly bland and a plate full of bok choy and mushrooms gets old fast.  We also ordered the Chinese eggplant, and requested tofu to be added, which carried an additional $3 charge.  The eggplant dish was considerably more tasty than the other, but without the tofu, it may have been similarly boring.  Nothing we ordered was bad, but the best dish was only slightly above average.  The menu may be better suited to adventurous carnivores due to the plethora of options, or someone craving authentic Chinese food.

Price: The prices are very reasonable, as our bill came to just over $30 for two appetizers and two entrees (even with the $3 tofu tax).  Appetizers range from $5-10 with entrees ranging from $8-25 and averaging around $14-15 (vegetarian entrees cheaper, as always).  They offer discounts to Pitt and CMU students and a 5% discount to all customers that pay with cash.

Drinks: Sichuan Gourmet does not have a bar, and there was no mention of BYOB.  We didn't see anyone drinking alcohol.

Atmosphere: The dining room is large with tables of all sizes and large windows facing Murray Ave.  The restaurant was packed while we were there on an early Friday evening, and it gets relatively loud as the tables are close together.  They are open relatively late, so if you leave the Squirrel Hill bars or the Manor before too late, you'll be able to get some affordable Chinese food as a nightcap.

Service: We were seated after a brief wait and our waiter provided menus and water immediately.  Unfortunately, it was the final time we would receive water the entire dinner.  He never replaced the water without prompting, and even after we asked (multiple times), we had empty cups and nothing to quench our thirst after eating salty, spicy food.  The waiter answered our menu questions to some extent, but the host, waiter, and another employee had a very difficult time understanding our English, and we had trouble understanding them.  We waited 20 minutes, yes, 20 minutes, after finishing our meal before the waiter came back to clear our table and deliver the check.  This may be an isolated incident, or a problem due to new staff with the change from China Star, but other tables seemed to be having a similar issue.

(+): authentic Chinese food, fair prices

(-): poor service, average food

Would I go back again? Maybe once they work out the kinks and improve their service, but only if someone could recommend a specific dish to try."}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Sichuan food, will definitely come again! The ???is amazing, I order this every time I came! Good service too."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic Chinese restaurant, esp. Dry sautéed string bean plus sweet and spicy noodles!! Fantastic!! It's of proper size and very tasteful. Will go there again and wish it one of my favorite restaurants in the long term."}
{"text":"Great fast authentic Chinese food in Oakland! I would strongly recommend. Came here with coworkers for the lunch special and everyone liked their food. A great deal at 8! Minus one star for a piece of hair in one of my coworkers dishes."}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy your time here, be sure to ask for the Chinese menu! Apparently the restaurant has two types of menu: the regular menu where you'll find the standard, non-spicy dishes, and the Chinese menu where you can order from a huge selection of authentic Chinese dishes! 

Pros: spacious, great for a large group dining, quick service, tasty food. The price is great for the quality of food you get. Beware that when they say spicy, they really mean it! 
Cons: the menu is a little disorganized, so be sure to specify clearly what you want instead of mentioning the numbers only. 

Our favorite dishes: Congqing chicken, eggplant in garlic sauce, fish fillet in red pepper."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. American Chinese food, not authentic at all. Also I am not sure why one of the dishes had some really weird smell , not fresh...."}
{"text":"Ehh. My boyfriend and I went. The food was alright. The service was pretty far below mediocre. Then again, we're white. It does make for a fun date night, though. Sichuan Gourmet followed by desserts and tea at the Dobra Tea house across the street? Hell yeah."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Was visiting Pittsburgh on business. Took a chance and ordered delivery to my hotel. Glad I did. Enjoyed every bit. Huge portions and very authentic. Reminded me of what I had in China."}
{"text":"All dishes we ordered are very authentic Sichuan food.  The quantity and quality matched with the price.  It is worth to come back again to enjoy delicious Chinese food here."}
{"text":"Being there two times. it is very great! i love spicy food and rice noodle there. The first time we had ten people together there and had a good time. Then i v been there by myself for lunch which is cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent. The first time I are here it was some of the best Chinese food I have ever had. The next two times, the food was below average."}
{"text":"I was not sorry to see Pacific Ring go and so was excited to try a new restaurant!  All I can say is wow!  We ordered off of the authentic Chinese menu and really enjoyed our choices.  My husband had the beef soup which was very flavorful and a huge serving.  I ordered a dish with fish and tofu in a spicy sauce.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I also had a cold beef tripe appetizer.  Also very good.  As we live around the corner we will definitely be working our way through the menu on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese food in Pittsburgh. The hot & spicy fish filet is very very very good?"}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying I'm so elated I found this place.  If you've seen my other reviews, it can be most notably recognized that I don't have a deep affinity for Asian cuisine in Pittsburgh.  Actually that's being nice...Asian food here pretty much sucks. Meh.

That being said, China Star might be my favorite option for Chinese food if I'm clamoring for flavors that I'm very much acquainted with.  Some of it is greasy, but that's to be expected with ALL Chinese food, good or bad.  I'm ok with that.  It's the flavors and options that pulled me in and keep me coming back.  Went here with Jhon a couple of times now.  We've tried everything from the tea smoked duck, spinach and tofu soup, the spicy beef noodle soup, braised pork belly, stir fried chinese broccoli, spicy fish in the hot broth, chinese water spinach, spicy chicken in flaming pan, spicy frog in flaming pan, beef tendon, wontons in hot oil, etc.  Yes, we like to eat.  Don't judge.

The tea smoked duck is a MUST.  The smoky flavors that they were able to infuse in the duck, paired with it's naturally supple and fatty texture, give way to a super juicy and flavorful meat.  It doesn't need anything, standing alone as the star of the show.  The best part is the crispy skin.  Nothing is better than crispy skin, esp on a duck or pig.  Mmmmm... 

Other things I've reeaally enjoyed are the spinach and tofu soup and the spicy frog in flaming pan.  The soup is very light, brothy, and comforting.  It doesn't bog you down, but I found it to be quite refreshing and fresh.  I could imagine feeling loads better if I ate this while sick.  The spicy frog probably isn't for those who aren't so adventurous.  I personally love frog and have ordered every time I see it on a menu after extensively eating it in Vietnam.  The meat was succulent and flavorful, bathed in a sauce with tons of dried red chilies (like most spicy sichuan food), onions, garlic, and bamboo shoots.  I seriously couldn't stop eating it.  I even ate the chilies and bamboo shoots.  SO. GOOD.

Jhon particularly enjoys the duck like I do, but he also loves the spicy beef noodle soup.  We're both suckers for noodles.  I seriously love noodles.  The noodle soup has great flavors, has a good spicy kick, the beef is super tender like it's been braised for a while.  The only real deterrent is that I find it greasy.  I know I said I don't mind greasiness with Chinese food as it's pretty much expected, but the one exception in my mind is soup.  Who wants to slurp on oily soup?  Not this girl.  Kind of reminded me of food I had in China.  Still really great flavors.  Just don't drink all of the soup.

This is definitely on my list of favorite Pittsburgh restaurants to frequent."}
{"text":"Quoting my roommate, this is the best Chinese takeout I've ever had.

The Fish and Tofu in Spicy Broth and Mao's Pork are my two major staples. Spicy Shredded Potato and Mushroom and Bok Choy are my top two vegetable dishes. Since moving to Pittsburgh, I've ordered from here 5 days out of the week for the past half year, and will probably continue to do so."}
{"text":"I had lunch here, highly recommend their spicy boiled fish. Good decoration and friendly crew."}
{"text":"This is a nice Chinese food. We ordered duck, fish and some vegetables . All of them are nice"}
{"text":"Mediocre Chinese food. The quality of food was not so good. The service was even worse. The bill was not calculated correctly. And the waiter was not there when we need him. Perhaps that was because of a busy Friday...

Overall, I would like to recommend other Chinese restaurant on Murray, such as Rose Tea or Ka Mei."}
{"text":"Excellent, flavorful, spicy, authentic Szechuan fare and hearty servings. The hot & sour soup was loaded with tofu, egg, veggies as it should be and plenty of flavor, not just pepper. We loved the eggplant and garlic,sweet, spicy and tender. The flaming chicken is terrific, with wonderful vegetables, aromatics and plenty of pepper oil and red peppers. The tea smoked duck was a bit too salty and the skin was not as crispy as I would have liked but edible. We look forward to, our next visit."}
{"text":"Been for lunch twice.  Very reasonable prices.  Double cooked fish sounds really dry and unappealing, but I ordered it on a friend's suggestion the first time - and it was fantastic.  I've never had fish quite like it. And I liked it enough to drag other friends back and ordered the same thing again. Also giant portions on the fried rice!"}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese restaurant! It has very tasty dishes and quick delivery. The taste is quite traditional and make me feel like eating back in China!"}
{"text":"The location is great - on a quiet street in South Oakland with a good feel. Interior is also comfortable, with CPop playing quietly and a decent amount of seating. 3/4 of tables were taken at about 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon.

However, the low rating is due to the food. We ordered Mala beef tendon, which despite the nice thin slices, was far too slight on any mala flavor and overly salty. The sauteed green beans were also way too salty and though soft on the inside, did not have the blackened thin crisp desired on the skin. The last dish garners lowest marks - my typical favorite cumin lamb. The chunks were either too large and connected or too small, and they came out as though half deep-fried with puffy crisp. The flavor was incredibly sweet, causing great confusion, and there was hardly a cumin tinge whatsoever.

I'll have to try Sichuan Gourmet again, but the first impression didn't make the grade for me."}
{"text":"Nice staff. Quiet so far. Food looks good and is great. Very spicy so be careful. Menu is very extensive. I was traveling for an interview and stopped in. Everyone was very friendly and I was helped right away. I ordered noodles just to try. Very spicy but very good."}
{"text":"Help, I've died and gone to Chinese food heaven!

I highly recommend trying what China Star has to offer. Their Sichuan menu is frankly amazing. I adore the Flaming Fish Pan. Oh my goodness is this dish amazing! Soft succulent white fish in a mini wok, filled with sizzling garlic sauce, mushroom and sautéed bracken. This is a huge portion that can easily be split between 3 people (although, I could totally hog it for myself)! One word of caution, the sauce is mainly oil based so I suggest eating in and having it while it's hot. 

The steamed dumplings are fantastic and so is their garlic eggplant and mushroom - bok choy dish. Just writing this review has made want to go back for more! Their service has always been friendly and you can ask them for the true authentic choices. I can't wait to continue exploring the rest of their menu!"}
{"text":"we came here at Sunday afternoon, ordered ?????this is a quite nice dish. Carefully prepared with balanced flavor. It was a quite pleasant late lunch."}
{"text":"This is a transitional Sichuan food. If you like spicy, this is the right place. We ordered duck, fish and some vege, all of them taste good."}
{"text":"Great overlooked Chinese place in Squill.  It's got that classic \"I burnt the dinner on Christmas so I'm going out to Chinese\" vibe in the decor and atmosphere, you know what I'm talking about.  But it's also got a great expansive authentic menu-  It can be hard to figure out what to order."}
{"text":"The hot spicy beef hot pot just might be the best thing I've ever eaten. Great service. Awesome food. Can't wait to come back! A must go if you like Chinese food!"}
{"text":"I would just like to point out that there are two different China Star restaurants on Murray Ave.  The one across from the Giant Eagle is the good one.  They just opened a few month ago.  This is their second restaurant, so you know they're pretty good.  Their first restaurant's on McKnight Road in McIntyre Square.  I recommend reading a few of the review for their other restaurant if you want get an idea of what they're about.

The good China Star serves authentic Sichuan style Chinese food.  You can tell they're authentic and good cause when you walk in, many of their customers are Chinese.  For those of you who like the general tso's and lo meins, not to worry cause they have all the \"fake\" Chinese food too.  Some of my favorites are their tan tan noodles, scallion pancake, shrimp in chili sauce, double cooked pork, garlic egg plant and they have hot pot!  So, if you don't know which China Star to go to, pick this one.  It's just a few minutes away and the food is much MUCH better.  I would give this restaurant a 4.5 out of 5 stars just because the serves could have been better (not to say it was bad).

I've actually tried the other China Star too.  No authentic food there, but their \"fake\" Chinese food wasn't bad...it wasn't very good either.  It's kind of funny but I think the non-authentic Chinese food from the other China Star is better.  In short, if I feel like some good old general tso's, I'd rather go somewhere else.  I would give this restaurant a 2 out of 5 stars because the food is edible but nothing special at all."}
{"text":"Sichuan Gourmet is a really incredible authentic restaurant as long as you plan to eat off of the Chinese Menu rather than the American one.  There are so many authentic options that makes it easy for everyone to find something.  For those who want something on simpler side, the basil chicken is sweet and flavorful, however, the authentic kung pao chicken is one of my personal favorites.  The restaurant is not very formal, but it is still a friendly atmosphere. The service is alright, but can sometimes be a bit slow.  

Overall, this is great place to find authentic Chinese food that can't really be matched by any other place in Oakland."}
{"text":"bad service. Arrived at 9:20 and they asked us to take out at 9:50 because they had NOT started on our order yet! Still Tipped but never visit again."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try this place for dinner on Sunday night. The restaurant is quite large, and though it was already busy, we were quickly seated. 

We ordered from the Chinese-style menu: scallion lamb, spicy beef tendon, sweet and sour fish, and Chinese spinach. The meal was very satisfying, especially paired with tea. My dad had a lot of rice, which is usually a sign that the food is good (or that he's hungry, but I think it was the former in this case). The lamb was tender and flavorful. The spice of the beef tendon was tolerable, even enjoyable, for me, and it was paired with a numbing sensation. The fish was breaded in strips, and I enjoyed that the coating held its integrity and a little of its crisp instead of becoming mush in the sauce. The Chinese spinach hit the spot as well.

It's a little pricey for me to eat here often, but it's definitely on my list of places to get Chinese food when I'm missing home."}
{"text":"Check the menu before you come! This location doesn't have the same menu as the location in Squirrel Hill, and many dishes are missing. The chicken section on the Oakland menu only had about 5 or 6 dishes. Also, my water was only refilled once in the hour I was there and that was because I flagged someone down. I'll be sticking to the Squirrel Hill location. 

Removing another star because the waitress offered to pack our food and neglected to pack any rice. Never been to a Chinese place that doesn't give you rice to take with your food or at least asks if you want it."}
{"text":"We were introduced to this fabulous restaurant back in 2013 and since then we are literally hooked up with their traditional chinese dishes. A chinese food connoisseur can't leave the restaurant unsatisfied. To be honest we never tried their \"Americanized chinese menu\" but the traditional menu always hits the 'T-spot' :-)  Shredded pork with hot pepper, Kong Pao Chicken Chengdu style, chengdu jumbo shrimp (HOT !), and the flaming pan (chicken/ pork/fish) are the chartbusters.. Only thing we miss is their shrimp dumpling (we ordered recently and it was not the same as before ). Overall it's a nice restaurant with good food, convenient location and friendly environment."}
{"text":"The best traditional Chinese Dian food I've never eatten in Pittsburgh.
  Especially, the braised pork shoulder in spicy bean paste. And fish fillet in spicy broth, chongqing style."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I love it! They have legitimately spicy food, not just hot.

It replaces the Indian place on Atwood and it is an improvement. Please come here and support our local restaurants!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite steakhouses nearby the residencw hall, if u want to have a good meal and also want to save ur time, this place is a good choice."}
{"text":"Never again. Bad service, bad food quality. We ordered bunch of vegetarian dishes and had asked our server to make sure there is no meat in anything we ordered. He assured to us that everything we ordered is vegetarian and  he will notify the Kitchen to confirm. When we got our food, 3 out of 5 dishes had meat. When we called our server, his reply was the dishes are vegetarian while I am showing him bunch of pieces of meat separated from the dish. He took the dishes back without being sorry. When we got the food back, it was so bad that it was not even worth putting on the table. The restaurant was so short staffed that our server only stopped by at our table 3 times (to take order, to bring food and to bring the check). Went here based on many good reviews here on yelp but that wasn't the experience we had today."}
{"text":"We just had a terrible takeout from this restaurant brown rice was mushy. The lamb tasted old and the shrimp with garlic sauce was swimming in oil.
It is the last time for me!
Really bad

{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of the Squirrel Hill branch, but this new branch in Oakland is definitely growing on me! The menu items here differ slightly from the one in Squirrel Hill's so don't come here expecting to order your usual from the older branch. I've only tried their spicy beef noodle soup here and it was great. Huge portions (enough for two meals for me) and very flavorful. 

They also did a great job on the interior. I always feel nice stepping into this restaurant. If you're feeling some Chinese food, Sichuan Gourmet will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Went there many times, and I still love it and have never been disappointed. As a person originally from Sichuan, the food served at Sichuan gourmet is absolutely authentic for me. Sometimes, I can even hear cooks talking loudly in Sichuan dialect. Advice for Non-Chinese: forget about the General Tao's menu, be more adventure, and ask the server for recommendation on the menu with Chinese if you have problem ordering. 

I would say, start from the appetiser if you are too concerned."}
{"text":"My entire notion of Chinese food was imploded and then rebuilt here - for the better and grander. The flaming fish was the bomb! Literally. It is not for the timid. My mouth was on fire, and I will go through that again and again. It was that good! The other dishes on our table were good but nothing compares. Oh, order from the Chinese menu. General Tso's is not worth it."}
{"text":"Great food, if you are a Chinese looking for an authentic Chinese food, this is the best you could expect... Even better than most of Chinese restaurant in China..."}
{"text":"not your average chinese takeout or eat in restaurant. stopped here a while back for my uncle's birthday and he ordered from the Sichuan menu. let me tell you it is VERY SPICY! we ordered the fish hot pot, pork intestines and a few more dishes. food came out nice and hot, staff was nice and friendly and wasn't hesitant to explain each dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"This review is purely for an ORDER FOR DELIVERY- via Grubhub.

The western lake beef soup was great. Fair portion for 9.99$


Green beans w. Minced Pork - 10.99$ on grubhub, tasted TOTALLY HORRID. Portion was equal to that of a 6$ dish, will not be ordering for delivery again.

Based on all the positive reviews, maybe I'll come in to eat... Portion must be bigger than a small round container for 11$


P.S. Grubhub being the excellent service they are, gave a 15$ credit for this order.
Unfortunately the restaurant was not kind enough to give a fair portion."}
{"text":"I can only comment on their lunch specials to go.  I have stopped in here several times in the past few weeks and have been very satisfied.  Lunch specials are about 6.50 to 7 bucks and are very filling and absolutely delicious.  The food is authentically spicy, so if that's not your thing be sure to look for the items that are marked non-spicy.  I particularly enjoy the spicy fish fillet."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for many times. The foods are very good. Tastes like eating in China! Services are good, too. I have taken my friends here many times when they visit me. I will difinitely recommand this to my frind if they come to Pittsburgh."}

{"text":"A nice restaurant in general. The dish size is super big! Good for family gathering and large group."}
{"text":"The best Chinese restaurant here so far. And the service is very polite. It's close to the University of Pittsburgh campus so it's convenient for the students to go there"}
{"text":"Went out with my wife and a couple of her co-workers who were from China. They couldn't recommend it enough. We had a lovely time. We ordered a crispy-style chicken, dumplings, a dish with pork belly, asparagus, and it was plenty to go around."}
{"text":"Ordered again today after an hour and 25 minutes still no sign of my food so I call in and he says it'll be another 10 minutes after calling his driver. I live 12 minutes away from this location. Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"Disappointed every time. It's not spicy at all and some dishes are even sweet! And it's slow and expensive as well, compared to other Chinese restaurants. Extremely hate the way they deal with chickens, they just don't know how to cut the meat and bones right!"}
{"text":"Room is cold, better keep you jacket on, it is winter of course.
Fish in flaming pan served cold(fish meat, vege is ok), but warmed up by the flame underneath, thanks GOD!
Cold dish is the best, good job chef. 
3 cups chicken is dry, it happens when you reheat the chicken meat. 
Mapo tofu is good, and hot, a decent dish."}

The food on the blackboard are tremendous! 
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My experience with this restaurant was awful. I ordered a spicy beef soup and received an oily, half empty container. It was definitely not a soup. I called the restaurant and they refused to give me a discount for the mediocre food. The walnut chicken was also very oily. Stay away from this place."}
{"text":"The food was not impressive. The service was bad. The waitress was mute!!! She did not greet us at all. Threw the menu on the table. Did not ask what we need or how we were doing after delivering the food. She did not say thank you or good bye to us. 
I will not come back unless they train their waitresses how to speak politely."}

{"text":"Had dinner at their new store in oakland! Great taste, price is less than I expected! Authentic Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Great great Chinese restaurant in Pit!!
Ordered Ganguo fish and Jiaohua Chicken
They are both awesome!!
If you like authentic Chinese flavor, definitely come and try it out!
Szechuan and Northwestern flavors will never let you down!

{"text":"I've been living in Pittsburgh for 4 years and Sichuan Gourmet is definitely most recommended place for authentic Sichuan style food in Pittsburgh Area. I personally recommend top 3 dishes which my friends and I often order. 

No.1 Chongqin Chicken: all my American, Chinese and even Indian Friends love it. I really like it but won't eat too much(they are fried and I know it is hard to stop eating once you started). I would only eat it on my cheat day during the long week of workouts.

No.2 Tea Smoke Duck: I've tried this dish in many Chinese restaurants and so far Sichuan Gourmet is among the best. I would recommend picking the date when the restaurant buy the fresh duck(you probably need some connections inside the restaurants, be friends with the manager:) ).

No.3 Pork Shoulder in hot source: when I was a kid, my mom often cook pork shoulder for me, I really enjoy the soft texture of the meat. After I came to US, it became my personal favorite dish in Sichuan Gourmet. However, I would not always be able to order it: sometimes my friends don't eat pork, sometimes this dish is too much for 2 people. I highly recommend order this dish when you have more than 3 people."}
{"text":"i have been living in Pittsbutgh for 5 years. Sichuan Gourmet is always my favorite. Now they finally came to oakland. If you are looking for American Chinese food like General Tso chicken, this is not your place. This restaurant features authentic Chinese food. My personal favorite is cumin lamb and fish fillet in hot broth with special Sichuan peppercorns."}
{"text":"This is definetely the best authentic Chinese food in town, no doubt! I have been trying out authentic Chinese food for 5 years in town, this one is the best, make sure you ask for the authentic menu which is black( the american chinese food menu is white), they usually don't automaticly give you the authentic menu if you dont appear to be speaking Chinese, I had steamed perch fish, spicy lobster, spiced fish filet in broth, they all extremly delisious, for the appetizer I recommend the beef tripe. Anyway, this is wonderful"}
{"text":"Awful delivery service.  I waited 1 1/2 hour for my delivery of two lunches.  I cancelled the order and will never patronize this business."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of their yong chow fried rice. Calling it fragrant is an understatement, because it's mad delicious. 

Being a sichuan restaurants, they aren't kidding when they say spicy, so if you have a low spicy tolerance you might want to rethink visiting this place. 

Portions are reasonable, service is great and ambience is cozy. Nothing much more to say, but give it a try if you're looking for a little more spice in your meals! 

Fun fact, they also serve bubble tea here but it's more on the expensive side ($4.50) but it comes in a default large cup."}
{"text":"The menu had many unique options but was a bit overwhelming. I wish the staff had been more helpful in recommending things to try. I liked the food I ordered, out of people I visited with one liked the food as well and the other only liked 2 of the 4 dishes we had ordered."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork with sizzling rice from the Chinese side.  It was wonderful, rice with tangy pork with black vinegar, I think, ginger, garlic, and soy.  Yum.  From the American side, the orange chicken was good too.  Will return to try more!"}
{"text":"A large Szechuan menu with many different dishes (including your ususal Szechuan fare) at a reasonable price. The portions are very large, and two dishes for two people is more than enough.

Our two dishes (traditional fried green beans with port and a spicy duck) were tasty and satisfying, although they fell a bit short of being excellent. The duck did not have this nice bite of Szechuan pepper, as I had expected. Based on our two dishes, I'd say 3 stars rather than 4, but many dishes on the other table looked very appetizing. 

We will be back to try more dishes, and perhaps update the rating. 

Finally, I'd say that the quality of the food compares to the quality of the last page of How Lee menu."}
{"text":"I'm giving the place 4 stars for 3 reasons:

1 - Everyone at my table really enjoyed their food, minus myself.  They all ordered from the American portion of the menu - Walnut Chicken, Chicken with Broccoli, and Vegetarian Ho Fun.  I tasted the Ho Fun, and it was very good.
2 - Ambience.  I really enjoyed the décor.  It was very clean, and didn't smell of MSG as soon as you walked inside the door.  
3 - The servers were friendly and prompt.

It didn't get 5 because I really didn't like my dish.  I got the Mapo Tofu.  It was the right amount of spicy, but the sauce was very, very oily.  I'm also not the biggest fan of silken tofu.  Although they use that at most Asian restaurants, the silken tofu with the sauce just made the entire dish slimy.  I ordered specifically off the Sichuan menu because of recommendations on Yelp.  I was leaning towards General Tso's Tofu prior to my visit.  I think if we go back, that's what I'll choose. 

Also, yelpers, if you yelp them, you get 8% off your next dining experience!  At least I did.  So, super cool!"}
{"text":"better cooked and seasoned Chinese food than most places around the area. nice establishment to enjoy the meal in as well. have had a variety of items off the menu and I can't complain about anything. friendly staff and wick service."}
{"text":"Real Chinese! It has the essence of Sichuan food -- spicy, which is not quite easy to look for in the US."}
{"text":"I like the fish filet in hot broth, the sauteed shredded potato with vinegar, the chestnut napa. They are all so tasty! I would definitely come back and revisit it again!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my meal here very much. Perhaps I should have tried something off the \"authentic\" menu but I just wanted a simple American style Hunan chicken. The dish was slathered in way too much sauce and it was too sugary and not salty/spicy enough. The hot and sour soup was delicious though. I would give it another try but first I am going to explore some other Chinese options in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Very good restaurant!

Pros:
The food here is authentic Sichuan food. It's spicy and flavorful.

The restaurant is spacious, so if you need to hold a huge party, this restaurant can do that. They also have larger tables for 8 people or more.

Cons:
How Lee across the street makes some dishes better than Sichuan Gourmet in my opinion (my friends disagree though).

TOO NOISY. Just like other Chinese restaurants, this one is usually noisy and packed with people."}
{"text":"This is a quite good place to have Chinese food. The dishes are tasty but the prices are a little bit high."}
{"text":"The hot and sour yam noodles have been a standby in my family for a number of years, perhaps over a name change or two! In any case this continues to be my baseline restaurant for Sichuan cuisine anywhere, and it compares favorably with places in Chicago and such. We of course always order off the Chinese menu, and it has plenty of variety, namely enough that we can come back pretty often, not be bored, and be pleased with our meals. Not quite five stars due to some inconsistencies (ie yam noodles have really inconsistent amounts of soup with them to the point that it's totally different in terms of whether it's sauce or soup), and because occasionally you'll land on something that's just a dud."}
{"text":"The food was ok. Too salty in my opinion. The service definitely could've been better"}
{"text":"The best (Sichuan) dumplings ever! 
Their authentic menu is quite good too.
The big mushrooms in basil and garlic sauce is great. 
They have an american menu if you don't feel like trying something new"}
{"text":"I love Sichuan food but for some reason this location is not nearly as good as the one in Squirrel Hill. If you live in Oakland please make the extra mile hike to their other location and you will be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Its menu offers a great variety of choices compared to other Chinese restaurants in the city. 

This is my first time dining at this place. I love all the dishes that I ordered. I ordered fish fillet with silk tofu and shredded pork with seasoning tofu..
I really love the fish fillet with silky tofu dish. The fish is so tender and full of flavor...This dish is usually really salty.but the chef here made it just right..the tofu is really silky and has great flavor ..I have ordered many fish fillet with silky tofu dish at different Sichuan restaurants and I would say that this is one of the best fish fillet with silky tofu dish I have ever tried. 
The shredded pork with seasoning tofu is great as well..but personally i think it is a little bit too oily..but overall is great

Both dishes are relatively big portions ..we could not finish both dishes for 2 people..

The service is prompted..they served 2 dishes within 10 minutes from the time we ordered..

I would recommend this authentic Chinese restaurant in this city."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my food didn't know that they deliver. I would always try to order before I came home but never did."}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food. Can't complain about the food, it is very good. But the environment is noisy, the place is crowded. So the stars are all for the food."}
{"text":"Great very authentic food I come here all the time and all the real Chinese are there. We ordered a seafood dish, a vegetable dish, and a noodle dish."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food. I've spent time in China and lived in Taiwan. 

Use the chinese style food menu... Read the menu carefully... Order a lot of stuff... Dont forget about vegetables (steamed veggies and cold cucumber salad are awesome) Bring friends... Be prepared to spend a chunk of cash... And always ask for very little oil. 

I haven't tried their hot pot yet, but I'm sure it is a treat! I can't find hot pot anywhere else in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food you can find in Pittsburgh almost the same quality like the restaurants I've been in Beijing, China. 

Very authentic, great taste and a huge menu. And reasonably priced as well. Very quite at off-dinner/lunch hours."}
{"text":"Got this in CMU lunch box lol.
Thanks for the paper and ink. We need to value this in our digital world."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the first time, service was great. The waiter was very friendly and happy. The second time, the waitress was rude and service was crappy. 

Unfortunately, with the risk of getting this server again, I will be going to the Oakland location from now on. She did not greet us and neither did she smile at any point. In fact, she seemed angry that we were there. Not to mention, she threw our check at us. Yes, she threw it without saying a word. A simple \"thank you\" would've been nice. 

Both times, the food was consistent and tasted very authentic. The majority of the menu items are spicy, which is how I like it. Sichuan Gourmet has a huge menu and it can be overwhelming when you don't have the slightest idea what to order. Like myself. So I found myself looking around at other tables to see what they got. A lot of people seem to get the flaming pans which I have yet to try. But it seems like popular items are the Dan Dan Noodles and Dry Sautéed Green Beans. The Dan Dan Noodles are life-changing. However, I will say the Oakland location does a better job of it, mainly because Oakland's noodles are a flat noodle, and Squirrel Hill's are a round noodle. The noodles at the Oakland location are also a nice al dente while Squirrel Hill's was a bit over cooked and mushy. The flavor is delicious at both places, though. I really enjoyed the Dry Sautéed Green Beans as they were very flavorful and rather crunchy; it's a great item to order alongside anything spicy (for when you need a break from the tongue-numbing spices). I've tried a few other items from the menu and all have been consistently enjoyable and well-balanced in flavors. 

Overall, huge, extensive menu. Food is consistent. But service is hit or miss. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Can't get any better than this! Sichuan Gourmet has two locations and while I love both, I think I like the Oakland location a tiny bit more, mostly for the modern decor and the quick service. I've never had to wait for a table at the Oakland location. However, the menu at the Squirrel Hill location is much more extensive and the dining room is much larger. I truly love both locations. At the Oakland location, my all-time favorite go-to dish is the Dan Dan Noodles. These are perfectly spicy, tangy, sweet and nutty. I've also tried the seafood tofu soup (listed as one of their \"most wanted\" dishes) and I found it to be very comforting on a cold day. Unlike many of their other dishes, this soup is not spicy. Their pork dumplings are great too, and I've also tried their spicy beef noodle soup. Being Vietnamese and a lover of pho, I have high standards for beef noodle soups. Their beef noodle soup did not disappoint, although I felt it could use a better balance of flavors. The beef noodle soup is salty and spicy, lacking sweet and tangy flavors that I like from the Dan Dan noodles. Lastly, their steamed pork bun (listed under desserts) was to our surprise, correctly labeled as a dessert. It was a very nice savory-sweet ending to our meal. I have not had anything I didn't like at Sichuan Gourmet."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best, most authentic Chinese food in Pittsburgh! Try the Chongqing Chicken, the Mapo Tofu, the Xinjiang style lamb-- all fantastic! Service is good, hours very convenient. Take it from someone who lived on China for 3 years- this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"Good place to have lunch or dinner. Tried the ??? and ?? and they are all good. Typical Sichuan food?"}
{"text":"Hallelujah!  An authentic Chinese restaurant smack in the middle of Squirrel Hill!

In my three years in Pittsburgh so far, I'm often asked, \"How do you like Pittsburgh?\"  And my answer is always, \"It's exceeded my expectations!\" and I mean that in the best way possible.  But then I always have to temper my enthusiasm with the fact that there is absolutely no reasonable Chinese fare to be had (that, and I miss being around tons of Asian Americans).  Anyway, I used to pass by this place and think, \"If they do dim sum AND Japanese food and whatever else kind of Asian food they think they cook, they must do everything poorly.\"  Apparently that wasn't so far off.

But a few months ago, I noticed that the signage had changed, and that when I looked in the windows, the place was FULL of Chinese people!  And that, my friends, is the mark of a good Chinese restaurant.  I'm sad to admit that I waited this long to try it, since I live just a few blocks away, but man oh man, am I glad I did.

This is the real deal, Sichuan spicy goodness.  We got the lo mein (don't shoot me, it was for my non-Chinese husband), garlic eggplant, and fish fillets in hot pepper sauce/broth (literal translation from Chinese: Water cooked fish).  OH MY GOD AWESOME. 

I can't wait to try some of the other goodies they serve here.  But make no mistake - come here for excellent Chinese food.  Thank the heavens above, Pittsburgh culinary options really have come along!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest Asian restaurants in the neighborhood - great food great service.  You can not go wrong."}
{"text":"One of the better Chinese places in Pittsburgh. Consistent meats, delicious sauces, and good enough service. I've also gotten takeout from them, and it's just as lovely."}
{"text":"I frequent Sichuan Gourmet quite often for the lunch specials at both the Atwood and Squirrel location, and am usually quite satisfied with both the quality and portion size of the food. 

However, I brought a large group of my friends over a few days ago and we experienced horrendously slow service. We ordered around 15 dishes for around 15 people and it took 10 minutes per dish to come out. The table next to us had the same number of people, ordered after us, and got all their dishes meaningfully faster than us. I would have to assume that their kitchen and/or communication is not equipped to handle large numbers of people.

TLDR: Lunch specials are good but do not recommend large numbers of people."}
{"text":"They are awesome. Best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh no doubt. I think it's also better than the new branch in Oakland too. Glad we came here for Chinese New Year's Eve dinner!!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best chinese place in town."}
{"text":"There are many choices on the menu, and we ordered the dumplings in chili oil, which were good, the beef noodle soup, and the honey walnut chicken. The noodles were bland, and the honey walnut chicken was not hot when it came out, and it wasn't really different from regular chinese takeout from cheaper places (although the chicken had a lot less fried breading as cheaper places, which is good). For the quality, this restaurant was overpriced, and we most likely won't go back. We also had to end up asking a waitress for our check, because our waitress pretty much forgot about our existence."}
{"text":"We ordered the beef tripe/shank appetizer, fish fillet in hot broth, beef rice noodles, and hot and spicy crispy chicken with rice crust. The appetizer tasted great and met expectations. The fish fillet also had good taste and wasn't too spicy (I prefer more spice) but it did have an overload of peppercorn. The beef rice noodles did well to balance the appetizer and fish fillet. The crispy chicken's texture was good, but it was really, really salty. I left some constructive criticism for our waitress, and hopefully they can improve these dishes down the road."}
{"text":"Chinese menu is quite good, especially the Chongqing Style Fish Fillet in Spicy Broth.  What gets this establishment a one star is its abysmal service.  I place an order on the phone for Pork in Sweet Flour Paste.  I repeat the order about five times since it's not a popular item.  I even have the girl repeat the menu after me.  The girl suggests chicken is better with that sauce so I go with that.  Now when I get home I find she packed me sweet and sour chicken.  I abhor this stuff.  So I call and tell the girl that she packed me the wrong thing.  The girl tells me: \"Sweet and sour chicken is also good so just eat that.\"  Okay.. I try one piece and find out it is the same abhorrent stuff.  So I take it back to them driving all the way back to Murray Ave and tell her I cannot eat this.  Now the girl tells me: \"Pork in Sweet Flour Paste is not on the menu and maybe you looked at the menu of some other Chinese restaurant.\"  So I show her the item from their own menu.  Now the girl tells me: \"Oh you know what, Chicken in Sweet Flour Paste and Sweet and Sour Chicken are the same thing.\"  I know for a fact that they are different.  One is 12.99, the other is 11.99.  One is on the Chinese menu, the other is on the American menu.  I point this out to her.  Now the girl tells me: \"Did you eat it?\".  I tell her I ate just one piece (as mentioned above).  She gives me this dirty look as if I'm some moocher trying to return consumed food.  I hold down my anger.  She finally calls someone on the phone and reluctantly hands me the price of the item in cash.  She was evidently looking for an excuse to flick me off from the beginning, like I'm some annoyance.  Why?  Because I am not Chinese like most of the clientele?  Shame.. shame.. I cannot comprehend why management would choose to run this otherwise upstanding establishment in this way."}
{"text":"Had the Kung Pao tofu with white rice and a scallion pancake. One of the best scallion pancakes I've had and so eat A LOT of scallion pancakes. Kung Pao tofu was good but really sweet and I wish it had more peanuts in it. Portions are huge but worth the price. Service was quick and servers were attentive. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is one of two Sichuan/Chengdu cuisine restaurants in Squirrel Hill, the other being Chengdu Gourmet. 
I've lived long enough in Squirrel Hill to see this restaurant go through several reincarnations as a Chinese restaurant. This latest is not bad as far as cuisine is concerned. I would suggest ordering from the Chinese menu. 
The reason I'm giving this review only 2 stars is the service. I ordered a take-out and I ordered it online.  By the time I arrived, some 20 minutes later, the food was packed & ready to go. I picked it up and quite fortuitously mentioned the two items I had ordered. And of course, they had messed up the order, even though I had received a written confirmation of my order. So now I was faced with a wait. 
I expected the manager lady, dressed in a white Mao style shirt to offer apologies. None were offered. She sent the pack back to the kitchen and quite impassively rang me up. And here I was expecting some apology, perhaps even the offer of a discount to make up for the inconvenience of waiting. Nope. Nothing. Nada. Just an impassive, almost icy, condescending look. Thank you very much. That is it for me! Bon appetit!"}

{"text":"It's a great place with a lot of options :D my India friend says she really likes the Chengdu jumbo shrimp!"}
{"text":"An interesting mix of authentic and Americanized offerings is available at China Star. 

The crispy noodles served at the start of the meal come with only duck sauce. Make sure to ask for the hot mustard to mix with it! 

The steamed pork dumplings had an odd flavor, the filling had a taste almost reminiscent of a hot dog's meat. Certainly not what I was expecting.

The egg roll tasted fresh but extremely bland. I wouldn't recommend them. 

From previous visits we had found we didn't like their Peking duck, so we tried their tea smoked duck instead. I must admit it is a much better choice when you're in the mood for duck. 

The best part of the meal was the \"Flaming Fish Pan\". I ordered it based on Ishi G.'s recommendation, and I was not dissapointed. The fish is moist and delicious, while the sauce was hot - in both meanings of the word. Spicy thanks to the pepper, and boiling thanks to the flame burning beneath it. A must order if you like fish."}
{"text":"I ordered their food with Grubhub and I was disappointed with the food received. Secondly, they refused to refund my order. I received General Tso's Chicken and it was mushy all around. It tasted soggy and there was no bite to it, it was just like eating slop. I'm used to eating General's Tsos that is a bit crispy, so this entree was totally off to me. I had ordered Chow Mein and it didn't come with noodles. I checked back on the Grubhub site and it says that it didn't come with noodles. I'm sorry, but I saw the name and assumed a noodle dish came with noodles. I understand I made the mistake, but why even put it under noodles if it doesn't come with noodles? There are a ton of other Chinese restaurants in Squirrel Hill, you would be wise to spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have tried many Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh.
Sichuan Gourmet is the best."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. My friend from China took me here and knew exactly what to order. I love Sichuan style food.  They have two menus I always order from the Chinese menu not the American one.  I get the flaming hot chicken it comes with bamboo shoots.  They have amazing dan dan noodles.  And they just remodeled, looks great."}
{"text":"Don't come here for lunch -- terrible!

When this restaurant opened, I used to come here fairly often for dinner.  I like spicy Sichuan food. But after three bad meals in a row and indifferent service (bordering on hostile), I decided that there were much better options in Squirrel Hill, and haven't been back for a couple of years.

Today I happened to be in that area at lunchtime. Other places were looking busy/slow, so I decided to give Sichuan Gourmet another chance.  Big mistake.  They didn't give me the \"authentic\" menu, and I was in a hurry, so when the waitress reappeared I just ordered the Sichuan Beef lunch special -- asking specifically for \"extra spicy\" -- with rice and an egg roll. Food came promptly, with the egg roll coming later.

This was the worst Chinese food I've had in years.  The small portion of Sichuan beef was just strips of beef in a flavorless brown sauce and a some chunky strips of vegetable, mostly celery.  There was no detectable spice, and very little detectable flavor except for the stringy, nearly raw celery.  The rice was waterlogged and soggy.  The egg roll, when it came, was a thick, doughy, undercooked wrapper, filled with some nondescript mix of vegetables.  Overall, very disappointing.  I left most of it, paid the check, and went down the street to get a sandwich.  The waitress knew better than to ask if everything was OK.

On the plus side, nothing was rotten and it didn't make me sick.

This place does seem to be popular with Chinese students, and I saw some decent-looking dishes going by.  Maybe you get different food if you order in Chinese.  But I won't be going there again, and certainly can't recommend it to anyone else."}
{"text":"After getting into Pittsburgh on Sunday night around 7pm, I was looking for a Chinese place to deliver downtown. Surprise surprise a lot of 4 star Chinese places don't deliver, not on a Sunday night anyway. I was lucky to come across this place. I ordered a shrimp fried rice, and since it's Sichuan food, I had to get cumin lamb. I judge a lot Sichuan places by the quality of their cumin lamb. 

Once I received the food, I knew I'd gotten a bit more than one person can eat. There was one bowl full of shrimp fried rice that was enough for two meals, and then there was the cumin lamb that came with a separate container of regular steamed rice. The shrimp fried rice was OK. I probably shouldn't have eaten it together with the cumin lamb. 

I loved the amount of lamb in the cumin lamb. A lot of Sichuan places give you a plate with about half dried peppers and half lamb, but not in this case. There was actually about 90% lamb vs peppers. Plus, under the doughcrust there is actually a good amount of lamb, instead of just fried dough. It was very strong in a sweet and sour kind of way, with the cumin added in. Also quite spicy in that numbing way Sichuan food has. I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, because the cumin lamb was so strong, the shrimp fried rice was bland in comparison. It had a bit of salty and fried rice taste to it, but the shrimp didn't really have a shrimp taste. 

Great takeout Chinese place if you're in Downtown Pittsburgh on business or something, and it's pretty reasonably priced. I got the two dishes for about $33 bucks and it lasted me three meals."}
{"text":"They have a waitress with the worst attitude I've ever seen in any restaurant. The manager even argues with costumers for giving less tip to that waitress. The only star is for their food, average Chinese around Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Would recommend this place to anyone who crazes for authentic Szechuan food. The only drawback is that hot spicy fish can be better with fresh fish."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on Friday night and I'm so happy I finally got to try this place. At first I was a bit confused by the two menus but our waiter nicely explained how one listed their Chinese-American dishes and the other authentic Chinese. My husband ordered from the American and I decided to go with the Chinese Kung pao chicken. The orange chicken was the best I have ever had! The Kung Pao was pretty good too. The ginger gives it a very unique taste but it was way to spicy for me. Right away my whole face was flushed and my nose was runny. Our waiter was so nice and attentive, I really enjoyed my dinner and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Oh man was this place good.  A huge menu with a hundred things we wanted to order and try.  The hand pulled noodles with oil sauce were superb, and the hot and spicy chicken with rice was also excellent.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the food was great.  Would love to come back and try several other things on the menu.  A delicious and legit tasting non Americanized Sichuan restaurant."}
{"text":"I used to like the food in this restaurant until i ordered takeout today. There's a piece of garbage like plastic bag in the noodle i ordered today. This is seriously disgusting."}
{"text":"????? - E.04 - or as they say in English, fish fillet in spicy broth, CHONGQING STYLE  ... 

Anyone who doesn't like it, please consider not eating chinese food (ever again).. it's not for you.. !"}
{"text":"What happened? Came here in summer and dishes were delicious, but subsequent 3 or 4 visits have been meh.

My boyfriend loved the Amazing Chicken the first time he tried it. It was crispy and lightly coated in a subtly sweet sauce. The couple of times we came back to satisfy his craving, the chicken has been soggy and drowning in a frightening amount of sauce (even though the last 2 times we requested \"light sauce\").

I loved the beef noodle soup the first time I had it, but the quality of the beef they have been using in the soup is atrocious. Last time, only 1/3 of the beef chunks were edible. The rest of the meat was either too tough/chewy or too fatty.

Don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner with extremely fast service on a busy Saturday night. Ask for Qin when you stop in."}
{"text":"REALLY greasy foods. I ordered the tofu, didnt think that was too bad, however the food portion compare to the rice is ridiculous. Too much rice!"}
{"text":"Delicious and (apparently) authentic Chinese food.  Don't order off the 'American' menu - live a little.  I've ordered the seafood sizzling rice dish both times I've been and it's totally worth it.  They pour some kind of broth over the platter table side so you get a free show - it smells delicious and tastes even better.  We also got the Mao style pork belly dish which was unbelievable.  I'll be back and will try new dishes because everything I've had has so far been so good!

They sometimes have groupons so check to get one before you go! Great deal"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place in Pittsburgh (and I'm Chinese, so trust me!) They definitely take the Sichuan ma la spice seriously, so it's not for the faint of heart. You'll be sweating and your whole mouth will be numb. Also, a warning for those who don't like garlic either because everything is super heavy on garlic as well. It's a great value because everything comes in huge, family size portions (great for groups!) I highly recommend the pork belly appetizer! As for entrees, I normally get the fish filet with tofu, it comes as a hot bowl simmering over a fire. It is definitely spicy! I like the string beans and eggplant dishes too. For dessert, they have mantou (like Chinese steamed bread buns) which makes me so nostalgic, and it comes steamed and fried. It's definitely an experience coming here! Parking is pretty tough around here though, it's right in the heart of South Oakland."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic Chinese food.  Order from the Chinese menu for the best food here.  Currently my favorite Chinese food I have tried in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Great option for Sichuan food in Pittsburgh. I've been here a couple times, and every time it's satisfied my craving for spicy, hearty, filling (and oily) Chinese food. Some of my favorites are Diced chicken with dried pepper chongqing style, Smoky pork belly with seasoning tofu, and Dried sauteed green beans with smoked pork. Watch out for those peppers when you're eating those famous fried chicken bits! Another veggie option I also like is the snow pea leaves.

It's a Chinese restaurant so I don't really expect good service, but I think it was fine. The restaurant itself is pretty spacious which is nice."}
{"text":"Great food options!  Fresh and really amazing food, large portions and friendly staff.  Fun atmosphere with some pretty cool art hangings.  Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"My favourite Chinese food in Pittsburgh. It's spicy, hot and amazing for my tastebuds. Because I can't remember the names of the items, each time we try out new stuff, and we haven't been disappointed ever. The squirrel hill location has more options of food and more hospitable staff. A big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I wasn't sure how authentic Chinese food tastes like, so I chose to visit this place recommended by my Chinese friends, and its was a total value for money. The shrimp noodle was yum and so were the crispy chicken. The spice level was on a higher side, but manageable. However it was really difficult communicating with the server, since he spoke very little English. Though he was trying his best to explain the details of the items. The cost was also very student friendly. So, overall, a big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This Oakland establishment has Delicious food! Can't wait to order in a few hours! If you are looking for good Chinese, try it!"}
{"text":"Real spicy, really good. I've liked everything I've had there, Maos pork belly, chengdu Kung pao, Dan Dan noodles, cumin lamb. All good, this is my sole sit down Chinese joint by a long shot."}
{"text":"Coming from Baltimore, a city void of palatable Chinese food, I was very surprised (not to mention skeptical) that a great  Szechuan restaurant would be found in Pittsburgh.  I'm glad I was wrong.  The braised pork shoulder is a conversation piece, beautifully prepared and tender to the bite.  I also tried the spicy beef noodle soup and the crispy pork noodles.  If you don't like spicy, stay away, but this stuff was delicious.  I was literally sweating with elation.  Gross and wonderful at the same time.  Next time I want to try the whole fish or the hot pot.  So much to look forward too."}
{"text":"Love the authentic Szechuan cuisine as well as range of American chinese classics for those who want them.

Had my rehearsal dinner here! (Small group of 12 with chinese banquet style, they were very accommodating and easy to work with)

Veggie favorites- I love the fresh sautéed snow pea leaves (pricey at about $14) but my favorite veggie side because of their light flavor and freshness. I also love the eggplant in garlic sauce, very generous servings and just enough spice.

This place can definitely be on the spicier side but my mild spice husband loves the cumin beef and the dumplings.

Service is fast and efficient. Orange slices to end each meal :). Great neighbor Asian fix. Atmosphere is so- so with white paper on tables but overall homey with good lighting."}
{"text":"Sichuan Gourmet is legit. My wife and I frequent this place when we are hungry for something a little more authentic than the neighborhood general tsos. 

The atmosphere is authentic the special board is all in ??! 

The decorations are lacking but what they lack in design they make up for in flavor!

If you are able to read Chinese ask for the Chinese menu as it is different.

There are tvs but I have never seen one turned on so maybe not the best place to catch the game even though they have a bar area."}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food! Very delicious. I would prefer coming every day! The host and waiters are super nice!"}
{"text":"Finally some good food in Pittsburgh! We ordered the spicy beef hot pot. There were actual fresh veggies in it, including peppers and an interesting type of mushroom. The beef was tender. It was fairly spicy. A little more oily than I like, but it was a real relief to get something so fresh and authentic after a lot of Pittsburgh greasy spoon experiences!"}
{"text":"If you have never been to China this is more authentic than a place that serves General Tsao's Chicken.  If you have been to China this is not authentic.  2 stars for kind and attentive service!"}
{"text":"Don't order delivery during lunch time. They are so slow that I got my lunch for waiting about 2 hours"}
{"text":"To clear up any confusion, the new name is Sichuan Gourmet.  The restaurant was losing too much business to another China Star on Murray Ave in Greenfield. Sichuan Gourmet is authentic Sichuan.  This is the food that the Chinese G20 Delegation ate when they were in Pittsburgh.  The food is wonderful, and the service is very attentive.  I like this new location, and it looks like they will thrive in Squirrel Hill.  The Tan Tan Noodles are a great appetizer to start with.  I like the Flaming Pan dishes."}
{"text":"I think the quality of the food various. It depends on the days you go. One time I got them very spicy, the other time was super sweet, it can also be salty. I tried three times, they were all different experience. I wouldn't say it is authentic Chinese restaurant, but it is also not American Chinese restaurant. It is more like a mix. Authentic level 5/6 out of 10. But the price is fair for the portion they serve."}
{"text":"Wasn't I glad to find a place that wasn't closed on Christmas day! I would have been thankful for any place that was open and serving food when I walked in here. But, this turned out to be much more than your regular run-of-the-mill Chinese place. It was a place I'll remember for quite some time, and solely based on their food. Services and decor were fine, nothing to brag about, but nothing to complain about either. The menu was long and interesting. It has a long Chinese part and then an American one with popular dishes like Orange chicken, General Tso's chicken etc. Please do yourself a favor and order from the Chinese menu. You can stick to more conventional vegetarian, chicken, pork, beef, or fish-based dishes, or be more adventurous and try their rabbit or frog or maybe eel. I went with a spicy Chengdu style fried shrimp entree, and my husband decided to try their chef's special sweet and sour eel dish. They were both good. The sweetness of fresh tiger prawns within the spicy crunchy batter - it was indeed a delight. My only complaint was that they should have mentioned it's a completely dry dish. Having it under entrees and serving rice with it does not make too much sense. The eel was very good too. It was my first time, so I didn't know what to expect. But, I liked it a lot, and the sweet and sour curry was phenomenal and complemented the rice really well. I did not want to take any stars off since their food was so good, but this place needs to put some effort into modifying their menu book with descriptions of their dishes, or training their staff to be better able to describe their dishes."}
{"text":"In general, a pretty solid Sichuan cuisine Chinese place. It's nice to see that the establishment has opened another restaurant on Atwood, seeing as there is quite a high density of people living in South Oakland so I guess they wanted to capitalize on that. In general, food here is solid ... some of the fried stuff can be oily at times, but I'll definitely take eating here versus eating at some of the other Chinese places nearby campus (I'm looking at you, Lulu's and OE). When we came, it was actually pretty quiet, which was really quite nice. Not sure how this place at others times of the day is though. Can be a bit of a walk for those who live on campus, but certainly worth coming here as I enjoyed this place as much as the other location as well."}
{"text":"Terrible service. I ordered food home and they sent the wrong chicken and took 2 hours to deliver the correct one. I called them twice and in the middle of the conversation they hung up on me."}
{"text":"Not the best experience. When we got seated we had to wait 10 minutes just to get or server and drinks. After we ordered food my food was brought to the table while the other dish we ordered we had to wait 15 minutes. So by the time I was almost finished the second dish they brought out. There was no communication from the server what so ever. Chicken was good steam rice was cold, broccoli was cold as well. When I brought to her attantion she said that it was for decoration purposes. I guess it a good place for a tackout but it seems like they get overwhelmed with customers and 10 server."}
{"text":"The best Sichuan food in Pittsburgh. Hands down. The selection is huge, with a decent amount of vegetation options. Dishes can range from mild to \"ma la\". I have been twice and enjoyed everything I have had, though standouts are the Mao braised pork and the Chengdu jello noodles."}
{"text":"condition is wonderful through the music does not match so well.
I will try some spicy food next time"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese Squirrel Hill. I personally was not a fan of the pepper used however the portions are large enough for 2 and the food is served promptly. I was slightly disappointed that many of the items on the English menu were out [which is fine for the authentic Chinese menu]

The Tea served could have been of a better quality, however, as I was severely under the weather at this point of time, I was happy it made me feel better."}
{"text":"I came here with my parents and they were able to communicate to the waitress in Chinese as well as order from the Chinese menu. I thought it was funny that the first part of the menu showcases authentic Chinese dishes, and then the second part features Americanized Chinese dishes such as General Tso's, but this allows them to cater to everyone's taste! 

I was scared to try the Chinese dishes here at first because they have a reputation of being really spicy, but they weren't that bad! I would recommend getting a mix of spicy and non-spicy dishes for your first time - they are clearly marked on the menu, which is helpful. 

All of the dishes we ordered were all really good and tasted authentic. The service was also great and the food came out quickly. We used the 8% off check-in offer from Yelp and had no problems with it.

The Squirrel Hill location definitely looks more upscale than the Oakland one, and was well decorated. I will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"THEY HAVE HOT POT!!! I mean honest to god, authentic Szechuan hot pot. 

It's not on the normal menu, or it wasn't when last I was there, but if you ask for it, they'll haul out the Chinese menu and there you go. Ever since returning from china a long time ago, I have really craved this dish. And hot pot's not the end of it! 

This lovely, spacious restaurant features a bevy of authentic Szechuan dishes. The wait staff speak heavily accented English, but they are so friendly and inviting that it isn't uncomfortable. Once they realize you're into the good stuff, they're full of recommendations and suggested meal alterations. 

There's lots of room, but every time I've been there the tables are pretty much full. I believe there is also a big area in the back for large parties. I know where I'm going for any big shindig I have in the future!!  

I highly recommend this place for the more adventurous of you all. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"You know all those foodie shows where the host winks at the camera and tells you to ask for the other menu? Well listen to them! ASK FOR THE OTHER MENU! It's covered in amazing, authentic, delicious Sichuan food. They even have real, honest to god, mouth numbing, tongue tingling hot hot hot pot. (But only on certain days so be aware.) 

The tripe and tongue appetizer is to die for, but so is the General Tso's chicken and other Americanized Chinese dishes that your friends will be happy to eat. So you can be adventurous. 'Cause obviously, you're the adventurous one. 

They've got party rooms in the back with massive round tables and huge Lazy Susans that make sharing and sampling (eating in the traditional way) really easy.

Prices are reasonable and the service is friendly, if occasionally a bit hard to communicate with."}
{"text":"This is a modest neighborhood place, with slightly dingy décor and a somewhat tacky menu with pictures of the food.  (Rick Steves says never eat anyplace with pictures of the food.)  But, that's not the main thing.  The food is.  

Pretty extensive menu, ranging from authentic to what they call \"American\" (which underlines the fact that what we think of as Chinese food isn't real Chinese food).  I liked what I ordered, and thought the prices were reasonable.  Good, not great.  I'd definitely keep it on the list when hungry."}
{"text":"Decided to dine here after the recommendation of some locals. When we arrived on a Saturday night it was busy but we were able to get a table right away. The crowd seemed to be predominately Chinese students. They have a couple of rooms for private parties.

Coming from Philly, we've never had to pay for hot tea so that was a surprise. Stir fry vegetables was a whooping $11.99! If you're looking for some authentic Chinese food, you can find it here but you'll pay the price. We got a few dishes to share and they were flavorful but pretty oily."}
{"text":"This is a good little spot for Chinese. They recently remodeled the place. I love how they always have the Yelp coupons! Staff is friendly and the atmosphere is nice. I like how they offer online ordering. My personal favorites here are General Tso's and Beef w Broccoli. Also the location is prime... right on the 61C bus line."}
{"text":"In all my years in Oakland, I never wandered in here until recently I found a groupon and took a friend for lunch. The place is spacious with a bar and plenty of tables. The staff was very friendly and they have a very large menu. I went with the spicy crispy chicken meal and really enjoyed it! The flavor was fantastic and the portion size was enough for two lunches. I sampled my friend's tofu dish as well, and it was also very good.

Another great perk, is when most places are packed for lunch on Forbes Ave, a short walk down Atwood will have you hear and more availability for seating."}
{"text":"Good service and authentic food. It is hard to find anything good that is not overpriced in Pittsburgh. But for this restaurant it is well worth the money. Would like to come back in the future :)"}
{"text":"I visited Sichuan Gourmet with a friend for lunch last Sun. at 1pm.  Having heard that the food there is quite authentic, and given that my friend is Chinese, I suggested that we check it out.  After a bit of confusion regarding the location (she initially thought I meant the one on Atwood in Oakland, rather than the one on Murray in Squirrel Hill), we met there and were seated.

Having perused previous reviews, I knew that the best dishes here were on the authentic menu, so I decided to order one of them.  Although I'd originally planned to order a spicy Sichuan dish despite some trepidation concerning the spice level (I enjoy some heat but not a huge amount), I decided to order the duck noodle soup ($10).  In a similar vein, my friend ordered the beef ho fun noodle ($10).  The noodle soup consisted of a bowl of duck flavored soup containing pieces of bone-in duck (noted on the menu), cabbage, and udon noodles.  Despite its thinness, the soup was quite flavorful, and the duck and cabbage were well-cooked--not under- or overdone.  I only encountered a few pieces of bone in the meat, which I was easily able to avoid.  Because I'm not a beef eater, I didn't sample my friend's ho fun, but it looked similar to a Singaporean dish known as char kway teow which is usually made with pork.  Although she expected it to be spicy (it wasn't), she enjoyed it and finished the entire serving.

Service was rather slow and inattentive.  Fortunately, this wasn't an issue for us as we didn't have any pressing time constraints, but keep this in mind if you choose to eat in.  The decor was more upscale than that of a typical Chinese restaurant, and the prices reflected this.  During our visit, no lunch specials were offered, and most of the prices were somewhat higher than I prefer to pay for lunch (our dishes were among the least expensive on the menu.)  Despite these shortcomings, we enjoyed our lunch, and I'd be willing to return--though next time, I'd probably go for dinner instead, as I believe the prices are the same. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Yum!  My dad and I wanted to plan a quick adventure into Pittsburgh, and wanted Asian food while we were in the city.  My friend the lovely Angel I. (currently of Washington DC) recommended Sichuan Gourmet and the Squirrel Hill area, which was a very good choice.

There's an easy paid parking lot behind the building, and there were a bunch of open tables available at noon. Our server wasn't the fastest, but she was very nice and quite helpful.  They have a huge menu, including authentic dishes, Americanized items, and a lunch menu.  All seemed pretty reasonably priced.  We tried:
--lunch combo hot and sour soup: delicious, if thinner and different than most I've tried in the past.  It seemed to be a thinner broth with less cornstarch, and had mushrooms and more vegetables.  Very good.
--lunch combo fried rice: great as well.  more vegetables than most, and not greasy or dry.
--sichuan dumpling in red chili oil: very hard to eat with chopsticks, but great-- tasty filling in a very spicy sauce.
--Mongolian beef, extra spicy: my dad ordered this because Mongolian beef is his favorite, and he doesn't get Chinese too often.  This was delicious.  The beef was perfectly cooked and they nailed the \"extra spicy\" request.  He had plenty of heat without losing any flavor.
--Chicken and eggplant with spicy garlic sauce:  actually one of the best Chinese dishes I've had, ever.  The eggplant practically melted in your mouth, and the sauce was spicy with the sweetness garlic gets if you cook it just right. So good.

I'm not sure when I'll next make it out of Greensburg, but I might have tovisit Sichuan Gourmet when I do!"}
{"text":"Sichuan Gourmet is fantastic if you're looking for what I'm told is authentic Sichuan food.

I've only ever ordered from the Chinese menu. Be prepared for heat. Everything I've had has been extremely spicy.

My recommendation is the dry fried chicken. Wow is it spicy.

The service is fantastic and the staff will work with you if you have questions about a dish."}
{"text":"I ordered youngchow fried rice, egg rolls and thin rice noodles,  everything is so delicious. Im very picky when it comes to fried rice, but this place makes a very good one; rice is soft and seasoning is just perfect. Service is nice too. Will definitely reorder"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese cuisine and on time delivery!  A bit on the pricey end."}
{"text":"I've only been for the lunch menu, but it is cheap and generous in portions. I've tried a couple things and all has been exactly as expected.
My only complaint it is a little slow sometimes. Not the best place if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. Unless you are familiar with Chinese food it's a bit difficult to know what to get. The dishes are large and tasty but definitely expensive for Chinese food."}
{"text":"The only legit Szechuan and probably the best Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. The whole spicy fish is masterful, even the skin submerged in a puddle of chili oil was crispy, and the entire dish has layers upon layers of flavor. I'd put many if not all of the dishes here up against Philadelphia's Han Dynasty's equivalents - spicy cucumbers, ma po tofu, dan dan noodles - without fear of upturned noses from the food snooting crowd, and I worship Han Dynasty. SG even has better-than-usual versions of American-Chinese standards for the picky eating crowd, so they can feel safe while you sneak explosively flavored chunks of things into their wary pie holes, expanding their meager horizons. I can't wait for the next trendy regional Chinese cuisine to hit PGH - Yinzer Xi'an."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious Xi'an food I have ever eaten in the states. It's soooooo good! Make me wanna move in Pittsburgh?"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Sorry I was not impressed. I like Chinese food, I grew up loving Jimmy Tsang's. It was an evening out with a friend. We had a discount certificate for dinner that night and decided to give it a try, being that neither of us had been there before.  We didn't have trouble parking, we wanted to shop in Giant Eagle after dinner, so we parked in the grocery store lot. We walked in to find a hostess waiting at the door. She handed us both a menu and showed us to a table. We were only one of two tables in the restaurant that night. We ordered from the menus given to us, but when the order came to the table, my friend noticed the seafood was missing from her dish. The server told us that we were given the wrong menus. It was clearly a mistake on their part. The server hesitated on make compensation, she went to take the dish away, but we insisted that she just bring the seafood out on a new plate, who knows how long it would take to have the plate brought back. After talking to a manager it appeared to be, showing him the menus that she gave us, she return to the kitchen for the seafood to put into her dish. We were not compensated for their mistake. Overall the food was good. The tea was excellent, I can remember ordering another pot, before the night ended, because we did not receive any refill on our glasses of water. The service was very slow, but friendly. I am not sure I would return. I might try the Oakland restaurant instead."}
{"text":"I don't know if I just ate there when they first opened up and didn't have their sh*t together, but it boggles my mind that this place has gotten so many great reviews!  The service was HORRIBLE.  Our server basically ignored us, never refilling drinks or asking how the meal was, which made sense, since she ignored us while we were ordering anyway.  Wrong appetizer and missing chicken from the sesame noodles...with chicken.  The Pacific Rim was much better!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were passing through Pittsburgh on our way from DC. We stopped here based on multiple reviews. Do not pass this place by!! Worth the detour or for locals, a great casual place for a great meal!"}
{"text":"We ordered online from Beyond Menu.  They apparently cancelled the order because, although according to the app we are within the delivery area, the driver disagreed.  Although they had both my phone number and my husband's, no-one bothered to contact us.  It was only after I waited for more than an hour and checked e-mail for status that I discovered it had been cancelled.  So here I am at 8:30 at night without dinner and royally pi**ed off.  I called BM and was basically told so sad too bad.  No help from anyone.  I will not be frequenting this restaurant or BM again.  Chengdu Gourmet will get my business.  I know they deliver to me."}
{"text":"I came here (oakland one) because i was craving some sichuan food. The waiter was rude and the food was too salty."}
{"text":"Came here with my father because he'd been craving Chinese food. This was my first time here and had a $5 off coupon. First impressions were good. Was greeted right away and promptly seated. It's an ample sized restaurant and was pretty clean. 

The service was pretty slow for the number of ppl in the restaurant. Thought we would've gotten our food a lot faster since there weren't a lot of patrons, but we waited a while. So much so, I had to ask a few times whether our food would come out. Our appetizer came out after our main dish. And our side came out when we were basically done eating. Needless to say, everything felt a bit disjointed. The food was fine, but not stand out, though the string beans w minced pork was quite tasty.

I'd give them another try if I'm in the area, but probably won't go out of way to eat there again."}
{"text":"This is the beeessttt Chinese cusine I have ever had in Pittsburgh. Highly recommanded!!!"}
{"text":"Best place on the planet.

And I've been well around the planet.

They're always coming through with the raw chilies, too. Much love x1001!"}

Ghastly meal! An egg roll and a dish called \"triple fairy\" were delivered. The egg roll was less flavorful than a frozen one from Giant Eagle. I was already suspicious -- if a Chinese restaurant can't make a decent egg roll, then you know it's bad.

The Triple Fairy -- that was the outrageous thing. The \"triple\" referred to a mixture of chicken, scallops & shrimp that were supposed to be mixed with vegetables and a light sauce.

What arrived was a disgusting mess of HUGE tough broccoli spears, giant chunks of green pepper, and big stringy snow peas with brown spots that looked like insect bites. The vegetables were way too big to put in your mouth without cutting them up. And of course the inevitable baby corn. The scallops were the texture of pencil erasers, the shrimp was totally overcooked, and whatever the sauce was had no discernible taste at all.

I actually ate a couple of shrimp & scallops, a mushroom or two, and threw the rest in the garbage.

Sixteen dollars down the trash chute. Learn from my experience."}
{"text":"Ok I can't believe they actually list that they do delivery....2 hours for 2 lunches and no show? Had to call grub hub to cancel. This is about the Oakland location by the way...Their phone number listed is a dial tone but after the 7th time calling I was able to get to a lady who barely spoke English and got my order confused with someone else. When I told her what I got she said \"oh yeah yeah it's out for delivery\".....uhhh highly doubtful. 40 minutes after that call nothing. Love starving to death before an 8 hour shift at work because of a lunch no show! No time to even prepare something else to eat!"}
{"text":"Most of you guys know that I'm a How Lee devotee, but upon the insistence of Jarrett H, I finally tried China Star (now known as Sichuan Gourmet).  Jarrett-- thank you!! The food here is fresh and delicious, and they use less oil than How Lee. Now, don't get me wrong, I still heart How Lee, but it's nice to be able to mix it up a little bit. I've had the frogs legs & multiple noodle dishes: all good. I'm not a fan of some offerings (dumplings, spring roll, and crab rangoon), and ordering over the phone can be exacerbating. I've also had to convince them that, despite being white, I'm OK with bone-in meat, spice and \"weird\" meats. Once convinced, the employees seem to be genuinely enthusiastic  that I'm trying more traditional Chinese dishes. (Ethnic food places not believing me about spice level and meat choice is another topic and tangent I shall not engage here.) 
  All in all, though, I'm happy to have another delicious Chinese restaurant in my rotation, and can't wait to actually dine in there rather than carryout or delivery."}
{"text":"The food was good, but too oily.
The service was absolutely horrific. My boyfriend and I went there around 2 pm, and the restaurant was empty. I asked for recommendation on their lunch special, yet the waitress told me that she didn't have any recommendations on these, because these were cheap food. She could only suggest something from the main menu. She was very condescending, and did not bother to apologize when she knocked over things on the table. She never bothered to come over during the meal, and we had to ask a few times to refill our water. Again, it was at 2pm while nobody was in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese restaurant. As a Chinese, I very suggest you guys to try. It not only has Chinese food which match Americans, but it also has very wonderful Chinese food like domestic Chinese food. I often take my friends to there, most of them like the food. In addition, the price of the food is not expensive and the amount of each dish is enough."}
{"text":"I might give it another try and order differently, but based on my initial experience, I can't say I was impressed.  We headed out to see what they had to offer since we are still looking for a good takeout place.  They handed us a lengthy menu, with an additional page of specials.  Turns out those specials aren't all that special...and they don't even actually carry them all year round.  We also noticed that the menu was divided into a Szechuan menu and an American menu.  I appreciate the attempt to cater to American tastes and all, but stuffing an afterthought in the back of your menu book isn't really all that awesome.  

My boyfriend got over being teased by two eel dishes on the special menu and settled on the General Tso Chicken, an eggroll, and some crab rangoons. Now, I know that these aren't traditional Szechuan dishes, but if you are going to offer them, you should do it right.  This was all wrong.  The eggroll was passable.  The rangoons were a little chewy and not really all that great.  The General Tsos was a travesty.  It actually reminded me of one of those dinner in a bag things you get at the Giant Eagle across the street.  It was super sweet...not at all crispy...and not at all spicy.  So disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm really hesitant to give this what I think it should be (2 stars max), so I'll set it at 3.
The fact of the matter is, for the quality of the food you're getting (which is mediocre Sichuan cuisine), you are paying exorbitant prices ($15+/dish? really?). Granted, it's Pittsburgh, so it's hard to compare the food to places where the Asian density is higher, but still...

1) Chongqing la zi ji. Not horrible, but lacking the spice omph that it typically has. This version is breaded; the Chengdu one is not.
2) Beef bao. Not good at all, avoid this - it's tasteless and a very simple, uninspired stew.
3) Beef tendon, cold. Actually really nicely prepared, I'd recommend this one - nice balance of ingredients + peppercorn + chili.
4) Water-boiled fish. This dish is a disgrace to the real dish - its not served properly, almost no peppercorns are used, and it seems to be using some pre-made spice ingredient + way too much starch.
5) Pork shoulder. Not sure what the exact name of it was called, but it was actually pretty good - though I say that as it wasn't really a restaurant style dish but more homemade.

Service is nothing to yell about, and 5% cash payment discount. Sorry Pittsburgh, I hope you find better! (The N. Hills location used to be, but I haven't been in forever!)"}
{"text":"We are from the Washington DC area--not a hot spot for Chinese unfortunately--but were very happy with our meal here.  The Braised Pork Shoulder in Mild Spices* was absolutely awesome, tangy and wonderfully fatty.  The ma la pepper-spiced cold bamboo shoots salad was spicy and delicious as well.  The ma la or Sichuan peppercorn (which is really another plant and not a true peppercorn) has that very unusual spicy and numbing that I vacilate from liking and not liking, but ultimately think that anyone who likes spicy, hot food should try."}
{"text":"Very spicy and very delicious. Although I feel that the Sq. Hill location gives a much more authentic experience."}
{"text":"Watery!  Unless I have eaten a disguised Sichuan dinner that is not authentic, the sichuan here is truly disappointing.  Watery, watery, watery.  I won't be going back.  The hostess was a sour one too!  Not hospitable at all."}
{"text":"we used to really like this place, but I went there recently with a large party, and whoo-hoo.  the only bad dish we could have called, something like tofu with bland sauce, for an unadventursome vegetarian in our group.  the rest of the 8 or so dishes were good, spicy or flavorful, and did not seem salty or too greasy.  we would go back, but we don't get in the area much these days.   the honey walnut shrimp was a surprise, but ok.  it was a surprise in that the sauce was dark and not light like we have had elsewhere. they take reservations.  parking is best around behind them in a lot."}
{"text":"A few days ago I saw a picture of their Pork Belly from a friend's instagram picture. Ever since, I've gone through their Yelp Reviews/pictures numerous times and been trying to find an excuse to come to this side of the town. We finally made it a point to stop here for dinner yesterday since I already had some work in Shadyside.

For a weeknight the place was pretty busy and diverse. Despite the chinese fast food appearance from outside, the inside was neatly decorated with a mix of industrial design and asian decor. There's also some private rooms for larger groups.

The menu has 2 main parts Traditional and American Chinese. The American Chinese Menu consists of General Tso, Lo Mein etc. the usual suspect. However, the Traditional Menu has all sort of stuffs that you probably may/may not have heard/seen before and is a bit overwhelming to go through the list at first.

We went with the Chinese Menu and ordered the Mao's Pork Belly (as first seen on my friend's IG), Chengdu Chicken and Tofu with Egg Plant. As an appetizer, we got the Egg Drop Soup and Crab Rangoon. The Egg Drop Soup was better than your normal chinese restaurant - however, the crab rangoon although really good was very oily. 
The Pork Belly ... the only reason I've been craving come here.. was bit of a disappointment. It was just okay.. not as good as I was expecting. However, the Chengdu Chicken and Tofu were both really good. FYI: The chendu Chicken is a dry dish (to give you an example: Chicken Nuggets mixed with a whole lot of dry red chillies) not something ideal to eat with rice. So, make sure to get something else too.

Overall, the food was good. The service was a bit slow but the older grand ma lady (serving water) was very friendly, attentive and quick at getting us water and tea although she hardly spoke english.

I would definitely come back again and give another dish a try from the chinese Menu. Also, it's a BYOB."}
{"text":"While I am not a huge American-Chinese food eater, I have always wanted to try authentic Szechuan cuisine.  However, when I picked up a cold earlier this week, I just wanted some shrimp lo mein ($8.50) so I came here for takeout.

The restaurant has that very American-Chinese vibe if you eat-in, and the takeout was super quick.  The food was ready in about ten minutes.  Sadly, the Lo Mein and eggrolls I ordered were not good at all.  As other reviewers have complained, the Lo Mein was greasy and tasteless.  There was virtually no shrimp and tons of onions.  Thank God I ordered takeout because it needed some serious sriracha sauce.  After eating the Lo Mein, I really won't go back for the authentic menu.  It just wasn't good.

The major redeeming point was the service.  The food was quick, and the employees were friendly.

Credit accepted but cash discount!"}
{"text":"Everything was nuanced and well-priced. The roasted garlic in the chili dumplings was delicious, and the dan dan mien and sesame noodles were tender and seasoned impeccably. Delivery was quick and efficient. Not sure what happened with the 8% discount."}
{"text":"I was actually skeptical coming here. As soon as we went in, I felt the heat since they didn't turn on the AC or turned it on really low. Therefore, I was uncomfortable the whole time. That should have been the first sign! We were served quickly and we ordered a dish of tendon, some veggies and sweet and sour spare ribs. The tendon and the veggies were pretty good! The tendon was spicy and had s ton of flavor. My favorite dish were the veggies! I love garlic and this dish just had lots of it. On the other hand, I was extremely disappointed in the sweet and sour spare ribs. It was seriously not what I thought it would be. The meat was overlooked and I hated the flavor. We quickly dined and left as I was uncomfortable with the environment and did not like the taste of the water. I'm not sure if I feel as the meal was worth the money but you can definitely find other places with better quality."}
{"text":"This location is WAY better than the one in Oakland. The place was nicely decorated and felt elegant. The place was packed when we came here for dinner. Although the food is a bit pricier than Chinese restaurants around, it's worth it. We got soup and two main dishes. The food is pretty good and comes out quick! Definitely recommend looking at the pictures to order if you don't know what you want."}
{"text":"This has got to be not only the best  Sichuan restaurant in Pittsburgh but the best Chinese! Everything they make is excellent.Of course they're masters of Sichuan food but now I've learned they're aces at Xian cooking as well.I ordered the Xian hand pulled noodles in chili oil and they're the best I've ever had. I am in Flushing Queens a few times a year and I've ordered these noodles from all the Bourdain and Zimmern recommended places and they don't hold a candle to the plate of noodles I've just been eating.You can tell they're truly handmade  and their slightly chewy texture is just right! Oh I got so excited I almost forgot to say how their cumin lamb totally smokes the competition.They give you so much lamb and its texture is just right almost tender inside and crisp outside.It leaves Chengdu Gourmet ' s version in the dust. Anyone who loves Chinese food and Sichuan food in particular has got to get themselves to the Oakland location of Sichuan Gourmet pronto!"}
{"text":"This place has some extremely authentic food and it actually feels authentic inside. However, I believe it's a bit pricey for the servings they give and I wouldn't say the food stands out. It's service is also subpar and can be not the most professional. However, good place for a casual dinner out with friends!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Nice spacious restaurant decorated with a mix of old-world and asian influences. It was good sign all the servers spoke mandarin and 80% of the customers were asians. The place was half-full when we came and it wasn't too noisy. Staff was slightly on the slower side but not egregiously so, just some 3-5 minute waits to order, water refills, check, etc but consistently so.

Food: We got the beef in spicy sauce in sichuan style and kung-pao chicken and both were quite delicious. The meat in both dishes was tender, well-sauced, and the vegetables were cooked to that perfect balance between softened and still slightly-crunchy. The dishes were savory and not too salty but I found the heat a little lacking. The dishes looked intimidating consider the volume of chinese (tsin tsin) red peppers they use but they are actually fairly mild. Along with the sichuan peppercorns, the dishes tend to have a more numbing tongue-buzzing effect than really imparting any true heat (think mild-moderate jalapeno in terms of heat).

Overall, Sichuan Gourmet is the real deal. They've dialed down their heat for the american audience but their flavors are otherwise quite authentic. The entrees are on the expensive side ($13-15) but they're served family style and 2 dishes is enough to feed 3 people. I'd definitely give this place a shot."}
{"text":"Our weeknight dinner here was a mixed experience.  We were treated to very closely attended service on a slow Thursday night, as we ordered the FISH FILLET WITH PICKLED SOUR VEG SOUP, CHENGDU SLICED PORK BELLY, and PAN FRIED HOT PEPPERS.  After our first two dishes came out, we were informed that the kitchen was out of peppers, and we selected the CHINESE EGGPLANT IN GARLIC SAUCE instead.  We complemented our meals with hot tea and a Blue Moon.

The hot soup was super comforting on a single degree-temperature night--not too sour and full of sliced tilapia fillets.  We dug into the huge bowl but still managed to take about 1/3 of it home with us.  However, I wish it had been spicy as the menu indicated (and as the server \"warned\" us about).  Too bad.  The pork belly was thinly sliced beautifully and stir fried with leeks.  I'm not sure how this dish differs from the DOUBLE COOKED PORK BELLY we've ordered in the past, as it looked and tasted exactly the same, but it was satisfying nonetheless.  The second-choice eggplant, however, was a huge disappointment.  It appeared wonderfully saucy and flavorful, but past the outside coating, the inside of each piece was completely bland.  Perhaps it had been flash fried too quickly for any flavor to soak in, as the dish came out about 3 minutes after we ordered it.  My SO and I both nibbled at a piece before completely giving up on the dish.  We asked the waitress not to box it up, stating that we didn't enjoy it, but sadly they charged us for it anyway.  That's fine, I suppose, I've learned not to expect great service from a Chinese restaurant.

Sigh, overall, my meal was enjoyable, mainly because it's hard for me to eat Chinese food and NOT enjoy it.  Nothing that happened tonight was a dealbreaker--just a lot of tiny irksome things that brought Sichuan Gourmet a notch lower in my mind.  I guess when you're one of the few \"authentic\" restaurants in this Sichuan wasteland, there is sadly little incentive to raise the bar."}
{"text":"As hopelessly overpriced as the other authentic Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh, because, I guess they figure they can be.  But Sichuan Gourmet definitely hits the spot for my (constant) craving for spicy Asian goodness.

I've been here a couple times in the past year, most recently for Saturday lunch with a party of 3.  This location was BUMPIN'--I was almost worried upon walking in that I hadn't made a reservation, but they were able to seat us right away in the pretty much full dining room.  (Full with like, 95% Asians, I might add--always a good sign in a place like this.)  Service was slow and harried throughout our meal--it would have been an issue had we been in any sort of hurry.

We ordered the CHINESE BROCCOLI QUICK-FRIED IN BLACK PEPPER, MULTI-MUSHROOM W. VEGETABLES IN FLAMING PAN, LAMB IN SPICY SAUCE SICHUAN STYLE, and a SMOKED PORK BELLY that was on special but turned out to be pretty much the standard double cooked pork in a black bean sauce.

There wasn't anything I wouldn't order again.  The Chinese broccoli was crisp with a great balance of mala flavor, the mushrooms in the flaming pan were meaty and umami (though that dish turned out much smaller than expected), and the flavors for both meat dishes were oh so delectable.  Everything was swimming in much more oil than I would have liked, which was the only thing that kept it from tasting completely like home.  But yes, this place will do for satisfying my Sichuan itch in Pittsburgh.  If it weren't for the price gouging, I'd be back much more often."}
{"text":"It tastes really authentic.  Love a lot of dishes here.  Not as spicy though, but good to hang out with American friend."}
{"text":"Nobody seemed to know how to redeem? a Groupon voucher. Service was mediocre?, but our meal was well-executed. Wouldn't bother going again."}
{"text":"I'm from Shanghai, China. I have to admit Sichuan Gourmet provides genuine Sichuan Style food, and it's one of my best hang out place. The price is moderate. And they can accommodate large crowd as other traditional Chinese restaurant. It can get quite crowded in weekend nights so come early is my advice. In all, if you want some hot and spicy food, this is your best shot in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Went out with a friend after searching for a decent Chinese place to eat in town. Food is just awesome. The menu selection is quite good. Ambience inside is great.

Cons: Parking is an issue on weekdays. Paid parking available but generally filled up. Waiters struggle in understanding you if some customization to the food is needed."}
{"text":"Alright I think I finally realized why I didn't like Sichuan gourmet the first time. You just have to go to the right one! DON'T go to the one in Oakland. This one is sooooo much better. It's much cleaner and the service is better as well. The menu seems to be more comprehensive to me too and is divided into Chinese and American styles. Some of the food we had were even authentic enough to remind me of dishes I had in China. Also, I'm in absolute love with their fried pork intestines now and before today I had always avoided eating visceral stuff. This is such a game changer."}
{"text":"I've heard many good things about this restaurant and finally decided to try it. I was kind of disappointed and would have to say this place is overrated. But to be fair we only ordered two dishes so maybe they weren't very representative? I didn't expect the spicy fish fillet to be fried as it wasn't mentioned on the menu and it's not how this dish is typically made. And seriously, why is every single Chinese dish I've had in Pittsburgh SO GREASY?? I literally walk out feeling kind of disgusting every time and this place is no exception."}
{"text":"I tend not to expect too much from the chinese cuisine scene in Pittsburgh, but the new Sichuan Gourmet definitely exceeded my expectations and hopefully may start a new trend for other asian restaurants to follow. 

The food is close enough to the authentic dishes I enjoy every now and then when I return to China, however I find that the spicyness is a little off; I can't really explain it and all I can say is that it's not quite \"Sichuan\" spicy.

The looks and layout of the restaurant were more presentable than most other restaurants. My only qualm here was that they didn't have an actual round table for large groups. I myself came with a party of 8, and there was one large rectangular table in the back. No way of rotating dishes either so it was really hard to do the usual family style. 

Looking at the menu shows that dishes are quite pricey, however once the dishes arrive you'll understand why. Portions are huge, probably serving 2-3 per plate for most dishes. 

I personally enjoyed the cumin lamb a lot. It did seem like a good part of it was just fat, but the spices used were perfect. I also enjoyed the A1 appetizer, I forget the English name, but that's usually a standard dish you get at spicy Sichuan restaurants. 

This place just needs to turn it up a notch with the spicy.

Overall great experience. Looking forward to satisfying my Sichuan cravings here in the future."}
{"text":"Food is awesome. I don't come here often because sometimes I dread that the waitresses speak to me in Mandarin and I have to explain to them that I can speak Cantonese only and they would look at me like \"what's wrong with you?\" Haha, but that's my problem that I have never learned to speak Mandarin and this issue should not apply to most patrons here. Service is hit or miss just like many Chinese restaurants. It is slightly more expensive than it should be but there is not much competition in Pittsburgh. Overall, a pretty good place."}
{"text":"Jason is fabulous! Food is served quickly and the staff is very nice!! Reasonably priced and in the heart of Oakland. College area but the food is great!"}
{"text":"This original Sichuan Gourmet recently renovated their interior, and they now look more like the second location in Oakland. The decor is more earthy, wooden, and dimly lit, as opposed to the bright reds that were all over the walls in the original layout. The main menu and service haven't changed too much, though they're starting to add more special or seasonal items, many of which are listed on the blackboard at the front. Recently we stopped in and had a warm, hearty lamb noodle soup. While this isn't a Sichuan item, it was absolutely perfect for a cold winter day, since it's more characteristic of a northern China soup. It may not be for everyone, since these are not clean cuts of lamb, but if you can pick through the bones then it will leave you feeling toasty and satisfied."}
{"text":"This is probably still one of the best places to get Sichuanese food in Oakland, and while the quality does vary a bit from time to time, they are way up there in terms of authenticity and taste. Here I want to point out the recent Shaanxi offerings, as they have hired a new chef who specializes in western Chinese food. So you might see some new items tacked on to their regular menu (though all in Chinese last I checked). As far as I know this is one of the only places in Pittsburgh that offers Shaanxi cuisine, not to mention so discreetly in a Sichuan restaurant. So far we've tried the burger (???), cold skin noodles (??), hot oil noodles (???), and minced noodles (???). (Btw all these English translations are by no means official, and you'll probably do better communicating in Chinese or via pictures.)

The first two were very comparable to what I've had at Xi'an Famous Foods in NYC. The burger is stuffed to the brim with meat, which is deliciously seasoned and very tender. The cold skin noodles come in a smaller plate than the latter two but is overflowing with flavor, particularly spicy and vinegary. It also has a bunch of different textures from the spongy noodle to the cucumber and bean sprouts. The hot oil noodles feel a bit similar, but both the noodles and the preparation are quite different. Here the noodles are a lot thicker and more chewy, and the toppings include a lot of chopped up scallion and chili, but the main thing is of course the hot oil at the bottom whose flavor is absorbed by the noodles. Finally, the minced noodles is a whole different thing entirely, as it is soup based and much less spicy; the noodles used are the usual stringy kind, and the bowl is filled with the signature chopped up veggies, garnishes, and minced meat. The broth provides the flavor, and the toppings provide the texture!"}
{"text":"Great food, although a bit oily. They were super nice and kept the kitchen open a bit late for us. Also they let us use our Yelp deal. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I've never really had authentic chinese food, and I'm as guilty as they come as far as loving my americanized general tso's and egg rolls. However, authentic Sichuan, with it's allure of numbing spiciness, has had me wanting to try it out for a while now. So while we waited for our one-hour photos to finish at Costco, we ran up here to give this place a shot.

We walked in to grab takeout and the guy at the front desk seemed American born and fluent in both English and Mandarin(Not that I know what fluent Mandarin sounds like, mind you), so consider your complicated phone orders A-OK with this place. We started to look at the menu and were disappointed at the choices - it seemed to be a normal chinese place with a few additions here and there. As I was about to choose a dish, though, the guy mentions that there are in fact two different menus, and that if we're feeling adventurous we should look off the black menu. 

Of course, this is what I had been looking for - and of course it was no easier to make a selection off the hundred or so brief descriptions. I finally asked the guy what would give me my fix of Sichuan heat and he immediately recommended the Chongqing Chicken($12.95), describing it at simply chicken mixed in with a heaping pile of peppers, sounded right up my alley. My friend got Shredded Potato in a spicy sauce($9.95), and my girlfriend got tofu noodle soup($7.95) - which they accommodated her complicated order of no sesame oil, sesame seeds, or nuts by going back to the kitchen and ensuring it could be done first. Our food was ready in about 10 minutes.

When I finally got around to eating the chicken, it was exactly as I had hoped - peppers outnumbered chicken in this dish by far, and the heat was amazing. Pure mouth-numbing bliss, and the flavors of the dish itself were outstanding. But seriously, the heat was what I was after and the heat I got, and as I took breaks from eating I was sweating and my tongue felt like it got shot up with novocain.

The shredded potato dish was fairly tasty for the little I tried, and the tofu noodle soup was a bit bland in my opinion - by we also ordered it with a water base instead of a chicken-stock base, which is probably the reason. 

The China Star is an awesome place to go try out some real Chinese food. I don't know if this place will replace my General Tso's habits, but I can't wait to come back and start to work my way through some more items on this menu."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch and had a simple request Sautéed broccoli they refused to make it although it was in several dishes and on the menu .....I understand if I would have ordered something unreasonable but broccoli? ...also it seems very overpriced.....moving on"}
{"text":"Had the cumin lamb, beef tongue and tripe and fish in spicy broth.  All were excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good authentic Chinese food! My Chinese friend actually took me here and ordered all the dishes. I knew I would be in for a treat when I saw the whole menu was in Mandarin and all the servers as well as the surrounding diners were Chinese. 

We had the cold sliced beef app and I never had anything like this---actually pretty tasty. They serve it with a dry pepper mix on the side that you then sprinkle to your own liking right on the beef. Next, we shared a hot pan dish of pork which was delicious and pretty spicy. We also got chicken and that was good too. These portions are family style so if you order one per person, expect to bring home leftovers.

Great meal through and through. I saw many diners order bubble tea here; I wish I had a chance to try it! So that seems very popular. Oh, and don't forget to check in on yelp to get a discount off your bill :)"}
{"text":"I have passed by this place several hundred times a year , and never stopped here, UNTIL TONIGHT !
I was very surprised and impressed at the extensive menu.This restaurant surely has something for every taste.
 I decided to try the 3 pepper chicken. I like very spicy food and this dish hit the spot. Not only was it delicious , but it even filled my big tummy. Excellent staff , very fast & friendly. Very authentic and enjoyable.
Sometimes you just have to treat yourself to the best. I recommend treating yourself to Sichuan Gourmet."}
{"text":"We came here because I had a local flavor coupon. We were seated right away around 5:50 and the place quickly filled up. I ordered the general tso's DARK MEAT. I must say it was the best I've ever had besides a few mushy pieces. The all white meat General tso's, tried by everyone was not very good. Very dry. My problem mostly was the pricing. If you order a soft drink they are a whopping $1.75 and you get a 12 oz can with no refill!! My other friends got hot tea and when it was empty they just put more hot water in with no new teabag. My wife got the shrimp and it was just okay. The flavor was a little off. Also the the orders came out slowly, 45-50 minutes. I don't think I would come back to dine, maybe just take out for general tso's chicken."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food. Not very authentic if compared with the food in China. But still good enough. Make me miss home!"}
{"text":"I think How Lee is better, because Sichuan gourmet has changed its chief cook. I really hope that guy could be back."}
{"text":"Finally, a good Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh! Even the decor and ambiance seems authentic, with the family-style tables, paper tablecloths, and slightly sticky seats. 

The food is top notch--we ordered from the Chinese menu (rather than the \"American\" menu) and were thrilled with our dishes. I had shredded pork in garlic sauce and my husband had some sort of duck with Devil's Tongue yams. Oh actually, I suppose I did order from the American menu: I got a cup of hot and sour soup and loved it. Perfect for a cold night. 

The waiter was terrific--he gave our 6-month-old a fortune cookie wrapped in crinkly plastic, which kept her entertained for quite awhile. 

By the time we left around 6:30 on a weeknight, there was a decent crowd, and all seemed to be enjoying themselves. We're looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Sichuan restaurant- by far my favorite in Pittsburgh. I really like the spiciness of the dishes and they use real Sichuan peppercorns, which have an almost numbing property. Our favorite dishes are the three pepper chicken, the broccoli with black pepper (which actually has red chilis and Sichuan peppercorns), the spicy wontons in red oil, the kung pao chicken. The mapo tofu is also very good. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Waitresses are very polite. But the food is horrible. Everything we ordered had a massive amount of salt which made our tongue burn. Completely inedible. Moreover the main course was served before the appetizer and we had to remind them of the soup we had ordered. Won't visit again. Won't recommend either"}
{"text":"We had the mapo tofu with fish, the hor fun with shrimp (not on the menu but they'll make it upon request) and another fried prawn dish. The hor fun was not in gravy- it was their own version- but still good. The prawns were really delicious and the mapo tofu perfect. Would definitely go again. Paid about $11/person."}
{"text":"Wow! 3 times here and I'm smitten. Growing up, we would go to Jimmy Tsang's for large special family events. Sichuan Gourmet may be its replacement in my book. Their menu is very well adorned and organized with photos too! We've had sizzling fish, tea duck, garlic scallops, wonton soup, and a dish with  beef and chicken I'm not sure his Dad got and we've loved it ALL! And the service! Amazing! Tonight they were really moving and had several tables waiting, I was glad to see, such a great place. We will definitely keep coming back !"}
{"text":"Recently, Pacific Ring up at Squirrel Hill got replaced by China Star, which is now a Si Chuan restaurant. I will say that I am extremely biased because I love Si Chuan food, so that's that. The restaurant is also newly renovated, and I think the interior design looks a lot less gloomier compared to before. Anyway, we ended up ordering  (Cold Beef Brisket and tripe),  (Stir fried spicy chicken),  (Fish in hot oil), and  (Squash and mushrooms).

The dishes turned out to be amazing, although somewhat salty. They were definitely generous on the spices, and I thought they tasted pretty authentic. I feel like this is a restaurant that I would go to regularly with my family in Taiwan, and that says a lot. It could be spicier though... I've definitely had spicier Si Chuan food, but I think it was enough for the people I was eating it with. I have yet to find another Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh to offer the squash (in the last dish) so I was really excited. I think the meal was amazing and I would definitely go back again, even if the prices are all $10+."}
{"text":"Food is clearly a 4 star- great flavors and finally acceptable Dan Dan noodles in Pittsburgh! I loved all the dishes I've gotten from there, and I've only had it through delivery. Scallion pancake was great, so was the Crispy Spicy Chicken.

The delivery service sucks, though. I gotten a confirmed time of 45 minutes the first time, and the delivery coming a little after 1:15 hrs later (no mention, no apology). The second time, the food came in the 45-60 minute window, but it all arrived cold except the rice, which sucks because the chicken got soggy. This is all during non-peak times- before 5 PM, and clearly before dinner rush. 

Maybe I will stop by for dine-in, but skip the delivery."}
{"text":"The food is really authentic- it really was like the food I was craving from Chengdu when I visited a few years ago. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be (no peppercorn bombs), but there was definitely a kick, but not enough to totally numb your tongue, which is good. 

The food is spicy and greasy- that's just how it is. I like the Flaming Pot dishes because I like eating my spicy food really hot as well, which makes me think that I like pain sometimes. The Chongqing chicken was a little disappointing- though the texture and flavors were there, the pieces of chicken itself was miniscule, and at some point, I felt like I was just eating battered fried bits. I loved the stir-fried Chinese watercress- great flavor without the veggies being overdone. The Dan Dan noodles were OK.

The biggest pros of this place is its authenticity, Yelp check-in discount and coupons in Clipper Magazine (also Groupons) and fast service."}
{"text":"Another great place in Pittsburgh to get Sichuan food. Other place is How Lee's but I think both are pretty much the same.

They not only have Sichuan food but they also have non-spicy traditional Chinese food. They are pretty decent but you could probably get the same dishes elsewhere that are better tasting and cheaper. So I highly recommend getting the Sichuan dishes.

Dishes I recommend:

Fu Qi Fei Pian (????) - Beed tripe, tendon, tongue in Chili Oil (My Absolute Favorite)
Shijin Mao Xue Wang (?????)- Pork Blood Tofu, Intestines, Fish Fillet and Beef Tripe
Jiang Bei Shui Zhu Yu (?????)- Fish Fillet in Spicy Broth, Chongqing Style
San Bei Ji (???)- Chicken with Basil (This is okay here, better at Rose Tea)
Yu Xiang Huo Jiang Chao Qie Zi (???????) - Chinese Eggplant in Garlic Sauce or Soy Sauce

Things I recommend not to get:
San Xian Sa Guo Dou Fu (??????) - Chicken, Jumbo Shrimp, Pork, Tofu in Casserole (Compared to the Spicy dishes this is extremely flavorless. I guess if you do want to get this, make sure nothing overpowers it or you won't taste anything)
 Xiang Yu Kou Rou (????) - Steamed Pork with Taro (Tiny portion, with very little taro)"}
{"text":"Great selection of items on their lunch menu. Most of the entrees are sort of pricey but their portions are huge so it's probably worth it. Very authentic food!"}
{"text":"WOW.  I came from Houston to visit family.  I always thought our Chinatown food was good.  That is until I tried this place.  The food all smelled and looked so good, I didn't have time to take any pictures.  I just dug in.  Everything was memorable.  My picks were the mushroom with basil and taro, sautéed green vegetable, and soft tofu with fish.  I wanted to order more but we already had enough dishes.  Definitely, I will have to return.  If you are vegetarian, this place is happy to accommodate.  There are a variety of vegetarian/vegan dishes on the menu already.  If you are strict vegan or gluten-free, this may not be ideal for you.  If you are not strict, then eat on!"}
{"text":"Most authentic Chinese place in Pittsburgh. This is a really rare place to find around here and it's comparable to restaurants in NYC or SF"}
{"text":"Right next to Los palmas and I didn't know it till now?! Great renovation and hopefully the food is as good as the one in squirrel hill"}
{"text":"At the time of writing this I drive Uber full time in Pittsburgh and without exception all my Chinese passengers feel that this restaurant best represents the cuisine of their homeland in China. Along with Sheng do gourmet, also in Squirrel Hill. I  Have eaten at both and have found that they both are very oily for my preference, but certainly do offer more authentic Chinese options. Overall, I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I found a real Szechuan chinese food here ,oh my god really happiness. ,after order a mala pork and a fish hot pot and finished it,I feeling really full ,will come back next week,thks so much"}
{"text":"Seated quickly and service was attentive. 

The food was delicious. We shared the scallion pancake, pork fried dumplings, and the spicy beef pot. All three were really good. 

I would definitely come back and try more things. I thought that the food was slightly overpriced, but overall a good spot in Oakland."}
{"text":"Was craving Chinese food and passed this place many times.  Finally gave it a try and glad I did.  Ordered Chengdu style diced chicken with peppers.  Not overly hot, but enough zing to satisfy me. I bet if you wanted spiced up, all you would have had to do is tell them and you would end up breathing fire. And a nice sized portion, although at first I thought I might have some leftovers, I wound up eating every delicious bite.  Perfectly seasoned.  Perfectly sauced.  
The service is a bit slow, but very pleasant.  Wasn't overly busy.  Lots of Asian people eating food and I didn't see anything but empty plates going back. So the other dishes must be that good also.  Surely there are enough intriguing dishes for me to give this a try. I saw this enormous bowl of noodle soup at the next table.  Looked like enough for 6 big eaters.  Maybe next time.....And I definitely want to try Pork Belly.  C'mon now....how can something called Pork Belly be anything buy heavenly delicious because we all know Pork Fat Rules!!!!
I did not think the prices were overly expensive, however, they are a bit pricier than some of the other Chinese restaurants.  However,this is REAL Sichuan style food.  And they have an American menu too for those who don't want the spicy stuff with the usual suspects...sweet and sour and General Tso's Chicken (the Chinese equivalent to KFC).  
The food here stacks up with most of the other Asian type restaurants so prevalent in the Squirrel Hill area.  Along with Everyday Noodles, Chengdu Gourmet, Bangkok Balcony and New Dumpling House, one could eat Asian food every day and not get bad meal on the Hill.   And not go broke doing it, either."}
{"text":"Vegetarians and vegans beware. I dined at Sichuan Gourmet on 3/16/2016.  I ordered the \"ma po tofu\" from the vegetarian section of the lunch menu.  What I realized when I got home and started becoming violently ill, was that this dish was not vegetarian as advertised. A quick Google search confirmed what I already knew, that \"ma po tofu\" is made with minced meat, yet Sichuan Gourmet lists it as \"vegetarian\". I returned to the restaurant around noon on 3/17/2016 and asked to speak to the manager. I was told the manager was not in, and forced to  deal with one of the rudest women I've ever had the misfortune of taking to.  She chastised me for not calling in the previous night. I told her I was busy being violently ill the previous night, and that I would rather speak to someone face-to-face. She kept blaming me, and even admitted that their \"Ma Po Tofu\" has pork in it!  Yet this rude woman would only refund the cost of the meal and not the total charged to my credit card.  She outright ignored my concerns and comments that dishes with meat should NOT be listed in the vegetarian section, and refused to take any kind of accountability for it, let alone heed my suggestion to remove such dishes from the vegetarian section of the menu.  It's clear Sichuan Gourmet doesn't care about their customers, and they especially don't care about vegetarians. I shouldn't have to Google ANYTHING listed in the \"Vegetarian\" section of a menu to find out if it has meat on it or not.  How they could even list such a thing as vegetarian is incomprehensible. That coupled with the HORRIBLE treatment I received when asking for a refund will ensure I NEVER eat at Sichuan Gourmet ever again.  Vegans and vegetarians stay away from this place, unless you really enjoy being deceived and getting sick from that deception."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered from Sichuan Gourmet via Grubhub, at both locations. This is a review for the Atwood location.

I suppose for Pittsburgh, this place is aight. I ordered from here a few times, and each time has been quite a disappointment. In previous times, food tasted bland (quick fried cabbage with peppers, eggplant with garlic, spicy fish fillet with tofu).

This time, food was bland AND took forever to come. My order took 80 minutes from the time the order was placed to the time I received it in hand. The quick fried cabbage ($10)  I ordered was mushy... the texture is supposed to be slightly crispy. The tofu+vegetable soup I ordered was $10, but it literally served less than two portions. What a ripoff, especially considering it was rather bland as well.

So... $25 for two entrees after tip & delivery... for bland food with semi-small portions... after waiting for 80 minutes... I don't think that's worth it."}
{"text":"FYI: Only had takeout here once so far but plan on going back for a sit down dinner with my SO soon. 

However, in the meantime, since I couldn't wait, and since I got a hankering for some Sichuan pepper (aka numbing spice, or ma la), I ordered a dinner portion of dry hot chicken as it's often known. Here the menu item is called Chonqing pepper chicken per the receipt, I think, although the person over the phone called it Sichuan chicken. So I'm not sure. 

Either way, it was exactly what the doctor ordered. After the numbing reaction fully set in and my tongue felt like it was on fire, tingling, and numb at the same time, I knew I had some good Sichuan pepper at hand!

The dish was slightly more flavorful than elsewhere I've had, especially because of the fresh sprigs of cilantro. However, it wasn't anything to write home about quite yet. 

Ultimately, I will update this review upon a more thorough sampling of the menu in the future. Assuming all goes well, I hope for 4 stars!"}
{"text":"It's so great to get authentic, fresh, home made Chinese food.  Courses are city priced about $13-$15 each but good sized portions.  Started w the egg roll.  Fresh, crispy and home made.  The pan fried dumplings were the same.  I also got the dried chicken that is pictured numerous times on yelp.  That was delightful and different.  I love that they aren't shy about making spicy food and using hot peppers. I'm sure I could have increased the intensity but the rest in my party don't have a high tolerance.  Still, they enjoyed that chicken entree(which we requested as an appetizer) just picking around the peppers.  The 5 spice beef noodle soup was great.  Maybe you can ask for extra small bowls to share.  It was a lot for one person but I'm not complaining!  The last 2 dishes were shredded beef w peppers and chow fun.  Excellent portions and taste.  All of this for the 5 of us.  Saturday night seating time took about 10 minutes at 745 pm.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a quite big restaurant with good environment and nice atmosphere. The service is also good too. But the food is not very tasty. All the dishes are too salty to finish, although the amount of food is really small. So the price is really high according to its amount and flavor and not worthy at all. It's not a very pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"My first impression with this place is not a great one.

I ordered the sauteed conch with basil, and was vastly disappointed. It was almost 19 dollars for a half full take-home container of one of the blandest dishes to my mouth's recent memory. 

I have a gut feeling that this place can serve up good food, but don't you dare have something on the menu at that cost if you won't own up to it.

Also, it's kind of embarrassing that we now live in a world where there is literally a \"American\" chinese menu and a \"Authentic\" menu. True, New How Lee does it, but they don't blatantly label it as so, and feels a bit like coddling to label one menu as American..as if to say \"hey, come here and eat something that doesn't resemble Chinese food at all\"

My interest is still there though..as PGH only has a very small selection for real-sh Chinese food, but I will put out a warning:

There's a reason this location has switched owners 3 different times in the past few years."}
{"text":"Oh, so delicious. Huge menu, and in the three times I've been there, the food has been delicious. Here's the ma po tofu...with fish! And here's the cumin lamb...with enough Sichuan peppercorns to make you feel it the next day.

Two nice features about the menu. One, there's a section labeled \"American Chinese\"--helpful for me, so I know what to avoid. Two, there's a section of steamed dishes, which makes my salt- and oil-free Nana very happy.

Would be five stars, except the place could use a good cleaning. Random boxes everywhere and a sub-par bathroom."}
{"text":"Great Sichuan in Pgh! I ordered a bunch of food so I could get a few meals out of my trip here and I am so happy I did. I loved the double cooked pork, mapo tofu, and eggplant in garlic. The scallion pancake didn't have enough scallion for my taste, but was still good -- nice and flaky."}
{"text":"Very good quality steak in my sichuan beef.  Could have been a little more spicy.  Service was excellent.  Extensive menu including pork, chicken, beef, lamb , duck, seafood and much more.  I will return."}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant around CMU and University of Pittsburgh! I enjoy every dish here, as well as their service. You will love it!"}
{"text":"Braised Pork Rib Noodle Soup- the best thing I've eaten in months. And hotttttttt. Slurp, sniff, blow nose, slurp. This broth is the real thing x17. 

How long has it been since I had to blow my nose throughout the meal? Oh my gunness. 

And the noodles. I've never been much of a noodle-raver but these puppies know my name. 

Also in my favor is an eight percent discount with Yelp check-in."}
{"text":"I thank god that this place exists. I've been here for almost every occasion (in a relationship, after a breakup, during a relationship break, with friends, with acquaintances, during finals week, on awkward double dates) and the food always is great! The Cumin Lamb is one of my favorites, Mao's Pork Belly is deliciously sweet and salty, and the Garlic Rib Tips are yummmyyy! I will continue coming here until I move out of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I always come here for dinner with my friends. This is a typical Sichuan restaurant. The spicy pickle fish is my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Try their fish with tofu. I almost come here everyday for lunch and even some times for dinner. Food is mildly spicy but satisfying."}
{"text":"I was literally reading reviews of this place as my husband and I were on our way to the restaurant. I heard all of you smart Yelpers say over and over that this is the place for authentic Sichuan food, not delicious Americanized Chinese food. I could practically hear Yelp speaking out loud to me...\"Order from the Sichuan menu, Tricia.\"

But guys, I love Americanized Chinese food. I love authentic food too, but I can never resist the urge to try guilty pleasure Americanized food. So when the time came to order, I'm sad to say that I ignored your advice and ordered a general-tso-esque dish (\"Amazing Crispy Chicken\") from the Americanized menu.

And the result? My meal filled with tough, overcooked chicken in an overly-sweet, one-note sauce went virtually uneaten and I ended up stealing half of my poor husband's Chongqing Chicken, which was spicy and flavorful. Yelp was right...the Sichuan menu is where the good stuff is. You guys knew it. My husband knew it. And now I know it. Next time I won't be foolish enough to go my own way, despite my unnatural love of all things general tso. 

Service was very friendly and the food came out quick. I'll definitely be back again to order from the correct part of the menu! :)"}
{"text":"I have been a regular at Sichuan Gourmet, and it's usually been really good. My favorite is the Chongqing style fried chicken, which is fantastic with white rice. But today I came with my family here for dinner and had a very disappointing experience. Everything we ordered came out extremely salty, and the pork we ordered tasted funny like it's not fresh. I can vouch for the quiet ambiance and nice waitresses here, but can no longer recommend the restaurant for their food. The quality of food really follows their main chef, who rotates between the Oakland location and the Squirrel Hill location. The word on the street is that their only main chef is at the Oakland location on weekdays and at the Squirrel Hill location on weekends. So I would still check them out but only when the main chef is there. Hope this is helpful for future patrons."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  The mapo tofu is amazing.  We always order wontons in hot chili oil"}
{"text":"Overall OK experience. The dumplings and noodles are Okay, but they had too much garlic. The rabbit meat is not very  good. The meat must have been frozen for a long time, because the texture is not tender at all. By the way, the rabbit is a staple food in my home town, so I know what a good rabbit dish taste like. I tried Jade grille and this place, and I think that I would go jade grill more often."}
{"text":"Great new chinese restaurant, just opened two weeks ago at the former location of Pacific Ring.
They have an dauntingly long menu, we ordered dou miao (watercress), fried whole riverfish, beef tongue appetizer, and the dumplings in chile oil... yummy!  There is still much more i want to try from their menu and I haven't figured out what's best to eat from this place yet... but what we ordered was really delicious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for a lunch or dinner. I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to deviate from their typical Chipotle or Subway routine."}
{"text":"The food's not too bad. I ordered a seafood and tofu soup and it basically was a white egg drop soup with imitation crab, little pieces of scallion, and vegetables I assume were once in a frozen bag. Not sure what style of Sichuan food this is, but I guess I should go in knowing a little more about what to order next time."}
{"text":"I don't travel 900 miles to this restaurant once a year for the service. I've never had anything bad off the \"traditional\" menu. One of my favorite chinese restaurants in the US."}
{"text":"It's a great restaurant. The pork intestine with hot pepper in flaming pan and grilled whole fish with special flavor are super fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"Sichuan Gourmet is the most legit Sichuan place in Pittsburgh.

It's a shame the place is tucked away a little ways from the bustling Oakland cauldron of restaurants, but people still manage to find their way to this gem.

A defining characteristic of Sichuan spicy is the savory, numbing spicy, and this place really brings it to you. Furthermore, their dishes are very authentic, and they make their meat taste good! Everything tastes fresh, not dry, and it's just a joy to eat.

A big plus is that their American Chinese menu is just as good, so if you have friends that don't like spicy, they'll still be in good selection of other tasty options.

Service here is actually really good compared to other Chinese restaurants. They treat their Chinese and non Chinese patrons with respect, and you feel well pampered.

The wait here can get long, but it's for a good reason. Stop by to try the best Sichuan the steel city has to offer."}
{"text":"Sichuan Gourmet attempts to recreate authentic Sichuan cuisine with its classic and diverse menu. You can get any meat here, from fish, chicken, beef, to even frog. However, although the choices here are plentiful, I feel that the food falls short of expectations. The food looks good when you see it--all the colors are there and the shine on the food looks delicious. However, for the mala food, the flavor just isn't quite clear cut. The spicy is like kinda spicy but not really, and misses the kick that Sichuan spicy needs. Also, I was pretty disappointed with how they prepared their drier dishes. I ordered a cumin lamb, and to my dismay was presented a few, and really dried and shriveled pieces of meat. Also, for my beef hot pot, the beef was cooked way too over done so it tasted like rubbery dry scraps. 

The restaurant offers everything that makes a good Sichuan restaurant, but needs to execute correctly to earn it's spot as a top Chinese place."}
{"text":"Those other places can keep their stir fried rice and General Tso's chicken- which admittedly can still be good at times. But this stuffffff... Oh my. 

We were six people. We got five dishes. One had lamb. One had chicken, with a flaming ember still underneath. Another had pork. I think there was a beef, and one of green beans. And we set them all in the middle of the table and devoured them like a pack of hungry family members. Our waitress had helped us decide on what to order. She spoke broken English and yet was so helpful and nice and even helped with gluten accommodations. There are so many possible ways to prepare such ingredients, and yet with Sichuan Gourmet's way of cooking, I simply could not ask for a tastier meal. 

And then, complimentary orange slices at the end of the meal. The option of ordering pork brain. Eight percent off total bill when you check-in with the Yelp app. Inviting atmosphere, borderline almost upscale, unlike the bland food-getting place it could so easily be. I will return to Sichuan Gourmet forevermore when I need real Chinese food. 

***With credits to my Malaysian friend and my Taiwanese friend for having previously introduced me to such a way of eating.***"}
{"text":"This location is almost as good as the original in Squirrel Hill, and is one of the best places to get authentic Sichuan food in Pittsburgh (probably in all of Western PA).

The knocks are the ambiance (the location used to be an Indian restaurant and they didn't change a ton) and the service (which is slower and a little more disorganized than the original), but the recipes are the same and the food is great.

I'm a big fan of the Chengdu style chicken and the double cooked sliced pork belly, but if you really can't handle spice, try the \"Chicken with Basil\" (an authentic but non-Sichuan dish with a bit of sweetness, garlic and, you guessed it, basil).

I've gone here for lunch meetings, social dinners, and take-out, and would (nay, will) happily return."}
{"text":"They changed the name, but kept the deliciousness.

Sichuan Gourmet (formerly China Star) offers authentic and dishes in addition to the American hybrids most locals think of as \"Chinese food.\"  The spicy Sichuan pantheon nicely complements what I grew up thinking of as the classics, so Sichuan Gourmet is a top tier choice for any type of Chinese meal.

Favorites on the authentic side include chengdu style diced chicken with dry peppers (sauteed with hot peppers, oil, and some amazing spices) and the double cooked sliced pork belly (a more unusual, almost woodsy, taste for some American palates, but this thin sliced meat with green peppers has never disappointed).

Excellent dishes that might look more familiar include cumin lamb (which is particularly good here) and the also excellent Singapore style curried rice noodles.

The worst part of a trip here is choosing.  Do I pick an old favorite, or try something new from the extensive menu?  Do I go Sichuan style today, or opt for a more American taste?  Do I share with the table, or horde my precious preferred delicacy all for myself?  These are real dilemmas, which deserve careful deliberation before a trip (personally, I like to go with a group and share, so we can order all kinds of cuisine and try new things in addition to old standbys).

Another drawback might be the servers.  Occasionally you'll get an off day on the service side, and more often than that there may be some language barriers (if you're like me and don't speak Chinese).  But don't let that stand in the way of a fantastic culinary experience that seems to be truly unique in Pittsburgh.

Bottom line: Great quality and recipes make this establishment a taste leader among Pittsburgh Chinese restaurants, and it's certainly worth a detour, or a special trip.  In fact, I'll go out on a limb right now and declare: this is my favorite Chinese restaurant in all of Allegheny County."}
{"text":"It's been more than an hour since we ordered our dinner (two entrees for $30, not including tip) ASAP, and the food has yet to arrive. When hubby called to check on its progress, the person who answered the phone didn't even ask for the order but automatically assured him \"The driver is on his way.\" I should have known that delivery for $1 was too good to be true. I'll come back to update this review with our opinions of the food if we ever get to eat any of it.  Nevertheless, we'll find another Chinese take-out restaurant to patronize.

Update: Food took 1 hour 20 minutes to arrive. It was mostly warm. The chicken with basil and quick-fried Chinese broccoli were good. We particularly liked the fried rice. Better to eat-in or get take-out than delivery from Sichuan Gourmet."}
{"text":"Meh -- tried the supposed best that Pittsburgh had to offer in Chinese and was disappointed. Mediocre noodle dishes -- the zha jia mien used noodles that were lacking in firmness. Other dishes I had were on the extremes of either being too salty or too flat and tasteless. 

Also, weird tasting water."}
{"text":"Most dishes are really outstanding like the Triple Green vegetable chicken, and the dumplings. 
However, some of the Pittsburgh flavor menu just aren't that great, General Tso is one of these, as is the Lo Mein, the worst is the Pepper Steak was just steak with two inch chunks of undercooked peppers & onions. Stick with the more authentic, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you want to taste Chinese food, here is the best choice. Different type of Chinese food you can try. I recommend Kung-pao chicken."}
{"text":"OVERALL: hands-down best Sichuan restaurant in Pittsburgh in terms of flavor. Come here for authentic Sichuan food, but make sure you order off the \"traditional\" menu. Environment is nice but service is mediocre. 

Sichuan gourmet is one of my favorite places to go, for both lunch and dinner. First of all, they have great lunch specials, which are perfect for students who have some time between classes to go eat. It's generally under $8 and come with soup or a drink. The portions are perfect for lunch. They have a traditional Chinese menu as well as an American menu for their lunch specials.

As for dinner, they have great options as well. As a warning though, their American dishes are not impressive. I ordered the fried rice there once, and it was a solid 2/5. 

I wrote this review to commend Sichuan Gourmet for their fantastic traditional Chinese dishes, which are authentic and flavorful. The prices for the entrees can get pricey, but it is fair for the area. Some of my favorites are the Chongqing fried chicken, which is the best rendition I've eaten in Pittsburgh, Mapo Tofu, Shui zhu beef, and pork with celery and dried tofu. The Sichuan flavor is very present in all these dishes. As someone from that area of China, it makes me extremely happy to see food like this near my college campus."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp. Would not have found without the reviews. 

I came here based on reviews of authentic Szechuan. The menu is enormous but 75% of the items are not your typical sweet and sour or cashew chicken on most Chineese restaurants or even those that have Szechuan in their name. So I'm getting pretty excited.  I've had the best Szechuan food in Paris and was told it was authentic. I've been trying to recreate that experience again in the States with lots of disappointment. 

The food is amazing. Not as spicy as I could handle but plenty spicy for my wife and daughter. I was not at all disappointed. The flavor is so much more pronounced than I'm accustom from even the nicest Chineese restaurants I frequent in the DC area.

I will literally come back to Pittsburgh for this Resturant and bring friends to enjoy the Szechuan delights. The portions are huge and ten people could easily eat for under $100 if they chose. We had plenty of take away for our trip back to Virginia. 

Thank you Pittsburgh. Thank you Yelp. And Thank you Szechuan Gourmet Resturant"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  My friends and I went on a Saturday night and we got hot pot.  I knew it was authentic when they brought out a menu that was only in Chinese for the hotpot.  Fortunately one of my friends knew a bit of Chinese and 2 of the servers came over to help us translate.  We got the rib broth which was delicious and spicy.  As 3 Caucasians, we were all in tears over the spiciness but it was so good.  The rest of the menu is also extensive with many interesting options and seems to be pretty authentic.  One of my friends used to live in China for a year and was very impressed with it.  Atmosphere was nice and family friendly, with plenty of seating room.  Servers were all very nice and friendly, though we had a hard time communicating as their English was somewhat limited.  Prices are very reasonable and portions are generous.  I'll definitely go back here again."}
{"text":"Tried this place for delivery on a cold Tuesday night. Ordered egg rolls, sesame chicken and the \"amazing chicken\". The egg rolls were mysterious, not sure what was in them, some shrimp to be sure, they were ok. The entrees were soggy and somehow still not saucy enough. Bland flavors, sad broccoli, not a hint of crispiness left in the chicken. The only amazing thing about the chicken was the multiple pieces that were not in fact chicken but pure breading. We will not be ordering from here again and have no idea how this place had such a high rating."}
{"text":"I've finally had a chance to dine here in person, and was blown away by the deliciousness of the meal. 

First and foremost, the dry sautéed green beans with minced pork we had were DELICIOUS. Easily the best green beans I've ever had, and I'd go back there just for that alone. So good. Seriously--try this! My friend and I also sampled the steamed eggplant with garlic and spicy sauce. The spicy sauce was simply red chili oil and came on the side (much to the delight of my friend). The eggplant was simple but tasty, and another nice edition to an otherwise super spicy meal.

I opted for the sautéed eel as my entrée (from the specials menu) and my friend was boring got the beef hor fun. He has a thing about not eating spicy food in public because of how red it turns him, but I decided to go for the more authentic sichuan style dish. The eggplant was sliced into thin strips, lightly battered and fried, and then sautéed with green peppers, ginger, bamboo, celery and the signature red chili oil. It. Was. Delicious. By the time I was halfway though (still had enough left over for a meal afterwards) my lips were tingling and my nose was running. To you all that may seem like torture, but it was worth it because of the flavor it gave the dish. I asked for a to go container for the left over chili oil and they kindly obliged. 

The service was friendly and relaxed--we did not feel rushed to hurry our way through the meal like at some other establishments, and the staff was very friendly. I'm glad I finally got a chance to visit this place in person--I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. Luckily they are not the only one (Jade Grille in Mt. Lebanon also boasts many authentic dishes). As a vegetarian there a plentiful options and each are prepared to spec. I love numb peppers and this place uses them! Lots of options for all types of diners so meat lovers don't fret. The space is at best dingy, but clean. I've been in a lot worse in Chinatowns around the world! Worth checking out if you are in Sq. Hill and hungry for authentic Sichuan cooking."}
{"text":"We found Sichuan Gourmet to be just OK.  

We ordered a scallion pancake to start, followed by spicy beef noodle soup, hot and spicy crispy chicken and chicken fried rice.  Scallion pancake was fine, hard to mess up.  The noodle soup was very disappointing to me.  The broth was extremely oily with not a whole lot of flavor.  I didn't even finish it.  The crispy chicken could not be described as crisp or spicy, I barely ate that either.  The fried rice was the shining star. 

I've just had better and the large oil layer on top of the soup broth was just unappetizing.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Huge menu of authentic Chinese dishes. Best experienced family style. 

I had the half Peking Duck which took 20 - 30 minutes to prepare (I was warned when ordering). It was perfectly sized for me and the manager made the first couple of wraps for me and the waiter finished off. I probably should have just done it myself to back off the sauce a bit. They tossed in some steamed rice for free. Not quite the quality of those stands you find in Taipei, but a decent rendition that borders on roast duck (dryer) as opposed to my idea of Peking duck where the skin is crispy with a layer of fat and tender meat. At under $20 with tea, this was pretty good bang for the buck.

You could probably try a different dish for a whole year here with something for everyone. Everyone seemed really happy in a mid-week packed house. Service can be a little slow as the ration of customers to waiters seems to be a bit high."}
{"text":"This is great place and we have fan in here.  I really recommend spicy crab. ??????????????????????"}
{"text":"Who would of thought you find this type of chinese food in Pittsburgh, but damn this is place is good.  The flavors are on point, the smell when you walk in the place smells like spices and sichuan peppers.  

I ordered the chengdu pork and the green beans with minced pork, great options full of spices, not too spicy.  Don't go to this place if your on a diet, lots of oils.  Worth the visit for sure and a return visit."}
{"text":"I come here often to get my spicy sichuan fix. The food is authentic and always brings me back to my time spent in Chengdu.

The Chengdu sliced pork belly is a plate of fatty oily heaven. The sauteed green beans and dan dan noodles are also a must."}
{"text":"Hot damn!  My mouth is on fire with the fond memories of my mouth being on fire!

The secret to China Star is to order from the Chinese menu, not the white folks menu.  Or even better, order whatever is on the whiteboard when you come into the restaurant. 

Don't go in and order egg rolls and general Tso's chicken and expect it to be anything but mediocre.

DO order a flaming pan (especially the duck in beer if they have it).

Expect your face will be burnt off it you ask for it spicy.

My favorite dishes: Dry fried Chongquing chicken, mapo tofu, sauteed green beans with pork, spicy lamb in flaming pan, don don noodles and anything with bamboo shoots. 

The service is standard for a somewhat authentic Chinese restaurant.  Your waiter will not be around because it is expected that you will be there for a long time and that you will seek out your waiter if you need something.
  
And if you will pardon the gloating for a moment, THIS IS MY CORNER CHINESE WE-DONT- FEEL-LIKE-COOKING-ON-TUESDAY-Joint.  Can you say 'spoiled?'

ps-it's BYOB AND next to a liquor store!  Heaven!"}

We eat at the Squirrel Hill location all the time to get our spicy fix. It's great food that keeps us coming back!

Ms Beffrey loves melt-your-face-off spicy, whereas Mr Beffrey likes it a tad more on the human level. The menu has items that spans the spectrum.  Our new favorites are the Snow Pea Shoots, which are tender greens quickly sautéed and salted. Tasty but on the expensive side given its simple preparation. The spicy chicken in chili peppers is a must try if you can tolerate it. The chicken is fried and crispy, though beware the dish looks like it's 90% chili pepper (edible though!).  We highly recommend the Mongolian need, which is a different more numb-y kind of spicy. Packed with flavor.

Ambiance is a typical Chinatown-y feel -- pleather booths, unflattering lighting, loud, really nothing to set any sort of mood.  Pretty on par with 99% of Chinese restaurants.  Service is similarly Chinatownesque: fast, erring on the side of brusque, sometimes you get a little overlooked in the hustle and bustle, but (in true Asian fashion) generally very efficient. Don't come expecting to have a pampering experience.

Love the food here, which is what prompts us to come back time and again, though we do almost only takeout now."}
{"text":"Good Chinese food.  We got fried rice, egg rolls and Kung pao chicken.  Enjoyed all.  Never been to China so I cannot comment on authenticity.  1 dinner entree MORE than enough for two with rice.  Close and convenient online ordering for pickup or delivery.  We will probably be back (still have more places to try!)"}
{"text":"Pros: Pretty good dinner entrees if you like spicy foods. I really liked the chow mein.

Cons: service wasn't phenomenal; it was just okay"}
{"text":"Spicy Crispy Chicken and Ma Po Tofu were excellent, as were the dumplings in red oil. Prices and service were also great. Would definitely recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter there today and it was pretty good, the steamed shrimp wrapped in rice paper was delicious. Her wonton soup was exceptionally tasty, the wontons were filled with huge amounts of meat. My dish was shrimp, scallops and vegs in a mildly spicy peanut sauce with brown rice, very tasty. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the general tso chicken wasn't that good that my daughter ordered, the chicken I tasted was dry and the sauce was too thick, kind of stringy. They need to work on that dish, try chunkier chicken meat and thinner sauce.  I will go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place initially, but for the past few visit, we had this short hair middle-age waitress that is very unfriendly to her customers. We had to wait for a long time to be asked what we want to order, and our water never got refilled, we have to ask for napkins again and again because each time we only got a few piece of bar napkins. 

We normally tip waiter/waitress at least 20% and we have to tip her 12% to discourage bad attitude. As working in service industry, being just a little bit more friendly is doing for your own  good"}
{"text":"If you want some authentic, fresh Sichuan food, Sichuan gourmet is the place to go. The menu is totally diverse with its offerings and everything is made from scratch. The service is quick and friendly, and the prices are very reasonable. This is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. I love the food, which is pretty authentic in my opinion. Sometimes the wait is a while because they're always crowded, but I think its definitely worth it. Their hotpot is also amazing, tastes like what I had when I was in Shanghai. They also deliver so that's nice. The staff is friendly, especially if you speak some Chinese because they get all excited about speaking in Chinese, its actually really cute. Also, they recently renovated their restaurant so its pretty clean! The only downside of Sichuan Gourmet is that its a bit pricy so I can't eat it everyday. But i definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner and it was much better than we expected. The decor is nothing special, but the service was friendly, quick and helpful with suggestions. I liked that there was a separate American menu. Absolutely loved the hot and sour silk tofu. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Your delivery sucks. Don't speak in chinese at the first time! Also, teach some basic manners to your delivery man. They are so rude and impolite!!"}
{"text":"Whenever I come here, I buy multiple dishes to eat and bring home with me. Come here if you like authetic chinese food. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I think this is one of the best Chinese food places I've ever been to. Definitely the best around the CMU area, and my friends agree!"}
{"text":"Got order wrong. Put meat in everything. Called and was told kitchen was closed and they would refund my money. The money was refunded. The food that did arrive was your run of mill Chinese place. Nothing special, or with risking a wrong order on. If you want meat you should be OK."}
{"text":"Pretty nice decoration of Sichuan cuisine  restaurant for us authentic Sichuan gourmet. Cuisine have absolute great taste for Chinese food lover, Especially for Sichuan people. The marinated chill pepper brings up the taste for the stirred fried liver & waist? strongly recommend for anyone visiting the place around?"}
{"text":"I'm adding Sichuan as one of my go-to Chinese restaurants. I have been to Sichuan before for Chinese New Year and was not impressed. My friend had a Groupon so we went here again. They had changed their menu so it was more presentable. They still separate the \"Traditional\" and \"American\" menu. We ordered the pork belly and stir fried noodles. The pork belly was to die for. I actually wished they gave more rice with the dish because I would dump it into the sauce and eat it plain like that. The size of the entrees are pretty big and through perseverance (not really) my friend and I plowed through both dishes. I would order the sliced pork belly (without spice) in a heartbeat again."}
{"text":"Hesitating between 4 and 5 stars. Definitely a wider spectrum of choices compared to all other Chinese restaurants in this city. Price is the reason that prevents me from visiting every single weekend. With a larger group of people this place would definitely be a top choice as their portion is good. But 1-2 people? Maybe I'll try the other two places in squirrel hill as they have appetizers and dishes that are less generically Chinese.

Sichuan style, which means spicy food here is decent in general. They do have some choices that are not available everywhere else, like frogs, special types of vegetables. And if you do not have a high spice tolerance, no need to worry here. They adjusted their dishes well enough to satisfy both Chinese and American customers.  (A second reason this is not my personal favorite) Milder dishes are also available. Spicy fish dishes are normally fresher compared to other places and I strongly recommend them. Pork dishes are also very nice. 

Can be crowded and loud on weekends. But they do accept seat reservation (as far as I can remember). And they have two private rooms for larger groups. These rooms can be combined and is large enough for a group of around 25. Might need a while for food to be ready (same for most Chinese food), so if you are going starved either get appetizers or more dishes. One dish per person is usually enough.

Try it and I hope you will love it as I did!"}
{"text":"Food was very good.   Crowd was nice.  Atmosphere wasn't bad either.   Prices were fair.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Sichuan cuisine, with the bold flavors, SG is your place.  The menu is large and some of the most popular are written on a black board on the wall.  This location is not a large and it was full the day we dined.  
We tried several items to share and all were very good.  The spicy lamb was tasty and as it is called had some very nice spice flavors.  The Pork with vermicelli was another very good dish.  We had a Sichuan rice that was also a good rice dish with some peppers to add some flavor.  One of the dishes we ordered was a chicken dish, but I did not get the name and it was probably the best dish of the evening.  
We really enjoyed our meal, the prices are very reasonable and we had plenty of leftovers for another meal."}
{"text":"I became a bit suspicious when I noticed pork in the dishes listed under the vegetarian section of the menu. I ordered a tofu dish and what came had just tofu and sort of a syrupy brown sauce. It was way too salty for me and seemed to have large amounts of MSG. My friend ordered a noodle salad, also too salty and very strongly garlic. The restaurant was filled with Chinese and customers so it did seem very popular. However, I will not return and only picked at my meal."}
{"text":"Should be top Chinesefood in Pittsburgh! I like it so much! I often have lunch or dinner at this restaurant, it never disappoints me!"}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food! Come here almost once a week. Sandman noodle is good. Recommend trying the dry-pot series also."}
{"text":"Twice I have gotten take out from this restaurant. The first time they forgot two of the five dishes I ordered. The second time I got the completely wrong order. The food is good but if you actually want to get what you pay for I would suggest going down the street to Chengdu Gourmet"}
{"text":"Spicy and tasty! 

A friend and I came in tonight and we were seated at a booth. The restaurant was fairly empty, but it took a while for our server to get us our water for some reason. Got the sliced pork appetizer, sweet and sour cabbage, and crispy spicy chicken. (We had originally wanted sauteed water spinach instead of the cabbage, but it wasn't available.) Portions were fairly large. The sliced pork isn't as spicy as it might seem and the crispy chicken is definitely as spicy as it looks, but both were great. I wasn't a fan of the sweet and sour cabbage though; I thought it was too...sweet and sour? It tasted a little weird to me. At one point I got attacked by an extra spicy pepper (not sure from which dish, unfortunately, so I could not warn my friend). Water and rice did not help. My mouth was on fire and some tears rolled down my face. I totally made eye contact with one of the chefs who had just sat down a few tables away as I was sucking air into my mouth to cool it down. I'm sure he tried to hide a smile. He knew what he did. 

The ceiling lights down the center of the dining area looked like tree branches and all the furniture was wooden, so it kinda felt like we were in a giant tree house. Not gonna lie, in terms of interior, Sichuan Gourmet really stands out from other restaurants on Atwood.

I'd definitely prefer this location to the one in Squirrel Hill. The flavors are stronger and the interior is way cooler.

{"text":"I would hate to complain if I felt like we simply ordered poorly, but this experience struck out in every way: 

The waitstaff took entirely too long to address our table when many other tables around us were being seated and served. We ordered three dishes (steamed vegetables, vegetable lo mein, and kung pao beef) and tea. All three dishes were seriously not good, to the point that we left them on the table untouched. [How do you ruin lo mein?!?!?] I had to prompt the server twice to bring our tea, and we never got refills on our water. We had to, finally, ask another server to bring our check because our server was nowhere to be found.

We will not be back. :-/"}
{"text":"The last time we ate there (Feb 2014) , I had very bad headache from the MSG in the food. I was told by a friend that they changed the chief in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Ordered the Amazing Chicken, found it tough and overcooked.  Was my first time here, had a groupon. Would give it another chance. A very nice and clean restaurant. No place beats Taipei Restaurant in Fox Chapel."}
{"text":"Every time we walk by this place it is filled with Chinese people so we thought, hey, this must be the place to go... so we went.

There are so many choices... an Americanized menu and an \"authentic\" menu.

Well, WATCH OUT if you order from the real Chinese menu. They are not kidding when they say spicy. I got the spicy chicken in pan -- check out the pictures for a view -- and it was so hot that I couldn't feel my mouth. Don't get me wrong, I love spicy, but living in Pittsburgh for so long, I was out of practice for this one. The best part of the dish was the flavor. I tasted so many actual spices, like parsley and garlic and pieces of what looked like all spice. It wasn't just a heap of soy sauce. My husband's dish was covered in delicious garlic and beautiful peppers--both green and hot.

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The xi an pork bun is the best! Hot pot is also great!"}
{"text":"So I love the food here. I always order from the Chinese menu because, well, I'm no dummy. It's full of traditional dishes and I'm always discovering something new that I love. Whenever they have Chinese broccoli on hand, that's my go-to side for whatever spicy main dish I'll be ordering.  

Dining in is a fun experience and it's nice to be able to bring wine and not pay a corkage fee. The environment is busy, but very comfortable to relax for awhile and enjoy the meal. The lunch specials are a GREAT value during the week. 

I usually order delivery though, which is why I didn't give this 5 stars. For some reason, I ALWAYS have to tell the delivery folks to come to my apartment building instead of me coming out to their car. It's an odd problem and it's consistent. Still worth it because I just love the food that much."}
{"text":"4 1/2 is what I should give.

Oh so spicy, oh so good. The mushroom flaming pan is probably one of the tastiest vegetarian dishes I've had, period.

The flaming pan dishes are good, especially the fish (the mushrooms in that, oh so tasty)

Service can sometimes take some time, but there are days when they are quick too. I did a take out order yesterday and that probably took a total of 10 mins.

Tried duck tongue, probably won't try it again. Wasn't very fond of it.

Anyway, the place is a must go, especially if you enjoy mouth burning spicy food."}
{"text":"I'm running out of restaurants in Oakland that I haven't tried for lunch now.  I went here for lunch with a friend and we both enjoyed our meals.  She ordered the kung pao shrimp, but mentioned that it wasn't very spicy at all, which was a disappointment.  I ordered the sliced pork with fried rice cakes because I had no idea what fried rice cakes were.  The dish was definitely one of the most unique items I've ever had.  For anybody like myself who is unfamiliar with the rice cakes and the dish, I will let you know. 
The fried rice cakes were pretty much what they sounded like - cakes of rice, that had been lightly fried on the outside to hold them together and make them crispy.  The pork came in a sauce that had a viscosity somewhere between a broth and your typical Chinese corn-starch thickened sauce.  This was then poured over the rice cakes.  I was impressed that the rice cakes stayed together even after soaking in the sauce with the pork.  They took on a glutinous texture, which I enjoyed.  
I think I made it about halfway through my meal before I was so full I could not continue, so I got the remainder to take home for lunch later.  
The prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are good.  
The service was also good, we were seated promptly, followed immediately by our drink orders being taken.  The waitress was attentive and aware not to interrupt while we were obviously in the middle of a conversation.  It was very appreciated."}
{"text":"Teeny weeny portions!  One small container of rice for 4 entrees. Seriously ??? 
We ordered crab Rangoon and got pork dumplings . 
So if you don't want the food actually ordered, or rice to go with food you ordered and small portions with large price order away, otherwise scroll down, there's GOTTA be something better."}
{"text":"I got yelled by the lady when I called to let them know I didn't receive the dumplings which I ordered along with other dishes. How dare they.

They have decent food but that doesn't matter to me anymore. I am never going back to this place ever again.

HOW DARE YOU YELL AT THE CUSTOMER ABOUT YOUR FAULT!"}
{"text":"This really is a 4.5 star review. I took off the 1/2 star for the slightly high prices and lack of parking. Everything else was almost perfect.

The food here is YAS so tasty. My server Tom was fluent in both Chinese and English so was able to give some great recommendations. He was the nicest server I've ever had; all smiles! The menu itself is a work of art. Laminated in frosted matte paper, includes pretty pictures, hardbound and in both English and Chinese. 

I ordered the Flaming rabbit and my hubs ordered the Sichuan lamb. The Sichuan heat is real, you guys. We used up probably 6 napkins between the two of us to mop up sweat and sniffles. But it is not just plain hot--the authentic \"mala\" flavor really comes out. The prices are high and the portions are medium sized, but the variety and taste made up for it. It's a good sized restaurant for its cramped Squirrel Hill location and some of the art pieces are really beautiful. I will definitely be back to try Mao's pork belly in taro and many other amazing-sounding/looking dishes. 

Also, everyone else who was eating here was Chinese so I knew this joint was authentic. Usually, I am the only Asian person slurpin' my noodles at many a Thai, Chinese or Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese place in pittsburgh. Definitely eat in though because the portion sizes for take out are much smaller. Our favorite is E01 (spicy boiled fish), mapo tofu, and chonqing style chicken. They give you orange slices for dessert, which is nice."}
{"text":"Sichuan Gourmet is actually the best Sichuan food I've had in America. It's authentic, a reasonable price, and I love going back here again and again. I'm pretty salty that they don't have this place in the Bay Area!

Squirrel Hill is the original location (it has since expanded to Oakland). It's much larger and has \"private\" rooms for large groups or parties, which my organization has used every single year. The servers are polite and the food is generally timely, even when ordered in large quantities. 

I've tried a lot of dishes here, and my personal faves are: 

Appetizer: Fuqi Feipian (Sliced Beef Trip in Chili Oil), Dan Dan Mian (Noodles w/ minced Pork)
Entrees: Steamed Pork Belly w/ Taro, (Chong Qing La Zi Ji), Spicy Crispy Chicken w/ Chili Peppers, Huiguo Rou (doubled cooked Pork Belly)
Vegetables: Kong Xin Cai (seasonal)

Every time I come back to Pittsburgh, I'll be sure to come back to this restaurant. Go try it out if you love spicy food!"}
{"text":"Such a gem. Delicious (what I believe to be) authentic Chinese compared to the regular Americanized takeout places. We tried two soups - wonton and egg drop - both great and huge portions. The steamed pork buns are also fantastic."}
{"text":"This place is really authentic, if you are looking for REAL Chinese food, this place won't let you down, I recommend Chongqing Style Chicken. It's crispy, flavorful and most importantly, it is SPICY. The service here is standard nothing special."}
{"text":"This one has been my favorite Sichuan Restaurant for a long time, but I want to point out that they now offer Shaanxi food as supplement. One of the owner once told me that their Shaanxi Chef once cooked for the president of China. So far, I have tried various things, I like the lamb stew with bread the most. It is much more better than the famous Shaanxi restaurant Xi'an Famous Food in New York City."}
{"text":"Heavens to Betsy. This place screams authenticity to the max. Thankfully a friend of mine is married to a Chinese native and they scout out all the best Szechuan restaurants in town. This is a winner winner, chicken dinner! We had the shredded beef, asparagus and fish soup...all family style. The soup, SO good. The flavors were amazing and the fish very tender. The beef was not served in an over-cornstarched sauce and it was divine. We left fat and happy and I will be back here as soon as I can be!"}
{"text":"Bleh....coming from Philadelphia area and having been  to a very   good  Szechuan restaurant in dc once..the food here isn't that good and all...  come on Pittsburgh this is your most  authentic?"}
{"text":"I've not started eating but just looking at the menu is making me deliriously happy.  SG, how did I miss you?!

Food arrived.  It was authentic (we just got back from china--this was better than some places there), the service was fast and efficient, and it was delicious.  You can order 'Americanized' Chinese or go authentic--either way, you are in for a treat.

Ordered:  

-smoky pork belly with seasoning and tofu 
-Sichuan style dumplings
-beef trip & tongue in chili oil 
-dan dan noodle
-pan fried hot peppers"}
{"text":"It took a while to be seated when it wasn't that busy, even longer to order food and only half the table was served while my food did not come the timer stopped at 17 minutes 22 seconds AFTER my friends were served. Food  was sub par not with the wait."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot to stop for a quick lunch. They have really good lunch specials and everything is very authentic. Their spicy fish pot is delicious and I also really enjoy their spicy pork and leek dish. Definitely one of the better Sichuan restaurants in Pittsburgh that I have tried."}
{"text":"This is for takeout/delivery only, but I'm confident that Sichuan Gourmet will be my go-to place for Chinese food from now on. I've tried so many different places around me for Chinese takeout but they've all disappointed - not Sichuan Gourmet! 

I tried the fish fillet in spicy broth (pepper bath) as well as a tame shrimp fried rice. The fried rice was exactly what I wanted - not that hard, yellow excuse you find for fried rice elsewhere. The fish was addictively spicy and salty. It was a little oily and didn't come with much broth (probably because it was takeout), but it went so well with the rice. I'm looking forward to trying more items from the menu."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese place in the entire city! Of course thats not saying a lot b/c Pittsburgh (and PA in general) has such anemic offerings for ethnic food, esp. for a decent-sized city. The decor is like your grandma's kitchen from the nineties with tacky wallpaper and fake plants and pastel-colored seating, and the service is mediocre and is obviously poorly managed, but the food itself is second-to-none at this price point. The key is to avoid the \"American\" menu they offer for basic folks who want to waste their time, and go for the authentic stuff. I highly recommend the giant mushroom with diced taro. The only time I've ever had a truly bad experience was when I ordered takeout and whoever cooked the dish mistook cilantro (an evil weed that should be wiped off the face of the earth) for basil in one of their recipes. I'm sitting there trying to make due before calling the place and waiting another 45 mins for them to remake it properly with basil. But yeah otherwise it's lit."}
{"text":"Chinese restaurants always worry me because you never know what you're gonna get... 

The ambience was nice but the waiters could not speak any concrete English. They would speak some broken English but when we would ask questions, we wouldn't get real answers. 

My friend and I shared the Kung Pao Tofu and sautéed green beans with fresh garlic. We also had mango bubble teas. The Tofu was good! A little tough and needed more sauce though. The green beans were delicious though! I loved those! Just make sure you specifically say \"I want it cooked vegetarian.\" They will add fish sauce if you do not say that. 

My other friends indulged in their hot pots. They ordered a fish hot pot and a shrimp hot pot. They enjoyed the fish hot pot but the shrimp was strange. It was fried with the shells still on... let's just say he didn't like it and it made him sick. 

Try your luck here with the meat but we enjoyed the vegetarian dishes!"}
{"text":"Delicious. I've come here three times now, and had relatively good 
results each time foodwise. Out of the dishes I suggest- Beef noodle soup (huge servings, also spicy despite its 'nonspicy' label), Garlic Eggplant, and Honey BBQ Ribs. Make sure you're ordering off the Chinese/Sichuan menu and not the Americanised one. 

My one issue (other than the fact that almost everything is spicy and their spicy label LIES) is the customer service was horrible the last time I went. It's strange, because the first few times was marked by amazing waitresses, and maybe I just caught one on a bad day. Also, the seafood noodle soup she brought me tasted not nearly as great as the other dishes here. 

Warning: Unless you're like me and addicted to any and all tangcu spareribs, avoid theirs. Tasted like it might have been refried beforehand- slightly dry and stringy, lots of fat on certain parts. The sauce was droolworthy though."}
{"text":"Miserable experience tonight. 

Ordered delivery and was disappointed the minute it walked through the door. 

Sampled: 
Nothing 

Called and returned everything and ordered from someplace else. 

We have ordered from here before, and I have always been a bit disappointed with one or more selections, but tonight was very frustrating. 

All I wanted was an eggroll with homemade duck sauce and hot mustard.  My fiance even repeated it three times on the phone please extra duck sauce and hot mustard.  The delivery guy gets here and not only is there only one duck sauce but no hot mustard. They also didn't send the extra sauce for my shrimp.  

My fiance called back explained the situation and they returned it, but he did have to explain himself multiple times as if he was the one that had done something wrong. 

I might give them a try again, but with all of the quality Chinese food in the area it is unlikely."}
{"text":"Terrific (real) Chinese food--went there for lunch and split an eggplant dish (in a garlic sauce, similar to Ka Mei's but a little spicier) and a flaming pot chicken (with garlic chunks, onion, some other veggies, and a generous helping of hot red pepper).  Also had dumplings with red pepper oil sauce, similarly delicious. I definitely look forward to visiting this place again when I am in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Have been in Pittsburgh for one year. This is my go to chinese restaurant. The food is very authentic and reminds me of home. I especially love the fortune cookie! I come here craving for it.
Best Chinese food in town!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Sichuan food, personally I like fish fillet in boiling spicy broth most. Highly recommended if you are a really chinese food fan"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese cuisine you can get in town. They have a variegated menu, with throughout delicious choices, you cannot make a bad decision here. I went there with friends, and even if two of us do not eat spicy food -which is this place signature-, we were blown away by the non-spicy dishes as well. And if my other friends tell me that the spicy ones were heavenly, I believe them. This place is so popular that you have to wait to get a table, but it is definitely worth it all."}
{"text":"In general I'd rather explore somewhere new than go back to an old familiar spot.  Not so with China Star, i went 2 weeks ago and have been back a total of 3 times since.  Yes it's that good!  They have an american chinese menu and a traditional chinese menu, so be sure to request the authentic one if you have a taste for the exotic.  All their food is good, but I LOVE spicy food and their Szechuan food doesn't pull any punches.  The hot pots in a sizzling pepper broth, are brought out still boiling and are as good as any Schuzuan I've ever had.  They have a huge selection in general, and vegetarians won't have any trouble finding a ton of great options to choose from.  Ordering from here always takes a while, not because of anything wrong with the service, but because it takes so long to scan through the endless menu and narrow it down from all the amazing choices!  Reasonably priced, friendly service and authentic delicious Chinese food.  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"I ordered from them and it LITERALLY 2 hours and 8 minutes to get.  I ordered one chicken entree and an app no substitutions. When it got here the entree tasted like someone sprayed a cleaner in it.  I've never had that happen, hoping I make it through the night"}
{"text":"We religiously eat at the Squirrel hill location whenever we crave for some hot and spicy Sichuan food. We ate at the new location in Oakland to try out the place and surprisingly we found it better than the squirrel hill one- at least the lunch menu was. There was much more choice for $6.99 compared to the $7.50 at the Sq hill location and the portion size for both of our dishes (fish in pickled peppers and homestyle pork) was way too good for lunch menu. Just loved it. Also, cannot complain about the service, it might not be great but it was not bad either. The server filled our glasses with water and coke and also asked us about the food. All in all, it was a great experience and we would love to go back to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"The cashier girl, whose name is Jade, really gave us a hard time. Our waitress wrongly redeemed two coupons( 15 bucks value ea) when we paid the bill separately. Then, the cashier girl came and placed the blame on us, like we tried to take advantage of her. Finally, she redeemed our another coupon(25 bucks value) and no apologies for their mistake. Terrible experience. 
Btw, we ordered shrimp hot pot and the shrimps weren't fresh."}
{"text":"So to start my rant ill begin with this: the only gourmet thing about szechuan gourmet is in the name.  The best part of my meal was the check with 2 sticks of gum included, which we only received after my girlfriend shouted to the group of waitresses wrapping birthday gifts behind the counter.

Next, the service was mediocre at best.  Our waitress never once checked in to see how our meal was or if it could be improved in any way.  Also, a simple substitution of fried rice for white rice seemed to be impossible.  

As for the food the chicken ordered was chewey, spongey, and somehow stringy.  

Yes they were clean as in mopping the floors with what I would guess to be 90% bleach.  While they were mopping my nose hairs would burn with every breath.  

Overall, never eating here again.  The nine dollar buffet up the street is way more appetizing."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom Nom ... 

This place is delightful!  As a hardcore Thai fan I frequently shun Chinese food.  Mostly because I feel the bland ameri-chinese is greasy and unsatisfying.  This place however blew me away with their authentic Sichuan food!  Who knew Chinese food was this good!  Damn those restaurants that try to placate the American palate!  The millions of dried red chillies that were scattered through a pan of flaming fish, calling to me with their flavorful, spicy, and tender meat that had layers and layers of flavor.  This place is just around the corner from us, so we'll definitely be keeping it as a go to.  Tip - You'll have to ask for the Sichuan menu, they won't automatically give it to you.  Also the servers will give you plenty of tips on what is good, and what are the most popular dishes that people order."}
{"text":"The food here was very flavorful and delicious! They also served us very quickly. The menu is translated into English and Chinese. The environment is also clean and nice"}
{"text":"My dish was not listed as described. There was no broccoli in the triple flavor shrimp. And it was$15 plus delivery costs got a very small portion. Not impressed. I've been to China and this is not authentic. Not to mention I'm from NY so have had much better experiences for a much lower price. Go to How Lee in the same area.... It's Americanized but better portions and good flavor."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times and never had an experience where I left the restaurant unhappy. I specially like the Chongqing? chicken and the dry fish. The quantity they offer is good for the price. In my opinion, the quantity they serve for one order is sufficient for two people.

Tip: i just got to know from the waitress here that if you have any issue with your food, dont wait until you are half way through it, let them know immediately and they will change it for you."}
{"text":"Outstanding. Reasonably priced. Had Sichuan beef, and wontons in red chili oil as an appetizer. My wife had sweet & sour chicken from the American menu. This is about as Chinese as you're going to get here. The beef didn't taste spicy hot at first but the fire built slowly and lingered satisfyingly after I finished; it didn't overwhelm the sliced green peppers. The sweet & sour chicken was good but it was  humbled to suit Occidental tastes. The best choices are outside of the American portion of the menu.

Simple. Satisfying. Very good. You have to ask for silverware because the tables are set with chopsticks which I am happy to use. We'll be back."}
