{"text":"Came on a tuesday for half price wings, very worth your money. Obviously had to wait a little while, especially since the world cup was on TV. 

Ordered the:
Garlic Parmesan- the best one, deep fried chicken covered in galric parmesan sauce... Drool inducing just thinking about it

Sweet Chilli Sriracha - when i saw 'sriracha' I just knew I had to order it. It had a great kick to it! Actually spicy and delicious, saucy fried chicken is awesome. 

Franks Red Hot Dry Rub - was really dry and not spicy at all. 

I guess the wings in general were quite dry but if you get a saucy one, it makes it alright.  Came with fries as well. 

I wouldnt go on a normal night and pay full price, but half price tuesdays is worth a visit every now and then."}
{"text":"I have been a St. Louis fan for years dating back to the nineties when there were just two locations. What stood out then was their wings and fries and their signature dipping sauce. Fantastic! Not like any wings you have ever had. 

I went to this location just yesterday after a years-long drought and was not disappointed. The wings and fries are exactly as they have been for at least 25 years and this time there was no wait in a too small crowded restaurant as used to be the case at Bistro on Avenue Road those many years ago. I am certain that the other food on the menu is very good too. It's just that for me, the wings are not to be missed and so I never have.

Food: Excellent
Staff: Superb
Atmosphere: Sports bar comfortable and not too loud

Do I recommend this location (and the food this franchise offers)?

Unequivocally YES!

P.S. It seems that this location was closed at some point a few years ago and so there was some doubt as to whether it still existed. I don't know the history but I can assure you that it has been open now (January, 2017) for a little under a year and it is very new looking."}
{"text":"Decent location, usually packed though. Favourite drink hands down is the jolly rancher"}
{"text":"honey garlic chicken wings, that's all I have to say."}
{"text":"I love St Louis with all my heart because of their suicide sauced wings. I've been to lots of wing and rib places but no one compares to this suicide sauce. There's a bit of tang just enough to make it sour and enough spice to make you crave more. Yum! If you're not one for spice their other flavors are great too. All the wings come with a side of fries and garlic ranch sauce which is so much better than veggies and dip than most places give you. If you want u can substitute that for an extra wing.

Definitely try their ribs (ayce on certain days). They're nice and moist and the meat falls right off the bone. Apps are pretty good too (especially on half price Thursday's).

Look oh for certain specials they have like wing and rib combos. Sometimes getting a half rack of ribs with 4 wings and fries is cheaper than getting 6 wings!

Service is usually really good at this location. Pretty much everyone young is really nice there. Do beware of an older brunette lady who tends the bar and serves. She rarely comes back to your table and makes you wait forever for everything; maybe its just me but she's also really rude towards Asians in general.

Overall st Louis is one of the best places in Toronto plus they're all over the place. Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"I just want to point out that the food and service is so bad, that it's compelling me to write this review before I've even left. Ordered a Pepsi that was so flat it tasted like I was just drinking syrup and water. That sort of thing does happen, but when I told the waitress she was rude about it. The food price to portion ratio was off ($23 for two pounds of wings and literally 15 fries or so). When we pointed out the portion issue, our server, she quickly dismissed the topic by walking away while I was still speaking. Service is completely lacking. Also, one waitress during Sunday night football?! To top it all off, even the water had a foul taste. Oh, and I'm not done - I've been waiting over 40 mins to even ask for our bill, hence why I've had time to write this review. I've eaten at many restaurants in countries around the world and have never been treated like this. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"The food here is disgusting. Literally every item is cheese or meat, so forget ordering anything else. It's over cooked and stale tasting. Service takes forever. If there is a jays game it's insanely busy and service is the worst, but because it's the only place down here it thrives. It wouldn't survive any area with competition."}
{"text":"Had the wings. All you can eat for 20. Hot and sweet Asian and Buffalo were tops. Great beer specials, plenty on tap. Nice atmosphere with many TVs. I will be back during my next trip to Toronto. Also... A lot of eye candy. Always a bonus."}
{"text":"It's a really good place to go after work to watch the game or just grab a bite. It's the kind of place that you can become a local really quick. 

There's a special everyday as well which helps in getting people together. The servers are nice and the food is decent at an affordable enough price."}
{"text":"Came in really late one night, about 40 minutes before they closed and they were nice enough to accommodate us even though there were at least 25 of us and only 2 waitresses left. Very friendly staff and the food was quick but at the expense of its quality. It wasn't bad, but nothing special. I got the small St. Louis Chicken Wing Poutine and it was reeeaaallly small. 

Other than the size of the poutine, it's a great place to go with friends, especially to watch sports games and catch up over some wings!"}
{"text":"I am really do love places who offer AYCE wings and I was excited to go there. I have to say I was very disappointed with the whole experience. My wings were very over cooked and the sauces were just ok. The wait time in between refills for my wings was 20 mins each time and when I did get my order it was 8 wings at a time. I was at that restaurant for a very time and still even though I could have as many as I wanted I still left a little hungry. The waitress never asked me if I wanted a refill I had to as her which was strange because she clearly saw my basket was empty. The person I was with had an iced tea which was very flat as well. I am really sad to say it but this place wont see me again, I hear good things about it and when Wingmania came up I was excited but now I regret it.....damn because I do love my chicken wings."}
{"text":"Wings to die for.. Devi's Pint of Canadian. Good service inspite of being busy.. Great night. Will come back for sure"}
{"text":"Their promos are great! Also I forgot my phone and they kept it safe for me so I'm happy.  Enough TVs to watch your favorite sporting events but not too many to be in your face."}
{"text":"Have gone to the St. Louis at York Mills and the one near Yonge Finch for years.  Never had any issues.  Am sitting here at the one on Dufferin where I ordered a mandarin chicken salad and my husband got a buffalo Caesar wrap.  Not only did the food take an exceptionally long time to arrive, (there were only about 6 other people who ordered after us) but the portions were off.  There were barely any fries on the wrap plate and barely any dressing on the salad.  I mentioned it to the waitress who said different locations do different portions.  Not acceptable.  She ended up having the fries topped off for my husband.  Won't come here again, sticking to the other locations."}
{"text":"The art of bartending and serving food is not that complicated. Be attentive, constantly observe your customers to see if they need booze or more food and smile from ear to ear. They have failed to to all! tips should not be expected, but rather earned. This all points to poor management. I didn't like the service but food was good. cheers"}
{"text":"Went to catch a Leaf game on Saturday night for a few \"pops\" with a friend, and was surprised to walk into what seemed to be a tiny place that was packed full. Managed to get a table in the corner, but it took nearly 10 mins for a waitress to recognize us (she even cleared the plates at the table beside us before acknowledging us!). Even though I haven't been in the summer, I gave 3 Stars because they patio looked fairly large and would probably be a good place along Queen St. on a hot summer day. From the looks of the menu, typical subpar bar food offered."}
{"text":"I like this place, They re hotter then hell wings are very good, their track suit shots go down wayyy to easy, and they re cheap!.( The track suit shot). The bartentors will mix you up anything just tell them what you want in it and they wiil come up with something. I like the fact that it is very casual, and they have the nice big tvs you can see anywhere you sit. They re ceasers are too pricey for the quailty. I find they put to much ice in them and it just tastes watered down. Dont bother buying for the extra shot of vokda because it dosen't make much difference.  I'll go agin for their wings anyday."}
{"text":"I'm really addicted to their dill dipping sauce that i decided to buy the bottle of sauce for my own uses at home, yummy! But talking about the chicken here, i personally thought it was great! The sizes of the wings may not have been as big and meatys as compared to Duff's Wings but i think the flavour was definetly better. When ordering the flavour 'Suicide' at Louis, you don't just get the hot burning sensation but you also get the flavour of it, I remember ordering a bowl of spicy wings at Duff's and it was more of a salty and VERY HOT flavour that i felt like i was killing my tastebuds, BLEH! still remember like it was yesterday. All and all, my favourite flavour is the Sweet Asian BBQ, it's tangy and sooo good! while the fries are thick-cut and crispy (fries are hardly every crispy when they're thick so this is #1!), they taste amazing with the dill sauce! (oh goossh, im drooling) The ribs were A-OK in my book, not a bad flavour and very soft and tender! I think i'll always be a fan of Louis Wings. yeah most definetly! (:"}
{"text":"Walked in for lunch, got seated right away but the place was freezing. Just ordered a pound of wings and water to drink. Water came first obviously.. noticed a fruit fly in there. Requested to change it and waitress goes \"yeah we have lots in here\". 15 mins later my wings came.. ate about 3 fries and noticed something sticking out. Decided to pull it out and it was long piece of hair about 25 cm long. Notified the manager, got up and left to go to jackasstors down the street."}
{"text":"What a waist of a location. They have east of spadina on lockdown. Bartenders were eating as they served you. Unbelievable. The wings are their bread and butter and they aren't bad. The burger was dry and tasted like it might have been out for a little too long. No personality, no respect for the customer. Not a well managed operation."}
{"text":"This bar has a small cozy/comfortable feel to it. It also has a patio. The menu has so much variety besides the popular wings and ribs. They now have breaded pickles and fish tacos too! If you have room dessert you must try the Lindt Chocolate ice cream cake. So yummy and filling. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waitress did not even introduce herself and was so brief with us it seemed like she didn't even want to serve us. When our drinks needed refills no one was there to take care of that and when we tried looking for our server she was no where to be found. Our food also took awhile to come. The wings were okay, but the fries came out soggy. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great either.

Wings are good, suds are good.  If you want to take advantage of the half-price Tuesday wing special, this is a good spot to do it.  But I wouldnt order a full meal here.

This restaurant has one of the most diverse mix of clientele I've ever seen.  At first, it was intriguing, but we eventually stopped going because of the unpredicatbility.  One night it will be all seniors... another all familes with children... another thugs.  On that night, we almost watched a fight break out.  That might not sound all that scary, but if you've ever been inside this restaurant, you realize there's really NO room for that kind of thing.  Couples sit at tables within elbow distance of barflies.  

The food is, however, consistent.  Service is not.  The waitresses are distracted and consistenly mildly patronizing (in a bad way).   Don't sit in the patio section... its a sauna no matter the time of year (in the winter, the heaters blow directly on diners).

I more I write, the more I remember why we changed locations.  I should stop."}
{"text":"Came here for Tuesday half-price wings, and were not disappointed.  For a chain restaurant, this location is very unassuming.  Loads of interior space, and ample parking.  Music is good and not overbearing.  Staff are pleasant, effecient, and quick.  Food was great, and we had lots of tvs to watch the game on.  Tons of free parking.

Will have to go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Generally, I really enjoy my time at St Louis. Their fries and dill sauce are the star of the show, even though the wings are very descent too! The service is always incredible with fun people ready to get you whatever you need or might be missing.

 My girlfriend went to sleep early while watching a show, so I decided to sneak out for some wings! What I experienced Friday night is nothing short of training day. There was 3 girls on site, as i came in I was hastily seated with a new menu (maybe not so new, its been a year since my last trip here) and pried for what i wanted to drink. I just sat down, please get me some water. The menu, again, really confusing to read, took me a while to decipher where the wing prices and flavours were, and what their drink specials were. I considered getting a drink, but after seeing a couple half poured pints under the taps, I considered against it. The waitress made her round and took my order, then proceed to hang out with the other waitress/bartender behind the bar laughing at pictures and text msgs with a few patrons at the bar. Meanwhile, poor girl number three is walking around in circles, in what I presumed to be, the only way someone can get a hold of staff without walking up to the bar, ripping the cellphone out of their hands and smashing it into the ground. Wings came, as always they were awesome, hence why this joint got the 2 stars. No one came around after I got the wings, I guess I ate in peace?

TL;DR service was terrible, menu confusing, wings n fries still awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is disgustingly dirty. I ordered chicken wings and got food poisoning...

Once I asked around I heard food from this place is notorious for making people sick.
The waitresses are dusty and rude. Go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"Best wings and fries in town Love the environment.
Definitely recorded this place"}
{"text":"The service was really great, easy going yet attentive. The Bacon wrapped Mac n Cheese appetizer is a must try  Really enjoyed the boneless wings (tried Buffalo and Cajun), and also the Tostada salad hit the spot. If you're feeling like wings and want great service, this is the joint."}
{"text":"If you live on yonge between Shepard and finch this is a good place to grab a beer and watch the game with friends. It can be quite busy here on weekends and weeknights. Food here is the same as other bars: fries, poutine, burgers and wings."}
{"text":"OMG the food was so cold and it took forever to bring it. Worse place I ever been to. Never comming back. Don't choose this location of St.  Louise ever! No wonder it was totally dead"}
{"text":"This place is wack.

Seriously, I've been here what 20 times... and 19 of them (maybe 12) were
actually \"open only to staff.\"

For 2-3 years, I'd walk by and think... maybe I should go in... but I recall, that even I don't hate myself that much. 

First of all, it's not a good place.
Secondly, don't waste my time.

Back when I was downing vodka like a Russian mobsta, I wasn't in the mood for your rude, cow-ish looks.
Also, if I went outside to smoke for a second... clearly, I'd be back to pay.

If I was nostalgic I'd say I met my first few Toronto friends here, and it \"holds a special place in my heart.\"
But, I'm not that much of a loser.

St. Louis Bar & Grill... I only ever returned to any... because of proximity to a friend. 

It only exists --- because nothing else is here.

Look around, most businesses here closed.
TD, the Tuck Shop, Spot...


I am not even sure how this place survives... I've seen far better bar areas in many of the apartments nearby. 

No offense, but you are a waste of space. 
Rating: Zero Stars."}
{"text":"I'm from Richmond Hill so I've tried the other St. Louis location on Yonge.. But this location is by far a better experience.  The restaurant is new and clean.  The staff is very friendly and helpful and the owner always comes by to talk to guests and make sure they're having a positive experience.  Love the food, the people and the atmosphere, great place to watch a game!!"}
{"text":"I am sure the wings are good, but last night we went to watch the hockey game and ordered the Nachos.. bad idea!! They are horrible!! Not sure where they got there recipe from but it wasn't a chef!! Who puts mounds of lettuce on nachos?? 
Anyways, I complained and they asked me if I would like something else instead, as they agreed that they were terrible...
These guys really need to get out of the kitchen and take a look at what other restaurants do for food (especially Nachos) .."}
{"text":"Asked for a water couple of times and the waitress didn't even care. At the end she added soda to my bill and I didn't even ordered soda. luckily I checked my bill. will never go back again."}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday night, in dire need of a chicken wing fix.  The place was relatively empty. With it being in the financial district, which is commonly deserted on weekends, this wasn't a surprise. We were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in.

Our server was very helpful and polite. We opted for 2 lbs of wings with added fries - about $22 and feeds two people. The saucy Buffalo wings were absolutely delicious, 10/10 would recommend, but the Sriracha wings were not quite as flavorful. Dipping those wings in the garlic ranch sauce is just amazing if your waistline can afford it. The fries are also great - thick cut and cooked perfectly. No complaints about the food at all!

The only suggestion I have is to offer more choices of wing sauces. You have to keep in mind, though, that this is a classic bar/grill with more than just wings, not a wings specialty restaurant (i.e. wild wing).

Price was alright - we ordered 3 rounds of drinks and our bill ended up around $60 by the time we stumbled out. Definitely got our wing fix and will be going back!"}
{"text":"Great service and food exactly as you'd expect.

The patio is great during pleasant weather."}
{"text":"I always grab takeout here- deep fried pickles and wings which I love!! I get Caribbean jerk wings  ugh amazing. Don't order the boneless chicken wings, their waaay over fried here- so hard and doesn't taste good. Other St. Louis have amazing boneless chicken wings and they were my fav but having them once here sucked and ruined it for me.  Other then that whenever I order it's always great! :)"}
{"text":"This place had a great location right by the Roger's Centre.  I went around the 1st inning of a Blue Jays game and it thankfully wasn't packed at this point.  As a result, our service was alright since it wasn't that full.

The wings were pretty good but they got sort of greasy at the bottom.  I had one of the salads and it was surprisingly good and also pretty sizeable."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant manager of all St. Louis locations... By far; impolite, no welcoming attitude and for sure do NOT care about customer satisfaction, think he is not even aware of the term!!!!! Unable to accomodate customers with the simplest request of putting 2 tables together, just 2 tables not the walls... U hear me?!! Awful 
Waitresses are very nice though don't get me wrong"}
{"text":"I am almost a regular there since they've open. 

Great service but sometimes slow. But the food is great, the servers are nice and the price is right."}
{"text":"If I could find deep fried pickles elsewhere (and as convenient a location for me), I would never go here. Why? The service is almost always terrible. After nearly 15 minutes of being completely ignored and overlooked, I started to worry that I had suddenly turned invisible. We were even ignored as the server wiped down our table! No \"I'll be right back to take your order\" or \"sorry for the wait\" - until my face could no longer hide my fury. Then it was excuse after excuse. I completely understand if it's a busy night, or if you're short staffed - just please acknowledge my presence, even in the slightest, so I know I'm not invisible. As we waited we watched another couple get fed up with being invisible and walk out the door (two servers who were chatting with one another watched them leave and didn't appear regretful in the slightest). The only reason I go here (and gave it 2 stars) is for the deep fried pickles which are usually really good, but on this particular visit, there were 2 less spears than usual, and 2 of them were undercooked (the breading was doughy, and not crispy). They also filled the bottom half of the container with a ridiculous amount of shredded lettuce - I guess so we wouldn't notice we were being short-changed on the pickles?

Since the pickles left us unsatisfied, we were hungry for dessert. But there are no dessert prices listed on the menu (and this area can be pricier than usual). When we asked our server she did not know how much they were and left for several minutes before she came back with an answer. And it was another 20 min. until she came back to ask if we wanted to order dessert, which we did 20 min. earlier, but since we were officially fed up, we asked for the bill instead.

If you like deep fried pickles, more often than not, St. Louis does them right. Just maybe try a different location."}
{"text":"Delicious poutine. Drinks were good. Don't recommend the cucumber mojito though. They were seriously under staffed since I saw our server take almost every table so service was subpar. Not his fault, so I'm giving them a review mostly based on the food & drinks, and the very good looking host"}
{"text":"Firstly, the service was quite terrible, I ordered from just eat and it was an hour late and the employees working could not even tell us where it was or when it was coming. I also specifically said no cheese because I am lactose intolerant as well as vegan and they still put the cheese on the burger. When the food arrived it was cold and I will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"It was pretty good! I only had the wings, and I thought they were delicious. The honey garlic was my favourite. But generally honey garlic at all places are delicious for me so I don't know what that means. Overall just based on my one visit I would recommend it. It seems like a nice place and the staff were friendly :)"}
{"text":"The only thing I ever get from here is their wings. I get the order with 6 (or is it 9?) wings, honey garlic style, with fries. The star of the show is their dill pickle dip, which I understand you can buy in bottles. I usually buy an extra dip for my wings as well. The meal goes great with a pint of steamwhistle, and always leaves me satisfied. Service usually friendly and efficient. Just don't go to the one at Cityplace after a big game at the Rogers Centre! Huuuuge crowds and line ups!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to lots of St Louis but this one sucks the manager is a jerk my BF found a hair in his wings and this jerk manager would not replace his wings.  Also he was rude and completely against gay people. This Danforth St Louis HATES GAY PEOPLE! ..."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the look at the front of this bar...food and service are excellent!  Great selection of food choices, and of course their wings are what they are known for.  Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"don't bother coming here for the following reasons we experienced

- long waits to be served it wasn't that busy
- single order of 2lb wings, we were charged for 2 orders
- there were no ketchup bottles on any of the empty tables, we asked for ketchup, waitress comes back with ONE take out packet of ketchup
- very little salsa came with the nachos we asked for more and was charged extra without being told when we asked."}
{"text":"This place is kind of a whole in the wall so to speak. They are built into a buisness complex. The place is rarely busy since it's some what out of the way and there is no real parking around the area. 

I find the staff alright but the service was slow which is unusual since the place wasn't busy and the food was ok but I don't think I would make this place a regular thing."}
{"text":"St. Louis Wings has been around since 2002 but have really expanded in the past few years. I went with two friends for dinner at the Bloor and Brunswick location.

I generally never need to look at the menu when I go to any joint touting \"wings\" in their name. I started with the bacon wrapped mac and cheese which were quite tasty. A full strip of bacon wrapped around a mac and cheese ball. Confirming the idea that bacon wrapped anything is going to be tasty.

I ordered the mississippi honey BBQ flavored wings at the suggestion of our server. The sauce was good and the fries which were large and done in a ruffled style were the unexpected treat of the meal. The wings however were more than underwhelming. They were small, lacking meat and the over all taste was about on par with grocery store frozen wings. 

St. Louis Wings is an average bar and grill franchise in a category with Kelsey's, Casey's, and Jack Aster's. They should probably take a page from these restaurants and drop the \"wings\" out of their name... or change the name to St. Louis Fries (honestly quite good)."}
{"text":"Amazing place, amazing stuff and the food is soo good.  Highly recommend it to everyone to visit."}
{"text":"1 Star because of putting me there waiting for 10mins with my hands waving ask for orders"}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday which is half priced wings, which meant there were a lot of customers with a lot of demands. My friend and I both ordered a pound of wings each, but it took much too long. On top of that, my dry rub Cajun wings were quite burnt (but as it was very busy, I didn't bother asking for a new one). However, our server was very nice and hardworking!"}
{"text":"Food is always good here! I find the service is normally good, unless you catch them on a really busy night! Only issue I have had is, I'm female I go in with my boyfriend mostly. A few girls I have notice pay more attention to tables with old men/just men.. Why I think is because they think if they pay attention to the drooling males.  Wearing such short skirts they think they will get a better tip... I tip according to my Meal & Service I don't know about anyone else maybe just me..."}
{"text":"This is the worst St.Louis location ever. I am writing this review after 2 consecutive disappointing visits. Both times, I have requested take out for wings. I specifically asked to have the fries separated and they said they could do that. I went to pick up my 4 lbs of wings and when i walked in and went to the pickup desk, a girl just stood there without a greet until another girl came and nudged her. I asked if the fries were separated and they said YES. I asked for extra st louis dill sauce and she said she would charge me $0.83 per extra sauce. Money is never an issue. I said fine, but i was bitter at their poor service. She went to charge me but she charges me $0.83 when i have asked for 3 extra sauces. She hands me the ONE sauce and we have to do the transaction all over again with the debit machine. Now, I want you to know this was all happening while she is giving me dirty looks as if she is annoyed at my simple requests. I leave the place furious only to find out that my fries are not separate. I was already on the way home and I did not want to go back and deal with that girl. I hope you are reading this St.Louis North York. You need better trained staff who at least have basic common courtesy and a brain."}
{"text":"Ugh ... seldom write reviews but I thought I'd pen a warning to those who might be considering this place.  Wings were terrible (!) and the service was unfriendly.  The lack of patrons justified my sentiments."}
{"text":"I've come here before on two other occasions, food was average, mistakes were made with the order and waitresses lacked the ability to attend to their tables efficiently. 3 weeks ago, on my LAST EVER visit to this location I was completely surprised by how much worse it was. My boyfriend and I went on a Tuesday and they had several tables which were available but just needed to be cleaned. Nobody cleaned them for about 20 minutes, so nobody was seated. In addition to this no staff attended to the crowd of patrons waiting by the door to be seated. We waited about half an hour until my boyfriend finally decided to go walk around and ask a waitress. She told him there was a wait list and that he would be #5 on the list. Then some minutes later when the manager came out, she called out over 7 group names but not ours. In addition to this, a man at the bar was waiting for about 6-7 other friends to come (was a party of 10) but they weren't there yet so he insisted that she hold the table for another 15 minutes while he waits at the bar sitting drinking his beer. When I heard this I told my boyfriend this is ridiculous when there's a wait line they can't just hold tables like that and that we should just leave. Then the most surprising and insulting thing happened. The manager comes up to me in a condescending, challenging tone, and says \"oh I don't know how to manage this restaurant? Well then why don't you tell me how to run it!\" I tell her how long we had wait and that we were told we were supposed to be group #5 on the wait list and she tells me no we have \"pages\" ahead of you-no apologies, and still continues to challenge me. Needless to say I have NEVER been to a professional establishment where the workers-especially manager- speak to you like this. We will never be back at this location ever again. We instead went to the one at sheppard (yes a far trip due to lack of professionalism) knowing this location is always a perfect experience. Don't waste time, money, or effort on this extremely small Richmond Hill location."}
{"text":"What a look !! Drunk alcoholics at the bar singing stupid songs so loud when we are trying to have a meal. This is not a family restaurant"}
{"text":"Tuesday half price wings can't be beaten. Best value wings in the T.O period!! **As long as you can a table. 4 out of 5"}
{"text":"Have been to this location about 20 times. I swore off it a few years ago because the service in the daytime (lunch) was not great.

I decided to post this review because I returned for a tuesday ''1/2 price' special (was meeting a friend and this location is much closer to him than the new one on 16th/leslie).

the main reason for this review is that the wings are now tiny. I'm not sure if this is because of the rising price of all meat in the market - or maybe they use different wings on tuesdays because its 1/2 price -either way I find it unacceptable. I wish i took a pic.

the service was actually noticeably better. the waitress took our orders quickly, and returned multiple times to check on our meal and whether we needed refills on beverages."}
{"text":"St. Louis has the best wings and fries by far! You won't find another wing joint that gives you fries with their pound + their dill sauce is to die for! My favourite is the sweet asian bbq but I also love their suicide wings for when I'm in a \"spicy\" mood. Their menu is extensive (also LOVE their mandarin chicken salad), prices are great, and servers are super attentive and friendly. Go on Tuesdays for 1/2 price wing nights or Thursdays for 1/2 price appetizers. So GOOD and great for students on a budget! Thanks St. Louis for a great time!"}
{"text":"**** I just WON the \"Wings for a Year\" contest out of 4,000+ people for St. Louis Bar and Grill which is SUPPOSED to be available for redemption at Any of their restaurants. *****

{"text":"Wasn't going to write a review, but after seeing all the negative ones I had to chime in (and by God, I wish I'd read them before going here).
In a nutshell... went here on Friday night with two friends and had chicken strips. Frankly, they tasted like (and had the texture of) rubber. I don't like to complain, so by my own stupidity, I continued eating.
Saturday morning I felt nauseous and had a pounding headache. Went into the bathroom and threw up (could still taste the chicken).
I will NEVER eat here again."}
{"text":"I used to like the wings but they are pricey considering that every time I go there they seemed to get smaller and smaller, the only thing they got going for them is the dipping sauce. I don't go anymore. I found a better spot."}
{"text":"The St. Louis has a nice interior with lots of televisions. The chicken wings are tasty and crispy. I definitely would recommend their wings poutine it has tons of flavour and they give it in large portions! (If you order it bring someone with you)"}
{"text":"Saw a mouse/rat scurry, fruit fly was in my drink and some flying around our other drinks, and we waited to be even introduced to our server for about 15 minutes -- we tried to be patient and asked politely to a nearby server cleaning up if anyone was assigned our table."}
{"text":"In the style of 'know what you can do, do it, and do it well' Great sports bar with wings and ribs. Take along a few friends, get a beer or two, or three a whole stack of wings or ribs, and chill Great evening out. Watch the sports on the various screens if you like, but the sound is down so they're not at all intrusive."}
{"text":"Not a bad bar but certainly not great and can't really compete with their Davisville/ Yonge & Eg location.

In a neighbourhood strip of small independent shops, restaurants, and bars, as strange as it sounds, it can be refreshing to have something mainstream to go to every once and awhile.  

I find the service to be quite good but the food to be blah at best but admittedly that doesn't keep me from staying away.  They do have some decent specials each night so for an evening of beers and some wings, it's not a bad choice.

It's unfortunate there isn't much of a patio area - I wonder if all the empty space along Logan was meant to be a designated outdoor area.

Anyway, wouldn't make this a destination place, rather if you want something simple and expected, then it's alright and.. they accommodate kids which is good for us parents that want to have a few beers without worrying about keeping the kids settled."}
{"text":"The chicken wing was cold even the sandwich and the service was so poor ! Won't come here again!"}
{"text":"Imagine being in the bathroom right after you had a case of explosive diarrhea from under-cooked chicken... That ladies and gents, is still a much better option than being in this sorry place. 

Food was terrible, service was non-existent and the owner looked like he was overdue for a nice beating to the face.  Came in to order some fish tacos, 50 mins later, had a plate of soggy shells and a mixture of foul tart like substances.  After barely finishing one, I called for the bill.  This is where it got interesting.  The waitress, for reasons unknown, refused to bring it.  She must have felt my misery and decided 50 mins was not enough suffering for my gentle soul.  A cruel creature this one was, fitting for such a nasty place. 

Unless you are a masochist who enjoys pain and suffering, DO NOT, for the sake of your humanity, ever visit this place.  STAY FAR AWAY!!"}
{"text":"The wings are not like they used to be way back before they sold franchises. The service is hit or miss and the management is a definite miss. That little bald guy knows f_all about hospitality. Don't waste your time or money.There are far better wing joints nearby. (McSorleys or Crown & Dragon)"}
{"text":"For a place that claims to be all about wings, the wings are anemic and not very tasty. Still, it does the job in a pinch"}
{"text":"St louis bar and grill is a popular pub chain in Toronto. It's nice for big groups, they got a big menu, price is average, got good selection of ribs and wings. 

Definitely not bad...but I'd say if you are looking for some more unique beer/draft, this is not the place you'd want to go for.  Their tap are mostly (if not all) canadian beer...  and very limited choices. I was disappointed that they don't have MGD...

In terms food, wings are okay...standard I guess. They provide wet naps, which is bonus!  For ribs, I think they are a bit dry (at least at the church & king location).
Fries are awesome, and the ice-cream cake that we got at one time was good too !"}
{"text":"If you live and/or work within a short walking distance of this place, as I do, it isn't so bad.  Otherwise, there is literally no reason to eat or drink here.

It's your typical sports bar.  They have a patio.  I sat outside on a nice mild spring evening.  The music outside was a bit too loud for my taste, but it wasn't a huge problem.

I had the angus bacon cheeseburger (with jalapeños added) with fries.  Another Yelper recommended the garlic dill dip, so I got some of that with the fries.

The burger was passable.  The bacon was a little overdone.  The fries were also passable.  They were cut an an interesting crinkle pattern.  The dip was good.  I had a 24oz draught Molson Canadian.  It was cold and beer.

In brief, St. Louis Bar & Grill is right next to my condo and office."}
{"text":"Really fast service and a good portion of wings.

We were a party of two and were attended to quickly when we entered. We asked to sit on the patio but later changed our mind when the Sun changed direction. Our waitress was still helpful in getting us set up inside."}
{"text":"Today, I'm a wing hermit with a sports fetish.  Sports are here with 9 television screens inside a space of no more than 800 sq ft. and the hermit crab in me loves to get away on a weekday night at about 9pm when this location is almost always empty.

Alas, today is a Friday and the 14 (ish) tables are clucking with happy people (very few chicks though).

Go for the bone-in wings, honey garlic and sweet chili heat are great.  While St. Louis on York Mills is not my go-to for a romantic dinner and also not a gastro-pub experience... it's got friendly staff and a quiet atmosphere on weekdays."}
{"text":"Last night, my family and I visited St.Louis Bar and Grill for the first time and were highly disappointed by both the food and the service. We arrived at around 9pm and it was relatively busy. After placing our order, the appetizers arrived in a long-awaited 40 minutes (the remainder of our food came in intervals of 15 minutes). In this time, my dad light-heartedly asked our waiter about the food in a joking manner and each time he did, the waiter responded dryly, \"Just wait\". Later on in the night, my dad attempted to call our waiter for a refill but seeing as how he was far away and the place being as loud as it was, he clapped a few times in order to get his attention. Our waiter returned with a confused look on his face and without even asking what it was that we needed first, he felt the need to lecture my dad in etiquette by telling him, \"You shouldn't clap, it's very rude\". The gesture was not meant to be one with that intent; it was solely a way of grabbing his attention when he couldn't hear us the first time. The waiter commenting on the matter in such a condescending tone, on top of the cold, unfriendly service we received all night was in my eyes, far ruder than anything we as the customers had done. 

As for the food, we ordered their onion rings and butter chicken bruschetta bread to start. The onion rings were merely chopped up squares of onion that had been deep-fried and the bruschetta bread was a mock imitation of a pizza - both were subpar. For the main course, we ordered the 2lb. wings in both spicy honey garlic and barbecue flavour. The spicy honey garlic tasted a lot fresher and the sauce had more body to it than the barbecue wings. My guess is that the more 'unique' flavours have to be prepared on the spot whereas the ever so popular choices such as the barbecue are prepared in bulk beforehand. As a result, the barbecue wings were incredibly dry and the sauce had the consistency of something that had been reheated three times. All in all, I assume the food is pretty standard across different locations, but I truly hope that the waiter in question either improves his attitude or is the exception of the chain."}
{"text":"I normally have mediocre experience at this chain of restaurants but in a new part of the city when I'm really hungry mediocre is better than unknown. This location fell short on all counts, maybe my standards have gone up or their standards have slipped.

The service was slow, forgetful and obviously confused. We were told to sit wherever we chose and then no server was seen for the next 20 minutes, this forgetful service continued throughout the night.

The food was even more mediocre than I remember, the wings at this location were extremely small, overcooked and oversalted; to put the size in perspective I normally can't finish 1.5lbs of wings at any other restaurant but here I went through 2lbs with no problem. The fries stood out however as a good point on the night. The drinks we ordered were less than expertly mixed and left a lot to be desired. Overall to eat and drink here for two it cost upwards of $60 and at that price range it could not compete with many wing/bar spots in Toronto."}
{"text":"Nice place.  We went in for lunch and the service was great.  I loved their fries and dip.  My daughter loved the wings.  Will certainly go again."}
{"text":"Brought my daughter here a few times because she likes wings and goes here with her friends.  I found the wings were very dry and seemed like they just slapped hot sauce and mixed it with out warming up the wings.   Fries had a greasy taste."}
{"text":"Went here for wingsanity. Wasn't all too satisfied with the quality. Went the second time to watch raptors playoffs and got some actual wings. It can get busy because it's near Rogers center so be prepared for some wait."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times in the last 6 months 
It seems to get worse and worse.... many items are hit and miss except the fries... they are always good!
I've had wings there on cheap wing night and regular days where I pay full pop for a pound of wings 
On regular days u can expect a nice set of wings.... on cheap nights be prepared for some questionable looking \"wings\" ... to the point u shake your head at how they can even serve that to a customer or just flat out get disgusted from them 
Got a pound last time I was there 9 pcs... out of the 9 pieces 3 were utterly disgusting 
Also ordered the small Caesar salad and paid 3.99 to add a chicken breast.... the bring out my salad with hardly any chicken.  So I decided to ask how they charge 3.99 for this much chicken... she said let me find out.
She returns and tells me that because I ordered the a small Caesar salad that I get half the chicken breast! 
I said so if I order a large salad and breast I would get the full breast? She said yes...  so I said that's cool but you still charge me full pop on the breast and she said yes!
So.... to try to please me she gave me the rest of the breast that I fully paid for and 3 new wings to replace my 3 disgusting ones 
Most places would discount and add more wings or just give u a full order of wings but (getting to my point) they are extremely cheap! They are hardly busy and that's not a shocker cause the food is majority of the time under par and I feel that they just try to cut corners to save 
I most likely will not be going to this location ever again unless there's a big game on and every other bar is fully packed and there's no seats... then I would consider trying it again 
The waitress and staff are really nice and helpful but I feel bad for them cause they rely on tips and with a cheap owner and questionable cooks they must not get tipped very well and that's a shame"}
{"text":"I like the french fries which they serve with the Wings. I ordered Buffalo wings and they were kind of dry with hardly any sauce on them. If you like to have some sauce on your wings request it at the time of the order. Also the wings I got were dry,burnt and tasted stale. Additionally  if you want more dip sauce you will have to pay additional for it. Although the hostess provided it as complimentary to us.Overall not a good experience. Not going back again."}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday night. The wings were soggy. I prefer the crispy wings at All Stars, but my boyfriend loves this restaurant, so I guess it's a preference difference between soggy and crispy wings? Fries were pretty good though."}
{"text":"I was craving something saucy so my wife and I decided to go to St. Louis at the Fairview Mall. We have been to St. Louis before and really enjoyed it. The waitress was polite. The service was a bit slow. When she was coming out with our order she realized that she made a mistake with mine. I ordered a rib and wing combo with boneless bites. She brought it with regular chicken wings. She took the platter back and brought back the ribs and said the bites will be 7 minutes. The ribs were horrible. Barely any sauce. Finally the bites came out and they were even worse. Very dry. Almost no sauce. Like I said, I was craving something saucy so I was quite disappointed. Needless to say, I won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"Good local hangout
good pulled pork sandwich"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. Also they have truely cold beer with 2 subzero beer taps."}
{"text":"I'm often in the Annex neighbourhood for a variety of reasons, and when I'm hungry but not in the mood for discounted sushi, the Annex St. Louis is my go-to location. 
Here is what you need to know about this restaurant:
1) The place is always clean.
2) There is a nice hidden patio at the back.
3) Lots of HD sports going all the time.
4) Excellent and friendly service. Consistently.
5) Food is served hot, and timely. The Wings are good and the dill sauce is awesome. Be sure to check out the daily/monthly promos too. **They do serve deep fried pickles.
6) Good variety of taps, and super cold cans of beer.
7) Great location, and free parking on side streets.
8) Warm and welcoming atmosphere for meeting up with friends or family. Not dark and dingy.
My only issue with this restaurant is the size. It is small compared to other restaurants...but maybe that's what makes this location more \"inviting\" than other oversized, loud, and cold pubs.
When it comes to wing joints, this place definitely competes for the top spot with other local favourites.
Enjoy! ( Wing Sauce of Choice: Hot and Honey, but if you want the heat... go Honey and Suicide)"}
{"text":"I used to go to St Louis all the time for wings....they are good with no doubt. But recently I found out the MSG effects me a lot afterwards  (super thirsty even at late night after drinking tons of water ). So sorry st Louis. ...hope you can figure out a way to put no MSG on your wings...."}
{"text":"Wings done right. We always come here for the wing deal on Tuesday. Wings are good and well priced. Just off the highway great place for dinner and avoid congestion on highway"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at a restaurant- hands down. Took us 20 mins to get waters and we asked three different servers (including the bar tender). Ordered a wrap without tomatoes, and it came with tomatoes. Didn't even get enough silverware for my party of three. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. The wings are big and juicy. The people at the bar are a bunch of jokers, if you end up coming here two or more times you end up being friends with everyone."}
{"text":"\"Uh waitress can I get a...\"

a) fork
b) knife
c) spoon
d) my appetizers to arrive before the main order
e) pitcher of beer
f) dessert

or 

g) all of the above?

If you guessed g) then you would be right.  (The fact that I had to get down to g) should show you the type of place this is...)  A group of us from the office went to lunch (8 of us) and the waitress just couldn't seem to get anything right.  

We were pleasant, waited patiently for everything, even ate our order of wings anticipating that our appetizers were going to be coming soon!   After about 5 minutes after finishing our wings we reminded our waitress about our appetizers...which were then brought out 10 minutes after that.  I guess when they couldn't get a drink order correct we should have just stopped there.  

Now onto their \"food\".  (Note the quotes as I wouldn't make anyone eat here again...ever.)  

The nachos.  Ugh.  I don't know about you but I consider the use of that nacho cheese \"sauce\" to be disgusting and never to be used.  The nachos were obviously put together with little thought and was doused with the cheese sauce with some shredded cheese on top to cover it.  (Think of the shredded cheese as a \"toupee\" for the garbage that it is hiding underneath it.)  

The wings are average, (the hot and honey is actually a really good combination of spicy and sweet) but its their dill dipping sauce that make them a bit more palatable.  Or in this case, less-average.  

I know there isn't a lot of food choice out in this area, but should you decide to go out, that's fine, just don't go here."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this St. Louis Bar & Grill. Unlike many other ones, this St. Louis is in a very nice location. It is right beside the Roger Centre where the Toronto Blue Jays play. It is also a very nice, clean and peaceful neighborhood near the lake shore.
         I came here for for the Tuesday specials which was half price wings. Like all ways the wings were delicious and perfectly cooked.
The waiters/ waitresses were very nice and respectful; everyone knows in order to get the half price deal you have to order the wings with a large drink. Though my friend did not know and just asked for water, the waitress said it was okay and to not worry about it. Then she gave her the half price wings deal WITHOUT the charge of the drink. 1lbs is usually around $10, but the waitress cut it down to $7.50 or so.

I have read many other reviews and I see many people were upset and gave low ratings for this locations, but I personally enjoy this location much more than the others. Plus the location it is set in persuaded me to give the rating of 4 stars."}
{"text":"I am not doing very well in choosing restaurants these days, but I gave this one a whole two stars.

It was busy when I went there, maybe because there was a hockey game on their TVs, though nobody seemed to being watching it.  A sports bar it isn't.

I had the pulled pork sandwich.  It was ok but a bit skimpy on the meat, strangely flavourless and kind of dry.  The onion rings ON the sandwich I do not agree with, though they were good when I painstakingly got them out of the sandwich and ate them separately.

The fries there was no chance of me liking, since they were, as in most restaurants, frozen.  If any restaurant would only give me real fries (is that so difficult?), I would go there every day and twice on Sundays.

The beer was fine.

As for service,  I would have liked the server to mention the specials, which I did not notice until after I ordered.  Then, I lost count of the times the server or manager (?) interrupted my dinner to ask me \"Is everything okay?\"  Once was more than enough.  I left about half my meal just to get away from them.

The washroom could use some cleaning, and the locks on the stall doors repaired.

This place is fairly new so maybe I will try it again when they get over their anxiety about whether everything is okay."}
{"text":"Quality downhill...went a few weeks ago on half price night. Service was
terrible and the wings tasted like they were left in the fryer too long. Looks like I'm done with St Louis"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was overall ok, lots of young people, but apart from that, the service was bad, and the food took way too long, if your whole table wants to complain to the waitress then it's been too long"}
{"text":"Owners are super friendly at this location. They have a kids menu with 6 options, my son had their famous wings and finished them all. I had the angus burger which came out fresh and tasty. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Honestly so amazing! Amanda is hands down the best server I've ever had! She is so friendly and kind and would do anything to please you! Top notch!"}
{"text":"This particular ST Louis is a great spot to come and watch a football or hockey game.  They have TV's all over the place and usually have all sporting events on one of the TV's.  The Cobb salad was spectacular, my girlfriend and I tried it the other day and of course the wings are very good.  I especially like the Jerk wings.

We also found the bartender to be very attentive and by that I mean if my glass was approaching the empty point she always asked if we wanted another."}
{"text":"i went here with my friend to watch UFC. They have a nice TV set up upstairs with a projector. The room upstairs has an intimate feel and it i didn't get too busy. The service was decent and the food was not bad. I expected better but it was still good and inexpensive. I'd come back again for UFC events but most likely not on any other day."}
{"text":"First of all, the wings were incredibly average. Nothing special. Also, the service was terrible. Every worker was rude. Our server rolled her eyes at us after every order and after everytime we asked for anything. I would definitely think twice abut going here."}
{"text":"One star for the nice server who called us a cab and brought us waters when the bartender rudely informed our party of 6 that she was closing soon and didn't welcome us for a drink. Business is business, don't be rude."}
{"text":"The wings here are to die for. The only flavor I recommend is \"hot\".  You can really taste the dry cryspy marinade that this chain uses as their specialty.  They have half price wings on Tuesdays with the purchase of a beverage (can be alcoholic or non-alcoholic).  They also have other specials throughout the week - you can see their specials on their menu online.

The other thing I love about this place, other than the million tv screens playing the latest sporting event, is their dill dipping sauce. I dip the fries into this sauce.  It is to die for.  

I don't have much to add for this place aside from the above.  Order the wings - 1 lbs or 2 lbs and dip the fries in the dill cream sauce. Enough said.  Regular price for 1 lb wings is $10.99 and 2 lb wings is $19.99.  

I had dragged yet another date there. I wanted to order the 2lb wings but felt inappropriate as my date felt that 1lb would suffice for him. At the end of the date, I was still hungry so I had to ask \"if he was gonna eat the last of his fries\".

I usually order the grapefruit juice which is $3 approx. which is reasonable."}
{"text":"I love the chicken and waffles ! Order it as is ! I am super picky and the sauces sound weird but its perfect! The sweetness in the Belgian waffles ... the crispy fried chicken..... slightly spicy Sriracha and the mild dill sauce ( does not taste pickely) ...so good. And not to mention,served with sweet potato fries ;) . Service is usually pretty good at this location."}
{"text":"Came here for the Jays game on a weekday... Place was packed, they didn't have much seating left, but I ordered 2lbs of BBQ Spicy wings... Wow these are by far one of the best wings I've ever had! Crunchy, sauces just right, and not too much or too little meat! Their ratio of crunch to meat was just right, and the potato wedges were actually really good! Dipping sauce was served in one of those take-away packets which is pretty stingy but it was actually really good. 

No celery or carrot sticks though. Price was about $27 for 2lbs, so on the high side."}
{"text":"Went in about 8 pm not busy at all, we ordered the nachos with chilli and Two pounds of wings. Our nachos arrived with no chilli and very little cheese, we asked what happened and were told that they ran out of chilli. We had to ask that they place some cheese on the nachos, they returned with not much more. The wings then arrived and the fries were cold and tasteless. The barkeep was our server and continued to apologize, for the errors. There was another family of four seated quite close and the husband was still waiting for his food while the rest of the family had nearly completed their meal. We have had better service in the past and this evening, we were not impressed. We have been to other locations and the service along with the food was head over heels compared to this evening service. Never again , All Stars opening soon, I can see why and they will take a good percentage of their business away."}
{"text":"This was my first time at any St. Louis Bar and Grill. I wasn't sure what to order, so I asked Jess (Jessica B) the server to make my choice, and she recommended 3 items. I asked her which of those 3 she was going to give me, and she said it would be a surprise. 

She delivered a Buffalo Chicken Caesar Wrap, and it was absolutely delicious! An excellent choice, and it may even pull me away from my regular chicken caesar wrap place. 

Service was fast and friendly even as the restaurant started to fill up. Jess was good on the upsell as well. My only concern is that the alcohol prices didn't seem to be on the menu -- just the statement to ask the server for prices. Weird, but that didn't stop us from taking Jess' recommendation for featured beer that was on sale. All in all, a great impression."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. It was an extreme cold alert today and their heat wasn't working and they had the back doors open for a shipment, we wore out winter jackets the whole time we were there. We had to get the waitress over to take our order, even though there was only two other customers there. My triple decker sandwich was made with bread that was very similar to wonder bread. Smelled weird. There was a strange wire type thing in my sisters order of wings. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Service is awesome and Cally the bartender makes the best yager bombs."}
{"text":"Terrible location! Servers are rude and not helpful at all. The hostess was extremely rude and yelled at the customers. Overall terrible experience and I don't recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"My father and I have been coming here for over 5 years to watch the Leafs games over some cold beet and delicious wings. This is by far my favorite spot in Toronto and I've been to Duffs, All Stars,  Wild Wings, Real Sports, etc etc. Nothing beats oven baked wings, hot fries, and *excellent* service every time. Not to mention a cozy, but energetic atmosphere to watch your favorite sports team! Well done."}
{"text":"We were delivered old, dry, and burnt food.   Absolutely disgusting, word of advice, never ever order from this location!!"}
{"text":"Great wings! Excellent service shout out to Melissa the absolutely best, friendly, and courteous waitress."}
{"text":"Greasy cold and old looking food. Nothing for vegetarians. Service was ok. The beer was usual."}
{"text":"Lots of specials and they love their football. If you are looking for a great place to watch some NFL on a Sunday or HNIC the buzz couldn't be better. The owner is a huge Patriots fan and has great hiring practices. If you are looking for a good sports bar, with good food and won't leave wondering what happened to your wallet after a few ice cold pints. This is your spot."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner during Anime North weekend. Overall, their service was beyond horrible and the food was mediocre. I'm assuming that this restaurant doesn't usually get so many customers at once because it seemed like they were short on staff. We got seated by one girl but noone came to take our orders for 20 minutes. We raised our hands multiple times and every waitress that walked by looked at us but refused to say a single word to us. The least they could have done was to tell us that they were busy and that someone would get to us eventually. We had to physically approach two waitresses that were standing around a table chatting for them to take our order. 

It then took 30 minutes until our food came. The wings were hard, the ribs were small and not tender. The only thing I actually liked was the dill dip. I ordered a 3 course meal...they didn't give me my appetizer or dessert. 

I will never come back to this location. Every waitress we saw gave us dirty looks or ignored us completely. The food is not worth it."}
{"text":"Their famous wings are average IMO. I'm no wing expert, but I know the difference between good wings and meh wings. They are still pretty tasty, it's just that they are not outstanding. But it is a good to have a bar in the neighbourhood where I can go with friends to have good time without having to travel far. Service is good as servers are friendly and foods come out quick."}
{"text":"the food is simple and awesome! I only ordered wrings, fries and a coke. just what the doctor ordered. Its a bit weird cuz theres two different menu for game days and they sometimes get packed. I stil get asked for my ID but I guess that secuity girls just doing her job. great place for a bite after the game!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly atmosphere, nice spot to just layback and have a good time with friends or just pop in for a beer and wings. Also a place to enjoy the game..."}
{"text":"This place is a typical chain bar for beer, wings, ribs and other grub, although it makes an effort to be more than that.

The food is fairly predictable, but it's not terrible. I tend to stick with the wings when I go here to have a few drinks with friends and watch whatever game is on TV.

In addition to beer and wings, it's got the other necessary elements of a sports bar: cute waitresses and plenty of big-screen TVs.

If the game on TV is a washout (see: Maple Leafs) at least you can find entertainment in drunken buffoons striking out with the servers."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst restaurant on the Danforth.  We had a great server, but the manager is ridiculous.  The food is so bad it's inedible.  The chicken was frozen with fake grill marks.  My kid ate about 2 bites of her fake boneless chicken wings, and threw up half an hour later.  I had some sort of weird club house sandwich that had processed cheddar cheese (?), more of the fake chicken - that was raw, greasy bacon and massive big globs of mayo.  Disgusting.  When we complained to the manager about my daughters food (not only did it not taste good, it looked a bit off color), he just shrugged. Bizarre. Never again."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service.... terribly understaffed for a busy Sunday afternoon on their patio! The food is nothing to write home about. Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"I've been to the St. Louis around Yonge & Eglinton quite a few times and have always loved their wings, so I figured these would be the same.  Sadly, they were pretty disappointing.  It was completely dead in the place but our wings still took over half an hour to come out.  I had the hot & honey (honey & hot?) and it tasted like the two flavours were drowning each other out.  The wings were chewy and overall not as good as I expected, but the fries and dill sauce were pretty awesome.  The service was also very good.

Service = 4 stars
Wings = 2 stars"}
{"text":"I've gone a few times but always on Tuesday for the half price wings.

Service and wings have always been amazing.  Pop is flat and overpriced but not surprising for a bar.

I've always managed to get there for the last table and when I leave there's always a crowded front door with people waiting to get in.

If you can't find parking in the outdoor lot, head downstairs for the underground parking."}
{"text":"Go to any other location other than this. It took them 15 minutes to take our orders. We then waiting over an hour for our food and when we got it all the orders were either wrong or ice cold... the wait staff is stressed and flustered however they chat amongst themselves which wastes even more time, just so brutal, never go"}
{"text":"I came here and was blown away by how small and tight this place is!! Honestly the size of a classroom.

We came, they gave us a table, whatever. There were 3 waiters, no one seemed to ask if we wanted anything. Eventually they brought up drinks. 

Anyways our food came, my boyfriends fries were COLD. And I got my sandwich/soup/salad trio with fries. They actually forgot the fries and i had to ask for them. Mine were hot and fresh, the waitress told me to be careful cause they were fresh....I thought it was obvious that ALL foods had to be fresh.

Did i mention that when our food came, we had NO utensils? We had to ask for our forks, napkins etc.

Anyways i didn't like the french onion soup, they were nice enough to let me have their potato bacon soup. That was really good. Fries were good, sandwich was alright.

Greek salad was kinda gross!!! Not fresh!

They didn't really come back to check up on us, asked if we wanted more to drink.

The service is alright... 3/5
Food 3/5 (average, minus the cold fries)
Decor/space 2/5

I wouldn't come back though, i'd spend a little more for something better or go to the food court (much fresher than what we had there)"}
{"text":"Went here for the Wingsanity special with some friends on a Saturday night (UFC fight night). Surprisingly didn't have to wait for a table. The wings were decent (nothing special) as I tried all the dry rub flavours (Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Salt and Pepper, and Frank's Red Hot). The first batch (I had five batches) was a pound of half of Cajun wings with a side of fries. The Cajun was the best flavour of the four I tried but the occasional burnt wing was a definite let down. I was impressed that the waitress never showed any frustration with my constant ordering (all you can eat wings for 19.99) as I ordered five times. Overall, decent wings, good service, and beer...........can't ask for too much. Would've given a 3.5 but no half stars available."}
{"text":"What a garbage place!!! Over priced BS dried up wings with garbage waiters who disappear for hours on end!! 

And when I asked for my waiter she came back late, yells at me so I told her off! Stupid morons you don't talk to customers like that, and offer ppl garbage service. 
My 2nd order never came in, I asked every waiter like 5 times for one basket of wings. and they told me that the kitchen is closed now (after 45 minutes) because it toke so long to get my order, st Louis used to be very good!

But now a days they hire Morons who just wana run home, I'm sitting and eating at 12:30pm they already putting chairs up and rushing to go home!! 

Oh man I don't say everything I noticed, but this bar is garbage I went to 3 different locations too.
Never again! fk St. Louis bar!!"}
{"text":"Im obsessed with their dipping sauce! 
Overall I have had positive experience at this location. 
Nice wings & decent cocktails. 
Their salads are good too - large portion very filling."}
{"text":"This place (the original location - from before the old man turned the business over to the kid) just keep going downhill. Used to have the best wings in TO (IMO) and now they're a greasy, barely cooked, boney mess. And as bad as the food is, the service is worse. If their philosophy is \"hire attitude, train skill\" they forgot the second part. And I guess they didn't realize that \"attitude\" should mean positive, not superior.  Only thing that keeps this place in business is that it's the only roadhouse with a patio within a mile in any direction."}
{"text":"So first of all, the atmosphere sucks, we thought we were sitting in a library.  

Second, the Mac and chili burger is the worst thing I've ever eaten.  Everyone at our table who ordered it had to eat it with a fork and knife.  After eating that monstrosity of a burger, we were subjected to the worst indigestion/heartburn/acid reflux of our lives.

So to summarize don't eat here, spend your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went here to watch FIFA with my friends. We came 15 minutes early and got the nice seats in front of their widescreen t.v. So we're sitting there with our beers waiting for the game to start and then out of nowhere their fat scummy manager shows up and tries to start beef with us. He starts accusing us of trying to scam the place by not buying any food and saying things like \"you think you can just buy a beer and get the front row seat?\". What a total lack of professionalism here. The only reason we didnt report him to corporate was because the waitress was our friend and we didnt want her to get in trouble. Obviously we bought food, which we would have ordered anyway once the game started, but with that kind of middle management, I cannot recommend this place in good faith. The food was okay but with that kind of attitude, who knows what corners are being cut behind the scenes."}
{"text":"This place hasn't been Argentinian owned for at least 2 years now. The original owners sold and moved on.  Doesn't matter as it is now closed and about to become yet another St. Louis Bar and Grill"}
{"text":"Yeah it wasn't that good.
Went for the all you can eat wings. Took 30 minutes for out first order to come. They won't let us order the next batch until we're done with the wings we currently have. So there's a good 15-20 minute wait between.
Also, the wings weren't that good. Over cooked and not seasoned properly. They didn't even coat the wings in the sauce properly. So I have overcooked wings that are partially coated and some that are drowning in sauce. The wings are worse than Hooters. At least at Hooters, you're staring at Hooters.

Only thing that was half way close to coming decent was the prepackaged dipping sauce which they only give you one small packet."}
{"text":"God fucking dammit these guys need to get their sound issues sorted out for these ufc fight events upstairs in the lounge area. Very frustrating having to watch live right events with no sound half the time 

:((("}
{"text":"ugh, I hate this place, Ive been here a couple times with friends and I find that the service is no good, the staff is unfriendly and the food is way too fried my fries and chicken strips are always too dry, the only thing that's alright is the nachos."}
{"text":"I don't know how this is still open - we were excited a St Louis was opening in the beach. It has to be the worst food we've ever had. The fries were never fully cooked, I think a batch was still a potato? The wings are as small as your pinky with hardly ever meat. 

You can tell the wait staff doesn't listen, or they just don't care, because our food orders have been wrong every time (and we only gave this place 3 chances). And they still can't seem to grasp what \"sauce on side\" means."}
{"text":"Food: 4/5.     Service: 1/5.                       I've been here numerous times and the wings and fries are always great. I haven't really tried other menu items besides the beer (which is obviously delish) so that's all I can comment on. My issue with this location was when my husband and I went there on Canada Day for lunch and there were only 2 other people there. We were never acknowledged or brought menus. The waitress clearly saw us and just when we thought she was coming over to us, she picked up the remote control and started slowly walking around changing all the channels on the T.Vs. After 10 minutes we got up and walked out but it took every ounce of my being not to say something (or grab that remote and chuck it across the bar) I chose the higher path on this day. We went to the one in Aurora and the service was way better, that's to say, we actually were served. Besides that, one of the waitresses there now wears her skirt so short you can see her bum...and it's not a nice bum."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, great food. Ordered wings, tasted great. Waitresses are awesome helpful. Although this location is a little small but is busy for a reason!"}
{"text":"I know this place is a chain but the wings are terrible and so I'm always so surprised how they remained to be in business for this long. The wings are generally too dry and overcooked. The flavour wings are bland.. particularly the hot wings - it lacks that Frank hot sauce vinegary tang that a hot sauce needs."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 20 people for a birthday party for 8:30 booked in advance. We got there at 8:30 to find they gave our table away because they \"had a line.\" What a joke. If you take a reservation,  honor it. What an excuse for management. We ended up being accommodated at Fox and the Fiddle up the street and we're happy to give them our business."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group of friends on a Monday night so the restaurant probably didn't expect it to be that busy... but we encountered a few issues. We waited an hour for our food and some of my friends were short some wings which they received later. I think the management could have done more to support the new waiter and the single cook that night. The most inexcusable part was that my margarita was extremely salty. I didn't want to hassle the staff since it was busy, so I didnt say anything... but it is supposed to be a bar and grill so they should be able to make a margarita that doesn't taste like the ocean."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon.  World cup soccer.  Packed bar.  And... one bartender/waiter.

Four of us sat down and waited for some menus.. and waited.. and waited... and waited... and.. yep, you guessed it.. waited.  20+ minutes went by, and we don't even have menus yet.

The couple sitting across from us, looked very angry as they motioned for attention but was constantly ignored.

Get some staffing to run your business right, fools."}
{"text":"I really love their wings here. It comes with a side of steak fries which i love. They also give you their version of ranch sauce which includes garlic so it's more flavorful. I've come here a few times and always order their wings. Can't attest to anything other than that but if that's your thing, I don't think you will be disappointed. The service here is a hit or miss. They also don't serve food late at night and only serve alcohol until closing."}
{"text":"Went first month they opened.
Bad service
No ambience
Awful food
Hope they get better"}
{"text":"First the good news, wings are ok.  Now the bad. Don't ever order anything but the wings, it'll be bad. Example: onion rings turned out to be cut-up onion pieces deep fried; nachos come with CheezWhiz instead of real cheese.  Yuk!"}
{"text":"I love their chicken wings. Place is always busy spacialy if ther is a hockey game going. Nice service, clean place and delicious wings..."}
{"text":"You can't expect too much out of a bar franchise.

Let me just say this, I have been going here with my colleagues for the last year and a half. It's a quick and cheap option that allows us to watch the game while getting a beer or two.

The food is mediocre and the girls at the front are super helpful. The service however is a whole different story.

There is a server there, her name is Helen. She dresses like a slob, she is super unprofessional and extremely rude. I grew up in the restaurant industry and i've worked every station, from busy boy to kitchen manager. This server is the reason why we and many more will never go back. She is absolutely repulsive and I can't believe the owner would allow a single person to bring down their business like that. I am not alone in my thoughts! Even her co-workers agree. 

I do not come onto yelp to complain about servers, I have better things to do. I have had bad service many times, and i've never resorted to coming onto yelp.

But her service was disgusting, she had attitude to begin with and completely forgot about us. We walked out after 15 mins of waiting for our water, and as I was passing by her I explained to her that she was killing this business, her response was a \"I don't give a F\" look\"

If you are miserable, unprofessional, and don't take care of yourself, you shouldn't be working in the service industry. I think a call center would be more of a fit. Anyways, nothing bad to say about the food, nor the staff, just specifically that waitress."}
{"text":"Good place for drinks but the food isn't great. I ordered a triple deck chicken club and the chicken was gross"}
{"text":"Great wings good service good value for ones money. My favourite wing place in Vaughan"}
{"text":"My fave St. Louis location! 

I especially love this location cos it seems to have better wings than other locations and I like its ambiance way better too. The male waiters during the afternoons are very casual and non pretentious, making the atmosphere very comfortable. My bf is in love with their fries and dip and so do I (he secretly wants to buy boxes of the dip home)! My two complaints are that for the Tuesday wing deal you are obliged to buy a drink and other than wings and fries, I am not impressed by their other dishes. But overall, best wing place in town!"}
{"text":"Came there and waited for someone to seat us...but server came and a couple of them walking around saw us two waiting but did not even approach or even say please wait and someone will be there...got annoyed and and just went and sat ourselves at the nearest available table just so that we don't stared at as if we were aliens.  Anyway, once sat there...and again no one approached us  for with menus for another while...but when I looked around - the servers weren't even busy...they were just practically taking their time walking around the tables and not like they were walking any faster either...I SAY IT WAS TERRIBLE SERVICE.  Not only was the waiting long BUT once ordered our wings - they were burnt and PUNY and small...felt like it was a RIP OFF....major rip offffffffffffff and the 1bl wings do cost you easily $14 not including tax....there were fries BUT fries are not worth anything since they were just potatoes...YUP, NOT GOING BACK FOR SURE !   Still tipped our waiter a very good tip since she was pregnant and nice...but still not coming back at all !"}
{"text":"always have to wait so long on Tuesday nights. Got meatball sandwich one time and it tasted awful! Spent about $12 and only took a few bites! Would only go back for wings on Tuesdays if the wait time is not so long."}
{"text":"This location is terrible! I love st. Louis wings but the service here sucks! We come for lunch every two weeks and it's the same story every time ... One server who swings by the table once throughout our meal. Today I ordered hot wings and definitely got medium dry. On top of it I was told that I had to order a drink in order to get the lunch special wings and fries. So I ask what soft drinks they have and the server says none at the moment because their taps are down. But still gives me a hard time about forcing me to order a drink in order to get the special when she didn't have any soft drinks. We come for the wings only and don't expect anything when it comes to service at all."}
{"text":"Small bar just outside the Skydome.  They had bouncers at the door during the event in the Roger's Centre that only allowed a few people in at a time.  Atmosphere was nice, TVs were on CP 24, hockey and curling. Waitress was nice, but that's about all the positive's I can think about.

Despite being a small bar, you'd think the restaurant would be better prepared when there are events in the Roger's Centre.  It took about an hour to be seated which was not their fault since it was very packed.  Our group had to be split in two and the food took about 45 minutes to arrive.

I ordered the wings which were very over-cooked and cold by the time it got to me.  I sent the food back and they brought it back to me less than 5 minutes later (not even re-warmed) with some sauce on it.

I did not touch the wings and just asked them to forget it. I'd share with my husband.  The waitress returns to tell me that the manager has said since there was an event at the Roger's Centre, they will not take the wings off my bill. The waitress, however, suggested that we ask for the owner. It was ridiculous and unacceptable so we said to ask the owner and if they had a problem, they can come speak directly to us.

The waitress returned to let us know that the owner said \"of course\" they would take the wings off my bill. 

I had also forgotten my sunglasses in the bar and the waitress ran after me to give them back.

Overall, the waitress did very well, however, I was very disappointed by management of the restaurant and the quality of food.  I would not return to St. Louis Bar & Grill."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I didn't even get a chance to eat here...

After walking in at around 9pm on a weeknight, we waited 10 minutes before we were even greeted by a waitress. When she finally approached us, she said a huge crowd just came in, so the wait would be very very long. I pointed out a table for two that was open in the corner of the restaurant and she begrudgingly said we could sit there and that she would be by in a few minutes to wipe the table down.
After another 20 minutes of waiting patiently, the manager came to our table to tell us to move seats so another customer could squeeze into the already tight space. She made no comments or efforts regarding our filthy table, or the fact that we didn't even have a menu.

At that point, we decided to leave the restaurant and take our business elsewhere. 
We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I like that this location has a second floor with a different vibe. As the title suggests, it feels a bit more lounge-y. St.Louis has the yummiest fries, so crispy and tasty, perfect when paired with their signature dill dip. Their wings are definitely no All Stars wings but it's not terrible either ($9.99 for 1lb). Their hot wings however, are not very hot at all. Word of advice: go on TUESDAY NIGHTS for 1/2 price wings!

Their Klondike chili is decent ($7.49 with fries, $5.49 without), their cocktails are good, and I love their nachos with jalapenos, it's really spicy and perfect for sharing while watching the game on their many tv screens ($11.99)"}
{"text":"This particular location is pretty small and the crowd is definitely much older, but I like it because it makes you feel like your in some small town diner or something. Everyone is so jolly and old, it's a very different vibe from the locations downtown and at North York.

Food is the same as any other St. Louis location, it's a chain. Just stay away from the overpriced salads and you're good to go."}
{"text":"- preparation for take out was awful- no napkins, no cutlery
- French fries were soggy, crushed under wings

Won't return"}
{"text":"Ahhhhh st.louis wings. I came here for the first time during the under 17 fifa world cup in toronto a couple years back. I wanted some where cheap to get a drink, eat some ribs and wings and watch the game. This place hits on all fronts. You have your standard wings and ribs, with all the best sidesfries, rings and coleslaw. But half a rack of ribs for less than 10 bucks is awesome. If it wasnt going to clog my arteries , i would love to eat here every day. Hey everyone has one guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"We went to St Louis Bar and Grill for lunch. There was a rush from 12 - 1 and then it was pretty quiet. They have TVs everywhere). We ordered two An gus burgers ( $5 each) and a pound of wings ( $11). It was a Wednesday and that was their special.  When the food came we realize that both came with fries. I had the burger, no extra toppings ( cheese, bacon $1.29 each). It was very good and very neat, no grease.  The wings were very smokey and salty.  I had to dip them in sauce because it was so smokey.

TL:DR All in all, 3/5. I liked the burgers and fries a lot but the 1 lbs wings and fries were not worth $11."}

{"text":"This is my go to bar for sports and a good time. The servers and bar tenders take the time to get to know your name. When I come in they already have a beer waiting for me with a smile on their faces. The owners and managers are always on the floor having a good time with you. Definitely a 'cheers'  atmosphere. There are quite a few TV's and they're sure to have whatever sport you're into on a couple screens. The music is pretty good and the food is great. Best wing flavours in Toronto and best appetizers around."}
{"text":"Foods ok, atmosphere's nice, but service is terrible waitresses are more concerned about txting their friends and hanging out at employee table than refilling your water."}
{"text":"Had it not been for our waitress, I would have given this place 2 stars. 

This is my first time at this location and it's considerably smaller looking than the one at bay street though I'm sure they're comparable. There's an outdoor patio and most of the seating is made up of high bar stools and tables. My cousins, brother and I walked in not knowing whether to wait to be seated or to seat ourselves. It's not particularly busy but no one welcomed us or even seemed to acknowledge our presence. We ended up settling down at the back of the restaurant in a booth next to the kitchen still with no acknowledgement from passing servers that made eye contact with us. Moments later, menus were handed to my brother without a word and we just sat there and reviewed them I guess? Our server in particular who was also making drinks definitely made our dining experience better because of her positive attitude and charm. 3 of us ordered the Friday special which was a half pound of wings, half rack of ribs, fries and coleslaw ($19.99) with the purchase of a large beverage ($2.99/pop). My other cousin ordered a burger with sweet potato fries but the order got messed up and she ended up getting regular fries instead. Our server noticed and gave them to her on the house which I thought was a very attentive gesture. The food is pretty average and typically what you would expect from a bar. Ribs were very tender and could easily be cut with a fork, if you like them that way. Wings are standard and the coleslaw was lightly dressed which I surprisingly really enjoyed.

Overall, this location really doesn't stand out to me food, people or atmosphere wise. But if you're in the neighbourhood looking for some discounted food or drinks, be sure to check out their daily specials.

PS- no liquid or foam soap in the women's restroom, please refill."}
{"text":"Arrived here on a Tuesday with my cousin around 5pm. I was expecting the place to be packed (or so I'm familiar with other locations) but it had a nice crowd and we didn't have to wait for a table.

They had an open patio but we decided on seats inside with a/c. Our server was very genuine and welcoming which ultimately made our dining experience that much better. 

We each ordered 2lbs of their original wings which came with a side of fries and dill sauce. The wait on the food was about 15 mins which wasn't noticeably long. The fries were fresh, hot, crispy and fluffy - paired perfectly with the dill! 

One thing I did notice about the sauce on the wings was that there was an excessive amount leftover which just pooled at the bottom of our bowls. This could be a good/bad thing depending on how you like your wings. 

The wings were on the smaller side but at the end of our meal, we were stuffed! Especially not having eaten anything prior, we didn't feel cheated on.

Overall, I had a pleasant experience here and I would come back."}
{"text":"This location should win an award for the worst service in the city. I've never had issues with the waitresses but the hostess and manager have no respect for customers. Happened to me more than once. I had to give it a review."}

the service sucks, and the staff and \"management\"  are rude!
it took the waitress 15 minutes to come and check on us. when we asked for a drink, she just never came back so we had to make our way to the bar ourselves.

We complained about the service to the \"manager\", a weird looking guy came .  He was very unproffessional in my opinion.  He didnt even apologize, let alone offer something for the inconvinience. 

this place is officially banned on my list.
 
im suprized they are still in business!!!"}
{"text":"St. Louis wings...how you've failed. 
One of these just opened on the beach so one night after dinner failed to defrost I went here with my family. None of us had ever been to any St. Louis Wings so we figured why not? What a bad choice. 
We got there and realized how SMALL this location was, we were stuck in between the two doors i.e. the one from the outside and the inside door, they informed us a table would be open soon, so we waited about 5 minutes. Not bad, I've waited just as long for the Green Eggplant down the street. 
Once we were seated we ordered appetizers and our entrees. We ordered the \"onion chips\" and the asian nachos. Let me tell you what a stinking RIP OFF. You get a handful of chips where are basically just onion rings cut into pieces, but the real disappointment or should I even say outrage was the asian nachos, you literally get 3 chips with peppers and a little bit of chicken on top. 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Regular nacho chips, for $6.49!!!!!!!! I'm still pissed a week later. 
Our entrees came. I had the pulled pork which was DRYYYY, and was supposed to be topped with caramalized onions and mushrooms which I didn't even know were there. The bun was burnt. 
My boyfriend had the half rack of rib special which he said was a good portion except for the fact that his potatoes were cold. My mom didn't even comment on her \"jerk\" wings. The fries sucked, had some red I assume supposed to be some sort of seasoning but who would have known. My sister got ice cream with her meal which was about 2 teaspoons of ice cream, how cheap can you get? 
On another note the layout as mentioned before was absurd, the waitress serving drinks was getting squished between the high top chairs when people didn't see her coming and moved their seats. 
I did email the franchiser to tell her about the poor service, but she was not of much help either. She indicated that there was a picture of the asian nachos on the menu - but realistically the pictures often shown on menus are not always what you get - I did NOT expect THREE nachos. The onion chips she said were not supposed to be a main but an appetizer, this I understand but a handful for the $5.99 price tag is lunacy. She stated my pulled pork couldn't be dry because it is mixed with BBQ sauce - well you could have fooled me!! She kind of vindictively stated that she only bought a franchise because everybody loves their food - I clearly must be the only exception??? Finally once I noted that servers being squished by chairs was a health and safety issues, she stated that the layout is tight but seems to work for them. Ask the server that got getting skewered how she felt about it, I highly doubt she'd say it \"works\". 
Overall, I was disappointed for a 90 dollar bill, my mom was crying a little on the inside I'd say. She is a very tolerable woman and she was the one who prompted me to contact them about feedback. The fact that the franchiser was condecending and naive to her franchises' flaws just further irritated me and I will avoid this place at all costs and spread the word."}
{"text":"how can you go wrong with some beer and wings?! i like it a lot, definitely the best place for wings and the waiters and waitresses are all so nice. since it's like a really big place, it's good to go there and chill with friends. when i went, there weren't a lot of people so we can still talk, watch tv and eat at our comfort."}
{"text":"For a quick lunch here ordering 1 lb of wings in salt and pepper.  It tastes good but there is only 6 to 7 small wings in the basket.  Without the fries, I would have to order another pound.  It's not cheap with a beer total bill $25"}
{"text":"Food is fine, exactly what you'd expect from any of the other locations. 

Service is terrible. Every single time. This is in my neighbourhood so I'm desperately hoping service improves each time I come in here, but it never does. No acknowledgment at the door, slow service (even right at the bar where service is typically faster), and overall unfriendly and uninterested servers."}
{"text":"Came here for a round of drinks with some friends. Their special for rolling rock was pretty decent at 5 bucks a pint so not complaining (Friday night) much better than the $17 pitcher we had gotten a half hour earlier at the Frog and Firkin. My GF picked up the wings with the suicide sauce, which she had tackled before without incident. I guess St. Louis decided to up their game as her wings came out to be on the sweat inducing water/beer guzzling side! That being said she tanked through the rest of it and all in all it made for a very relaxed get together. 

Nothing else about this St. Louis really stood out. Of course it came with the standard group of drunk guys in the midst of being cut off...

Solid 3 star"}
{"text":"I have tried wings here more than any other food in my life. The wings on Tuesdays are half price, and on a side note, the wings are so thin the chickens could possibly have been fashion models. They are nice people, but don't expect good service on Tuesdays, and specially in the summer, prepare for a 45 minute line up."}
{"text":"Dining room is dark and dingy.   So we settled for the patio with the jumbo jets rumbling by every 5minutes or so.  

The wings were average at best.  They were out of Corona beer.  My friend ordered mike's hard lemonade, they were out of that.  Then he ordered Smirnoff, they were out of that as well.   Nonetheless, we ordered the draft beer that was on sale...since they were out of everything we liked to drink.  

The wings were average quality, and the beer...well it's typical draft.  

Our waitress, Tamara was very pleasant and professional.  

The washrooms had no soap and no sanitizer...really!?  C'mon this is a wing place, how the hell you supposed to wash your hands. 

The service was overall good. The atmosphere below par.  I probably wouldn't come here again.  Just bring ear plugs or learn sign language if you want to sit on the patio."}
{"text":"The food was great!
Our server Cartier was both funny and knowledgable about the menu and drinks. Would definitely go back especially if she is working."}
{"text":"The only bad thing about all St.Louis is the size of the restaurant.  Everyone is packed like sardines and good luck when there's a Leaf game on.  It's a good thing their wings are fresh on Tuesdays because of how many they push out."}
{"text":"I love this place. You get what you expect. Above average wings, fast and nice service, a good atmosphere if a game is on, a great patio on a hot day. It's good times all around."}
{"text":"Love it so much Thursday half price on wings! Love it so much and I can't wait to eat there again the staff was nice  will recommend this place to anyone who visits Mississauga"}
{"text":"Ribs were falling off the bone tender. Service great. Wings small but tasty. As I stated in my check in the music being blasted is not to my liking but tolerable. Small location but no wait. I'll repeat that Rachael my server was very astute."}
{"text":"Showed up with an entire atom hockey team on very short notice. We had one waitress handle the entire group and she did a fantastic job. I love St Louis wings, they are just a little different from everyone else. You always get fries and dip with your wing order too. I will say however the wings were a little small and not as good as some other St Louis locations."}
{"text":"Service - F and food - D

Went into the restaurant today for an early dinner. Even though only a few tables were full and there were two servers the service was terrible. The servers spent all there time goofing with couple of people at the bar.

Ordered a pulled pork sandwich and wings. Neither the pork nor the sauce had any taste and the wings were dry and scrawny. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"I used to go to this location once or twice a week as its close to where I live. Last night I had a terrible experience with service of the bartender Filza. I was drinking beer and chatting with fellow patrons as well as with her and another trainee. 

Suddenly between 10 and 10:30 PM, the customer sitting beside me, who was having beer and chicken wings, just took off without paying. Right after that, bartender Filza handed me the cheque and asked me to pay up in-spite of the trainee's persuation not to do it. Filza expressed that I was badmouthing about the chicken wings to the customer thereby he left without paying. I couldn't believe my ears when she said that. I myself go there for having chicken wings on Tuesdays.To top it off, she put extra beer on my tab to make up part of the loss they incurred from the patron who fled.
On me asking to talk to the manager, she said \"I'm the manager right now\". So I put my credit card on the table in a rude,frustrated, curt way, which she took notice of and said \" I am giving you the courtesy to finish off your drink and leave but never ever throw card at me\" . I saw no point in arguing with an imbecile as she won't be able to sort out the problem on her own. The trainee apologized multiple times and said she shouldn't have done it. When I said \" I'll take care of it\", she replied \"You should\". Now that this incident happened, I will certainly share this with as many people as I can so that they don't face the same insult I have experienced."}
{"text":"My favourite place in the city to grab a coupla pounds of wings, a cold one, and watch the game with the boys! The place can be quiet around lunchtime, but gets quite loud at night, especially when the 'boys in blue' bury one top cheese. 

I have never had anything else on the menu expect the large order of wings - Suicide!
Their in-house dipping sauce is one of the best sauces I've ever tasted hands down which is probably the reason the place has done so well.  

Who cares about the service at this place - they know whats up with wings! 
can't wait for my next visit.

Also great for takeout, wish they would deliver!"}
{"text":"I waited for a total of 15 minutes. It took the vast majority of that for the waitress to even acknowledge my party was there. After a few more minutes of not receiving menus we just left. I wouldn't blame the waitress but rather the owner/manager for scheduling so few people on a weekend shift at dinner time. 

That being said, I've been to other locations that had great service and I like their wings."}
{"text":"DON'T EVER COME HERE!! THEIR SERVICE SUCKS ASS!!!

So I was here with 3 other girls on a Tuesday night.. at 6:30 ish and we got the 1/2 price wings with the purchase of a drink thing.  Everything was going well...until right after I finished my last bite of wings our waitress ran up to us and was like \" GIRLSSSS.. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE WAITING SO YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW\".

WHAT??..

WHAT??

I was so annoyed and shocked I was gonna be like WE ARE NOT DONE YET.. but my other 3 friends seemed to be okay with it so I kept my mouth shut. (lucky dumb bitch).

But SERIOUSLY??? WHO SAYS THAT?????????

It wasn't even like we kept on asking for a refill on WATER or something.  I still had some fries left AND half of my Caesar!!!!! 

It was SO rude!!!! We were there for ONLY a hr and 15 mins before she decided to shove her ass in and kick us out.

I'm SO glad this place is rated 2.5 stars.  Hope ya shut down soon!!!"}
{"text":"This is now my go to place for wings, been going to st.louis for years now.  I much prefer St. Louis over Wild Wing simply because Wild Wing just seems more homemade and the bar atmosphere is so much better at St. Louis.

This place can get busy during games and Tuesdays since they have the half off wings.  It's got a nice patio for summer time.  The overall feel is so much better than the Warden/Hwy 7location,  the Warden/Hwy 7 location just seems small and packed.

Love their unbreaded wings and the fries is unique!  Their in-house sauce that comes with the wings and fries is pretty yummy.

I've been here couple times with our one year old kid and have not had any issues, high tables, low tables, bar seats, they have everything.   Service is good so far but last Tuesday I went, because they were so busy we felt like we weren't taken care properly but I can understand!

I always feel like St. Louis is a very laid back place to just have some wings and some beer.  It's not as formal/fancy as some other bars, for example I wouldn't go into Jack Astor's and sit down myself just to have wings, I can do that with St. Louis."}
{"text":"For what it is, I'm happy with this place.  No comparison to a bar where you would normally take a girl on a date with, it's got its own niche.

I like the chill and lay back atmosphere of this place, I just wanna go there to have some wings and beer, nothing more.  For that I don't need to go to Real Sports Bar or Jack Astors.  Although I would agree that the food at those places is probably a level higher, but I like this place because it feels chill and not too formal.  Don't expect lots of huge screens but it's not enough coverage for sports fans.

Come here on Tuesday(half off Wings) or big raptors playoff games, you will find great atmosphere at the bar table.  Service is good, never had issues with service.

Sometimes I go to Wild Wings but I just find Wild Wings lacking something, although their wings are bigger.  Maybe it's the atmosphere?  It's like Subway vs Mr. Sub type of feeling if you know what I mean.

Like I said, just a chill and lay back no frill bar and grill with decent food, no complaint.  Lots of parking at the back of the building.  It also has patio seating for that hot summer night out with some friends."}
{"text":"Went here with friends to watch a world cup game. Ordered the salad with grilled chicken. Guess what, the \"grilled chicken\" wasn't really made of chicken. It was some kind of processed food that looked like chicken but tasted nothing like chicken. This is becoming a real problem. You order something and they serve something fake that is disguised as what you ordered to increase their profit margins. This deceptive behaviour should become illegal. How about me giving you fake dollar bills in return for the \"food\" you serve? How would you like that St.Louis?"}
{"text":"I only come here for the Buffalo Chicken Poutine, the best thing ever!!"}
{"text":"I, too, went with my buds for the WingExtravaganza.... what a disappointment.

We arrived about 6:00pm and the place was about a third full.  We got seated and presented with the menus.  Checked out the wing promo and compared it to the usual offering.  Seemed like the special was the way to go... the only issue, all guests at the same table had to order the special so no sharing would be possible.

All cool so far... we got our drinks and waited for the first delivery.  We got what appeared to be about 1/2 pound of wings and a huge basket of fries.  We were told we needed to finish off before placing the order for the next round.  It didn't didn't us long to finish off the 1/2 pound and fries.  Our server was very attentive so we waited a little before she came back to check up on us.  \"Ready for another round\" she asked and we said \"you bet!\"  This time we picked boneless to try them out.

About 25 minutes later the order arrived... four small pieces of white meat and a lot of fries piping hot (the fries that is, not the chicken).  The boneless 'wings' were overcooked and totally dry and inedible.

When we got the server's attention, we told her about the like hockey pucks and this time we ordered something saucy so there should be a less likely chance of being dry and tasteless.  About 25 minutes later again, the order arrived... 4 chicken bits and a pile of fries.  Even though the bits were sauced, they were luke warm and dry inside.

Another round?  again about 25 minutes passed and the server took our next order. we switched back to regular wings to avoid cracking our teeth on the dry chicken nuggets.

When we had our fill (mostly from drinks), we ended up getting about 1 1/2 pounds of wings each over the course of 4 1/2 hours!   It would have been a better value to have simply ordered the 2 pounds of wing with fries to be served more food in a lot less time!

They should have named it the fries extravaganza!"}
{"text":"I went to St. Louis for the all-you-can-eat wings promotion celebrating their 50th anniversary.

Unfortuntately, they weren't taking reservations during the promotion due to all the buzz it was creating.  According to the resto, it is impossible to gauge how long people would be sitting and I could understand that.

We got to St. Louis early at 6:30 and they were able to accommodate us pretty easily

For the promotion, you start with a pound to a pound and a half for your first order and subsequent orders come with 4 wings.  As your side, you can pick from fries or veggie sticks / vegetables but once you choose one though, you cannot change it for subsequent wing orders.  However, you are also allowed to order wings without the sides as well.

For the first few rounds, I ate the tried and tested flavours: hot and honey, honey garlic, and Buffalo ranch... But I also ventured out to try some more unique flavours such as boneless garlic parm, Mississippi Honey, and Caribbean Jerk.  The boneless, garlic parm wings were a welcomed surprise especially if you like them saucy- they were rich, crispy and creamy.  

The Caribben Jerk wings were too dry and intense in flavouring in my opinion.  The Mississippi Honey flavouring was a saucy combination of honey and barbecue sauce.  The barbecue sauce tasted like one of those primitive Kraft sauces you get at the supermarket... so it wasn't great.

The Sweet Asian wings were a good flavour profile change as the other wings were more savoury.  

I was starting to hit the wall at round 7 partially because the wait time between orders was increasing.  I wasn't sure if this was intentional or because they were busy...

But, I was tired of getting only 4 wings per order so I kindly asked for my last 3 rounds all at once and our server obliged.  I was a bit surprised she would let me do it but, to be honest, she was very accommodating to all our requests the entire night despite all the AYCE chaos around us.  She was pleasant to deal with and she was prompt with reorders and water requests. On top of that, she didn't rush us even though we were affecting her turnaround time... I mean we were there for a total of 4 hours!  She deserved a round of applause! 

Although, I've had some negative experiences in terms of service here in the past.  Often, servers can give attitude and are hard to flag down.  Even during my AYCE evening, we tried to order more wings with the server's assistant and we got, \"Well, I'm not your server, you have to order with her.\"  I also observed servers arguing with each other in the restaurant.

{"text":"Great sports bar. Typically go here for chicken wings and beer. Service is good. They hire young good looking girls who work hard. Everyday of the week there is some sort of special in terms of food. Have a great beer menu, I believe some local beers as well. There's tons of screens with your favourite sports on it. A recommendation is the chicken wing poutine. It will fill you up. Sometimes they use quite a lot of sauce on this dish. I come here every so often, good place."}

{"text":"If I could give this review no stars, I would. Unfortunately I have to select at least one star...

This location has the worst customer service I've ever experienced! Our server had the WORST attitude and did not bother to:

- bring us water
- ask for our order
- bring out burnt food
- split payments

She served the tables around us but for some reason neglected to serve us (there were 7 of us so it's not like she couldn't see us). Perhaps they were understaffed after the Blue Jays game but that is no excuse for horrible service. That is your job. To serve. In which that didn't happen. Needless to say, if you're planning on going here, don't. Spend your money elsewhere... There's other pubs nearby, or donate your money to help out the homeless."}
{"text":"Beautiful Sunday full of sunshine and I figure why don't I find a patio and have an ice cold brew and some wings. Place is close to home and haven't tried it since I moved into the area. Brew was cold!! Wings were hot but seemed small and overdone.  Also had the poutine which was OK but not wow.  If you are in the area it is a nice patio but the food/wings are better elsewhere."}

{"text":"Reliable place for decent, but not fabulous, wings, ribs, and beer. Order the wing lunch special - suicide hot (trust me it won't hurt you) and a pint of Stella.

The wings are definitely the best thing on the menu but could really be much meatier (pour on the growth hormones ;-) The ribs are ok but a bit bland and way too sweet and gooey for my taste. Beer selection is quite weak - domestic basics and Stella (yay!)."}
{"text":"Went to this location during their All-You-Can-Eat-Wings promo... The wings are outstanding, however the bar area in this location is extremely small - service was below adequate as the place was nearly empty and the servers were taking 10-15mins to seat ppl :/

Would only go to this location strictly for eating wings on wing promo nights - def not for watching sporting events, food, or drinks..."}
{"text":"This is a newer location and the food has the same quality as the other St Louis. I really like there share combo, but too bad it is limited time offer only"}
{"text":"Good spot to watch a game. 
 
St.Louis bar and grill is a classic bbq and pub joint to watch a game.  
The layout and decor is designed to appeal to sports lovers with multiple televisions set up around the 
restaurant so that restaurant-goers will be able to have multiple views of the game no matter where 
they are seated.  
 
In terms of a dining experience, I would rate St. Louis as just being 'okay' or mediocre. I can't exactly say 
the food taste great or bad, but just 'okay.' St. Louis offers the usual menu of food a classic bbq joint 
would offer such as wings, ribs, fries, burgers, and beers. 
 
I have to mention that the food prices are a little bit pricey so I would recommend ordering the daily 
special to cut your bill in half. 
 
I only rated St. Louis 3 out of 5 stars because in my opinion, the food quality isn't quite up to par with 
the slightly high prices.  
 
In short, St. Louis is more of a spot to watch the game with friends over drinks and bbq as opposed to 
strictly just dining."}
{"text":"I know this place didn't get a lot of good reviews but I'd like to take a moment to share my thoughts on this establishment. 

I found the service, food and atmosphere to be great and while the location is pretty small and cramped, it's not busy enough to really bother me.

The one great thing about this place is the Angus Burger & the beer. Speaking of beer, it isn't watered down and tastes great unlike some other bars and restaurants in the city (I'm looking at you Boston Pizza!). 

The daily specials are great with the best specials being on Tuesday (1/2 off wings) Wednesday ($5 pints and burger) & Thursday (1/2 off starters). 

Would be a good place to go watch a sports game or hang out with friends. Nothing else in the plaza in terms of being able to sit down and chill out (except maybe for the McDonalds across the plaza). 

There is a patio outside, but seeing as it is winter, I haven't used it yet. 

Great place, great service and great food. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The staff are idiots. We stood there for 10 minutes in the front of the line. The hostess deliberately ignored is, while another patron budded infront of us. I tried to say something about it and she made racist remarks towards me. The food there is also shit, comes out cold and gross. They also don't clean the lines which feed their taps properly, so tge beer tastes like mould. The hostess has shit for brains."}

Extra information:

*Over 10 flavors of wings
*Half price wings on Tuesdays
*Undercover Patio

This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto so far. I've always wanted to find my ultimate chicken and beer place and this is it! Again, this is so conveniently located near my house and it was impossible not to try it because every time I pass by this place, I can smell the chicken wings.

On Tuesdays they have half price wings special so that's the day to visit if you are ever interested. You can choose between 1lb (~7-9 wings) for $10.99 or 2lb for $19.99 from 16 different types of flavors. Flavors vary from the typical honey garlic, bbq, buffalo as well as hot flavors called 'hotter than hell' or 'suicide'. They are all served with French fries and garlic dill sauce.

I ordered 1lb of Caribbean Jerk and 1lb of Hot & Honey as well as Onion rings. The wings were SO GOOD!! It's THE best chicken wings I've ever had. Outside was so crispy with the skin perfectly fried and the meat was super juicy. I preferred Hot&Honey flavor over Caribbean Jerk flavor because the Caribbean Jerk had too much rosemary for my likings. Warning for those who can't eat spicy food, Hot&Honey had 2 chili signs and it was quite spicy for me! And the French fries that came with the chicken wings were super delicious. The fries are quite thick but they make it so crispy and they are served super hot it goes so well with the chicken wings when washed down with icey cold beer.

Onion rings are kind of on the pricey side but they are so worth the price. Their onion rings are so sweet inside and perfectly fried and it's perfect with the ranch sauce that comes with it.

 Summary: I would go back here any day! They serve other types of food as well but you find most of the people ordering chicken wings and beer. Best wings ever!!"}
{"text":"I've been to just about every St. Louis in the city, but this location used to be like my home base.  A new location opened at Fairview Mall, so that's my new standard now.

Anyway.  If you've been to one St. Louis, you've pretty much been to all of them. Although this particular location is a bit small and cramped, the great food and atmosphere make up for the lack of space.  Service was always fast and friendly, never had a problem.

Typical sports bar fare here, lots of tv's playing sports, Raptors jerseys and other sports memorabilia adorn the walls, your usual standards.  

Every time I go I opt for the \"hotter than hell\" wings, which are quite spicy, but are also quite tasty.  Wings come with fries and that yummy dill sauce.  You can also buy bottles of the dips and sauces for home use if you're so inclined. 

If you love wings, give St. Louis a shot.  The wings aren't as big as say, Duff's, but they're far tastier in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch once.

Food: Ordered 1 lb. honey garlic original wings with sweet potato fries (was able to substitute from regular fries). The sweet potato fries were thin cut, crispy and seasoned well. The dill sauce was a tasty companion to both the fries and wings. Overall, yummy! 

Service & Atmosphere: Not sure if it was due to low peak hours but the waitress was attentive and regularly checked up on us. 

Pricing: There are daily specials on the menu which are worth coming here for. Pricing of wings was fair for location."}
{"text":"Not impressed but it was convenient at the time. Getting 2 stars for the location (short walk from Union Station) and their chicken. 

Walked in, waited for someone to seat me because my friend was on her way, totally got ignored and the group that came in after me was seated before me.  

After getting seated and getting our order, the waitress totally forgot that she was in the middle of cleaning the table next to us and left her tray on the chair then sat a group there. Definitely made the place feel less sanitary.

Luckily the food was good. Tried their new chicken and waffles. The chicken was on point as usual but the waffles were a bit soggy from the sauces and it tasted confused... like it didn't know if it was supposed to be savory or sweet.

Overall, the restaurant was small, crowded and loud. Definitely not good if you're trying to have a conversation. I swear I almost lost my voice in there. Also we definitely didn't see our waitress again until we had to pay. Would not come back to this location though."}
{"text":"With the way the economy has been, it's always nice to get a good deal, bang for the buck if you will. My coworker and I came for Half Price wings. What more can you ask for? Delicious wings at half the price? Score!

Melissa was our server for the evening. A very pleasant young lady she is. Very cheerful and welcoming. She knew exactly what beverages were available and what wasn't.

Food came out lightning fast (hot) as if it was already waiting for us, made to order. Devilishly good it was.

. What more can I say about St. Louis Vaughan, other than staff makes every customer feel like they're at home."}
{"text":"Decided to go eat some wings with the girlfriend - yeah me - I got a girlfriend. We went on the notorious tuesday where wings are half off ! YEAH HALF OFF, well you can't really go wrong with half price wings right?! What was really great was their turnover rate, they cleaned tables quick and got people in and out real quick, so when my girlfriend and I arrived we quickly got seated even though there was a huge crowd in the front. First stop the washroom, my bladder was on one fam, went to the washroom and it was clean as hell, it smelt clean like i would eat my chicken wing in there. Our lovely server which i didn't get the name of quickly came to us and asked us if we wanted any drinks then we ordered the food. We ordered 2 lbs of wings Garlic Parm and Hot sweet asian just like my girlfriend mhmmmm ;) and the fish tacos cause who doesn't like tacos right? Service wasn't the best but it's a tuesday night and wings are half off, and its a full house so what do you expect?

THE FOOD: I was really diggin the wings, Garlic Parm and Hot Sweet Asian were perfect, it didn't taste frozen it tasted fresh never frozen. But the fish tacos were a disapointment, but i mean who gets tacos at a bar and grill right? Silly us. It was too bland, the ratio of fish to cabbage/lettuce wasn't even, I thought I was eating a tortilla with lettuce and it definetly needs more sauce on that joint, it was drier than my black friends ankles.

Would I go back ? HELL YEAH.
WINGS. HALF OFF.
THAT'S IT."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the negative comments listed. My wife and I love \"wing nite\" and have eaten at a number of Wing restaurants from Bradford to Aurora.

10 drums
Plastic containers(who cares about pbf's)

{"text":"I've only had the waffle and chicken here and that's probably the only reason I'd keep coming, I'd recommend having the hot sauce on the side though! I'm sure men would like it as a sports bar, the girls wear short skirts and there's enough TV's."}
{"text":"Honestly some of the worst food I've ever had. I was in town for a convention, this restaurant was the closest to the hotel so I was hoping to grab a quick bite to eat before I had to get back. 45 minutes later I still didn't have my food. 20 more minutes to close out my bill and have my food packed to go. Got to the hotel and ate my food during work. The worst chicken burger I've ever had. Do not go here if you are on a time crunch or expect decent food."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple times.  Good food and good service.  Had a burger one time and tried chicken waffles for the first time ever on the second visit.  Recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"After a nice stroll the bf & I decided to have some beer here. The location is pretty convenient to get to so traffic is never an issue. 

They seat you pretty fast and considering it was mid week, it was still pretty busy. There was a football game going on (to which I lost the bet to) so the atmosphere is quite loud. We ended up with the wings & beer combo special. 

The service is casual but friendly and personable. The drinks came quick, the refills were taken care of on point and the wet napkins were delivered right about the last few wings were to be devoured . 
The potato fries are my favourite here. I especially enjoy the dill sauce they give you on the side. 

The waitress noticed how fast we went through it and decided to bring us 2 more. This made us quite jolly. 

fun fact: I really appreciated the separation of the bar area from the booths. This gives people a chance to come hang out without bumping into rowdy game watchers. 

wings&beer for 2 = $32.63 
with tip $39.63

{"text":"Ive posted a review for this place before but now im updating it. Last 4 times I visited them since, the experience has been subpar (including last time when I actually got a comp on the food because the chicken quesadilla was just terrible). 

I remember back when I first moved into the area I used to visit this bar alot, I genuinely enjoyed dining/drinking/watching sports there but it seems to have gone downhill since. They updated their menu again and this new one is just all over the place def not a fan (too flashy and focuses more on photo effects of food than food info itself).

They dont play sound on their tv's, you cant smoke on the patio anymore AND servers genuinely look like they dont give a sh*t anymore.

Def wont be going there again."}
{"text":"Came here one time, half price wings are a good deal. Decent sized wings, fries, and good staff that refills drinks and are friendly"}
{"text":"The food is great here, but this chain is terrible. The service is poor and the place is way too small. They charge extra for everything. The staff is not friendly and one of them is quite rude. They really need to work on their customer service skills. 

Ordered a cocktail drink but didn't specify 1 oz liquor or 2 oz liquor and they automatically charged me for the more expensive option. I asked the waitress about it and she said that they always do that if people don't specify. Shouldn't it be the other way around ?

I also orders lightly sauced wings because often times they put too much sauce. When it came it was too dry so I asked them for some sauce on the side. They automatically said that will be extra cost but I argued that I asked for less sauce and I shouldn't be charged if I'm asking for a bit more. The waitress said maybe I shouldn't order less sauce next time. This just illustrates the lack of customer service skills ?"}
{"text":"St. Louis Bar and Grill is tucked away in a food plaza in North Mississauga.  They have some great lunch specials for under $10.  You can get a hefty cheese bacon burger with fries for $8.99!  What you get is the standard pub fare, it is greasy good.

Service was descent for the lunch time crowd.

If you are looking for a standard pub grub in the area, try out St. Louis Bar & Grill!"}
{"text":"I really like wings in this place and I think it is good for wings. Enjoying a Heineken and spicy wings is so nice maaan. However,  as a tip,  always ask separate orders even if you are with your girlfriend/boyfriend. They will give you more fries."}
{"text":"Went to St. Louis during a heated Raptors VS. Cavs game and I loved the ambiance in the room! St. Louis Bar & Grill is an excellent spot for sport fanatics, and the room was absolutely jammin' with loud jeers and crazy energy! We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for 4 at about 9 PM. Didn't really mind the wait, but showed that the place is usually busy, especially on game days. 

Ordered 1 pound of the Garlic Parm wings and it was packed with flavour! However, I wasn't that big of a fan because it wasn't saucy, it was pretty dry with parmesan on top. So, if you're into saucy wings like me, I would recommend the typical Honey Garlic. Wings come with super awesome potato wedges with an amazing ranch/dill sauce. Dipping the wings into the ranch sauce is highly recommended, truly elevates the flavour of the juicy chicken. Speaking of chicken, it's never dry here! Definitely one of my favourite wings places. My friend ordered a burger and he also enjoyed his meal greatly.

Also, if you have SPC, they'll give you a free poutine upgrade! However, indulging naked wedges in his full glory without masking the flavours with gravy and cheese is what I love most."}
{"text":"As always its a busy place to eat , long wait like... long..30minutes to 45minutes before your order comes. 
Servers so busy, need to hire more. 
We called the server 3x they said ill be right back but no....
Food was good, no complaints."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night because I love st.louis wings. But I noticed there was only one girl serving and as she was serving she was also handling the bar, with one man in the kitchen preparing foods. It was a busy night for a Monday and I felt really bad for the her since had to do everything herself, including the BOH staffs. Management should be better. Felt bad for the poor girl, she did great though..with all the tables she was handling."}
{"text":"Probably one of my worst dining experiences ever.  I would give negative stars if I could.  I'm generally a positive person, but it was just bad.  Our server was pleasant given her working conditions but that's about all the good I can say. 

This place was filthy and we should have walked right out but my hubby was craving nachos.  So we stayed even after we realized the air conditioning was not on (it is one of the hotter days in the year).  The table felt sticky and grimy, plates had a layer of grime as well.

Food - had the classic poutine and the nachos to share with my husband and 6 year old daughter.  For $10, I would expect a pretty amazing poutine and a much bigger serving than we received.  The nachos were something I could have easily put together at home.  The salsa it comes with was gross.  The jalapeños were chopped up finely and made up the majority of the toppings.  It was hot.  You would think that after telling the waitress that we were all sharing, she would have mentioned that we might want to get jalapeños on the side if sharing with our young daughter.  We could barely eat it.

The cider I had tasted like it had been watered down with apple juice.  There was ice in it as well, which I'm not accustomed to.

Needless to say, we will not be returning and i am shocked that they are still in business."}
{"text":"Always come here for wing especially Tuesday specials. Be aware that they do get packed with lots of students on Tuesday's as its close by UofT campus. The service is hit or miss depending on who serve you especially during rush hour. I'm giving it three star as food is always good and service is mediocre."}
{"text":"great wings, good specials, limited beer choices, good service... probably the best choice in the hood for sports patio etc."}
{"text":"I've been to St.Louis all over the GTA for years .. I love their concept and their wings
This location seems perfect, along with the staff and the setup .. huge lcd screens, great lighting, and absolutely great service ..
The only thing that threw me off is the wings tasted somewhat stale, like old precooked wings you get in some sketchy bars ..
I love the wings at St.Louis so I cant say what went wrong, but please fix this and I'll be a loyal customer again .."}
{"text":"I was given a wing voucher by the CEO - a very nice gentleman.

However, I was disappointed by this location 

- service was less than desirable
- no napkins
- no bone dish
- no crayons for young children

Food was satisfactory but made less appealing by the service."}
{"text":"Try their chicken bucket deal.  $15.99 for a bucket of butter milk chicken and a large pint of bud with Cole slaw. Sweet deal."}
{"text":"Service was horrible.  Server didn't even acknowledge us when we came in, but looked over at us. We waited a few minutes until another one came to seat us.  We patiently waited more than 20 minutes to order until I had to get up and ask our server if we could order.  She claims she didn't see us since we were seated in the corner, but I know for a fact she made eye contact with us and even walked by to help out another table near us.  When it came time to pay, she was no where to be found and we had to ask another server to find her so we could get our bill.  Now this was the icing on the cake, we needed the debit/credit machine to pay, but our server again felt it was more important to sit in the corner with the debit machine in her hand and gossip with her other coworkers while she made us wait.  I highly suggest you drive a few minutes east to the Yonge and Finch location.  Much better service, better servers, and overall better location."}
{"text":"Went Saturday evening and I was surprised to see how small this location was! My boyfriend and I walked in looked around and waited for someone to seat us and saw a waitress drinking from a mug looking disinterested in serving us later on pointing out that we can sit where ever we wanted from across the restaurant. I thought that was bad service, she didn't even acknowledge us and was more busy drinking then to come serve us. We sat down and waited for someone to bring us a menu, they took too long so we just grabbed one from the reserved table behind us that didn't show up. After a few minutes of reviewing the menu the waitress decides to bring the other menu.... We got a tasty burger and wing and rib combo. Both were well made that's why I gave the 1 star. Oh yeah they ran out of Stella by 7 pm... 
Sorry but we ran out of change for tip as well. It was undeserved. The waitresses there looked unhappy to be there. Worst St.Louis I've ever been to. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We went there yesterday and it was gross.  Everything we got we didn't like.  And it was really overpriced.  I had the veggie burger and fries and it was gross.  We also had their caesar salad which was bland.  And the nachos and steak was more like roast beef.  The only thing that I ate that was good was the fries."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. We waited over 15 mins to even get offered a drink or food. It continued like that throughout the meal. I will not o back."}
{"text":"Good quality food! Though very small and always slamed, the waitors are not around much and some of them have attitudes. But eh, i go there for hockey nights only."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!! NOT kid friendly! The manager said \"your stroller is a fire hazard\" What?!?!"}
{"text":"** my review was in limbo in another location so moved it where it should be

This location has just opened where the Swiss Chalet used to be at Danforth and Carlaw.  They have done a semi reno, blowing out the kitchen area replaced with a bar.  The table and chairs, some art work, and design are somewhat a recycled version of what was there.  I`m surprised that a place that has only just opened in the last two weeks is not that clean.  The dust on the retractable doors is an eyesore, the floors are mucked up and it`s not even winter, the bathrooms were not fresh and the pictures on the wall already have spot stains.  

On to food.  We were the only table being that it was 4pm.  We ordered 3 Large Wings, mild, medium and hot&honey.  We asked the server how hot was the medium compared to mild, she said that there was no difference in heat that the mild compared to  medium was in the amount of sauce.  Never heard that one before.

She was great to the kids and very friendly, but who has given her the cue to wear a skirt so short that as she walked by you could actually see her underwear.  

The large orders consists of about 16 wings and comes with fries (big chunky crinkle frozen jobs), and their signature dip (dill mayo sour cream mix).  I don`t really like the sterile packages it comes in feels a bit cafeteria instead of pub.

We really just couldn`t understand how the wings arrived luke warm!!  We were the only table and they should have been piping hot to handle.  They were overcooked dry, except for the hot and honey which were saucy and I think masked the dry bits.   

I'm going out on a limb here but I think this franchise restaurant is commissary style.  Those were not fresh cooked in the least.  Another funny thing you get about 10 fries with each large order thrown on top of the wings.  Not that you need a tonne of fries but you would assume large wings, large fries.

This neighbourhood is family all over it and I don't think a dirty pub with big screen TV's badly cooked over priced wings and sexy servers is going to cut rug.  Good luck to them, but I will not be back.

1 star for our server who worked hard and one star for the company I was with.

3 large orders of wings w/fries
4 Beers
Jug of Pop      $94.62 + 15 tip. 

That was 4 tweens and 2 adults"}
{"text":"Service is great, food was brought out extremely fast.

Smoked BBQ heat was incredible, a must try for anyone who loves wings.

Location is great for sports fans with TVs everywhere."}
{"text":"Mediocre wings, salad, frites and service. Service was nothing special. I guess with the great weather today, the servers rather be sitting on the patio having a beer than serving on the patio. Employees looked tired and miserable. The place could use a good cleaning, like sweep the floors etc. A cutting board with oranges, limes and lemons were sitting out in the open.  I had better wings at Gabby's!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite St. Louie's location, but it sure is convenient after work.
Located inside the Atrium on Bay, it's right on the subway line and next to the Eaton Center.

A huge bonus is that this place takes reservations for big groups on a Tuesday wing night, Duff's does not...

Half-price wings are awesome.  I usually order 1 pound of hot and honey wings, but went with the 2 pounds! ...That's a lot of wings and they let you pack leftovers... which many wing places won't let you do on wing night.

I upgraded to sweet potato fries, which were skinny and tasty, and came with a plastic container of the chipotle mayo.  But for the additional charge +$1.99, next time I'll just go with the regular fries which are still good.

The staff was friendly and when we asked to put the Leafs game on, they happily did so! :)

Good wings... Decent service...  But I prefer a rowdier place to watch a game."}
{"text":"2 stars...
Its an average place with average food and average service.
No real complaints. But like previous poster mentioned it not \"juicy\" or anything wonderful to mention.
We had wing/rib combo and did find ribs dry but nothing horrible.
(Didn't really care for the \"peel top\" dipping sauce, seemed too pre fab for me.) And be be prepared to pay extra if you or you guest would like a side sauce.


Sadly for most Whitby/Brooklin doesn't really have \"great\" wings."}
{"text":"I end up going to St.Louis only for the specials.

My favourite one though is their Thursday half price appetizers! Funny enough, I'll be heading there tonight for this exact reason!

St.Louis tends to be a bit better in my books to places like Jack Astors, Milestones etc. 

Their fries and dill sauce together is absolute heaven! If you haven't tried it, you gotta! 

I've also been here for their (i think) Wednesday $5 Angus burgers, which were very .... $5. You get what you pay for, but it comes with fries so that's a plus! 

I suggest not coming here with children past 9PM, as it's a very adult crowd later at night (but why would you past that time?). I don't know how it is in the day time since I usually come here after 10pm on every visit, but the music can get EXTREMELY loud mixed in with the loud tv's. I sure wouldn't mind if they turned down the music just a bit!

St.Louis has become my hang out and catch up with friends place, with great food specials! Great service with getting you seated real quick, and taking your order. I do recommend!"}
{"text":"The waitress/hostess seated the group that came after us first. Clearly she made a mistake but she said because that was a 4 people table, so she seated the 4 people group first. There's 3 of us in my group, is there such thing as 3 people table? Seriously? The single tables are only big enough to fit 2 people. I looked around all the 3 people groups were seated with 4 people table too. Just admit your mistake, it was busy I understand.

Had to ask for our utensils 3 time before we get them.

Slow service, mediocre food. 
 
Would rather go to and recommend other locations."}
{"text":"This location is very small in comparison to the Scarborough town location. Very few tables to people ratio on a Tuesday night with the half price wings special, which led to a whooping 3 hour wait until my friends and I got seats when we were told it was a 1 hour waiting time. 

Most people choose to wait for their table in the mall, so don't be fooled by how few people appear to be waiting when you look through the windows. Always go in and get your name on the wait list as soon as you arrive at Fairview! We made the mistake of shopping around first. 

The wings were good for the most part, and the fries were delicious as always. However, I found that a good third of my honey garlic wings were dry and sauce-less. A friend tried the Caribbean Jerk flavour and it was downright awful; would definitely not recommend it! I instantly
wiped the sauce/dry rub off my tongue when I tried it. 

Our server was attentive and generally great considering the situation. One of the two stars is solely for her. 

Overall, I prefer the Scarborough town location in all aspects and will most likely not return to this location anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch, service was great but I didn't love the food. Just had a salad and half quesadilla so it was probably poor selection on my behalf. Service was really great, would go again and try something else. The fish tacos looked nice. You can have a quick in and out lunch on your lunch break too."}
{"text":"Awesome chicken wings are done right, but recent visit there not that great not sure if it's the cook or if it under different management"}
{"text":"Really enjoy coming to this bar because they have trivia every Monday evening. The host is hilarious and friendly. There's no fee to participate and winning table gets a free pitcher of beer.

If you've been to any st Louis it's pretty standard. But the crowd and the servers here are great. Really fun atmosphere. I like how they have themed food and drinks. For example, uefa is going on so they had cheap mixed shots for some of the countries. They're more so sugary and \"girly\" shots if you will. They have lots of booths and tables where large groups can sit. Their outdoor patio is quite large for a bar on yonge street. It was really hot the day I went and it was nice to see them have a cool refreshing mist blowing to keep customers cooler.

My friends and I usually come down just for Trivia night and it was always a blast. Definitely recommend coming here. I mean come on...use your noggin' for free beer? Umm...heck yes!"}
{"text":"1 star. Came after wonderland. The bar & server crew was very unprofessional. 2 girls were on break and sat beside us that worked there & were running around and yelling and screaming. So loud I could not hear my friend that sat in front of me. My food was also burnt along with my cousins. Would not go back. They need to hire or retrain staff for professionalism."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this location. I love going to st Louis on a Tuesday for their special but I tend to avoid this location. They charge more for extra dill dipping sauce and they don't allow for the take out container. This is annoying cause it's the only location that does this. I only come here if im nearby or forced by my friends."}
{"text":"Lots of tv with sports, good waiting staff and tasty food with a reasonable price. If you are staying nearby hotel ask if they give you discount too :)"}
{"text":"My husband, 2 year old, 4 month old and I came here on a Wednesday. The location was packed. When we arrived and were seated we were only given one menu between us. Upon taking our orders we had to request a beverage for our son long after she brought our drinks. 
Wait time for food was reasonable given it was very busy. 
We received our food and it was typical bar food. During our meal our server never returned to ask if we wanted more water, or drink refills. 
When we were finished she did not ask if we wanted dessert or anything else and we had to wait a while to receive our bill. 
Overall, food was ok, service was poor."}
{"text":"The food was very good and was served rather quickly although my girlfriend and I were the only people there! The pull pork sandwich was a bit small however delicious and the fries were incredible  at the end of the meal it took a long time to receive the bill and waitress did not come back to the table. Overall it was a nice place to get food and I will return again"}
{"text":"Great chicken wings! Even better Half Price Wing Night! I like their Frank's dry rub. No messy, great to dip on their St. Louis sauce. Their hot water machine never work though, so no hot coffee or tea."}
{"text":"I have written 40 reviews on here, and I have to give this place its dues :) 

I have been coming here for 2 years as a customer now, its my go to place for a beer.

They have very friendly staff, as well as its own little community of people that come in regularly.   Credit management for hiring great people. Credit people that go there for good attitudes on enjoying :) 

How to use this place:   

Tuesday is Wing Night (half price wings)
Thursdays Karaoke after 9pm 
Sporting Events (they order UFC)
Live Bands (Saturdays)
Every evening after work crowd for a beer

New bonus information, they just renovated the place, have a new manager that took over who really seems to notice the little details.

I like this place.   Try it for a pint or dinner :)"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of chicken wings, and I like to try different places but I can tell you guys, that St. Louis has never disappointed me.
Wings are a standard size, a pound is about 7-9 wings  (not only 5 like in other places), and you can either choose them to be dry or saucy. They always taste great tome, with a side of their fries, and the dill dip... mmmmm

Very recommended if you feel like having some pub fare, at a very friendly place."}
{"text":"Food is great but service is poor. They are always understaffed. The servers are poorly trained and often get your order wrong. Great place to go when you are craving wings. Just have to bare with the poor service and slow service."}
{"text":"This St. Louis is really close to the Dave and Busters and IMAX Cineplex which makes it a great location. I've been here once before on a Wednesday and we couldn't get seats (I assume it was due to the half-price game Wednesday deal at Dave and Busters). I came again on a Sunday before watching a movie at Cineplex and thought their service was really fast. 

Our wings and appetizers came out within 15 minutes and we were done eating in 30 mins. Super satisfied with the timing because that left us with more than enough time to head to our movie. I also find that this location gives a decent amount of wings (unlike some locations which give you only very little wings)."}
{"text":"I mean half price appes on a Thursday?! How can you hate on that! Bonus, they have a Pokémon stop right outside so you can collect more balls and prizes whole you dine! Not to mention there's plenty of Pokémons to catch too. They should put a lure and make it even more alluring for Pokémon gamers:p 

Anyway, back to the food. It was aiight. You can get your deep fried foods fix here. Nothing to write home about. Though big ups to their dipping sauces! Stars there!

I'll come back to watch a game here. Their daily specials are worth it!"}
{"text":"Service is good.  Tried the Chicken and waffles and pulled pork poutine...definitely would order again, bit want to try other items...hubby and I couldn't finish but packed to go to snack on later.  We'll definitely be back since you can't find this place back home."}
{"text":"Average chain-of-the-mill beer and wings place. I was surprised there was such a large St. Louis Bar here, considering all the boutique and/or pub like places on King Street that would have a lot more beer choices.

I came here to meet 20+ friends...a reunion of sorts and we were given an area all to ourselves. Service was excellent and there was no problem handling individual bills. Our group had pitchers of Rollingrock beers (one of my faves) and I had wings and fries.

Can't say this place stands out and I would much rather go have beers at other places on King Street, but having said that, this place can accomodate large groups."}
{"text":"My first review of this place went something like this: \"This place sucks.\"
But it lacked first hand experience, and so it was removed.

My second review about this place goes something like this:
I feel cluster phobic, it's so small that I've never seen any more than one waitress working here at one time.  The food takes absolutely eons to arrive, even when the whole place is empty. 
Drop ceiling, poor choice of wall paint, horrible natural lighting..this place is as interesting as the parking lot it stares out at.  Nothing like frozen wings and watching people park their cars.
The wet naps I was given kept turning out to be not wet at all.  It was just pieces of paper folded into a little square.  I ordered more...and more turned out to be dry.  WHAT THE HELL?!  So I wiped my greasy wing sauce covered hands all over the damn table.  

This place sucks."}
{"text":"We came here to watch the UFC.  We had fries and wings, and they did not disappoint.
We opted to sit in the upstairs area where it was less crowded, and less noisy.
The waitress was a total dummy, but her niceness kind of made up for it....
If she had an attitude, she would have received zero tip."}
{"text":"We often come here on a Tuesday for half price wings. We don't mind the wait times because you can walk around the mall while you wait and they will call you when your table is ready. It's usually between 20 minutes to an hour. I find that it's always worth the wait though. The food is delicious and servers are quick and friendly. I've come here on Fridays and Saturdays as well and received the same great quality of meals and service. We have always received food in a decent amount of time and were consistently checked on by servers to make sure everything was okay. 

Recently went in on a Tuesday around 2pm and they had extended their half price wing special to ALL DAY during the summer only (usually 4pm-close), so that was a great surprise! We will continue going to this location and look forward to half price wings."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place many times over the years and it's usually pretty decent. Service ok, and the wings yummy. 
However, recently I came in to grab a quick pint and sat in open view while 3 employees sat and gossiped at a table, even looking over at me a few times and then deciding to continue their conversation.
I get it, you're not busy, but come on - that's just rude and terrible service. I hope a manager reads this as the staff needs a wake up call. 
Eventually the girl who served me was very nice but she was left alone while all the others just sat and chit chatted. I don't think I will come back."}
{"text":"It's a St. Louis which would generally get a 3 star rating. I mean wings are wings...we're not talking craft, local, homemade here (you know what you're getting into). This is a place for beer, tv, watching a big sports event etc...

It's two start because service was non-existent. Didn't take drink orders until it was already time to order food and no checking up at all. Been to other locations and service was great."}
{"text":"I met with my sister for lunch and shopping here. I had a buffalo wrap, and she had the tacos. We sat on the patio (not much of a view, as it faces the Parking lot on the north side of sheppard) and chit chatted. It was nice to be able to chill on the patio, but the poor server was obviously frazzled; he had a few tables both inside and outside, while the female servers (whose uniforms are borderline beach wear - like visible butt cheeks) had perhaps one table to look after and took their time. While their uniforms did make it more comfortable for them in the warm weather, the gentleman server wore I think a black polo and black dickies. 
When we got our food, it was about 25-30 mins after we ordered, but obviously not the servers fault. It was, well, nothing out of this world. Decent tasting I guess. My iced tea was overly sweet, and my sisters tacos were definitely not worth the price. Teeny and blah.
I don't think I would recommend any one going here but I wouldn't steer them away either. Hit or miss I guess. I do hate the ladies' uniforms though. Just because you make and sell wings doesn't entitle you to be the ass-end of Hooters."}
{"text":"I ordered a Friday special, which is a Ribs and Wings Combo. Somehow, I don't like the dressing for the coleslaw, too much vinegar. The wings are marinated with sweet and sour dressing. It's on the sweet side but the taste is not bad. The wings can be bigger. The ribs taste good. They are not too dry but can be more tender. That's my personal preference."}
{"text":"We went in a group of 15 and was declined a table, although there was availability, on a Tuesday half off wings night.  We were told the large table would affect their turn over rate with smaller tables by the owner.

What an outrageous way of running a biz.  The last time we were there our bill came to almost $700 with only 8 of us.  We drink like fishes even though we won't eat a lot.

We ended up going to another place and spent over $1000.

We complained to head office and since it's a franchise they can't do anything but warn the owner.

The owner of this location is absolutely rude!  One time a waitress gave me somebody's bill, as they claimed as an error, and if I did not check I could've paid double.  Made a complaint but had no reply from them at all.

Will never come to this location again!!!"}
{"text":"Friday Beer & Wings!  Checked this place out for lunch with a couple of guys from work.  Wasn't expecting much, but the wings were pretty awesome.  

Small but well seasoned and most importantly, had an amazingly light and totally crisp exterior, all the way around.   I dislike overly saucy/soggy wings, so I ordered the original (bone-in), Frank's Red Hot Dry Rub with Smoked BBQ Heat sauce on the side.  Wings arrived quick, fresh & hot (possibly b/c the place wasn't too busy)The dry rub was a bit too salty (I'm going to try the cajun dry rub next time) but the Smoked BBQ heat was delicious (a little does a long way).  The meat wasn't the most tender I've ever had, but the crisp exterior makes up for everything!

Server was pleasant & helpful.  Told me I could sub out my fries for carrots & celery sticks at no extra cost.  Garlic-dill dipping sauce was also awesome.  I think this is our new Friday beer & wings spot.

Tip: If 1lbs of wings is too little and 2lbs is too much, you can order 1lb + a 1/2 lb side order without having to deal with extra fries."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Went there on a Thursday as my mom and I hadnt eaten all day long.  It was 1/2 priced appetizers/sharables on this day so that was great.

Ordered the bacon wrapped mac & cheese as it sounded delish and we got a side of Wings with the free side order of fries.


food and service was a 4 star.  But this place gets an extra star because of Julie who is a supervisor there.  She was outstanding.  She walked to all tables in our area and chatted with them to make sure all was great.  she even took dirty dishes away and go refills.  I have been to a few establishments where a manager/supervisor thinks a job is beneath them they wont do it.  She was total opposite.  If im ever back in Toronto i would come back here because of Julie.   


The bacon wrap Mac & cheese was as good as it sounds.  HOT.  it burnt my tounge but excellent. No way would i pay full menu price for it though as it was pretty high.


Too bad i missed Tuesday night as  it was 1/2 priced wing night.  


Anyways a good place to go if you go on the right day with the right special lol.



But would recommend this location cause of Julie and you can tell her the people from Colorado think she is awesome."}
{"text":"3 stars. I had the chilli. My friend had the chicken waffle and loved it. Mine was quite average. Server was friendly."}
{"text":"My bf and I went here after a show of The Railway Children (more depressing than I thought a kids show would be, but anyhoo...). After having a greasy fried egg, potato and sausage breakfast in the morning, we thought having wings and beers for dinner would be less artery clogging. This St. Louis is right beside the Rogers Center so I can only bet that during a game or event, this place must be packed!

But for a lazy Sunday afternoon, it was pretty quiet (but then after we were seated, 20 people game in...) It's pretty small inside and its got a decent patio, but today, we decided to sit inside to escape the heat. I have been to other St. Louis' locations but I have to say this place is not half bad! I took advantage of the Rolling Rock (MY NEW FAVE BEER) special where you get a nice big glass of the beer plus a platter of wings and onion rings for around 13.99 I think. The wings were dry (the way I like mine) and it featured the chilli and lime flavour. 

Don't worry though. All of the wings come with that delectable white sauce that makes every thing taste good, so my bf and I went on a dunking binge...everything went into that white sauce.

Service I can only assume may be hit or miss with any bar establishment, but today it was a hit. Our servers were very smiley and sun-shiney.

I think this is a nice place to visit on a quiet Sunday afternoon, especially if you want nothing fancy but to have nice cold beers and wings. Definitely will be coming back if I am ever in the area."}
{"text":"Out of all the St. Louis locations in the Markham area this one is the most well-rounded in terms of their service, food, and the atmosphere/parking. 

The wait times are not as half as long as the one on Warden and Hwy 7 and the servers working here are so much friendlier! I like that it's also spacious and not crammed like the other location, which almost felt like I was eating with the table next to me. 

The wings are saucy and not dried out! For once I can taste the flavour of what I ordered and not just battered chicken that is sometimes raw when bitten into. Appropriate portioning of fries and wings enough to fill you up esp. during the half price wing nights, which happens every Tuesday. (You have to order a drink in order to receive half price on the wings) 

Definitely my go-to wing spot on Tuesday nights!"}
{"text":"I have been going to St.Louis since I was a young kid but there is something wrong about this location's wings. They are constantly terrible.

Every other location tastes the same delicious taste, but this location's wings always taste like half-cooked pieces of cardboard. Not only do they get way too busy with ryerson and UofT students on cheap night with hour waits because they have zero seating- but I wouldn't wish these wings on humans.

Go to any other location- like the one at the Atrium on Bay- trust me. Stay clear of this location, awful awful wings."}
{"text":"Writing this review even though it happened about 3 months ago? Feel that people should be aware of their service here...

I've been to multiple St. Louis within the GTA and all my experiences have been great...until my friends and I decided to go to this one. 

So I'm not too sure if it's because we were students from GBC and the waitresses had bad experiences with other students? But regardless, we were treated with no respect at this location. We ordered our food and once the drinks and food came, the waitresses never came back to check on us. I understand if it was busy or something and they were caught up with other customers...but we were the only ones there (other than the 3-4 men drinking at the bar). My friend asked to have a class of water, and it never came after 20 minutes so she had to ask again. After that, that same friend went to use the washroom and asked a waitress where the washroom was located. Once she walked in and the door was about to close, I could hear the waitress talking to her coworker while staring at my friend that just walked in. I am not kidding when I said this but her exact words were \"What a stingy bitch...\" Like, I'm sorry, you guys haven't checked in on us once, you took forever to bring her water, and when she simply asks where the washroom is...you decide to talk outloud about customers in such a negative way? When it was time to pay, we all didn't give any tip. We felt as if they didn't deserve it.

My friends and I haven't gone back since, which is unfortunate considering that we always went for the Tuesday deal for the wings. If anything, we can go to a different St. Louis where we can be treated nicely as paying customers."}
{"text":"Would give 0 stars if possible. Terrible service. After waiting 25 minutes to order, no one even acknowledged us, we were ignored by our server 3 times and rebuffed by another server when trying to order with her. She told us we had to wait for our own server. We watched our server ignore us 2 more times and finally gave up. Asked the hostess if we could move to a less busy section and was told no. I was done. We ended up driving to another St. Louis location."}
{"text":"Worst experience of all time at this location!!!! 

So upsetting and fusterated with the terrible management and staff, that has always stuck with me.

Me and my bf came here around 6ish for wings. We waited 9 min to be seated another 12min to take our order.  2lb of chicken wings each with the drinks. We waited a long time mind you for this order like 30+ min . Our waitress was already rude with attitude and took a while to come check on us for refills and such. We stayed an hour and a bit.

We had 9 wings left all together and asked for a container to go. She said \"oh you know we dont do that here you have to leave them, thats not allowed is this going to be a big problem\" We told her we go to all the other locations and they gladly give us containers. She proceeded to grab the wing bowl and say \"nope I have to throw them out sorrrry\" with a smirk. I dont usually care about things like this  but the way she said it was so snooty and her smirk, my bf finally went to the manager that was standing behind the bar middle aged women and asked for a take home container and she too gave us a fuss. Finally after arguing she gave us a simple fricken container and we mentioned how we will never come back.

You cant let us leave with a few wings, its more the point that they were so rude and condescending. What the heck."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend for Sunday night wings during last week's Blue Jays Game. We sat across from bar where the bartender/manager was serving us. She was not happy serving us but we tried to make it easy. My girlfriend needed more time to make drink decision which we made clear but she presented to us with more attitude. I asked for a side salad with my wings and got fries and salad which I was not mad about, I made a joke about being happy getting fries and she scoffed. My girlfriend's chicken salad was missing cheese and bartender/manager consulted the menu in front of us and to double check instead of just getting the cheese. 

She made me feel very uncomfortable and not welcoming, did not thank us for the bill even after I tipped 15 percent still. 

Other than that, the food was great. 

Calamari was just right, not too soggy and lightly crispy. 

Chippers hit the spot. Ask for southwest sauce 

Wings are great as always and buffalo chicken salad was great. Veggies were fresh and crispy and tenders were not diced but still good and saucy. Just forgot the cheese which was no big deal. 

Space was great. Other servers were nice enough to help despite it was a busy night. 

Bathrooms were clean and smelled nice which was a relief."}
{"text":"The Wings are VERY, VERY good. 
However the service is not good at all, it's well below average.
The Waitress tries to make up for her poor service by calling you \"honey\" or \"sweetie.\"

But again, I go to St. Louis for the Wings, NOT the lousy service."}
{"text":"It's VERY rare that I would write something negative about a restaurant but here is a brief description of my experience at this particular St. Louis last week:

When I sat down I was immediately greeted by a waitress who put in my order for a draft beer. Noticing she was rather busy I waited patiently for approximately 10 minutes until I got her attention asking her for my beer. She then asked me if I wanted a Larger sized one which was on sale and I replied ok.
After a few more minutes I asked again and she rudely said if I looked to my right I would notice that the bartender was having trouble pouring the beer in the glass as it had too much foam. She walked off as if I should have noticed this. It was about the rudest I've  ever been treated at any restaurant in my entire life. 
I walked out after letting her know I was leaving and noticed she hurried back to my table to take something away, what it was I have no idea. 

I've been to this place several times and will NEVER return!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this chain. 

Last time visiting this chain. 

Not good. 

Went there today, service was beyond slow, food got worse as the meal went on, and I felt queasy for a few hours afterwards. I've no intention of returning."}
{"text":"We ordered some food for takeout and when we got home we realized they messed up the order. Gave them a call and not only did they apologize and give us the proper order, they fully refunded everything and gave us a couple of free meal cards. It's refreshing to experience customer service like this. Honest mistake on their part and they have won back our business instantly."}
{"text":"I was there Sunday night with a friend, because we were both craving burgers. I had the bacon cheddar burger with a side of guac. It wasn't a bad burger; the meat itself tasted only like cooked ground beef. The guac wasn't very fresh, you can tell the avocados were way too ripe. The fries however, were to die for, especially with the dill sauce. They will charge you 0.79 for the sauce though.

What I do like about this location is the service and the atmosphere. It's a great place to catch the game, and have a beer. Our server Andrew was very friendly, and constantly checking up on us. 

If you do have a car, get ready to look for street parking (which is usually packed). 

Overall if I could give this place a three and a half stars I would, because I feel like it doesn't deserve a 3 but it's not exactly a 4 either."}
{"text":"The fries were pretty tasty and a pound for 8.99 at lunch is not a bad deal. 

My friends had the sweet spicy asian wings and were pleased. I had the hot wings. Hot they were not and they were dry as hell. I was happy that their wings are GF but the fries, which have a crispy coating are not. 

Not bad."}
{"text":"Great wings and good locations. If you're a sports fan, this is your spot!
The staff treat costumer very well and the price won't empty your pocket!"}
{"text":"I come to day for tuesday night at 10:45pm . And i come seat in table wait for get order 20 minutes. And i call 1 service. And she call the guy . And the guy come in ask for drink . And he come back inside. But Don't bring drink for us . Am feel bad for that . And i go home . Don't eat . Why we eat and get tip for them when we coming, but we cannot get service. At least they need come and tell us \" sorry we busy now , can u wait a little \" . We will happy with that when we wait ."}
{"text":"It was a Friday night at this location, and it was not busy at all. There was a total of 10 people at the restaurant and not once did the waitress come to take our order. She sat my friend and I down at like 10:30 PM and never came back. 

This place absolutely sucks"}
{"text":"Went there only because I had an excellent food & staff experience with their HWY 7 location in the past. Ordered the same thing as before, their burger, the most economical one and boy, was I disappointed!!!

Food - Oily fries; soggy, oxidized lettuce; stale bun.
Service - OK.

I think, the lettuce or fries by itself would be a BIG turn off and I had a collection of bad stuff going on that day at this location. It was very busy but still does not justify my food quality being poor. Destroyed my appetite and also my experience that day. 

I blame the cook, manager & quality control of that Sheppard location and not the restaurant itself. Try the HWY 7 location, it will be a better experience."}
{"text":"Service was good, friendly staff. Clean, including bathroom. Design was a typical bar & wings kinda look, so nothing extraordinary there. 

There were only a few customers and one server so it was a little slow and it does make sense as I went on an odd time, it was after lunch but before dinner. Weather was accommodating enough to sit outside and the experience was good, for sure. 

I was craving a big, juicy burger that day. And I ordered the burger, of course. Took longer than usual to get my food. But, holy guacamole, was it worth the wait!! It was very well prepared, very neat and well presented. The bun was soft and the burger itself was perfectly cooked. Even the french fries were delicious like crazy. I wiped my plate clean. I had a company with me who ordered the chicken tortilla. That was good too. 

I heard Wednesdays are $5 burger days and other wing days. I will visit this location again to try other things."}
{"text":"Je pense que ce soir là un des cuistots ou une des serveuses était malade car le service était trop long. A noter au les tables sont mal nettoyées.
Dommage car le poulet est très bon et l'établissement très bien placé!

I think we got unlucky because one of the cooks or waitresses was not  here that night.
We had to wait 30 minutes for a table and I have to add that they were not properly cleaned.
Too bad because the chicken wings are very good and the location of the restaurant is perfect!"}
{"text":"It's getting really expensive to frequent St. Louis.  Ordered an Angus burger.  It looks much smaller than before. I also paid an extra $2.00 for a Ceasar salad instead of fries.  This salad was so tiny.  So disappointed that you have to pay extra for less food.  All for the ballooned price of $14 + tax (not including entrees, drinks, etc...)  Not really worth it for an average burger meal.

C.L."}
{"text":"ZERO Stars!!

The first time I went I just left cause no one paid any attention to us and we waited for 10+ mins.  No one came to acknowlege us and I know they saw us waiting for a table.  Thing is it wasn't even packed.  This place is going down hill as they only had 1-2 people working and an older couple working the bars and watching tv. Might be the owners.

This is the 2nd time I went as I decided to give them another chance.  I usually like St. Louis bar  & Grill but the one in Richmond Hill I would suggest you stay away.  Worst Service Ever.  First they take 30 mins to seat you when there are 3-4 tables that are free but needs cleaning.  The old couple there seems to be the owners are terrible and cheap.  Stay away. I enjoy my time at the other locations such as the York Mills and the one across from Rogers Center.  I love their fries with the dill pickle dip. Yummy."}
{"text":"Really good wings. Most of the wait staff is friendly too but the wait to get in and for the order to come is 2-3 hrs at the minimum. Very busy and crowded all the time."}
{"text":"I'll try and keep it short. Sat at the bar to watch the Superbowl, just to drink. I already know the food at this location. (It may be fine for others...)  Ordered a $23 bottle of wine.  The bartender advised by law she can only serve me half litre at a time. (I was alone)  I said np what are you going to do its the law.  So can I order a bottle and you keep it and pour me half liter at a time?  The bartender said, she will check with the manager. Came back and said, no you would have to order another half litre.  I asked how much is a half litre?  LOL I was told $22.  I said okay I'm leaving now.  The bartender was great, this outrageous gouge has nothing to do with her. I switched it from one start to two stars, because of the great service from the bartender."}
{"text":"I come for wings, nothing else. Which by the way I have hands for so for everyone complaining about a fork go east wings at home with one. 

Top 3 wings place for sure with Duffs and Wild Buffalo Wing"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I'm here right now on cheap wing night, when you would expect the wings would be flowing. We have been here for an hour and a half YES an hour and a half and still don't have our food because the waitress screwed up our order, claiming she didn't hear us. This is why I never come here. Although it may be deduced that it's cheap night and it's unusually busy, that isn't the case this evening. There are several empty tables and post patrons have their food already. Not impressed and never coming back."}
{"text":"I love the St. Louis wings poutine. It is the best!!! Their fries make the restaurant in my opinion, they are the best fries ever (and lack in chicken wings because of this). But regardless, love the wings poutine. It is so good, I ordered a large and ate it in two different sittings because they give you so much. The waitress was incredibly sweet as well and brought out a cake for my friend who was celebrating his birthday (even though we did not ask at all for that to happen)!"}
{"text":"Came here to watch the raptors playoff and the place was busy!!! The manager told us he didn't know how long the wait would be but managed to rearrange some tables to squeeze my boyfriend and I into the booth area  We were very appreciative of that! 

We started with a lb of wings and ckn tenders.  The wings were amazing and not heavily battered.  Just simple, fresh and saucy.  We decided to get 2 rounds as they were so good.  The chicken tenders were just okay.  A bit over fried and too salty.  

The service was amazing!  I have never been to a bar where the servers were so busy, but attentive.  

Hint: they take reservation even during playoff time 

I'll definitely be coming back... In fact,  I'm going back tonight"}
{"text":"My go to place for wings, fries and beer. They have the absolute best tasting wings and fries I have ever had. My faves are cajun and hot sweet asian. Now the fries here reallly special. Im not a big fries person but here I breathe them in. They are thick cut, crunchy on the outside and soft inside. They always come with a deeeelish dill sauce. The other great dish they have is their st. Louis wings poutine. Sooooo good. They have great after 5 specials as well. Ohhh their waitresses are superrr friendly."}
{"text":"I came here to try another venue that shows UFC without cover. The place for events/parties is up stairs and is called the lounge. The food consists of the menu served downstairs. 
My buddy and I ordered two pounds of wings split between original buffalo style and suicide. The place was jam packed and we literally got the last table. Our server was very nice and even though the place was busy checked on us time to time. The wings arrived quickly and I must say these are one of the better wings I have had in TO. The suicide had a nice manageable kick to them . Buffalo style were OK but still better than one of the higher rated places I have tried. Unfortunately The beer selection is quite mundane with your usual variety of mainstream stuff. I went with a pint of Stella. The wings are mainly drummets so don't expect actual wings here. I had an appetite so I went for the Angus burger as well with an add on of sweet potato fries.  The burger was ho hum though a hefty patty cooked through all the way and was surprisingly cold.  Fries were good. 
Washrooms are upstairs and are not very clean and get slammed in between matches. 
This place is very popular apparently and does get real packed so try to come in early if its a larger group as several people were turned away while we were there. 
Verdict 3.5 stars overall due to the above average wings and no cover for UFC. 
Note. Even though they have HDTV the PPV event was shown in SD a logic that escapes me as that seems to be the norm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on a Sunday evening. Drinks (Caesars) were horrible had to send them all back. Tasted like watered down tomato juice."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Here for the raptors playoff game 5, only came back because we had coupons from our bad service the week before where they messed our order up twice and we waited forever for food. We decided to come back to use our free wing coupons and were very displeased with the service. It isn't even busy at all and we have been literally waiting over 35 minutes to even SEE our server. The people sitting next to us were also making comments about where the server was, and they were not even seen by anyone until about 15 minutes after being seated. I guess it makes sense why it's so dead at a franchise restaurant so close to the ACC and sky dome. Take your money and go up the street."}
{"text":"I came on a Tuesday night, wing night. Although service shouldn't be any different during any of the days.. I felt like it was, or at least maybe I hope it was. Servers were quite inattentive. Yes it was busy .. But our server never actually showed up and the hostess had to take our orders. Wings were also TINY. I really hope service and food is better on the other days.. even though it really shouldn't. Ive been to other St. Louis and they were all great. This one disappoints me."}
{"text":"Just came for wings and a beer. It was okay. The service was great and very friendly. 

It was fine but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Our last night in Toronto, we were lazy and wanted something tasty but close to our hotel on Lombard. We checked the reviews and saw 1/2 price wings on Tuesday so we decided to walk over. It was very busy but we were seated promptly. Our server was so friendly & attentive; she was just an absolute pleasure. Beer was cheap and the food was reasonably priced. Because of the 1/2 price wings, my huge basket of boneless wings and fries was less than $7. It was a great atmosphere where you could watch sports as well. I'm certain that we'll go back next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten at St. Louis for a proper meal in a long time, so I was tempted to get either a burger or wings. In the end I decided on Honey Garlic wings with fries and blue cheese on the side. They didn't have my favourite Blue Honey wings, so side cheese was my back-up plan. On the other hand, my friend got the steak tacos.

Food was served quickly but I have to remind myself again not to eat wings at St. Louis. It's not at all on par with other wings restaurants (eg. Wild Wings, All Star Wings). The skin wasn't cooked as crisp and saucy, and the wings weren't as meaty. However, the fries were well done and tasty.

Service was below average because after the waiter came with the credit machine, he walked away and just left it there. I had to take my customer copy as well as rip the merchant copy. Then he never came back for at least ten minutes (p.s. tried already to flag down other staff but they were too busy at the bar or talking to friends). This made my friend unsure of how to process their payment. Customers don't work the machines OK? Employees do. Unless they are fine with customers breaking their property.

Steak taco observation: although I didn't taste the taco, but it didn't look like the taco shown on the menu. The steak, according to my friend, was more like minced beef.

This St. Louis is super close to Fairview Mall, which makes it convenient. Other than that, I think it's best to avoid unless you want a quick beer at the bar. Overall, this restaurant location is more of a 2.5/5 star."}
{"text":"When staying the industrial area surrounding Toronto's Pearson airport you find yourself without many dining options for dinner. Lunch yes...but dinner? Not so much. Other than Zorro's Steakhouse, which is great but not considered casual, St Louis is one my 'go to' places for dinner.

Typical type sports bar with great cold beer selections and a full bar. Daily specials that really are specially priced and consistent good food make this one of my favorites. Wings are good and burgers are better. Even the Cob Salad was excellent.

I went recently and discovered I had chosen the same evening as the Blue Jays' Wild Card game...the inside and the patio were packed with great fans that easily made an outsider like me feel welcome. I was able to grab the corner seat at the bar and immediately was engaged by a group there for the game. I had the consistently good dinner with a little local entertainment as well."}
{"text":"I want to start out by saying my family and I REALLY want to like this place.  It's close to home, there's a game to watch and for my two teenagers the menu of bar food is perfect.  Again, I really want like this place and after about 5 visits and a few take outs, I was still on the fence.  It's been and miss but we decided to try it out one more time on Family Day.  

MISS: each entry came out at different times which meant someone was always eating alone, two meals were sent back for coming out cold and not at the same time.  We had one cold meal and we sent it back and then s different cold meal came out afterward and we had to send it back.  We likened it to the over 60 minute wait we had.  My salad had no dressing (no biggie) but it did have conglomeration of spice on the bottom of it not unlike  when the top drops off the spice shaker and you serving it anyway!  It took over an hour for everyone to finally get a warm meal that they ordered but then one of us took a bite into a plastic bread tab in their sandwich....  Well we were finished.  We gave up and abandoned our food,  the  owner took off the plastic tab meal and one order of fries.  Woo hoo.  Never again."}
{"text":"Extremely poor management. As a regular customer of St. Louis, I was quite unsatisfied with my visit at this location this evening. Bouncer at front door seemed very unorganized, and would call the seating arrangement in the wrong order. As if wait time to be seated wasn't long enough already, the time to get our wings took even longer. Apparently the kitchen was training many new hires on a busy Tuesday 1/2 price wings day. Manager was extremely rude. I get that Tuesdays here can get busy, but with the manager rushing us to finish and telling us customers that the restaurant \"loses money on Tuesdays\"? Come on now. Maybe a smile every now and then from the manager would help. Honestly, 2 stars because the wings with fries was okay, not as good as I remember it to be. I would recommend you to go to another location."}
{"text":"in a world where hockey is more popular than basketball, attempting to find a place that played the raptors game over the leafs game is a tall order. this place was no exception.... however, it was the only place near the ACC that had seats available.... so i dove in with a friend.

SERVICE
- sat at the bar, and the bartender was very attentive, not in your face, and was always delivering our beers with a smile.

FOOD
- they had an all you can eat ribs thing going on for $19.99. AYCE is always a sign that the food is just average and the clientele being sough for are folks who enjoy quantity over quality. but... i was starving. and to quite honest, they weren't too bad. not amazing, but not terrible.

AMBIANCE
- it's a sports bar. near the ACC. good vibe on game nights. not so much on a normal night.

there are better places in the city for chicken and ribs, but i'd really only go back if every other place was full.... sorry st louis."}
{"text":"Their messy veggie burger was surprisingly really good! It's got spice too if you're into that. Their thick cut fries were crispy and delicious as always. My meal came out looking sub par but the taste impressed. Apparently their chicken and waffles were pretty good - upgraded to sweet potato fries and I must say I ate a few of those too.

Server was friendly and pleasant, checked up on us a LOT which I'm not used to but also a bit overkill. Raps game 2 was on and we didn't go for another pitcher so our server brought us our bill as a signal that we should leave... So we ended up leaving at halftime."}
{"text":"The staff are amazing and even with missing on one order they handled it without hesitation by not charging for the entree. Waitresses really work hard to get the orders in a timely fashion. Emily our waitress is so cool and was awesome with the service."}
{"text":"Well, the good news is that they were playing both the Habs and the Leafs game. And that we got a table.

The bad news is just about everything else.

I ordered a strongbow, it was watery and flat (on tap). I passed it around to my friends to make sure I wasn't wrong. (Wasting alcohol is a sin you know.)

The wings weren't cheap, and the portions weren't large. They do come with \"free fries\" but there were so few it hardly seemed worth it. The almonds on the salad were rancid (but I felt too bad to send it back after sending a drink back so I just tried to picked them off), the celery that was brought to the table was soft and slimy. 

Also, the waitress was very nice, but there was only one girl working a packed Saturday night. 

I might go back for a cheap wings night... I do love my wings so, but they were overpriced and I don't think I would pay full price again."}
{"text":"We had spicy wings. They were standard- delicious wings. The place is open till late and close to our place. It is a sports bar, wasnt too crowded when we visited."}
{"text":"I'm writing to leave a glowing review for the two people who've served me here-- Jaime and Essence. Both id an amazing job, were attentive and made sure I had a great view of the screen. Also to say damn, the wing poutine, you'll feel it in the morning but it's worth it.

If I had to criticize anything I'd say that it's too dark and the servers apaently are not allowed to turn the lights up, but that's not enough to stop me from coming back for the Raptors Games!"}
{"text":"They dont even deserve one star, poor customer service, treating customers unfairly. The server didn't even say any greetings. We just ordered a beer and don't even bother ordering their food."}
{"text":"I would give zero stars. I came here with a group of 8 on a Tuesday night only to be told that we had to wait 15 minutes for a table to be cleared. By this time we had already been waiting 15 minutes. I'm sorry but it does not take 15 minutes to clear a table. I should have offered to help clear it! There were no other people waiting for tables, but the server's excuse was that they had to clear other tables. This isn't the first time I have experienced bad customer service at this location. We left and will never come back here again."}
{"text":"I probably eat here a few times per month. I come back because I do enjoy the food. Today was not typical of my past visits. I ordered 2 pounds of wings with fries. The wings were extremely small today. I know when some places get smaller wings they make it up in weight. This was not the case today. They were so small they were almost a nuisance to eat. Which I know sounds funny. Like I said I've never experienced this on past visits so maybe it was just a fluke. In addition to this issue, my waitress fell a little short today. The food arrived in an acceptable time, but once the waitress dropped it off I did not see her again. Except with her coat walking out the door about 35 minutes from when my food was dropped off. I did require a drink refill. By the time another waitress got to me I figured I'd just leave, so I asked for my bill. The waitresses name on the bill said Chelsea, but I'm not sure if she was the one who gave me (I don't want to call it bad service) but it was actually no service at all. If it was her, she was a short brunette. The girl who cashed me out was a blonde. She was pleasant.  I'm not one to complain. I'm only writing this review in hopes my experience is not repeated. I did still tip her 20% and I also contributed to an autism fundraiser they are doing."}
{"text":"Came Here for a quick bite on my birthday. And the whole place sang me happy birthday!! 

Other than that, the staff were friendly and greeted us and seated us quickly even on a busy evening. 

The food is standard pub food, but delicious."}
{"text":"Was just at St. Louis in North Oshawa location and left after waiting for 20 minuets without being served (much less talked to).  Drove over to this location and instantly noticed a few things.

1. This locations interior & exterior appearance is really nice.  Well kept exterior and very bright interior so you can actually see things.  Clean and orderly.  I'm impressed already.

2. Was instantly greeted by Brittney who let us know we could sit where we wanted and a server would be with us shortly.

3. Within 2 minutes, Sydney popped over and took our order and within another 3, we had our drinks in hand.  (NORTH OSHAWA LOCATION TAKE NOTE - this is called basic customer service!!!!)

On to the food.  I would have added a pic but I was hungry and I ate too fast... which lead to a second order and I ate that also.  Food was definately hot.  Fries were were really good and crispy and tasted awesome with the little dip it came with.

The ribs were tender and perfectly glazed.

My only complaint was the coleslaw... I would recommend skipping it but that is a personal choice.  Not as creamy as I usually like it.  But really in the grand scheme of things, it was a non-issue.

Definately recommend this specific location.  Food was good and service was as it should be."}
{"text":"Came here last week on St. Paddy's Day and I am still dreaming about the St. Louis poutine. It was amazing. My coworker first introduced it to me, fries, gravy, cheese curds, creamy dill sauce and boneless chicken pieces topped with hot sauce. Yum.

If you're anything like me and you love poutine - this would sound off to you. What ever happened to just regular poutine. But OMG, how amazing. If you haven't already tried it. Get it. 

For a busy night, our server was great. She refilled our drinks, the service was quick, and she stopped to ask us if we needed anything a few times. Would I come back? Yes. Would I come back for the poutine? Hell yes!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a weekday. Service was good but the lunch special cheeseburger was over cooked and basically just a grilled frozen patty and not as good as your average fast food burger. Companion had the black bean tacos which were basically just a vegetarian bean burger patty cut up and served in a couple tortillas. Arrived at the table cold. Overall very disappointed. Based on previous reviews should have stuck to the wings. Second time I've visited a St. Louis franchise and disappointed both times. On a positive note, the service was good, food was not."}
{"text":"Great place to go for watching sports.  Lots of TVs available.  But it gets a bit crowded and they try to send you upstairs but it's a different store altogether even though probably same owner operating under a different name.

Stay downstairs if possible."}
{"text":"The January special turned out not to be so special.  It turned out me and couple other friends picked the wrong date to frequent St Louis.  In conjunction with the all you can eat options, the wings were half price.  The end result, a wait of one hour and fifteen minutes.  I think if one of us were not craving for St. Louis so much, we would have gone to another place.  We all ordered the all you eat options, but I could only eat two rounds before I was wait over my limit.  The food was so so, but the atmosphere was quite good in here with good service from the server.  Not bad overall."}
{"text":"I went here for Dinner today, well for our Friday night party.  I really love the Atrium Building, with so many choices of restaurants, like pikel barrel, spring rolls, red lobster, etc. I have gone to all of them so far, except this one, which I did today.  The experience was great! The ribs we ordered were so fine, with that fine smooth ice cold beer!! What else can you ask for on a Friday?  Also, I love being in the middle of so many hockey fans."}
{"text":"St. Louis is a classic bar. It has daily deals which are affordable and pretty good. Nothing Amazing about it or horrible. It's solid and conveniently located."}
{"text":"Tuesday specials ! Half price chicken wings 6.99 1lb with a purchase of a drink!!

Came here on a tuesday and it was packed around 7pm - 15mins waiting period.

The service was quick and very helpful!

The  chicken wings was definetly worth $7 .. Tasted amazing wasn't hard at all... The meat was soft and juicy and had lots of flavor!!not to mention .. There are 9 of those yummy wings and they are not small.... oh !! And I absolutely loved the fries and now they have become my favorite fries ..."}
{"text":"Ordered a to go bacon burg w cheese and Asian salad. Was quick as we rolled into town and were hungry. Took food back to where we were staying and everything was great. Burger was great ! A tiny mix up on the condiments but just didn't  get my pickle on the side but no big deal. Was surprised to get fries but as I said o quickly ordered. Asian sales was very good. Could have used  some more Mandarin oranges and crunchy noodles match the menu pic but no worries here. Had a tall boy while I waited and it was cold! Price was right, good hot, beer cold. Excellent!
I would try this place again!"}
{"text":"Came here for my guy friend and I's monthly ritual of wings and beer visit. lol.

We are always on the lookout for new places to try and this is not a fancy place, just your typical sports bar. We found seats by the bar so we could chat up the bartenders and watch the game on the TV's. 

Beer goes down smooth, and the wings were good. I didn't have anything special in particular to say about this place.

The staff is friendly and were chatty enough as it did get busy as the night went on. 

I would come here again."}
{"text":"Full disclosure, I'm not the biggest wing fan. I arrived here on a Monday night with 12 people after work. The restaurant is located in the middle of condo land downtown. The place looked like most other St. Louis locations. It was dead - only one other table in the restaurant. 

They have a daily special, tonight it was a pound of wings, fries and a mini- pitcher of beer for about $15 - $16 if I remember correctly. 

Here's the good:

- Service was great. It did get busier later in the evening when the football game started and service remained excellent despite our large group size.
- My friends who like wings, enjoyed their wing choices. The wings were large with lot's of meat on the bone. Lot's of varieties to choose from.

And the not so good:

- Limited beer selection - I went with a ShockTop
- I had the chicken sandwich. The chicken is basically a boneless wing but I don't think there was nearly enough chicken for the size of the sandwich. 
- Fries were just average in my opinion.

I don't consider my experience worthy of three stars but I realize it's a little unfair to rate a wing place poorly since I'm not particularly fond of wings. Three stars since my friends enjoyed the wings."}
{"text":"The wings are pretty good. This location is so quiet during the winter since it has limited space without the patio."}
{"text":"Seriously, Don't waste your money!!!! EPIC FAIL!

ordered through just-eats.ca. 2 orders of tavern fish & chips. 2 small pieces of fish (5 inches by 2.5 inches), 1 tiniest portion of fries. (and I do mean tiny). NO tartar sauce.  Very Small portion of coleslaw.  Cost total $32.00 includes delivery charges of $4 bucks.

Order Time: 6:55
Ready Time: 7:15
Delivery Time: 8:02

FOOD STONE COLD!  EPIC FAIL. BLAND! and exceptionally small for $12.00+Tax"}
{"text":"This St. Louis is amazing. It has great service, consistent food quality and the same atmosphere everytime you go! Highly recommended if you're in the area and want some staple wings"}
{"text":"St. Louis isn't pretending to be anything other than what it is; a generic franchise-based beer and burger joint. So, I went in for a beer and burger by the sunny patio, ended up with a beer and chicken-topped poutine by a sunny patio and left content. If I had really needed a clean glass with my beer I would have been disappointed. If I had really needed Manchester United playing on 4 large screen TVs. I would have been thrilled.

As it was, it was ok. Service was pleasant, poutine was good (but not good for you), and the sun was splendid."}
{"text":"I went here recently because a friend wanted to watching skating (I know...) and the only place I could think of in the area that might play this was this specific st. Louis!  After all they play a lot of sports and isn't skating a sport??

Well turns out that it was the wrong day for skating but a great day to find a neat little gem in this area.

I'm going to agree with some of the other reviewers on food.  The wings are wings.  Everyone has their preference on the type of wings they like but my preferences favour st. Louis wings in terms of meatiness (I don't think they are scrawny or too meaty (no growth hormones or turkey wings for me thank you).

This time I had the rib and wing platter and a couple pints of keiths.  The food was alright and hit the spot.  I am an addict for their sauce...it's normally served with the fries but I literally dip everything edible into it.  

What made this visit a good one and made me a fan and probable repeat customer was the owner, jimmy!  On entering it just happened that he was the person we flagged down.  With the other sports activities on, we didn't want to take a tv that someone else might want to watch (and I was embarrassed I won't lie).  Jimmy was awesome...he got us in an area where we could watch a specific tv, and because it was a relatively empty space he gave us freedom to pick the perfect viewing seats.  He even gave us the tv remote to find the skating (we settled on football once my friend realized she had the wrong date).  In staying there it was interesting to see Jimmy engage all the patrons as he did his rounds.

I think my only real complaint was that it did seem either understaffed or because we were in a separate space they didn't frequent us as much to check in on us (the staff I mean).

I often forget that even these franchises have owners who are working to make a living and make something of themselves.  I am a firm believer that it is these entrepreneurs that will bring us put of a recessionary time period and was definitely proud and happy to see the owner so engaged on a Friday night, supporting his staff and appreciating his customers.  

While st. Louis has the standard menu and decor, this time around the people really made the difference.

Will I be returning again, and soon?  A definite yes, thanks to jimmy."}
{"text":"My favorite wing place!!! Hot and honey are awesome but my new flavor is Cajun dust."}
{"text":"Good and service was great. We ordered fries, sweet potato fries and fish tacos. We are from America and enjoyed our time here."}
{"text":"A fairly new location. Very spacious. Lots of TVs and a large bar area. They have a patio as well and lots of parking.

I have a weakness for deep fried pickles, so I had to have them. Light, crispy batter and the dill sauce is the best ever. Portion could've been bigger tho. Was there for half price wings and they were great! Love their wing sauce selection. Beer selection could use some work tho, only the usual suspects, no craft beer there yet.

Service was great! Food arrived hot and fresh and our drinks were kept full."}
{"text":"St Louis's is a classic chain. One thing I love about then is there patios!! Nothing better than enjoying a cold drink and nachos or wings ( wing deal is the best!) on the patio. It gets busy on game nights so it can be a wait to get a seat but they're good about letting you know when you get A spot. I like how they have daily specials for food items,that s a nice touch."}
{"text":"Not wonderful service and kinda meh wings and ribs. We came here last week. I got the ribs and wings special and my girlfriend got the lb of wings. Service was very slow and the food was not wonderful."}
{"text":"Good wings,  horrendous service...  Make sure you don't go when it's busy.  Servers can't keep up.."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and so far I have not really seen the service issues that others have said.  Service is ok...I'm not expecting the world at a bar establishment.  I want my wings, I want my beer.  I got both.

The staff was actually pretty helpful.  I needed my phone charged and they were courteous enough to a) check if anyone had a charger and on realizing I had one but no nearby outlet b) they kept it behind the bar until I was done.  Well played...well played.

Wings have gotten smaller and harder so food wasn't great but discovered their sliders are actually very good!!!

Hopefully all of this means that they have or are getting better...good luck st. Louis!!!"}
{"text":"St. Louis Bar and Grill has replaced its signature fries with a side order of sexual objectification. I was appalled when I saw their new menu and left without ordering.

- Slogans such as \"Mild? Does your mom know you wear panties?\" are not acceptable. It is not OK to equate \"playing it safe\" to being female. 

- Phrases like \"Sorry. Wait staff are not available for take-out\" is not OK. Wait staff are PEOPLE and should not be equated with items on the menu. 

- Describing your sauces as being \"saucier than your teenage daughter\" is not OK. It is not appropriate to sexualize young females and minors."}
{"text":"Food 3 stars
Service 4 stars

This location is close to our place. It's only 5-10 mins walk. I used to eat chicken wings at St.Louise often though it wasn't this location. I actually didn't like the service here back then. So I was very surprised when I found that good service existed here! 

Our server was nice and friendly. He was such a good salesperson. Every time he talked, he always smiled. He told us that they have a karaoke night every Wednesday till 2 am. He said it was the best and most fun karaoke he's ever been to. ^_^ I don't know if it's true or not. If I go there again, it's because of him lol. Oh! I will go with my husband too :) 

Specials*
- half price chicken wings every Tuesday"}
{"text":"This place is hard to see if u just pull into the parking lot and not see it from hwy 7, but it's there and it faces hwy7. It's not a bad spot if ur from out of town and staying at the near by hotel, it's walking distance, it's a bar, it's got wings and killer dipping sauce, and fries u will remember, but if ur from Toronto/ Markham or what ever then u know its just franchised bar, not bad but not great! Prices are OK (20$ a pitcher)"}
{"text":"this location is on 16th and its a little hidden i guess, i never find it get super busy, and its got a patio, but the problem is, its just a st. Louis its wings are not the best, and even tho the beer is cold and not super expensive, some thing about the st louis atmosphere is a huge turn off for me. if your in the area and looking for wings go down to all star wings are 16th and woodbine."}
{"text":"We tried this place 10 years after trying the St Louis in Vaughan where I decided that it was one of the worst restaurants to eat at ever.  Another American chain that serves their style of fatty, fried, greasy garbage food that leaves them all the way they are (Denny's, IHOP, McDonald's, Applebee's, TGIFridays, Boston Pizza on and on and on).  Why? Because it was close to home and didn't want to drive to Newmarket.

To say that after eating this \"food\" you leave here feeling unhealthy is an understatement.  Everything came with a crapload of fries. Yes I could've substituted with a salad but it was extra. What a crock of sh*t. In this day and age you shouldn't have to pay extra for healthier alternatives. The Angus burger was dry and had a slightly disgusting meat taste.  By the way, when you see 100% Angus meat - it doesn't mean what it used to mean.  20 years ago you could buy an Angus meat steak or burger meat and it was the juiciest thing you ever tasted. But when you start seeing it at McDonalds and Walmart you just know the value of the brand has face planted, and then you get served a \"burger\" like this - Angus no longer has any meaning to me as a customer.  Same as \"Triple A\" meat - whatever that meant - probably Antibiotics, Anabolic Steroids and Avoid At All Costs.

BUT the wings were friggin delicious which was a surprise because of the Vaughan restaurant where EVERYTHING sucked.

The flatbread bruschetta appetizer was also really good and worth every penny. 

ALSO the waitresses there were VERY attentive and VERY polite.  I would go back just for those 3 things.  Our waitress Steph was one of the most attentive and accommodating waitress I've ever had!  Thank you

Price was too much for fried foods. Period. Anybody can open a restaurant with a deep fryer."}
{"text":"This was the designated hang-out for Superbowl Sunday this year. A great location on Queen St. in the Beaches. The service was pretty quick considering they were pretty packed in there for the big game. 
Menu has all the regular bar stuff: burgers, nachos, chicken fingers, and of course, wings. 
I asked if the poutine was made with real curds or not and the waitress said yes! So I ordered it. When i came it wasn't made with curds at all. But before i even said anything, the waitress noticed and said \"oh! I'll take this back and get them to change it for you!\" Which i thought was great :) Sure it took a little longer to get my food, but when it came, it was delish! Really yummy gravy! 
I'm not big on chicken wings, but i tried one from my friend's plate and it was good! Not the saucy kind, but nice and crispy. Another friend got the 4 cheese dip. Oh man! I loooove cheese and this was ooey gooey goodness in a bowl. 
For the sports fan, there were lots o' tvs everywhere! Everyone in there had a great view of the game."}
{"text":"Where do i even start? Took 10 minutes to get a menu; server forgot to bring kids menus; washrooms were a disaster; kids' meals same size as adult. We ordered chocolate milk with each of our kid's $6.99 meal; when bill came we were charged $3 for each milk, even though the menu clearly states that drinks are included. After pointing out the error our server proceeded to argue with us. She eventually fixed HER mistake. Oh and the food was terrible."}
{"text":"This location is casual with a high noise level. Now that it is patio session, the outdoor seating area definitely fills up quickly. I've been to many of the franchise but I feel that this location is a tad disorganized and I find it really difficult to get any server to come to your table. Interior is decently clean but a little crowded. I ordered the special platter where you can get boneless chicken and 10 wings with sweet potato fries. The boneless chicken were very dry that I had no choice but to order a ginger ale to wash it down. It took a good 5 minutes to get a server then the first waitress forgot so we had to call over another server who got it after 3 minutes when we were seated pretty much next to the bar. She brought the ginger ale with white things floating in them so we had to call for another server who came quickly and exchanged it quite rapidly. Unfortunately, by the time we finally got a drinkable ginger ale I pretty much finished my meal. I most likely won't recommend this location to a friend."}
{"text":"Among the worst wings I've eaten. I always get the 'Hotter Than Hell', which I can assure you ARE NOT (please read other reviews of mine to understand what HOT really means to me as I am a masochist for heat). No matter what flavour you get, the wings all seem to have this fake smoke taste that I find very offputting.

I'm a purist and grew up across the border from Buffalo, so I've learned to love the original Bufffalo wings with Blue Cheese dip. But whenever I order extra sauce, they default to the Dill sauce. Dill sauce with wings?? I guess some people like it, but it seems like a bit of a crime that your go-to chicken wing sauce is dill.

Not for me."}
{"text":"Really good service. Friendly staff and very detail oriented. We ordered pitchers and wings. The waitress took her time to refill our glasses herself when she saw we running low. The wings were awesome but I found them to be smaller than I would've liked to them to be but then again I'm a pig (oink oink). It's a pretty small establishment but a great place to come to none the less."}
{"text":"Just wanted to write something short.  Tuesdays is like \"all hell breaks loose\", if you are planning to come here - be prepared to WAIT.  Anyhow we only waited 10-15 minutes but that's arriving before 7pm for a party of 2.  The place is honestly not fit for all those people waiting in line but I gotta give the waitresses a thumbs up for doing their best.  I wasn't happy because of how tight seating was and hated it when everyone's bums were scraping along the edges of our tables as we ate.  I guess it is something we need to accept as guests since Tuesdays are half-priced wings.  I'd probably go to another location (Richmond Hill) so that I get my own little bubble space but I want to say their staff are friendly and service was great.  I probably wouldn't come back when it's busy though."}
{"text":"Wings were great. The atmosphere was beautiful. We went around 5 pm on a Wed so not so crowded. But we loved it!"}
{"text":"This was a solid stop for late night bar food and drinks. The food was your typical chain restaurant fare, and the draft cider was just what I wanted. Lots of TVs to watch sports, friendly wait staff, and decent prices. It's nothing special, but you could do a lot worse if you're looking for a sports bar."}
{"text":"First time here today for their tuesday special wings! The place was packed! The wings were a bit small but nevertheless, good spot to mingle and socialize over drinks. They have plenty of small Tvs for the games. I came here and waited 5 mins for a spot, not bad considering it was a tuesday. Would definately come here again. On Thursdays there are appetizer specials (half price). The cauliflower  calamari bites looks good, will try next time!"}
{"text":"Went one tuesday evening for the wing special. Didnt have to wait. Wings were good but service was subpar. Took a while to get the servers attention when we wanted to get a refill or the bill."}
{"text":"Man, I love me some St. Louis wings, but this location was bad! Came by for half-price wings on a Tuesday, but that was probably the best part of the night. 

As to be expected, the restaurant was super busy for a Tuesday night, so I knew that we'd have to wait for a table. We had about 10 people, so the wait was going to be quite long until the hostess offered to split us up. We were discussing this option when the hostess abruptly and rudely asked us what our decision would be, and that she needed to know right away! I understand that you if we decide against this, you would give the table to others, but there really is NO reason you need to rush us while we were deciding without giving us much time. 

When we decided to go ahead with the split, I asked the hostess where we were going, where she rudely replied with 'Give me a minute!'  She ended up forgetting to direct us to our table, and we ended up seating ourselves... 

Our server eventually showed up and gave us menus, but didn't come back to take our orders for 5+ min. She rarely came back to check on our table, and we even had to ask other servers for refills on our drinks. At the end of the night, she accidentally typed in the wrong bill for someone on the machine, and expected us to pay out the difference/figure it out ourselves. Not my problem if you're incompetent and can't figure out what numbers are on a bill...

The wings were as good as they always are (which helped it get it's 2 stars), but the service here was not even half as good as the Markham location. This restaurant may be bigger with more tables, but you'll get a bitchy hostess that hates her job, and a server without brains. Heed my advice and go to the Markham location!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Have eaten here many times and each time its great!

Came on a Sunday, which is pretty routine for me. No wait time, and service was super quick! Server brought up an option to bread the wings on top of the sauce/flavour! Didn't know about this, and didn't cost anything extra! If you're hungry, definitely worth getting your wings breaded!

Never needed to ask for a refill on my drink, and server checked up on the table enough without being a nuisance."}
{"text":"Came here for the Raptors game 6 playoff game so of course the place was busy but we did manage to snag a booth table for 6.

Food was good but average and what you'd expect from any other St. Louis or typical chain bar/grill.

They did seem to be understaffed though with two waitresses for probably over 10 tables so it took a whole to order but food did come out in a timely manner.

It's an average place, it's not meant to wow you in any way, not a bad place to hang out though."}
{"text":"Delicious wings for 1/2 price on Tuesdays! Better than a lot of wing places I've been to. I go about once every month. Friendly staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Their wifi password says it all - best wings. Food comes out relatively quick even when it's a busy night. I also enjoy Megan's service, she's very attentive and just overall super lovely."}
{"text":"Taking orders or closed for renovations! Put an order in online with a colleague for our lunch and we paid online with her credit card. She went to pick up our lunch and found that they were under renovations and not taking orders. Not acceptable at all."}
{"text":"Ok so I think it's fine to cross St. Louis off the list of places to eat all together. Got a take out sandwich today after getting messed around at the Newmarket location only to get back to the office to find the chicken in my chicken dill sandwich/ burger to be undercooked and slimy."}
{"text":"Hair in my wings to start...was part of a larger work group and tried to discreetly show it to the waiter. 

He made a good effort, so applaud him...yet kitchen was unbearably slow, service disorganized, and wings were missing flavour, sauce and fairly thin. 

Can't think of a reason to return."}
{"text":"Worst service if you don't order alcohol. The waitress is slow and avoiding eye contact. They only care about groups of guys ordering couple rounds of beer."}
{"text":"Grabbed some dinner tonight with the besties and it was a good night.

We had the friendliest and most amazing server Eugene who tried his absolute very hardest to get my daughter to talk to him lol...she was acting really shy unfortunately.  She was still too shy even when he brought her a little sundae.  Sorry Eugene! Lol 

Now the food...everything was just delicious!  The wings were juicy and I got the hot sweet Asian flavour and it was sooooo good!!  The amount of spice and sweetness was such a good balance and that's the flavour combination I like in a sauce.  Let's not forget their famous garlic dull sauce...*drool* lol 

The only downfall I would say was the Grilled Chicken Tostada Salad.  Now it was a good salad, but I think it would have been a lot better if they used either head lettuce or romain lettuce.  It was spring mix lettuce which gave it an off taste for this specific type of salad...just my opinion anyway.  All in all, the dill pickle appetizer and even the fries were cooked to a nice crispness.

I underestimated this place and I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"All hail the return of fantastic customer service. *3.5 stars

Not so long ago, I had a hard ban on a single St Louis location and then extended it to the chain after terrible visit at a second location, however, desperate times call for desperate measures: when my first though eighth venues for UFC 129 viewing fell through, I found myself breaking my own rules at the Danforth location.

The bar was much nicer than the other franchise locations: good use of a small space and plenty of big, bright  TVs.

The staff, including the manager, were on their game even though the place was packed. From never letting a beer glass empty, to actually pouring our beer because we were \"busy watching the fight\", I was astounded.

To be fair, because it was a big UFC event, I'm sure that the bar had their A-staff working and there was definitely some hired scenery as well, so I can't guarantee that the next visit will be the same.

Food and beverage selection was solid as well. 10'ish beers on tap, though slightly expensive, and a big menu with really tasty wings (smoked BBQ heat).

On the note of expensive beer, after responding to the manager that we switched from brand A to brand B because A was overpriced, he invited us back this week for some freebies courtesy of brand A's sales rep. I know that doesn't fix the problem, but it certainly has me thinking that I should be a regular customer. 

Well-played St Louis."}
{"text":"This is a great place to take the kids after school for a munch! The staff and menu are quite kid friendly.  
We always enjoy our time here."}
{"text":"I am completely appalled at their GARBAGE service. This women (I'm assuming she's one of the owners because she was wearing causal clothing, said the waiter that originally served us is new, and spoked down on my friends and I) she really came at my friends and I and tried to get me to buy an additionally drink bc of a \"policy\" that states that if I eat two pounds of wings to share then I need two drinks in order to get the half off. Which would be fine if she didn't get all worked up, giving us attitude and pushy. we are just trying to understand what's going on and she's getting all bitchy like your store isn't busy right now. Try to have some patience with your costumers ????? You're in the god damn service industry. Tell me how that if I was like okay yah two pounds for me, buying one drink will be okay. My friend got two pounds and that's okay? Like what kinda of policy..... and even if there was then just have some patience and explain to me without basically shouting some like Policy policy NEW POLICY. U HAVE TO GET A DRINK..... then my friend spoke up like \"they also ordered a poutine\" and she's like OH OKAY. so you prove that you got all worked up bc I only got half price two pounds for two people then you make less money right? Lmfao."}
{"text":"Well if you have time to chat with people who's just sipping beer at the bar, you probably have time to take the order. I mean you could find 30 seconds in 30 minutes, right? That's how long we've been waiting."}
{"text":"Super long wait (40+ min). The waitress told us to wait outside and said she'd text us when our table was ready. We came back within two minutes after her text, but we were told to wait another 15 min because they ran out of seats to give us. Why text if table wasn't ready? It was obvious our table was given away. We waited another 15, but the waitress , AGAIN, told us to wait another 15. And she told us to wait somewhere else. It was super cold out and we'd already waited for almost an hour in total, so we just left. It's ridiculous how we were told to wait outside again when they screwed up repeatedly. Very unpleasant experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy. Food wasn't bad and staffs were courteous. The price is little steep but considering the area, it isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Review is based on trying the wing special on a Tuesday (with drink purchase). You probably won't see this place off the road as the sign is very low, directly over the door.

I sat at the bar, and the bartender was really funny and social in spite of the place being busy. I heard about the half price special, so that was my obvious choice. There's quite a number of flavours to choose from, and I went with something called 'Asian heat' (or something like that). 

The wings are served automatically with fries, dip and veggies. Even if they weren't on sale, it's already good value - but half price is GREAT value.

I wasn't floored by the wings, but they did about everything right and managed to have the crisp on the skin without overcooking them. I may try another sauce, as these ones were a little too sweet and not as spicy as I'd hope. The fries are about as good can get without being fresh cut. They remind me of Red Robbins fries from out West.

Usually this is the part where I say that I'll try other things on the menu. In this case, that might happen, but it's also possible that I'll simply make a point of coming for the wing special on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to like it here.  But I needed some emergency chicken wings and beer recently, and I was very pleasantly surprised.  The wings were great.  The fries were also really great.  I don't think I'll be a regular and any St.Louis location, but I wouldn't hesitate to come again."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this St. Louis location since it's so close to my house, but it's just not going to happen. While the service was great in terms of the employees, the speed of service was seriously lacking. 

I came in on a Friday evening at about 7pm and there were only 2 waitresses working the floor. The place was considerably full. The tables in the back were all full and there were only a couple tables in the front and a couple of seats at the bar that were empty. The waitresses that were on duty were very friendly and very helpful, but all their efforts weren't enough to keep up with a full restaurant.

Just to give you an idea of wait times, my friend and I were seated at a table 4 steps from the bar where they grab our drinks. We waited about 10 minutes for our glasses of water to be delivered to our table (at one point, I was just tempted to get it myself because I was so thirsty). Our app took 20 minutes to get delivered and our wings and fries (don't think it takes that long to cook wings and fries) were delivered another 20 minutes after that. The food was mediocre. The wings that I had at the City Place location were much juicier. These ones were pretty dry. 

As much as I'd love to score this place solely on customer service, I just can't. The servers were super friendly and they were doing everything that they could to help everyone out, but I think they were just very understaffed on the floor and in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Saw all these \"St. Louis\" places around while being in Toronto, and was finally taken to one to see what it is all about. It is your typical chain style, bar food type of place. This location I came to was actually pretty cramped inside. The tables were close together, with not much elbow room. I will say that this place is good to catch the game, as they have enough tv's, even outside on the deck, that are viewable.

The food was sub-par, compared to your typical place that serves burgers and fries, just with a bit more selection in wings, and beer. The service on the day I was there was pretty good for a full house, they were attentive, especially to empty glasses sitting at our table, asking if we wanted more water, or beer."}
{"text":"Here watching Raptors game with 7 friends on a Friday night.

Specials tonight include $19.99 Wing and Rib combo at a whopping 1620 calories plus a $5.99 Devil's Sized Pint very game night (23 ounce Coors or Canadian for another 200 calories).

The place was very busy and noisy but I finally flagged down our server and settled in for the action on several TV screens.

The meal was delicious! No cutlery...had to get up and ask another server.  Service was extremely slow and the table wasn't cleared of our plates or glasses after our meal...not good!  We asked 3  different servers to clear our table over a 30 minute period...and finally...a partial clearing!

What began as a 4 star rating dropped to a 1 star experience when all was done."}
{"text":"Tuesday is half-priced wings day; winged and boneless available.  Paired with $4.89 for a 20 ounce domestic or premium draught beer and let the great Coors Banquet times begin!  Our server Rachel provided super quick service for our drinks followed by 2 pounds wings; 1 pound Cajun and 1 Sweet Asian BBQ.  My 6 friends are also having a great time!"}
{"text":"First of all, their spicy wings are ACTUALLY SPICY. 

I ordered a pound of \"Sweet Asian Heat\", which is also the name of my upcoming 2013 calendar (No, not really.) I also asked for a side of the spiciest sauce they had. The Sweet Asian Heat was pretty good, but the hot sauce was out of control. I dipped half of my wings in there and could take no more after that. I was impressed. It still managed to be super tasty, not just spicy.

The wings were cooked just right and quite good. The service was really great, friendly and efficient, even though she was the only one on the floor. If this place had a darker, pubbier atmosphere, it'd have been perfect.

Oh, and the spicy caesar I got... top notch."}
{"text":"I came here for a quick bite with my coworker. 

It was half price appetizers day, so we got the deep fried pickles, which we demolished in seconds. They were fantastic. We each got wings and a salad. I ordered suicide (sauce on the side for optimal crunch). It was pretty spicy, but not insanely so. Let's just say, I'm still alive. The wings themselves were crispy but a bit on the overcooked side, so they were a bit dry, and smaller than I hoped for. 

Service was pleasant and they have a patio overlooking the parking lot out front."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why all the St. Louis have low ratings, I will admit they're not the best wings in the city but they're absolutely serviceable and above par. I came to this location late on a Sunday night prior to going for a late Sunday movie at Colossus. There were a bunch of open tables so it wasn't difficult to get a seat for two people. We've been here a bunch of times - we knew what we wanted so it was easy to order as well. One order of honey garlic wings and one order of lemon pepper wings (my first time trying lemon pepper after watching the Vice short about this flavor). I knew it wouldn't be as good as the documentary said it would, I need to find the best ones in Toronto but I have nothing to compare them to; these were still good.
 
The server forgot to give us dill sauce, but it was no issue as we let her know and she came around with two extra packs. The best part of St. Louis has to be their fries. This is a Canadian staple now, it's here to stay; I understand all the reviews for and against but people need to at least give this place a chance."}
{"text":"Good local beer, great poutine, worst service ever! Ran out of beer 3/4 through my spicy poutine. Sat for 10-15 minutes before the bartender's backup asked me if I needed anything. Only TWO of us at the bar! I asked for the check, left a crappy tip, and walked out. Will NEVER go back. Service is everything. The owners need to overhaul the crew."}
{"text":"I've been to st.louis many, many times and I can honestly it doesn't get worse than this. The wings are dry like bricks and hard to swallow, most likely because they were prepared wayyyy in advance and just heated up to serve. The fries also were not crispy and are stale. The \"Ice tea\" is just Brisk with extra water. This location is TERRIBLE do NOT visit."}
{"text":"Great service, food came quick and was fair"}
{"text":"I've done take-outs and I've done dine-ins.  The wings are usually on the dry side, maybe I caught them on their off days but off days have certainly been happening too often.  Ribs are okay.  For a restaurant that specializes in wings and ribs, they need to do better."}
{"text":"My absolutely favourite place for beer and chicken wings. The best French fries I've even tried. Wings are exceptional. I also love their summer patio, it's the biggest in Yonge and Eglinton area. Always great service. Be sure to come early because there is always a line in summer to sit the patio. They have everyday some special. I like Tuesday when wings are half price!"}
{"text":"I keep having less-than-stellar experiences at St Louis, yet I found myself walking into this location with a friend for lunch the other day. Some things don't change. You've been to one St Louis, you've basically been to all. 

First off, one of the most frustrating things about this location is that their soft drinks are horrendous. My diet coke tasted like chemical-flavoured water, and my friends regular coke didn't taste much better. The few times I've been here I've had the exact same experience with the drinks, so this isn't an isolated case. II think in an attempt to save money they dilute the hell out of their drinks. When all else fails at a resto, usually you can expect them to get a soft drink right! This isn't a good way to start off a meal. If they can't get the drinks right, I could only imagine what goes on in the kitchen!

Anyways, the food we got was fine. We both happened to get chicken salads. Both were pretty much what you'd expect for a $9 salad. What I found kind of annoying though was that they had run out of chicken breast. Seriously?? A place that specializes in chicken runs out of chicken?? Come on now! Anyways, they gave us the fried chicken instead, which was disappointing because the chicken itself was so thin, but was coated in half an inch of breading on each side. Gimme my protein!!

Anyways, they have some decent lunch specials, which is probably why I've returned here. Their fries really are good, wings are meh (try Crown and Dragon for good wings!). 

I think \"Meh\" sums up my experience(s) at St Louis pretty well."}
{"text":"Regular at this location of St. Louis (since I'm local) and it's extremely on-off. One day you can come in and get stellar service from the waitress/bartender and quick food, and the next you can get super-lousy wait times. missed drink orders, and sub-par food.

Tuesday nights and any major sports game-night/UFC night will always be crowded, so come early if you want a seat and decent service. Their service during busy times is extremely poor - they need to pick up the slack in order not to get so many negative reviews.

The chicken is usually cooked fine (I always get Cajun), I've only had one incident out of 2 years dining there where it was undercooked. The fries are varied - they can either be fresh and delicious or cold and soggy (if you want better-quality fries, go on Thursday and order a half-price Poutine). The sweet potato fries are amazing - they make them to order versus their regular fries and are always guaranteed delicious. The ribs there are inconsistent as well, but their burgers and salads are alright. 

Overall: consistency is not great and service can fall off quite hard, but for a solid wings + fries experience this is a decent choice."}
{"text":"Food was burnt (wings are not difficult) and the fires were cold. Had to ask the server a couple times for ketchup and more drinks. It was a Tuesday which is there busy day (half price wings) but would recommend the location at the atrium on Bay."}
{"text":"Thank You Ladies for the great service!!
I spilled my Ceasar which the glass broke with it!  Thanks for cleaning up so promptly and providing a 2nd round on the house.  When we ordered our fries we got a fresh new bottle of Mustard (awesome... But would have been nice if the wrapper was removed prior - a total no biggie really, just made me LOL.)"}
{"text":"Location: 313 Bremner Boulevard Toronto ON M5V 3V3
Price: $$$
Service: Blah

A lot of people told me St' Louis has amazing wings and their fries were the bomb... Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to it's name. Everything was over priced! A normal sized pitcher of Canadian was $22-it's not even imported beer... Like why?!

Their wings were missing something I feel... It wasn't breaded and maybe that was the reason. The wing sauce was alright nothing amazing, 1lb of wing was 12.99 (comes w/fries). That's even more expensive on a good day at Hoops, Wild Wing, Duffs, and All Star. However, I do recommend their plater of appetizers (deep fried pickles, wings, onion ring, potato chips w/herbs). I also got to admit their fries were pretty good!

Our waitress rarely checked up on us. Or at least when we need service the waitress wasn't there. 

Verdict: not my fav wing place"}
{"text":"Warning, these guys get PACKED during a hockey game.

We came here to watch UFC, and came near the tail end of a hockey game. We had to wait until the hockey people cleared out to get a table. Even the bar area was packed.

Wings here are great and come with fries. I ordered the dry cajun spice and was VERY happy with them. 

All in all, it's a friendly, comfortable place to hang out with good wings. They're on par with most wing places in the city.

Note: it's pretty small, so go early if you've got a group."}
{"text":"The ppl there r awesome except this one guy named Cole at first I thought he was cool but then I called like 2-3 different times an all those times he hung up on me which totally proves he's a piece of crap an I honestly do like it there but I will not go an spend $ which only pays his pay check aswell If he's gonna constantly hang up on me u know what F u I'll galdy go an spend my $ else where I but besides him it's very nice there an Bret an nooria r very awesome ppl an I wish to go back there wen he is not there although I don't know wen that will be tho"}
{"text":"I was back at my favorite wing place last night and the food was back to it original greatness! Love the new decor and seating..our server was Lynn she did a fantastic job being wing night ..we asked for low carb beer she suggested ultra tallboys she checked in with us several time ...we were will taken care of!"}
{"text":"Yes, I know St. Louis is a franchise bar. I don't mean to write about it but I recently went there again after a few years hiatus and have to enlighten others about it...

  So, this was the place to go back in high school in North York. We had a severe lack of cool places to hang out and eat, but St. Louis wasn't half bad and it was cheap! The servers there knew we couldn't leave them any kind of decent tip so they didn't bother with us, and we didn't bother with them.. at least, I thought it was just because we were young and lacked money that the service was terrible..

 Not so.

  I should say that the chicken wings, fries or no fries daily special is nothing to sniff at! The price, flavour, and variety of heat is great, and I would probably go again if it came up, but only for the food. 

 The service at this Yonge /(north of) Sheppard location is just as bad as I remembered it. No wait, the service IS terrible. I'd rather go down the street to McDee's and get my free smile than try to pry one from the lips of the servers there. I don't think I've EVER seen anyone smile there, and service means a lot to me. I used to be a waitress and I know that a smile, albeit terrible food or atmosphere will go a long way in making someone's day brighter.

  I'll give this location and its servers one thing though; it is usually extremely busy there, especially on Tuesdays when the wings are half price. (A good night to go for cheap eats, if nothing else.) When I've gone mid day for a late lunch, St. Louis is quieter and the waiters seem to have a bit more breathing room. But still, no smile.
  
 It's as if they want to seat you, throw a few chicken wings on to your plate and get you out as soon as possible, and in that sense, St. Louis is just a typical franchise place to get cheap and fast food. I'd recommend getting take out instead so you can enjoy the great wings in the comfort and happiness of your own home!"}
{"text":"So today a couple friends went to St. Louis bar and grill to meet up with friends and catch some food.  My friends ordered Wings, Wing and Rib Combo that included a Poutine, Jalapeno poppers, Chicken Strips and Wings, and I ordered the St. Louis Burger with fries.  

Pros - The ambiance and atmosphere was really friendly and comfortable.  It's a nice little location with a good amount of T.Vs and extreamly friendly staff.  They always kept coming to the table asking how our food was and refilling our drinks.  We even carried out a conversation once in a while. 

The Burger I ordered was pretty good, I'd give it a 7 out of 10.  It came out a bit cold though which really effected its score. 

Cons - My friend who ordered the combo was very unimpressed.  He didn't even finish his food.  The Jalepeno poppers wern't good, the food came out pretty cold, and there were only 4 wings, 4 strips, and 3 poppers on his plate.  He asked for the sause on the wings to be seperated but they put it on his wings regardless.  

My Burger Combo came to - $9.95
Wings Combo - $17.95
9 Wings - $9.95 ( I think)

Prices were decent, except for the wing combo.. there wasn't enough bang for your buck there.  

All in all, it was a decent experiance but I would not recommend going for a dining experiance.  If you were going to a sports bar and this was the closest one near by to watch a game, I'd recommend this over Boston Pizza."}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once, so I'm not an expert. But on my visit it was certainly 3 stars. Maybe even 2.5. The wings were good, not great, but were delivered after sitting around a bit too long. Wings don't age well and the fries that came with them fared even worse. The meal was still good, but it would have been better if it was fresh. The 32-ounce personal pitcher of Molson Canadian helped with my meal and with my attitude about my meal. The atmosphere is fine... just an average run of the mill sports bar kind of place.
Would I eat here again? Maybe, but most likely not."}
{"text":"Our server was extremely friendly and sweet and the food (we ordered a house salad and chicken fingers) were just okay, nothing special. The peach cocktail was yummy, and the drinks were a pretty good deal, $5 for a pint. The food does take a while to come though, I think we waited for over 30 minutes. It's really difficult for some tables to also view the game because the tvs are only mounted on the walls and there's so many different games that are being played at the same time. I recommend this place for large groups for a social gathering but I wouldn't return to watch a game."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what sort of illicit substances they put in their wings and sauces, but if I don't get my fix every couple of weeks it's bad news.  This is a classic sports bar and wings spot, with very reliable quality.  I go for the large wings with fries, usually hot.  The signature dill dip remains uncontested as wings dips go.  A devil's pint of IPA or Caesar really does the job.  Hell I could for some now - half priced wings on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for the first time because of the Tuesday half price wings deal. Had to buy a large beverage as part of the deal so I got orange juice and it was really watered-down. To be honest.. it basically just tasted like water with a bit of sugar and food coloring. 

My friend and I ordered two pounds of wings, half honey garlic and half garlic parm. 
Now let me tell you, I LOVE wings and this place just didn't cut it. The wings were shamefully tiny, the flavors weren't prominent, and what little meat there was.. was  relatively dry. The only tasty part of the meal was the fries which they skimped out on and only gave ~15 for our combined basket of two pounds. 

I think I'll stick to Wild Wings. Their wings are juicy AND saucy. Definitely not as disappointing."}
{"text":"Come here every once in a while for a quick wings/fries meal. Aside from being really busy and crowded in the evenings it's mostly a good experience and good tasting food with a reasonable price especially on their 1/2 price wing night - probably better than Wild Wing i'd say.
Only criticism would be cleanliness - i find the rags they clean down tables/surfaces with questionable as they  don't look sanitary.  I once witnessed one dropped on the floor, picked up, and left at the front desk check in counter, which was later used by another server to wipe down another table with."}
{"text":"This is one of the smaller locations- parking is one of the drawbacks.

I generally come here from work and I think their lunch specials are pretty worth it.

No complaints"}
{"text":"This place is always packed, especially on Tuesdays because it's half price wings!  Like all St. Louis' they're pretty small and you have to usually wait to get seated. The first couple of times I came here, I was pleasantly surprised by the amazing customer service we had.  The restaurant owner, Tony is incredible and you can tell that he loves his job.  We were first introduced to him through a friend that worked there and because it was the grand opening.  He offered us a couple of appetizers on the house!  How awesome is that!?  Whenever we go there, he is always there to engage in conversations with us and if we request for the basketball game to be played on the TVs, he's more than happy to put it on for us.  The food is consistent with all the locations and I have yet to be disappointed by any of the dishes I've ordered. I'd have to say the last time I came here, the customer service wasn't as good.  It seemed as though they were short staffed on a Saturday evening, even with the winter weather.  The servers who worked there were not really professional.  One of them even asked us if 3 sets of cutlery were enough, when we clearly had 4 people seated at our table.  I was kind of dumbfounded when she asked that.  Also, we were only given 3 side plates as opposed to 4, even after the server said that she would come around again to give us another plate.  That's the reason why I can't particular give a 5-star but then again, maybe it was a one time thing.  On the upside of that, we were celebrating a birthday and they gave us the most delicious ice cream cake!  Regardless of the mediocre service we had the last time, I'm definitely coming back to St. Louis for wings and obviously their fries that are oh-so-addicting!"}
{"text":"Service is a hit and miss, can be brutally slow sometimes (2 hours for a table of 4...). Wings also tend to be overcooked here, so Ive stopped ordering them. All in all, nothing special about the place."}
{"text":"This just in! The old 5pm start time for half price wings on tuesdays is now 4PM -close....I think that's awesome given the demand of the consumers...they also added new flavours to try...such as Mississippi Honey Bbq , Lemon pepper and a couple more others...after dine in experience is awesome...our server is trish (beautiful brown skinned girl), I have had her as a server a couple of times before...and dining at st louis is always a delightful experience. I just couldn't think of any bad dining experience whenever I have her as a server."}
{"text":"Initially we had a rough start.  Snails pace service, poorly presented food.  Shortly after, the manager came and made good on the promise to make things right.  We love thier choice of wings and dinner options and in the end it was the same old delicious wings and we enjoyed our first go at the panzorati! ( forgive spelling!) I will keep coming and will keep bringing my friends since they are set on making sure each customer leaves happy."}
{"text":"Wings.. Burgers.. Beer... TVs...  Bar... meh..."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places... 
I usually go to either the one by Elgin Mills or one downtown but I wanted to go to a \"newer\" location and came here. For a Monday with the game (I believe it was hockey) it wasn't too packed. The seats in front of the bar area was filled but there were still a couple of spots. This location also has some very comfy booths. 
We were greeted immediately and were notified of the $14 trios. Ended up ordering buffalo wings and half rack of ribs with onion rings. Delicious. There was enough flavour and sauce. The onion rings were a bit cold in the middle (not icy though) but I guess thats how you know that they've used real onions...i hope. Everything else was great. 
During our stay, there were many pick ups. 
This restaurant is located at what I would call a \"less open space.\" You have to turn in our side streets and it is also on probably the least busiest part of 16th avenue. Personally, I don't think this matters but just in case someone wants to come here and misses it. 
The waitresses were friendly and knowledgeable. 
4 stars because there was nothing that special about this visit."}
{"text":"Walked in hoping to get lunch.  Server was too busy chatting to some guy on the other side of the place.  Total of 6ppl in reataurant at time.  Waited 10 mins longer to get menu/drink/greeting anything - then we left.  Lunch breaks are only so long."}
{"text":"Thought the wings were terrible. They were burnt all around and to saucy!!! Service was ok I guess. I'll never go back there for wings again !!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the apps.platter  great for sharing and sampling
 Service is average.  Wings are great we love the branded dill sauce! I think it's one of things that keep us coming!"}
{"text":"I'll be upfront and say that I'm not a pub person. This is probably because I'm not into sports and I'm not into alcohol. The few times I do go are usually just for food, and usually urged by someone to go. What made me come here was the all you can eat wings special promotion they had until April 20th. 

To qualify, you need to buy a drink. We had a nice cold Canadian beer. The first order of wings is 1.5lbs and thereafter it's 4 wings per order and you must finish one before you get the next one. This is a great way to sample a variety of flavors! But waiting 10-15 mins for each additional order of 4 wings is pretty annoying. Tuesday is half price wings (~$11 for 2 lbs) and you basically need to eat ~4lbs of wings to make it worth while for the all you can eat at $20. We ate around that much and became full.

I like the wings here. Since it's AYCE, I didn't mind that the wings were a little bit small. They appeared to be fried but it's not oily. Like most pubs, they don't marinate their chicken. They seem to add the sauce and seasoning after cooking it. It's still good. Some flavors are better than others but it might just be a preference thing. I really didn't like garlic parm and the Mississipi Honey BBQ. Everything else was awesome or at least decent. The best part were the fries. Fries are optional on the additional orders. They definitely added some awesome seasoning to the fries because these are probably the best fries I've ever had. 

Nothing wrong with the service. It was a busy day. Most of the servers are cute...but not that I care much. 

It was good but it's not special enough to change my opinion about pubs. I'm not really a ribs and wings kind of guy. I like my veggies and ate none here. I didn't see anything else on the menu that I really want to eat. If I really want wings, I'll come on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Anyway, the Buffalo Ranch wings were great!!  The wings themselves were a tiny but on the dry side but the Buffalo Ranch had enough sauciness and kick to it.

This time, I found the fries a little softer and not as crispy as that first time eating them and lovng them.

I still am a fan of St. Louis Bar & Grill and am looking forward to my next wings meal here!"}
{"text":"I have heard many things about this location however they must have had an off night. We noticed right off the bat after being seated in the bar area that the lighting was extremely poor and it wasn't the most pleasant environment to buckle down for a hockey game. 

We decided to go with the appetizer, entree and dessert special for $25. Their bacon wrapped mac and cheese bites were incredible - probably the best thing I had that night. It was flavourful and crispy with the right amount of richness offset with their ketchup. The boneless wings with jerk seasoning I ordered were inedible due to the excessive amount of salt on them. The dessert was quite poor as well, it was a grocery store Belgian waffle with still frozen fruit on top and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. 

Overall, it is what it is - a bar that serves food. I think they did the best they probably could that night with how busy they got. What I will say is our waitress was incredibly friendly and I would go back just for the service."}
{"text":"3.5
Great service, mediocre food...

I came here last night with a couple of my friends. We ordered the wing poutine, nachos and a pound of wings each. 

* The wing poutine was AMAZING! I wish I doubled my order because it was to die for. Highly, recommend this.

* The nachos were such a disappointment. They stinged out on the cheese and just added a whole bunch of lettuce shreds on top. They were very dry and flavourless. You're better off buying a bag of Tostitos and salsa from Walmart. It would've been cheaper and probably a lot more flavourful than the ones from this place.

* They don't have a wide selection of wing flavours unlike other places like Wacky Wings or All Stars. So if you're one of those people who like to experiment with their wing flavours this is not the place for you. Plus, the flavours weren't that great. 

The only reason I'm giving this place a 3.5 stars was because of the service. Our server Ryan (I think that was his name) was great! He was very funny, organized, attentive and very engaging with his customers. He was great at recommending items off the menu. He also went out of his way to provide us extra sauces for the wings, nachos and poutine. 
I was also really impressed when he split everyone's bills - even though it got confusing at times."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd time here , this is our first time hearing so loud. noisy not the customer but the worker. They think that nobody is around them.  Very disappointed. Well I guess she's done her shift that's why she's acting like that , 
but she shouldn't be behind the counter."}
{"text":"Everything is fairly standard. The service is polite and fast, the food is good but not mind blowing the atmosphere is clean and generic but not hard on the eye either and I love their hand dryers. Don't come here expecting anything exotic but if you have a dude working behind the bar then he might be the owners son, ask him to mix you a drrink, he's fairly good at it. I'm not too sure if he works there anymore however. Regardless I recomend you go if your meeting up for drinks arround the STC."}
{"text":"Good St. Louis like food in a small bar and restaurant. This place just needs some more years on it. Plenty of televisions and hockey on every one. The food is good. The seasoning and spices are different and interesting. This is a chain restaurant and one of the better ones. Cold beer, good service and a warm place to relax in subzero temps. Give this place some wear and tear and you have a real winner!"}
{"text":"St. Louis is supposed to be a sports bar, and yet when we went in to watch a hockey game (a PLAYOFF game at that), the rude bartender/manager wouldn't put the sound on. As soon as we walked in at 7pm, we asked if they would play the game with sound. She said yes - \"when the game starts.\" We ordered beer and wings and at 7:30, the anthems started and we asked for the sound to be turned on. She said \"When the game starts.\" The puck dropped a few minutes later, and we had to get up and ask her to turn the sound on. She replied by saying \"no one wants to listen to the game guys.\" Then why did you agree to put it on, let us order and eat instead of going to a different bar, and then be extremely rude? I don't know if she is unaware that she works at a sports bar or she just likes to be rude to customers. I won't be going back here again."}
{"text":"This location was better.

This used to be a great family wing place.  Its much quieter now.  They closed off the seating section in the back and now its a cheers like bar in the front with maybe 20 tables, and that's being generous.  The game is still on TV.

Our most recent trip featured my having my wings done Buffalo style, my wife having hers with Jerk sauce, my younger daughter enjoying Mac & Cheese, and my vegatarian daughter giving everyone in the restaurant the teenage girl stare of death.

The fries that came with my wings were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - in other words - darn close to perfection.  The wings were good, perhaps a 7 out of 10, but not great, but not forgettable.

I really want to try the chili, but I fear that at $8 it either A) won't satisfy my hunger, or B) taste disgusting like the Chili at the Tim Hortons in Komoka.  Though I've never had a bad item at this restaurant in two years of dining here.

We had a nice waitress, but I'm not good a remembering names, but she gave us a few suggestions, and ran back to the kitchen to get some answers when we asked about an item that appears on their website's menu that is not on the kids menu.

We will repeat."}
{"text":"There's a patio in the back area along with a tv.The whole area is fenced and there's nothing to look at but it's a nice place to chill.

The indoor seating is very limited and there was a line up last time I was there on a Tuesday night(half price wings!!).

They have daily drink specials at this location,which I thought was nice.I believe it was $4.95 tall cans on Tuesdays and $3.50 mixed drinks on Fridays.

Since this is a chain,the food is very similar to other locations.Although,I did get less fries than other locations when I ordered a pound of wings.Disappointing.

Oh and they have free wifi."}
{"text":"While the food was thoroughly delicious and worth it in the end, the service is the primary reason for this 3 star review. The wait was ridiculously long. While there were multiple servers, most of them were idling around and socializing with each other while 1-2 people did most of the work. When we went, the place wasn't even close to being full - most tables were empty. We found the wait due to this to be unacceptable. We got the wing poutine, quesadilla, and half a pound of buffalo wings. I have nothing to complain about the food. The only thing that could have been better was the poutine - it could have used more cheese!"}
{"text":"I really love the wings here. I get the medium saucy boneless wings and they never disappoint. But really everything is good! 

Also, the bruscetta is really good. Not as strong of an onion or garlic flavor in comparison to normal bruscettas, it has a very cool taste. 

I love how there is a customer review survey on the receipt, when you complete the survey you get a free appetizer for your next visit!"}
{"text":"Wosrt lunch ever. I didnt mind the waiting to be seated and the server was helpful but it went down hill from there. Looked like only one waitress and a manager to look after everyone. It was a long wait for everything. 20 mins from when we sat down for food. 20 mins my sister had to wait for her refill of pop. 1st order of wings was good. 2nd was ok. 3rd was over cooked and not good at all. I have easily done meals in 45 mins....this lunch took 2 hours ans all we had was wings, didnt even eat my fries. We did over half our time waiting for everything. I have felt sick ever since. Never going back."}
{"text":"Came here with my coworkers for my pre-wedding dinner. It was a pretty good experience. The serving staff were fantastic and very nice. They were informative and let us know what the deal of the day was. We ordered drinks and it literally came in an instant. She was fast and very courteous, so it made the entire process very nice. We ordered a bunch of food, don't even remember what we got. It was very nice inside, smaller than other st Louis I find. Service was fantastic, polite and quick! I'll probably come back again because of the service. It was quite busy but I think we were attended to quite a bit. So definitely a 3.5 to 4 star rating."}
{"text":"st loius is alright in terms of their wings. Sometimes they aren't saucy enough or the favour isnt there. Heat is non exisit under 4 and even 4 is eh okay i feel it.

they have better half off Tuesday deal since their wings are cheaper and seem like you do get fair amount and its good.

all and all its not bad and it good price. just med sized place that packed in its table. Moving around isnt easy but its managable. it does get busy on tuesday deals. but being close to stc and movie tuesday deal."}
{"text":"This is the best St Louis so far! I've been to the one at Warden and hwy 7 and the one at Fairview mall, and I still think this location is the best. The servers are friendly and welcoming. Food is good and I'm able to bring my baby's car seat with me. Bathrooms are pretty clean and the area is spacious. Not cramped like the other locations. Very accommodating! Whether they are busy or slow, they really know how to do their job! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"So got there Saturday night completely packed around 6 ... we order the TRIO 

Appitizer 
Wings 
And cake 



Tell me why it came out alll. At. Once. 

So stupid. 
So we eat the macaroni cheese balls and inside was cold so we got new ones. 

By the time we ate the cake it melted * I'll insert pic * 


It's really bad service and the chefs clearly don't care. My waitress was my favourite part of the night ! Super nice. Small blonde girl. She was so nice and very helpful. 

Wouldn't go back to that one."}
{"text":"I usually head upstairs and order wings. Dry wings are very tasty especially Cajun. Go for cheesy wings if you don't mind getting ur hands dirty. Wings comes with curly fries which can be substituted for a salad or onion rings

Parking is a headache especially on Tuesday nights (1/2 price wings night). Otherwise this place is pretty good"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday after work, got the Monday special, 2lbs of wings and fries with a pitcher for 30 bucks. There were about 4 tables, with only 1 server. She was busy entertaining the customers at the bar, it took forever for her to take our order, but she was sweet and friendly. When our food came after 20 minutes, both the wings and fries were cold. We got the \"hot\" flavour under the \"sauciest\" category, but it came dry. We spoke to the server, she explained that the sauce was at the bottom, and usually the hot one is not as saucy as the hotter than hell flavour. But she did offer to toss the wings again and give us new fries. Overall, this place has bad food and slow service. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Service was quick and friendly, but likely because the wings were not freshly prepared. Wings were lukewarm (probably from under a warming lamp) and tasted like the fish that must have been fried in the fryer earlier. Don't remember ever leaving a wing place hungry,  now I do."}
{"text":"Ended up here for lunch.  Place only had 5 other people in restaurant.  I asked for a IPA on tap and the waitress said yes Keith's .  I said I'll have the Lagunitas . She didn't know her beers. Not sure why a sports bar like this hasn't figured out the beer business and fails to have chilled glasses. Wine selection is terrible no California chards very basic Ontario wines.  Not sure why a huge franchise wouldn't have the wine business figured out?? We ordered our food, 25 minutes later waitress came back and said we are out of turkey for the sandwich. We're thinking seriously the place is empty and it took that long to figure that out?  I ordered the cheese burger and it was very good. I said to the waitress when we were done that we are all set.  She failed to understand that lingo twice so I just asked for the bill."}
{"text":"This location is tiny. The service was terrible. Our waitress told us that her shift was over and asked us to settle up while eating our mains. We agreed and she said she would bring our desserts over. Needless to say, she did not return. We waited 20 mins before we flagged another waitress down. We told her what happened and she brought our desserts out. Food is only average. Have not and will not return again"}
{"text":"Going for half price wings on a Tuesday is only a couple dollars less than regular price because you have to buy a beverage. So it's really based on whether you think time is money bc we waited for 50-55 mins around 6pm. 

Go 45 minutes or more before you actually expect to eat!

My total was around $13 including tip.
The wings actually tasted really good. Some people say \"not bad\" but I think it's better than that. I have a small portion size and was at a pretty comfortable level after eating the veggie sticks and wings (except for one and a half.) I gave my bf one and a half of my wings bc a pound with fries still wasn't enough to keep him full. He said he should have gotten 2 pounds.

The waitresses were friendly and the service was good, no complaints here!"}
{"text":"First time and last, the service was good, but food wasn't good, we ordered wings and ribs and no flavor, tasted like frozen food, I don't recommend it"}
{"text":"I don't even want to rate 1 star to this restaurant!!! Horrible management. I witnessed an extremely horrible scene when I went there for a nice dinner with my husband. The manager insulted a group of people for not having space for them! And the worst part was the manager showed finger to the eldest person of the group!!!! Can you imagine?? I left the place and will never go back. (If the group want to use me as a witness I'm always ready, if I was in their place I would have called the cops!)"}
{"text":"There are much better wing joints around, but St Louis is consistent. This place is set up well in that it has a big screen for sports and an elevated bar area.  Good for UFC events.  Right by the highway makes it a good meeting spot."}
{"text":"This location is better than some of the others.  It's larger and more well lit than most.  Food is the usual.  There is also some very friendly staff at this location."}
{"text":"service was pretty good, came at 4pm on a tuesday and we didnt have to wait at all
do not get the caribbean jerk flavour, it's not good
i'd recommend the hot n honey flavour
if you have high spice tolerance, get four stars or above"}
{"text":"Stopped by here after spending the day at Wonderland. The wings were good but the fries were amazing. Normally I just pick at fries because they're so bland but not these ones - they were tasty and seasoned. Not a single one was left in the end

The service was beyond my expectations. Our server was friendly, knowledgable and accommodating not only to us, but to other tables she was serving as well. Great first impression of the St. Louis chain and hopefully other locations are just as good :)"}
{"text":"decided to give this place a second try to redeem itself. First time around i came with a bunch of friends and me and another friend ordered ribs and sweet potato fries. the fries were good but the ribs were STONE COLD throughout for both of us! most of my friends got wings so i tried theirs and it was ok.  waiter was nice enough to get us fresh ribs.  So on my second visit i went with the ribs again (just to see if i got unlucky the first time) while my friend got wings. as bad luck would have it, i was given cold ribs AGAIN! told the waitress and she gave me real attitude.  this is my first ever bad review for a restaurant and i felt compelled to write it without any ulterior motive because the food is just not up to par or consistent at all with other barbecue joints in richmond hill"}
{"text":"Good wings, clean place, servers are great but in Tuesdays they ca. Be uber busy so be patient.  10 fold a step above shitty \"wild wings\" which is not a great place.  2lbs of wings gets you 2 flavours with no surcharge and always free fries and veggie sticks!

100% Canadian"}
{"text":"Brutal. The only restaurant I the world I have consciously  chosen not to go back to ever. 

The good: Location and patio are great on a summer afternoon.  Cool upstairs that would be awesome for watching sports. 

The bad:  I've been here 5 times hoping things would get better. 4 of the 5 times they got the order wrong. Every time the service was more than 30 minutes from order to serve.( these are chicken wings and fries!)

the worst: for a chicken wing spot the wings are just plain disappointING. Frozen scrawny bits of too saucy nastiness. 

This is not a wing spot it is a beer spot. If you like Budweiser, you are in luck. 

If you want wings, try another spot."}
{"text":"I came here for on a weekday with some friends of mine. I got a half pound of wings for 6.99, and shared onion rings with my friends. The wings were alright, but the meat on mine was dry, and the skin on the wings was tougher than what I'm used to. Also, I paid $6.99 for this, and only got 5 wings, I believe. The onion rings were great though.
Service was also A-okay.
Might come back if my friends want to, but I wouldn't go here on my own."}
{"text":"I used to come here for half price wings on Tuesdays before I knew about half price wings at Dakgogi. Don't get me wrong, St. Louis wings are great. I just prefer my chicken to be fried... and Korean.

I recently came here on a Wednesday for a $5 Angus burger special which was served with a side of their signature delicious thick cut fries (picture below). Burger was fresh and juicy. It reminded me of burger binge week. Wednesdays are not as crowded as Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Wings were good. Fairly small space, but 7 tv's. Best part of the place is the service. 
It's a bar that serves food. Multiple local beers on tap. 
I'll go back."}
{"text":"I've given this place a few tries but they always seem to be understaffed. Great place for wings and beers, but the wait is definitely not worth it. I've waited almost twenty minutes before having a waitress/waiter even coming to the table in the beginning on a Saturday after 6."}
{"text":"Every time I go here the service is very bad. Nobody sat us down to our table. When we picked a table, took someone 20 mins to clean it up. Didn't get water until 30 mins later. Didn't get my Pepsi until 40 mins later. Didn't get my appetizers until an hour later... HOW... it was so bad. The waitress was so slow. Asked for the bill and came 15 mins later. Food was meh.... I will never go here again."}
{"text":"The new owners are doing an amazing job with this place.   They have great television sets and the food is great as usual.   My kids and I love the fries.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here to try the wings you should! Now I'm not a wing master or anything but they were pretty good. Standard wings and standard prices. The waitress was good and straight to the point. I ordered the smokey BBQ heat wings. My oh my! Wasn't expecting that much of a kick.. It's not spicy but def has some kick to it! My fiancée ordered the hot wings and he gobbled those up like nobody's business.

Verdict? It's a good wing spot. There dill sauce is amazing with the fries!!"}
{"text":"A few years ago I posted a review for St. louis that I found accurate and obviously based on my own opinion and experience there. 
I received a message on Yelp from the owner offering a chance to redeem themselves. Although I never took her up on the offer (thanks Karen but I couldn't: i like to go when no one knows i'm there- it makes for a more honest review) i did go back.

Two reasons I did was because like Karen explained they were having an \"off\" night and because everyone deserves to have a second chance- after all even if you have a really bad experience somewhere it takes a very mature and visionary business owner/manager to read yelp reviews and build a better business on constructive criticism. 

I don't give bad reviews to screw with people- i do it to reflect honesty and to hopefully save people (mainly customers) from mediocre service.

Going back to St. louis- under the radar- and I must admit that my experience with them so many years ago was obviously a bad \"off\" night for them. This time around it was way better! 

It wasn't the absolute very best ever but it was good enough to return! 

Thanks St.Louis and thanks Karen!"}
{"text":"Don't even bother. If you come on a Tuesday and your boyfriend is vegetarian, he's going to have to sit there and watch you eat wings. They refuse to bring vegetarian options upstairs! Because apparently only their downstairs kitchen is capable of making a veggie burger. And their veggie burgers are actually quite good...
So stupid.

Otherwise if you come for the wings which I assume you would, you're in luck bevause the wings and fries are always good. But if you have a vegetarian friend you either have to wait in the line for a long time to get seated downstairs, or your friend gets to order fries and watch you eat your entree while they pick at an appetizer. The restaurant even made a special \"upstairs menu\" which excluded anything that is made exclusively downstairs, and this new menu included fish and chips. But they won't bring that up either! Our server, as nice as she was, wasn't helpful in any way. We also couldn't understand a word she said, which was important because we wanted to know what our options were. Very unfortunate. We really expected more after coming here consistently for over 5 years."}
{"text":"I met a friend for a drink and lunch.  When I got there it was dead quiet.  For a NFL Sunday I figured the place might be packed but even when I left at 3:00 pm it had only 10 customers.  So if you like to enjoy the game in peace - stop on by. 

The food was mediocre.  The onion chips were served fast and hot but the dipping sauce had no zip. 

I ordered a burger and my friend had the wings. The burger was tasteless and could have done with a jalapeño cheddar or blue cheese as an add-on.  The patty itself was so-so and compared to other burgers I had had earlier in the week it was a weak patty. 

My friend commented the wings were fine and he feel the sauce was ok. 

The service was again ok.  It seems the rule was for every beer ordered you got two glasses of water.  It certainly made a pit stop to the Men's necessary before leaving. 

I will certainly look for another place to meet my friend for the next time."}
{"text":"Big thumbs down for this place. An hour and 30 minutes for wings that came cold and dry and we were in an empty restaurant? The kitchen needs a shake up"}
{"text":"The absolute worst wings ive ever had in my life. One was so burnt it broke in half when picked up. A disgusting experience."}
{"text":"We usually eat here once a month and this time I got food poisoning from having: long Island ice tea, boneless wings and Macaroni & cheese wrapped with bacon. I was in the washroom for a good 30 mins and my abdominal pain was unbearable. I could not even walk and by the time I got outside my whole meal was out. First time being admitted to the hospital for food poisoning and it was not fun. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Dropped in for a drink on my birthday...boneless wing plus draught was the special we were told. It turns out this wasn't so on the bill. We got hustled for dessert because it was my birthday, so what the hell right? They didn't even sing happy birthday. Anyway  yeah we got charged for the birthday dessert that I didn't enjoy let alone finish."}
{"text":"I did not realize that wings and ribs are such a Canadian thing until my friend requested them before she leaves Canada for good. Despite being a chain, St Louis has great quality food other than just their wings.

We usually get the wing and ribs combo to share. You can choose so many flavours. The wings can be fried, breaded or grilled. 

The ambience is that of the sports bar so be prepared for sudden outburst of cheers or swears. Kinda makes me jumpy since I tend to pay more attention to the food than the TV screen. Service can be slow at times but doesn't really detract from the experience as its a place to hang out and chat with friends... unless your group is super hangry"}
{"text":"We came here during Taste the Danforth. This was the only place that didn't have a line up. Should of been the first clue! Haha. Service was slow. Very slow. The restaurant wasn't packed so I don't know why it was so slow. Not enough servers?? Drinks took a long time to come. Food was cold. Who wants cold nachos? We asked for extra meat. I think I got three chips with meat on it. That was it. Wings $14.99. Seems steep considering the service is slow and food isn't good & it's cold. No one checked up on us after we got the food so we couldn't get it warmed up.
Wouldn't return. Don't recommend."}
{"text":"Great place but sadly the crazy woman running the cafe next door ruined it for us. I parked at the back by the fence and a woman in an apron came outside screaming at me. I had no idea who she was or what her problem was. My boyfriend was walking over to get smokes at the store next door and she had a problem with that. I explained we were going into the restaurant for his birthday party, he just wanted cigarettes. She screamed take your car and leave. I said I'm going into the restaurant to meet his friends, she threatened to call the police and said she'd have my car towed in seconds. She screamed this is her property. She acted like a child throwing a tantrum only she's an adult and English isn't her first language. The way she acted is pathetic and I hope no one gives her a dime. She made us get into my car and drive next door. He got his smokes, then we turned around and parked in the exact same spot. This isn't how you treat people. We complained to the on duty manager at St Luis. She said they've had lots of problems with this woman and their customers constantly have issues with her. Nothing was done though. We were basically told \"too bad\". Disappointing. We were both in bad moods after that and his birthday was pretty much ruined. We wouldn't go back because of her."}
{"text":"I really like this place and here's why:
- There are tv screens situated all over this place. No matter which direction you are seated, you'll be able to get a great view of whatever sporting event is on. The tv screens directly above the bar area are massive and resolution is crisp. 
- The waitresses are all very beautiful, and provide great service.
- Although I don't know them personally, the owners seem like genuinely very nice people and care about their customers. 
- My nachos came 'loaded' with toppings such as cheddar cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos. The portion size was massive. I added extras such as guacamole and chilli. Down to the very end, there were rarely any naked tortilla chips. (5/5)
- We also got the bucket special which gave us 4 tall cans (domestic) over lots of ice. I kept things nice and fresca by guzzling down some Coors light. 

On previous occasions, I do recall their thick cut fries and signature dill sauce to be quite satisfing. 

This is my go to spot around the Scarborough Town Centre area. I rather here then, Jack Astor's or Moxie's."}
{"text":"They told us we would need to wait 30 minutes for a table. After an hour we went back in and they said it would be \"a while\" til we could be seated."}
{"text":"Sometimes you gotta go where the beer is cold and the wings are hot. 

Good service, good food, good times"}
{"text":"Was Eager to try this with that one last positive review.
Positive : service was good. Server checked up on us and recommend food. 
Food : ordered nachos and wing poutine. The nachos were crispy but heavily loaded with cheese and it wasn't that the nachos were good it was that when something is loaded with loads of cheese it automatically tastes good. Yet no inspiration/ innovation went into it.  Wing poutine is a good idea if one can pull it off. They weren't too salty, I ordered them hot but they weren't. Yet somehow they still lacked flavour after that wing sauce/ breaded chicken / cheese n gravy. 
It's more of a small sports bar to grab drinks and have some decent carbs while getting drunk. I might be back. Always give them a second Chance to redeem themselves."}
{"text":"Order:
GARLIC DILL CHICKEN 
BURGER
Hand-breaded boneless breast of 
chicken fried and tossed in hot wing 
sauce. Served on a Brioche bun and 
topped with Velveeta cheese, smoked 
bacon, onion straws, our famous Garlic 
Dill sauce, all the fixings and their
signature golden fries.

Impression:
The chicken breast had a nice crunchy panko type batter and was super moist and juicy. The onion rings added that extra crunch. Bacon speaks for itself :) and of course I had to have a nice juicy tomatoe. The brioche bun was nice and soft and held everything together. In my opinion this burger actually ties with Duke Refresher's chicken club sandwhich (check out my review on Duke's). Their fries were excellent with that signature rippled thick cut.. I wish they had gave the garlic dill sauce with those fries. (The Scarborough town centre location does!). The service was exceptional and our waitress really took care of us."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant is the worst. You always have to wait to be seated for at least 5 minutes and it's not like you can seat yourself since all the tables are either occupied or dirty.
There is so much staff but I guess they don't know what they are doing.

The last time I went here the chicken wings were so chewy and tasted like they had been reheated. When I mentioned it to my waitress she told me that they don't reheat and it's apparently always like that. I've probably been to this restaurant 50 times all over Toronto and don't remember it ever being that gross. 

Won't be returning to this location even though I live so close to it."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've seen a place in north Brampton that has consistently decent food, service, and traffic to go along with it! Been four times, each equally satisfying. The onion ring apetizer basket is top notch. The boneless wings did seem a bit hard. The burgers (beef/chicken) didn't impress me much. I never regret taking advantage of the weekly deals though!"}
{"text":"As far as bar and grills go this one is loud. Too loud. And everywhere you look there is a television. So if your goal is to go watch some sports with a gang this place is great. But if what you want is a nice family dinner of beer and wings... forget it.

We were not the only only family dinning. And certainly between 5:30 and 8:00 the place is accommodating to Kids. Thats a plus, and the kids do not seem to mind the noise, in fact ours were revelling in it.

The food is quite good. Ribs and wings are probably as good as you can get. Tasty and large portions. Good selection of beers. And I do like the fact that there are clearly a lot of locals and regulars.

It is close to the subway so that is a benefit for those more bingey nights but I am still stuck on the fact that no matter were you sit you can see at least 5 TV's. Personally I find this terribly distracting and this is not a place I would choose to go."}
{"text":"I came on a Wednesday evening with my boyfriend, and was impressed with my overall experience. The Angus Burger on Wednesday is just $5.50. Another Hump Day treat: $5.50 pints of domestic draft. 

Such a juicy, tasty burger. Very surprised to get plentiful fresh toppings. Great portion of fries too. I highly recommend going. The servers are so professional,  and they truly went above and beyond to make our visit great."}
{"text":"I can now highly recommend the ribs, and also point out that, for wings, the suicide sauce is the best balance of heat and flavor.  The service as always is fast, friendly, and top-notch.  This is a *great* place to watch hockey games; full of great people but not too crowded, and the pouring of the ales doesn't skip a beat no matter how many they pack in.  Still one of my favorite spots in Vaughan."}
{"text":"I'm here almost every Thursday . Very nice place and the server is very nice too. It's half price appetizer night. So it's great to have a night here"}
{"text":"They have a patio place, but it's always empty because for some reason the waitresses don't want to serve patio dinning. We are turned down not one, not twice, but everytime. We were told in a sunny afternoon \"it's going to rain\"; and we were told in a summer evening \"it's going to be very cold\"; we saying it's okay we just wait to sit on the patio, and they said still no patio, and they don't really care if you walk out, and even cheerful for your leaving. What a bad service."}
{"text":"I live in the area and so my bf and I frequent the place because we actually enjoy the wings and that dill sauce is awesome! However the service is consistently bad. Our last experience was where our server excused herself because she needed to sneeze and didn't even go at the back and wash her hands after. She sneezed into her sleeve told us she had a cold and was not well and how it 'was all coming out now'. We have worked in restaurants for years and that's pretty gross! She just looked miserable and was sniffling all night long. If there's one thing we have learnt working in the industry its that when you or a staff member is sick you call in because its unacceptable to be handling other people's food and drinks when you are visibly sick with a cold or flu. I would proably go back but start getting my wings to go!"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here during a day at Canada's Wonderland.  They had a great special the day we were here - pound and a pint for about $10.  Clean and yummy.  Fries were good too.  It is an easy walk across the street from the amusement park (they don't let you leave the parking lot without paying to come back). I highly recommend it for a nice break, good food  and a great price vs. amusement park food.  I would come again."}
{"text":"Went in last night (Friday June 8th 2018) with a friend for a late dinner.  Arrived just before 9 and it was obviously busy.  Waited to be seated for about 5 minutes when we finally grabbed a server and he suggested we could just seat ourselves on the patio.  Sat on the patio for another 5 minutes before the same server came and asked our drink orders.  We asked if we could place our food order as we had already decided what we wanted, but the server said that he would just take our drink orders and be back in a minute to take our food order.  A few minutes later our drinks had arrived, but the server never came back to us.  Approximately 30 (THIRTY!!!) minutes later we had finally given up.  The server never came back to take our food order, and we were just about finished our drinks.  My friend went inside to pay, but came out another 5 minutes later and said that our server would bring the bill soon.  When our server FINALLY came to us, he apologized for the wait and looked puzzled when we said that we were waiting to order food.  We probably could have waited, but if he couldn't be bothered to even take our food order, imagine how long it would have taken for our actual food to arrive.  

Our server suggested that he would \"take bettet care of us next time\", and I replied \"Why would I ever come back here?\".  We paid for our drinks (for which he offered absolutely no discount) and left no tip at all.  Just under an hour wasted with no food.

During our stay on the patio, I witnessed two other couples be seated on the patio, and then ignored for several minutes.

I will not be visiting this establishment again as they obviously do not have enough staff to cover the restaurant on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"This is my favourite St. Louis location.  The food is always great and the servers (and manager) are very kind and helpful.  Service is usually very fast (except Tuesday evenings, but that's understandable) compared to other locations as well.  This is my go-to spot for wings.  Always consistent and always delicious.  

My only complaint is that the water and any soft drinks you get here taste like soap.  Every single time.  Other than that, it's all great."}
{"text":"The service at this location is horrendous. 

DO NOT come here for all you can eat wings unless you enjoy waiting 30-40 minutes between each 'round' (in fact, the third 'round' is an astounding 4 wings served in an ice cream bowl). 

Our server was friendly, but barely attentive as we had to flag her down to order anything, including refills. The odd time she asked if we were ready to order, she would reply with \"okay, just one second\" and proceed to manage other tables (so why even ask us?). 

This was one of those rare times I didn't bother asking for water because it would only distract our server from delivering food, but in hindsight sipping on water may have made the wait less bothersome. 

Even though this place was quite busy, apologizing for extensive wait times can go a long way and prevent reviews like this; I will definitely not give this place another shot -- stick to the downtown location!"}
{"text":"Me and my friend were having lunch here. About the good things: we loved the food and location. 
However , the customer service our waitress provided was terrible. First of all, it felt like she never wanted us to come in this place. Secondly, no refills were provided. Thirdly, she gave us the bill even though we never asked for that. She came after 3-4 minutes with the machine and when we were paying the bills, she  just stood over, which felt quite uncomfortable. 
When we were leaving, it was clear that we're not welcome here for the next time."}
{"text":"This location is VERY popular during weekday luncheons since it is near the prime spot around Highway 400 & Highway 7 where many Offices and Manufacturers are situated.  I often come in to see tables full of GUYS in Business Casuals similar to myself.

Come here for their LUNCH WINGS SPECIAL as I've never had anything else since that is the only thing worth it's value in my own opinion.  Once again if you've read my notes around, this is the WINGS place where I get my DRY selection.

The atmosphere here has a bit of CLASS mixed with the SPORTS Bar which is more appealing to me than the Wild West of Wild Wings.  Maybe if I was BORN in the Wild West I might feel more comfortable at Wild Wings, maybe...

This St. Louis can almost be evidence that LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION can make a business successful.  As well it DID have a niche around this area until OTHER Wings restaurant recently decided to invest in this area of Vaughan as well."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday night for 1/2 price wings and I was surprised that I had a very pleasant and smooth experience at this St. Louis location. I've only ever been to St. Louis once and it was the one on Hwy 7. The one on Hwy 7 was terrible compared to this location! 

We got at the restaurant at 6:30pm and there was a long wait list (~8 parties ahead of us). We were seated at 7pm and our food came at around 7:15. Pretty quick for a full house kind of night, I'd say. Our server served our drinks and food promptly and came back to check on us a couple times throughout. The wings were juicy and they had just the right amount of sauce coated on them. I got the Mississippi Honey one and I didn't really taste that much honey. My boyfriend got the Hot & Honey one and it wasn't too spicy (only  level ). Definitely not strong enough for spicy food lovers. We both would much prefer our go-to honey garlic wings. Another thing that I was surprised about was that the wings were actually a regular size compared to the ones I got previously at the Hwy 7 location when I went on a Tuesday. The ones at the Hwy 7 one were TINY. That's why I contemplated on coming back to a St. Louis but I'm glad I did. I'll definitely be coming back to this location next time!"}
{"text":"Met up with a pal here on Thursday night. This location is in Fairview Mall (closest to the Sheppard Avenue side); there's a lot of parking on site and you can also jump on the subway from here.

Anyway, not unique to this location, but St Louis have deals almost every night of the week. On Thursday, it's 50% off of starters/appetizers from 4:00 pm to closing. The food is pretty average here; they serve your typical pub fare. We had the deep fried pickles (you can never go wrong with this) and chicken quesadillas. The latter were pretty 'meh' so you can definitely skip ordering it. It's pretty happening for a Thursday night; my pal and I arrived at around nine o'clock and we managed to snag the last open table. 

Considering the food was okay, I have to give kudos to the staff. They were really attentive and came around often to see how we were doing.

My pal lives right across the street and it's on my way home so I think that we may use this place as a regular meeting point. 

Good for: drinks, pub grub, casual night out"}
{"text":"was there for 5 hours, watching the leafs and JSP fight...
leafs won, and JSP won.. was a good night..
but not just that, the service was great all night long, and food was decent.
can't say was the best wings i've ever had, but didn't go there for food anyways... beer and some salty snacks..
they had TV screen everywhere and were very accommodating to all my requests... 
def will go back..
:)"}
{"text":"Go to St. Louis wings all the time. Came to this location expecting the same amount of customer service. The waitress was extremely rude. Never had this experience of customer service. I've Been neglected before but never had this amount of personality come from a waitress. When asked the waitress about the specials that l I noticed outside, she flipped the menu open and said she doesn't know about those ones but the weekly specials in here. Just read it. When she brought our food out, we asked for the St. Louis special sauce, she was rude about it. Brought the bill out while I was still eating. Needed to pay with credit but never came back with the terminal. Fries and burger were both over cooked and dry. Left a really bad impression of St. Louis wings in general."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and welcoming and the bar had lots of TVs. The food was mediocre sportsbar fare (I had Wing/Rib combo) however what I expected. The beer selection was spartan yet they made me a tasty drink called a Hat Trick slammer. Not many choices of bars in the area do good places for a drink and a game."}
{"text":"i am a st louis wings fan for 4 years now and  i went pretty much to all the Toronto locations. this location has the most parking spot. we were there for jays play offs, kind of too busy, but who cares hot food. hot servers, cold beer. it is better to call ahead for reservation .. i advise you to try the garlic Parm sauce. we will be back"}
{"text":"Had wings here on Wednesday 

2 stars cause service was good - that's about it

Ordered Frank's hot wings dry rub (1lb) and Some other flavour (1lb)

The wings were tiny and dry, there wasn't even enough seasoning to cover the wings. The other flavour, half the wings didn't even have sauce on them. 

This place has the worst wings ever , head over to all stars."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a St. Louis', and I will have to admit that when I review this place I will be doing so as a direct comparison to another wing place, \"Duffs\" (which I haven't reviewed yet, probably because I've been there so many times I've forgotten that it too is in fact a real restaurant). I'll make them my next review.

This particular restaurant isn't that big given its location. The inside is pretty small and so is the patio. If you are bringing a large crowd here at a busy time I wouldn't expect that you'll find an open table waiting for you.

St. Louis wings are pretty decent. They are a decent size, and when you order them they come in either a batch of 9 or 18. Not too sure why they opted for 9 and 18 instead of 10 and 20. Maybe because each order (regardless of size) comes with fries and they figure those fries make up for the one (or two) fewer chicken wings you received. 

The fries are pretty good, and the dill dipping saw is pretty good (even though it comes in a McDonald chicken nugget sauce type container).

One thing I liked about St. Louis wings over Duffs was that they aren't as oily/greasy. They were relatively dry compared to Duffs', which will (often) come in a bowl so full of sauce and oil that you could take it home with you if only you hadn't discarded your empty Starbuck's cup. 

However, because they Duffs wings come to generously sauced, you won't have to second guess what flavour you've ordered.  At St. Louis I had \"hot & honey\". After I was done, I don't know what \"hot & honey\" tasted like. Oh wait, I guess it tasted like chicken...

Also, unlike Duffs you can't mix and match flavours. If you order 18 wings and want to 2 flavours, I do believe you are out of luck. I didn't ask if I could split up the flavours but thats just because the menu made a point of saying you had \"one flavour choice\". At Duffs you can split up flavours (I think as long as each flavour is in denominations of 10)

Bottom line, St. Louis is pretty good, but compared to Duffs it's highly unlikely you'll encounter lines of people waiting for their wings."}
{"text":"I actually really enjoy St. Louis Wings compared to the other pub chains that specialize in chicken wings. This is the first St. Louis I've been to, and the only one, so I can't really compare it to other St. Louis' out there. 
Let's start of with their wings, Tuesday is half price on wings, shucks, should have came on a Tuesday. Monday is $15.99 for 15 boneless wings, with fries and 20oz of beer. The wings are pretty good here too, tender and juicy with great flavours to choose from, my favourite being honey garlic still.

Their fries, I swear are their speciality. THE DILL PICKLE SAUCE mmmmm. I don't usually enjoy dill pickle, but this is GOOD.

Usually, I think the service is pretty good, but when I went yesterday, it was pretty busy and it took nearly half an hour to process four bills through the VISA machine. WHAT?!"}
{"text":"Chicken wings were hot but fries were cold, chicken wings look so dark like it was over-fry in oil or maybe they didn't change the oil . When it came to paying for the food, asked the waitress for the bill and she forgot about us. 30mins later after flagging down a waitress, told them we were waiting for the bill and she was shocked that we didn't get it?"}
{"text":"This is was stop #4, right after Eton's, on the Danforth Social Meetup's 2nd Danforth pubcrawl.  What a contrast!

No live music, no friendly vibe, no patrons there just to have fun and are long since over themselves, no Walter to greet us and tell us about future dates. 

I felt like we needed to hit up at least one very \"chain\" place and that is exactly what this is.  Lots of screens, lots of sports, lots of the typical beer.

I felt like the staff were fine--saw no issue with the customer service.  A bouncer had to cut off one of our members but I never got the full story as to what was said to who.

The thing that did strike me was that it seems like there was a bad vibe here towards us.  It was mostly younger guys and groups of younger people but it felt like we crashed a party we were not invited to.  But this is a boring chain pub--aren't only the little independent dives allowed to act as club houses?

We didn't stick around for long.  Can't recommend it although it is totally fine for wings and safe beers if you need somewhere to go to watch the game."}
{"text":"Went here an afternoon for lunch so it was pretty empty. I like the space, it's nicely organized with sections and looks clean. Our waitress was very sweet but took us long to get our drinks which was disappointing. I got the cheddar burger which was delicious and filling. Their fries are great. Nothing fancy but I had a good experience."}
{"text":"Nice, clean, and chill environment as befitting a bar franchise.

Went for some wings for lunch with some co-workers.  The wings were a little over-fried but non-breaded which is my preference.  Make sure to try the garlic parm flavour, it is quite good."}
{"text":"It's Tuesday half price Chicken Wings. Hard to say no to that after a good exercise of ping pong. My friends all took 2lbs of wings, but I was craving for some ribs too. Decided to take half ribs half wings instead with their $5 beer after 9:00PM. Took the authentic Buffalo sauce for the wings and it tasted amazing if you like spicy. The ribs were ok, somewhat tendered but I've tried better ones elsewhere. This restaurant is really for people wants food while watching sport game."}
{"text":"Many people I know love going to St. Louis on Tuesdays for half-price wings with the purchase of a drink (I used to be one of them too). For around $12 plus tax and tip (prices may have increased), you get a pound of wings, a side of fries, and a can of pop on Tuesdays after 6pm. The fries are AMAZING and the wings are decent sized and taste quite good. Unfortunately, the flavour selection is slim and I wouldn't say this is the best wings deal offered in the GTA.

The downside is that there is always a long wait time to be seated and then to be served at this location. It's one of the few locations that is located uptown, so it gets very busy during game nights and Tuesdays in general. If you're craving wings, save yourself the trouble and find another spot on Tuesdays - wings are probably just as good and the cost will be about the same too."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong enjoying the UFC on a warm summer night. An ice cold Raspberry Margarita to accompany a Chicken Dill burger & you'll be in 7th heaven."}
{"text":"They were short-staffed the last time I came here so it took almost two hours for our food to arrive. However, when our wings did arrive they were tasty and the manager gave us a deal because of the wait. 

The food and drinks were good and I didn't have any complaints besides the fact that they were a bit average. Servers and staff were helpful so I definitely wouldn't mind coming back here!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Thursday evening after work. Special s daily so we ordered a large poutine as part of a half off starters and sharables special. 

The fries aren't like any I've seen before.  Yummy as well with the cheese curds.  The gravy was OK, but had an odd flavour that i couldn't tell.  

The messy vegetarian burger I ordered also had a unique twist;  there was a mix of onions, jalapeño and some other flavour placed upon the melted cheese.  Very creative.  

Servers were attentive and nice.  A plus. 

Apparently the pork ribs were also noteworthy, though I was too full to take another bite.  

Glad I could wash it all down with my free refill of pop.

Decent place all in all.  Also conveniently located down the street from where I was working."}
{"text":"Came here for half price wings... Which I find their wings to be better quality compared to other wing places I've been to. Can't forget about the delicious garlic dill sauce. The service is good and the wait time isn't too long. The only negatives I can say and this applies to most St Louis locations is it is very cramped. Once you sit down, you are locked in. Don't even think about venturing to the washroom during half price wings night. Make sure you suck in your tummy after your meal to squeeze out between the tables."}
{"text":"Service was really good, the waitresses came by to check on us and refill any drinks we needed. Came here for 1/2 price wings on Tuesday, seated promptly and ordered quickly. Food came in a reasonable time, the only negative I dislike about this location is the seating arrangements are very cramped. Especially during the winter when everyone has giant parkas/jackets on it's hard to leave on the back of your chairs. I kept my jacket on the whole time and only had my purse at the back of my chair, at one point it was so cramped that when the waitress tried to squeeze between the tables/chairs she knocked off my purse. (that is how crowded it can get). Loved the food and the service just dislike the seating arrangement."}
{"text":"I can't say this location really stands out, it's very neutral. The service was ok, I had to ask/remind a couple of times for some things. The food is standard to all of the other locations I've visited, so flavour/quality is across the board. I feel like the servers like to focus on tables/groups that they prefer. We didn't really get any refills or anyone coming by to ask us about anything else we needed. I would definitely recommend their new lunch menu. However, I have to say their portions were okay for the lunch menu, but for the price you can't really complain."}
{"text":"Came on Wednesday. Their daily special was a $5 angus burger with fries, if you bought a large drink. Apparently, a large drink is any drink on their menu. They don't have a non-alcoholic drink menu on paper, but the waitress was more than willing to let me know what they had (although she didn't tell me the prices). Ended up getting an iced tea.

The iced tea costed $2.99? Something like that. Not from a can. Fountain. Slightly watered down, although that might have been my ice melting.

The angus burger and fries were a steal at $5. The burger was juicy and came with lettuce, tomatoes, pickle, red onion on a fairly nice bun. The fries were crispy, almost like a thick, crinkle cut chip. The burger didn't come with any sauces, but there's ketchup at the table.

No complaints for my $8 something meal, but if it weren't a special, I don't know whether I'd go or not. Service is slow at times, and the restaurant is surprisingly small and cramped (my first time at any of their locations). Since it's so close though, I'll probably come again."}
{"text":"Just a typical sports bar with nothing special and the wings were not good. But at least the service was ok with a friendly attentive waitress."}
{"text":"The food was great but for a Sunday evening the service was awful. Took about 15 minutes to get our drinks and the bartender did not know how to pour a beer. Tried once and too much foam and tried to scoop it out with a spoon; gave up and tried pouring a second beer and same thing happened."}
{"text":"The wings and fries are good. I found the wings are bigger than some locations. Overall good experience. Although the soft drinks are a bit bland..."}
{"text":"I go here on Tuesday's for their wings special, and I'll forewarn everyone that expect a wait as the lines get long. WIth that said, I enjoy the wings here a lot. I've gone to Allstars, Duff's, Wild Wing, and find that St Louis wings are what I'm craving more than the others."}
{"text":"I love most St.Luis location but this location was sadly the worst I ever went and the staff was so rude to me when we visit the store!"}
{"text":"This place gets really busy during the lunch time. I work very close, so we go there for group lunches. It's easy to make reservations and they call to confirm it with you a day before, which is a nice reminder. They can accommodate under 20 people I believe, so we never had issues with not sitting together. The food portion is good and the quality is not bad at all. The only thing you need to pay attention is some of their specials are not cheaper. We noticed that when we went there last time. Do the math and you will know they are trying to rip you off by telling you it's a deal. Other than that it's a nice place to have lunches with your coworkers."}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about, just needed some wings"}
{"text":"After having some positive experiences of the downtown location (college and Clinton) I decided to give this place a try. I arrived on Sunday August 30, 2014 at 8:30 pm and ordered the Sunday special a pint of wings with a domestic pint. The service was good. Amanda was attentive to me. The food was something  else. 
The chicken wings I received were perhaps the smallest ones I have ever seen. They were no longer than one inch in length and a half inch in diameter. In comparison to the downtown location they were less than half the size. The surrounding restaurants like Kelseys, Moxies, and All Stars had much bigger wings. I counted 7 wings in total. There couldn't be more than half a pound of wings in total.  I ended up hungry after my meal. 
In terms of the taste of the wings I ordered hotter than hell. There was no sauce on them. It was very mild. There were no veggies but the fries were pretty good. 

Although I  ordered the Sunday special it was very expensive. I wouldn't expect to pay more than six dollars for the wings. I have eaten wings at restaurants at half price specials and the wings there are more substantial. 
I would not recommend anyone to eat  here. There are much better places in the area."}
{"text":"Just same as other St. Louis Bar and Grill locations, this location is also really packed on Tuesday. I go this place for theirs wings night just like so many ppl. The reason I love this place is their service.  Most of sports bar and pubs has waitress and It's pretty rare that this place has waiters at night time. Servers are very kind and cheerful when you asked something for them. I always ended up giving more amount of tips I used to give to other place to appreciate their kind service."}
{"text":"Great service, food and overall a solid 4star. We came here on a rainy night and very glad we chose this place vs the others in the area. Its good for wings and general pub food.

Food: 4/5, I got the Mississippi BBQ sauce which is a speciality at this location as recommended by the server. It was tasty and the fries were good too. I only wish it came with celery or some veggie sticks.

Service: 4.5/5, excellent. She came by often to check on us and offered recommendations on sauces and just very pleasant.

Ambience: 4/5, small but good seating and a good place for conversations.

Price: 3/5, average around $18 per person."}
{"text":"food is alright, experience not too great.

Hostess was super attitute-y. She didnt want to seat us, started arguing and making snappy comments. wow, way to ruin someone's dinner."}
{"text":"Tuesday, half price wings with a pitcher of beer. What's not to like! :)

altho... the price of wings and beer is getting a bit steep these days. holy inflation!"}
{"text":"one of the best st louis wings places.

go on tuesdays, get a beer, wings are half price!!! i like cajun, hot, and original buffalo. first floor gets packed quick, so go upstairs, the music is better and you can actually get a table pretty quick. love it!"}
{"text":"always love st louis on tuesdays for obvious reasons!

highlight of the visit: we saw a giant raccoon walk on the fence, we had a good 15sec eye contact and he walked away. awesome! i wish i took a picture of him."}
{"text":"same old st louis stuff, longer wait, more expensive beer, mediocre service... I don't like they change of price in this location - i feel very cheated! being a loyal st louis fan for years and they dare to charge 20 dollars for a pitcher of millstreet organic??? please! not coming here again!"}
{"text":"Ugh. It's hard to mess up beer and wings, yet this place succeeded in doing so, quite spectacularly. 

Probably the worst wings I ever had, with beer from the bottom of the barrel. 

The ambience is nice, but I went there to eat, so won't repeat, under any circumstances. 

This place does a disservice to the St Louis brand name, as it's just incomparable to the other ones I've tried."}
{"text":"Solid place in markham. I used to come here a lot.. like *omg gain 40lbs in 2 years a lot* omg I was obsessed. This place and I were serious bffs. Nowadays, I visit probably once every few months, for the sake of my own health. 

This location is one of my favourites, because all the servers are extremely sweet and attentive 99% of the time. I've never had a problem here, even when it's super busy. The menu is hit and miss; they have great deals daily but some of the food, you just don't want to go near. I enjoy the wings a lot, and I always get the heavy garlic parm sauce.. oh goodness, my mind says yes but my arteries say no. It also comes with the fries, which are bomb af. Dip those in the garlic dill sauce and damn! Do you see why I can't come here more than once a few months? I'd seriously be 400lbs. I only get the wings here, but my friends get the other stuff, which I wouldn't be a big fan of. One friend had a sandwich and got diarrhea for a day, while another had a burger another time and had a stomachache. Surely it's not consistent, but it's enough to let me not order any burgers/sandwiches. 

I noticed that they've added new things to the menu, which is interesting. There are now chicken and waffles at st. Louis?! What?! It's like a burger, but the fried chicken is sandwiched with 2 waffles. My friend said it was pretty good! They also have this bowl in a deep-fried tortilla shell, which my other friend claimed to be a 0/10? It was a small portion of sad leaves, veggies and chicken inside a greasy bowl that reminds me of a nightmare from dim sum. The pic looks amazing but DON'T let it fool you.

Overall, it's not a bad place and I'd definitely be back for the wings and ice cold beer."}
{"text":"I went here the other day for some much-needed wings after a long day at work, and boy did they hit the spot. 

This is a great place to go before or after you hit up a game at the Skydome - it's right across the street and has huge TVs of all every sporting event, in case you don't have tickets. 

The wings were great - 9 wings and friends for about $10, which is pretty standard. The wings weren't the saucy kind but the dry kind which aren't my favourite but these were pretty tasty. The fries are the crinkled beefeater kind which are soo yummy and a great companion to the wings. They come with this delicious special sauce that I couldn't stop dunking the wings in! I wish it had been 10 wings instead of nine cause I was still pretty hungry after my meal. 

The service was great - beer refills were frequent and our waitress was very polite and attentive. The other thing was the music - they had a great playlist going of old favourites which was a nice addition to the meal. 

If you need a place to a quick and tasty bite when you're near the skydome, this is it!"}
{"text":"ordered 2LBS of wings, which were either overcooked, or, not cooked at all.  brutal.

bit into one very crispy wing, which was raw in the middle.  it ended-up in my napkin but i still got food poisining.

just a quick review to say thanks st. louis bar & grill, and, to warn others.  definitely pass.  you can get much better food elsewhere."}
{"text":"I came here for the $16.99 all you can eat boneless chicken wings with my family.  

I ordered the ayce wings and my family ordered individual entries.  We ordered the following:

- boneless chicken wings
- onion soup
- quesadillas (chicken)
- 2 baskets of chicekns wings
- buffalo chicken poutine
- one order of ayce

The quesadilla is a miss for me.  It was not that flavourful.  The fries that came with the chicken do not disappoint.  

If there is one item I would definitely recommend, it is the buffalo chicken wings poutine.  The portions is fairly big and if you were to eat it on your own it could fill up an average size individual.

With the ayce boneless chicken, it is expensive to get.  You have to order a large drink and this takes your bill to over $22 + tax, when you can order an entree and appetizers for around $15 and be full.  

As for the service, it took us 20 mins to be seated and it felt like the waitor were taking their time to seat us (mind you, we did come on a Friday night).

Overall, it is worth checking out if you have a poutine craving, but for chicekns wings... You are better off going to wild Wings or all star wings for their variety."}
{"text":"Only if I can give this location a half star I wouldn't give it one. The food is horrible. Got wings and poutine for three ppl. The waitress brought us one fork and told us that they are low on cutleries because it's almost closing time. They are close at 12 but we are there at 10... then the poutine came and it's not hot at all, the cheese curd didn't melt. The wings are so dry. I can actually taste the old oil. The fries is crispy but greasy. Except the beer tastes like beer, I didn't enjoy anything. The dill sauce is half size if the one we had before. Everything at this place is discounted. From food to service. Would never go back there."}
{"text":"A popular place for watching sports and for getting your chicken wings fix. It's not a huge place so it does get quite busy and sometimes there are long lineups. Considering it's just right outside Fairview Mall, it draws quite the crowd. I've been coming here several times for the wings and it's great to get after watching movies at Fairview. You can never go wrong coming here to enjoy some delicious wings. Every day of the week, they do have food and drink specials. Tuesday is always half-price wings so it gets quite busy here and even busier on game days so there can long wait times. They still had the all you can chicken bites special for the month of January so we came here for that special. It's $16.99 with a purchase of a drink and you can get a different flavour of chicken bites every round. Each round comes with fries and dipping sauce. I choose Garlic Parm, Mississippi Hot Honey and Honey Garlic. The Mississippi Hot Honey was my favorite one as it wasn't too saucy nor spicy. It was simply just right. Our server Jessica was super friendly and nice. She kept checking us to make sure if we needed another round of the chicken bites. Overall, a very good place to get wings. Will definitely be a regular customer here!"}
{"text":"Before I explain how trash my experience was, I got an all you can eat wing - boneless ($19.99 with purchase of drink). So, this place is honestly garbage. Their wings are vile. Unless you want the roof of your mouth bleeding and scarred from how dry the wings are, then this is the place to be. They claim the \"sauciest\" wings but thats actually laughable, they put 3 lines of the sauce ON TOP of the wings, THEY DON'T EVEN TOSS IT, they legit don't even TRY to make it look saucy, I asked for extra sauce on the side because my wings had no sauce and she gave it to me, just to then tell me an hour later that they charge for extra sauce, I told her I'm not paying for it. Even with the extra sauce, my gums are ripped up from how dry the wings are, my jaw literally hurts from all the chewing and tearing I had to do. Not only that, the wings took long. The server was extremely rude, she was a girl in blonde dreads, if you have her as a server, good luck. When I received my second batch of wings I told her there is no sauce, she tried to tell me that thats how much they give. I honestly told her theres no sauce on half of my wings.... and she rolled her eyes and snatched it back, almost spilling stuff on our table. 

So if you go here, you get trash food, trash service, and trash prices. Also, I've had their burgers here too and they are garbage as well, don't bother. Overall, DO NOT COME HERE.

GO TO ALL STAR WINGS, DO NOT GO HERE FOR WINGS! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! SAVE YOUR MOUTH FROM BLEEDING!"}
{"text":"It's just over rated! Small size wings, bad service,.. bartender and the manager needs to get a room instead of making out in public."}
{"text":"While visiting Toronto, ON  Canada this year for Supercross, my friends and I had lunch at this St. Louis Bar & grill.  The place has a devilish theme to it and is suppose to have crazy hot wings.  I didn't get any, but had myself a good bbq chicken sandwich.  It was very tasty and would recommend.  The sauces are really good, but not as spicy as I thought they would be.  
Being right next to the Rogers Center, it is a convenient stop if you are in the area for a Baseball game or any other sporting event."}
{"text":"Terrible service, waitress took a long time to bring menus, drinks, check. We had to ask for refills on water and the other tables we're cleared after people finished dining. I wouldn't go back to a place where I had to ask for silverware! Don't go!"}
{"text":"I will not be back. After giving them three chances, they've screwed up all three times.

And guess what? Their ribs are terrible! They don't fall off the bone, in fact you have to rip it off and chew through. I don't understand why they're marketing their ribs, they are absolutely not worth the price.

Their wings are good though - but the service has turned me off so badly that I cannot even be bothered to contact the manager.

Just know this - I gave this place three chances, the first time, our server took down the wrong order, blamed us, ROLLED HER EYES at us and argued with us. Who does that?

The second time, we got her AGAIN. She screwed up our order AGAIN. I was livid but decided not to let a dumbass stranger ruin my night so I didn't bother informing her like I did the first time.

The third time we got an older server who screwed up our order, never apologized. 

I'm so done with this place - I don't care how good your wings are, if you have bad customer service you are screwed."}
{"text":"There's lots of Louis wings joints around the city...and they're probably okay. But I really like the outdoor patio on Yonge. I've been here 5 or 6 times and love it...nice staff and chilled out vibe. An easy spot to while away a few hours in the sun over a decently priced beer. 

The poutine here is excellent: with the pork variety just tipping the fried chicken. The burgers are good too: keep in mind, eating in Louis' is a carb fest."}
{"text":"The wings seem a little too greasy/deadly, but their chili is out of this world awesome! It fills me right up and goes great with a beer. The servers are very nice and the atmosphere is pleasant."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for wings. You have bajillion choices of flavours for wings and they are for the most part tasty and not too fatty (especially for the dry rub ones). Im a huge huge huge fan of their fries (think thick, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside) and their dill dipping sauce is amazing! 2 pounds (16 wings roughly) is roughly enough for two to share and you can ask them to do two different flavours!"}
{"text":"4:30pm on a quiet Saturday. Barely anyone here yet. Sounds like service might be good right ? WRONG.

After being seated, patiently waiting for the waitress to finish braiding their hair in this empty resturant. 

15 minutes later no one had yet even asked if I wanted water. INSTEAD. The waitress got a drink for herself and seated herself at a table. 

NICE. That drink looks mighty tasty.

5 minutes later. I got up and left.

Tl:Dr.  Service sucks."}
{"text":"Had the AYCE boneless wings (Until end of Jan; $16.99 but you have to buy a large drink, so $19.99 with a soft drink.) The wings come with nice thick crinkle cut fries. 

Tried the honey garlic, garlic parmesan, chili lime, hot honey, sweet Thai bbq, authentic buffalo, and Mississippi honey bbq (We were a large group so we had many opportunities to share our selections.) The top flavours were honey garlic, sweet Thai bbq, and Mississippi honey bbq. 

Their dry rubs didn't taste great and I suspect it's because their base breading isn't the best. The taste of grease is really prominent without all the sauce to mask it. 

The service was great; our server was friendly and efficient.

Overall, the taste was just average. If you're craving to be wings stuffs then take advantage of this deal while it lasts. I don't think I'd come back here though; for $19.99 I'd rather have lunch sushi buff."}
{"text":"I like wings. I especially like the wings at the Bistro and thetefore at most of the St Louie locations. However our recent experience was poor. Visited at about 10pm the other night. The place was about half full. The waitress took our orders which were pretty  simple. But she got them wrong. The wings were crispy but very small in size and without any spice. I got fries I didn't order. Disappointing! I won't go back to this location."}
{"text":"Good value. Hadb special sat nite
Full rack for 14.99. Want better ? Don't whine!
Goto the keg at Yonge/eg. Pay double 
and you will get better
Oh yeah!
Ps waiter let me test drive a new beer 
Good dude!
Service superb!"}
{"text":"I usually don't write reviews, but I recently had a terrible experience. I went there with my pregnant wife and we asked for a booth, the hostess said they didn't have any available and brought us to a little table that didn't provide enough room. I looked around and noticed 2 booths available, I asked the hostess and she said it's against company policy to seat us at either booth. Pretty terrible way to treat a guest, let alone a pregnant one. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET CURSED BY THE OWNER/MANAGER!

Saturday + wingsanity + hockey night = tons of people,  that's why I made reservation few days head just to make sure we don't need to wait for a long time.  I got into the restaurant right on time (8:30pm), the place was packed with many people. I was told by the manager or owner the table that reserved for us has been sitting there for 1.5hours & they should be leaving soon. 

At around 8:45, another group of 7 people were complaning to the manager that they've been waiting for 30mins.  The manager explained \"the group with reservation will get the table first (which is me).\" 5 minutes later,  he came up and asked if all my friends are here yet,  I told him my friend is just downstairs parking and will be here shortly. Right after I said that, I saw the group who complained earlier got seated. Errr...ok?  Shouldn't I get the table first? So I asked him again,  he said should be another 10 minutes. 

Another 30 mintues passed, my friends and I were still waiting!!!  We made a reservation, wait for an hour,  still no seat?  The restaurant was so small, we were all standing in front of washroom. I was really mad about it so when the manager told me to wait for another 5mintues, I asked him to give me an exact time on when we can get seated.  

That's when the manager (or owner) started to argue with me.  He said the people who sat for more than 1.5hours aren't leaving and there is nothing he can do about it.  He also mentioned they never have a group of 8 people coming in to eat. (so it's my fault for bringing that many people to pay to eat in his restaurant?)

The manager told us we are more than welcomed to leave. All of a sudden he said we were swearing (?) and he could ban us from going there again.  My friend then started arguing with him, he said \"dllm\" in Chinese (which means f your mother) to us and acted like he wanted to hit us.  In the end,  we all left with disappointment: tired and hungry from standing for an hour. When we left,  I saw at least 10 people waiting because the manager kept taking in their names without telling them how long they have to wait. 

Never had these kind of services before.  Couldn't believe my first review on yelp is about this unpleasant experience. 

(now that I am on yelp I see that this location of St. Louis is only 2.5 stars,  why didn't I check earlier?  Argh! )"}
{"text":"Lots of sports playing on large screen TVs, would have preferred some news instead. Wings were okay. Sweet potato fries simply delicious. Design your own poutine was quite good. All portions were on the large size."}
{"text":"Tired, napkin free and effort free. Once there was a time where folks did not have to ask for a napkin. Now, when my buddy asked for one, I had to be asked if I needed one as well. Does the manager tell them the cost of napkins? 

My kid enjoyed his meal. And I enjoyed the new chicken sandwich. The seats are a bit crowded and I am glad the business is performing."}
{"text":"I frequent the St Louis Bar and Grill once a month on my business trips to Markham.  It is a nice change of pace from the hotel bar next door, but it's best to come with little to no expectations of service.  50% of the time I am there it takes over 15 minutes to even get a drink order in, much less a menu.  I think a lot of the service issues are with the personnel.  If you walk in the door and Aida (Sp?) is not working, get ready to be there for 2 hours if you want 2 beers and an entree.  If Aida is working you could be in and out in 30 minutes.  There are quite a few large screen TV's that play a variety of sporting events each night.  If there is any sporting event not on basic cable and you are staying at the Hilton next door, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Allstar wings is much better. But the service here is decent. Except they have very inappropriate conversations and degrading woman. They talk about divorce and dead beat husbands. That's not what I want to hear when I eat."}
{"text":"So went here for the Wednesday deals, Burger and fries for $5, also beer same price. Found the burger and fries pretty typical pub style. Nothing special but for the price why not."}
{"text":"This place has never let me down.  The wide variety of wings are always smokin' hot, with flavourful coatings, crispy on the outside, and juicy on the inside.  But when you don't want a load of wings with the big basket of Beefeater fries, there are options.

First, check out the daily specials.  You will usually find a nice surprise.  If not, the regular menu doesn't stray too far from the middle of the bar food road, but the Asian Tacos are excellent.  A bit spicy, smooth, crisp and chewy all at the same time, its more fun than is allowed by law.

BTW, plan to get messy.  The sauce makes its way around your paws.  And if this a date night, consider licking each other's fingers ;-)"}
{"text":"Some many good wing joints, and this is trailing the pack.  These wings looked quite anorexic. At least you are buying by the pound, so you just have to contend with paying for a lot more bones.

I had the Lemon Pepper wings, which turned out overcooked, dark and crisp on the outside, and still had a little moisture left inside.  It's been a while since I was in a St Louis', so I'm not sure if it is just this location, or if they are all moving to mini wings..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai Lettuce wrap. flavour was nice, but served slightly warm in a cast iron skillet. So temperature was disappointing.

And yes..... I was sick for 3 days after this.... One of many cases of salmonella

{"text":"Love having one close to me, don't love the service that night.  The 3 I gave is very respectable though.  

Came here after a softball game to grab some dins and check out the Jays game (how did we lose in 17 innings?)  Now the service was up to par but my friend's girlfriend is lactose and ordered the fish tacos and asked for no mayo....she got mayo....and waited 20-25 mins for her food after she had to bring it back.  We all finished our food before she got hers BUT they did save it by paying for her dinner...good call for sure  That was the only problem unfortunately it was a noticable one.  

I've been here a few times and will come back.  I like this place and I think the set up is awesome especially for a summer pint...yum"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. They turned away two friends and I because we couldn't provide driver's licences as ID even though we had other forms of ID. The place was dead and they definitely had space to seat us. I'm very upset because the hostess who turned us away was especially rude as soon as we walked through the doors."}
{"text":"Calamari was good, if it was up to us it could of been crispier but was just fine how it was, wings and fries we're good as usual from st louis, the bar was packed and the younger blonde girl still gave us great service, this was on a tuesday night for the TFC game and we expected at least some wait for the drinks because of how busy it was but she was awesome and quick, we weren't planning on yelping or else we should of got her name. The food was also quick, the st louis in the beaches was alot slower, the atmosphere here was way better too will be going back for more games."}
{"text":"Ordered take out during dinner time today . Took about 15 min for my order which is pretty fast considering I'm only in my 30 min break. The fries are my favourite and the server was really friendly . The score cost me about $12 after tax . U can choose any sauce u like ( I picked honey garlic) . The bar has many selection of alcoholic drinks . Today is a perfect day for a patio weather if u want to enjoy the scenery while eating."}
{"text":"The service yesterday night was a bit slow despite there wasn't a lot of customers. I came here for the food of coarse. The garlic Parmesan wings and fries was my usually order . The quality of the fries and wings never disappoint. Their garlic dill special sauce that comes with it was the best and u can't get it anywhere. Taste even better if its dipped in with their special fries."}
{"text":"St Louis is known for great wings and great fries -- and their addictive dill dip.

Service is friendly and they have daily specials on weekdays.

We sat outside on the patio with the kids.  They have an affordable kids menu and I'd recommend the chicken tenders for the kids or yourself.

I never have a problem finding parking in this plaza which includes a McDonald's and Magic Noodles.

I have not come on a night where there's a game playing on TV -- so I can't speak to how service or food quality may be impacted on a busy night.

All I know is that I will come here if I ever need to get my wing and fries fix."}
{"text":"After going a bunch of times for Tuesday wing night(mainly for the fries), I finally decided to switch it up and try the chicken and waffles!!! 4.5/5! Would definitely get again!

First off, it comes with sweet potato fries, which is already a game changer when you don't have to pay extra for it! Next up, the sauce with the waffles is just delicious! Crunchy while still soft in the middle! Finally the chicken! It's pretty much the chicken tenders drizzled in sauce which just makes it all the better! 

Would give it a shot if I were you! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is the worst St.Louis I've been to quality wise. The portions are so small. Every other location I've been to does 5 wings as a half pound but this location does 4 wings. Also the wings poutine I got had maybe 5 tiny pieces of chicken in it. Their wings were also served cold with hardly any sauce on them and we had to ask for dip for our fries. I don't feel like this location is nearly as good as the other locations which are amazing because their portions are so much smaller."}
{"text":"Used to LOVE this place based on my past review..but then I came by with my sister two weeks ago on a Saturday and have had a huge change of mind. We ordered 2LBs of wings and received our 2lbs of wings with 12 french fries..it was so disappointing. When I asked the bartender about it who was bussing food to tables he said \"that's what you get with the 2lbs of wings..\" even though he saw how sad it looked..we were better off ordering a 1lb each and receiving more fries. Our waitress also came by our table while we were eating and let us know about an autism campaign St.Louis was taking part in and asked us how much we wanted to donate in which we ended up donating $10..little did I know when I got home and went on Twitter that it was a $2 per puzzle piece campaign. This really upset me...

I won't be coming back to this place, their lack of customer service and ripping off their customers is sad.."}
{"text":"Staying at a local hotel went over on a Saturday night to watch some games.. Owners are very welcoming and Staff/ cute girls were very helpful. Wings are good here!!!"}
{"text":"A nice place to watch the game; they have quite a few screens available. The food is pretty standard bar food, no surprises there. The service seems prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Came in at the end of the night for some poutine and beer. Both were not bad but really, the poutine would not have been as enjoyable had we not been drinking I'd expect.

Service was alright. They were not thrilled to have people walk in just before close though it seemed. Oh well.

The place itself was super funky - and not in a good way. Lots of douch-baggy guys up front with way too much cheap cologne on. No air flow whatsoever... seriously... it's summer! If you are going to cheap out and not use air conditioning, at least make sure you have the windows and doors open and invest in some fans!

I can't imagine coming back here - and really the only reason that I did this time was that my drunk friend was INSANE for a poutine and it was the only place around that made them and whose kitchen was still open."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different St. Louis locations in the GTA and I find this one to be one of the better ones overall. The service is pretty good and the food is delivered to the table quickly and accurately.

My girlfriend and I like to come here on Tuesdays for the wings special (1/2 price wings!) The flavour ranges offered on the menu satisfy pretty much any spice craving one could have with chicken wings. The fries of all things are the best though and you have to get their signature dill pickle sauce to dip them (and the wings) in.

Price-wise this location is the same as all the others but I find the drink prices a tad lower than some of the locations closer to downtown. The location is also very convenient as a good spot to go after shopping at STC next door. Overall, this is a good spot for beer and wings and definitely worth checking out on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"I love st louis fries who wouldnt :)))) right?? But honestly, out of all of the locations this is the coooolest one.  I LOVE THE PATIO specially in summer. Unfortunately, the line up is huge but moves pretty quick. Once you dine out ( take patio) u will never go to other locations."}
{"text":"I believe they should close down this location. Friendly staff horrible manager. I was there a week ago and i will never ever go back again."}
{"text":"St. Louis is one of the best places to get wings in town. Tuesdays are half price to the deal is remarkable. My favorite is the dry cajun but garlic parm is also very good. The dill dipping sauce is a fantastic accompaniment and the fries are amazing!

This location is ok accommodating requests like all drums or all flats, unlike some others. Well done BCC location!"}
{"text":"The wings are their usual great but this location is unwilling to accommodate requests for all flats or all drums, even at a charge. Saying NO to a customer request without being willing to accommodate even with a fee is a non-starter for me. Go to the Bramalea City Centre location instead."}
{"text":"This was the first St. Louis location that I ever went to. As a former Arby's (if I recall correctly) it's not really built like your average bar but certainly did the job. Their famous wings grabbed me that day and have had me ever since. Particularly the dry cajun. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"I came here to grab some dinner. We had to wait 30 minutes to be seated and they called us when our table was really instead of buzzers. I thought buzzers would of been better than a phone call. However, we sat on the outside and it was nice to sit outside. The waitress was sweet and we ordered a pitcher of shocktop. It was so good and she brought us nice beer glasses. We ordered boneless and traditional wings which are half off on Tuesdays!!!! I highly recommend but on Tuesdays you have to wait!"}
{"text":"Ya just can't go wrong with St. Louis! 

I am a frequent visitor of this chain over others for their wings (Hot Sweet Asian what whattttt) and the infamous dill sauce that comes with their thick cut crispy fries (so delish).

Decided to visit this location on a Wednesday afternoon for their $5 Angus Burger special when my co-worker had a burger craving and was not disappointed! Asked for the Angus Burger with goat cheese and did not regret it one bit.

The melt-in-your-mouth texture of the goat cheese paired with the juicy beef patty was perfect. The special came with fries which were on point as always especially with the dill sauce and the server was even nice enough to waive the extra dill sauce charges as well as the requirement of having to purchase a beverage in order to get the special! Nothing like cheap, quality eats and good service to leave an impression.

PRO TIPS:

- Don't forget the dill sauce!
- Option to add 1/2 lb of wings to any order for $5-6
- Ask to have the special without buying a drink (if you don't want one)

{"text":"On a business trip in Toronto. Wanted a sports bar to watch World Series and Thursday night football. This fit the bill. Great Devils Caesar and  above average wings!  All apps were half price which was a nice bonus!"}
{"text":"Worst service. Bartender literally rolled her eyes because we sat at a table with one dirty glass. Then she said \"maybe you guys can wait next time before you sit\" it was the only free table."}
{"text":"I love this St. Louis.
Here are the main reasons:
1. The waitresses are so friendly and treat their patrons well
2. Feels like home
3. It is the right size, feels like a true \"local\"
4. Close to my house :-)
5. Wings are consistent 
6. Offer deals on some nights 
7. Busy, but not too busy
8. Open late

Did I mention the waitresses are great ?"}
{"text":"Wir waren sehr oft abends dort. Günstiges essen und Cocktails. 
Man kann dort Football und Baseball sehen und gemütlich an der Bar was essen und trinken. Ich habe jeden Besuch genossen"}
{"text":"Decided on a whim to finally check out this location with my new man. Was a bit disappointed they hadn't opened the patio yet because it was a lovely day to eat outside. Inside, there's a good sized bar space and in the dining area there are booths and tables to sit at. If youre with the guys/gals i would recommend sitting in the bar area where theres a better atmosphere and, I suspect, better service.

Our waitress was nearly useless in terms of notifying us of the daily special, soup, the drinks, the portion of the nachos and it took forever to get our bills. We definitely wont be back on the basis of the overall poor service. 

On the positive side, the Korean BBQ beef coleslaw sandwich and fries were really delicious...i didn't even need to use their special garlic dill dip but i recommend ordering the dip with your fries to have a fresh change from ketchup sometimes. today's soup was beef barley which was average as was the double amaretto sour however i was pleased they offered fresh options and could accommodate my off-menu drink request.

final tip - do not order the nachos here. they were pretty bad...happy i can always get great nachos at my joint fox n fiddle finch. hope the manager can fix the crappy service here because I'd like to come back to watch a game and taste the fajita tacos, fish tacos or one of their tempting burgers. 

ok last last tip i dont know if i should write this but the servers are pretty so i guess that could be a plus for those who appreciate that sort of thing."}
{"text":"I've been to a few St. Louis locations through my lifetime so I know a good one when I see one. Staff have got it right. Attentive service with a smile. Simple, no stress. Patty, my server, was delightful and the host and the other waitress working were all friendly. 

Lunch time is a little busy (very high-testosterone and currently very blue-jays-y) but it's a nice place to drop in with the fellas or the work-mates. Might as well catch a game while you're here! They've got the blue jays game playing on the tv's inside and blasting on the speakerphone out front!

 Booths inside look comfy but I enjoyed the patio outside (plenty of seating and enough spacing between tables that you can put your feet up!). 

I used the check-in to get the half-price app deal (sweet deal). I'm always a bit leery about ordering quesadillas at a franchise but hey, these turned out pretty good! Try the shredded beef quesadillas :) If you don't use yelp, you can get 50% off on appetizers after 4pm on Thursday or get a coupon by leaving your customer feedback on stlouiswings.com. Appetizers are pretty good so it's definitely worth checking out.

P.S. This location is smaller than some of the other locations but it makes up for it in quality of food and service. You might be able to fit a medium-sized group in there but I would suggesting calling well ahead of time to see how busy it is (not sure if they take reservations)."}
{"text":"We came here for another quick bite and ordered only Sweet Asian BBQ wings and St Louis nachos with beef.    The wings and fries are always on point.  specially those fries which are like crack to me, I could literally eat them every single day.   The nachos were very, very disappointing.  They were flavourless with very little toppings and the beef was dry and bland - I won't be ordering these again.  The pickled Caesar was deliciously amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it.   Oh and of course we ended the night with a few shots of Patrón lol

My 2 star rating is based solely on the nachos, not the establishment or the service."}
{"text":"Wings are good. Burgers are good. This is the only place that I could find close to me that showed the NFL package and also served good wings. The other St. Louis Bar and Grills don't have the NFL package so coming to this place was a no brainer on Sunday. They have a ton of tv's and show every game which is awesome. Will be coming back here in the future if I'm not back in the States for football."}
{"text":"There wings are the best at this location. The saucy wings are incredibly saucy, which is how it should be. It's a large and busy location with a good crowd. One of the best locations I could recommend if you wanna go to a St. Louis. Best to go when they have the wing special."}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype about St. Louis and their wings.. there's only 3 flavours, they're super small and not anything worth their price. If you don't go for the wings however this is a pretty nice sports bar to watch soccer / hockey games at and the servers are pretty friendly."}
{"text":"This is a very 'meh' place. At first I thought \"El Hornero\" would serve some sort of Spanish or Argentinian (judging by what is on the cover on their menu and staff) but nope, it's really just an Italian place in disguise. 

Prices are okay, around $11-14 for entree's, pasta's or pizza's. We tried their \"10 ounce\" steak with spaghetti which was a surprise being sold for $14 , and as it turns out it was too good to be true. I'd say mmaaybee it was a 4 ounce steak, but hey at least they gave us 10 ounces of spaghetti!

The chicken parmesan wasn't anything special either. The chicken breast was huge (and almost dry), and simply just grilled had a slice of processed cheese on top and some tomato sauce to give it some flavour. 

Their most decent thing was their pizza which they advertise from the outside (being on the wood burning oven). And given the price ($11-12) I can't really complain about it. It was a bit soggy near the centre but tasted pretty good.

Service was good but there is not anything here that will really get me to come back."}
{"text":"I have a great time when I come here. Food is amazing and drinks epic. They have daily meal specials for every day of the week and equally wonderful drinks specials. Staff are pleasant and helpful, atmosphere fun and friendly. Still need to work on cleanliness however, tables really need a good once over, just a hot wet cloth to get all those wing sauces out... clorox even? (Germaphobe, I know. lol)"}

the wings take about half hour to get to the table and so did the beer

when I went to the bar to complain that it was over 20 minutes that Ive been waiting for my beer I received attitude from the bartender and waitress"}
{"text":"St. Louis is nicely situated on Yonge north of Davisville. It has a great patio that always has a waiting list. The inside has lots of TVs, including a large-screen television, which strangely does not have any seating facing it. The menu features mainly wings and ribs. The wings were good, if a little oversauced, and the sauce I chose--hot and smoky--was as advertised. They have reasonable beer and wing combos, and the staff is friendly and young, and the female servers are all blonde and about twenty years old and, I think I can say, quite hot.

I'm scoring the restaurant two stars lower than I would have otherwise because the night my friends and I were there--a Friday night--a large contingent of rugrats, ages 3-12 or so, sat right behind us. Kids are kids, so I wasn't surprised that they were somewhat noisy, but I was surprised that these kids would be in a bar at 9 o'clock on a Friday. They bumped into me several times. They had the run of the place, playing tag, kicking the walls and furniture, shouting and rolling on the floor. The parents watched on and even encouraged them, which to me makes them not only poor parents but morons. The staff did nothing to stop this behaviour and merely walked between the kids, smiling. I suspect the parents are regulars. We stayed because we had a full pitcher, but otherwise we would have settled up immediately and walked out.

I will go back, but I won't go again if there are kids there at night and I'll lower the rating to one star. It's a bar, people. The adults all around are drinking and using foul language and watching often violent sports on TV. Some of them are even on the make. Leave your kids at home or take them to McDonald's, or better yet, put them to bed at a reasonable hour or call a babysitter."}
{"text":"It's so bad it's insulting. Worst location ever. 

The things that went wrong could have been avoided so easily. A few more years and they might not be around. People have standards.

I am not bougie and I have very low expectations at any wing bar. All I ask for is a drink, basket of wings, napkins and maybe a plate for my bones. That's it. 

I came here on Tues Feb 27 @ 730pm for a birthday. There were 12 of us. 
-drinks took way too long, they didnt have clamato so I got the berry smash - it didnt have any berries in it like the picture had advertised.

-we had simple orders, some people got 2lbs and 2 flavours but when it came out they were mixed up. For example: person A: 2lbs honey garlic and garlic parm. Person B: dry cajun and sweet asian. When it came out honeygarlic was with dry cajun and sweet asian was with garlic parmesan.
- It also took the servers awhile to figure out what is what. Constantly leaving baskets at the end of our table, running back to the kitchen confused. They would tell us \"this is sweet asian\" when it wasn't and 1 girl said she read the slip wrong and it actually is what we ordered. All of this made our wings cold. Extremely unenjoyable experience. 

-in the end we were missing 1lb of hot and honey for the birthday boy which the server did eventually get for us. And we had 2lbs of wing flavours we did not order . We didnt want to eat it -they were cold.

-worst part was when 1lb of Sriracha wings came out but the server said \"hot & honey\" so the person who ordered hot &honey started eating it. Another girl came by with \"hot & honey\" We all looked puzzled . Then the first girl came back and told us \"oh the first basket wasnt hot &honey but actually sriracha\". So they switched it and handed it to the right person BUT the person with the first basket is now missing 2 wings because the server told the other person it was theirs so they ate it. 

-the mistaken 2lbs were on our bill as well as the Caesar i had wanted previously.
- best part was when the server dropped off the plates she only gave us 8plates,8napkins,4 wetnaps and 1 fork for 12 people.

-when we would tell her about the wing mix up or ask her for our drinks again, or more napkins she happily got what we asked for. She also had a nonchalant attitude and it really seemed like it didnt phase her as if this always happens and shes so used to it. She was nice but being nice doesn't mean you gave good service.
-she was also bartending so maybe she was distracted.
-I truly believe that the downfall of that night was caused by the entire functionality of that restaurant and it is not solely anyone's fault.

These are simple things that shouldn't have gone wrong. It's so embarrassing for the st.louis brand.

I don't know if the mix up was because of the kitchen if the server punching in orders wrong. Either way we weren't too fussy but just left with a sour taste. My friends and I will never be back."}
{"text":"My gf and I came here on Tuesday night for the half price wings. We weren't served for like 15 minutes at the door and it wasn't even that busy. We had to sit ourselves at the bar later and the bartender was very welcoming and apologized for the service. 

As the offer on Tuesday, we got 2lb of original wings. It's fairly flexible when choosing the sauces. Wouldn't say the selection sauces is too wild but we can get all favorite ones here. The quality of wings is above average."}
{"text":"10 years ago this would be a 4 or 5 star for me.  Let me tell you why. 
St Louis wings has become famous for one thing.  Their ORIGINAL wings!!!  No batter, no sauce, no dusting, no grilling, no boneless.  There was ONE kind of wing.  You order it mild, medium or hot.  Now you walk in and the servers do not even know what their original wings are anymore.  Believe it or not, one was trying to tell me their breaded wings was the original one.  WHY WHY WHY change something that worked for 30 years?  I look at their menu now and its so confusing.  I ask the waitress to just give me a pound of medium the way they made them 20 years ago.  She brings me back breaded wings.  Are you serious?  Whoever is in charge in head office of these changes is seriously dumb. Their fries are not real fries.  Somehow after 1 week in your fridge they are still crispy.  I love them though.  The dill sauce is amazing.  I can drink it.  Very sad that a place that got famous for one thing and now you don't even know how to order it on a menu."}
{"text":"I normally don't enjoy visiting other St Louis locations, but I enjoy this location. 

St Louis is a great place to catch a sports game. I love the environment, it is relaxing and fun. Service is a hit or miss, but overall it is generally good. The wings are good and their Tuesday half-off special is a great deal. 

This location is a great place to have wings while watching a sports game."}
{"text":"I came in last week and ordered some boneless wings. I was not impressed. The wings tasted dry and old. It was okay, I never got sick. I recommend this restaurant to buy their meat from Wings Up in the West end of the GTA. They have the best and freshest wings.

Wings were served in a wicker basket, not on a plate. I felt like I was eating at a food truck. Food should be served on a plate please!

Staff were very friendly. Bathroom had pee on the floor."}
{"text":"Great Service! Great Meat. Fair prices. The french fries are not my favourite. It's not the chef, rather I don't like the recipe. Otherwise perfect scores!

PS- very busy on Tuesday's."}
{"text":"Overall: their staff have been inadequately trained regarding their customer service and smart serve training 

To begin, servers Nate and Hanna did as best they could. 

Spent the better part of the day with a friend to catch up. While we ate, drank and talked our server told us to slow down on drinks as we were going to get cut off.... We were having approx. one drink an hour with food.... Our server didn't want to cut us off (she knew we were fine) the bartender (Liz)  did, who had never met us.

 I approached her and she said it was from past patrons who had gotten into their cars after drinking there...neither of us had driven there... They lack the capacity to use their smart serve (I'm a bartender also) and intelligence; it was distasteful. 

Another friend who joined us also said he was cut off after a few beers within a respectable amount of time. 

The staff cannot defend their patrons with the bartender and at least the bartender Liz cannot adequately assess customers using her smart serve. She's overserved in the past and now does not adequately assess her new patrons. Franchise establishment or not their staff are not adequately trained."}
{"text":"Pros: nice staff, good service, amazing food, quesadillas, chicken fingers, good seating, lots of televisions to watch games

Cons: not vegan friendly, not too expensive but not too cheap either

Summary: A great place to watch the game and share some food with friends or family!"}
{"text":"+1 star for our great waitress Amanda. Attentive and noticed when napkins and water are running low. +1 star for the fries which were pretty consistent with other locations. But for the actual food just Nooooooo. The wings weren't covered with enough sauce at all, buffalo ranch tasted the same as garlic parm, and the wings were overfried and really dry. Would not come here at all anymore, one of the worst of this chain."}
{"text":"Decent place to go for drinks. Nothing too special, there is a wide variety around King/Yonge area - only come here if there is no other choice.

No offence to the servers - they are actually super nice and very welcoming. What I find is that there are other better deals around the area than 1/2 wings on Tuesdays.

The good itself is not too spectacular, good for the deals that they have.

My group and I came on a Tuesday for the 1/2 priced wings. They were okay - we also have to purchase a large drink/alcoholic drink for the wings. There is a vast number of different flavors, but in general, they are all salty.

Overall, it's a good space to catch up and grab drinks. But if you can snatch up a better spot/restaurant, I would totally recommend that instead."}
{"text":"Very small place, fits around 15 tables with a decent size patio that fits 5 tables.
We went on a Tuesday night for half price wings. The place was packed when we arrived around 10pm. Since it was so small, people were all waiting near the door making it extremely difficult just to walk inside. They have no hostess stand so we had to walk and look around to see if anyone can take down our name for a table. It was extremely unorganized and we ended up noticing a clipboard near the edge of the bar where we waited for a server to take our name. The patio was empty as we entered the bar at first and after we waited for an hour, the host walks around asking people who were waiting if anyone would like a patio seat. If they did then they can get served right away. Why didn't the host ask when she took names down? We didn't care where we were sitting in the first place so why did we have to wait an hour for seats which were opened all along?!?

Very poor staff training because she clearly looks lost and doesn't know how to deal with high volume of customers. As we sat down, our server never came and after waiting for 20mins the host comes along and asks if she can grab us our drinks. We placed our order with her because we didn't want to wait any longer. As soon as we placed our order, the server comes out and asks if we want to move inside. We did because we thought we would get more customer service inside rather than feeling abandoned outside.

We order a pint of Richard's Red and 2lbs of wings, half maple vindaloo and half garlic parm.
The beer was 75% full with no foam or whatsoever on top, so I wasn't too impressed, but I thought it wasn't a big deal so we didn't question about it. We got our food shortly after we got our drinks so thank god it wasn't another long wait. 

The wings came with garlic dip and fries. The fries were hot and crispy which I couldn't stop eating. The wings were just OKAY, a little over fried because of the dryness in the meat but with the price that we're paying and the environment that we were in, there's not much to complain. The garlic parm sauce tasted good but a bit disappointed with the maple vindaloo. Since the vindaloo sauce was new on the menu, allowance was given for them to make changes.

Overall food was OKAY, service definiately needs improvement! Our server NEVER came up to check up on us after we got our drinks and food. The whole night I only saw her once come to our table, actually it was 2. First time to give us our drinks, second time was the bill. She never even introduced herself with her name as our server.

Only time I would come back is if there's a special, besides that, there's many other great choices nearby."}
{"text":"I came here in the summer twice and sat on the patio and we really enjoyed it, the lady who served us was really friendly and nice and the food was pretty good.
I came here again in the spring and it just was not the same.. The dining room is so unattractive and not welcoming. Half of my food was cold and I did not enjoy it at all. 
My sister in-law got quesadillas but then when she turned them over they were extremely burnt. Obviously the chef knew he did something wrong because he turned them over.. We told the waitress and she was mad at US for some reason! We asked if we can get the quesadilla off the bill and she called us difficult?
The waitress had an attitude with us as soon as we walked in, she didn't have a note pad so in the middle of our ordering she left to tell the chef what to make, very bad service too. If she doesn't like her job then she shouldn't work there."}
{"text":"I went to this place with one of my friends that lived here for several years, actually it's cool sport bar but not for weekend cause you've to wait 40-50 mins !!!
The wings are good but the dip is awesome.
Also I've tried their rib, that's Ok but not as you expect to get in states."}
{"text":"Went for half price wings recently. The food was decent, but the service is atrocious. We ordered our first set of wings to eat in the restaurant and another set to take away. But the waitresses were all rude when you order water instead of a drink and try to deny your take away wings with half price wings, even though you can just order a dine-in set and then get a take away container. 

Honestly not worth the 30 min lineup and having deal with waitresses frowning at you when serving you. Management probably needs to change policies too because if you try to come up with this many restrictions, it's not worth people's time to just enjoy white people food."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends to watch the game on a Saturday night. 

The place was packed and they have enough TVs that you can see the game from almost any angle you sit which is great.

We got the wings and fries which were typical bar food, nothing special. Same with the drinks. Its a typical sport bar but it does get very busy."}
{"text":"St. Louis Bar and Grill is one of the few chains that I actually quite enjoy. The St Louis Bar here has an old school pub feel to it. It's never been extremely crowded every time I've gone, but it's just loud enough to enjoy a game (in particular, the Game 7 between the Raptors and Nets). The place has 2 floors and a patio in case it starts getting all claustrophobic up in there.

Ordered wings as a group and had the Garlic Dill Chicken Sandwich. The Wings are pretty good. They aren't the largest, but they were naked wings tossed in a good amount of sauce. i had the authentic buffalo which wasn't really spicy at all. The chicken wings were done very well and it comes with steak fries which are oddly good at scooping up that dill sauce that St. Louis is apparently famous for. 

The Garlic Dill Chicken Sandwich ($12.99) is breaded chicken breast tossed in hot sauce. Then it's sandwiched betwen a brioche bun with cheddar cheese, bacon, onion straws, lettuce, tomato, and garlic dill sauce. The sandwich is pretty tall so it's a challenge to eat, but it's an impressive sight. The chicken was a bit small but the rest of the ingredients meshed together still made for a pretty good sandwich.

Great place with a good atmosphere. Did I mention the waitresses were pretty hot? I know that's what most of these places are trying to do, but St. Louis accomplished it. Parking here can be a pain as it can fill up rather quickly, but there are lots everywhere, especially on the weekends. Definitely would rather come here than other bars and pubs in the area."}
{"text":"The overall place is nice cozy and simple. I'm new here and they make me feel comfortable. The one thing I'm not comfortable with is one waitress who likes to wear skirts that are just a little too short."}
{"text":"Cheap food. Cheap beer. Eye candy service. Good. High douche bag customer factor. Bad."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tuesday night for their half price wings. Holy moly it was packed! We Asians take our wings seriously :)

Anyway, I had the combo Cajun boneless and salt & pepper traditional wings. It came fairly quickly considering how busy they were. The wings were crispy and good. I quite enjoyed my half priced wings. For my next visit, I'll just stick with traditional wings, it's more fun albeit more work."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in the afternoon for some lunch and catch up session. We ordered poutine, wings and chicken waffles. 

The chicken wings were delicious and the poutine was a little too salty. Chicken waffles? Waffles were very sweet and chicken was good but the sauce was a quite spicy. Maybe sauce on the side would be nice but maybe it compliments the sweet waffle - idk. 

Service on the other hand, some might like it but I don't. The waitress kept checking up on us every 5-10 minutes which was pretty overwhelming. We were there for about an hour and imagine how many times we were asked if \"everything's okay?\""}
{"text":"I went there for lunch on a weekday, and their steak sandwich with fries was pretty good. The flavours were right, and nothing was burnt/overcooked (which happens sometimes at grill restaurants). The price for such a meal is about $16 including tax and tips.

Mysteriously I wasn't given the napkin+fork+knife package when my food was served. I had to explicitly ask for it, which I found quite odd because I'm fairly sure it's standard to receive this. However I forgive this oversight and won't deduct a star(*) because the waitress was fast and response, and the food was tasty.

(* Note: My standard rating is 4 stars, not 5. Only very exceptional places earn my 5 stars.)"}
{"text":"Wasn't bad..  At least they've got daily specials which seem to be becoming more and more uncommon for some stupid reason these days..  And the fries are always included free with any order of wings which is a nice touch.

That McLaughlin/Bovaird area needed a bar so it's a good location IMO.  Beer selection was basic but at least they've got the sub-zero taps for Canadian & Coors Light.  The place is brand new and very clean.  Wings were only so-so, should have been crispyer.  I think their oil temps are too low.

We'll be back for a pint and pound of wings"}
{"text":"Service : 3 / 5
Environment : 3 / 5
Food & Drinks : 2.5 / 5
Price : 2.5 / 5

Overall : 11 / 20 

Comments: 
- food is 50/50 ... it's typical pub food, wings here are sub-par (tends to be over-cooked)
- environment is small, and parking is at the back which is a bit inconvenient during the winter months due to the fact the side walk rarely gets shoveled."}
{"text":"I really don't the big deal about St. Louis..

I live close to this location, and even the convenience of living close doesn't make me EVER wanna go back, EVER!

The service is truly terrible, terrible, terrible. Not to mention the food, well I wouldn't feed it to my dog, and I don't even have a dog!

I do not understand why it is extremely busy here, always.. oh wait, I do, because it is a bar and it attracts the drunks; DUH!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my partner. and were told booths are only for 4 or more guests. The restaurant was empty besides a few people, one was a couple sitting in a booth... There were 8+ booths available at the time. We were seated at the bar which was uncomfortable so we walked out. Lost a sale and further business for the dumbest reason."}
{"text":"We have driven past this place numerous time on our way to Jack Astors down the road. Yesterday we decided to stop in instead of gong to Jack's.

It is tucked in a small strip mall area and a little hard to get to.

Parking was good, and that's where it ends.

We had to walk past a couple of smokers in front and noticed the ground was covered in butts - not a good look.

We went inside and didn't expect it to look the way it did - old.

We were thinking of leaving, but decided to stay as the food reputation was good.

Our Server was friendly and although we were rushed to place our food order - BTW the place was not busy - we opted for a drink first.

This chain apparently has won 'awards' for their Chicken wings, and it was 'Wing and Rib' special day.

I ordered the special and all I can say is that the wings were black and looked burned. Although the sauce was passable, the wings did not have to be 'burned'.

We quickly finished and left and will never return."}
{"text":"Service, food and atmosphere Amazing!
But be aware of a waitress(she is a blonde)  honking like crazy I mean really seriously loud and hysterically and  scares your kids while you are trying to park on the road. I guess she was too late for the work. Or she was tooooo exited and welcomed the customer in advance."}
{"text":"Let me reiterate their spicy wings are hot.  Their wings are very tasty.  The service is excellent.  The only downside is the lack of air conditioning.  Great barfood!"}
{"text":"I was in Toronto for a Bachelorette party. All 11 of us were white, except for one, who was Hispanic. We just arrived via train, checked into our place, walked to the first bar we saw. Having no drinks, the bouncer greats us. About a 1/2 of block back was our one Hispanic friend. He denies us entry saying she looked intoxicated from 2 blocks away. I really don't care about reviews in general. But the racism of this place was too much ignore. Minority against minority. It's a shame."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this St Louis I had way better St Louis . I tried alot of them and I will say this is one of the worst once I had. The only star they got are the place the place is nice with lots of TV screens otherwise nop. I hated the wings they were old or something I had many wings from St Louis and these were the worst . also the manager or something the main guy there sucks. He was rude and arguing too much with me about that he called my name although I did not hear him so he made me wait 10 more min which is stupid. So I will recommend people to try another one."}
{"text":"I came the other day to grab some wings during the Tuesday special. The place is nice organized with lots of TVs to watch. What I hated the most is how the greet the people incoming. The place is packed as the have half price wings. So they ask you for your name and write it down wait till seats are available then call your name. They were missing some names and misplacing the order of the incoming people. As they do not go out to call for the name although most of the people are outside. Also there were many empty tables, but it took them a while to clean and call people to be seated. Also the expected time was bad. After waiting 20 min the guy said another 20 min and after two min a lady called us and said here are your seats as we were planning to leave. 

Other than the place was busy the waiting time was annoying the food was good quality and serving was amazing. Washrooms were great. I just wish they improve on the door service specially for Tuesday."}
{"text":"Tits are big, and the 2 pint pitcher of molson for $7 is nice (only goes until Canada day though).

Other than that there isn't much good to say about this place, and there are many places that cheap beer and tits can be found.

Just an Average chain bar really, I had 2 different kinds of wings with my dad, the Cajun and the buffalo. Both were extremely salty and I had a stomachache after about 4 wings, the 2 pints of beer didn't help either. Although I do admit that the sauce of the wings had good flavor but it was way too salty.

The service was pretty bad, our waitress kept on not caring that our (beer for fucks sake!)glasses were empty and constantly forgot stuff we asked for. She was nice at least, it would have been really bad if she was a bitch as well. I have never seen any other type of service in a liquor serving establishment other than constant hounding of \"do you want more alcohol to drink?\" this was pretty unbelievable. 

There are tons of better bars on the danforth so other than some of their beer deals at st. Louis there really isn't any reason to come here."}
{"text":"My friend had a $6.99/jerk chicken special and she enjoyed the flavour and spice of it & it came with fries and colelaw. 

I had wings Hotter than Hell which is as spciy as you can get and I do like them. 

Our server was really nice and was well attentive but I guess she could be because the place wasn't very busy. 

We'd go back and check the place out again."}
{"text":"We had a good time watching the hockey game & wrestling while we tried the sampler plate and drank cold beer in chilled glasses & it was all super reasonable."}
{"text":"As far as the franchises for this chain go, this is by far the most inviting.  Insofar as emoting a place that would have good wings and fun service and the like, you get the sense that this place can deliver.  Hard wood all over the place, you sort of feel like you're in a barbecue joint in Missouri.  Not that I've been (and that is a failing on my part I am trying to correct at earliest convenience).  It feels much more homey and friendly than other St. Louis' that I've been in.

I once performed here for a breast cancer fundraiser on their stage at the back of the restaurant near the bar before a band came on to close the night.  I think that's what may give the place a good feeling.  The fact there is a stage, an opportunity for a band to bring the night to life, or a comic to struggle his way through 20 minutes of crap while you negotiate your plate of wings and ribs (me not bitter...and truly I'm not...glad to help the pink ribboners), it provides a strength to the environment that most of the other franchises seem to miss.

I know it's a franchise, but I find that even the wings even seem to taste better here.  Huh."}
{"text":"My friend and I both ordered The Messy Vegetarian Burger that came with a side of fries. I had their regular golden fries and my friend had sweet potato fries! The patty is made up of black beans I think, and it came with lettuce, diced tomatoes, diced red onions and diced jalapeños. Although this isn't the BEST burger I've ever had, it's definitely more high quality than Harvey's black bean burger if you were to compare it to that. We really liked the burger, and we both cleared our food. The only thing I'd say though is that the fries were more on the salty side (though I don't normally eat out or consume a lot of sodium), so I was really thirsty later."}
{"text":"Thursday night entrance by 9pm.  The place was half empty.  We ordered the lemon pepper and Mississippi honey bbq for the 2lb for me and my gf. The side option was veggies instead of fries. We also ordered the bucket fries which was half price.  The wings came a bit too dry, overcooked for the lemon pepper.  The taste was ok. The sauce on Mississippi honey bbq was perfect.  The bucket fries was full to the top and it was delightful.  The crowd was a bit loud, looks like majority there are regulars.  Leaf game was on, may be they can fix the right tv as the screen seemed to be burnt.  

Ordered the apricot beer that came in a can, we asked for a glass, but this glass had lip residue on it, yuck.  Tender agreed to replace a clean one.

I would recommend this place for sports game viewing pleasure as they have daily specials."}
{"text":"Nice place. Staff are nice and place is usually busy! The stupidest thing is that if you are there to eat and catch a late show at SilverCity, you can not get back in! You have to walk or drive over to the other side of the mall!"}
{"text":"Staff are great! I love this location as it is walking distance to my house. The food is generally good.  Wings are not as juicy as other locations, but they are NOT bad either (I have had worst).  I have not tried the ribs here, so that would be another review."}
{"text":"The wings are always cheap here but over the years it has definitely gone downhill. The fries are still great with the house sauce!  A great casual place for hassle free drinks and wings"}
{"text":"Small crowded and terrible service.  20 min to get our food order.  Actually called the restaurant to get service.  Toilet paper just sitting on top of the commode"}
{"text":"This location serves as the friendly local bar that also serves wings/food. The atmosphere is always friendly and welcoming, with a shot of energy, especially if there's a game on tv.

There are daily food specials that really draw crowds. Tall boys, wine, bar rails and Cesar's are $5 from 12-5:30. 

The food is good by bar standards and not the reason you come, it's there to support the bar experience. The servers are friendly and always have a smile."}
{"text":"Good sports bar away from the frenzied downtown core. It shows the game, pints are a good price, and they always have good deals. Recently, they updated their menus a bit to include things that are not wings. I always like choices. Decided to go with the chicken and waffles. Overall, I thought that it was a good choice. The waffles were a bit too sweet for me. I would like the chicken with a bit more hot sauce, but overall it was good. Caesars for $5 which I can't resist a good Caesar. This one didn't have enough kick to it for my liking. Either not enough alcohol or not enough hot sauce. When I am in the area, I always stop in for a drink or some good food. Overall, pleased with this chain."}
{"text":"Good spot to get a cheap beer and some nice wings. This isn't the prize of Toronto,  but you can't beat this place on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"3.8**

As far as a bar goes, this place is definitely competitive....so I must weigh in with a 4 to balance some of those unwaranted ones and twos. On any given evening during the summer season this place is almost guaranteed to be bustling....and why shouldn't they be with that amazing outdoor patio fit with palm trees and flat screens.

Tuesday is half-price wings night and this is by far the busiest place on the block. You can pick up 1lb of good wings accompanied by their crispy pub fires for only $5! That's as good as it gets IMO.

I usually get their new salt and pepper dry wings b/c I'm not one for all that sauce, and they are actually really tasty with a good amount of meat. I've had their club too which is good too and filled with peppercorn ham, chicken, and bacon. I can also reccomend the Asian chicken salad.....their Greek and Cobb are very good as well.

It's loud, it's lively and there's no better place in the area to catch a game with some friends and brew."}
{"text":"They have a large menu and I was looking through it and was asked 2x for food order.  Pretty dead so I get it, you have nothing to do,  but just shows server etiquette - wait till I close the menu!  Maybe even serve the 2 that just walked in and then out the door a few minutes later?
So then another server arrived..  She walked by and I smiled but didn't get one back..  grumpy..  
But the brunette behind the bar seems friendly..  And everyone seemed to know 'Marco' when he showed up.. Even the blonde server and I happened to make eye contact and I got a smile. I'll reserve any further judgement until after my wings arrive. 
--
Food's here:
Wings were just ok..  actually I preferred the fries anyway. Also to note,  that one server doesn't seem to smile even at her coworkers. 
And my server came back and was ok as a server...
I just feel that overwhelmingly I was just meh,  ya know? 
k.

Edit: ok, my mistake, she does smile and I got one later.

Edit 2: ok my server was nice too.. I'll bump a star."}
{"text":"Went back when I was in Toronto again and still liked the experience. Was upset that my server from last time didn't work there anymore but people move on from jobs. Loved the Caesars and the St. Louis poutine was good. Will be back when I come back to Toronto. The server was friendly and did check on me when she was able to. Would recommend if you are visiting from America and want to experience St. Louis cuisine. I would also recommend to anyone else looking for something new."}
{"text":"We have 2 people here waited for 30 minutes for a table on Tuesday. Once we received our food we thought the wait was worth it. 

Tuesday and Thursday has the best deal because of half price wings and half price starters. They have a good selection of beer as well and they are reasonably priced. 

I particularly like this location because they don't cheap out on the wings and fries. Even it's Tuesday half priced wings, there was more food in the basket than the last time when I was at another St.Louis in central downtown location."}
{"text":"I've never been to a St. Louis Bar and Grill before but if they are all like this, I would definitely try another one.

Being from out of town, one of my friends from the Toronto area suggested we meet him here. 

The layout of the bar is great and offers lots of space and it was clean. Our server was quick and very friendly. I ordered 1 pound of medium saucy wings. 

The food arrived in about 10 minutes and was served nice and hot. The flavour of the wings were nice and it came with a side of fries and dill sauce. I'm usually a Buffalo and Ranch sauce kinda guy but these wings and sauce were a tasty change from my norm. We also shared a pitcher of Bud Light which was served at the perfect temperature. 

My overall experience at this St. Louis was great and would recommend it if you are looking for decent wings and beer in the Central Toronto area."}
{"text":"Ewwwwww. Worst wings ever!!!!    

I am normally a fan of the St. Louis Bar and Grill franchise but this location sucks.  

Ordered wings last week for take-out and they were the DRIEST wings I think I've ever had in my life.  Thank God for that dill sauce or else the whole meal would have been inedible.  We asked for medium and the level of spice was completely undetectable... didn't even taste like they put any sauce on them at all.  Also, the celery sticks we got were WHITE, not green like celery should be. They were also served in a puddle of water.

One of the worst meals I've had in a long time....  

I'll be sticking to the Atrium or Yonge & Eg locations for my wing fix from now on, thank you very much."}
{"text":"I went in on Saturday night and the place wasn't very full so I was a little worried about this place. The service was good and the beers were cold! I ordered the Saturday special (full rack for 19.99)  I have never had a Mcrib from McDonalds but I would bet they taste better than these ribs. I've been to St Louis and had ribs and on the worst day you couldn't get rib like this.  The sauce is bland and then taste was just average. 

Look for other places when in the area."}
{"text":"So after the manager replied to this review, my work and I gave this place another try. I have to say it's been much better.

The manager explained how the error occurred with my onion rings and subsequent orders have been just fine."}
{"text":"I went on a quest to find the best wings in the city and these are definitely not it. I do like the patio, however, in the summer."}
{"text":"Great place for a drink close to the Skydome. Horrible food. Nachos were stale. Minimalistic. Low key service."}
{"text":"This location is on Bloor street between Spadina and Bathurst Street. They open until late. We ordered Nachos which was enough big share with my friend. I really like here so if I have a chance to come here late, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I like St. Louis. This location also good. Food taste was good. My table was shaking that's only my complaint. Overall is good."}
{"text":"This place is crap. The people are strange with pierced everything. I just don't like the service here or the hair colour. They made this some exclusive club for weirdos. It's like eating leftovers. And the service is very slow. Not a good option"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. 
 The warm friendly welcome from the new owners, the upbeat casual atmosphere and most excellent wings made this place a great choice.

We will be back for another feast of wings soon!"}
{"text":"During my journey of downtown shopping, I ventured into St. Louis Bar and Grill. Seeking delicious and affordable food, I had high expectations with an empty stomach. After receiving our table, the waitress took our orders for drinks. The waitress mistakenly misheard me saying hot water as my drink (no harm, no foul). I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and chicken wings. Reviewed on the Android phone. Each paragraph represents an update.

My stomach is empty, making noises for food. Disappointed with the wait for my burger and chicken wings.

The wait for the food was justified. After several minutes of patiently waiting, our food arrived to the table together. The pulled pork sandwich tasted amazing. The BBQ sauce tasted amazing with the pulled pork. The fries accommodates the burger perfectly. The pulled pork satisfied my hunger. 

Initially disappointed with the wait, the pulled pork sandwich stole the show. The atmosphere is cool and the decor is expected from a bar and grill. The food is a huge improvement from the Brampton location. My only disappointment is the service. The drinks and the check (or bill, which ever you prefer) were slow to arrive. I recommend this to everyone looking for a quick bite or place to hang out."}
{"text":"After long hours of studying and exams, I decided to treat myself with delicious food. My friends and I ordered takeout from St. Louis Bar & Grill and at Pizza Hut. At St. Louis, we decided to get chicken wings and fries.  The chicken wings were dry and bland. However, the fries tasted decent. Although they were not crispy to my preference, they  served well with the dill sauce (tasted awesome albeit I don't know the exact name of it). St. Louis Bar & Grill was overall disappointing. The food was not good. However, the dill sauce adds to the score with an overall of 3 out of 5 stars. I recommend this to everyone looking for takeout or a hangout with friends.
Update Correction: Dill sauce is the correct name."}
{"text":"Great patio in the summer. The staff are always so friendly, no matter how busy it is. For a sports bar, you can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Came to this place on Monday to give it a try always say it and glad I came. Only had 45mins for lunch so I had to be fast.

It's nice and small. Lots of tv to watch w.e sport is on. A great signed Tom Brady tshirt hanging there.

I got the ribs wing and fries plates. I wasn't to sure on what I ordered worried it wouldn't be great. The wings and ribs came out so good. Loved how it had so much sauce and it all tasted great. The server didn't get her name she was blond was very cheerful hardworking and she kept on checking in on us great place.

I will be coming back to this location and take it slow with the menu.
A must go"}
{"text":"If I could give This place ZERO stars I would, people it's better to go to McDonalds than this place, went to wonderland all day with a group of 9 was hungry came in place was busy so I understand the slow service that's not my issue I ordered a cheeseburger was brought a angus burger no cheese, the waitress noticed and took it back right away they than proceeded to throw a cold piece of cheese on top of the burger and call it a night. Than I bit into my burger to find out it was black charcoal burnt I was immediately disgusted asked them to take It back and just take it off the bill never coming back here again don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Service from the kitchen was terrible. Took us 2 hours to get cold food for our group--despite reservations and letting them know we had a time limit. The waitstaff did their best to compensate."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for something a bit unhealthy today. Why, because I've been working hard to drop some weight. Naturally a good helping of chicken wings and fries were in order. 

The staff are friendly and courteous. More importantly they actually had really good service. I'm mean fantastic. 

Ordered a pound of wings and fries. It's served with a yummy dill dip which I really enjoy and always have. About two years ago when I ate at St. Louis more often, they would only give you one dill dip. I always bought an extra one. 

After 10 mins or so, the food arrived freshly cooked. I noticed that the portion sizes are much smaller than they used to be. I also found that their portion of fries were also much smaller. On a positive note, they provided 2 dill sauces. The wings were tasty but a little over sauces in my opinion. They were definitely less meaty than they used to be. The fries were on the soggier side which I didn't enjoy very much as they are better served when fully cooked. 

What stuck out to me the most is that their pound of wings now cost $13 and change. 

They're almost 2-3 $$$ more than they were!

I'm sorry but if you're going to decrease the portion sizes and increase the price, that formula doesn't work for me, and I won't be returning. 

The math: walked out paying almost $22 for a pound of wings and a Diet Coke (tip and taxes included). 

That's insane."}
{"text":"Generally speaking, I'm actually a big fan of St. Louis. My girl friend had never been there so I wanted her to try their delicious wings. I ordered half a pound of wings and fries (Buffalo Ranch) and she got the chicken tenders. My wings came dry to the bone. Fries undercooked. Wings were not as saucy as they usually are. Her chicken tenders were revolting. They looked like crap and tasted even worse. The menu said crispy. They were served soggy. We brought it up with the waitress (who was nice) but the damage was done. Took the food to go and called it a learning lesson. The sad thing is that most of the st. Louis' I've been to have been awesome. It was her first time and she was totally turned off. :( 2 stars cause of the server."}
{"text":"Just came on a Thursday where the special is half price starters with the purchase of a drink. My girlfriend really wanted wings. I know this place can get pretty busy, especially during popular sports games.

We ordered the Starter Sampler (includes wings, got Garlic Parmesan) , and an extra lb of wings (Buffalo Ranch). The daily special works on top of the drink special for a 23oz of domestic. The Sampler is a great plate to share. The riblets were a bit dry but everything else was pretty good. The wings satisfied my girlfriend's wings craving. Price was reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here for 1/2 off wings on Tuesday! Line was out the door to get a seat! SOLID food. The place is a bit small, but that's the trend I've been seeing in this part of Toronto. I had the Hot & Honey, Lemon Pepper and Asian Fusion flavor wings. All were very good. I love that fries come with the wings, definitely a good value there. 2 pounds of wings with friends for like $11.50?! SOLD! Lol. Only drawback was that it was super busy and I had to ask for water refills. No worries though! You'll see me again!"}
{"text":"Went for AYCE wings. I love wings and can throw them down pretty quickly. The first round was a decent amount but the refills were 1/2 lb which worked out to be 4 wings. When asked to have a full pound as a refill I was told that its their policy. I spent more time waiting for food than actually enjoying it. Staff was nice and efficient for the most part. Probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"This location is fairly new and close to home so I had to try it. It was very busy and felt smaller than it looks from the outside. Typical sports bar setup with lots of big screen TVs. The servers were quite friendly and attentive.

My friend and I opted for the half price wing special (every Tuesday from 4pm). One pound of wings works out to 8 pieces and includes fries and a creamy dipping sauce. They were good, just above average, but I expected better from a place that specializes in chicken wings. I would have preferred a crispier texture before being tossed in the sauce. The fries were nice and crispy."}
{"text":"I like this location. It super busy around dinner time, but that only affirms it being good ! 
The waitresses are really great- attentive and polite. They usually notice my water is done before i do. 
The food always comes out perfect. Never had any issues and ive been going here for years now. 
They have a nice patio, which is now smoke free- but thats not their fault. 
They have cool daily food specials and a huge drink menu. 
Lots of parking, more can be found behind the building. 
Clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Good wings, especially the Chipotle mango and Cajun. The service was decent, considering they were packed since it was half price wings night. Cheap wings, good flavour, good times."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the boyfriend. As soon as I walked in, we were greeted instantly and served with our drinks. Management and server were on top of their game. Amazing customer service. Unfortunately the food we ordered did not live up to the service. We both didn't finish our food and it wasn't worth it to take it to go. It was that bad. When we asked for the bill, it took a while for the server to get back to us but she was the only one running around the restaurant serving people. Overall it was an okay experience."}
{"text":"Was here for lunch today and was served cold not even warm fries. Also a hair in my philly cheese steak. Tony the general manager didn't even want to talk to me at first and pawned me off to the server who was very cordial. Tony then debated with me why his kitchen staff didn't wear hair nets and although he took care of my bill waited to do so. It was never offered up immediately. Tony shouldn't be in management."}
{"text":"Wings are really good (hotter than hell). Good atmosphere to sit down and eat/drink while the game is on. Wish the service was a bit more attentive, otherwise a good experience"}
{"text":"I'm in town visiting family and we stopped by at around 8 PM after hockey practice. Amazing service, our waitress was attentive and quick to make sure we were comfortable and satisfied. The food was delicious, I got the Thai lettuce wraps and they were very good, but extra spicy (for my tastes at least). Stole a couple of fries from my cousin and I've got to say, they were some of the best I've had! They were like waffle fries and were super crunchy! The dipping sauce that comes with all the wings was really good too!"}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate with my friend for her birthday. We walked in shortly after 5:30pm and there was already a line up with a waiting time of 15 mins... could be because it was the beginning of March Break lol. 

Anyway, we were seated by the window, and I had two coupons i got from a friend for free wings, so we added another order of chicken and waffles so that there is more variety than just wings! The waitress that served us was very nice and friendly!

The chicken and waffle was amazing! The only suggestion is I would've appreciated a little less sauce on my waffles, but they were still crispy and the chicken and waffle was a perfect combination of savoury and sweet! It was so delicious and I would definitely want to eat this again the future!

The wings were great. I love how they are not soggy with sauce and that you can still taste the crisp of the chicken wings. They have a bunch of flavours, but my favourite is Asian BBQ and Honey Garlic :) anyway the wings are not too messy despite having the sauce on, and it was a perfect combo of sauce and crispy chicken skin *Yes i know its not that healthy but it's okay to indulge in it once in a while - Hard to turn off the nature of my work as an RD lol*

Anyway this location in particular I do quite like, and would definitely go back for more wings esp because Tuesdays are half price wings! :)"}
{"text":"This is a well run location of St. Louis. Fast and friendly service and great food and ambience. They never screw anything up here. The operator of St. Louis at Yonge and Wellesley should be forced to take lessons from whoever runs this location. It is night and day the difference in what should be a consistent franchise model."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of St. Louis, but this location is terrible. Service is non-existent and the wait staff is complacent. I even saw them drop a cutlery set on the ground and then set it on a table for use. It is always empty, even during big events so that will tell you something."}
{"text":"I appreciate chained restaurants for their predictability, and often reasonable pricing.  Yet what differentiates a good branch location from an average one is the services.  Our waitress was very friendly, eager to serve, and willing to go the extra mile.  The lunch special stipulated the ordering of a large beverage.  I wanted to order a light beer, she immediately recommended the special deal of the day ($6 for a pint).  A pregnant co-worker couldn't order a beer to go with the lunch special.  The waitress allowed her to sup with a soup.  She would split bill no sweat.  Patio was okay.  What more could I ask from St Louis?"}
{"text":"This place is just good for drinks. Food is not good at all. Driest burger of my life. No sauce. They forgot to add cheese and when asked for one, they just brought a slice and charged $1.49 for it. We asked for garlic sauce for fries and what they had was mayonnaise."}
{"text":"It was the first hot, sunny day of the year and we were in desperate need of some patio time. St. Louis Bar & Grill was surprisingly crowded for 5:15 on a weekday, but it wasn't too long before we were shown to a choice table in the packed outdoor seating area.

After perusing the fairly long menu for a few minutes, we settled upon the always-reliable pub choice of nachos (\"Seasoned tortilla chips topped with a shredded cheese blend, tomatoes, green onion, fresh salsa and jalapeños. Served with sour cream and a side of freshly made salsa.\") and added guacamole and chili to our order.

The dish arrived about 15 minutes later and it was a hell of a sight. It basically looked like someone had poured soup atop a plate of plain nacho chips. And that's exactly what it tasted like, too.

The \"chili\" was so watery that I'm not sure it even qualified as chili anymore. It didn't possess any of the flavors one associates with chili and it was completely lacking in anything resembling spice.

The nachos underneath were naturally completely soggy and kind of gross as a result, and the extremely sparse application of cheese ensured that the dish didn't even have the ooey, gooey texture one associates with nachos. (The accompanying guacamole, sour cream, and salsa was pretty good, at least.)

Adding insult to injury, the whole thing arrived to our table room temperature. I don't know how long it had been sitting there before we got it, but the dish was basically cold by the time we began eating. So absolutely disgusting.

This may have been the worst plate of nachos I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a *lot* of nachos in my time."}
{"text":"Was a great day to be on the patio, but they've blocked off any kind of view which isn't great.
We both ordered new menu items.  She had the Korean salad and i the Korean BBQ steak sandwich.  
Meh.  is my thought, she was even less thrilled."}
{"text":"St Louis is a Tuesday go-to because they offer half-price wings with the order of a drink. I've been to a few locations and never have a problem but this one fared worse than the others.

The food itself is fine. The wings are a bit dryer than Wild Wing but it's good. I love their fries, I feel like they give less here. Nothing else worth noting food-wise.

Here's why they get 3/5:
The service is... eh.
-My servers here usually seem stressed. They try to be friendly through it but it's evident. I've been here numerous times. It's a small restaurant and I usually see two servers inside which doesn't seem unreasonable but they seem overwhelmed so that's either a matter or training or understaffing.

-They don't allow for takeout boxes on Tuesday. Whether it's just for the wings or for anything else that day, I don't know.

-They give you one dill sauce and charge $1 more for each additional, whether you got 1lbs or 2lbs.

They're small but having gone to 5 different locations and this being the only one to have these policies and issues... the penny-pinching is definitely magnified.

I'll still come back cause hey, I live down the street but if I wasn't then I wouldn't choose it."}
{"text":"Located in a strange plaza that seems more like industrial offices than strip mall, this St Louis is a bit harder to find from Dixon Rd. Watch out for the signage as you can't quite see the store from the road. However, it is one of the few St Louis with no line out the door on a Tuesday. Service was great but the wings were a bit dry and overcooked. I've had better at the other chains but no wait gives it +1 !"}
{"text":"Was craving the St Louis special on Tuesday but didn't want to go to the usual local North York St Louis on Yonge at 7pm (long wait). I was sold on the location after some google-fu when I found out that this restaurant is only 15 minutes away. I have to say though, parking is a pain and it is a bit tight. However, I was seated quickly and the wings arrived promptly. Great service, wings tasted good as usual. Would come back here again for the Tuesday special!"}
{"text":"This is honestly by far one of the worst st. Louis i have ever gome to. I probably shamed the last 5 generations of my family for even coming to this location. This just proves anything in richmond hill is just horrendous service. To start off the service is so bad that i have to take so Tylenol just to handle being there. The servic to start. Oh dont get me started. They literally walk pass you and give zero to no thoughts about your request despite having your hand raised for the last 15 minutes. I ordered the AYCE boneless wings and it was the worse call i have ever made in my life. The wait time for each additional order was 30-45 minutes and they only give you 5 little chicken nuggets that doesnt even have any sauce or flavor to it. I could literally walk to mcdonald buy the nuggets, finish an order of 20, and watch an episode of breaking bad before they even punch the order in the POS system. And when i asked for a different flavor they gave me the sauce, just the sauce, 20 MINUTES LATER and they charged me for it. When i tried to complain about it, i see workers drinking behind the counter look at my plea for help then ignored me. I honestly could get better service at a ttc station buying a beef patty or a corn dog off of some random stranger. Not only the better service but itll actually have some flavor to it. I genuinely believe that this place doesn't even deserve to be called a bar and grill, let alone even a place thats allowed to sell food. I will continue my tradition of drivong 30-40 km to Scarborough town center for wings cause the gas is honestly worth it. To anybody reading this please rethink if your going to this location unless you wish to leave full... Of disappointment. If yiur craving wings, theres a loblaws at yonge and bernard. I heard president's choice isn't  bad and it'll definitely put this location to shame."}
{"text":"Looking for a late night meal. Actually, just wanted wings. Called to place an order for takeout at 12:45. Manager (female) says they closed the kitchen 10 minutes ago and last call for bar just happened. Why advertise 1:00 am closing time if you close at 12:40-45ish. Put that on your website instead. Horrible customer service and lazy employees who get paid to cook and clean until 1:00 am."}
{"text":"Dirty and generally unappealing. I have enjoyed St. Louis in the past and trust me I know the pub experience, I have no high expectations but this place seems run down and dirty. The airconditioning was blasting and some chemical smell from the vents, the patio was unswept. It was just a bad experience. I will try the St. Louis on Davisville one more time before I write off this chain but the one on Bloor is gross as far as I'm concerned."}
{"text":"Good wings, good service 
Half priced wings on Tuesday's, dine in only w/Tha purchase of a drink. Dine in only.
I think I deserve a pound on the house for tht free endorsement"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim with some friends on Saturday afternoon.

The server that greeted us was cheerful and upbeat, and we were served by the bar tender. We ordered a pitcher of rickards red along with a bucket of fries and bucket of onion rings.

The onion rings were very crunchy and crispy, while the fries were thick cut and a bit on the soft side for my liking.

The \"bucket\" is really just a mini bucket that isn't that large at all. It's the height of  a glass of water, so I didn't feel this was very good value.

A very solidly \"decent\" experience, but definitely not a place I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"Didn't think I would write a review for a franchise restaurant but I thought i should for this specific St. Louis location.  

Came to this location for the first time on a Tuesday night for their half price wings special.  My boyfriend and I waited 10 minutes for our table which is pretty good compared to the other locations.  We ordered right away when we got our table as we were starving.....

We waited for a good 20 - 25 mins (at least) for our food to come which we thought it was unreasonably long.  The first thing we noticed was the food portions were not up to the \"st Louis\" standard that we were used to at other locations.  The order for 2 lbs of wings definitely looked more like 1.5lb instead.  The wings were so dry and slighly burnt, they were just overcooked.  

This location really did not live up to the St Louis standard.   It was really disappointing, dont think we will come back to this location."}
{"text":"My family and I went to this location last night for my brother's birthday. Right away, we got the rudest waitress to serve us (Asian lady with glasses). She never smiled, say please or thanks. When we asked for some water, she shook her head then walked away. I guess she wanted us to order drinks so she can get more tips. It was unfortunate the tip was charged to our bill automatically, otherwise we would've gave her a lower percentage. Besides the terrible service, the food was good. The other locations are much better than this one."}
{"text":"We come for Raptors, Wings and a Brew!

He gets the, Hotter than Hell
I get the, Hot

Great flavour and they have spice if that's what you're after!

Sports pub vibe, large screen TV's, friendly staff and speedy service.

If you're looking for a neighborhood sports pub this is the place!"}
{"text":"Go on Tuesday - it's wing night. The wings are good and the beer is frosty. You get fries (even on Tuesday) with your wings. Try getting 'free' fries @ Duff's! Also, the scale of hotness (scovilles) is much tamer than Duff's. Suicide here is Medium Hot there. Oh, and the spicier it gets doesn't mean more burning, but more flavour. If you like wings, you'll like this place."}
{"text":"Although I usually get scared off by any restaurant belonging to a chain, St. Louis is quite decent. I ordered the honey garlic wings meal, and it was delicious! Definitely one of the better wings places I've been to. I would say the pricing was about average.

The atmosphere... well, it definitely wasn't my kind of scene, but some may like it. I was here when a Jays game was going on, so the place was noisy and crowded with sports fans wearing jerseys and caps. If I was there to see a game and wanted to grab a bite to eat with some friends, I'd probably come back. Otherwise, I prefer to go somewhere a bit quieter where I can just chill out and actually hear the people I'm with."}
{"text":"I used to really love St. Louis when they only used to be at the CNE. Once a year, I would go to the Food Building, get the wings with the magical dill sauce... When it became a chain years ago, I really anticipated getting this amazing sauce whenever I wanted. Turns out, much like anything that expands too quickly, it took something great and ruined it. Now, I wouldn't even consider St. Louis a good wing place to go to, much less recommend. Better food, and always better service, elsewhere."}
{"text":"I used to really love St. Louis Wings, but I think since the chain has grown, the quality of the food has suffered greatly. The dill sauce is the ONLY redeeming quality of St. Louis and, let's be honest, one sauce does not a great restaurant make. But to add insult to injury, the service at the Fairview mall location is deplorable. I find it difficult to understand why there were so many instances I looked up and didn't see a SINGLE employee on the floor. Our waitress was great for coming in and getting our drinks... then, suddenly, a struggle to find absolutely ANYBODY who worked there to take our orders, refill waters and, the marker of truly terrible service, WAITING FOR OUR BILL. We (finally) had our table cleared of our long-finished meals only to wait at the empty table for roughly 20 minutes AFTER we had finished just to find someone to ask for our bill. I would never come back here again, and suggest that you don't waste your time either."}
{"text":"Best wing place on a Tuesday (1/2 price wings) and Thursdays (1/2 starters and shareable)! They have different deals everyday which is great! 


Pros:
- Food: Food here is always consistent and great! The wings are made fresh and the flavours don't vary amongst the location. The fries here are awesome, so crispy and goes well with their specialty sauce! 
- Service: The servers are really nice and are pretty accurate in terms of wait times. 

Cons:
- Line ups: Unfortunately because the restaurant is smaller, there is usually a line up to get in (especially on Tuesdays). I recommend going a little earlier around 6:00-6:30pm to avoid a lineup if you choose to go on a popular day. 
- Parking: No back lot for parking so you will most likely have to pay for parking. Street parking using the GreenP app is great if you want to keep track of how long you are going to be there. 


Foods I love:
- Wings: Honey Garlic, Hot Sweet Asian, Garlic Parm
- Appetizers: Bacon Wrapped Mac N Cheese, Sweet Potato Fries,"}
{"text":"If you have been to a St. Louis before then you already know what the wings taste like so I won't get into that very much. If you haven't I suggest trying their wings as they are quite tasty imo, though they were much better back in the day when the wings were bigger in size.

The biggest complaint I have with this location is they are supposedly a sports bar, but everytime I try to watch a game here they don't put on the sound. Most of the servers seem to prefer to listen to the radio when people clearly come here to watch games (all dressed in jerseys of teams playing, etc.).

They seem to cater more to a baseball crowd, which makes sense as they are accross from the Rogers Center, but don't care about any other sports. Whoever owns this place really needs to turn this place into more of a sports themed bar that it is set up to be, otherwise just take the TV's off of the walls."}
{"text":"Not really impressed with my experience here on a Friday night. I came here for some wings (obvi) and to watch the game. 

We were seated promptly but it took forever to order our drinks and food. Waitresses kept zooming past us and yes,  I understand Friday night is busy,  but we felt invisible. I think the manager finally came around to us 10 minutes later, only to ask,  \"have you been taken care of\"? 

The wings are mediocre. I like the free fries and dill sauce that comes with. No one came to check up on us and when they did,  we were already done.  The manager came back to ask how everything is, when really she should have asked how everything was. 

I don't think I'll be back but good on them for playing the basketball game instead of hockey."}
{"text":"I like the outdoor setup here. Waterproof HDTV's, outdoor speakers so there is actualy sound when watching a game. There are also large umbrellas to shelter from the rain and outdoor heaters for when it gets too chilly. Awesome outdoor setup and makes me wish I had that in my own backyard.

The food was average at best. Wings were small but flavourful. It came with a small hand full of fries and a nice dill dipping sauce for $12.99

Also got the rib and wing combo for $21.99 which comes with coleslaw and once again a small hand full of fries. The fries were nice and crispy and tasted great with the dipping sauce but I think they could have given a bit more fries. 

You can get half price wings on Tuesdays and the rib and wing combo for $19.99 on Friday's. Too bad the basketball game was on a Thursday so no specials that I could take advantage of other than half price appetizers.

Service was pretty fast considering how busy it was. Parking can be a problem because there are other restaurants around with a small parking lot."}
{"text":"Thursday night, met old co-workers for a catch-up session after a few months.

Didn't feel like getting the usual famous wings/ribs so I decided to try the Thursday night special.  After 4PM appetizers are half off with a purchase of a large drink.  Not bad!  I ordered the new signature Buffalo Chicken Flatbread, Small Classic Poutine and a large iced tea.

Buffalo Chicken Flatbread was surprisingly pretty good.  It surpassed my expectations in taste and presentation.  It had buffalo chicken bites, sautéed onion, shredded-cheese, Buffalo sauce and get this...their famous Garlic DILL sauce.  That was the kicker!  Drizzling that delicious sauce over the flatbread was wonderful.  The only criticism about this appetizer was that the bread was a tad soft.  I'm not sure if it was supposed to be crispy at all but if it was I would have loved it.

Small Classic Poutine was just your regular 'ol, plain Jane poutine.  Nothing to really rave about but with the St. Louis fries, still delicious.

Marta was our waitress and took care of us during our visit and gave decent customer service.  She was really happy and attentive at the beginning but at the end of the night, she seemed tired which of course happens after a long day."}
{"text":"Went at 9 PM with my best friends but it was loaded with people because it was Friday night.  We had to take it upstairs to THE LOUNGE to see if there was any seats but there was not.  There was a couple of games going on so we had to wait.

The wait was 5 minutes and we sat down.  Our server was named Gloria and she was attentive and apologized for the wait and how busy it was.  Friday night for a limited time until the middle of April were All You Can Eat wings as long as you buy one beverage!  My boys made sure they locked in that order with their pitcher of beer.  She took our order and was really nice and smiley.

I ordered a pound of BBQ-Medium wings with fries and my wife ordered sweet potato fries.  The wings were okay, a tad on the sour side.  However, I cannot resist the St Louis crispy, golden fries with their signature dill sauce.  Holy, it's amazing.  The sweet potato fries were great too.  Nicely battered and skinny.  However, the sweet potato sauce was lacking and a bit mild.  Not as rich as sauces from other restaurants.

Although it was crazy busy, we had a great time.  Gloria always checked up on us and was happy to help and fill our waters.  From her customer service, I would return to The Lounge in the future."}
{"text":"I have never been to Canada and this place was a commercial bar with bar food. I got some honey hot wings that had a good sauce but I think the wings were small and not meaty, could have been because it was the special. I would come again if someone else recommended it but there are a few options on this road. Not bad food by any means, I would come again."}
{"text":"My go to for wings.  Large wings, fair price and fast service :) 

And go on Tuesdays!  Half price wings!"}
{"text":"I used to love this location but last nights visit changed my opinion entirely. 

Beer was decent but server was horrible. Not attentive at all and had to ask for the bill more than once. She didn't take as much time to chat with us or approach us in comparison to the other tables which had a bunch of guys. There was no approach and I didn't even know her name until I got the bill. I guess she cared more about tips than how to treat a customer with equality. It's just disappointing."}
{"text":"Worse St Louis I have ever been to. Rude and disrespectful servers that talk back to you. Not sure what kind of management is running this location but it's driving customers away. 

Food was below average and inconsistent. Sometimes it's good and other times it's horrible - burnt, over cooked and they serve you food that has gone bad claiming that's what it's supposed to look like. The manager refuses to give you any form of compensation and if they do its a \"favour\" don't expect it ever again. Oh and I've never seen the manager because they are never there to resolve the issue instead relay the message over the phone. I'm sorry but I don't have time to wait 20 minutes to come to the restaurant when I'm on a lunch break. 

Conclusion is don't come here unless you want to be treated like garbage."}
{"text":"This location is probably the saddest St. Louis I've been too, at least during the summer.

I know the space is small and not ideal for the sports loving fan. However, the kicker is pretty much the super half-hearted service one gets when visiting this location. 

I have been here a few times and while the food is more or less on par with other St. Louis locations, the service here is pretty lonely; since you have disinterested servers, who aren't really there. Mind you this could be different if there was an actually sports game on. 

Overall - take out is probably a good idea. Otherwise keep on walking for a place with a bit more life and ambience."}
{"text":"Gooood ole St.louis! I usually come here with my gf and her sisters or on Tuesdays for the half wings off! I love the fries here, they are nice and thick cut. The sauce that comes with it (I'm not too sure if it's for the wings or fries haha) I just use it on all the fries and it tastes so good! 

I usually get garlic parm wings, but I think I've gotten them all. My fav still is garlic parm and an order of rickards red. Too bad I can't do half and half because that would be good! Although the labor for that would be quite annoying though. 

This place can get packed as any wing place is easily packed. Depends what night the game is on or ufc. The parking lot is a tad small... or maybe it's a good size, but I think to me the lot is a bit small."}
{"text":"I come here a lot. Good prices for alcohol and there is a food special every day of the week. I love the fries here, always taste fresh. Wings are probably the dish I've ordered most. Chicken wing poutine is also very tasty. My friend and I usually get a pitcher of Guinness. This location's Guinness quality is hit and miss. Menu said imported, but sometimes it taste domestic. There is no way to tell from the pitcher."}
{"text":"*** Half price wings on Tuesdays***

I hadn't been to this place in a while as the last time I was here I had a bad experience, but this time the experience was amazing. The servers where quick and helpful and they made sure we were taken care of. I came here because a co worker had told me about the 1/2 price wings and I had the Korean BBQ wings and they were out of this world. They are sweet, so adding a little hot sauce really works on them."}
{"text":"Worse St. Louis I've been to! 

Seriously, three occasions ruined my experience here.. 
1. I came around 11pm one night to order takeout and no one helped me. Stood there for 10 min until a lady (who was drinking with some guys) came and rudely told me the kitchen was closed 

2. I came here trying to get takeout, a transaction that was supposed to take about 20 minutes but ended up taking an hour of me waiting to speak to 4 different employees..

3. Came here on a Tuesday expecting half price wings (which doesn't happen at this location btw) and some wings were cold.... 

Anyway the menu here is so short and there's no half price wings and the staff are hella rude. Don't think I'll be returning for a 4th time.."}
{"text":"This place was okay. I'm not too crazy when it comes to wings, but I have a decent idea on what's considered good wings and what's considered bad. This place wasn't bad; I'll give it that.

I only had lunch here because my friend I was with lives nearby and didn't want to drive/bus to any other lunch places. I didn't wanna eat at Gal's, so we decided on St. Louis Bar and Grill. We were welcomed immediately and sat immediately; it was a Friday lunch hour that was certainly not busy at all.

I had the St. Louis Devilishly Good Wings lunch special, which was a great deal for $10.99. The wings, however, took about 20-25 minutes to come out, which kinda puzzled me because the restaurant wasn't busy at all. The wings themselves, as I said, were decent, especially with the Korean BBQ sauce. They weren't the best I've had, but I've certainly had worse/inedible wings before. The fries that came with it were also quite good; no complaints in general.

However I'm only giving this place 3 stars due to the extreme slow service and overall \"A-OK\" reaction to this restaurant; nothing here tells me I should immediately come back sadly."}
{"text":"2.5/5 stars

I was craving for some wings so we ended up here because my sister said she liked the one she went to in Toronto. 

The restaurant is pretty small and it wasn't really busy on a Saturday night. Which I thought was weird. The server was attentive and the wings came out not too long after we ordered. The wings were just okay. There was nothing special about them and I felt like it was a little bit dry.

Overall, it was just meh."}
{"text":"Awesome food, pretty good service. Nothing wrong here, however there are certain customers that frequent some of these locations that raise a concern to me. They just seem off. i don't mean to sound offensive, they just put up my yellow caution flag. Other than that, its a great place"}
{"text":"Great food, great server!  Will be back!   Burgers and Poutine are on point!

Random Sunday adventure brought us here."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, great food and fast service even during the rush hours. One complaint I might have is that the tables are too small, Once you have you food and drinks on the table you barly have enough room for anything else. But other than that I have nothing bad to say. and well for sure be returning when I have then need for some good wings."}
{"text":"I have to say, I am not a pub person but from time to time,  I do like to hang out at the pub with some friends for happy hour after a long day in the office.  I came here for half price wings night on Tuesday after work.  It was a good thing that I got here early to get a table because this place is extremely busy.  The longer we sat,  the line got longer and longer. We all ordered wings and a drink.  I ordered two pounds of wings and asked for two different  flavors - garlic parm and Mississippi honey bbq. I have to say I liked the Mississippi honey bbq better then the garlic parm.  The garlic parm needed more parmesan cheese. Our server was really nice and friendly. Overall this is a good place for half price wings and happy hour after work."}
{"text":"The food here is good and the staff is friendly. They are under new management and they have a lot of work to do. You can find some dust flying around the air the but a little dust never hurt anybody :) 

Hope the new management can improve this location ascetically cause that mouse trap by the service door doesn't help my already skeptical presentation of this St. Louis wings. 

But all in all the food is good just don't know if I trust it."}
{"text":"All the food I've had, I've enjoyed. Excellent wings. Love the menu layout. Fantastic nightly specials. I like the 3 course special on Saturday and the half price apps (I think it's Thursday)  service is very friendly, if sometimes not the most attentive.  I also really like their specialty cocktails. Mmmm....  Grown up root beer float....  

Don't get me started on the dill sauce. I could drink it with a straw."}
{"text":"After a bad experience some months ago, a friend insisted we give this location a second chance. Drinks were decent, the service was nice, but the wings were again dry to the bone. No amount of sauce could help them from being like shoe leather.

Overall, I still hear my friends rave about St Lois wings, but they have not been to this location. Somehow St Louis has convinced yelp to delete the older bad reviews about this particular location in hopes people might consider trying it again."}
{"text":"Waitresses (short brunette) here really need an attitude check. 

I understand you're busy but a simple answer to \"do you have any availability?\" would certainly appreciated. 

With so many other options ill be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"The most horrible food I ever tried 
Wings weren't fresh but i ate few
I got sick that night and vomit to morning 
I am highly recommend to avoid this place"}
{"text":"My group of friends and I alternate between this location and the one on Dufferin (South of Finch Ave), depending on the number of our party. On this visit, we had 32 in our group, so they sat us upstairs in the lounge. Upon entering around 10:30pm on a Friday night, our table was ready as the place was only about 1/4. Our server let us know ahead of time that we need to group in 4's or 8's so that the bill will be easier to manage - as this isn't our first time there, we readily agreed.

I personally ordered a basket of fries and a pint of Keith's, while some friends ordered wings, deep fried pickles, etc. Our server was kind, level-headed, got our orders correctly and repeatedly returned to each tables to see if there was anything missing or we needed water re-fill. The food and drinks arrived well and we had a great time!

My only concern: 2 bathroom stalls for women and the cleanliness of it. 

I'm sure my party will come here again in a few weeks!"}
{"text":"I'm being generous with 1 star. The service was  beyond brutal. We've been here for 3 hrs with kids and still no food. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Really like this Louis location. Ive tried everything from wings to poutine, chicken burger, Cobb salad etc... And honestly can't complain. 

Staff are great, always friendly. Best patio in the beaches for the sun. Beers are always nice and chilled too!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there tonight. Had the Hogtown tacos. Big mistake. Was absolutely infect and uneatable. Where one would expect pulled pork, I instead got little cubes of what appeared to be ham soaked in an over-salted bbq sauce, along with a few strips of bacon. The soft taco shells had long lost any softness. Disgusting would be putting it mildly. 

My wife had the turkey club. How on earth can you screw up a turkey club? At St Louis Bar, they manage to do that. And the French fries? They were memorable for their fat-induced limpness. 

I have instructed my kids to have me institutionalized if I  ever mention going there again."}
{"text":"My \"go to\" drink spot in North York other than HY Lounge.  The waitress's are cute and friendly (very important).  Drink prices are very reasonable for the area.  If it's busy downstairs you have the lounge upstairs.  Lot's of big screen TV's to catch sports on.

Stick with the wings and fries.  Haven't had any good experiences when trying anything else on the menu.  Pulled pork poutine they had a while back was just a mess.  Don't think they have it anymore.

Week nights or weekends are always a good time to go."}
{"text":"Usual pub grub.  But  good drinks list.  Highly recommend their exclusive Lindt chocolate cheesecake."}
{"text":"always my favorite bar to drink and catch up with friendz! Wings are especially great ! Had been here a couple times"}
{"text":"Had lunch team here last Friday and it's the second time we've been there. 

They are the few places that can do separate bills for large groups and pretty quick services.

I had the Chicken & waffles and it's pretty good! The waffles were kinda sweet because they put sugar on them which I think it's a bit extra. The chicken is juicy and it went well with the waffles. 
My other colleagues ordered their wings specifical, 14.99$ for 14 wings with purchase of a drink (alcoholic or non alcoholic). The wings were surprisingly good! (They offered me some) 

Overall, it's a good place to go for team lunch. Food is up to bar and services are efficient as well. Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"Took my brother and elderly father for lunch. 

Decent wings but fries were cardboard. The waitress was very helpful and friendly. 

Patio was excellent. 

Would come back for beer (and maybe wings) on the patio if I was in the area, but I would not take a special trip."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner so I go to this place once in a while, but not frequently. 
Its a regular wing place, nothing to write home about. They have a good patio that just got renovated for the summer. Their service is decently prompt. The wings are ok, nothing special again. Can't go too wrong with this place as its very consistent but you won't be blown away either.
They have daily specials which are good deals but otherwise the regular prices are just normal."}
{"text":"Came at 10.30pm and we still had to wait. Location was pretty small and it was also half price wings night so that's understandable. Service was good and fast. Got hot and honey and it was not hot at all. My tolerance for spice is pretty higher so that's probably why it wasn't hot at all. Wanted extra ranch but it's an extra $1 FYI."}
{"text":"Walked over from wonderland because it was Tuesday half price wing day and also cheaper to eat outside of wonderland. Food was pretty good but service could be better. My friend and I were gonna split a 2lb so it's cheaper but they didn't do that. They also brought us the wrong order. I ordered paala sauce wings but they brought Cajun instead. Also, paala has a 5 flame spice rating but it really isn't spicy at all. But it still tasted good though."}
{"text":"Ordered online and paid only to arrive and be told my order was not received and that I would have to wait for them to start cooking it. The whole point of ordering online is so that you dont have to wait. She barely offered an apology. I will never come to this place again."}
{"text":"On March 3rd I comment on the St. Louis Facebook page regarding an experience with the Sheppard and Yonge location.
Saturday March 2nd I called in at 12:50 pm to place a take-out order; I was put on hold by a guy who I presume English is not his first language. I think he forgot about me. I had my boyfriend call to the same number thinking there will be a second line but there was not. I was kept on hold until 1:17 pm then I gave up. I was really craving for the sweet potatoes fries and got a little upset so I called back the same guy picked up. I expressed to him how upset I was, he offered to rush my order but I was eating something else by then.Sorry I forgot to get his name.

I just think for such a popular location it will smart of them to get a second line.

a miss Christine from head office I believe replied my facebook post she said she forwarded my email to their regional manager. But no one followed up. So idk what they meant by \"we take our customers opinion very seriously\".

just wondered has this happened to anyone before? been left on the phone"}
{"text":"7:35
we usually go to buffalo wild wings majority of the time and thought to change the scenery and go to St.Louis wings ajax location. I am still waiting here for our food for a table of 4. we ordered 3 lbs of wings, onion rings and nachos, soup and it's taking over a 1 hr and 30 minutes and food hasn't come out yet. Apparently there is 2 waitress for 25 tables.
9:15
they gave us fried pickles and mozzarella sticks on the house as we are waiting too long for our order.
9:20
waitress came up to us and said that they ran out of chicken soup (that took 1 hr 20 minutes to let us know that?)
9:30
our food has finally arrived, finally got the soups, onion rings and nachos!! no wings yet!
9:40
wings finally arrive. we asked what was the issue of taking so long to get our food and she told us that there was a mix up in the kitchen. That is a over 2 hour mix up??

food quality was very basic and not for over a 2 hrs wait for food. 
Not a good first experience for me and most likely I will never eat here again. It was my mistake of trying to change the scenery!
don't know how to give negative stars so I have to resort to giving them 1 star that they do not deserve."}
{"text":"I used to come here almost every Tuesday for their wings special, but seriously though the line up is so bad and it's very packed/crammed inside. It was like the go-to spot for every Markham/Richmond Hill student and guaranteed.. you will bump into someone you know here so don't come on a Tuesday if you're not trying to make small talk that day haha. 

Not sure if it changed but the special I came here for was half price wings with a purchase of a drink on Tuesdays. It came with a side of fries and a dill/ranch/bluecheese kind of dip? I forgot. I prefer this in comparison to Wild Wings where you're given like 2 sticks of carrot/celery lol. However, their pop is very very very flat. It's also room temperature. Had to ask them to switch it a couple times but there's not much improvement. The service here is okay, I can understand that it's slower because of half price wings which is coool but it's pretty goddamn slow sometimes like ughhhhh.

Only complaint is there was this one time I was here with my friends, and we were seated beside a group of drunk men in their 50s. They kept harassing my friends and I but the servers that night did not stop serving those men alcohol, nor did they try to fix the situation when I brought it up. The waitress was also joking around with those men, allowing them to place their hand on her and such.. don't know why she would be okay with that. It's like she was trying to make them stay and spend more money or something. I honestly felt that the employees should've stopped serving them alcohol seeing that they were so drunk, and should've asked them to leave or at least try to move me to a different table. It just made me feel extremely uncomfortable to have strangers constantly touching my hair or grabbing my arm while I am trying to eat - I haven't been back here since that incident."}
{"text":"This place is really nothing special, but there's not much around the area - and every so often, the wings start calling my name. 

I do enjoy my meals from here, but I know what I'm in for, and that is greasy, calorie-laden, typical take-out food. 

I've been here a couple times to dine, and it is so quiet that its almost awkward to eat there. Its a very small location, and it feels weird being the only table being waited on. Keep in mind, I'm talking lunch hour here, so maybe it picks up in the evenings. 

I love the dill dipping sauce for the fries. I'm sure its very generic, but I love it all the same. 

As for wings, they are your regular run-of-the-mill wings, and my favourite flavour is honey hot. 

There's even a drive-through in this location, which I find odd (and never see it being used). Oh and FYI - they don't accept debit but there is an ATM at the entrance."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch!

There are daily lunch specials through the week, and I've found it pretty easy to get in and out at lunch.

The servers are friendly and the food is good.

I've been coming here since the summer and continue to enjoy it."}
{"text":"St Louis is well known for their wings and better known for their half price wings on Tuesday. You must purchase a large beverage (minimum 2.99 Pepsi) to get the deal. Although the price of wings has gone up substantially. One pound of wings was 15.75 and two pounds was around 25. So the Tuesday deal just makes it do-able. I would not go there otherwise on any other days. 

The place is small and crowded but if you're there before 730 you should be able to get a seat with minimal waiting."}
{"text":"Been here twice.. service sucks.. both times.. they made eye contact with me as I walked in.. and then that it for the next 10 minutes...

Both times I was the first to arrive among my group.. and both times I just sat myself down at a table.. even tho it says please wait to be seated..

Service is slow, the most recent time I was there, took me almost 15 minutes to get my first sip of beer.. mostly because they weren't attentive, I had to chase down a waitress, she had to find my waitress.. and the bartender had to pour it... 

All bullshit when it comes to simple service!!

Generally speaking.. the appetizers are bad tasting.. 

I would only come here for the wings.. cuz the services sucks and the food sucks.."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular at St Louis Yonge and Finch St Louis and Dufferin and Finch St Louis.

This location just doesn't compare.. the service is my opinion is slow and sub-par compared to Leslie and 16 location as well as those in North York.. Yonge and Lawrence as well as the one in Greek town on Bloor.

Been here a few times.. waitresses see me but it takes them an extra 1 or 2 minutes to do something about it..

This place also doesn't have the trendy vibe or lines ups that the other ones have...  

There aren't enough TVs or seating for that matter,  but then again this place is never full..

This location also closes early too.. and waitresses aren't young and fit - just imagine the opposite..

Overall, doesn't feel like a St Louis experience... feels more like diner in the boonies.."}
{"text":"This was a tough one for me to review. It was my first poutine and it was amazing. I don't have any experience to judge it against but I loved it. Patio was nice, service was decent. Waitress argued with me though about what was on happy hour. I told her there was a sign on the way to the bathroom and she said there wasn't. I finally just relented, but when I went to the bathroom took a picture of the sign to show the other guests at are table to they wouldn't think I was crazy. Other thing that cant allow me to give a 4 or a 5 was the stella was not served in a stella glass. In the big scheme of things, a big deal, no, but there's a specific glass for a reason."}
{"text":"Food was good. Wings are worth it on Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Great place compared to other bars in the area!! Clean and a great place to chill, Lars of people on the weekends especially on Friday and Saturdays."}
{"text":"Good people great drinks but food could use a little work for what I payed it was a little small but it was good I will give it that. People working there are great and the atmosphere is good it's a nice place to have a few drinks and watch the game with some friends"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for wings in Ajax.  The service is friendly and talkative.

Their wings are really well made but I'd say their fries are even better.  They are flat cut with a ripple running along the length of the fry.  They are meaty and perfect for dipping into their awesome dill pickle sauce."}
{"text":"This location has one of the better wings in my experience. Fries were on point like always!! Came here for half price wings on Tuesday, recommend coming here no later than 5 if you do not want to wait!
Service was terrible..asian girl with dyed blond hair was serving us. Had to wait 15 minutes to get her attention for the bill. Checked up on us (a party of 7) only once."}
{"text":"4 of us came to this location for Tuesday half price wings, expecting there to be a wait/line up. We put our names down and was told that the wait is approximately 40-45 minutes. 

We browsed around in the area and we returned to the restaurant after 40 minutes. I went to the lady that was taking names down and asked her how much longer the wait will be. She told me that we were the next in line for 4 parties. While trying to be patient and not starve to death, knowing we were next in line was good news. Just after I went back to tell my friends that the wait will not be long, we saw a party of 4 being called into the restaurant. Doubtfully, I went back into the restaurant and looked over the lady's shoulders to see the name list. I was shocked to see that there were almost half a page of names in front of us that were not crossed out, and among the names, at least 3 parties had 4 people...

We decided to stay and wait, since we've already waited for nearly an hour. After over an hour, we were finally being called and seated at a table that was empty when I first went to ask the lady about our wait time. 

On the bright side, our server was super friendly and took our orders in no time. St.Louis boneless is always my favourite and the food did not disappoint me. But after waiting for almost twice the amount of time of the estimated and being lied to about where we stood in the waitlist, I doubt I will be back at this location anymore."}
{"text":"First of all, I want to start by saying that I'm a huge fan of St. Louis in general. 
That being said, this particular location is really a let down and it makes it worse that it's the closest location to my home. 
I've been there about 3-4 times over the past 2 years and each time it never fails to disappoint.
The menu is extremely small and the quality of the food is atrocious. 
The wings came out dry and very very tiny. Way overcooked and so we're the fries. 
Don't be deceived by the amount of people in there as it's the only Sports bar by the Rogers centre. 
If you're looking to grab a drink, come on in. But if you're looking for food, you're better off going to shoeless joes down the street."}
{"text":"I've tried wings a lot of places and these are still at the top of my list! Probably just my preference, as I like wings that have flavour fused inside and I find most wings bland inside, except these! Also, the fries are amazing. And the dill sauce is out of this world. And the fries and sauce are included with the wings! Lots of great weekday deals like half price apps and half price wings. The burgers are also good but I never get them because I can't stay away from the wings. Definitely reccommend everyone tries it out."}
{"text":"I enjoy the patio here though it's nothing special... it's still a patio which is great in the summer!
Now, the food. Wings have never tasted so good. This place is my standard for all wings and I haven't found any to compare. The flavour penetrates the inside of the wings and there is no nasty breading. The fries and sauce are just as good as the wings.. I'd probably come for this even if the wings somehow disappeared. The burgers are good too but I never get them because the wings.. oh the wings!"}
{"text":"At least a 3.5 stars - giving it a 4-stars because the food was so good (and so was the company).

We met up with family at this restaurant, which is not huge by any means. We got a table for 4, and there is sports showing on TVs all around (watch your head - I nearly knocked myself out when I stood up!) Be forewarned: it gets LOUD in here!

The restaurant is attached to the Fairview Mall near the Sears store on the upper level, and doesn't seem to be accessible from inside the mall. We parked in the wrong place, then discovered all of this once we got into the mall. There were plenty of mall parking-lot spaces right outside the restaurant. The restaurant faces the street.

The service was a mix of ok and good - we saw a gentleman server have a mishap with a bottle of beverage on a tray: he went one way, the bottle went the other, and out of the spout poured the bevvie - right down the back of the coat and jacket of 2 of the guests! OOOops - not good! On the other hand, our server was chearful and helpful (she even helped him clean up!) They were a little slow bringing the bill, even though the place was starting to fill up and they really needed our table for the next guests!

The food was good enough that I might try coming here again."}
{"text":"After Woofstock, I had a late lunch/early supper at St. Louis.  I sat on the patio ... it was fairly quiet compared to those on Front Street which were jammed.

After walking around for a couple hours in the heat, my cold Keith's tasted goooood!

I ordered a pound of hot wings and fries.  They were delish!

The servers took good care of me.

It was a nice patio to eat, have a beer and read my book ... until three women came by and sat at the other end of the patio.  Due to health regulations, they couldn't bring their dogs onto the patio so they tied them up right behind me.  They were so stressed being so far away from their owners and barked the whole time.  Poor babies!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at St. Louis in Mississauga.  I've been to this location in the past and enjoyed it.  I got there early and just before the lunch rush.

I ordered what I always get at St. Louis ... a pound of plain wings and fries.   And they were good.

My server was Paulina.  She was friendly and took good care of me!"}
{"text":"I conducted a seminar, followed by some one-on-ones this morning by the airport.

I had lunch at St. Louis, which wasn't too far away.  I love St. Louis' wings and hadn't had them in a while.

This location is in a weird cold strip mall on Dixon, a bit of a long drive off the road.

The patio was big and sunny ... there were a few people catching some rays.

It's a cavernous restaurant with lots of space.  I sat in the bar area.

I love their wings and have never ordered anything else.  I got a pound of hot wings and fries along with a Diet Coke.  There were only seven wings but they were a good size.

Lunch was good as was the service (the bartender took care of me)."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at St. Louis in Ajax.

I usually get their wings (I love their wings!) but got the bucket special for a change.

There were three riblets, three breaded buttermilk wings, three boneless chicken pieces and fries.

It was just okay ... it was nice to have a variety, though.  But I like their wings better so will get that again in the future.

Caley was my server.  She was friendly and took good care of me."}
{"text":"I spent the last day and a half at a conference downtown.  After it ended today, I had lunch nearby at St. Louis.  I love love love St. Louis' wings and their dipping sauce. 

The last time Gord and I were there was in November 2012 and we didn't have a good experience.  I swore I'd never go back to this location.  But I thought I'd check them out today and hoped maybe we'd just gone on an off-night.

I ordered what I always order ... medium wings.

Because this is a wing restaurant, I was surprised that it took 35 minutes for my meal to arrive after I'd ordered it.  The wings were overcooked (so were a bit dry) and oversauced ... their wings usually do have sauce on them but these had more than usual.

So not a great meal again and I mean it this time when I say I won't be back at this location."}
{"text":"We had lunch today at St. Louis Bar and Grill.  I love love love St. Louis' wings and their dipping sauce.

We got there just about noon.

Sister Sarah and I both ordered wings and fries.  She got hers mild saucy and I got mine medium dry.  They were good!

Carrie was our server.  She was friendly and took excellent care of us!"}

{"text":"Big fail on their online ordering.  What's the point of ordering and paying ahead only to have them miss it completely?  They didn't even offer anything to compensate.  After double-checking that we didn't send the order wrong (also a bit insulting), we got stuck waiting another 20 minutes.  All this for mediocre wings, that despite being ordered \"saucy\", had almost no sauce on them.

We won't be back..."}
{"text":"Been here twice only because my husband wanted wings . I understand most place are serving nothing made in house but at the very least take the hard crusty stuff off the ring of my soup bowl after you microwave wave the crap out of it.

{"text":"One of my favourite bites in the city. The deep fried pickles are amazing... And I don't like pickles that much."}
{"text":"Ok so here is the deal - El Hornero is an Argentinean restaurant. People who order pizza or lasagna thinking the place is \"Italian\" make me laugh - quite a bit. Sorry guys! :-)

To give a little more prospective, Argentina is a country occupying the lower half of the South America, and has deserts and jungles in the North, with penguins and glaciers in the South. They have more people there for less territory than Canada has, and there are about 4 cows per each one person of the 37.5 million population. Which means - those guys really eat meat, hardcore.

I lived in Argentina for about 8 years and can tell you that they know a lot about dealing with meat, milk, and everything a cow is about. A process of preparing an \"asado\" (sort of bbq, but a really cool one) takes hours and requires some special training. If you only know how to make some (khm) ribs, and think you are good at it, better don't try to get a job in Argentinean restaurant - you will be laughed at, and that will hurt.

Argentinean bife (yeah, that's how they call what \"stake\" is supposed to be) is a result of a thorough application of art and science. If you ask it medium-rare or something, you will be thought about as a person who doesn't have a clue. That's business, oh yeah, so they will serve you whatever you've ordered (including pizza and pasta) but... well I hope you've got a point.

There is some homework to be done before going to El Hornero. At least a google search and hopefully some reading about \"asado\" would help. Next step will be to get to the restaurant and order something you think you know what it is. May hurt, but your second attempt will be better, believe me!

As a big hairy A goal, you will make it to something which for the stranger may look like a portable stove with actual flames burning, and a pile of dead cow private parts slowly frying on top of it. At that point you may know what \"churrazquito\" is about, and maybe even dream about a \"chinchulin\", carefully looking around for some feds from the healthcare trying to protect your body from a certain damage.

When you will get to a \"chimichurri\" (and realize that it means \"give me curry\") and think about \"ensalada criolla\" as a viable alternative to \"fritas\", you may possibly notice a guy approvingly looking at you from the corner. That might be me. And a dude standing next to me and looking as a cook will probably be an asadero - an actual Argentinean national, and the owner of that place who stopped by my table just to chat a little bit in \"castellano\" (no, they do not call it \"Spanish language\").

At that point you will be good enough with all those little Argentinean peculiarities and ready to become friends with whoever is worth it, enjoying a one of a kind food impossible to find anywhere else in Toronto. Simple as that.

Saludos hermanito, 'ta bien si lo hiciste, felicidades! ;-) Y, naturalmente, \"no llores por mi, Argentina - tu alma esta conmigo!\" :-))"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a quick pint in between errands. Just your typical no nonsense bar and grill. I enjoyed the music playing on the stereo and the server was nice. The three stars is for the $10 pint (after tip). This isn't a luxury hotel lobby bar. It's a tiny bar in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Love the fries
Wings are decent
Prompt and kind service
Nice decor
Several televisions"}
{"text":"Friendly waitress.  Great wings but better value during happy hour and/or based on daily specials.  Location is small compared to other locations so be prepared for waits during happy hours and Tuesday wings happy hour."}
{"text":"Sat down with a few friends around 5pm after work...

Waited 10 mins to just be spoken to.

Waited another 10 minutes for drinks.

Waitress tried taking our order then walked away to go get a pen and paper (we were just ordering burgers and beers). 

Older waitstaff that just seemed not to care. We asked about a wing flavour and she said oh I don't know I don't eat them. 

Once the food order was in it came out pretty quick. Waitress didn't ask us for refills, and we were certainly open to having many pints. We headed down the road to an establishment that wanted our money."}
{"text":"I love the food at St. Louis. My favorite bar type food. The wings come with fries with dill sauce. Amazing.  Fish taco are also quite good. 

They have daily specials which are usually a decent deal. 

This specific location have an awesome owners. I'm not there that often but every time I arrive they always remember me. Very welcoming as I see them doing this with other customers. Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times...

The consistency of the wings can vary.  I prefer them to be slightly saucy.  Sometimes they can come out a little dry or overdone but the fries are great. The dill sauce is amazing! I have a tough time deciding \"do I dip the fries in the dill sauce, or use ketchup\" ... 

9 times out of 10 the wings are perfect.

Tip: Large Hot + Fries if you're really hungry!  They also have lunch specials for before 3pm."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Even though the venue is fairly small, the staff treat you like family! Service is amazing! Not only do they check up on you regularly but they also accommodate large groups with ease. Highly recommend this place for a relaxing night out or to watch any sporting event!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of going here on Monday. And you know what Mondays mean? 15 boneless chicken wings, fries and a pint of beer special for $16. Pretty good deal considering 15 boneless wings are $17.50. I actually enjoy the boneless wings here and not many places offer this style of wings. And they're pretty good as well. They even let you have 2 flavours of sauces for your wings. The fries are one of the best that I've had at wing places.

It's unfortunate how St. Louis was understaffed and we noticed it more significantly when we were trying to pay since all of us wanted to pay card so the waitress had to keep leaving and coming back to handle our payments.

Everyday they have different specials so make sure you take this into mind when planning when to go. It can be busy during the prime time hours so be aware!"}
{"text":"2 things I like and don't like

Food: No complaints about the food here at all. My go to is 1 pound of smoked bbq heat wings and it's always great, especially with the crisp golden fries and the amazing dill sauce. Other great flavours are hot&honey, buffalo ranch and sweet asian bbq.

Service: What can I say? No matter the time, it seems like it's a very long wait to get seated, whether the restaurant is packed or not. Not only that, but the wait to get the food is equally as long which makes it difficult to come here if you're looking for a quick meal."}
{"text":"I went on a Food x Beer crawl in Aurora with my friends and one of the better spots to enjoy the pair would be at St. Louis Bar & Grill, located at Bayview / Hollandview :) The best days to go IMO would probably be Tuesdays for 1/2 price wings, and Thursdays for 1/2 price appetizers!

We were there last night Thursday ^^ Very happy to see that even poutines were 1/2 priced too and the portion was huge (great value!) We also ordered 'Devil' sized beer (I don't remember the exact name... but it is like super sizing your beer lol). Apparently, the price was even better than getting a pitcher ;) And our group of 4 shared the following:

Chicken noodle soup
- hearty soup with chunks of ingredients
- not part of 1/2 priced apps
Riblets
- delicious, came out pipping hot
- comes with bbq sauce
- absolutely not dry at all
Cauliflower bites
- lightly battered
- comes with a sweet chili sauce
- ordered it bc we must eat our veggies lol
Calamari
- I enjoyed this the most :)
- you usually can't go wrong with calamari lol
Pulled pork poutine
- St. Louis's fries are always to die for :)
- very tasty with chucks of cheese curds.
- pulled pork was a bit too spicy this time around
Bacon wrapped Mac n' Cheese balls
- pairs well with my beer ;)
- comes in 2 skewers of 3s

I would definitely come back again. St. Louis does have specials everyday, come check them out for yourselves :) Our lady server was also very friendly, courteous and attentive! See y'all next Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just crave wings. 
And sometimes one must give in to these cravings. 

After five hours of recording in a studio (school work + band recording=fun but tiring) me and my crew were ready for a drink and some food. 

What was around the corner? St. Louis Bar and Grill. 

Dudes! On Thursdays it seems to be half price appetizers! Unreal!

Jalapeno poppers $8 = $4
Fries $4 = 2

I love me some deals. Add a large order of honey and heat wings plus some beer and you got yourself a meal for four. 

Gourmet? No. Hits the spot when craving wings? Yes. 

Oh and the staff is nice too."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. I use to come here all the time and St. Louis has just been going downhill while the years pass. Whether it's the service or even the food. The drinks are super water down..... there's only one person working so she's serving everybody while making the food.... there's really not much to it... I just have to find a new spot for better wings and service."}
{"text":"Cool location, a little more central than the others that I've been to, a sports bar downstairs with a sports lounge vibe upstairs. They've also got a nice patio upstairs on the second level which is pretty appealing in the summer months. People complain that the wings are small but at least they're all meat and not all fat/skin. I'm a fan of the flavours as there are quite a few options, but nothing as redundant and overdone as All Star's or Wild Wing. St Louis really wins me with their fries. Perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, and interestingly wave-cut. The house sauce that comes in the plastic package is also a signature that separates St Louis from the rest."}
{"text":"Not really sure why everyone else had such an issue with the service. Whenever I've come here it seemed pretty average but nothing to complain about. This location is somewhat of a local watering-hole, but the wings are pretty good. People complain that they're small but at least they're all meat and not all fat/skin. I'm a fan of the flavours as there are quite a few options, but nothing as redundant and overdone as All Star's or Wild Wing. St Louis really wins me with their fries. Perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, and interestingly wave-cut. The house sauce that comes in the plastic package is also a signature that separates St Louis from the rest."}
{"text":"A fairly new location, much cleaner and more modern than the location at Oxford. A but more of a sports bar vibe here, and the service is a little better. People complain that the wings are small but at least they're all meat and not all fat/skin. I'm a fan of the flavours as there are quite a few options, but nothing as redundant and overdone as All Star's or Wild Wing. St Louis really wins me with their fries. Perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, and interestingly wave-cut. The house sauce that comes in the plastic package is also a signature that separates St Louis from the rest."}
{"text":"Warning: this place is horrible! I can't believe anyone finds the food of this franchise appetizing! Having gone to  Fairview mall and not knowing what other resturants are nearby, my party and I decided to dine here. There were three tables with patrons, while the bar was full. Clearly, this was the watering hole. It was a disaster! My friend ordered the angus beef burger, which she said lacked a smoky BBQ flavour and did not compare with other places we've been to. I had a bite and could attest to the fact that something was off. I could taste the cow in the burger! It was so bad, I had to wash it down with Chipotle sauce. My sweet potato fries were ok. Their regular fries were by far the best out of both our meals; freshly made, huge potato wedge cut, steaming and flavourful. I ordered tacos based on recommendation by our server and was hugely disappointed. Besides the great wait staff, this place scores very low on places to go, especially to eat. I was thankful for not getting sick as that was my main concern after our experience. Never again. I will not step foot into any St. Louis establishment ever, even if you paid me!"}
{"text":"Like always they never disappoint me with their chicken wings. I always go there on Tuesday with half price wings. The service is always the same even if it is crazy busy."}
{"text":"My partner and I have come here a few times this year. Our last visit was on a Friday evening. We were seated immediately and served water right away. Whenever our server was busy, another one stepped in. We had multiple servers throughout the night, which is uncommon.

Our orders were taken shortly after being seated. It took about half an hour to get our food (which is the average). I ordered the garlic dill chicken burger (with crispy chicken) and my partner ordered the chicken lettuce wrap. The servers kept apologizing about the long wait, which we didn't notice.

The chicken burger was spicy and flavourable. The fries were crispy and crunchy. My partner found the lettuce wrap flavourable as well, which you don't find in most low calorie dishes.

One of our servers gave us her employee discount to compensate for the allegedly long wait. 

I would recommend this place - great service and decent pub food/drinks."}
{"text":"This review is based on our experience during the world Cup finals Sunday afternoon. Brought our 10yr old soccer fan along to cheer on her fave, OZIL and the outcome didn't disappoint along with her approval on every calorie bending eats she stuffed her anxious face with.

Not much we could do about the choice of location since last minute change of plans screwed up our German accuracy on time of departure, hence St. Louis as every bar was expected to house capacity. 

Nevertheless, we were lucky enough to score a table despite the owner having immense false insight that our bill would fall short compared to the group of beer thirsty fans behind us in line. Hah! My little one could eat with a digestive system of a teenage boy, and that SHE DID so I'm sure his decision was later taken on as intuitive business mojo orrrrr maybe because my daughter angrily glared at him with her Deutschland Jersey. 

Order up: beef tacos, 3lbs of half jerk and mild wings, nachos, burger, 4 YES 4 large orders of Cesar salad(insert ironic applause here), deep fried cheesecake, calamari, beer for the hubby and I and plenty of iced tea for the mini. My small fam of 3 went at it and feasted throughout the heart pounding game of off-sides and corner kicks only to belch in time for the German win! 

3 stars for the quality of chicken, hard and chewy and cold fries. The bright side, our waitress was very attentive and accommodating and never missed a beat with every princess-like request from our very happy fan. Thanks St. Louis!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small busy spot on Yonge St. Consistent with others in the chain. I enjoyed the wings and ribs combo. Both were moist with lots of meat. Choice of several sauces. Onion rings were tasty and the serving is big enough to share.Servers are pleasant and attentive. A bit pricey but I was satisfied."}
{"text":"We come here often to fulfill our chicken  wing cravings. Great wings, lots of TVs to watch the games. Come here on Tuesday's for half price wings. Prefer this location far more than Scarborough town's St Louis."}
{"text":"Food is decent, love how its a decent lunch spot, family dinner joint and a decent bar til close. Duffs is better but St Louis offers much more in regard to atmosphere. Usually run into at least one person i know every time i'm there. A neighborhood place that is great to just stop by for a beer even if you aren't eating. Probably the best patio in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great wings, beer and superb service - Stephanie our waitress was super friendly and always checking in."}
{"text":"I can't really understand why the reviews are so bad for this place but it doesn't seem that many people have given this place a chance.

I haven't been to this St. Louis location before but I've been to the one in the Atrium downtown (fabulous) and the one in Pickering (less than fabulous). St. Louis doesn't have a ton of flavors - that's not their shtick. They have well-sized wings and a large menu so that if someone doesn't want wings, they can most certainly have something else. This location isn't huge but its big enough and wasn't too busy on a Wednesday night at dinner (although more people did start streaming in as we finished up).

Like other St. Louis location, its generally a seat yourself deal, but we were greeted by a server immediately who invited us to pick where we wanted to sit. Our server came over right away and informed us of the specials (be sure to check out their daily specials because they're worth it - so is their longer running specials), which included a steak sandwich for $9.99 (four bucks off) and cheap beer of some kind. They also had a special running for maple ribs and wings WITH a pint of Canadian for $16. That's a pretty great deal but since I don't drink beer and my boyfriend wasn't in the mood for maple anything, we didn't go for it. I got my usual, a pound of honey garlic wings with fries and he ended up with the steak sandwich.

One of the stand out things I've always found at St. Louis is that they're speedy as hell. We couldn't have been sitting for that long before our food came out (given it wasn't too busy but it was still very fast). I got a smallish basket filled with fries and wings and a dill dipping sauce, and the boyfriend got a small plate with his steak sandwich and fries on it. Again, our server was great, really attentive, making sure we were happy with everything and getting drink refills and dipping sauce as we asked for it.

Onto the food - my wings were pretty good, as expected. St Louis does their wings a bit differently I think because the chicken is always a little crispy on the outside but moist on the inside. Great flavor on the honey garlic, not too much of either and not too much or too little sauce. Hard to get that balance right but they nailed it. The fries here are wicked, kinda crispy on the outside and soft on the inside but you can't stop eating them!!!! And the dill sauce just makes everything that much better. I dip everything in it - I don't care if its prepackaged like someone else noted - at least you know its not sitting around in a vat in the kitchen in open air!! My boyfriend's steak sandwich was HUUUUGE for $10! The steak itself was pretty thick, it was done perfectly and he ate the entire thing. We also appreciated that the server noted it was typically served as an open-faced sandwich but offered to give him the extra bun on top if he wanted (which he did). 

I also have to note the portion sizes here. When she put down the small basket, I was like what? But when you dug into it, it was just FULL of goodies. Lots of fries, LOTS of wings for $12 and I could barely finish the fries. The same happened with my boyfriend and his steak sandwich.

Overall, a pretty good wing place to hit up if you're not into trying billions of wing flavors or if you like to keep it simple with the basics. The dill sauce is part of what makes this place great so be sure to get lots with your wings. St Louis has reasonable prices, great portions and good food. Don't go in expecting to have a wing-epiphany, this isn't the place for that. But for less than $30, we both ate until we were full and enjoyed every bite. We'll be adding this place to our wing joint rotation."}
{"text":"I LOVE St. Louis Wings... but not at this location.

There's a location across from my work in the Atrium and its absolutely fantastic every single time I order it. Cannot complain when you order from there.

I had a friend in town and had been raving about the wings at St. Louis (and the dill sauce YUM) and when I discovered there was one in Ajax, that was it. Decision made. 

The wings were lacklustre. They were overcooked, too crispy and lacked flavor. Whoever was saucing them up was being stingy with the sauce and overall, I was so so disappointed with the wings. I did try it one more time and they were marginally better but still overcooked."}
{"text":"this place was great! a friendly server and food consistent with all other St. Louis locations. 

I was thinking to give this place just a regular 3 stars since nothing stood out to me at first and the restaurant layout/atmosphere wasn't so great (just lookin out at a parking lot) but the waitress was really nice and cheerful and she gave us new drinks before we even finished ours (which is a super plus :D) so here's 4 stars !"}
{"text":"I'd give this a 0 if I could and I will explain why.. Finished worked around 6 got here at about 7ish and ordered some food and drinks. Our drinks came at a reasonable amount of time.. But our food? Well 20 minutes later we still haven't received anything..people that ordered after us were getting their food.. So I was thinking maybe a mixup in the kitchen.. Another 30 min goes by and now we were just simply annoyed, a massive group came in maybe 30 min after us and they all started getting their orders. We called the waitress over and she said it would be out shortly so in total we waited 50-60 min and we told her we are canceling it and she offered to comp it for us, at this point we were both really hungry and annoyed so we just asked for the bill for our drinks but she comped it. This was a Sunday afternoon as well (if it makes any difference). We ended up going to hero burger with a total wait time of 5-8min."}
{"text":"TLTR: bad customer service, burnt wings and watered-down soda

Went on a Tuesday for half priced wings w/ a purchase of a large drink. Went around 7:30 and took us until 8:15 for us to get a table. They sat us at a tiny small square table for three people.

When we were about to order food, our first waitress was taken away to help another table, so another waitress was told to take our order. I ordered an iced tea and 2lb breaded wings with honey garlic and sweet Asian BBQ (both non-spicy). They ran out of iced tea so I had to change it to ginger ale. It tasted nothing like ginger-ale by being watered-down. 

When the food came, the chicken looked really dark compared to the other two batch. After trying a few pieces, it tasted burnt and dry. We were trying to call the waitress, but she did not even look our way. It took us 20 minutes to finally call her over and ask if it was breaded. She said no. (I ordered breaded) And if it's not breaded, is it usually burnt. (Just a curious question). She asked \"is it burnt? Does it taste burnt?\" I said yes. She took it to the kitchen, brought another batch back that was also burnt and just placed it on the table without giving me an explanation or apology. 

We wanted to get the bill and our server, once again, was not coming to our table. We had to ask another waitress to get the bill. 

Overall, would never come back again. Slow service, rude waitress and burnt chicken? No thanks."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for the Raptors games and sat upstairs. It wasn't busy an hour before the game started and then it got packed. We were surrounded by televisions so it was perfect for watching the game and everyone was into it.

The food was decent. Every starter was half price when the game started so we got the calamari, cauliflower and deep fried pickles.

The calamari was a bit too soft but we still ordered a second round since it was only 5 bucks and the dipping sauce was unique. The cauliflower was a bit mushy but my friend liked it.

My other friend and I ordered wings after and they're the same as every other St. Louis. The waitress was nice and attentive but I'm not sure if I'd come here again."}
{"text":"I've had waaaaay too many bad experiences here. I only kept going back cause it's close and I got free coupons to make up for the bad service that I had to use. If you just want a beer... and you don't care how long it takes... maybe you'll enjoy this place. Service is friendly but otherwise... my orders are usually wrong and food isn't prepared well (seriously how do you screw up wings!??). I won't be going back. This is just my experience."}
{"text":"This place isn't good but isn't bad either.  My boss use to order lunch from this place and i ate a lot of wings.  I enjoyed their little onion pieces.  So when i went to the restaurant, i had high expectations.

Wasn't busy there, went there a little after lunch time.  Ordered the combo platter, the chicken is a little dry, but I guess that's how they usually are.  Spacious, and has a patio so you could eat and drink outside.

Service was a little slow.  Only two waiters at the time, 1 served the patio customer and 1 served the customers inside.  My waiter would also serve the people outside too so at times there were no waiters to be seen. Overall, its ok, if your going for some beers, this is a good place, don't expect the best tasting food though."}
{"text":"Made a spontaneous decision to grab a quick dinner here after work on a Friday. My husband and 8 year old son met around 5:30 and we were greeted by a super nice server who went out of her way several times throughout dinner to interact with our son. The kids' menu looks pretty awesome. My son ordered the angus cheeseburger. It was a size fit for any grown up with a generous side of fries. Ice cream sundae for dessert. Yummy. My husband got the buffalo chicken wrap with fries which was nicely presented. No complaints. The big surprise was my lobster nachos. At $12.99, with a menu description of \"personal size\", my expectations were low, but it was a piled up, heaping serving of light crispy chips, cheese, veggies and lobster in a stylish personal sized baking dish, complete with pot holder! The amount of lobster on top of this treat was much appreciated, as I don't generally expect restaurants to be generous with seafood ingredients. We also like how the big screen TVs were set on different channels and free wifi is available too. Around 7 pm it started filling up  so we left to free up a table. Great experience all around."}
{"text":"I've been a long time patron of this location, even if there is no parking around. :) I just come when the weather is nice and park on a side street. I use the walk back to the car to burn off whatever delicious meal I just ate...! 
So, normally I'll get the wings here since they are my kind of wing. Not too big or small, just the right size and while I'm not a spice person, I like honey garlic and it's hard to mess that up. This past time I went was on a Wednesday, and wouldn't you know it...on Wednesday's, it's $5 burger and fries day. BURGER AND FRIES FOR $5!! I know what you're thinking...what kind of burger do you get at a wing place? Answer: A GOOD one! It was not a dry puck, it was likely not handmade from the heart but it was delicious nonetheless. I'm not asking for a gourmet burger for $5! I love their french fries and especially dipping them in their dill dip. Yum yum. I'm hungry just reliving the meal! 
We had to sit inside because the patio was packed, but I'm secretly an indoor eating preferrer anyway. Love this place! I also saw Tarzan Dan here once, so +1 star."}
{"text":"Our server was lovely! The wings are good. I tried a couple of ribs and even though they were plain with the optional creamy dill sauce, they were pretty good. Salad, not so much.

I asked for more flats instead of drummets in my wings and I got all flats. Nice! Some places don't let you choose and just give you what they want.

They just got Somersby on tap and all the servers were excited so I decided to try it. It was great! I much prefer it over Strongbow.

Excellent service, pretty good food, tasty alcohol. It was a good visit!

FYI they have a Yelp check-in offer. No one who works there has heard of it for some reason but they honor it. If you buy a rib or wing dinner you get an appetizer free. They also have daily specials throughout the week."}
{"text":"Best wing poutine ever! Took my friend here and he has never had poutine before so he tried mine and fell in love, he ordered one for himself the next time we went. Hands down best place for poutine to dine in at, love going here"}
{"text":"Decently priced, good size portioned food plate. I have the st.louis wings poutine and have to tell you it was SO good. It was really filling too for only 10.99. They also serve liquor at this location. Which I happened to have to accompany my dinner really friendly staff, I had the best server ling ling. This location offers free underground parking. I do highly recommend others to go here."}
{"text":"Dined here for lunch on a weekday as 1 of 2 tables being helped. Noticed right away that the vibe was atypical of other locations - the staff weren't clad in suggestive clothing and dressed plain or at least appropriately for the weather (-20C). We were walked through our menu even though we've eaten at St. Louis countless times. Less-than-sports-bar feel. Different but good.

Enjoyed an order of all-day 1/2 price wings in hot sauce. The usual.

Though the service and food were quite regular, the restaurant temperature was unbelievably cold. Accordingly my mouth was reacting to the heat of the food and the spiciness but the rest of my body was so frozen I had to wear my puffy coat inside. Observing other customers, everyone had hands and arms tucked or were nearly shivering to keep warm. I didn't say anything but it seemed like the glass walls made for terrible indoor temperature control. I could have sat to digest my food another minute but I wanted to get moving stat as it was so cold. 

Anyway... would come back for the daily promo!"}
{"text":"..was craving for some good wings last TUESDAY night and ended up at St. Louis Bar & Grill at Bramalea Location. WINGS ARE HALF PRICE with an order of a beverage!!! (1lb=12.99 & 2lbs=$23.99 on a regular day) WE ORDERED GARLIC PARM WINGS & MISSISSIPPI HONEY BBQ. Soooo goood. Wings special already include a side of fries & their famous & SUPER DELICIOUS dip!!!! Offered from 4pm-close. The atmosphere was on point, staffs are SOOO FRIENDLY, service is fast. BEST WING PLACE AT BRAMPTON!! 

ONLY COMMENT: We werent offered any dessert. but thats okay. I forgot to ask anyways."}
{"text":"I need to lower my rating. My love for how tasty and consistent St. Louis wings are has not changed. It's the service that truly needs help.

The staff there are friendly. We were a group of roughly twenty folks saying goodbye to a fellow colleague last Tuesday. His manager booked a reservation for us.

Our software development team comes here often. Service at this establishment as of late has been bad.

It was Tuesday, meaning that you can get wings for half price. I ordered two pounds of wings. I chose honey garlic and sweet chili as my sauces. It came with fries. I also ordered a Diet Pepsi. I ate half my wings and packed the rest home when I finally got my order.

I placed my order at around noon. Our server was jotting down everyone's names. I thought that things were getting better service-wise. Nope. So wrong.

In our group, I was the last person to get my order. A fellow colleague came in later than I did (12:35 pm) and got her food first before everyone else!

I was the last person to get my food, waiting for over an hour. I thought that I was going to die. Luckily, I have enough fat stored around my belly that I snapped out of hangry mode! 

As soon as I heard my Brazilian developer say that his wings weren't what he had ordered, I knew that he was munching on my lunch order. Yep, she, my server, had given him my order. Ugh!

I finally got my order. My software development manager advised me to not give a tip. I rarely don't tip, but I had to. It was just not right.

{"text":"Your standard bar & standard bar food. Came here to meet my hubby after being downtown. The place looks okay. It's a bit crowded in some spots. The washrooms are small but clean. I shared an order of french fries & onion rings with hubby. They were decent. Nothing to rave about but also not awful. I've been to some bars that have horrendous tasting food. This wouldn't be my first choice for casual dining but it's not the worst. I will stay that the waitstaff were nice."}
{"text":"Terrible Saints place is hella small can't get around anywhere and the staff aren't friendly or helpful.  They have this thing where when they're full they take your number and call people when tables open up.  They said wait time is 1 hour .... who waits 1 hour for Saints I can say half the people probably won't be going there at 10pm and waiting in their cars or a closed mall.  Pointless didn't even bother after that as 2 or 3 empty tables and they're not seating anyone.

Lost my business rather go to the Saints on yonge atleast they don't do this there"}
{"text":"Server's are cute and the food is good. 
They have some great salad's if you're looking for healthier options but go mostly if you want some bar food and beers. I work just around the corner and have been more than a few times and haven't been disappointed yet.  
Never too crowded and there's always a seat available with a bar view."}
{"text":"Good place, solid food and good service we go there a lot for UFC nights but try to go to the bar upstairs much better atmosphere than the ground floor, better service and even the food."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why you all come to St. Louis but we come here because of their dip and fries! probably the best combo of fries and dip! Everything else is pretty mediocre, I do not like their wings at all! usually over cooked. The cocktails and the service are usually very solid! So generally speaking A-OK."}
{"text":"We've been to St. Louis Bar & Grill countless times.  This location isn't very large and tends to get very busy at dinner time. Tuesday (1/2 price wing night) is generally extremely busy and even more so if there's a game on, so expect to wait for a while to be seated. 

This is the only wing place we know of that serves free fries with their wings (even on wing night). The fries are outstanding and stay crisp throughout the whole meal. 

They have daily specials which can be found at http://stlouiswings.com/daily-specials/ 

We find the wings here are always cooked really well and we like that they aren't covered in any kind of batter or coating other than the wing sauce.

We've also tried a few of their other menu items and can definitely recommend the Cobb salad, which is packed full of veggies, meat, cheese and eggs.

Service is usually good, fast and friendly. We have found that at lunchtime the service can be a bit slow, but still very friendly.

The interior of the restaurant is like a typical sports bar, with seats at the bar, in the bar area and in the dining area. In the summer months they open up the patio area for more seating.

As wing places go, this is one of the ones we prefer and is very affordable on a Tuesday night when the wings are half price and there's often a beer on special."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience at this St. Louis, probably because it was basically empty. The server was very helpful and very accommodating throughout my dining experience. Also, the food tasted really great compared to what I initially expected. 

I took advantage of the Ribsanity promotion($14.99), which is 1/2 Rack of Ribs and Riblets with Coleslaw and 1 of 3 sides. The ribs tasted great, better than I expected. I chose Smoky BBQ as the rib sauce, but for the Ribsanity promotion you could have chosen 2 of 6 sauces. Surprisingly, the server was nice enough to provide me with all 6 sauces. I tried them and they were all good, especially Mixed Berry. The Riblets were pretty good and the Potato Salad side tasted alright. Overall, the Ribsanity promotion is well worth it. Also, I had a coupon for a free starter when I subscribed on their website, I got Sweet Potato Fries which tasted amazing. Server was also nice enough to supply me with extra Chipotle Mayo. 

I wasn't able to finish everything so I asked for some take-out containers and the server was nice enough to pack it herself.

Overall, Ribsanity is a great special to take advantage of and the server was one of the most helpful servers that served me."}
{"text":"This my new go to place for lunch and after work. Great specials every day (on Wednesdays you can get a domestic pint for $5.00 and a delicious Angus Burger that comes with a side of crispy fries for only $5.00.) No matter how busy it is, you can always seem to get a seat, but what I really like is the different daily specials, and the fast service, Yay, I am fan, and its a great place where you can eat well, eat cheap and not have to worry about burning your lunch hour waiting for your food. This is definitely the best St. Louis bar I have been too, the management here got it right when it comes to daily specials and fast service."}
{"text":"I am usually not a fan of franchise type sports bars, but I love this location. My friend came here on a very busy night last month (TFC, Leaf Game, and UFC fight were on at the same time) The bar was packed but were able to get a table after only about a 15 minute wait. Despite being very busy, the service was excellent, the food was great (we had wings and poutine) and prices were on par with everyone else. There are lots of tv's so you can see the action virtually from everyplace in the bar."}
{"text":"Great place to watch your favourite sporting event, as there are literally tv's everywhere.  They have a nice selection of beers on tap, as well great wings too, and nightly specials. The pitcher and 2lbs of wings Monday nights for $29.95 is a very good deal Uptown location is easily accessible by the TTC. I also found the servers here to be very efficient and friendly too."}
{"text":"This is one of the smallest St. Louis locations I have been too and I am giving them 4 stars right across the board. Great food, service and atmosphere as well great views of the tvs from almost every seat in the bar make this a great place to come to watch a game or socialize with friends.  Typical bar and food menu but in addition to their wings you really have to try their Poutine,  especially the chicken Poutine . If you are in the Streetsville area, give this place a try."}
{"text":"This was our first experience with St. Louis. My overall impression was of a chilled out sports bar. The only issue I had was with the space in this particular joint. Quite cramped up.

We were seated and attended to quickly and were promptly asked several times if everything was alright.

Wings were quite average to be honest but the veggie burger killed it for me. And yeah, I loved their signature big thick ... Hmmmm ... Wait for it ... Fries! 

Anyhoo, a fun evening!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this bar, it's got great service and is always a good time to hang out with friends to grab a few drinks. This place is VERY popular and is always full on any weeknight, which explains why there was a lounge built upstairs to accomodate for popularity. 

This St Louis is like every other St Louis out there since it is a franchise but the service here is FANTASTIC and very friendly. The food here is great (for bar food) and their famous dill ranch dip is simply amazing.

Onion Chips - These are soo delicious, they aren't onion rings they are tiny pieces of onion deep fried in a light fish and chips batter. 

Wings - Wings come in 1 lb or 2 lb and are generally tasty, can be dry sometimes but it doesn't matter because the dip tastes so good with the wings. My favorite flavors would be Honey and Hot or Smokey BBQ, they are classic wings not the oversauced breaded nasty wings you get from Allstars or something. They taste great especially with the dip.

Fries - These fries are AMAZING I love them. They are probably from frozen but they come out looking like big potato wedges but deep fried!

The environment, service and popularity of this place makes it the bar to be in the area. Locals love it, and all the other bars around the area suffer because of that. Be sure to come here for a few drinks on a night where you just want to hang out with some friends."}
{"text":"Went in to order 2 lbs of wings today. The bartender charged me for 2 separate 1 lb orders (which makes no sense to me, but mistakes do happen).
I proceeded to tell the bartender her error. All I got back was a lot of bad attitude. 
I even had to ask for my refund as she did not tell me that she processed one nor did she give me a receipt. 
So I had to ask for my receipt as well - she then thrust the soggy crumpled receipt at me.
Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Typical wing bar, the servers were super busy and seemed unorganized. Cheap drinks were nice but couldn't get a waitress to get new ones within a decent time. Having no UFC didnt help and the place smells like sour hobo. Won't return anytime soon"}
{"text":"The wings used to be better on Tues. Only come here during their wings deal but overall like superstar / bravo wings better. I have not tried their other food selection so this review is only on the wings.

Pretty small as well and the wait was a lot longer than it was a year ago. Guess its getting more popular."}
{"text":"This is my go to local bar, where I am always guaranteed a pitcher of Stella and a few pounds of awesome wings. The staff here is great, fast and super friendly, I officially love them all. My favorites food vise are hot n' honey wings, sweet potato fries and lots and lots of onion chips. Their signature dill sauce is a must for everything from wings to fries. The Ceasar is nice and spicy, but I like beer if you know what I mean. 
The space upstairs (the lounge) is where high school kids come to get some beer in hopes that their IDs won't be checked, and in most cases it works.
Overall a great local place with a lot more personal atmosphere than other locations."}
{"text":"The only reason that I would ever come here is only because of half-off wings Tuesdays!

Wings are half off with any drink purchase on every Tuesday. Just a heads up that line ups can get crazy long! Most of the time my group of friends and I would need to wait an hour to get seated, so we just chill at the McDonald's next door to wait. 

The wings might be the only good thing here, because everything else is quite mediocre. They have ribs, poutine and nachos but none were really outstanding. I do enjoy the wings, as they have a variety of sauces and seasonings to choose from.

Service can be a hit or miss. Sometimes I would get a friendly waitress but sometimes I would get one with a terrible attitude. It can get difficult to wave one down too, so make sure you order everything you need when you can. 

My friends and I ordered iced teas with our wings and when we finished we asked for a refill, which was included. However, what we got back was an extremely diluted iced tea that I wouldn't even call iced tea. They refilled our cups with plain water and no iced tea at all. We were about to leave so we didn't bother to complain. This may seem like a small issue, but refilling a soda with water just tells me that this restaurant is nothing but cheap. 

Overall, an okay place to go to but definitely not the best. Would love to find a new place for wings with better quality food and service. 

P.s. It gets super busy on Tuesdays, so come prepared and not starving!"}
{"text":"The wings are quite good and the price is quite reasonable, if you want to eat a lot I recommend you to go on Tuesdays after 4 and you'll get wings for a cheaper price.
I recommend for people that like spicy \"smoked bbq heat\" and \"medium saucy \" .
\"Hot\" and \"Caribbean\" are good spicy options as well 
Don't get \"\"hotter than hell\"
In terms of wet honey garlic, garlic parm and buffalo ranch are the bets"}
{"text":"Exceptional pulled pork sandwich great service awesome location across from the aquarium really enjoyed eating here during my recent travels from Nova Scotia"}
{"text":"Tldr: Solid wing deal on tuesdays, but long wait. Wings are not bad, service is ok. Would come back  from time to time. 

If you're from the Scarborough area, then you would know that on Tuesday's this location is mad packed for the half-price wings deal. The wait for a table is usually hella long, and the wait for your food is about the same. I only come to St. Louis for their wing deal so i'm not too sure about the wait during the other days. 

To get wings for half price, they require you to buy a beverage (beer, pop, etc.). I usually get 1lb of garlic parmesan, and 1lb of something new. The gar par is usually pretty solid, and the meat is relatively juicy. Though for the dry rub options, its not always consistent. My last visit i tried the lemon pepper and the seasoning is not bad, but i thought the meat was tougher to eat. The size of each wing is pretty standard as well. 

Service here was not bad, though my friends and i usually give them some slack as it's a full house every Tuesday. Is the deal worth waiting 20-30mins for a table, and another 30-40mins for food? I honestly don't know. Some days i think it's worth, some days i don't. I think it's really up to you if you're really craving wings. There are better places to eat wings, but the deal is the reason why i keep coming back. Oh... and also the thick cut fries, and the killer garlic dill sauce. That sauce is definitely imported from Mount Olympus or something cause it's pretty godly."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of St. Louis wings! I've been to a few of them, but went to the one here recently. I had the Garlic Parmesan and Buffalo Ranch flavour. The fries and their dip are sooo good - I'm always craving it! 

They also have specials everyday, and for the special on Thursday, was half price apps and we got the starter platter, which is a really good deal, and a great variety. The rest of the platter was okay, as I only liked the wings. Everything was deep fried, and quite salty. 

I've heard a few things of the horrible service, so I try to go on less busy days (any day but half price Tuesdays, so I can properly enjoy them haha)."}
{"text":"This location is fairly new and really well set up inside, love the open concept look with the huge screens and lighting! The food is amazing and this location is definitely one of the better ones! The staff is always friendly, attentive and service is amazing!"}
{"text":"I love the st. Louis chain because no matter which location you go the food taste the same. I came to this location with my boyfriend for half price wings and to watch the game. The entrance and bar area is a bit small (this place gets crowded). I had smokey BBQ heat wings with a side poutine. Spicy, smokey, lick your fingers type of wings! All the servers were extremely friendly and sociable. My Only complaint is the service. Even though they are nice they made far too many mistakes. I asked for a poutine and they brought me regular fries, then they brought me a poutine with no fork, I asked for blue cheese and receive regular side sauce and I had to ask for napkins. They were very apologetic and friendly but I'm sorry they need help in the department. Maybe they need more staff during peak hours."}
{"text":"Yum I'm such a fan of St. Louis menu! I'm a tad bias because I used to work there However, I've pretty munch sampled the majority of the menu and I am a fan. Wild wings does not even compare. I usually go for the wings with a side poutine ( smoke BBQ heat or Hot sweet Asian) or I really like their beef sandwhich with the \"au jus\". It's a super clean bar with TVs and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Well, I can't expect much. I mean

1. It's a franchise bar
2. It's a franchise bar
3. yeah...

I had some father-daughter time with my dad! We decided to have a late snack and came here at almost 10 p.m.

The service was slow. The lady brought us the wrong order. And since there was a game goin' on that night, there was a bunch of loud guys screamin' at the wide-screens. 

I tried the hot wings and calamari. Both weren't good. The fries that came with the wings were probably the best. Piping hot and fresh. The wings itself were okay. Suprisingly, I was able to handle the spice-level of 'hot' then again it's not like Gandhi's where it's serious about spice-levels. I love the dill sauce that comes with it for the fries, but I hate how you have to pay an extra .75 for one...wtf? As for the calamari, well it sucked. But I was expecting that from St.Louis so it's all good. Anyway, I only came here 'cause I had a $2 coupon off.. but yah, won't be comin' back. 

(LOL, it sounds like I was having a bad day as I re-read this, but it was really that bad.)"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at St. Louis especially this location, as two of my friends work in the kitchen so I come by to hang out and see them. The menu has improved from before, with a better selection and daily specials. It is known for its wings and ribs, but the burgers are also very good. My favourite part about the wings are the complimentary fries that come with it and the dill sauce. It's just not the same without the dill sauce! The waitresses are always very helpful and quick. The delivery and preparation of the meals are also generally fairly quick. There are a handful of TV's and you can get the waitresses to put on your show or sport of choice."}
{"text":"I do enjoy St. Louis wings however the service of the servers and hostess' at this location is of low quality. I will not be visiting this location again unfortunately. I have experienced poor customer service multiple times at this location but this was the final straw. My friend and I went on a rainy Friday night and the hostess took our number down then proceeded to tell just my friend and I that we could not wait inside near the door area even though she let the other customers wait by the door, forcing us to stand in the rain. When she called me 45 mins later to tell me there was a table available, I told her I left and that I wanted to give her my feedback but before I even finished my sentence she hung up on me.  If you want poor customer service, go here."}
{"text":"The place was fun to be at but the food pretty much sucked.  The bartender was a nice lady, she introduced herself and shaked my hand to introduce herself to me.  That is where the goodness ended. I ordered a small salad for $5 Canadian and the burger was advertised as $5 so I said okay. The salad came and seriously it was like airline small...tiny little salad that came out of a pre-mixed bag with nothing else.  Like 4 bies.  I asked to sub cole slaw in for the fries. When it came she had a little tiny cup of slaw and the fries.  She realized it and I said no problem, I will just throw myself on the those fries.  The burger was very uneventful, cooked more than through, no fresh patty here.  The fries which I shouldn't be eating were the best part, the slaw was not good. Then when I got the bill I was charged $1.99 for the  tiny cup of slaw, seriously??? It was like 8 cents worth, but whatever, I just paid the bill.  Wish I had driven somewhere, but it was a fun place to be filled with people.  Overall, if I had just read the reviews I wouldn't have gone there and I would suggest you move on."}
{"text":"Not the best place I have ever been. They suggested a burger for $5 bucks but it sucked and for the most part the rest of the food wasn't great. I didn't give them one star as the beer was fine and the staff were nice. The place has nice TV's and I am sure there are better things one the menu, but the house salad was out of one of the plastic clamshells you buy in the market but it was so small for $5 bucks it was a joke."}
{"text":"When visiting the Toronto area, my friend took me to his favorite spot near his work. When I first drove up to the place, I thought it was a small fast food joint, but walk inside, it's a whole different story. There's a full service bar, plenty of flatscreen tvs and eye candy to keep one entertained for hours. Oh yeah and the wings are great too. 

I haven't had a chance to try the other items on the menu aside from the wings but i'm sure the other items are great. Of the two times i've been there in a week, the place has been very busy. I've had my fair share of chicken wings at many popular chicken wing spots but i'd have to say this place is friendlier and more inviting than those places with owls and the buffalos. Come here for the wings, the drinks, and most importantly the ambiance. Can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"went on a friday night after watching Creed, which was quite an enjoyable move actually.

decided to try a new menu item.
Lobster Seafood Tacos. comes with a side of tortilla chips and salsa.
you 2 get soft tortilla tacos.  at the bottom, there's guac, then cajun dusted lobster and topped with coleslaw, shredded cheese, and green onion.

it was good but not great. the freshness of the lobster is definitely not be up to east coast standards. the portions were just right. filled you up enough, not american size portions.

also had some sweet potato fries. and i have to say. i really like the st louis fries and sweet potato fries. maybe it's the sauces. whatever it is, it's on point."}
{"text":"It's hard not to eat here when all your coworkers crave burgers and wings on a Wednesday afternoon, so I find myself eating here more often than not. I've got to say for a bar chain, they're doing far better than a lot of other bars I've ever been to.

Go there during lunch and they've got their daily specials for a decent price. Burgers are $5 on Wednesdays too. Makes you wonder how they can sell them for that cheap...

I like to mix it up each visit - chicken tenders if I'm feeling a little cheap, and the boneless wings if \"treat yo'self\" ever passes my mind. Their food is consistently well done. Tenders are always hot, juicy and crispy. Wings are crispy with just the right amount of sauce lathered. Wedges have that satisfying crunch (I needed a word other than crispy... felt weird saying it 3 times in 3 sentences...) and are really fluffy on the inside.

Servers in the area are always nice - haven't had a single bad one here yet (knock on wood).

Sports bar chains vary from place to place, so just because it's horrid somewhere doesn't mean it will be everywhere else!"}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend for their Wingsanity promotion a couple weeks ago. 

Purchase a drink and AYCE wings are $19.99. It's 1.5 pounds for your first round (comes with fries) and half a pound every round after that (no fries, but we didn't try asking).

Seriously? How the hell do you mess up one of your features this badly? Let's get specific on how embarrassingly awful this was. 

- Authentic buffalo wings had way too much vinegar/acidity in the sauce. I didn't finish even a single wing and had to literally set the basket away from me so I could breathe since having it in front of me felt like I was choking on vinegar fumes. 

- Franks Hot Dry Rub was way too salty. Barely tasted the hot sauce at all. This and the authentic buffalo were the biggest regrets. 

- Girlfriend tried the Buffalo Ranch as wings and as boneless. She said they were decent as wings. She liked the texture of the boneless, but for some reason the boneless were a lot saltier, as in too salty. 

 - Hot & Honey? Same as above, according to her. 

- Garlic Parmesan wings were the saving grace. So good. I don't know if the others being so bad made these ones extra better but they were delicious. 

- Fries were fine. Girlfriend liked them, I hated them. They're the big thick cut kind. Hit or miss based on personal preference. 

- The dipping sauce they serve with their fries (or wings, if you like that) is super yum. 

They have a rule that you need to finish all the wings before you get your next round. My girlfriend has an iron stomach and is just really good at eating. Otherwise, we wouldn't have made it, y'all. 

Service is friendly and efficient, but not enough to redeem their food. Oh, and don't get the iced tea, it's really extra sweet and artificial tasting. Kinda like Brisk meets piss. 

The best thing about this place? I never have to come back here, unless it's for that garlic parm."}
{"text":"Finally have a chance to visit this location...friendly service and great food, good place to chill with friends"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the wings at St. Louis Bar & Grill, and i really like this location's patio. I got the dry cajun and it was delicious and their dressing was awesome, especially with sweet potato fries. This is a fantastic place to chill and drink and have some wings in summer."}
{"text":"Disappointing and small wings.

A buddy and I had dinner here back in April and ordered 3 pounds of Wings and Poutine.  Both were disappointing.  The spicy flavors for the wings can be really spicy, so be careful.

It's not a bad place, but they are supposed to be known for their wings, and their wings were a let down."}
{"text":"Out of pasta, out of everything! Melted ice cream. Don't take your kids here. My poor kids left home hungry and we had to go to Subway to feed them. Blasting music like crazy. If you need a good place for family dinner - stay away! Very poorly managed place."}
{"text":"This place used to be semi decent, but every time I come back the bar is set even lower. I would say the majority of the staff are uninterested in serving customers, lazy and are not welcoming. I find the wings here hit or miss, quite often the are so dry and overcooked. Plus, a large order of wings is $27 now which I find is over the top. I have visited several St. Louis locations, and this spot is easily the worst."}
{"text":"Came here recently for their AYCE \"Wingsanity\" promotion. It's $19.99 +tax and tip, plus the purchase of a large drink (bottomless). It's just over $28 in total after everything. The deal is all right, though only worth it if you are planning to eat at least 2lbs of wings. They give you 1.5lbs to start, and 1lb on your refill (no fries or sauce after the first round, which to me, is fine). I had the chipotle-mango dry rub to start, and then the Mississippi Honey BBQ after. The dry rub isn't spicy at all and was a nice start to the meal because it wasn't overly dredged or sauced, so you're not as filled up by the second round. The Mississippi Honey BBQ isn't as sweet as the regular Honey Garlic, it's not as sweet, and has a bit of bitter-tartness to it. The wings were cooked very well and the meat just falls off the bone. 

While the service at location is inconsistent, it was quite pleasant today. The server was a stickler to the rules and did not allow any kind of sharing at all for the wing deal. I'd definitely recommend swapping out the side of fries for veggie sticks so that you don't consume any unnecessary starch filler."}
{"text":"This place absolutely had the chewiest hard wings I've ever eaten. It's criminal considering the outrageously high prices they charge not to mention my gf ordered a Pina colada with a double shot and it clearly wasn't although to her credit the bartender added another shot to make it up to her. 
Guess I'm still looking for a great wing place as this clearly isn't it. The atmosphere and place itself is nice if you don't care about the quality of the food though. 
Also in a side note don't bother with the blue cheese dip as it is tasteless !"}
{"text":"Best wings in town used to love bistro on avenue now this place rocks for suicide wings the coleslaw sucks but Cesar salad is good and fries to die for ..."}
{"text":"Poor service, I felt as if the managers could have help the servers and bartenders out just a little bit more.. Instead of just  awkwardly hovering around. The woman's washroom was covered in spiderwebs and potato bugs.. Ew. With all the hovering they do you would think that someone would find som time to hover over and take a look at the costumers washroom. The food was some what edible after the first beer and in classic bar fashion the food was way to salty.. God damn chains.."}
{"text":"Nope nope nope!!! Girl rushed us as soon as we sat down. We barely took a sip of water before she asked were we ready to order. We asked for a FEW minutes but she came back in about 30 seconds and was annoyed when we still weren't ready. Not to mention, the place was nearly empty so it wasn't like she had an abundance of tables!! 

We ordered wings, ribs and a burger. ALL were horrible! Wings were so small, one nibble and it was gone! Not to mention they were dry inside and the sauce was awful. Ribs were also tiny and tasted like they were a week old! Burger was cooked medium although we asked for well. Fries were cold, drinks were flat. 

Just a big NO! Never again."}
{"text":"My iced tea was fantastic, so I'll just state that now. On another note, someone else's diet Pepsi was flat as f**k. No bubbles. We asked for another and it was flatter than the first when we got it. Like, you can tell it's flat cuz there are no bubbles visible. 
Another note, it's been 35 mins and still no food. Plus we saw a waitresses bum, which to some may be a 5 star experience, but not for me and my boyfriends parents. Classy."}
{"text":"The most inefficient wait list system and the most inefficient staff at a fast paced environment/restaurant. 
They wait list people and tell them 1.5-2hr wait, and that they will call when table is ready. When I walked inside it was not even busy, many empty tables but not being seated, cleaned or was being cleaned very slowly. A lot of time being wasted on the phone calling ppl back and waiting for them (or only part of the party) to come back to the restaurant instead of seating people who are already there with the full party and was wait listed as well. Ppl come back after 1.5 hours and there is still at least another hour wait...ridiculous. And hostess is easily side tracked, and only took half my number down for the wait list and walked away and attended to other people.."}
{"text":"St Louis has very friendly staff. Their food is sub-par and quite pricey, although I absolutely love their club sandwich. I would recommend. They are great for football Sunday, but if you want to eat or drink during a Blue Jays game, you'll want to go early."}
{"text":"I'm an avid Wild Wings fan, and go there about once a week or two. But there is a promotion for AYCE Wings for $19.99 so I thought, 'Why not?'

I was surprised to see that the place is quite small and crammed, but my friend and I was seated at the only empty table inside. Despite being a moonday night, the place was getting more and more busy, even the patio outside was fully seated by the time we left! Not only that, but there were only about 3 servers! I was expecting to have very infrequent service, due to the many tables to tend to, but all the servers were really fast and on top of things! They didn't treat us any less and took the time to explain their entire promo, like how you have to purchase a drink with it and you get to choose 2 flavours. They would chck on us frequently and made sure to clear our empty plates and asked if we needed refills instead of us trying to track them down for refills. Service is 10/10. The server went so far as to even ask for our flavours for our next batch of wings before we finished. She told us she thought it would be best to order then rather than when we finished, since we would have to wait a long time for our wings with all the customers. Now that's customer service! And just like she said, the next batch came just as we finished. 

Although, I still prefer the wings at Wild Wings, their service could never come close to what I experienced here."}
{"text":"Called to place a take out order for wings and she said it would be ready in half an hour. We came to pick up the order about 35 minutes later and still had to wait another 10 minutes standing around just to pay and grab the food. The waitress clearly made eye contact 3 times and didn't even bother coming over but instead took the orders of 4 tables, and one of the tables had just sat down after we came in to pick up the order. I think it's reasonable to say that a paying customer comes first, especially once the food is ready to be given out. Not to mention, the girl didn't sound too friendly and just sounded like she had excuses after another when she finally came over to give us our food. Maybe suggest more staff during your lunch hour if you don't think you can handle it to your management..."}
{"text":"Decided to try this location with my family of 3 and my best friend and his family of 3.  The ambience of the place was a little too dark for my taste.  I've been at the Queensway location and it wasn't that dark.  Right off the bat I know this is place is for a hangout place.  
Got seated and noticed it was cold, maybe because.it was winter or maybe because Everytime smokers go outside the cold air enters in.  That's Alright except when you have kids with you it's a little too cold.  Maybe putting in another door before you actually enter the place will help them with their heating bill. 
Finally ordered and the wings were great.  I had the garlic parm which was a little strong when you keep eating them wings and I had another pound of Mississippi honey bbq.  That was awesome.  
Overall it was a great place for wings, but not when it's -15+ outside."}
{"text":"Nice bar, great big screen to watch the sporting events but small seating area. Conveniently located connected to Fairview Mall. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Been a fan of St.Louis Wings due to their Magic Garlic Dill Sauce for a while. Now it seems I live 100 light years away from any of their locations.. I make it a priority to stop by several times while in Town each time. After back to back visits during the all star game and again tonight I must say that the garlic dill sauce is not the only Magic Trick they have up their sleeve.
Tony and Sharina represent Custommer service at its finest. They make us feel like home .. Just with a few more flat screens :)))
Bramalea location is our absolute fav.. These guys deserve a raise !!! 
Ps. Has anybody ever bathed in garlic dill? .....We may be the first then... Just Love it!!!!! 
Counting days to be back soon!
Cheers

{"text":"Second time being here..

Kinda the worst experiences, waited over 20 mins for 3 meals. 2 with wing combos, shit portions for fries as well, and for mine of course the server got it wrong. Asked for pulled pork tacos and came with a sandwhich. Both my wife and my son got chicken and NO napkins were given or towelettes."}
{"text":"Fastest service I ever got at a St.Louis, and on a Tuesday too!
Hostess was courteous and offered us seating options, which I really appreciated, and the servers and waitresses were very nice. 
The food was on our table within 10 minutes of ordering and we were out in less than an hour. 

Ordered the Hot & Honey wings and my boyfriend got the Sweet and Spicy Sriracha. I expected Hot & Honey to taste like hot honey garlic, but it was more of a spicy and sweet BBQ flavour, so I asked for some honey garlic sauce on the side. The Sweet and Spicy Sriracha was really good. Both were 2 flames and I don't disagree. 

Definitely coming back to this location. I mean, Tuesday Wings and Movies? Heck yeah."}
{"text":"Do me a favour, never dine here! Horrible service and food. I got a hair (short and curly) the total opposite of mine. I notified the server and she looked at me as if I was joking, putting my own hair. (Seriously?). Anyways the burger was remade but no bill deduction. I came here months after to give it a second chance... no change. Service and food is disgusting. Unexplainable."}
{"text":"Note to the numskull running this location: at wonderland (directly across the street), there is a 2 hour transition period where hungry, thirsty people have nowhere to go between the wonderland day hours and night time Halloween haunt. 
We meandered over to St Louis thinking we'd have some apps, a few beers and dinner. But that would be too easy. The hostess was turning people away upon entry. I watched 40+ people leave because of an unclear reason given that they couldn't seat anyone at the many visible empty tables.  

We just sat at an empty table and walked to the (not busy yet overwhelmed and very slow) bar to get beers. I've never seen such a poorly run operation - who is the floor manager? Fire this person right now. My cider was served with ice. We sat here for 45 mins, watched clueless servers standing around checking their phones and listened to angry patrons wonder where their food was and what was happening. 
Joke! ' go somewhere else ' is the new unofficial slogan of St Louis. 
They later cited the 'wonderland rush' as the reason why it was so slow but we saw all of those people leave."}
{"text":"Uhm, called the number on this yelp to make a reservation and not only was it not answered by a human, the voice message said the mailbox was full!"}
{"text":"Half-price wing nights can not get better than st. louis... gigantic wings with a side of fries accompanied by their creamy dill dip for just 5.50$?!?!?!??!"}
{"text":"First off, I want to thank Ryan (manager) for his amazing customer service.
Ryan took my take out order and he was very nice and polite. One of most polite guy I ordered from at a restaurant.
I ordered the Double Trouble earlier today, and he told me that it would take about 15 minutes.
It took slightly longer than that, so he gave me extra chicken which was great.
I finally got back home, and opened the container only to realize that they forgot the fries. I was slightly annoyed (their fries are great!!!) so I decided to call them. Ryan picked up the phone and he was very apologetic and gave me extra wings telling me that he's doing it because I was very polite and patient (tbh, he was way nicer :P).
The cook also came to apologize for the mix up while I waited for the food.

The only reason why it's a 4 star instead of a 5 star was because the quality of the wing was very inconsistent. Some were dry and some were nice and juicy.
I got had the honey garlic, buffalo ranch, and the hot sweet asian for the sauce and I liked the honey garlic the most and the buffalo ranch the least."}
{"text":"Nice ambience for a sports bar on a weeknight. I like their half-price wings on Tuesdays. However, we were served burnt wings on one occassion. 

I do recommend it for people that live closer to Bramalea City Centre. Bang for your buck."}
{"text":"The waitress brought me the wrong order.  When i told her she took it away and didn't offer me anything complimentary and i sat and watched my friend eat  his meal. When they finally brought the right dish the chicken tasted like hockey pucks.  When the bill arrived they didn't even take off anything from the bill not even a drink to compensate for their mistake. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I should get a little worry or should I be really afraid?

A brand new St Louis Bar Bar & Grill just open up in the plaza right next to Moksha Yoga RH!!

This evening while practising on an empty stomach in a heated room, all I think about was an iced cold beer and hot like hell wings, and would the Leaf going to win tonight's game!

Service here was amazing. Friendly and polite.

The restaurant itself is small and cozy with enough TV so no matter wherr you sitting, you would have a good view.

A Lb of their Hot As Hell Wing and Perfect fries went so good with my Mill St Organic.

PS the manager opened the door and welcomed me in and the bartender really personal... made me feel right at home!

I will be back....anytime"}
{"text":"I am a little disappointed with St. Louis 's ribs...

The price on a Saturday night is not bad at all $14.99 of a whole rack of back ribs with fries and coleslaw. 

A whole rack? I usually cannot eat a whole rack by myself..but when my waitress served me this smallish ribs... with hardly any meat... I think I will need 2 of those in order to fill me up.. why am I feeling like I am a pig?

The rib though is a little dry.. The fries are like frozen variety from the supermarket...

At least I enjoy my half pint of Rolling Rock ($3.99)

FYI, you would need to order a beverage in order to take advantage of the specials.

Maybe I come back for the wings special on another day.... but I think have to pass on the ribs.

This St Louis' s location is a little smallish.. but they do have 4 different TVs all set on different sport games and even have UFC if it is your thing."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan. We came here on the weekend primarily because it could seat a large group with kids. The food was underwhelming, even for a chain restaurant.

The burger was spongy and gross. It was one of those industrially-processed frozen patties you get in a high school cafeteria. My wife's tacos were soggy, and macaroni and cheese was overcooked to the point of disintegration.

I know, what do I expect at a place like this, but many, many chain restaurants have better food, up to and including McDonald's. The burger at 5 Guys is cheaper and blows this place out of the water.

The fries were crispy and pretty good, and the service was friendly. However, I would not come again just given the low food quality."}
{"text":"I came on a Friday night to satisfy a wing craving. They have a deal where you get 1lb of wings and 1lb of boneless for $23.99. We picked Honey Garlic and Garlic Parm. Honey Garlic could've used a little more pizzazz, but you can never go wrong with Garlic Parm! The deal also came with nice, thick cut fries with that differentiated themselves from the competition. My boyfriend got the Chicken and Waffles, and although it seemed the little underwhelming, the dressing on the waffle was a nice surprise of sweet and sour. I was a bit skeptical to come here at first since I never heard raving reviews, but after this experience I'll definitely come back for more (Half priced wing night maybe?!)."}
{"text":"Ordered lobster tacos, fries, wings, beer, Margarita.. Everything was great. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Music was nice too. The patio was open so that's always great. Place was clean. Service was fairly quick too. I'm pretty sure the  lobster tacos was new in the menu.. I hope they keep it because they were tasty. Wings were not too greasy. Fries weren't greasy either. I wish I could have stayed longer and ordered more wing. They had a special- pound of wings and pint of beer. Parking was free, and close to the restaurant. Location I find is easy to get to. I'll be back there for sure and I'd recommend this location."}
{"text":"I used to work at the Best Buy across the street, so I have been to this location many times. The one thing I can appreciate is the consistency in taste and service. I recently went back and the experience has not changed.

Our waiter was great and routinely checked on us to see if we needed anything. It was thoughtful since we were there for a few hours with a big group. The food came out timely and tasted great. 

This is definitely one of the better locations that I've been to. I definitely prefer this one over the ones at Fairview and York Mills."}
{"text":"Me and my friends used to visit the pub frequently because of the close distance and every time told to myself not to come back again.
The food not bad, but the owner of the pub is complete jerk.
He has no clue what a good customer service means.
A few times  a couple of unexpected friends wanted to join our full table, so  we asked for a couple of chairs to add to the table,or just  to move to bigger table, but the owner refused. He did have a bigger tables that weren't reserved, also free chairs, but  for some reason, he didn't want to do it for us, mentioned , that we are troublemakers ??? 
We always order wings, calamari, beer, appetizers and deserts. Every bill we pay is at least  $35-$40 per person, so
he should be happy to have more customers, but he is not....
Last time the bill had an additional charge of $5 per person for the UFC event. I asked to remove it, cause nobody told us in advance about that charge. Owner agreed to remove it only if we are not coming back to his pub anymore....

Until the owner will be changed, wouldn't go there even if i get paid for the visit.

St. Louis Bar & Grill at Dufferin & Finch - NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"So it's Tuesday. Half price wing night after 4pm I believe. If you're coming here with the expectation that this is anymore than the synonymous of an Orc devouring an elk, you need some cold water on your face.

Security at front door takes your name down and you're called when your table is up. Between 6-9pm, anymore than 2 or 3 people you should expect at least a 30 min wait. Service was fine, considering the amount of people.

So the food. Wings were cooked fine. A little heavy on the sauce this time, but quite the contrary the last time I came here. Seems hard for the kitchen staff to find the centre. It should go without saying that this conclusion led to some very salty wings and a daily sodium intake even far superior to the Orcs.

Overall, 2.5 stars rounded to 3."}
{"text":"I just came home from st louis and I am dying to write a review!

Today its tuesday which is their famous wing night! with a drink, u can get 9 pieces of wing for $6.95 or 18 piece for $13.95 which is quite a deal. They usually have different deals each day so its good that  you check it out! 

Overall, I like their environment and service... their wings are great too! 
give it a try when u stop by!! =)"}
{"text":"Just wanna say big thanks to Vanessa I was with my 2 kids and wife and she was very helpful and recommending food along. The wings was off the hook we finished our meal with lava cake desert awesome.
Will be in the gym rest off the week :)"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place for wings in Toronto! . Love the selection of sauces offered and the garlic dip for wings awesome! .Service was great our server courtney was super friendly and very helpful answering questions!  Came from London ontario to have wings! .Really miss having a location in london! ."}
{"text":"I love coming to St Louis! Their wings are some of the best in town and the waitresses are always so nice! Half price wing night on Tuesday and half price starters on Thursday, eat All the wings!!"}
{"text":"This was our first and last time here.

We had to constantly flag down our waitress to get ANYTHING -- it was like we were an afterthought. 

The portions were small, over priced, and under seasoned. 

I was absolutely flabbergasted that my \"1/2 rack of baby back ribs\" consisted of five dried out barely 3\" long bones.  When I questioned the waitress about the portion, she sent the Manager to our table. He insisted that I was given  \"a half rack\". Really? Maybe HALF of a half rack, but NOT a real half rack.

Accompanied by frozen fries and a mini-cup of mayonnaise-y slaw -- not a good deal for $18.

My eating partner was similarly unimpressed with his wings & salad.

Skip this place."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is not a bad restaurant. The food was predictable, but I knew it when I walked in. We ordered 2 drinks, a large house salad & 2 lbs of wings. We ordered the authentic Buffalo and the Caribbean jerks flavors for the wings. The Buffalo wings were indeed authentic plus saucey. The jerky wings were oh so hot. We enjoyed them while we were suffering. :-) 
The restaurant was packed throughout from dinner time to 9pm. This is a popular spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I come here often just on Tuesdays for half price wings.  Its the best deal because of the fries personally.  They are realllly good with the dip, and taste good with the wings.  I like the garlic parm.  My husband and friend always gets \"sweet hot asian\", \"hotter than hell\", or regular \"honey garlic\". The waitresses are nice.  Some great, and one in particular (I think she is new) tries wayyyy too hard.  We are regulars, knew exactly what we wanted, but she continued talking bla bla bla.  There are other wing places WAY tastier, but this is just a good deal for us, on Tuesdays of course, and since its close to home.  So when I don't feel like cooking on a Tuesday, we go to St. Louis."}
{"text":"Tuesday night my friend and I were STARVING for some cheap food.
He told me St. Louis is really good in his area - Vaughn for good wings/ribs! And that they always have great deals.

It just so happend that it was Wing night on tuesday so it was 9 wings for 7$ with fries or 18 wings for 13$ with fries.
We of course ordered 2, 18 wings with fries and piggedd out!

IT WAS DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Just typing this now makes me want to go there again and order more wings.
Mmmmmmmm..

SPECIALS EVERY DAY!!
Monday - Wing & Pitcher 
Tuesday - Wing Night
Wednesday - Chicken night
Thurs - Half Price Appetizers
Fri - Wing & Rib Combo

Dont go for the service or atmosphere.
*its like a sports bar*
GO FOR THE FOOD!
Amazing prices and very tastey!

I also heard there is an outdoor patio in the back. :)"}
{"text":"Very good bar to hang out. Specially on Thursday, which the appetizers are half price. The poutine is also very good and the boneless wings are amazing. My favourite sauce is garlic parmesan."}
{"text":"I love St. Louis Bar and Grill! I usually get the Sweet Asian BBQ boneless wings and fries because they are very good! St. Louis' fries are the best fries I've had at a restaurant and the dip it comes with is also amazing. 

The location is right by STC and the YMCA. To be honest I don't know where the parking is for this location but there is no problem with parking at STC and walking over, it's about a 2-3 minute walk. 

The wait staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and service is good. The restaurant is small but there are indoor and outdoor seating. I've been to this location a number of times and to other locations as well, with no huge complaints.

I will come here just for the fries!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night to get something to eat before we went to go watch a movie. My past few experiences here have been amazing but the last visit was okay, but not amazing like the last few times.

My boyfriend and I weren't that hungry so we decided to go for the \"daily deal.\" It was triple play Saturday, so we were allowed to get one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert for $20.99 plus tax. We decided to go for the bruschetta flatbread, suicide wings w/ fries & the deep fried cheesecake. The bruschetta flatbread was okay, not the best.. I feel like there wasn't much toppings (felt like I was eating plain flatbread half the time). The wings w/ fries were good.. wings were spicy as hell but good! Fries w/ the sauce is always amazing here. The deep fried cheesecake was good EXCEPT for the amount of strawberry syrup they put on it. If they put a bit less it would have been way better.

The service is good, not amazing, but not bad. Our waitress checked up on us here and there, but it was hard to get a hold of her at times."}
{"text":"Came here one evening while staying at the Chelsea Hotel. This is probably the smallest St. Louis I have been too. Upon arrival, we got seated quickly. The restaurant wasn't busy, but some tables were taken. 

The calamari, ribs and fries were delicious! The amount they gave us was pretty good too, we had left overs, and took them back to the hotel. 

The service was okay. To be honest, not the best. Even though the restaurant was not packed/super busy, our waitress hardly checked up on us. We always had to get her attention if we needed something.

3 stars because the food was amazing, and we got a seat right away."}
{"text":"Came here twice, first experience was okay, second experience was horrible. 

The first time I decided to go here, the wait time was pretty bad, however my boyfriend and I wanted to eat here so decided to kill time in the mall until they called us. We got called 30 minutes later. The food was good, however the service was horrible. The waiter always took forever to approach us, and made it seem like it was so busy, when it really wasn't. We didn't care as much, because the food was good.

However, during our second visit.. I would say their wait time is horrible, and they should really do something about it. Considering I'm not the only one who thinks it after reading the reviews for this place. We put our names down on the wait list, and got called an hour and 50 minutes later, when the host told us the wait was an hour. 

The food was okay at this location, however the fries felt like it was soggy or something which was gross. Wings and dessert were pretty good. However, the service was horrible, especially the wait time. Would go back to St. Louis, but def not to this location."}
{"text":"My second visit at this location. Came in for launch and did I ever feel unwelcome. 

On my first visit, the service was okay and the food was below average at best. On this visit, they really nailed it good! Bad service & awful food! Mind you, I'm a pretty easy going and reasonable person. I'd be pretty happy at least one out of the two was good (service or food). Yep, that is the end of this St. Louis for me.

First Visit: 
Service: 3/5
Food: 1/5 (Dry & change the OIL!)

Second Visit:
Service: 0/5
Food: 1/5 (Dry & change the OIL!)

Overall Rating: 0.5/5"}
{"text":"Nothing exciting like wild wing . Small wings and not much meat . Lots of tv's to watch games . Some of the wings barley had sauce on them ."}
{"text":"On the plus side ... half price wings Tuesdays!  *with purchase of a large drink

I've been here several times since I am always in the area.  Service and food is ok, I personally would not travel out of the way unless it was to catch their special.  Take out is \"20 minutes\" but closer to 30.  Super packed on game days, not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Granted St. Louis is a chain, but this is a great place for wings in the area. My co-workers and I visited this location on many occasions and service is great when it's not busy. I'm amazed at how the waitresses can remember 7+ food and drink orders! There's nothing particularly special about the food -- it tastes like other St. Louis restaurants. I find the carbonated drinks a little flat.

I recall on one occasion when the power went out on the block as well as all the power in the restaurant. We received our food, so we weren't affected. The owner came around and gave everyone a voucher for a free lunch on the next visit. Now that's great customer service!"}
{"text":"I can now check off wing-eating contest from my to do list.

I came here tonight for a work social event. They were unable to accommodate us for Tuesday half-priced wings, so instead they booked us for Monday and extended the half-price discount. They also mixed together a special sauce that's hotter than their hottest sauce for those brave enough to try it.

Their wings are kind of small, as mentioned by others. Their hot sauce was indeed hot, but also too vinegary for my taste. The service here is quick and attentive. Normally I'd give this place 3 stars, but they get an extra +1 for being accommodating to a group of 30-40 people."}
{"text":"Came here for the raptors playoff game yesterday against Washington. Due to the freezing rain and weather warnings, the place wasn't as packed as it should be. Regerdless, we were still greeted with excellent service. However, the food was a tad bit on the disappointing side.
We ordered their 3$ daily soups (tomato bisque & cream of mushroom) and it wasn't bad.. but it was cold as an ex-girlfriend's heart!! You could clearly tell that the soups come frozen, but at least have the decency to warm it up properly.
Their calamari was decent, the nachos were just meh. The wings were not sauced properly, we had to order extra sauce on the side. The only thing that was good was the 23oz pints of beer they offer for 5.99$ on game nights.
Overall, it's a good place to come and watch the game with some friends but as a place that's solely for dinner... you're better off going somewhere else.
Solid 3/5. Will return for games but I'll probably eat a bit at home first."}
{"text":"Meh. I've experienced better. Yes... much bettttter indeed. 
St. Louis is known for their half priced wings on Tuesdays and other great deals everyday. Cheap and not bad wings. They're more of a skinny type of wings though. Not very meaty! Service is terrible on Tuesdays and I believe they change their oil on Wednesdays because the wings often come out burnt and fries come out dark brown. This is much better than their Yonge and Finch location though so If you're nearby go to this one! 
Just remember not to glance through the window into the kitchen as you'll lose your appetite due to the conditions of the kitchen and its tidiness! 
Only good thing about them is they're open late so if you're hungry and want munchies.. its them vs. Mcdonalds and in my book, they win EVERYTIME! 
Also their chippers are AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago a friend and I decided to take a walk down yonge and stop at the first place that seemed to be happening. We decided on st Louis bar and grill to dine for the evening. It was a beautiful day so we were fortunate to be able to get a patio seat. We enjoyed the lovely world cup atmosphere as well with many tv's placed inside and outside the bar. 

My friend decided to order the special of the day which was an appetizer, main and dessert all for a special price. I decided to order the same thing I ordered in the past at another st Louis. The appetizer was \"bacon wrapped mac and cheese\" we were super excited because really how can you go wrong with anything bacon :). They were amazing and I know next time I go there these little guys will be on my list. 

As for my main I was disappointed. I order the chicken club. The last place I went to did it so well which is why I was excited to enjoy it again. This time around it was even close to what I had enjoyed in the past. For desert my friend ordered the Lindt chocolate ice cream cake.. it was amazing! So tasty and full of richness. 

The service of the place seemed average along with the atmosphere. Nothing really blew me away with service but being such a busy location I guess they don't really have to. They are surround by tons and tons of condo and hundreds of residences. 

All in all I will return being so close to home.. its a good location to unwind after a busy workday or for a get together on the weekend."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service. Our server was very nice & the food was excellent. Will be back!"}
{"text":"St. Louis has daily specials and I decided to come here with one of my girlfriends on a Thursday night: half price apps. The dining area is quite clean and we got a booth near the back which is near the patio doors. It can get a little drafty so bundle up a bit. There's a few apps you can choose from but we decided with pulled pork poutine, nachos, and calamari. 

The food was good but nothing too special. My favourite of the 3 was probably the pulled pork poutine - the pork was good. We just love having different options to pick from. Splitting the bill was easy and was an affordable dinner. I would come back to try the other things! 

Service was a tad slow and we've asked a few times for water and was forgotten."}
{"text":"This location rocks. Staff very friendly. Food is standard like any St Louis Bar. I always get the bacon cheddar burger and they always deliver a great burger. A little pricey but the burger is awesome!"}
{"text":"In terms of casual restaurants, this is one of my favourites.  I have been eating here for years (and before that the Bistro on Avenue and Lawrence) and I don't think I've ever looked at the menu.  I've never had to because I've only ever ordered the wings.

The wings are the best in the city in my opinion, and on top of that the dipping sauce just makes it that much better.

Always a great experience there, never a disappointment (granted I'm only ever going there for the same thing...).  I keep thinking that one of these days I'll actually try something other than the wings, but I probably won't."}
{"text":"This update is long overdue. Since I initially posted this review, I've gone back...and I'm ashamed to admit this...1-2 times a week in the past two months. 

Okay, okay - I know, complete and total insanity, but there's a reason: my boyfriend started the keto diet back in February and apparently chicken wings are totally acceptable keto fare.

With that in mind, when he first suggested we go back to this location, I was staunchly opposed. With some debate, I finally threw my hands up in the air and relented - at least I knew what to expect if they failed.

That's when Alexis happened. Now, I shouldn't say this as if this was the first time we've crossed paths with her - we've had Alexis take care of us before, she's always a ray of sunshine, positive, bubbly, welcoming and thoughtful. She's the one who's always recalled our order perfectly and taken such great care of us.

But she *is* the reason we've decided to continue our patronage to this location. I've pushed the prior experience to the depths of my mind and have decided to let it go as an off night for the waitress. 

Alexis is truly the best thing to happen to this location and we've continuously left her generous tips since to express our thanks for her consistent thoughtfulness, and warm demeanour. She is someone who you can truly tell genuinely loves her job, the people she works with and the customers. She always asks about things you've shared with her on previous visits - be it my boyfriend's keto diet, or DIY projects. 

We are continuously touched by the extra length she always goes to in an effort to make sure we're well taken care of. Thanks so much, Alexis!"}
{"text":"Top notch service in the middle of a weekend during the day.  Food was great, service was quick, and exceptionally good.  Thank you Julia!"}
{"text":"Busy on Sundays sometimes; place gets packed when there's a game on. $4.50 for bar rail shots and half-price appetizers On Thursday is definetely something to come back for."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday with a few friends. We all ordered wings and shared a bucket of onion rings. To be honest, I didn't find a difference between the half pound and one pound of wings other than getting fries (so were we getting ripped off or?), so that was disappointing. Food took longer than I expected to get out, but that was okay. Service was generally friendly."}
{"text":"Came here to watch the raptors!  Lucky i landed on cheap burger day!  pretty standard here.  Although some st.louis wings sometimes are over fried where there are hard rock like bits.

I hate it when its over dry from frying and u get those chunks of dry rock like meat.
those that frequent st.louis may know.

Otherwise, if you get a good batch.. its all good.  Their fries are pretty bomb once in a while too."}
{"text":"Convenient location, cozy sized restaurant, it gets really busy in the evening when there is a game on and you end up having to wait for a table but that's the case in most bars during a game. Make sure to call in and reserve a table ahead of time to avoid the wait time. The food is okay (I've had better wings and fries cooked at other St. Louis locations), and the wait staff service could be better."}
{"text":"I've been to a St. Louis bar before and I had a better experience than this.

We entered this restaurant and we were waiting a little bit to get seated which made me question if we should just seat ourselves but a waiter finally came and seated us. It took us a while to actually get a waiter to take our orders. We got Sheyla, who was a pretty bad waitress. She asked for our drinks and told us the menu specials. One of us got ginger ale and three of us got water with lemon. When we finally got our drinks, only the ginger ale had ice and our waters didn't even have ice or our lemons so I requested lemons. Then while she putting the tray down to take our orders, she dropped it on me! It was only a mistake but I feel as it shouldn't of happened. Anyways we waited a long time for our food and it was really late so there weren't many people in the restaurant. We finally see our food (we all ordered wings and fries) and only three people have received their food so I had to wait a bit longer. The food was so good!!! I really love the dill sauce! I would definitely come back for the food. I finished my drink before I had received my
food and I was expecting her to at least come around and ask if I needed a refill but she never offered any of us one. When she delivered our food I asked for one and she actually brought me a pitcher of water. I've never had that happen to me before a restaurant so it was a bit annoying because I prefer for the waiter to do their job and refill my glass. While I was eating my food I seen a big moth fly around, which was gross. The service was bad but it was tolerable and while I don't think she deserved a tip, we left one. 

I would come back here and I recommend this restaurant to other people but I would say be prepared to wait a long time for your food.

edit: Also I'd like to say that 4 people ordering wings shouldn't be like $60. Also a $7 tax??! 9 wings and like 15 french fries for $15??!! That's pretty expensive!"}
{"text":"Best wings in the Yonge and Finch area. Good service. Good place to watch a Hockey game. 

The only big draw back is that you may have to way for a table on a busy night. 

If the bottom is full, you can try going upstairs too. The menu is the same as downstairs."}
{"text":"Meh... there's a reason why I stay away from these chain wing places and this experience was just another reminder of that. 

Came in for the $16.99 \"ayce\" boneless chicken and of course, you have to buy a large drink with it. Just like the other garbage chain, on Tuesdays it's really not \"half off wings\" and I don't know how they get away with these false promotions. If you go to their Facebook there's no mention of any large drink purchase, yet when we sat down and looked at the menu, in the tiniest writing, is \"with a purchase of a large drink.\" Strike one. 

Fine. We'll order a drink. We order our flavors. The first round was decent. The chicken was small but good to sample other flavours. I actually really liked their fries here. Very crispy and tasted great. It's TOO BAD THEY DON'T COME WITH ANY OTHER ORDERS AFTER IT. When you order your \"second\" flavor, there are no fries or white sauce with it after your first round. K. The second round with the dry rub was the most overdone chicken I've ever had. It's crazy. Crazy bad. I stopped because everything I had was unappetizing and I felt very ripped off at this experience. Strike 2. 

Service was lol. There were only two waitresses, one being completely new and so she had a lot of learning to do, and the other being the manager I guess. They really should have had another one as both our table and another table had lots of troubles flagging down someone. This is also a small restaurant btw. It sucks cause the manager was working hard but seems like she doesn't enjoy her job at all. Both of them weren't very aware and kept their head down, completely missing our asks. We ordered alcoholic drinks and it didn't come for half an hour. The bartender was doing jack and finally the manager said she \"reminded the bartender about our drinks.\" O k t h e n. Strike 3. 

I am staying far, far away from chain wing places from now on. Goodbye."}
{"text":"One of the newer locations.  Definitely try their wings, poutine and sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Chicken wings here are delicious. Food is usually always good and consistent. However, there never seems to be enough waitresses around to deal with all the customers, and there is often a long wait to get your food and your drinks refilled. 

However, the Tuesday chicken wing special is really cheap, and the fries are delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome wings! Service is great too! Half price Tuesday wings and half price appetizer Thursdays."}
{"text":"A fast and satisfying meal.  

We went on Saturday night and the restaurant was surprisingly quiet. The waitress was very energetic (in a good way) and service was prompt--we were in and out in under an hour. We shared ribs and wings. They were delicious, if albeit, slightly average. 

My wife and I spit the Saturday night rib deal ($16 for a full rack of ribs w/fries & coleslaw and a  pound of wings (around $11). We weren't stuffed, but we were full. Overall a decent value for a solid meal. 

I'm not a fan of \"family restaurants\", but in comparison to Boston Pizza, Applebee's, Chili's, etc. I would rank St.Louis at the top of the heap. The next time I'm craving ribs or wings, this is the place I'll be heading."}
{"text":"Have often gone in here before a Blue Jays game, which is when it is often extremely crowded and typically has a line to get in.

Have only ever sat at the bar, so don't know what the table service is like, but the bartenders have always been friendly and attentive without being too pushy. Often they've told me about beer deals they have which saved me money.

The food is typical pub food, but I've always loved the ancho chipotle club wrap. And the fries are excellent. Fluffy and spiced perfectly, not some bland, cheap tasting frozen junk."}
{"text":"Food was consistent to other locations but the beer tasted weird. I felt that the tap was not clean. But the main reason for 3 stars only was that on a holiday Monday evening they only had 1 waitress who was going crazy attending the bar and guests and off course therefore, service was SO SLOW! We only had wings and beer but it took forever to get the food and the bill! I even had to go up to the only waitress to order or ask for other items. This kinda ruined the experience...."}
{"text":"I would give this place 10 stars if I could. I have ALWAYS had a great time here and the waitresses have consistently been amazing! I love their garlic sauce and they always always always give it extra if I ask for it. But the location at finch and duffrine (sp?) is so bad that they charge for each tiny dip you ask for! Hence I NEVER go there anymore. 
Recently I have switched my lifestyle and the way I eat. I went to St Louise (the one I am reviewing) and reluctantly ask the waitress if she could accommodate my request. She not only accommodated my request she even suggested some ideas within my guidelines!!! I loved the experience! Then I went back again yesterday the same waitress attended to us. When I started telling her what I could and couldn't eat (thinking she must have forgotten me from the last time) she right away remembered me AND my requirements!!!! She was just awesome! 

All in all I LOVE this location and their business practices. Good service, good food, good people. Will continue to go back there - ALWAYS!"}
{"text":"The attitude of the waitresses and services says it all.  I tipped her out of pitty, but this place doesn't deserve even 1 star.

Counting down the days this place goes out of business and keeping my fingers crossed because it would be better for the community if they just got bought out by a high end chain."}
{"text":"Solid little bar in Markham. (Highway 7 just west of warden Ave). By little I mean literally. This place is friggin tiny! 

I've pre booked tables for events such as super bowl and they've been great. The food isn't the most healthiest, obviously, but everything always comes out fresh. You can tell it was just made for you. 

They have some pretty solid deals going on usually too. The fries and chicken wings are pretty good. 

Overall it's your typical small bar. The fellow reviews of the Waitress's hold true, they are very friendly and attentive. 

Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This spot is cool. Great place to grab half off wings on Tuesday, drink beer, and watch the game. They have plenty of tv's so you can see from anywhere. They have lots of wing flavors and the fries are like potato wedges. Everything was cool"}
{"text":"Just the worst.  Walked in sober.  Told that we SMELLED like we were drunk. Ordered food. Billed THREE TIMES while we were eating. Asked for the manager. HE WAS HAMMERED. paid and left. Never again"}
{"text":"The good: friendly service. Near the beach. Mixed drinks were well made and beer was cold.  
The bad:  the washrooms reeks of month old piss.  Like amazingly bad. Fish tacos were embarrassing. Think overcooked high-liner overcooked from frozen. Hilariously bad. Salad was wilted and sad.  

Pass for life."}
{"text":"Came to St. Louis' to watch the Jays Game 6. Made reservations ahead of time for two. Walked into the restaurant and the waitress by the door seemed annoyed already. She spent the entire time looking at a clipboard instead of talking to the people who walks in. Had to go up to her to tell her here for 8pm reservation. Got seated in a corner table.

The waitress who took the drinks forgot about the order until she passed by, looked at the empty table and remembered. Ordered 2lbs of wings, half dry rub lemon pepper and the other wet sauce garlic parm. The food took more than 30 minutes because the kitchen was backed up. Recommend not substituting the side for something else, St. Louis' has some pretty awesome fries as a side. The wings were both really well done, the flavours were as expected from the name. One negative comment would be some of the drumsticks might have been a little overdone because the meat felt kind of tough and dry.

Overall, will come back for the wings but probably not when they're busy. Definitely not well prepared enough for a full house."}
{"text":"Service on Monday lunchtime was super slow. We had to ask the waitress twice where our food order was.  When it did finally arrive the pulled pork sandwich was tasty and a reasonable size for a lunch menu.  The accompanying fries were very nice. Just a pity it all didn't come quicker."}
{"text":"Great location, although hard to see the sign from the road. solid wait staff, food on par with the rest of the chain."}
{"text":"I'm not a big St. Louis fan.  Minus the original location that is...but this one is pretty good.

They have the right mix of people and a cook that doesn't burn the crap out of the wings nor over fries the chips.  

The first part is hard to do - getting good service people to work and stay is always an issue with places like this but they did ok.  

The second part should be elementary right?  Take food, drop into deep fryer...check time.  Take out...tada!  Not so my friends, I think many a McD Fry Guy will tell you it takes a PhD to do this....Ugh!

Anyway, this location is hopping on WingNight-Tuesdays.  Beer deals are good.  Lots of TV's.  Great place to watch a game and add to the spare tire.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"A pretty small bar with a family restaurant feel. The food was good, but I could do without the kids yelling. That isn't why this is 3 stars. The dining experience was neither extremely bad or super good. Service was okay; which is to say it was GOOD considering this is a bar. The most memorable part of being here was the food. They make a spankin' good veggie burger. Subbed fries for yam fries for $1.99."}
{"text":"so far as wing places go, this place is pretty good, a fair bit of t.v.'s to watch whatever is happening in the line of sports. 
a really good selection of wings, fantastic service, and a great spot in the downtown core. recently went here for the first time, and I will defiantly be back. 
the waitress was absolutely fantastic from the start of the experience all the way until the end. my friend and I never even hit the bottom of our drinks the whole evening, which is a service that is completely rare in this day and age. she seemed to have a passion for working at this location, also rare in this day and age. she also sat with us after the meal to take some time to get to know us, which I thought was a very good trait on her part, I really wish I remembered her name cause she was on top of her game that evening. funny enough she exhibited the same traits with other diners as well, I wanted to write this down because the service was consistent that I could tell, whether it was a bunch of guys, a date night, or a family coming in. kudos to her and the standard that she sets for this company. 
Again, if I'm in the area I will defiantly be back because of the experience she provided. 
parking is street and underground options available. lots of transit options as well from this location."}
{"text":"3.5 star for drinks  and food  , 3 star for the service
This location of St Louis is next to Rogers Centre. We ordered the Shock Top Canadian beer and a special chicken poutine that was being served as a winter Olympics favourite.Both were very nice and went very well together.Check out the pics. However the service was not the very best I felt. We cpuld have been greeted with a little more warmth. Anyways was fun."}
{"text":"Location:

 It's located in a small strip with a McDonald's, a noodle place and a couple of other businesses.

Parking:
There's a rather large free parking lot (thanks suburbs) but it was pretty full when I go there.

The inside:
When I got in I was surprised. The place is a lot smaller than I thought it would be and was about half full. The bar area was packed with folks in their 20s. Theres a blue light, a big tv and people it is bar stool seating. We were sitting in the other half of the restaurant with regular tables. Its odd but the place has two completely different vibes. We were in a lower area that felt like a family place.

Seating in the place consists of bar stools, booths and 2 and 4 person tables. Its a bit crowded because they try and shove S many tables in the area as possible.

Food:
I order the. Chicken and waffles. It's served with sweet potato fries. The chicken and waffles were delicious. When it was brought to the table it looked so good. Huge portions. Potatoes fries were shared with the table. The waffles were soft in the middle but held up to the sauce and chicken.

The chicken was chicken tenders not pieces which I loved because the one thing I hate about chicken and waffles is having to deal with the bones.

My friend got the wings and fried. She said they were good. She's come back. The were not the best she had but we're the best in the neighbourhood.

The last person I our party got the 4 play platter which consisted of. 4 back ribs, 4 wings, 4 pcs. boneless and fries.

He liked it. I thought it looked a little disappointing on the plate.

Service:
Service was good. She was half dressed which is something I hate in an establishment. I hate when the waitresses are almost naked but the dudes are weather appropriate. Why are women required to dress like there's the possibility they are on the menu too?

{"text":"Love Wednesdays at St. Louis! Nothing like a nice juicy burger and perfect French fries to complete your day.

We have contemplated making this our weekly rituals and at $5.50 with drink purchase you can't really go wrong. It's a neighborhood franchise bar and grill, so don't expect much. But the service is always really good and so is the food. So never a complaint here."}
{"text":"St. Louis is a chain of the perfectly fake \"sports bars\". Fake because it is easier to find there a kid with his first date, than an actual drunken and yelling baseball fan.

Food is absolutely bar-style, no surprises here, but in general (I can speak for two locations I've been to) it is clean and well prepared. It is difficult to fail cooking a hamburger, yet so many people manage to do that... Well, St. Louis kitchen is up to the challenge.

This particular location is very good for meeting people (I usually chat with my landlord there). Grab a beer, get a hamburger, watch some bodies moving on the screens while waiting - and no worries about a drunk fight, that shouldn't happen in St. Louis."}
{"text":"The two stars are for the ambiance... Absolutely STELLAR place to watch a sporting event... however the service has always been slow and the food isn't anything to write home about... we went back week after week to watch football hoping it would get better, but it just didn't...."}
{"text":"Came here for the Tuesday's special half off wings with some friends. It was really busy as it usually is on this day. We each ordered 2 pounds of wings, and a cocktail drink. 

The service wasn't that great as it took almost 45 mins for us to get our food and 15 mins for them to get us our bill after asking for it. It is a busier time for them so we understood why service was slower. However, the patio on a nice day is great. You get what you pay for! Was worth it though."}
{"text":"A local wing spot that's perfect for watching sports. (Tons of TVs) The bacon wrapped mac and cheese is amazing. Decent fries too."}
{"text":"Has a great summer patio for sure, great for people watching and getting some vitamin D. The food I would not recommend, in fact I can't remember the last time I ate there. Its a few beers and stumble home kinda place so make sure you eat before.

 If you do decide to eat there remember it BYOD (Bring Your Own Defibrillator) Even the water is greasy and high in cholesterol, still don''t understand why a place like this that is flanked by fresh produce stores can't invest and offer fresh cut fries. 

Most of the staff are really friendly, however there are a select few that make your in laws seem like birthday clowns.

So over all I give the summer patio a solid 8 and the food a -3.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Good wings! Great service, lively atmosphere and open late on weekdays. Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been to a few other St. Louis around Toronto. This is by far the most spacious and most inviting. Compared to the other locations I have been to the service is also quite good here. The food is the same as the rest of the other franchises, which means if you want a decent pound of wings and a beer you can definitely get it here."}
