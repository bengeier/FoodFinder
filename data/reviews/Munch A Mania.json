{"text":"Good sandwhich, great customer service. Here on vacation & i like off the beaten path places. Owner took our order with a smile & entertained our kids as well, super nice people. I had a pastrami & wife had a 62 (turkey, bacon with sprouts & avacado on a roll). Both very pleases with the food & very happy with service & owners. Busy place for being small so i knew i chose right. They do breakfast as well i guess"}
{"text":"Munch a mania is down the street from my office so I often grab a salad, sandwich, soup or daily special for lunch once a week. The food is always good, fresh and affordable. And Gordon can always put a smile on my face!"}
{"text":"Munch-A-Mania is marvelous!  First time visit and got The Truth based on several reviews.  I didn't even ask what was on it and joked with the owner that he didn't suggest otherwise.  Wow!  What a delicious sandwich!  I'm not sure how I've worked reasonably close to this place for 18 years yet never knew about it.  Thank you Yelp and smart phones!  If you're reading this review...STOP...and just head over to Munch-A-Mania!"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is fantastic!  The food is always fresh and tastes delicious. My favorite thing about coming in is the warm greeting by the owners. They are always friendly and stop by to make sure we are satisfied with our meal. The brownies are also amazing you should try one!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I looked this place on Yelp for a good breakfast before a long trip to Tucson and we were totally impressed!  This is a simple deli-like restaurant with about 10 tables.  Portions are generous and the coffee great.  The burrito supreme for breakfast will fill the hungriest of breakfast goers and is enough for two!  We enjoyed end it so much we decided to get two sandwiches for the road.  Gordon was kind enough to give us some ice to keep them.  This place is a must for A-one customer service which is sorely lacking today!"}
{"text":"What a gem. Gordon and Mary are super friendly and the breakfast was well prepared. Nothing fancy but very good."}
{"text":"Everything is awesome and fresh. They are super fast, and friendly! Salads are massive, I have them for 2 meals, Turkey Bacon Sprouts with AVO, and favorite breakfast is the Egg Croissanwich Supreme. I'm so glad I work close by:)"}
{"text":"The owners are amazing and if you become a regular they will quickly remember you. They make everything fresh and it is truly evident in the taste. I love their chicken salad, so yummy!  Definitely take the time to try their specials of the day. A lot of my co-workers love them. I tend to stick to the same thing since I'm gluten free and my options are limited.  I would definitely suggest this place for breakfast or lunch. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing subs and sandwiches! Owners are great. Gordon is a hoot. Incredible prices. You get three times meat than Subway or some other big chain. I've had the toasted Turkey sub and the Truth (not on menu). Both were delish. The Truth was the best sandwich I've ever had. And it's so big I gave half to a co-worker. They get really busy right at noon so go earlier or later to avoid the rush because line is out the door. They also gave styrofoam cups which I love (even though I know they are bad for environment). Recently remodeled so like is nice inside. I want to try their breakfast too! I hear it's awesome. So glad I found this gem for lunch."}
{"text":"My first trip to Munch A Mania was a great one.  The owners were super friendly and polite, and I was surprised that there were quite a few people in the store, considering it's in a strip mall.  My bagel with cream cheese, bacon and tomato was a delicious combination that I never would have thought of myself.  The bagel sandwich and a 16oz soda was less than $5... cheaper than McDonald's or Chompie's for sure.  (Also, they have Barq's Red Cream Soda!)  Because it's on the north side of University Drive, it's easy to stop by if you're one of the many people who commute to ASU/Downtown Tempe from the 101.  Quick service, delicious food, and friendly people."}
{"text":"Plus column:  great chow, low prices, great service, good vibe, good parking.   Minus column:  nada  this place is solid all around.   a cheers-like attitude (extremely personable and genuine).  clearly a hit with the college athlete crowd. they need about 10 more of these around maricopa county.  hearty comfort food at a great price.   try it, you'll probably like it."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite sandwich shop in Tempe. From the second you walk in , you feel very at home- like you are in mom&pops kitchen. My boyfriend and I have started making Munchamania a weekly tradition and always loving everything we try! We have turned many of our friends and family on to this place and they have loved it as well.   Aside from the comfortable atmosphere, the food is awesome. Sandwiches have a tendency to get very repetitive and boring after awhile however Gordo makes sure to always spice things up! Their \"magic sauce\" that is used on a variety of sandwiches is delicious. Munchamania always has great daily specials that vary from items such as huge fresh-made salads, delicious soups and three cheese quesadillas. They even have speciality sandwiches that aren't on the menu but will graciously be offered to you such as \"The Truth\" and \"The Monsoon\" that will blow your mind.   This restaurant is definitely a must-try and I promise it will not disappoint you!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sandwich place in the whole valley in my opinion. I love sandwiches too!  The owners are great, super friendly and makes it a point to remember people and make them feel welcome, even when it is packed.  The food is awesome, and the service is fast. The prices are great. When I worked in the area I went there almost daily and it was cheaper than going to McDonalds etc to get a similar size meal. I tell everyone I know to go there, and you should check it out!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place since it is close to my office. Called an order in and they had it ready in 10 minutes. THE FOOD WAS AMAZING!  Everything on the menu sounded so good but I had the chicken salad on a croissant and a side of potato salad. The chicken salad was definitely home made and pure yummy goodness. My coworkers and I fell in love with this place and have decided it will be a regular for us on our lunch hour!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I haven't been in years but I went this afternoon with some friends I used to work with and it was still just as awesome. It's really rare that small places like this are as good as you remember so I give them a lot of credit. The place looks great, it's clean and the food is fantastic. I got my old favorite, #43 a chicken sandwhich on a wheat wrap and a side of their pasta salad and it brought me right back. Oh and one of my other personal favorites- REAL ICED TEA!! None of that nasty fake stuff. Prices are perfect for the times we are in, the place is always busy but really fast with the food and the atmosphere is cozy... all in all a great place to stop in for lunch by yourself, with friends or even with a client."}
{"text":"One of the better sandwich shops in Tempe, does get busy sometimes though. They also have a great breakfast I hear."}
{"text":"I own a business in the same plaza. We eat there daily for breakfast and/or lunch. THe best food around. Gordon and Mary are super friendly and their staff is terrific. We love you Muncha Mania!!"}
{"text":"Gordon and Mary are a staple mom n' pop shop in Tempe, Arizona. They have great, personable customer service and incredible food. Best sandwich shop in town. And then some. I might be biased since playing ball at ASU but rest assured, they won't disappoint. Love you Gordon and Mary! Lots of love and best wishes!   PS-Gordon has a secret menu newbies. Well worth the hassle of squeezing it outta him. Good luck."}
{"text":"I found this place through yelp when trying to find a new sandwich place around me.  I went on a Saturday, and it was closed but decided to come back on weekday to try a sandwich.  I am sure glad I did.  The owners are so friendly, the menu has a great variety of sandwiches, and the place is decked in maroon and gold.  I highly recommend this place for sandwiches, I have been going back once a week to try different sandwiches and every time I have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Arizona.   They're always friendly and willing to swap a story.  If u go with the specials u can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Best service anywhere, best sand which anywhere, and the 'magic sauce' is delicious. Super cheap, and everybody seems to be a regular ... literally, everybody."}
{"text":"I was brought to munch a few years ago by a college friend and have been a fan ever since. The prices are pretty inexpensive and the owners Gordon and Mary are some of the nicest people I have met. I havent been there for about a month and they still remembered my name and asked where I have been. I get the chicken sandwich with bacon, avocado and ask for the \"magic\" sauce. There is tons of ASU memorabilia on the walls, mainly softball and baseball. If your ever in Tempe for lunch, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"As all the other yelpers have said, Awesomely friendly owners. Nice Ma & Pa place Food is OK, but not memorable. Pancakes are from a packet mix, frozen packet homestyle potatoes meat was microwaved.  All the plates were styrofoam, cutlery was plastic. Very un-green"}
{"text":"Great lunch! Fresh ingredients. 1/2 salad size of a 9\"plate. Warm Meat sandwich 1 1/2 thick. Bread fresh. Brownie to die for! I forgot! Gordon and Mary are great host and hostess, personable, and friendly!"}
{"text":"A breakfast/lunch-only place driven by the local industrial and commercial buildings nearby, they have really good sandwiches!  Simple, quick, friendly - go enough times and they start to know you by name.  Their specials on the whiteboard are usually really unique, inventive, and super tasty (they had this one with a mustard sauce/dressing that I still get cravings for, but yet to see it again...).  They close around 2 or 3p so go only if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and he ordered for us.  He said, \"don't order off the menu. The best stuff isn't on there!\" We got the thunder and Monsoon and Veronica! And they were pretty tasty! It's a cute little place. The owners are extremely nice!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch for the first time since I'm working up in this area. The girls I went with go here every day. Literally, every day. I'm not sure I could do that - gotta have some variety!  But this place is good, food tasted great and it was super (super) busy. Pretty much all locals from what I could tell and they are here all the time. The owners knew everyone and what they normally order.  Menu seems to have a good selection and all the ingredients were fresh. I could seem them making sandwiches while we were eating.  I'm sure I'll be back if I stay working up here!"}
{"text":"Great place. Ordered the veggie sandwich and it was delicious! Everything tasted fresh and service was exceptional. Will definitely eat here again- and the owners were a delight!"}
{"text":"This place's greatest strength is its value proposition. Little cash, whole lot of breakfast burrito. There are various types but most include scrambled eggs, cheese, and hash browns inside the tortilla.   Unfortunately, Munch A Mania's breakfast food will not wow your taste buds. Pretty middle of the road, which isn't the greatest sin. The potatoes inside the burrito are not crispy. The carne asada burrito is really just breakfast burrito with beef, and in my opinion, the salsa served with every burrito should be replaced with another brand.   The owner is very friendly, and there's a lot of ASU decoration on the walls. I have no experience with its lunch menu."}
{"text":"Man great food and great people good prices one of the vary few places I do not get tired of eating at because such a good selection."}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot in Tempe, great atmosphere and their sandwiches can't be beat. Consistent and delicious"}
{"text":"Without a doubt my favorite lunch spot around. I go atleast once a week. The Dorman is insane. You can't go wrong with anything you choose. Listen to Gordon for condiments and other recommendations. EXTREMELY nice and courteous people."}
{"text":"Ate here today for lunch based on the high reviews. I had the italian sub and it was average. Staff was friendly but food average...at least the sandwich I had was. I prefer Mr. Goodcents over this."}
{"text":"The guy Gordon that works here is the man!!!! He's so funny and very helpful. Knows everything there is about sandwiches. He's also got a great sense of humor and even told us about the secret menu. There's \"The Truth\" and the monsoon. Both ridiculously delicious. A must go but only open till 2:30!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has awesome breakfast burritos. I traveled out to Tempe for work twice over the past few months and I would go to this place every morning. In addition to to the great breakfast burritos the couple that own the shop are the friendliest people you will ever meet. I am looking forward to my next trip to Tempe so I can go here again. I will be recommending this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely the freshest ingredients and more options for hot and cold sandwiches you could ever dream of. Fresh soups, cold slaw and potato salad."}
{"text":"This place has excellent sandwiches! I suggest that if you are going for lunch that you be prepared as this place is small and it draws a decent lunch crowd. The owner Gordon is very nice and accommodating. They also do take out orders and delivery depending on where you are located."}
{"text":"Perfect hole in the wall eatery. Prices are cheap, great service, and very good sandwiches."}
{"text":"This was delicious.  I went there and the owner who gives descriptions was not there.  So his wife helped us out.  She apologized that her husband was not there, but she tried her best and gave my party two delicious sandwiches.  One was \"the Truth\" and is was so tasty.  I cannot remember the name of the other one, but one was turkey and the other I believe was corn beef.  When we were there, they also had a daily special of tacos. I did not try it, but I saw it and it filled the plate it was on.  They prices are responsible and you have to love a \"mom & pop\" shop.  This is a must try."}
{"text":"This is a great local sandwich shop.  The guys from my local fire department brought me here on a previous trip and I stopped by again for a works sandwich and pasta salad.  It looks like this is family run and they do it right.  The menu has sandwiches numbered and a clear description of what's inside.  The sandwich I ordered was made quickly, put in a box and i was out within about 5 minutes, I had to make sure to grab my tasty pasta salad out of the cooler on my way out.    The price is right, the service is good, and its a good sandwich stop by if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Easily the best sandwich place in Tempe...and I'd argue that it's a top spot anywhere. Gordon and Mary are amazing and make you feel at home. The food is so good and I make it a point to visit at least once or twice a week."}
{"text":"I got the Roast Beef and Mushrooms with melted provolone on top. I have to say the sandwich was pretty tasty and it was a good price. The only down side on this sandwich was the use of canned mushrooms.. Fresh mushrooms would be so much better!! Come on guys!"}
{"text":"BEST. SANDWICH. EVER. I highly recommend \"The Truth\" sandwich. I don't think I've ever had a sandwich where when i'm leaving the restaurant, i wish i would've ordered another one to scarf down an hour later. Also, Mary and Gordon are awesome and always welcoming! Way to go, Munch A Mania!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is amazing... I've had many items on the menu breakfast and lunch ... Some of my favorites are the breakfast chorizo special.... The Reuben, bbq chicken salad that can feed 2 people.... The tacos!! All of it is amazing... Gordon the owner is friendly and funny always remembers my name... Even has nick names for some of my employees that eat their regularly. :) love it!!!!"}
{"text":"In the interstate of brevity,  I'll create a list of the positives and a list of the negatives.   THE POSITIVES-   Really good breads  large portions  nice tables  INCREDIBLY friendly owners. (the counter guy ?whom I assume is the owner ?took the time to explain the menu and even give me suggestions to save money)  they seem to know everyone who walks through the door. They engaged everyone in conversation and they check in on you and ask if you enjoyed your meal.    friendly atmosphere.   There was a line to the door,  but no one seems to mind the wait.  Whether it's because of the friendliness of the employees or the cramped size of the place, it seems like one of those places that you just want to hang out at.  quality meats diverse beverage selection (six different types of teas... I'm in heaven) expansive menu.   They offer breakfast and lunch with tons of choices for both menus.  homemade eats. The desserts look fresh from the oven.  The pasta salad was clearly made by the owners and the sandwiches are made to order.   Feel free to make customizations.  clean.  They took the time to make sure the tables stayed wiped down and the floors were clean.   high energy staff.  They found the balance between buzzing around without being annoying.   THE NEGATIVES-  INCREDIBLY small.   Seriously.  Don't come here if you have even a hint of closterphobia.  The tables are practically on to of each other.  Luckily,  there's a friendly atmosphere,  because you're practically sitting on your neighbors lap. yucky chip selection.  Everything is Kettle Cooked Lays.  They're in need of some serious diversity in the chip area.    Undistinctive cheese. I got American,  and it's the single crappies cheese I've ever had.  It's that crappy cheese from your elementary school.   And while I'm all for reliving my childhood,  I don't want to eat that again.   obnoxious wall colors lots of Styrofoam.  Styrofoam plates, strofoam cups and Styrofoam take- out boxes can't be good for the environment what's up with the TV showing soccer?   This is the USA.   We don't play that shit strip mall sub shop.  I'm always wary of strip mall subs. They're either really good or they'll give you food poisoning.   one of those up and coming places that has definitely outgrown their current location.     SUMMATION  It was a good meal.  Pretty good quality for the price.  Not mind blowing,  but I'd definitely come back. I'd drive out of my way for it."}
{"text":"Just walk in and order the Truth. You will get the best hot sandwich made.  Gordon and Mary are the nicest people."}
{"text":"Haven't had a sandwich this good in awhile. Never would have stopped here unless my Co worker didn't take me. Very glad he did. Wouldn't judge the place by its exterior. Very small place that can get crowded at lunch. Very inexpensive for how good the food is! The owner took our order and he knew a lot of people coming in. Incredibly friendly!"}
{"text":"You know a place is going to be good when the owner greets you with a fist bump.   Super-friendly owners who seemed to know all their customers. Unlike a surprisingly high number of restaurants, when I asked for suggestions they were eager to provide. I settled on a daily special (they have a full list of 'em available online for each day) of some kind of specially spiced meat in a breakfast burrito. It was excellent- not overwhelmingly huge and minced together so that every bite had an equal amount of flavors.   Great prices too- every item was on the lower end of price that I've seen for it but the quality appears to be spectacular.   The inside was also very clean and well-apportioned, which is a nice change from some of the more cramped Yelp favorites I've seen elsewhere. Bonuses included Barq's Red Creme Soda on tap as well as a surprisingly high variety of iced teas.  Awesome place, I'll make sure to stop here whenever I'm in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"I ordered the turkey #61, the meat was hot & tender, the bread average and the canned mushrooms grossed me out. Fresh mushrooms would make the sandwich much better. Overall it was average."}
{"text":"Gordon and Mary are fantastic! Food is great and reasonably priced. The breakfast is amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a really nice hidden gem in this area of Tempe. The people running the sandwich shop are so lovely and you can tell that they put so much effort into their sandwiches and it shows! I would highly recommend the \"truth\" sandwich which I actually learned about on here and decided to order it without knowing what it actually consists of. It doesn't really matter though because once you've tried this sandwich there's no going back! Easily one of the best sandwiches that I've ever had.  Their other sandwiches are great as well, tried one of their cold sandwiches (turkey) which I was satisfied with. I would recommend calling your order in as they do get very busy here and takeout is the better option it seems like. The prices are extremely reasonable and sandwiches are good, it's no wonder there is always a line close to being out the door every time I visit."}
{"text":"Mary and Gordon are the most kind-hearted, friendly, and compassionate people who just happen to run the best sandwich shop I've ever been to. Ive been to more deli's than I can count and this place is the only one that combines that home-cooked kitchen feel with the amazing food you would expect from a deli. I have been going there for years and love the atmosphere and great ingredients. I feel related to Gordon and Mary and their \"how we met\" story is something you'd expect out of a Romantic Comedy. Do yourself a favor and get to know them. They'll memorize your name in no time and make you a munchamaniac like me."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich places I've ever been to! Ingredients are fresh and of great quality. The family owned shop feels warm and welcoming upon walking in and being greeted by the husband wife duo with a smile every time makes me keep coming back almost every week! Definitely give this place a try, I swear you'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by my husband one day for lunch. WOW, what a find. The sandwiches are great, the owner and his wife are incredibly welcoming, and the people in the dining area all seemed to be regulars and happy to be there.   The sandwich I ordered, a #29 hot roast beef with mushrooms and provolone, was lovely.  I really enjoyed it. Simple and delicious.  If I'm in the area again, I will be sure to stop in."}
{"text":"Favorite place for a quick and easy sandwich.. I've ordered several times now and the owner knows me by name as well as most of the customers that come and go while I wait for my order.. The sandwiches are good sized and the special board changes daily.. I've enjoyed not only the food but going there.. you'll leave feeling like you've made a friend."}
{"text":"You can't beat this place for sandwiches.  #1 at 12:30 PM on a Wednesday it is packed.  I saw maybe 70 people in the time I waited for my two sandwiches to go.  Prices are $4.99 for almost any sandwich you can image and $6.50 for huge salads!  I waited longer than at other places but everything was so fresh it wasn't a problem, I will plan ahead next time.  Tried the vegetarian sandwich with cream cheese, cucumbers, sprouts and avocado on a white sub roll.  YUM!!!!  So much fresh, ripe avocado.  My kids shared the turkey sandwich with bacon and avocado on sour dough.    Large drinks are only $1.50 and they have two choices for fresh brewed tea.  They gave my kids a free drink and apologized that they didn't have any free cookies to throw in when our order was ready!!!    We seriously can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I just recently moved to the area for my job and am slowly trying out all the local lunch spots.  Heard about this place from a coworker and we all decided to hit them up today.    Very friendly staff, great selection of sandwiches and breakfast items as well.  Had a hot chicken sandwich but it was needing a little more to it.  Very tasty but the cheese was a little rich and could have done better on a sub roll (which you can choose I just didn't specify) with some lettuce tomato and onions.    We will definitely be back as they have a ton of sandwich choices! Great little \"hole in the wall\" lunch spot"}
{"text":"iv hit this place a few times now for breakfast  clean friendly and great food and prices ."}
{"text":"Muncha is our standard breakfast and lunch joint (when we order out) at my studio. It's a little hole-in-the-wall spot in an industrial area of Tempe. The owners are great; they staff the counter themselves and know their regulars. The sandwiches are generally enormous (I recommend the 61, turkey with italian dressing), and they've always got new daily specials. Substitutions and sandwich customization is a-OK with them.  They feed you -really- well for the price, I can't recommend them more!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little breakfast n lunch place. I had a huge breakfast burrito with homemade salsa. The peeps that I can only assume are owners, so so nice it made our breakfast enjoyable. Clean restaurant, polite employees/owners and great food...well deserving of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!!  Reasonable prices!!!! AND.... Awesome owners.  We go there at least twice a week.  Make sure to check out the \"today's highlights\" for daily specials on their website.  When we call for an order to go at lunchtime (no matter how much we order) it's ready and it's RIGHT even with substitutions.  Love this place :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting from Hawaii. We were looking for a quick bite to eat, and saw the Munch a Mania sign from the road. Not expecting much from the outside appearance, we walked inside and were surprised how good everything looked. The sandwiches looked incredible. We got two salads and they were plenty big, my wife couldn't finish all of hers. The owners were very helpful and friendly. We'll be sure to come visit munch a mania when we come back to Arizona. Great casual dining experience. Aloha!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the people are really friendly and like to talk to their customers what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I work right next to this place so it's very convenient. Mary and Gordon are all around really cool people and they make good breakfast and lunch. My favorite is the chorizo burrito supreme."}
{"text":"It's finding places like this that remind me why it is great to be a yelper. I was looking for something different to do for lunch than my usual spots so I hopped on here and found Munch A Mania and I am very glad I did. This little hole in a wall, or in this case industrial strip mall, is one of those hidden gems that you need to be connected to find out about.  The location itself is unassuming but the food is anything but. I walked in with no idea what I wanted and it got even harder to choose once i saw the menu where everything looked great and inexpensive as well. In the end I went with a meatball sub combo, I think the total was $7 less than I spend at subway for a foot-long. i was also impressed by the use of an iPad & Square to pay, as a tech nerd I always enjoy seeing that kind of thing get used, also shows me that the owners are willing to think outside the box.  The sub was good as the bread seemed fresh, the meatballs were well sized and full of meat and not too much bread/filler. The meatballs and sauce were actually flavorful which is more than I can say for subway. Also the sub with a bag of chips was just about the perfect sized lunch, i was full but not overly so. Definitely enough of a pleaser to convince me to come back and try some of the other subs i passed on for the meatball.  I am holding off the extra star until I can get back and try a more standard cold cut sub but I am doubting it will be long before I stop by again. If you want to try something different for lunch I say come check this out as it is a welcome change to the standard chain sub shops that are a dime a dozen in Tempe."}
{"text":"There are some restaurants that I have to eat at a few times before I will give my rating. This is not one of them. This is an easy five stars from the moment I walked in. Supercasual, small dining area, great food, wonderful owners/servers.  It is a small restaurant with lots to choose from. I don't want to say sandwich shop because they serve other items.  I was surprised at the length of their menu and then found out they have a number of hidden items to choose from. It is very casual like a sandwich shop should be.  The food is outstanding. I will be coming back even though I live about 30 miles away. If I drive by I will be stopping. I am recommending it to all of my friends.  I had \"the truth\", an off-menu sandwich, that was outstanding.  I would recommend asking the owner what he thinks you should have, and go from there.  The owner and operator has been here with his wife for 21 years. Super local with ASU on every wall.  Even though they were busy, he took time to tell me a little bit about himself and his wife. Really nice people who must truly enjoy what they do. They knew everybody by name, and asked if they wanted their usual or something different.  The best thing I can say about this restaurant is I hope I get to be a regular where they know my order too."}
{"text":"This is a hangout for \"bros\" \"dudes\" and \"guidos\" that miss their football coach from high school. The food is decent (even though they gave me the wrong sandwich) but it is so disorganized with the owner trying to make guys that look like arnold schwarzenegger feel okay because they can't pass English 101 for the 3rd time. Overall the whole process sucked (I'm not kidding, verbatim he was complaining about taking english 101 for the fourth time)."}
{"text":"Nice owner, clean place, but prepackaged or canned food that is microwaved. Wow after reading the reviews and seeing 4.5 stars I had some expectations. I only had lunch here so this is only a lunch review. I had an oriental salad, not very oriental; tomatoes,bagged lettuce mix, with crispy Chinese noodles (right put the blue can). My friend had number 29. Hot sub roast beef with melted provolone and Parmesan cheese. Mushrooms were canned and sub microwaved. It's a bit pricey for the quality of the food. If you don't want to fix your own lunch and are okay with prepackaged food it's fine. The owners were nice and the place was clean."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! Amazing food and The owners, Gordon and Mary, are so accommodating and friendly. This is a hidden gem of Tempe and a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to yelp and really glad we gave it a try.  I ordered a turkey sandwich on sourdough with cucumbers added and that sandwich absolutely rocked!  If this place was closer to my work I'd probably get lunch here every day.  I like that they keep their website updated with daily specials but I was disappointed on the day that we ordered that their daily special soup did not match what was posted on the website.  I guess we'll call and verify in advance next time.  The soup that we ended up with was still good but I'd really been hoping for the advertised special soup.  Sandwiches are amazing and I would absolutely order from here again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Arizona. I used to go here at least once a week during college, but graduated 5 years ago. I went back this week with my wife on our honeymoon and was shocked that the owners Gordon and Mary remembered me. They are two of the best people I have ever met. They have excellent customer service and their 58 sandwich on a croissant is the best sandwich I've ever had. Their sausage breakfast croissant sandwich is excellent as well. I can't wait to stop by the next time I'm in Tempe. Hopefully before another 5 years go by. Thank you again Gordon and Mary. You guys are the best!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Tempe. Best sandwich shop in Phoenix! Ask for a side of magic when ordering."}
{"text":"Great breakfast burrito!!! We were just passing through Tempe to visit family. These 'Iowegians' had a great breakfast! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Freshly sliced meats on fresh bread. Kicks the crud out of Subway."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 6 stars. Why have I not left a review for Gordon & Mary yet?!  This is by far my favorite lunch spot in Tempe. Gordon makes sure everyone has a laugh when they stop in, and is always on point. This really feels like a small town restaurant - I am always impressed to see Gordon & Mary know and remember so many different people by name.   The food is awesome. Sandwiches are always good, not expensive, and filling. If you like salads, they have literally any dressing I could think of.   If you come in at lunch, expect a wait - but the wait is always worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in the Tempe area because of the friendly service, the high quality quick food, and location. It's just enough out of the way of the ASU campus that it doesn't feel overwhelmingly busy.   I highly recommend any of the breakfast items! They're reasonably priced, and the burritos especially could (probably) feed you for two meals."}
{"text":"over the years I have eaten at mucha mania several times. the food is mediocre which is fine if you don't mind paying ten bucks for a sandwich you can make at your house. what makes this place crappy and extra crappy is the customer service. The owner/counter guy is extremely rude! its worse on the phone.  update: went in after a year or so-I lost about 100 lbs, owner guy askes me if that fat fu#k with the same name still works over there? he was not joking"}
{"text":"I have eaten here for years, and have never been disappointed! Gordon and Mary are awesome, and make you feel at home! Overall great food and service!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for lunch! First time today and had amazing food with friendly people. 5 stars. I will be back. Get anything on the menu and be satisfied!"}
{"text":"My office moved up to Scottsdale Mall from near Munchamania, oh how I miss Mary and Gordon. Awesome people, love their customers and the customers love them. I saw a review here from a guy who didn't get his Tempe Tap, poor guy didn't realize it is so casual you have to grab your own cup!  It's like being at your uncle's house. But the food is better :-)  Always ask Gordon what he recommends, the Truth, A B or C specials,  etc.  I like their  old sandwiches better than their hot, but their Meatball is a can't miss basic also.  Nothing fancy or \"fusion\" here to confuse. Solid deli food, ASU student level prices,  awesome people.    Go here and you will feel welcome and happy and full."}
{"text":"Best quick Sandwiches around!! I work close to this place so it's always convenient for lunch. Gordon always has my sandwich ready to go within 5 minutes of calling in! Saguaro sandwich is my go to!"}
{"text":"Lived across the street from this hidden gem for 8 years. Recently discovered their amazing sandwiches and customer service! I wish they were open later so I could go after work hours!"}
{"text":"GOOD! But always busy! Fresh food made to order, but try to phone in order cause they are always packed. Small dinning area but again....good food."}
{"text":"As a long time MAM customer, I had to write a review. If you are a student, professor, business person or a drive by, take heed.   This is possibly the definition of bad food... everything, and I mean everything, is store bought, day old, and two to three times the market price. As a corporate customer, these people have taken advantage of everything we do, from board meetings to employee events, Gordon and team makes sure they get their pound of flesh. Great value? Hardly....  Food - Get ready for Safeway and Fry's good.... average at best. The best whipped up kraft and walmart sauces will delight your palet.   Service - If Gordy waits on you, please. No forks, no thanks, nothing. Mary is great, her husband, just like a retired golf pro, is good for nothing.   Location - Well its close to ASU, kind of. I would suggest Chompies, Sub Factory and maybe a vending machine at the airport.   Price - If you are a corporate customer, grab your wallet and run. Gordy needs a new driver. What an absolute rip off. Really...  Summary= Way better to be had. An embarrassment for the great town of Tempe"}
{"text":"It's like the wonderful food from Zeus's own kitchen fell down from the clouds and worked its way into the undeserving hands of mortals.  Go there, and start with \"The Truth\" or the French Dip. You WILL NOT be unsatisfied. I've tried hundreds of sandwiches in my life, but this is quite literally far and beyond the greatest of them all.  The prices are beyond reasonable, the food is incredible and fresh, the portions are more than enough, and the atmosphere is lovable. Say goodbye to your real parents! Gordon and Mary Munch are your new parents. They will treat you better than you deserve. Gordon is the artist- don't tell him what to do with the sandwiches. Trust him. Let him guide you through your Munchamorphisis.   Once you become a Munchamaniac, there's no going back. My roommate and I discovered this place about a year ago, and we've been going roughly twice a week since then. It's THAT good. I've never had a bad experience at Munch. Nearly everyone at Munch is a regular- we see the same crowd every day. Nobody stumbles here by accident. There's a reason for everything. The only two types of people at Munch are the regulars and the friends of the regulars. We've brought dozens of our closest friends here, and we've created a bit of a cult. They all come back as frequently as life allows.  Remember, you DO NOT deserve Munch A Mania. But if you're lucky enough, it will call to you. All we mere mortals can do is pass on the favor by telling our friends about it."}
{"text":"Love this place.friendly staff. Great food. The owner always greets and makes sure everything is perfect."}
{"text":"tasty! Inexpensive and a daily favorite.  This place is like your neighborhood restaurant, This place is frequently visited by plenty of workers, students and they are all usual's; that is a sign that this place is incredibly  delicious and consistently successful. The hot sandwiches are filling and savoring, try the rueben, or the pizza sub. The salads are big and very fresh. This place is a weekly default and i dont get tired of eating here!"}
{"text":"I went here for a sandwich  (the #20 with Ham, Bologna, Genoa Salami, Capocolla, Cooked Salami, American & Provolone Cheese) and thought it was absolutely delicious.  The sandwich meat was extremely tasty, although the bread was admittedly about average.    It seemed like everyone in the place knew one another, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your perspective (I was eating alone so felt slightly out of place, although the man and woman running the place were both very courteous and friendly).  However, I do think that if you want to feel like you are eating a homemade sandwich in a friend's kitchen, this would be a good place to go.     Another yelper suggested that this is \"pricey,\" which I think is strange.  A full size sandwich or a half sandwich/soup costs 5 dollars -- that strikes me as a fairly inexpensive lunch.  The menu is online, so you can decide yourself if eating here is going to bust your budget."}
{"text":"Grodo is one of the best business owners in town. His wife and himself created one of the best sandwich shops I have ever ate at. For the price for the service for the quality of food it doesn't come close anyone who is anyone needs to come into much a mania if they are in Tempe"}
{"text":"Great local place with all kinda of interesting lunches."}
{"text":"Wonderful mom and pop feel breakfast/lunch place. Delicious food for affordable prices    When I go here for breakfast I'm always greeted with welcoming smiles and delicious food."}
{"text":"Love this finding places like this! I've been coming to see Mary and Gordon for quite sometime now and am I glad I found them. Food is amazingly fresh and made with love. There isn't one thing on the menu I haven't tried. If you're a first timer i'd suggest one of the daily specials but whatever you're in the mood for you won't be disappointed I promise. Don't forget about the sides too! The pasta salad is a must try item."}
{"text":"Friendly attention and good for a breakfast stop. I had BBCTO and it was enough to start the day. Place does seem to have a fix sort of clients, and you will feel like eating in the kitchen of somebody for the familiarity they are welcome."}
{"text":"We headed here because of great reviews. We were so pleased we found this wonderful little spot. All the locals come here and the owners, Gordon and Mary, know all of them. It is such a friendly place. But onto the food--it was outstanding!!  I had a salad--I don't know what it was called as I let Gordon choose for me. He asked me what dressing I liked and a couple other questions and I was delivered a delicious salad with very fresh greens, the best tomatoes I've eaten in months, avocados, freshly cooked and shredded chicken and more. The chipotle ranch dressing was excellent. Mary said that if it was too spicy she'd bring me something else. It was perfect. My husband had a ham sandwich (#3) with cheese, avocado, lettuce,tomato, etc. on wheat bread. It was outstanding as well.  I can't recommend this spot highly enough. Great food, great people, great experience!"}
{"text":"Great spot! We come here for breakfast often. Great menu. Staff is always friendly. Just wish they were open at 6 am cause I'm starving right now and restaurant at my golf course doesn't open til 7am."}
{"text":"We stopped here on the way to our realtor office from the airport, on the advice of the Yelpers, because we were new to the area.  My husband had some delicious pancakes, but he was totally bummed that he didn't put in an order for the breakfast quesadilla I had.  It was amazing!    The owners were wonderfully friendly and had a bit of good advice for new transplants from Michigan.  We were in ASU country, wearing Michigan State Spartan gear, yet we were still treated well, even if we swore we'd never change! ;)  Lots of regulars here, which is a good sign that a restaurant is doing something right.  Thanks so much for the hospitality, you made our first ever stop in Arizona a memorable one!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. It is a mix of fast food and a general greasy spoon. It was a very clean place and the people that were running it (who were also the owners) were extremely nice. There menu is very small but they can make anything you want. I had a two meat burrito. This burrito came with your choice of two meats (sausage, bacon, ham) eggs, cheese pinto beans and potatoes! The thing was huge and after tax it only cost me $4.86! Filled me up perfectly!"}
{"text":"My job is about 1/2 a mile from this place.  I drove by one day and decided to go in and eat lunch.  Best choice I have ever made.  My boss buys our lunch from here once a week.  The salads are the best around, are huge and a great price.  Gordon & Mary are the best.  The place is always crowded/busy no matter what day I go in."}
{"text":"Best food, prices and owners. Consistently great experience every time I come! Gordon and Mary (the owners) are great and treat their customers like family!"}
{"text":"Great people, average food. I had the long islander sandwich on a sub. The guy at the counter was a nice guy crackin a couple jokes. But the food wasn't anything that would bring me back.. The meat wasn't flavorful and the coleslaw tasted/looked exactly like the stuff you get at Walmart when you're late to a tailgate and need to bring something. But overall it's a alright neighborhood joint where they know your name and can talk about how the ASU squads are doin."}
{"text":"First timer here. Had to visit based upon the stellar reviews this place gets.  Its very, very old school here, but I like the feeling. Its different from the usual atmosphere you get at the other places. For a mom and pop shop, the prices for the food were very reasonable, and the food was also definitely very good. It gets really busy during lunch, but that doesn't really make the service any worse. Except for the fact that I asked for a water, and the guy at the counter (Gordon?) asked if I wanted 'Tempe tap' or bottled. I asked for tap, and then....nothing happened.  My italian beef came out surprisingly fast, and it was quite delicious. For $6.25 you get a sandwich and some chips which is pretty good. Except for the fact that they pretty much only have Poore Brothers chips, which is awesome.   Have to take a star off because there is no tap water on their fountain. I ended up having to go to my car to grab my bottle of water for my lunch.  Other than that, really good sandwiches for the price. Decent service."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after just passing by, right place at the right time. The owners (I'm assuming) were working and they were as nice as a person could be! The place was packed for lunch and the prices were great. The sandwiches were great and all you could ask for from a quick sandwich spot. I'd definitely go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great local business with local sports posted all on the walls. I spent under $8 for an enormous chicken bacon ranch salad on special that was delicious. Friendly staff and owner!"}
{"text":"I used to live across the street from Munch a Mania and always wondered how the store survived since they were only open during the week at daytime hours.  Once I finally got a chance to make it in there with my husband and a friend I realized exactly how they stay open.  Great food, great service, and really make you feel at home.  The owner's Gordan and Mary go out of there way to make you feel welcome by remembering your name, asking you how you are doing, and making sure you are satisfied with their food.  It kept my husband and I going back every time.  Definitely a great place to eat in Tempe during the week!   I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!!! Turkey croissant sandwich is the best!!! So much turkey, sprouts, and avocado! Can't go wrong with this sandwich!!!  Wish they were open on the weekends!   To good to close!"}
{"text":"5 stars because of the good food, good prices, Gordon, and Square Pay.   Took a few co-workers here because I heard great things about this place. Its always nice when a recommendation lives up to expectations because friends can quickly turn to obnoxious jerks when given the chance.  Gordon is super friendly, he somehow knows how to hit it off with any personality that comes in. Also be sure to ask for suggestions you might just end up with the Truth or some Thunder and Monsoon.  Prices are more expensive than Subway but the food is way better.  The sandwiches remind me of the way Paradise Bakery services them, square, not submarines but at a better price.  Another great thing about this place is you can Pay with Square. If you haven't used it before, it works like this:  Setup a profile with Square and when you walk into a business that uses Square your name and picture automatically appear on the register.  Your just order you food and go, you don't ever have to touch your wallet or smart phone. It is freaking amazing!  Awesome place, makes Tempe feel like the college town it should be."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today with some co-workers. Yum-meeeeee!!! The small dining room stays busy was customers coming in and out to order the delicious food. Many of the customers looked like regulars. The staff seemed to have a great relationship with the customers as they filtered in and out of the restaurant. Friendly staff that made you feel at home. I'll be going back to this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Gordon & Mary are the best!! I am a frequent morning customer. Food is always good and plentiful!!"}
{"text":"Great sandwich! Friendly staff! I had the works sandwich on ciabatta bread. The sandwich was a s big as the to go container! Definitely worth the money!"}
{"text":"Wow! Small town feel breakfast spot. Huge portions and the friendliest staff. Great suggestions from locals for things to do. Gordon was very welcoming almost as if I was in his house having breakfast. Thank you for such a great experience. A MUST!"}
{"text":"Good value for money - popular - and they have a home made salsa which is spicy and delicious.  For a solid low cost option you can't go wrong.  The only negative I found was the disposable tableware, but that's a minor point as the food + service were excellent."}
{"text":"I have been going to Munch a Mania for lunch with my boyfriend for about a year now.  My current sandwich crush is Veggie Galore with Turkey.  It comes loaded with sprouts, avocado, and cucumber slices, and the whole time I am stuffing my mouth I wonder how Gordon and Mary are making any money off of this sandwich.  The prices are extremely reasonable, and we usually walk out of there with spending about $10.  Even the deli counter at Sprout's grocery store can't beat Munch A Mania's prices and freshness. If you are person who likes the Mom & Pop feel and want the owners to get to know you, this place is perfect."}
{"text":"Is my favorite sandwich shop in the valley! Very reasonably priced extremely fresh food and pleasant people to dine with.  Check out the specials, they're always great! And they now except Apple Pay!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food at this place period. A friend and I both got hot sandwiches. I got the Ruben he got one with mushrooms and green peppers. First, my sandwich wasn't hot, wasn't grilled, and I didn't finish it. When watching the sandwich makers build sandwiches something very odd kept occurring. They put their hot sandwiches in the microwave. The MICROWAVE!!! How is this even possible. I was absolutely ashamed to have come. My friends sub was dripping all over the place and turns out it was from canned mushrooms. Yes, canned mushrooms on a sandwich. Absolutely inexcusable. I wouldn't recommend anything warm from this place but a few of the cold sandwiches are probably tasty. I will never know because I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Had a chance to stop in today and check out this Tempe staple.  Gordon, the owner is super personable and friendly!  Ask him for the best sand which he has to offer and he will serve you up a Monsoon, and I promise it to be finger licking good!  Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really good grub with that mom/pop feel. I've grabbed probably 100 meals out of there and literally every single one was great."}
{"text":"Got a Reuben with sauerkraut on the side for take-away. It's listed in the \"Hot Sandwiches\" menu. Turned out it was anything but - which is a surprise because I work very close by. Beyond that, the pastrami was unsavory and the thousand island was a runny soup that didn't do much to make up for the low temperature.  Chompies up the street knows how to make a tasty Reuben (albeit over-sized); I regret not grabbing my sandwich there. Won't be getting another Reuben at Munch-a-mania, but I might try breakfast sometime hoping for better results."}
{"text":"Munch A Mania is hands down one of the best small business restaurants ever. Gordon is the man and will make sure you do not leave his restaurant hungry! Phenomenal food, specials, and an amazing environment. Definitely would recommend trying, or becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"Huge line, still fast, still delicious, and of course the owner is absolutely awesome : ) he always knows just what I want even if I'm on the fence and he remembers me every time. If I had more than 1 person per shift at my coffee shop I'd be running over here all the time for my breakfast and lunch! Mmmmmmm"}
