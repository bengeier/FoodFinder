{"text":"Pulling up to the building in the middle of an industrial park, threw me off a little bit the first time we came, and the name of the store has changed to a more upbeat \"The Dutch Store\", however it is the same business it has always been for the last 30 or so years. There is room enough to park in front of the store for about 4-6 cars, so if it is busy, you might have an issue with parking, however this seems to never be the case, there's always space. This was the same store in the same building where my parents brought me when they were buying their Dutch Gouda Cheese and Speculaas (that a dutch spiced cookie you would eat with coffee) and now i'm doing the same today.  The store is in a smaller area, but it still carries all the necessary items, licorice, breakfast spreads and flakes, rusks, soups and soup mixes, dutch cheese (aged, medium, mild, and spiced), and might I also mention that the prices are very competitive and cheaper than Superstore or Co-op. For instance, an 1/8 wheel of cheese will run you about $17-20 at the Dutch Store where the same block will run you over $30.00 at any other grocery store, not to mention they won't carry half the selection of dutch cheeses either.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable with all their products and helpful with any questions on what a particular product might taste like. They also accept Visa, Mastercard, Cash and Debit (with no additional \"fees\").  A truly remarkable experience and don't forget to grab a pack of Coca Cola Mentos on the way out.  They also carry one of the largest selections of Mentos flavors in the city."}
{"text":"Best place in Calgary to get Dutch goods. My family has been going here for years. The staff is knowledgable and friendly prices are great. The locations seems off but that's how they keep the prices so low. Defently worth checking out you will not be disappointed. If it's Dutch you will find it. They also sell other items like decorations and shoes. If you can't find it there there pretty willing to order it in for you.  So go check this place out its sooo worth it"}
{"text":"Formally Called The Dutch Cash & Carry now called The Dutch Store part of the Western Grocery building. I have been coming here for years with my Dad & Mom and my kids and now they go with their kids.  Has expanded over the years to add more European items.   You can find Cheese, herring, smoked eel, croquettes and gooey stroopwaffle (that you put on top of your hot coffee or hot chocolate to soften it up), Dutch cookies, chocolates, oh and don't forget double salt liquorice!  Now besides the food items you can find great quality towels,  cookware and dishes.  Souvenir, puzzles, shirts and orange sports items.  Parking is questionable at time, on the street and the small unmarked parking lot just outside the entrance.  You can find yourself boxed in if not careful on how you're parked.  The smell of the store brings back yummy memory's.   Well worth the stop if you have never been.  You too will be a returning customer!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here my entire life, but it wasn't until recently that I understood this place had an actual business name. Growing up, my mom, aunts, and Oma all called it \"The WOP\". Dutch Cash & Carry is located in the same building as Western Alberta Produce (WAP), so I assume that with my Oma's Dutch accent, WAP became WOP and the rest is history.  DC&C carries all of the Dutch favourites like hagelslag, appelstroop, bitterballen, gouda, drop, stroopwafel, and so much more:  http://stuffdutchpeoplelike.com/complete-list/"}
