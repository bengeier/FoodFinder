{"text":"YEA! Yelp to the rescue again...

Looking for a new Italian place and Yelp sent us to Zizi's... and it was delicious! In a party of 8, every single one of us had a great meal. 

Service was great, decor is beautiful, wine selection decent, and although their deserts did seem to be bought, I can highly recommend the limoncello truffle!
Thanks Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I was trying to find somewhere in Vaughan, where we could take my parents to celebrate their anniversary. I was calling various places that were either booked, super expensive, or odd (i.e. didn't have high chairs for my child). So I remembered Zizi, and called the morning of a Saturday I wanted to get a dinner reservation for. I didn't think we would get a table in time, but someone called me back, and said they had a private party booked inside, so we could get a table on their patio. It was a beautiful day, so I was just happy to get a table. 

When we got there, our waiter was friendly, knew a lot about the menu and specials, accommodated my child with setting up a high chair, bringing her some bread, etc. The food was delicious! All of us ordered something different, and all five of us were happy with our meals. Delicious, portion sizes were great, and we all took leftovers home. We had muscles and bruschetta as apps, and they were wonderful. As the mains, we had penne Alla vodka (best ever), fettuccini Alfredo, a spicy sausage and spaghetti, roasted fish, and chicken in a mushroom cream sauce. The wine was great and chocolate cake was yum. Nothing bad to say about this place at all. 

Thank you for accommodating us Zizi, and giving my parents a special night! We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Always good food and awesome service. My go to restaurant in Woodbridge!"}
{"text":"Went there based on the reviews and here is my summary:
Food is pretty good. My dish was great (chicken oui oui) but my husbands was meh (Italian suasage pasta). Deserts are nothing special.
Men's bathroom apparently smells aweful (like sewer).
Clean place.
Very nice and knowledgeable staff.

I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"Nice place, worth the money you spend.
Real italian place. I had both pizza, pasta or main entree and nevers disappointed"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Ontario! We discovered it by visiting Toronto 2 years ago and we stayed in Woodbridge and ate here and it is still as good as the first day.

The food is fresh and delicious, the pizzas are so creative and the portions are great! I usually opt for the fettuccine which the veggies change on it depending on the season , its absolutely delicious. Their pizzas are cooked perfectly as well and the salads are very typical but so delicious! The wine selection is great and the servers are well versed and what pairs well together.

The service is really friendly and knowledgable, there were a couple times we felt forgotten about and had to flag them down but otherwise they were great. 

The atmosphere is fabulous, they are busy weekend nights and during the week its so very romantic. I love the food here!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Zizi for my husband's birthday for the first time. It was a group of 6 people. Because I read good reviews about this place I was expecting the best Italian food. Well, the food was not the best I had. Out of 8 dishes half was great and half was just ok.
Service was nice, but I had to wait for water a few times. I didn't feel that we were checked on regularly. I ordered icecream for dessert, it was delicious, but it could be presented to much better. I think I do a better job at home serving icecream to my family. Overall I have seen a better Italian place."}
{"text":"The best Italian meal I've had in a long time. The food was fresh and authentic. I took the waiter's recommendation on the seafood pasta special. The pasta was home-made, the seafood was fresh and the sauce was delicious. He also recommended the perfect wine pairing and dessert with cappuccino. We finished it off with a cold limoncello. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Pollo Rossi.....delicious! Great  food, kind staff. Looking  forward  to dinning there soon. I used  to visit  the  one  on Bloor yeeeeaaars ago. Hidden  gem to the  people  of Toronto."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here based on the other reviews that I have read here. Unfortunately, every one of them were off. I had the lamb which was tasteless to the point that it could have been any meat. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh; it had a taste - It tasted like burnt diapers. I substituted the potatoes and veggies for a pasta. I didn't realize that pasta was a suitable vegetable substitute, but then again, what do I know. The pasta had a unique aroma - like big foot's armpits. Intoxicating! So overall, I would obviously recommend this. 5 stars... Or there about."}
{"text":"This place was just how it was described in most of the other reviews.  Really good food but the service was excellent when we had it, it was spotty throughout the night. I had the champagne risotto and the capoacino truffle for dessert.  Both were amazing. Not really sure if we had an assigned waiter or waitress.  Would have been 5 stars if the service was a little more attentive. What was great was it made us comfortable to take our time. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  The olive oil and balsamic vinegar was good quality with the bread.  I had the seafood gnocchi and cappacino coffee gelato dessert was all very good .  Service was excellent !"}
{"text":"Food:  The food is family style Italian food. It's ok. it didn't wow me. The portion is huge!! Especially the pasta dishes. Pricing is reasonable with the amount they provide. 

Services:  They are friendly or nice, even the owner.  I don't know if I can use slow to describe them.  Maybe not too attentive.  It took them forever to see my glass of water was almost empty.  Took them forever to a lot of things.  I think the owner pays more attention to his regular customers.  But, overall, not too bad but plenty of room for improvement.  Also, I used Open Table to reserve a table, they didn't know.  But I got seated anyway. 

Parking:  In a small shopping center/mall, so there're some parking spaces.

Recommend?  Umm.... only to the ones who like family style Italian food and love big portions.  I prefer fancy Italian food more.

Revisit?  Nope.  Unless there are no other decent food to pick."}
{"text":"Drove by this place for 10 years and never tried it and I wish I tried sooner.
Overall, pretty good. I will compare with Marcello's which is another great Italian restaurant in the area.

Bread -   Marcello's over Zizi
They didn't give us neither olive oil or balsamic vinegar, and the bread was dried out a little. Seemed like it was sliced about an hour before we got there.

Grilled Calamari  - Tied
Marcello's $12 - 3 pieces
Zizi  $13 - 2 pieces 
It's more expensive but very tender and tasty. 
Last time I had it at Marcello's it was chewy. 

Atmosphere 
They are pushing for more fine dining look, but I don't think it's really working out. 
The table runner is awkward and the giant curtain at the entrance looked out of the place. 
The dining area was too dark as well.

Pizza was OK, but the fish I tried was delicious. It was one of the special of the day. Pricey for its portion though."}
{"text":"My sister turned 25 today and in true diva fashion told us we were going out to dinner because she wanted Zizi's. I had never tried it before but she was adamant about our family eating there.

Let me explain something here: my family rarely eats out because my folks are super picky. I am the adventurous one that eats raw fish and alligator whereas they stick to what they know and at the end of all visits concur that \"homemade is better\". 
My father and mother ordered the chef specials tonight (no substitutions no alterations...) 
Dad: Grilled veal chop with veggies in a white wine, mushroom and oyster reduction. ($33)

Mom: fresh-made pasta with mussels, shrimp and calamari in a rose sauce.($23)

Our table also had: mixed green salad, calamari fritti (fried), minestrone, pizza margarita and pollo rossi (grilled chicken with side veggies in a mushroom cream.)

My mother's plate was empty. She's a small lady. She will always leave food on the plate. She loved it!
She also went home and held my 4month old nephew for the first time so we are calling it a family lunar eclipse!

My dad \"el asador\" had nothing but good things to say about his meat!

So here are my final words, no more babbling- I promise:
The place is beautifully decorated and the menu itself is very much upscale. The food is deliciously prepared with quality and creativity. 
The service is friendly and prompt. I ordered a soup and me thinks they forgot it...I would normally make a remark on here about it but they were apologetic and so kind about it that I would not count it against them. (So I'm merely sharing the experience as if you were all there with me).

I loved it, I will be back!

You made my parents happy and your minestrone reminded me of my sweet Nonna (who I'm certain is smiling down from Heaven telling the angels hers was better but she's glad to see me eating).

Please allow me to add this note: ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T ORDER ALL THOSE MEALS IN MY
PICS IN ONE VISIT I DID TAKE MY FORK AND EAT OFF OF EACH FAMILY MEMBER'S PLATE. (My reviews are as honest as I can make them, and I do try) I'm a real person with a real review about food I actually ingested!!"}
{"text":"Zizi has been around for years and years and all the time I spend in Woodbridge I had yet to try it.  Finally after all these years I was able to try it out.  Anyone who dine's in the Woodbridge area knows that there is an Italian restaurant on almost every corner.  Makes you wonder how they all stay in business with all the competition.  Well the goal is to make sure you stand out from the others by being different.  Well Zizi's does just that.  Friendly staff great set up and great food.  We were a large group which usually restaurants want you to choose a set menu for large paerties.  We were able to order straight off the menu which was great.  We ordered fried calamari and bruschetta for the table for sharing.  They were both amazing.  For my main dish I ordered the veal marsala but instead of the veggies I got a side of penne a la vodka.  The portion was huge.  There was 4 pieces of veal and a decent portion of pasta as well.  I found that the veal was a bit to sweet for my liking but that is just my personal preference.  Did not stop me from almost licking the plate :).  Looking across the table I noticed that everyone's plate was super packed in.  The portions were huge.  Great opportunity for me to try everyone else's dish.  Seeing as I made my first trip to Zizi's it has now opened the door to many more visits to come."}
{"text":"Very delicious! Today we were unable to eat inn and had catered and had gotten take out.
We absolutely loved the voicemail! It was very uplifting and hilarious! We left a message and had received a call back within an hour. We had placed our order and it as ready exactly as we requested within an hour.
All the food was very good, well made. Fresh and clean.
My only tiny minor complaint or comment is I felt the meats, and seafood were slightly over cooked on the grill, and the whole selection of food options weren't on the online menu. Otherwise, very good service, professional and respectful and good quality food"}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant in Woodbrdige for Italian food.

The pastas are top notch and I have also tried the Bistecca Zizi which was really good. 

My only issue here is the small selection of pastas. I understand it is better for food cost and easier for kitchen speed to have a smaller menu but an expanded pasta selection could go a long way."}
{"text":"We arrived at 9pm and there were people in the restaurant, but nobody was in line. They were men standing chatting in the patio. However when we entered the first thing the owner said was sorry we are closed.  They were not closed and Yelp said the closing time on a Saturday was not until 11pm. Talk about conceited.

I'm glad we didn't go after reading some of the reviews about the haphazard food. Instead we had a great meal at Milestones nearby."}
{"text":"We went here for a business dinner and found the food to be average. The service and ambiance was good. 
The stracciatella soup was really good as a starter. However the veal picatta in lemon sauce was a little tough and the sauce was over powering on the tart side."}
{"text":"This place is great and close to my office so it's great for lunch meetings, amazing food, large portions, and great prices. The wait staff are very courteous.
Definitely recommended. My favourite item on the menu is the angel hair pasta with crab and mussels."}
{"text":"After dining there once, I would not go back.  My biggest annoyance was the service: the menu has printed in bold \"No splitting of bills.\"  Since we were a group birthday dinner, we asked the server before we ordered, are we able to get separate bills (which I consider different than \"splitting the bill.\") He directed us to look at the menu where it says no splitting bills. When we asked if he could just take them as 6 separate orders, he again said no. I said, \"Can I ask why?\" and he explained that if we each wanted our own bill, it couldn't be done because it takes too much time to input 6 times in the computer... Anyways, we spent the dinner deciding who was going to pay on their card and trying to sort out how everyone was gonna e-transfer; then when he finally came with the card machine, he said, \"Ok, so how many different cards do we have?\" we were surprised and said, \"I thought you had said we couldn't split the bill?\" And he said, \"No no, you can use as many different cards as you want.\" I told him he didn't explain that...obviously he could have said that at the beginning, as all we wanted was to avoid one person having to pay the whole thing. Anyways, by the time we each calculated everything and paid 6 times, I swear it would have been faster for him to just give us 6 different bills. My next annoyance was that the dessert menu had no prices on it. I asked the (different) server what the prices are and he blankly said, \"All the same.\" When I pointed out there was no price on the menu, he just stared at me and said he didn't know and had to go look it up. This was quite strange. As for the food, I was very disappointed. The seafood risotto was honestly tasteless! Also, it was so loud in there I actually could not hear the person sitting next to me. Needless to say I will not be going back, nor recommending this place to anyone."}
{"text":"What a great little secret. The food is authentic Italian and very tasty. I have visited a few Italian restaurants  in this area and they do not compare. Take it from myself with an Italian mother. This is the real thing."}
{"text":"Dated and expensive. There are much better places in the neighbourhood that do a much better job at a lower price point, with better ambiance and better quality.

I suspect this place has a long standing history and loyal regulars. I can see why - the food is good, but I think it's time for an update. I personally won't be coming back because I know some other spots very close by that fit my interpretation of value (quality, service, atmosphere) a little more ."}
{"text":"They don't have much taste in their dishes and the prices are the same as any other restaurant.  So it's best to spend your money elsewhere.  At least the service is fine."}
{"text":"I am huge fan of this restaurant. Although it is located in a strip mall on Hwy 7 which does not have a lot of character, I love the ambiance inside. The decor is clean and warm. The wait staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. 

Their grilled calamari is as good as it gets. Their Bistecca ZiZi at $18.95 (10 oz. sirloin. grilled, then sautéed in brandy and cream sauce) is delicious and a great value for the money. I usually get one of their specials. Their gnocchi with seafood in a rose sauce which is not on their menu but is usually served as a special is incredible. The portions are very generous, huge in fact, and the price is very reasonable for what you get. Last time I was there, I had the rainbow trout - also a special that day. The portion was enormous. I could barely eat half of it but it was very good. 

The only drawback with their menu is their desserts. I have tried them a few times but they taste store bought and are not that great. 

I would highly recommend this restaurant for authentic and reasonably priced Italian food."}
{"text":"The pasta was delicious, good selection of wine and the staff was really nice!
Would suggest to come here for date nights :)"}
{"text":"Had valentines dinner here last night. The service was okay considering they were really busy with all the vday-outgoers. I recommend the calamari for apps because they were simply perfect. Their gnocchi pasta with seafood was amazing. It was such a big portion that I even had the left overs for lunch today! Their veal dish looked good and was tasty according to my fiancée. And we topped it off with their tiramisu for dessert which was so light and rich at the same time. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Wow. Where do I begin? This is the first restaurant in the area that I sincerely feel could give Marcello's a run for their money. The interior is stunning; the stain and frosted glass windows let in just the perfect amount of light, illuminating the beautifully decorated interior. The employees are truly committed to the customer experience, they're attentive and well informed on their menu. The ingredients are fresh and hours later, I'm still thinking about our meal. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for our one month anniversary after hearing many great reviews from family and friends. He is Italian and I got to pick the restaurant so I wanted him to be impressed with the place because he has a higher standard for good Italian food.

We both loved it. He ordered some kind of seafood pasta and I tried my first muscle! The sauce was good but muscles are a weird texture :P

I ordered the veal marsala. I've only had chicken marsala before so veal was a nice change and it came with a generous portion of vegetables.

We also both got the house red wine which complimented the meal perfectly.

The service was great too.

Overall very impressed and would definitely return!"}
