{"text":"Not since when I was 14 years old I've been locked out of my house.  I've forgotten the keys and had to wait until my sister got home.  The heat was unbearable so I had to find foliage.  I had a choice between McDonald's and Seneca Pub, I really wanted a milk shake, however curiosity drove me through the large aluminium doors.  I descend down a flight of cornering stairs to the main floor, I immediately realise that this venue has not renovated from the business proceeded it.    One elevated leather sofa area, about three booth tables and three small high-rise tables behind the main dance floor. A huge projection screen showing sports, a couple chairs in front of a neon-lit bar--and that it.   The place doesn't have much to offer at all in terms of food, and even alcohol.  The basics are there, but clearly the venue is in it's infancy stages of becoming a local business.  Maybe like, research & development.  It is shabby and there's nothing here to do.  So it is completely perplexing that I found Seneca Pub to be a very pleasant place throw back a beer.  I came here alone and stayed for less than forty minutes, had one beer at the bar, watched soccer with the 6-7 peoples who were here, and occasionally talked to the owner.  It was the most relaxing time I've had at a bar this year!  I don't know what happened.  The owner was a nice guy who is pleasant to talk to, and gave me peanuts.  The last time I was offered free peanuts at a bar was my previous visit to the rooftop bar at the Park Hyatt.  These two venues are worlds apart. The menu consisted of some fries & chips, simple.  Sports food!  I wouldn't harp on them for this because I can't imagine anyone wanting to come here for a feast, not yet anyway.  The place needs a serious face lift.  These are all reasons I should find it to hate Seneca Pub, but I just don't.   Perhaps it's more of my primitive side which aroused my fondness for simplistic & kitsch establishments which holds neighbourly accents, but this place I can actually find myself coming again (in a t-shirt & cargo pants or something).  They have free salsa classes on Wednesdays, and according to the website the dance instructor is....boomchickbowowww..!  A LOT of potential if given the necessary aesthetics & proper promotion.  Welcoming in a humble way.  Very humble way..DJ on Fridays.  Yeah...salsa"}
{"text":"Yes, this place needs a serious face lift but the service was great and so was the food.  The washrooms were clean too!  I think we were greeted by the owner who was pleasant.  We had the a couple of the lamb skewers, nachos and wings and drinks... all good.  We will definitely will come here again...  Carmela"}
{"text":"Was there on June 20/18 under the new ownership of East Indian decent,  I was very impressed with the food and service from a pub style bar.. Greeted  very nicely and  the CSR was good as they made you comfortable.. Had the chicken wings and fries  with one downside,, The fries were excellent andthe wings were a bit overcoooked.. Mentioned to the owner and they promised to correct it. Wings tasted very good.. Fries were a bumb it ewqas for taste.. With pub style bristo and Indian flare of cooking,i was there today and tried the byrani rice with tandoori chicken and a knockout.. i called the owner to compliment him for the amazing dish i got.. Brought it home and enjoyed everybit of it.. The washrooms are very clean from a mans point of view.. Very spacious with pool tables , ping pong table and a dart board.. Large space for catering for large groups with a dance floor and do recommend for group gatherings.. Keep in mind there's video camera outddors for safe get together.. Overall I do rate this place as 4.5 on the ratings/"}
{"text":"Obviously a local water hole, this place is situated at Peanut Plaza which is the cutest name I've ever heard.    There is much left to be desired like the washrooms didn't even have soap..  but the single staff member was able to provide me with some hand sanitizer to compensate for that.    2 pool tables on site at 2 dollars per game.    This reminds me to the usual local bar but they should definitely look into the cleanliness factor not just for customers but employees working there.    For what it is I give 2 stars for friendly staff, cold beer and pool tables."}
{"text":"I will give it 5 starts because the owner is very friendly and welcoming. They have arcades, ping pong, pools and have karaoke nights. Go before 1am and get some cheap drinks w your friends!"}
