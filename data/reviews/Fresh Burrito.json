{"text":"Let me start off by saying my main burrito place is Burrito Boyz. I noticed this place had opened up right next to one of my regular spots, and figured, if they've got the balls to open right next to an established, big name place, they've got to be at least comparable, if not better. The last three times I wanted a burrito, I went here. I don't just try a place once and base my opinion on that one time. The first time I went, I was really impressed. The atmosphere here is slower and more laid back, compared to burrito boys, but still welcoming and comfortable nonetheless. I ordered a large steak and chicken burrito bowl (the equivalent to a Burrito Boyz large steak and chicken naked burrito). I was fairly impressed. The rice was slightly different, but great. The main toppings were pretty much the same, with the exception of their salsa. It was great as well, but less chunky. They also have three options for the salsa; sweet, mild and spicy. Their burrito and hot sauces are also different, and also great. I actually prefer this place's burrito sauce to Burrito Boyz. The major difference between the two places is the taste of the meat. Burrito Boyz chicken and steak meat tastes good, but compared to this place, is a lot less flavourful. This place's meat is juicier, and a lot more flavourful, which adds to the overall flavour of the burrito. My only complaint is the meat is served out of a warming dish, and isn't cooked basically right in front of you when you order it. Could be foodservice, or could've been made in house hours beforehand, or even the day before. That's my only complaint about the quality of the food. The portion size on that first trip was slightly smaller than Burrito Boyz. On the second and third trips however, the portion size was dramatically smaller. Not enough rice or meat. I asked for more rice and was reluctantly given more, but even then, it only covered half the container. The quality remains great though. I understand that this place is new, and they're still getting used to things and working out the kinks, but if they don't consistently match the portion size that Burrito Boyz does, I'll be switching back to them. If possible, I'll take pictures of both places large burrito bowls and post them for comparison. I recommend that everyone try this place at least twice. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"So this is a new burrito place on brampton.. they don't have a big parking lot so o suggest you park in the BEER STORE parking lot and walk a bit to the place.. and let me start by saying it is very brave and bold for them to open up right next to BURRITO BOYZ.. but aside from the location and parking let get to the juicy part their food...  So we ordered 3 items today off the menu..  I will start with the kids menu, I ordered the MINI QUESADILLA with chicken for my 5 year old son and wow they put so much cheese and the chicken wasn't spicy so that was a big plus for us and my son, you can also add veggies of your child likes tomatoes bell pepper and all but we stuck with chicken and cheese.. let me also say that the chicken was NOT dry it was very moist and full of flavor.. all kids meal come with a juice box (but they ran out of juice box today so we choose the canned ice tea) and it also comes with a cookie OR chips.. for kids the menu and flavor of food is very good for those little picky eaters..  Second item we got was the burrito of the week which was GROUND BEEF I choose a large since I shared with my hubby.. added the rice the 2 types of beans they have and with veggies got tomato lettuce corn black olives red onion cilantro and guacamole with if I'm correct is .75Cents extra and worth it I must say I choose medium heat and sour cream.. and boy this was a big burrito and all the ingredients were fresh and the salsa was amazing.. (they do have other sauces but I more of a sour cream and salsa girl.. ) beans and rice were very good and not hard or over cooked..  Last item we got was the fish taco(cone with 2 taco. If you want a thirst it will cost $2.00 for one more) in the soft shell.. my only con for this was that I think they should fry the f8sh instead of cooking it in a pan but it was still delicious and moist. My hubby add the same veggies but one taco had jalapenos and chipotle sour cream to kick up the heat..  For a new burrito place it is very clean and the ingredients look fresh so I hope they keep it up in that area.. I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends to try it out..  And all of this was under 30$ a b8g difference from when we order at other burrito place 2 items come  up  to $30plus.. So big thumbs up"}
{"text":"Ordered via Uber eats & purchased a Chicken and Steak Mix Burrito with hot wings on the side. Pretty standard burrito but packed full for goodness. Food arrived  warm so not sure if I would purchase from Fresh Burrito again..."}
{"text":"I don't particularly like the taste of burrito boys but go there bc of the price and veggies. THIS place Fresh Burrito however is delicious, huge portion, excellent service. The employees I dealt with were two Indian girls. Both very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu, which is not typical of Indian service.  I got the veggie soy burrito and will be coming back but this time for the tacos and their supreme fries."}
{"text":"This is my go to SkipTheDishes late night craving food haha. I tried the quesadilla and it was not amazing. I tried a burrito by accident because the delivery driver brought the wrong order. The burrito was okay, very meaty and saucy. My legit go to food is the nachos. The portion and price is excellent! The fries are good. The churros are good. The chicken wings.... the chipotle bbq is too tangy, as well as the lime tequila flavoured one. I recommend trying to serve honey garlic mixed with parmesan cheese flavoured wings :) I will always order because of nachos haha."}
