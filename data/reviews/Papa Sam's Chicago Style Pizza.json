{"text":"Giving 1 star is being generous. We have ordered from Papa Sam's a few times. The customer service is horrible but I could deal with it because the pizza and wings were somewhat decent until last Friday. The first time we ordered from here we could hear them talking in the back. They needed a delivery driver. Someone had \" he doesn't have a license.\" To which someone else replied (sounded like the older gentleman \" do you think I care?\" My husband and I just looked at each other like, are you kidding me??  Then they were out of Pepsi 2 liter. So they were giving customers 4 cans. Well, a 2 liter is certainly does not equal 4 cans. They should've given at least 5 but 6 to be nice and make up for it. Then a lady came in and they told her they were delivering her pizza. She paid for her pizza after stating her father is the only one home and has no money. Then the girl working there said can you call you Father and tell him to tell the driver that you paid for the pizza? Um, shouldn't YOU call YOUR driver and tell him?? So after waiting what seemed like forever we finally get our pizza. We were surprised it was really good. We seriously ordered there then next 2 weekends. So we've had papa sams three weeks in a row. I always noticed that I felt like I was being overcharged a little bit but never really said anything. That was until this past weekend. I placed an order. They told me it was $44 and some change. I asked 'how much was the tax?' They replied back \"$3.57\" I then said \" that can't be\" if my order is 19.99 + 5.99 + 5.99 there is no way my total can be $44. Shes like well this is what the computer says. I'm like OK I order something that was $20 dollars. then 6 x 2 is 12. 20+12 plus 3.57 doesn't equal 44 dollars. Where are you getting this extra money from? She couldn't figure it out so she put her manager on the phone. The ended up doing something and told me my new total was 34 dollars and some change and my order would be ready in 2- 25 minutes. So we get there 27 minutes after I placed my order and guess what we had to wait even longer for our \"pizza\" and I use that term loosely. We get home. Our order is WRONG!! Not only is it wrong it is burnt burnt burnt. I was so tempted to call and tell them but the stupidity that runs through that place frustrates me and so I decided not to call. We couldn't even eat half of the pizza because it was so burnt and hard. Sad they now lost a faithful, loyal customer.  We love Don's across the street but they are a little pricey so we would only eat there every once in a while. Guess we will now be eating there more frequently since  Papa Sams is now a complete joke of a pizza place. I can honestly not see them lasting long if they continue to run the place like it has been running."}
{"text":"I used to order from Papa Sam's all the time. The food has just gone downhill. First of all it took 1 hour and 15 minutes for the food to even get here tonight. I ordered a Fettuccine Alfredo and the sauce was so bland and gross; it tasted like it came out of a jar. Which is really disappointing considering that making alfredo sauce is not time consuming or rocket science. When I order food from a restaurant I expect the food to be made from scratch; I can nuke frozen food myself and I don't need to pay an arm and a leg for subpar pasta. The garlic bread was good, the tiramisu was frozen still, and every time I have ever ordered it it it always comes frozen. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Under New Ownership. Food is Awesome, Great Specials!  Friendly service. The pizza was fresh and Hot out of the oven. I can't wait to try more food items next time,  Highly recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"Awesome deal not awesome service. Every week I take advantage of their large one topping for $5.99. It is pretty good but time and time again their service is lacking. The poor kid at the register gets sworn at by the manager, you get told in correct pick up times, and delivery food services get first dibs. I couldn't even get acknowledged today when I was trying to buy a soda after I paid for my pizza. But I've learned my lesson from now on I'll spend my $5.99 on Digornio"}
{"text":"Honestly, I was really excited to try their menu, lots of items looked really good... but I was definitely pretty disappointed... first off, I started calling right after they opened, took 8 minutes for someone to answer... still excited at this point, ordered a meatball sandwich and a buffalo chicken sub. Got quoted at 35-45 minutes... got there and he had sold all his meatballs to another customer, who called in after me, so that was pretty dick... meatball sandwiches are dope!!! And on top of that, there were no onions on the Buffalo chicken sub, the tomatoes were like the ends where the stems were, and the chicken was cut up microwavable chicken tenders.... proooobably not gonna go back..."}
{"text":"the pizza was all right I tried thin and hand tossed I would say the thin is better I like pizza on the crisper side the dough had no real flavor on either it just tasted like flour the sauce was OK it was just missing something nothing pop out for the price it's 10X better then any little Cesar's or pizza patron the buy at the counter friendly a little dry thou so if your short on cash skip Cesar's and go to them you will need to wait there but hot and ready"}
{"text":"If I could rate a zero I would even for lack of effort to make things right . It's clearly an insult to food any place that has a menu that large stay away from a pizza place trying to cover to many areas of the fast food market where 90% of there inventory is probably frozen along with a hired kid slapping it together makes for a bad experience all together where there is absolutely no thought process just profit from the customer.  Places with smaller menus have more pride in what they deliver.  I ordered the spahgetti dinner that can with meat sauce and garlic bread plus a salad for 8$ not to bad okay . Plus fried mushrooms.  Wings . And pepperoni bread . As you can see in the picture of the spahgetti pictures tell all . The mushrooms where over cooked .  Wings where very small . And the bread product was cold and dry . Called to speak with the manager and he had nothing to say only that if I would like to reorder lol . Really I think not . Do yourself a favor and stay clear save your money for something else ."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 large, hand tossed pizzas. The crust had no flavor, it was chewy and it had very little cheese on them.  I ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce. Very little sauce (the pasta barely changed color) and it was so tasteless.  First and last time ordering there!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the Italian beef wasn't too bad but there's not much competition locally. The large pepperoni pizza only had a couple of slices of pepperoni on it and it was hard to find at that. Chuck E Cheese should watch out because they'll have some stiff competition with this cardboard this place serves.  The fries tasted stale, the wings tasted like they were frozen and when I got done placing my order they asked me if I would like marinara for my cheese bread and blue cheese for my wings but doesn't  mention that they're going to charge me for both and those sides weren't cheap either considering I just spent $40. I'll never go back, I was very disappointed in them but mostly in the shadiness of them not telling me they're going to charge me for things that they are offering.  They lost my trust."}
{"text":"We are very close to this location, so when we got a flyer we couldn't wait to try a new pizza place. This is how the phone call went: I told them I wanted a large pizza with whatever toppings and 20 wings.  \"Sorry, we don't have bone-in wings right now\" Alright, boneless is fine. Can I also get an Italian sub?  \"Sure, but we only have 8 inch right now\" what is the price on that?  \"I don't know, let me check\" (about 5 minutes later he comes back and forgot what we asked) \"it doesn't really matter, but all we have is ham.\"  You really don't have anything but continue to promote yourselves? Can't comment on the food because they didn't have any to serve!"}
{"text":"Customer service well should lack of customer service  is horrible.  This was our first and last visit here. I was asking the guy a few qwestions how there food. The guy got very defensive when I asked \"How do you make your philly cheese stakes.\" He looks at and said \"I can not tell you how we make our food if I did in would be out of a job.\" I started laughing and told him I meant what comes on it. Heme rudely tells me. We placed our order and waited wish I had left because This so called pizza reminds me of frozen pizza. I know it's not but it really lacked flavor. The toppings are very cheap the cheese tastes like is low quality lacks good flavor, the pepperoni is okay at best. The philly sucked bread was very dry I didn't care for the flavor of the meat. Only ate a few bites of that wasted a lot of money because only ate one slice of pizza left to go get real food ."}
{"text":"we have been a customer of Papa Sam's since it opened. it was OK for a \"Chicago\" pizza. we are from Chicago and know good Chicago food. The store closed suddenly, just a note on the door saying \"family issues\". Ok...we kept watching, and it suddenly re-opened. My husband went in to order a pizza and being consistent customers, were concerned, asked why they closed. He was told by the gentleman at the desk, \"don't ask, just place your order\". (RUDE}. So we have been ordering and all of a sudden, we called one night at 5:30 pm that they had no delivery that day and no ingredients to make us a pizza. OK...that can happen. We called again and were told that they had enough ingredients for the pizzas ordered and nothing else. (what)?????  Since then, every time we have called for a pizza we are told there are no ingredients, or they have run out...and we do not call late, we like to eat early. They treat customers this way, they will be out of business, and permanently. We are clearly being treated this way unpurpose because my husband asked questions about running out of supplies and how were they going to fill orders from 5 pm to close? so don't order from there because it is obvious they are \"picking and choosing\" who they fill orders for."}
{"text":"Ordered extra large classic Pizza with no onions.  Had to repeat the order a few times to whoever answered the phone.  Also ordered 6 honey hot traditional wings.  Order came like they said 30 minutes but when we opened the box it had onions.  Had to call back and they gave a free small classic Pizza with no onions this time. The wings were good. Had good meat on it unlike some other places where it was mostly bone.  The pizza hand tossed classic was good fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery last night and called and waited. Well they never showed up. I elected to pay cash and received an email stating \"they want to take care of something that was paid for\". Think outside the box. Whether I paid OR NOT, I should have gotten my order. As well, compensated in some way I have a broken leg and can't walk or drive. I received a confirmation that the received my order.¿ I had to check a star to go on or else there wouldn't be even half of one."}
{"text":"The good:  The thin crust pizza was pretty good. The wings were pretty good also. A little crunchier than most and that is how I like them. I got a hot sauce on them and it was pretty much like everyones else.   Close to our house. It was dinner time so we decided to try Papa Sam's. We went in and picked up a menu. Then it was about 5 minuets till someone came from the back to see if we wanted to order. We ordered and waited. Over this time several people came in to pick up and order. Everyone had the same wait till someone came out of the back.   Their food is not bad. The customer service was not good. It appears they need help as someone either needs to be at the counter or can see that someone is at the counter."}
