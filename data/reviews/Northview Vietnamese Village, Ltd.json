{"text":"I love this place and have been coming here for years with friends.
The decor is terrible and cheesy, the service is not great but OK, however the food is AWESOME. Unfortunately this location is moving way into the NE so I will have to make a special trip for my pork on vermicelli and spring rolls."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Vietnamese Village for over five years. My favorite dish is their #17, sate beef pho, the best pho that I have had anywhere.

The broth is what does it for me : thick, tasty, and HOT! The broth for most other pho dishes at other restaurants is thin and often not very tasty. This place knows their pho.

I can't comment on their other dishes as I always order their pho ... I just can't see myself passing on the pho by getting something else."}
{"text":"I'm starving... and so I resorted to order out... or rather, order in. I'm currently enjoying a #36 from Northview Vietnamese Village at the comfort of my desk. 

The nicely packaged order came with the rice vermicelli, charbroiled chicken and spring roll with a good mixture of basil, lettuce, bean sprouts, chopped green onion and peanuts and ofcourse, the mandatory fish sauce that makes it oh-so-good. I'm a little disappointed that the take out bag didn't have any of the signature vietnamese hot sauce, but it did have plenty of the fish sauce.

Flavour was on par with anywhere else you'd get a similar dish and for the price of $10, it's not the most expensive, but it's also not the best deal in the city.

Nothing too special about the take out food, but i did hear that the restaurant itself is quite nice. It's a little hidden in an industrial area of Calgary, so get out your GPS and go find it if you would like to give it a chance."}
{"text":"I have come to this place for many years and was a fan until recently.  It has always been more expensive than other vietnamese noodles places in town but I like their Sate Beef Noodle Soup... so whatever right?  However, they have drastically down sized their portions recently by using much smaller bowls.  The portion sizes now is about 30-40% less than before depending on which item you order.  Unless you are a kid, you will not be full if you only eat one entree item.   

I took a step back and look at the overall restaurant from scratch instead of blindly coming here just because we have done so in the past.  The food is acceptable... no complaints there, but the price they charge is in the order of $2-4 more than their competitors in the area... which is quite significant for an entree that's only around $10.  Their portion size is really small now as noted earlier.  Their service is quite frankly not that great and the decor looks dated.  All these factors combined do not justify the inflated prices and we have made the decision that we will not come here again."}
{"text":"Vietnamese Village is located off 65th avenue in the NE, right across from the Deerfoot Mall.  I work in the NE so whenever I'm craving Vietnamese, I normally hit up Basil but I've always wanted to try some place new.  I first heard about Vietnamese Village through a coworker.  He mentioned that they have some great satay pho.  He specifically said that the satay didn't leave the oil layer on top of the soup like some places do and the satay is 'real' satay and it tastes delicious.  I was intrigued so I decided to check this place out during one of my lunch breaks.

A small group of us went during the lunch hour which is typically from 12PM - 1PM.  VV has their own parking lot and it was quite busy during lunch.  We were able to find a parking spot and waited just a few minutes before we were seated.  I found the decor to be interesting and random.  Red, green, white decorations scattered throughout the restaurant, very unique and fun.  We were seated at a booth which was roomy and there are pictures of some menu items on the table under see through plastic so if you were having some trouble placing your order, you can look at the appetizing photos and make your decision from there!  There is also complimentary jasmine tea when you are seated.  Most of us went with the recommended beef satay pho (PH17).  For a lunch hour, our meal came out pretty fast!  Each of us had a bowl of pho and there was a side of bean sprouts, limes, chili peppers and mint leaves to share.  I piled some bean sprouts on, squirted a bit of lime juice and tore some mint leaves up for my soup.  I took a spoonful and it was heavenly!  The satay taste is not watery but is thick and full of flavor.  The green onions scattered throughout the pho and the bean sprouts you put on give it a nice crunchy texture.  The beef was nice while the noodles were cooked perfectly ... I ate/drank everything!!  

Overall, service was good, nothing spectacular...our waters were topped up but we were left alone most of our time...which can be nice as we're all just chatting away.  The pho was great!  This is now my go to place for beef satay pho, I just love it...it has to be the satay in the broth! Sooo tasty!! And the prices are reasonable, one bowl of pho, maybe share some spring/salad rolls and it should fill you up!  Vietnamese Village is the place to go if you are craving some tasty pho on these cold snowy days, it'll warm you right up and hit the spot!

ps. I rhymed a bit there at the end...not intentionally but it works....teehehe"}
