{"text":"Awesome Portuguese style chicken on real charcoal and fresh fries! 

It's perfect for the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very good quality for the price. The chicken sandwish is delicous and well spiced. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"We ordered the regular and spicy quarter chicken meals and were not disappointed. I will say that even the spicy chicken wasn't very spicy, so if you're looking for heat get the very spicy chicken. 

The portions here are huge, with our quarter chickens both seeming closer to half chicken meals. Both the chicken and the fries were well seasoned, and the salad was basic but fresh. The pastel de nata were delicious too, but how could they not be. 

While the food is great, it's the customer service that really sold us on this place. The guy who was working there prepared our food quickly and was very friendly. 

All in all, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Le poulet était super bon, les gars vraiment gentils. Allez l'essayer à 2 pas du métro."}
{"text":"We ordered the full chicken with comes with fries and salad; and we added some nata (dessert). 

The food was really good, it came it was still hot and was delivered within 15 minutes. The only thing is that there were only one sauce for a whole chicken and not enough dressing for the salad.

Other than that, it was really good!"}
{"text":"Monteiro may be a far cry from the legendary Mavi rotisserie that used to be at the same location; nevertheless, it still does a convincing job of Portuguese chicken.

It is one of two new Portuguese rotisseries that recently opened in this part of town.   Solely based on the chicken, I prefer this place to Piri Piri on Cote des Neiges.  The flavor of Monteiro's rotisserie chicken is more complex, and the hot sauce they use to mop the chicken with is far better.

I just wish the rotisserie chicken could be much smokier like what Mavi used to serve.

Portion sizes are huge, not just the chicken legs themselves, but the mountain of fries, rice and salad that are included as well.  The chicken leg dinner was already quite cheap, and for one dollar more you can add another chicken leg.

The french fries taste homemade, and are dusted with a nice light and tasty seasoning.

If you don't like chicken, you're out of luck since every dish on the menu contains chicken.  Maybe they will eventually add other traditional Portuguese dishes like chorizo, grilled seafood, etc.

The restaurant is newly renovated and clean, but its not huge inside, so it might not be ideal if you're a large group.

I will definitely be back, since it offers a really good value for the money."}
{"text":"Where do I begin? This place is overpriced for the quality and cheap on the quantity. I ordered a whole chicken and got MAYBE the equivalent of 1/3 of a chicken... Dried up to all h#ll as though they purposely inserted straws into said chicken and sucked out all the juices. The salad for $6.90 = 1/2 of an old rotten iceberg lettuce sprinkled with a few slices of tomato and cucumber. In addition, everything I ordered was actually available in a combo for less money, but I was charged a la carte and paid more for the same order. Conclusion: should have stuck with Romados (I am not I'm any way associated with Romados, just a devoted customer who accidentally went astray and learned her lesson)."}
{"text":"The Short: Outrageously over-priced and mediocre. 

The Long: Unless you're the local lunch crowd, this is a takeout experience since the interior only has a small counter with limited seating. Monteiro is relative new and has a fairly small menu with burgers, Portuguese chicken and a few baked desserts. There are a few pasta dishes but they're only served during winter.

Most combos come with fries and a small salad. The fries are seasoned before serving and of the \"home cut\" variety, we found them way too salty. The salad is nothing special, at all. 

The woodchip/charcoal grill is the feature here and the smell is noticeable as soon as you walk in. You can expect to find half a dozen chickens on the rotisserie at any given time.

The chicken comes in three varieties, mild, spicy and very spicy.

We tried the half-chicken combo and the burger combo. The burgers are 150g and thick. They have a nice variety of cheeses for the burgers, blue, brie, cheddar and Swiss.

In our case, the burger was undercooked and had a bright pink center -  always a scary affair. The fries had a burnt exterior and a raw interior. The salad was bland, wilted and barely edible.

As for the chicken, it wasn't anything exceptional and traditional Portuguese chicken is seasoned as it's cooked, not basted with a paint brush before serving. 

As for the prices, yes, it was stupid expensive. At over $30 for two combos (doesn't even include drinks) we expect to be impressed. 

We were far from it."}
{"text":"I ordered a bifana sandwich. It's the name for a Portuguese pork sandwich. I ended up with beef! Since it did not seem to be much seasoned, I asked for hot sauce. They charged me extra for it...
Then, by listening to the two employees talking, I understood that they were North African, because I have myself some North African beckground. In any case, I ate my sandwich and the small salad plus some of the fries of my combo. Then I was nauseated the whole day and also most of the next day, today... This Monteiro franchise is as Portuguese as I am a Martian. It's an unadvertised halal restaurant. 
Terrible experience!!! :("}
{"text":"Went again and ordered the same thing - whole chicken mild. It was still great. Others in my group ordered a half chicken meal and that looked good too. The fries were crispy which I like.  Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"It grows on you. They must put crack in the sauce because I'm hooked and I keep going back for more. I like their chicken sandwiches. They toast the bread on the grill, which gives it a nice crisp crust. Go for the spicy sauce. The combo comes with fries and salad, and it's pretty big. I find a sandwich is usually enough for lunch unless I'm particularly hungry. There's always soccer on the screens so you'll never miss a goal. Check the opening hours for Friday lunch, as they close for an hour in the early afternoon."}
{"text":"Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the prices to be so outrageous. It's 18,95$ for a whole chicken, fries and salad combo and 13,95$ for the chicken only. I personally enjoy their chicken. It might not be ''authentique'' Portuguese chicken but it's worth to give this place a try. Good for takeouts but there's actually a place to sit in the back of the restaurant, not just in front."}
{"text":"Lovely & clean, the location is very good, easy parking and tasty food . Their family platter which they claim to be good for 3 people is good for 4 and half people, their portions are very generous and their chicken is so tasty, well spiced and moist! The service is very fast ofc the chicken is made on charcoal so sometimes you might have to wait a little longer to ensure a good cooking! I will definately go back and their prices are very reasonable! Keep it up guys great chicken at a great price"}
{"text":"After getting home from work today, I decided to order from a restaurant that I had not tried yet due to the fact that they have Portugese chicken.. big mistake on my part. Ordering through Just-Eat, I was not aware of their incompetence just yet. An hour after ordering I received a phone call from the restaurant telling me that the food was almost ready and it would be another 30 minutes. 45 minutes later. I get another call telling it will be 15 minutes more. I had not yet searched the location of Monteiro, and as I did I realized that it was a 7 minute drive from where I am. It took this restaurant 2 hours to deliver to me. They are 7 minutes away. Awful service. And the food, honestly not so bad. Pretty plain, but not necessarily bad. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Mes collègues m'ont recommandé l'endroit mais malheureusement j'ai été très déçu. Mon poulet était cuit mais disons que j'aurais ajouté quelques minutes de cuisson, c'était très borderline. Beaucoup TROP de frites... et la salade? Un tas de salade en très grosses tranches (donc difficile à manger avec une fourchette, en une bouchée) avec une tomate, des oignons et beaucoup de vinaigrette. 10$ pour cette assiette. Autre le fait que la portion est généreuse, je n'ai pas aucun autre point positif. Le staff n'était pas très souriant non plus d'ailleurs. Je suis normalement une fan de la nourriture portugaises et ce diner était une grande déception.."}
{"text":"Une petit restaurant fast food tout neuf et propre.

J'ai commandé le sandwich Monteiro qui contient une bonne dose de poulet cuit sur charbons. Et ce poulet a vraiment du goût. Je pense que c'est le point fort de cet endroit. 

Par contre le pain pour les sandwich est vraiment cheap de chez et très sec. La laitue et autres légumes étaient tassés tout au fond de mon sandwich au même endroit. J'aurais préféré que le tout soit un peu mieux réparti et que le poulet soit plus chaud.

Face à tous les wraps au poulet des fast food libanais et marocains du coin, je préfère payer un wrap au poulet chez Al Amine juste à côté pour moins cher et je dirais selon mes goûts meilleurs dans l'ensemble.

En conclusion je pense que les sandwichs sont à éviter et qu'il vaut mieux passer aux plats directement."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some Portuguese chicken and decided to give this place a try. 
 
We had the food delivered and it was fairly quick.

We ordered chicken thighs, potatoes and 2 sandwiches( beef and chicken). 

The food smelled amazing and was hot, always pleasant when you order lol.

The seasoning of the chicken was good but I wouldn't call this authentic Portuguese chicken. However it tasted better than the other Portuguese restaurant in the neighborhood..

The sandwiches were...okay. The bread got all mushy from the sauce, expected with delivery so This will not affect my rating. The sauce was good but there was something missing.

Overall it was ok."}
