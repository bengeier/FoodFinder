{"text":"I never thought i would say this about really any restaurant, but We Will not be going back to Jc's. Horriable! Horriable!
We ordered,the 32oz , my husband & i, got everything set, and when the dinner actually showed up, it wasnt cooked AT ALL to what we ordered.
Sent it back ( total mistake), the manager threw it on our table,never said Sorry \" OUR MISTAKE\" instead she said,\" Here you go,we even put on new plates\" and walked off.
Meat was worst the 2nd time around!!!
Received bill ( 94.00$)
No discount, nothing!....for a mistake They made!...
We could of made soo many other choices that night, but we didn't. 
$94.00 out the window, but trust me we will never will make that mistake again!"}
{"text":"2nd Attempt - Our first attempt was the first night they opened...so understandable that it wasn't the best experience. My family ate here a week ago. It was a Friday night, busy, but not horrible. We were greeted and seated right away. It was at least 15 minutes before the server (a male, didn't get his name) came and took our drink orders, then it was another 15 minutes before our drinks began to arrive at the table! They arrived one at a time. We tried to order beer but were told they didn't have any because the cooler was broke. My husband ordered a margarita, which arrived first..then my son's sprite came out about 6 minutes later. My bloody mary?? 23 minutes after I ordered! 
The Food - my husband ordered the prime rib sandwich, I ordered the Steak Diane burger and my son had chicken. All of the food was delicious and prepared perfectly. I've been craving the Steak Diane burger since that night. The presentation of the food was beautiful and we'd all order the same meals again. 
We used to be regulars at the owner's previous spot and want to support a local restaurant. The food is worth going back for. The only reason I'm not rating 5 stars is for lack of service. Once the server dropped off our drinks, he didn't return to our table until 1 hour and 16 minutes later to drop off the check. We had to ask two others that were working that night for more water and sprite. We will definitely be back...but will be hopeful our server will be better prepared."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant for the first time last night. Service was less than okay. Waiter recommended a cocktail with lemonade, vodka and basil. 15 minutes later he returns to tell me they are out of basil. So I order a martini. Another 15 min later I finally get a drink. My husband orders a bowl of soup it is served with no spoon. My salad is served with no dressing. Which I asked for some and they never brought it. Finally 1 hour later our dinners arrive. Our steak dinners come with no steak knifes and no butter for my cold potato. Everyone seems very rushed buzzing around like bees. Made you feel you were bothering them. The only thing nice I have to say is the steak was cooked perfect and was delicious. Not enough for us to return. I can go to many other steak houses and get a good steak with good service. $147.00 later we left very disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, I try and support local business and I don't mind paying for a good meal. What a joke. The scallops were the size of nickels, the halibut was maybe 2\"X2\". The potato's were cold, the prime rib overcooked and the prices through the roof. Don't waste your time. Try the DC Steakhouse instead."}
{"text":"A very sad experience.  We went for our 30th wedding anniversary.  The waiter, a nice young boy, did not have any other customers, so he SAT AT OUR TABLE and told us all about his life.  
Drinks took forever.  Food took forever.  They forgot to add taste to the food, and the steaks were cold.  There were no other parties in the restaurant (which is telling for a Saturday evening) so how could this be so bad?  
While we barely had ten minutes alone for the entire meal, we pleasantly paid the bill that was just shy of $150, before the tip.  Although we were pleased to see a steakhouse open in our neighborhood, and although we always give a new place three tries before voting it off the island, we won't be back.  This was possibly the worst dining experience we've ever had."}
{"text":"Not sure where the other folks who took the time to review JC's were eating. Safe to say they were not at JC's. The space itself is awesome. Excellent bar, great beer selection, top shelf liquors. Staff was very attentive. The NY strip was perfectly cooked as were the sides. JC's is well worth the trip and way better than any out of state chain."}
{"text":"We went to JC's Steakhouse at 6 pm on a Saturday night. We were seated right away. That should have been our first clue.  This place really wants to be a high end steakhouse but comes up short.  The decor is a confusing mix of country and industrial. We tried a variety of foods and were disappointed in almost everything.  The clam chowder was thick and pasty, the grilled shrimp was bland, the crab cakes were laced with spicy jalapeños (server did not inform us), and the service was terrible.  They were very understaffed. We had to repeatedly flag someone down to ask for things such as appetizer plates, drink refills, and silverware.  You can not charge what you are charging and treat guests this way. I have had better service at The breakfast place down the street."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Friendly service. Excellent seasonings on steaks. We tried sirloin and filet mignon. Only criticism is that their clam chowder had a good creamy base but not enough flavor or seasonings. We definitely will be back for the steaks!"}
{"text":"Great date night! My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for a few months and finally got a chance... Not what I expected.. We walk in and immediately welcomed and we choose to sit in the bar area. I was anxious to hear live music! 
We ordered a extra dirty martini and captain and coke, which the martini was AMAZING! 
Our food was great, we got the Gilbert cut and filet, great choices. 
The music just made the whole night!! I loved that I could sing along and still have a conversation with my husband. 
So glad we decided to go!"}
{"text":"We went to the French wine and dinner last night.  The Chef and owner of JC's  Dennis out did himself. His wife is so accommodating they both show they love their restaurant and give 110% of themselves. We will be back, next dinner and pairing will be with Beer. you meet new people and taste 4 course dinner and pairing of 4wines or beers depending on what the Chef creates, great concept! It is a set dinner and wine or beer. I don't know how they can do such a great job and charge such a reasonable price for a great evening. Because he is making every course fresh, it is an experience, not a fast dine and run.  Stay have enjoy."}
{"text":"The Salmon entrée was excellent! Fabulous desserts and attentive service. Will go back again!!"}
{"text":"WOW JUST WOW THIS PLACE IS SO BAD! My wife and I couldn't remember a time we've been to a restaurant this bad. 

First our server Brittney was so annoying and awful, you would ask her a question about how something is on the menu and she would just tell you what was on it which you can read on the menu. \"Brittney how is the beef stroganoff?\" \"it's noodles with mushrooms, meat, brown gravy with sour cream added\" and there what much more I don't get into.

Tried to order the Artichoke Dip for a starter...Brittney comes back and tells us they are out of it. I ask how the sautéed mushroom starter is \"it's mushrooms with cracked pepper on it, very peppery\" needless to say we decided not to get a starter. after the great description of the beef stroganoff I asked can my wife get a little taster of the sauce to make sure she likes it...server returns from the kitchen and say's she can't provide a taste of the sauce. At this point I'm ready to walk out without even tasting the food yet. My wife is pregnant about to pop at any minute so she just ordered the meatloaf and we decided to stay and hope at least the food would be better than the service. I ordered the prime rib cooked rare since I figured it would come out overcooked. 

fist they brought me clam chowder which I took two bites of and sent back, it was the worst clam chowder I've ever had. Then I got a caesar salad which was the highlight or this nasty meal. The meatloaf came out which looked really good but once my wife cut into it she realized it was raw in the middle...remember she is prego raw meat isn't good for babies, she tried to eat around the more cooked edges which made it look like dog food. My prime rib was the 2nd to worst I've ever tasted. It tasted like it had no seasoning on it very bland and the outside was dry and over cooked and the middle looked pink but was tough and had lots of fat, they didn't serve it with au jus they just had it poured over the top but it looked and tasted like they just poured oil on it, was just the grease from the prime rib. My wife and I just laughed at how bad everything was, I don't think I've ever just sat there and laughed at how bad everything was. When the server picked up our plates they were still full of food I didn't even eat but maybe 2oz of my 10oz prime rib and my wife's plate was full of a heaping pile of what looked like dog food. You think the server would ask if everything was ok but she must know how bad the food is. I kept turning my plate in hopes of finding something I would like on my plate but the smashed cauliflower and sautéed veggies were both awful as well. 

After paying $45 for our two nasty meals we went to Freddy's steakburger and got burgers and shakes to try to get the taste of that horrible food out of our mouths.

I wish I was exaggerating in this review but sadly I am not. We will never be back there again and I hope you don't ruin your date night visiting this place either."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time. Inside is nice and simple. Food was excellent. Had NY Steak with shrimp. Steak was cooked to perfection  medium rare. Service was excellent as well. Will put this place on our list of places to eat."}
{"text":"Wife and I decided to give a local steak house a try and chose JC's since it was just down the road from us. We had read reviews on Yelp and Google and they were a mixed bag. I take reviews with a grain of salt and also those that have not checked in I am very skeptical of.

Anyways, we went this past Saturday evening about 7pm and there was no wait at all. Sat right down and we were greeted by Levi asking what we would like to drink. Kilt Lifter and the Mint Lemonade. We decided on the Spinach artichoke dip which was good, was a little thin but thickened up as it cooled off. Wife opt'd for a dinner salad and I did the Clam Chowder, I should have gotten a whole bowl instead of a cup, was very good.

So on to the entree, wife ordered the Prime Rib Gilbert cut with mashed cauliflower and I got the Steak Oscar with baked potato and veggies. Wife enjoyed her prime rid and I loved the Steak Oscar, it was cooked to a perfect medium, was tender and juicy. Add the crab and Bearnaise, mmm yum! The veggie mix was ok, I would have preferred an option broccoli instead. Everything was served hot and fresh. Only down side is it was somewhat chilly inside which in turn caused the food to cool quicker than expected, maybe turn up the thermostat some for the winter months.

For desert we ordered the Pineapple Creme Brulee, I was skeptical on the combination of such, i was the chocolate cake, but wife wanted the Brulee. It was surprisingly good and was not over powered with pineapple like I expected.

A couple of thoughts for the ambiance, maybe replaced the commercially labeled salt and pepper shakers with something more suited to the atmosphere. Also maybe some nice work flooring in the dining area might give the area a more warm feel and help keep down the coolness of the concrete. Lighting was not bad, but maybe something a little dinner to set the mood and something more centered over the booth tables.

Overall this was a good dining experience and will be going back for sure. :)"}
{"text":"nice waitress but that was the extent.  over priced, bad food, bad music,ran out and puked the artichoke dip...next time...i will walk ouutside and throw 150 bucks in the street"}
{"text":"Oh my...great date night choice. Great food awesome atmosphere. Just riding by and decided to stop. This was a great choice. Live music on Friday and Saturday 7-10.  Met the owner/chef Dennis. Awesome dessert also!!! Must come enjoy for yourself."}
{"text":"I had the lamb chops and they were amazing! Server was very attentive and courteous. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My wife, a friend of ours visiting from California, and I had dinner at JC's Steakhouse last night. It was our first visit. As my wife and I drove by JC's today on our way to an appointment, we talked about our dining experience. 

The good: The hostess was terrific, both on our way in and on our way out. A good start and, thankfully, a good finish. The menu, both in design and content, shows some personality. Of course our server recommended steak, and we all decided that we would do that.

My friend and I both ordered the wedge salad, and it was excellent in all respects. My wife had the dinner salad, which she reported as good though apparently not as good as ours. 

The steaks arrived too soon (see below), and when we tasted them all of us liked the flavor very much. Our friend is more of a foodie than either of us, and he commented several times on the excellent flavor of the meat.

The bad: The wedge salad is not a direct substitute for the dinner salad, and in fact is a larger serving than the dinner salad. Perhaps that was why neither my friend nor I were finished with our salads when the main course arrived at our table.

Yes, prompt service is generally a good thing. This was bad for three reasons. First, the dishes were all fairly large and there simply was not enough room on the table for three salad plates, three dinner plates, six glasses, a basket of bread, etc. Second, maneuvering plates around without getting in each other's way pushed my salad enough to one side that it was harder to reach and less enjoyable of a dining experience. Third, and most problematic, our main dishes sat on the table for several minutes before we could get to them, and all of our sides (we all ordered the mashed cauliflower) were basically cold when we were ready for them.

All of that would have been avoided by a more attentive server, who would have cleared the salad plates before bringing the entrees. We all liked the mashed cauliflower, but would much rather have had it (and the green beans) warm.

But by far the biggest issue of the evening was the meat, which was inferior in every way except for the flavor.

We ordered three different cuts cooked two ways. A top sirloin medium rare, a ribeye medium rare, and a filet cooked medium. A filet is generally a better cut than a ribeye, which is a better cut than a top sirloin. Not ours.

In fact all of our steaks were made from very poor pieces of meat. The top sirloin was actually the best cut of the three, and the ribeye, which was supposed to be 10 oz. (bone-out), yielded perhaps 5 oz. of edible meat. Even the filet was not completely edible because of fat.

Additionally, both the ribeye and the top sirloin were cooked unevenly. They were supposed to be medium rare, but each had one end that was rare, and had it not been for the sear could have been used for steak tartare. We discussed this for several minutes at the table and perhaps should have called it to the attention of the hostess. Our server seemed not to notice that we were all sending back plates with large pieces of undercooked bad meat.

As we talked today we wondered if we would return to JC's, and we decided that we would give it some time before returning. The experience was not bad, the wedge salad was very good, the sides might have been good, but the beef was a fail, even with the great flavor.

And that just won't do for a place with \"steakhouse\" in the name."}
{"text":"Been here three times.  Excellent service the first time, second time was good, but our last visit was not good. Most recently food was just OK, and the service was poor.  Drinks were not refilled, items were missing from our order, and when we inquired with our server there was not so much as a 'sorry'.  Likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Finally!! A STEAKHOUSE in Gilbert that has wonderful service, atmosphere  and the food is fantastic !!"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. Atmosphere seems pretty cool. Industrial like with a modern flair. Wife and I were excited to try this place. Walked in and was hit with a ton of smoke. The whole dinning area filled with smoke. Not sure if it was supposed to be this way or something \"happened\". Looked past this and decided to sit a high top in the bar area. Our waitress was great and took care of our drink needs promptly. Order an appetizer and our dinner about 7:15. App came out and so do our salads about 10 minutes later. Wedge salad didn't come with dressing, but I looked past that as well and our waitress got me dressing promptly. We ordered the pork skins and they were pretty damn good as well. This is where it all the goodness ends. 8:30 rolls around and we have no steaks? No dinner to be had. Asked for our bill as we had to be somewhere by 9. Waitress was very apologetic for what happened. However no manager came out to apologize or anything. What happened to our order? I just wanted to know what was going on. Anyways ended up wasting almost 2 hours and no dinner. Highly disappointed with the experience. I was hoping we had a local gem here in Gilbert. Hopefully this is only because they are new."}
{"text":"The wife and I were excited to have a new restaurant open so close and we visited a couple weeks after they opened. The decor is very nice and overall it's a good atmosphere except for the smoke coming from the kitchen. It remains need me of an episode of bar rescue that I had watched.

Overall the steaks were very bland and had very little taste. I ordered the ribeyes and my wife ordered a cut with crab on top that sounded wonderful but ended up being very disappointing. We are both very experienced steak eaters and we both agreed these were some of the least flavorful steaks we had ever had. We both normally go medium rare and the steaks did come out cooked properly.

The shrimp cocktail was really good and priced well. The side veggies with my steak were good. The side mashed potatoes were served on the cold side.  We were both really glad that my wife steak came with hollandaise sauce to actually give out steaks from flavor.
The food did also take a while to come.out.  Overall we were very disappointed. We both agreed a place like Texas roadhouse would be a much better place to get a steak.   We do plan on going again in 6 months to see if they have improved but both of us left very disappointed and not eager at all to go back."}
{"text":"Strange place. Very dark where we sat. Could barely see my food. And it was just okay. The steak Diana burger was very salty and was OVERLOADED with the sauce. Which made the pretzel bun a hot soggy mess. I felt like I was eating sauce with a burger. Not a burger with sauce. The waitress never check on us after our meal arrived. Husbands prime rib was nothing to write home about. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Gilbert! I stumbled across this place via Yelp one night and thought I would give it a try since it's right by my house, couldn't be worse than the Mexican food joint that was there before (no offense), and, worse case scenario, could busy myself on the iPhone (as us singles usually do while dining alone). However, little did I know that I would walk into my soon-to-be favorite local restaurant. The bar area is great, especially for single diners. In fact, there are so many single diners (compared to the usual scene), that I not only felt comfortable dining alone, but after 15 minutes, I was dining with and getting to know everyone else at the bar. The only time I pulled out my iPhone was to share photos with other patrons, talking about similar trips we had taken. Not only are the bar and wait staff excellent, but so is everyone else dining there; what a local restaurant should be. One night the bartender was the co-owner and another, Nick. Both were great and made me feel welcome. Their passion and belief in the restaurant and food was incredible and made me want to go back, just to say \"hi.\"

Awesome vibe aside, let's talk about the food. On both occasions, I've had the filet. Grilled to absolute perfection. It had a nice \"crust\" on the outside while medium rare on the inside. Wish I could do that at home! I don't know anywhere you can go to get that quality of steak for such a reasonable price. The clam chowder is amazing (and yes, served with crackers now). The downside is I love my go-to order so much now, that I don't want to try anything else. 

I recently had family in town and they asked where we should go for a nice dinner nearby, this was the first on my list, surpassing the downtown Gilbert trend thing going on right now (which is also great, but not if you want to eat right away without a huge wait and actually talk to other people). This place is such a gem that after 15 minutes of sitting in this restaurant, my guests agreed this was a great spot. However, after eating the prime rib, they insisted they come here with every trip to Gilbert.

In sum, not only is the food great, but so are the people that work and dine at this place. It's now a staple."}
{"text":"This is a new place in Gilbert and we were looking forward to trying it.  They were open for 3 weeks whenwe decided to give it a try.  This was a big mistake.  

We went to JC'S with a group of 5.  When we entered the decor was simple but seemed ok.  We were seated in the front near the fire place and we were excited.  However after a short time we found the even with the fire the was cold.  As this was our first visit we each ordered something different.  I had the lamb chops.  I asked the waitress how many chops were in the order.  She said I am not sure, 3 or 5, they are not separate they come as a rack.  When they came there were 4 all cut separate.  I asked for med rare they came med well. I also ordered French Onion soup.  The cheese on top was a Craft Single not even melted.  My wife ordered Prime Rib med rare. It came med well.  She also had a baked potato that was cold enough to have come directly from the refrigerator.  My son also recited a baked potato that was just as cold.  He ordered the sirloin med rear and it came med rear.  My daughter in law ordered scallops.  A couple were done and a couple of the scallops were half cooked. 

Now for the service.  The waitress was pleasant but not trained at all.  She could not answer any questions about the menu.  I finished my dinner first.  My wife was about 1/3rd finished.  My daughter in law and son were half done.  The waitress came over and took my plate asked the table if we were going to have desert. I was the only one done.  She promptly brought the check.  She was so quick that my wife had finished two more bites.  The place was not busy!!  I don't think she was trying to get rid of us just not trained.

We are going to avoid this please in the future."}
{"text":"My husband I have been to JC's twice in a week now. We kept driving by for months saying we should check it out, and finally did it. We shouldn't have waited so long. Both times we sat in the bar for the live music. 

The first time we went we had dinner. I ordered prime rib and my hubby had the steak Oscar. Both were delicious and cooked perfectly. It was probably the most flavorful prime rib I've had at a restaurant. We skipped appetizers and had dessert instead.  The bananas foster was delicious!  I love a classic martini with a steak dinner, but lots of restaurants don't mix them very well...not the case here. My martini was perfect...and it wasn't $12 like they are at most places.  The entire menu is actually very reasonably priced.  We've paid way more for lesser meals elsewhere. 

The second time we went just to have some cocktails and listen to the band. I ordered a martini and my hubby had a Manhattan....again, both mixed very well. 

The service here is exceptional - very friendly and attentive. The live music in the bar has been great and we have thoroughly enjoyed ourselves both times.

We think we will be making the bar at JC's our new Friday night hangout. The vibe is great, the food and drinks are delicious, and the service is fabulous. We were also told by our waiter that as many ingredients as possible are sourced locally - so it's just one more reason to love JC's."}
{"text":"Where to start? HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! Believe all the bad reviews on this place!!!!  It was such a disappointment, living so close and anticipating the opening we had really really hoped for good things. Not to be. Let's start with the salads....I ordered a ceasar which came out with cucumbers and tomatoes.What true ceasar is served with those? No parmesan. Obviously the only difference in their salads are the dressing. I bit into a tomato that was rancid and tasted like a rotting dead fish, so stopped there with the salad. The rolls were cold, stale and tasted like they were bought days old to begin with. One of our dining companions ordered blue cheese which he described as very weird tasting and not at all good. The main entrees came....again huge disappointments. The \"Large\" scallops are very tiny, the size of quarters and were so badly overcooked you could not even chew them. When I told the waiter and asked if he would tell the chef/owner, he so no. He was afraid he would lose his job. While we were there someone sent back their salmon, the owner looked  very angry when he was told. We felt bad for the waiter who had to bring it back there. Kitchen Nightmares would be good for this restaurant, maybe Gordon Ramsey could help.Then again, maybe not. Another one of our dining companions ordered the Jumbo Shrimp. When they came they looked like ithey were simply cooked shrimp cocktail shrimp had just been warmed up in a pan.... she said that is exactly how they tasted too and were not even warm when served. The vegetables were also on the cold side. The baked potatoes were small but  good.  They messed up to orders with the right kind of potatoes ordered and just couldn't seem to get it right so we just settled for what we had.  The NY strip steak was just ok, cooked as ordered but not great simply ok. The waiter was very friendly and tried his best but wasn't trained well and we just felt bad that he had to work at a restaurant with such terrible food. Gordon Ramsey would have a field day here."}
{"text":"Great prime rib and I had the Mahi Mahi.  Super service, and wonderful music in the bar for an after dinner drink"}
{"text":"Prime rib met my expectations and service is friendly.  They have a bar area to eat at if you are feeling social or a dining room with very comfortable booths if you feel like relaxing.  Great place to go during the week if you want to have a relaxing dinner with someone.  I could see taking the kids to bounceu Saturday night with parents night out and then having dinner at JCs to relax.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Wow, what an excellent restaurant. It is a Well hidden gem. Chef Dennis of radio and TV fame really has an outstanding menu of steaks, seafood and more.
The Steak Diane was as good as any I have ever had. The Filet was as good as any my wife has had.
Prices are moderate.
You would have to go to Scottsdale to find food that would compete with  jC's.
The ambiance is plain and below the quality of the food...but do not let that stop you. This place is the best in Chandler/Gilbert area for Steak and seafood.
We will come back often."}
{"text":"What a great place with delicious food and generous portions that are reasonably priced!!  We had the prime rib, sirloin steak , meatloaf and beef stroganoff and all were great! Will come again!"}
{"text":"I wanted to take a minute to share our positive experiences at JC's Steakhouse as I feel they've received some unfair reviews following their opening week. The service is now on point and the vents are now working; no smoke was seen in the dining room whatsoever last night. We spoke to the owner and he said they identified and resolved the issue. We've been twice now, the food was amazing both times. We were with friends last night and they too had a great experience and will return. We started with the delish smoked trout and lobster dip; unique but amazing with the large perfectly seasoned chunks of smoked trout and lobster. The Asian chicken wings were on point with a sweet and spicy sauce and a housemade chili dipping sauce; yum! Also, the wings were huge, I've never seen anything like it. The French onion soup was one of the best I've had. For the main entree I previously had the halibut with their special Olympia sauce which is similar to a heightened version of tartar sauce, cooked perfectly, not dry as Halibut tends to be. My friend had the seared scallops which was prepared perfectly, I had the mahi mahi with a blueberry sweet chili sauce. I could eat the sauce alone but it was a match made in my foodie heaven; I loved the sweet but spicy undertones! The men both had steak: the filet and steak Diana. Again, cooked just as they ordered it. The steak Diana had a black pepper mushroom sauce which my husband thoroughly enjoyed and he's a picky eater. The mashed cauliflower is something we don't see at many restaurants and we eat out often; just another example of the pride that the owners take in raising the level of their patrons dining experience. For dessert we had a chocolate molten raspberry dish, creamy in the center with a light raspberry sauce; fabulous! The decor is very appealing as well. Give this family owned restaurant a chance, the opening service and smoke kinks have been worked out and the food is top notch!"}
{"text":"For what I expected, this place went above and beyond. Came here Christmas Eve so I already expected crowds and probably a lack of service due to that, but I found the opposite. Here's a few Pro's and Cons.

Pro: 1. Great mom and pop style service, they feel warm and welcoming and are ready to serve without hesitation.
2. Management seems on top of it and double check that your service/food is great.
3. Never had an empty glass.
4. Steaks are OUTSTANDING! Unlike chain restaurants, the meat seems high quality and very well cooked. Top Sirloin was my favorite and had the tenderness of a filet with great taste (I begged for the recipe of the beer butter they put in it)
5. Good amount of options, not just steaks, and menu is well organized.
6. Did I forget to mention that the steaks were GREAT? I would go here over the Keg.

Now to the cons, while this place is impressive, here's a few side notes:
1. Atmosphere feels.. Cheap. While yes you're there for the food, I think some warmer colors will make it more comfortable. 
2. May need a flashlight to see menus, I have good eyes but family members reached for their phones. 
3. This is Arizona so I can't expect the best and most fresh seafood like the meats, but crab was a wee bit fishy (fresh usually doesn't have any of that taste to it). 
4. For a table of 5, took a lengthy amount of time to get the main entree. However, I would wait twice that for the good tasting food!
5. On crowded nights, gets a bit noisy!

So over all I will be returning here and making it my new choice steakhouse. I'm very curious how the filets are since the sirloin was as tender as a filet from the Keg. Texas Roadhouse doesn't stand a chance (too salty) and the price point makes it better than higher end steakhouses. 5 star and I'll update next meal I try."}
{"text":"First I wanted so badly for JC's  to be great. Came in at 7:30 on a Friday. There was no wait and front of the house was friendly. The booth was comfortable and the decor was nice.

We ordered calamari and it was excellent. I would order that panko yumminess again.  The bread came out and it was cold, like it came from a fridge. Not every good. Then our meal came out my wife ordered halibut $30. It was thin and way over cooked. I ordered a 12 oz ribeye medium and it came out almost blue. Not to mention I order a baked potato and the got them switched on the wrong plates. Finally we looked for redemption in desert. That didn't happen, creme brûlée not set and a plain carrot cake. Sorry JC's not a meal to make me come back. The server was good but the food did not back it up."}
{"text":"My Husband and I went there last night as a post Valentines Day dinner. I was so hoping it was going to be amazing, because I really want them to succeed. Atmosphere very cool, staff very friendly. Although we were never asked how our meal was. I would of been honest and told them my Halibut was over cooked and very thin!! Not worth $30. My Husband had top sirloin  which seemed to be ok. The food was very bland, in fact we had to add salt and pepper to everything. Never had to do that before in a fine dining restaurant. Also, I would suggest they have some music playing and serve some sort of bread with dinner. First impressions are so important.... It doesn't make me want to go back unfortunately. I hope the owners read these reviews and really take it into consideration to improve. They need help..Call in Chef Gordon Ramsey!!!"}
{"text":"First of all, I wanted to say we really wanted to like this place!! My husband and I rarely get out, so we were so excited to try JC's! We loved the location and the fact it was dark and live music was playing. So we were happy about the ambiance and the tone that was setting our night out, but sadly it was pretty disappointing from there!

First we ordered the trout and lobster dip as an appetizer and it was well... absolutely awful. It was extremely dry and the smokey taste was so overwhelming that it tasted like cigarettes and cat food combined. So we ordered the sautéed mushrooms thinking that we may have better luck. They came in a bowl with some onions and it was cold and tasteless. The garlic toast that came out with it, wasn't too bad. But we weren't sure what to do with it. Dip it in the bowl of mushrooms? Put the mushrooms and onions on top? 

For our entrée we got the porterhouse steak and lamp chops, both with mashed cauliflower and veggies. The porterhouse was ordered medium-rare, but was cooked medium-well done. It was relatively tender considering, but was just bland. The lamp chops were actually pretty good (yay!) but the sides were so bland and disappointing. We love mashed cauliflower and make it all the time at home, but JC's was very tasteless. We could've made the mashed cauliflower and veggies better at home. 

I cannot tell you how badly we wanted to like JC's Steakhouse. We rarely get a night out without the kids so it just stinks that it was a disappointing night. :("}
{"text":"My husband and I had our wedding reception here a few weeks ago and it was perfection !!! The staff were so helpful setting up everything and making sure all of our guests were comfortable ! Love the ambiance and decor. Dennis and Dianne were a delight to work with and catered to my every whim. All of my guests raved about the food and desserts . I can't thank them enough for making my big day so special."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse around I drive from North Phoenix just to eat there because they have the best prime rib"}
{"text":"Filet medallion was so so, salad was awesome but not enough ranch dressing, so we asked for more and got charged 70cents! I know that's not much but come on people.  Our server Gail was great and offered to pay for this herself.  Bless her heart.  The mac n cheese with reindeer sausage was really good.  However my husband didn't care for the sausage.  I loved it!  Drinks were really good.  With all the choices there in Gilbert AZ we won't be back.  Sorry JC's Steakhouse."}
{"text":"We had been wanting to try this place for awhile and opted it over The Keg because we know how crazy San Tan is on a Friday. We enjoyed this place. It has a good atmosphere and our food was delicious. There are several different meal and drink options on the menu. The only downside was the service was a little bit slow, but our server and the hosts were friendly. It's a great option for dinner and you get to support a locally owned place."}
{"text":"We usually get the Prime Rib sandwich and impressed with it. Last night we ordered the French onion soup and meatloaf and was disappointed how salty it was. Didn't feel good the rest of the night. I don't think I'll be back for awhile. To me that's poor form by the chef"}
{"text":"We were hoping to support a new local restaurant and made arrangements to meet friends at JC's at 6PM last Saturday night. Unfortunately, we were turned away at the door, along with others, because the entire restaurant was rented out for a wedding.
I'm sure they did a good business last night, but they didn't win any new customers here.  It would have been good form to apologize for the inconvenience and provide a discount for a future visit.  Unfortunately, we were simply turned away.  So, we spent 45 minutes waiting at Famous Dave's BBQ, but at least we eventually got a good meal.
I would recommend that you call ahead of time to confirm that JC's is actually open when they say they're going to be open."}
{"text":"Great Friday night dinner! I had the 6oz filet which was perfect. Waitress seemed really new but was good. Awesome local place to eat with a good atmosphere."}
{"text":"We've been several times now and usually get a steak. It has been consistently very good with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Texas Roadhouse on Friday night with a friend to get a nice steak meal.  The place had a 45+ minute wait so we looked up another steak house nearby and found this place which showed 4 stars on Google. Got there and it was not very busy but seemed like a nice \"rustic\" place to relax and have a nice meal.  I only eat the filet mignon and am very picky about the quality of this steak.  The waiter assured me it would be the best although he mentions it was the best \"choice\" filet in Phoenix.  My friend ordered the beef stroganoff which the waiter said was made with prime rib cuts.

My steak was the WORST I have ever had.  The taste wasn't too bad since it was definitely seasoned with quite a few herbs and other things.  The texture was more like a chuck steak and it had quite a bit of gristle throughout.  My friend said her's tasted like the meat had been frozen and had lke a \"freezer burn\" taste.  Since it was close to closing time, I told the waiter about the steak but did not want another one.  Write this place OFF."}
{"text":"Wish I could give 0/5. Went there this past weekend and was underwhelmed at best. Food was undercooked and extremely overpriced. My guess is because they aren't very busy from what I could tell, and this was Friday night in the most busy season for restaurants. Save yourself the trouble and look for another option. Even Texas Roadhouse is a better value for your money."}
{"text":"My wife enjoyed her grilled chicken Breast. I had the 22oz Porterhouse with a Pinot Noir. Our daughter ordered the Steak Oscar. We all very much enjoyed our meals. I found the atmosphere interesting. It was a comfortable classy room, dimly lit with a beautiful chandelier. What was interesting though was that their was no background music. It was relatively quiet, and you could carry on a conversation with your family without shouting over the noise.
Our waitress was friendly and helpful. The restrooms were clean. Over all we had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Loved their Wine Dinner on Wednesday!  The food was so delicious as always and the owner Dennis and Diane both were so nice and friendly. Definitely will go back there again."}
{"text":"It was what we thought it was. We didn't go for a year and should have kept it that way. Dirty wine glass, hair in food, live singer jamming jimmy Buffett. Wth.  Service was attentive. Food was ok. Better options out there."}
{"text":"Went to JC's last week for the first time. The restaurant is split , one side a bar and the other dining. They have bands playing but it does not interfere with conversation in the dining room. Started out with stuffed mushrooms, they were ok, the problem is you get 3, are you kidding you should at least get 4 or 5 for the money it costs. Got the prime rib and steak Diane, they were ok. Nothing special, have had better, have had worse. The service was good. I think they are a little high priced for the area and the food they serve."}
{"text":"We noticed what had been a Mexican restaurant had become a steakhouse and me being a big beef eater, We decided to take my sister in law and her date there. I had the strip steak medium rare. It was cooked perfectly and hot on the plate. The rub on it was so good I added no seasoning. My wife had the kabob and it was flavorful. My sis in law had the clam chowder and raved about it as did her date who had the scallops. There was no room for dessert this trip. Service was fast and friendly. Price was a bit expensive but reflected the quality meal and was worth it. Jc's, welcome to the neighborhood! We will be seeing a lot of each other!"}
{"text":"Wednesday night beer pairing that was outstanding with Odell brewing Company. What an awesome treat a meal not to be missed five stars,chef Dennis incorporates the brewery with every entrée of the meal doing."}
{"text":"Excellent food!!!! This was our first time here and we will absolutely be back! The Beef Stroganoff was great and the Chicken Strawberry salad was outstanding!!! Best kept secret in Gilbert!!!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. We heard some good feedback, so we thought we would try it. If you go, I think it is way better to sit in bar than dining room. Way better service at bar. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Huge amount of food! We have had a very hard time finding a decent steak in around here. JC's gives it to you. They cook them perfectly and the meat is quite good. They also have pork rinds, one of my favorites. Service is fast and friendly. We were not disappointed. Most evenings they have a live band in the bar, they are also good. They start at 7:30 and play until 10:30 unless the crowd gets them to stay a bit more. I think Saturday is the best time to go for the band, same band every Saturday \"The Harry McGraw Band\" they are very entertaining and play a wide variety of music. Go for the steak, stay for the band. My only complaint is the price. Food seems a bit high, drinks were average."}
{"text":"I decided to try JC steaks because of the great reviews......I wasn't impressed....The reservations I made for 6:30 on a Saturday night were not needed, I wonder why.
I ordered a very dry Beefeaters martini and it should have been served in the proper glass, it wasn't. 
The martini was terrible. I sent it back and the replacement wasn't up to my standards and James Bond would have agreed.
I ordered my house salad with blue cheese  dressing and I got ranch, I sent it back and I think some blue cheese crumbles was thrown in the ranch to fool me, I wasn't. 
My 18 oz medium prime rib was luke warm and very tough....it sure didn't melt in my mouth like the other reviewers raved about. 
The sides of vegetables were very salty too.
My dining partner had a ribeye steak and for the price it wasn't worth it, I buy better ribeyes at my local grocery stores for half the price and cook them 100% 
better.
This steakhouse  will be memorable to me as to remember not to return."}
{"text":"Our favorite place. They always have good music . Diane and Paige are friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved this place 
Met friends for a birthday dinner.  Great ambiance and decor.  Original recipes - great steak, crab legs and halibut.  Finished with death by chocolate cake.  Reasonable price for fantastic meal.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Best steak in town! All you need to know is Cold beer, meat and potatoes!!! 
Who else in town is bringing Reindeer to your table to gnaw on??? Highly recommend"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch and ever. I enjoyed my bacon cheeseburger and wedge salad very much. Can't wait for an opportunity to come for dinner."}
{"text":"i think some of the negative reviews are a bit unfair-restaurants are rarely perfect when they open and generally need a few weeks to work out any issues.  We visited this restaurant for dinner and overall were very pleased.  Loved the decor and the noise level was low.  We ordered several items that people gave negative reviews about, and found the food to be delicious. Calamari was cooked perfectly,  Clam chowder was nice and hot, and petite sirloin and rib eye were cooked exactly how they should be.  Our server was new, so there were some minor issues with service, but the staff is friendly and eager to please.  My only two suggestions would be to serve bread and to have some ambient music in the background.  We will be back and hope others in the area will give this steakhouse a try."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Absolutely love both the food and the staff.  We make it a point to stop in as often as possible."}
{"text":"Another place we want to LOVE but we don't (we want to because it's so close to our house and locally owned). We like it enough for 3 stars. 

The dinner prices are high and it isn't great. We will never go for dinner again. 

But it's worth it for happy hour. Orange Blossom on tap and good appetizer prices. We love the smoked Trout/lobster dip. Very unique and good (add some fresh ground salt and pepper to doctor it up a bit).  The prime rib bites aren't blackened even though they say it is. Add some salt and pepper and they are good for the happy hour price too.
Live music in bar area is loud but usually good cover bands of popular 70s/80s music. I don't mind sitting back, drinking a beer and listening."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed. Upon our arrival I should have turned back around and left. Our reservation was \"misplaced\" at which my disgust was apparent, because a manager came over quickly. His immediate response \"don't get mad at me\". Much to my surprise this was the OWNER AND HEAD CHEF! After the greeter had a long discussion with the bartender we were escorted to table in the corner of the bar. After what seemed to be a stream of clueless servers we were served our drinks. At which time we were not asked if we would like to view the menu. It was obviously assumed that because we were seated in the bar, we were not planning on dining. Not impressed with the food either. The salmon was floating in a pool of butter with no flavor. The steak lacked any taste of beef. The potatoes were a sad substitute for a mediocre main course.  I shouldn't have been shocked by what happened next. While coming to clear our dishes, the server placed dirty dishes from another table on top of our dishes to clear. We then had to flag down any available server to request our check. At no point were we asked if we'd like desert. I thought I was dining at a premium steakhouse, this was not the case."}
{"text":"Horrible, high priced and no customer service. Went in with a party of 4 ordered 2 steaks n 2 seafood dinners. All  4 dinners were under cooked, scallops were quarter sized n raw inside, halibut was the size of a post it note n raw in center. Baked potatoes were so cold when cut into the butter didn't melt. Steaks were riddled with veins n grit. When we sent each meal back they re fired the seafood, replaced the steak and potatoes with new and it was still terrible. Bill was over 200.00 and they didn't even offer a comp. desert for all the problems. Save your money and your time and go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Everything was top notch. The steak was perfectly cooked and flavor was bursting out of it. We also tried the crème brûlée and it was one of the better ones Ive had. I will be back without hesitation."}
{"text":"We've been to JC's twice, and each visit gets better and better.  The service couldn't possibly have been any better.  The waiter was very attentive and engaging.  The food was prepared beautifully.  The creativeness and attention to detail by the chef, Dennis was impeccable. The live music created a nice background to a really exceptional meal. This really IS the best kept secret in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall steakhouse. 
A kitchen oops (cold crabcakes) was quickly fixed. I ordered the prime rib with mashed cauliflower, not at all disappointed! My husband ordered the ribeye and felt like there could have been a little less gristle. Great blues duo singing after 7 as well."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had dinner here for the first time on a Saturday night, and loved that it's 5 minutes from our house!
I remember when it used to be another very old, little rackety shack of of a business ( I can't remember what the business was for sure, but I think it was a food place) and how awful it looked all those years I drove past it. It's now such an open funky-yet-familiar dining establishment! From the moment you walk around the outside of the building you get the sense that a lot of thought and care went into making it a nice place. Once inside the front door you know without a doubt a lot of thought and care went into the renovation. We chose to sit in the bar/lounge area (very small but fun and cozy space) since there is live music on Fri/Sat nights, and we lucked out and got the last table for two, that we barely squeezed into in the corner of the bar. But!...great table because we had a great view of the Harry Macgraw Band! Really great prompt service by Alex, who needed rollerskates, because that guy was working his ass off. He checked back with us several time because it took me awhile to make up my mind on what to eat. We had wine, beer and a few mixed cocktails, the sirloin bites appetizer, the 10 oz Scottsdale cut prime rib entree & the seared scallops entree. The sirloin bites had a good flavor to the meat and were tender, but lacked a little seasoning. They were kind of bland. Salt and pepper at the table helped but they still needed a little something extra from the kitchen. My hubby's prime was fantastic, and my seared scallops were also very good. I went with the soup over salad choice that came with my meal. Soup du jour was Chorizo Pork. They also had clam chowda' and tomato basil, I think? My soup was delicious, but it wasn't a soup, it was sooo think it was like a chili or a stew. It was way too heavy on the tummy before eating something light like scallops. It would have been nice if Alex let me know how thick the soup was knowing that I had ordered scallops. I would have gone with a lighter more brothy soup. I would definitely order the Chorizo Pork again, though! But as a meal with a salad or something. The ambiance is really nice, that band was fantastic! Will JC's Steakhouse be adding a dance floor anytime? Hint! Even a small space to get up and dance, that band was so great we wanted to get up and dance but the one couple that did get up took up the entire dance floor! Including TIP ( always tip well people, it's the right thing to do)  we spent $127 for 1 beer, 1 glass of wine, 4 shots of Disarrono, 1 app, and two entrees. The entrees came with a starch, yummy grilled mixed veggies, soup or salad. We will definitely be back! Thanks JC's for a great long overdue date night with the hubby!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for a late Saturday dinner. We sat at the bar instead of the dinning room. It was a fun experience. There was a live band playing and the food was good. We had the prime rib and stuffed mushrooms. The prices were a little high but not extremely outrageous. We had about three staff members stop by and ask if everything was good. So.... Everything was up to par and there wasn't a bite left on the plates. Needless to say I left there extremely full."}
{"text":"The easiest place to start is the food, outstanding every time! The atmosphere fits the dining experience and you don't have to worry and having children, they love them! They have live music nights and great music on the others. The restrooms and bar are always clean! Best steakhouse in Arizona in my book!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.. Friendly staff.. Really nice bar.. Great food.  Whats more to say.. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Drove by here a few times decided to take the wife here as I saw a sign out front that said \"live music\" 7-10. 
Great , it's 6:50 so we can have dinner and hopefully hear some good music. (which is sadly lacking in this state). We had good service food was okay, not horrid not award winning. 7:30 and \"band\" finally starts. And it's blues zzzzzzzzz.......
Wow yay more boring ass blues. Now some of you may get butt hurt at my posting. My wife and I are musicians and have a long history of playing , writing and recording. So spare me your \"you don't know what your talking about!\" tantrum. 
Some of you may say, \"well it's not the resturants fault they started late!\" yes....yes it is. The restaurant hired them and set the start and stop time. My wife and I NEVER started late. NEVER. And the establishments we played at wouldn't stand for it. We have discovered that music is Az is pretty lame. Sorry JC's Stekhouse. Your food was ok but since you hired crappy blues music and let them start whenever they felt like it, we will go else where."}
{"text":"I have been to a lot of steakhouses and I would have to say this one is meh. I ordered a flat iron and it came a little overcooked but it was delicious and I ate all of it. My wife ordered a steak salad and the steak was as tough as a shoe tung. She couldn't even chew it. They were extremely nice about it and brought us a free chocolate cake. She said it is marinated and the cut is del Monaco never heard of that. Other than that it is good. Their wine selection is ok, no serious fine wine here."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. We had a steak, cheeseburger and kids chicken strips. Everything was good. The kids meal was big enough for both our kids, plus had leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Came here tonight with friends and the experience was not great!! Got there around 6:30 and ordered around 6:45, our food came out at 7:50 and everything was cold or over-seasoned.  The manager didn't want to come and talk to us at all, server barely came around and he didn't seem to care and they weren't willing to comp anything until something was said!! Personally don't need my food comped BUT after waiting and watching tables who came in AFTER us get served and waiting so long for mediocre at best food that didn't live up to their prices I was incredibly disappointed and would NOT recommend this place at all!!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I'm extremely disappointed in the service or lack of I should say. It was my parents' wedding anniversary so I decided to get them a romantic dinner. I stopped by JC's PERSONALLY, not called or emailed, I WENT IN and talked to the host about setting up a romantic dinner for them. He was all over it, \"oh yeah\" he said \"here, let me show you, we can reserve this table for them, get candles, nice table cloth, it'll look really nice\". I said \"I'm buying a $100 dinner, can you throw in a dessert for them?\" He said \"absolutely! We'll even write 'happy anniversary' on the plate\". I liked what I was hearing so I reserved a table for them for that Saturday. 

GUESS WHAT?! THEY GOT NOTHING!!!!!! NOTHING! Not even \"happy anniversary\" from the host or the waiter. No candles. NOTHING! But that's not all the most humiliating part was this...(and I told my mom when I gave them the certificate that they were supposed to get dessert)

They give the waiter the $100 certificate and say \"we think we are supposed to be getting a dessert with this, that's what our daughter told us\". The waiter is not happy to hear that but says \"ok, sure, you want just one, right?\" They say \"uhm, ok\". He says \"no one told me you were supposed to be getting free dessert but ok\". ARE YOU KIDDING ME? You think two elderly well dressed people came in to hustle you for free dessert out of the blue? 

So at this point they already feel a little awkward. Then the waiter COMES BACK with the certificate and says \"I don't see it anywhere that you're supposed to get a free dessert.\" How humiliating is that?! 

I was NOT happy when I heard about their experience. I went in, talked to the host to make sure they would get something a little more special than an ordinary dinner (didn't ask for much, really) and they got humiliated instead! 

Tried sending them an email through their website but got no response so decided to write a review on Yelp."}
{"text":"Unfortunately second time here was beyond disappointing. The service was horrible.. very very slow,  orders weren't accurate , and we literally had to go to the bar twice from our table to get drinks. It's unfortunate,  maybe it was a bad night, but highly unacceptable."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday. The establishment was nice and the food was pretty good. But I wouldn't go there again because the service was AWFUL. The server was so bothered and seemingly so busy it was unbelievable. I had to ask for a refill on water 3 times! The food took a really long time to come out... I ordered a steak (this is a steakhouse) and there was not steak knife. When I finally got her attention she said...\"ok, you guys good, and kept walking.\" I said no...may I please have a steak knife and condiments  her reply was \"one second,\" proceeds to take the order of the table behind me (who just sat down) then she went into the kitchen came back out with a bottle of wine for another table, and then goes and gets my knife and condiments. She comes back just puts it on the table and keeps walking. We still try to make this work and try to order dessert (it is my birthday after all) and she never comes back to the table. I finally ask another server for the bill. She rushes that out, no apology, no how was your meal...just sets the check down and keeps walking. Word of advice. Don't waste your time OR money here."}
{"text":"I am very pleased to write this review not only because of how wonderful this place is, food included, but because of all the negative comments. This place is brand new and like any new place kinks have to be worked out. So if you yelp users are reading these comments keep in mind that most of the reviews were made within first 4 weeks of opening. I have been to this restaurant 4 times now. I love the decor, the service and specifically the food. I would highly recommend the ribeye and if you like seasoning like I do I always ask for any steakhouse to add extra. JC's is not a cookie cutter steakhouse and the fact that it's a mom and pop restaurant should be appealing to anyone of us who loves to support our city of Gilbert. Don't let negative comments clout your judgement give it a try. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I agreed our dinner and service was far better than an expensive anniversary dinner spent at Ruth's Chris. The food, drinks, service and desserts were absolutely amazing! This will be our special \"go to special\" dinner from now on. Go treat yourself!!!"}
{"text":"Last night my husband and I enjoyed a lovely evening out at JC's.  We had very flavorful filets, his 10 oz, mine 6, both prepared and served perfectly at Medium. The crisp Caesar salads were excellent, dressed with just the right amount of their house made dressing. I had mashed cauliflower which I enjoyed as much as the sautéed side vegetables. We did not however save room for dessert.  Next visit we will keep that in mind before ordering. Diana teased us with descriptions of some of Dennis' desserts. Yum. Our server was attentive and helpful. We are looking forward to the addition of music during a future dining experience or bar/lounge visit."}
{"text":"I got the ribeye steak my husband got the 4 mac n cheese with reindeer sausage. This place was really slow, server could not keep the water on the table full we were 1 of 2 tables in the dinning room. My Husband's dish was great, my dish was ok nothing special. I asked for my steak to be on a separate plate and it did not come that way as my Cauliflower mash was swimming in steak juice as well as my vegetables. Our server was less than desirable, slow and not attentive at all. We visited on a Saturday night at 5pm first time here. Not worth the money."}
{"text":"I took my son in for a steak.  I wasn't all that hungry.

First off, for what it is,it seems a bit expensive, but you will figure that out on your own.  It's just not serving the right meals for the prices.

My son ordered the Steak Oscar and it was pretty good.  Appropriate portions (not overloaded with potato) and cooked medium rare as he asked.  It was a bit pricey,but he enjoyed it.  The crab topping was very good.

I ordered a bowl of clam chowder.  This is where my head exploded.  It was $8.99 for a bowl of what tasted like canned clam chowder and not even the good stuff.  To add insult to injury, the bowl was awfully tiny.  It was less than half full and a serious guesstimate is less than 6 ounces of soup!  Maybe they delivered a cup and only filled it half way?  My son didn't want me to say anything, so I waited until I could write this.  Not even toast, just a small package of oyster crackers.  Not so cool.

I'm in no hurry to return unless I hear of massive changes because, well, I expect more for the money.  Not just more soup, but more presentation, more style with the vegetables,maybe some effort in the gravy.

Like I said, he said it was a good steak, but the rest was \"whatever.\""}
{"text":"I think they are going down hill.  Had dinner in the bar.  Service was not great, food was not great.  I had the London broil with smash cauliflower and carrots.  The steak was bland, the cauliflower was not good and the carrots were sweet.  My Husband had the sirloin and crab legs with a baked potato loaded.  He also did not like the carrots.  He finished his steak, said it was a good steak, took the butter off his steak and put on his potato.  When he was all done, then they brought the fixings for the bake potato along with the crab legs.  And they charged us for the potato fixings."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place. When we could finally get a date night. This place was a let down. French onion soup, did not have a full slice of bread, or cheese melted over the whole top. The broth was a little salty, than I like, and there was little to no onions in the soup. I should have known it was going to be worse from here. The steaks came out at a record pace, for good reason. Both mine and my wives steaks were rare, so much so you could have called them blue. We both had are steaks refired and they did not come back cooked again. We both asked for medium rare honestly not that hard. I did not want to go pick up my child yet so we went for the carrot cake. I took about 10 minutes for them to get the cake. After it only took 2 minutes to cook a raw steak. The cake it's self was fair. 

To be far. The waiter was nice, manager was worthless, steak fries great, and the vegetable so so.

In conclusion we will never go back here again. I hope you save yourself the trouble and don't go here either. I would not consider this place ever again"}
{"text":"We will definitely be back.  Their calamari is the best we have eaten.  We had a filet and prime rib and both were delicious. The sides were also excellent and very generous portions.  Our waiter was very attentive.  It's nice to go to a restaurant where the owners visit your table to make sure everything is okay.  It's great to have a neighborhood restaurant that we can visit instead of going to a national chain."}
{"text":"We've both eaten-in at the restaurant and gotten take-out during the holidays when things got crazy.  The different simmered sauces the restaurant serves really makes it stand out and my wish is that they'd promote them more (my favorite is the peppercorn mushroom and my husband's is the blueberry chili which isn't as popular but the kitchen always makes it for him).  The food and service are always consistently great and I would highly recommend for a more casual but fine dining experience (relaxed but hip vibe).  I'm glad the owners wound down some other endeavors to focus on this restaurant, well worth it."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had lived in Gilbert for a year and drove past this restaurant at least 200 times, but we never got around to checking it out until recently.

To call this place an amazing steakhouse does not begin to do justice to the experience that is JC's Steakhouse. We were greeted as though we were being welcomed into someone's home and treated like family while we enjoyed our meal. Both the manager and chef came out to say hello and ask how our food was and just to chat with us.

The food was amazing, truly some of the best cuts of steak that I've ever had (and I've had quite a few steaks in my lifetime), and they were cooked to perfection. Even the salads and sides were delicious!

My boyfriend ended up returning a week or two later (without me, I'm sad to say!) with some Israeli business men who were in the country for a short amount of time; they agreed the steak was absolutely amazing.

Thank you so much for continuing to run a fantastic steak house, and we'll see you quite a bit in the future!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  Everything is made in house.  The Thousand Island dressing was amazing, as was the Creamy Italian.  The fresh baked loaf of bread was yeasty and delicious.  Our party of 7, a mix of adults and teenagers, all enjoyed it.  Our order was a bit of everything, lobster ravioli, scallops, fillet, prime rib, shrimp and beef stroganoff.  Very nice presentation, good atmosphere for carrying on a conversation.  The band was just starting to play as we left so I can't say how they were.  The waiter was very attentive and even told us that for parties of 6 or more the house automatically adds a 20% tip, which is customary, however he did not agree with that and if, for any reason, we didn't feel he had earned the full 20% to call the manger over to deduct it.  None of us had room to try dessert.  We will be back.  My husband wants to take his mom and try the lobster."}
{"text":"I have stumbled across JC's on FB because the Harry McGraw band was playing on a Saturday night, I am a HUGE fan of this local musician. Luckly JC's is right down the street for me. Sat night me and my daughter decide to go down and listen for an hour maybe have a few appetizers. 
I rather eat off an appetizer menu, than order a full meal....anywhere, especially if they have good apps,........no cheese sticks, chicken wings, basket of fries, nothing fried.
When I saw the bar menu, I totally got excited. This is my type of place.
First, the charcuterie board was great. Meats, cheeses, pickles, it was great. I think it could of used some crustinie's, or some type of bread with it.....but still it was great.
Prime rib sliders.....off the hook. I could of ate 12 of them, so good.
Daughter had the Big Mac Martini.....Mac & Cheese, bacon and jalapeño in a martini glass.......HOLY F**)$ that was great. Forget this tiny martini glass.....GIVE ME A BUCKET OF THIS!!! So nice to see my daughter's eyes light up when she took that first bite.

Needless to say Harry McGraw and awesome bar appetizers, I have now found my Saturday night spot.......See you next Saturday!!"}
{"text":"The place was pretty empty for a Friday night at 6:30 which did affect the feel of the place.  The wait staff did a great job.  My husband got meatloaf and I got the 6oz fillet which were both good.  The decorations were nice (missed having candles on the table) and we could hear the band from the bar which was fine (it would have been better had the band been better).  My husband liked it better than I did but I do think we will give this place a try again."}
{"text":"First time at JC's and very pleasantly surprised. Great service and food was delicious. I had melt in your mouth prime rib and husband had prime top sirloin and he enjoyed that too.  Very similar presentation to outback steak house but a step or two up. There was a great band playing in the bar area that we could enjoy in the restaurant. Staff provided great service. An eclectic mix of decor.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"It obviously wouldn't compare to Mastro's or Fleming's but for the price and location, it was surprisingly awesome. So for what it was I am giving it five stars. Excellent steak! The filet was cooked to perfection and had so much flavor. The sides were good- the mashed cauliflower, the complimentary bread, the sautéed vegetables, and a decent side salad. I personally wouldn't recommend the beer chicken- it was way too strong of a flavor but the server really liked it and highly recommended it so order at your own risk. 

The atmosphere was awesome. Live music playing in the background and the decor was so cozy yet still chic- dark wood with industrial accents."}
{"text":"Went on Friday night for first time on suggestion of friends.  Took Uber planning to have a fun night.  We had a large group set up in the back room to watch a friend of ours play music.  Place was busy but what you would expect from a Restaurant on a Friday night.  Sat for 45 minutes asking and waiting for a server that never came.  Not even a sorry from anyone.  Finally starving we rang up Uber again to come get us.  Would have liked to give the place a try but after 30 dollars in Uber for the worst service we have have ever encountered, will not be going back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I met my friend there for a drink and dinner at the bar.I have never had such an unfriendly bar tender.  We got there at 6 :30 on a saturday night and the bar was still rather empty at this point the live music had not started..  Point being he was not super busy.  I cannot give you his name because he never offered it.  Getting his attention was difficult he seemed fairly tuned into the golf game playing above his head.  We finally got a glass of wine ordered and then I was able to grab him one more time to order some food.  He was the unfriendliest bar tender I've ever encountered!.  My friends steak came out with a baked potato.  I had just ordered some potato skins without the bacon.  They did not arrive.  Still no word from our bartender.  My friend proceeded to eat her steak dinner with a butter knife.  Our service was horrible impossible to get bartenders attention and the one time I had got it to order our food he had acted as if we had just truly bothered him.  Approximately, 10 minutes later a woman brought out my potatoes.  Unfortunately, they had not held the bacon.   I was able to trouble the woman for a steak knife for my friend before she scurried off.  I hadn't realized the bacon because it looked like they had put bacon on them and then realized their mistake and picked the bacon off.  Out of let's say 7-8 skins 5 were picked clean of bacon and 3 were not.  It took me a few minutes to realize this.    I couldn't return the food because there was not service the angry bar tender was too busy apparently to look our way or even check on us.  ( bar was still not full)  Mind you my friend and i had both been out of wine for a good 10 minutes before our food even arrived.  He never approached us once without us literally having to raise our voices and wave him over repeatedly.  I explained the bacon and asked it to be removed from the check.There was no apology, nothing.  He brought our check and a manager came over and apologized for the bacon saying she was the one who had brought it out and it should have never happened.  I appreciated that and she did remove from our check.  she suggested I should have returned it .  Honestly, at this point we had to get to our movie and I didn't have the time to speak to how bad the service was and the no wine, no salt or pepper, delay in getting my skins, no steak knife.  I was so disappointed.  They really improved the decor, towards the end of our meal live music began which was lovely, so I really thought this place had potential.  The other thing I should note is they were serving their red wine at room temperature!! I would expect that from a sports bar but not a steak house.  All their red wine was just sitting out at the bar :(.  Unbelievable, that an upscale steak house would do this.  I hope if nothing else this review prompts them to change that.   My friend and I each enjoyed one glass of white which at least that was chilled.  Would have enjoyed more had our bartender not been so bad.  Chill your wine (all of it) and get better service and I might try it again but would not want such another bad dining out experience so may not risk it."}
{"text":"Extremely cool bar area with great service and delicious food. The Prime Rib Sandwich was simply amazing, as was the Bacon Burger (served on a pretzel bun). They had an extensive beer and wine selection and everything on the menu was tempting. The owners came out and talked to us, making sure that we were completely satisfied with our experience, and that's a nice touch, especially in this day and age where things are so hectic that sometimes we lose that face-to-face interaction. It's refreshing to have something so fantastic so close to home, I'm sure we will be \"regulars\" now."}
{"text":"Had a great time first visit. Sat at the bar and talked with the fun bartender Clint and the owner as well Diana. Very down to earth and real people with an excellent ambiance. There was live music and plenty of space and variety. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Three of us dined at JC's for dinner and we were definitely disappointed.  The building from the street looks well kept and we looked up the menu online.  The ambiance was negligent, the only appealing thing about the interior was a chandelier in the entry way.  The staff was somewhat polite, however, the server did not have answers to simple questions on the menu, and he seemed like he did not want to be there. There is no music or anything entertaining in the restaurant.  There were a few tables during the dinner time, otherwise, pretty much empty.  The food was just OK, steaks were not great, I would not recommend the restaurant, sorry."}
{"text":"Driven by this place several times... finally made it in and wasn't disappointed... bartender was very friendly... I ordered the crab legs and they were cooked perfectly...had the mashed cauliflower, which I loved having a carb friendly option! Stuffed mushrooms were great as well! Owner came out to greet us and make sure everything was good.... they have live music fridays and Saturdays but I loved the chill vibe on a tuesday! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here for dinner because we saw it had a grand opening sign. When we first walked in there was a haze of smoke from the kitchen in the dining room. I ordered the London broil and my fiancée ordered the beef kabobs. After a very long wait, the meals come out and the kabobs are rare. We don't usually send meals back but this was actually still rare so we needed to. With the open kitchen you could see the cooks face of confusion as he thought it was cooked correctly. He simply throws it back on the grill so now it comes back burned, but still not cooked. The onions on the kabob were also not cooked, as well as about half of the rice.  We had to turn this back and just say no thanks. This wasn't just a difference in opinion on the meat because we could compare it to the London Broil which was supposed to be medium rare. The kabobs were still deep red and cold in the center, while there was no pink to be seen in the london broil. The London broil tasted good, but was medium well when medium rare was requested. I also expected more for a $22 meal than the presentation it came out as. 

It wasn't all bad. The smoked trout and lobster dip was very good. Also the server we had was very good and attentive. 

Rarely do I say that I won't be going back to a restaurant based on one try. But in this case with how poorly cooked the food was and it was overpriced, we will not be coming back. That's too bad because the place looked like it could have been a nice place."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was even better.  I split the Cajun pasta and a12 oz sirloin both were excellent.  The ambiance was very sleek and comfortably and the service was prompt and polite.  Will definately be back."}
{"text":"This review is actually from new years. Just getting around to posting, but I feel I had to.

Overall it was a terrible experience. Our waitress was the cause of most of it. We ordered dirty martinis and the trout dip to start. The martinis were gross. They tasted link they were sour. I'm not sure how you achieve that with a martini, but thats how they tasted. The dip was not what we expected. Its cold and dry and tastes worse than canned tuna. 

When our waitress finally came around again we asked her for some extra olive juice for the martinis cause we thought maybe they didn't add enough. She came back with black olive juice which we didn't notice until we poured it into our drinks. We thought it was strange and just laughed to ourselves figuring we can just tell the waitress and she would get us new drink. We wold the waitress and she got flustered and same something like thats not what she asked for from the bartender. 

At this point we had been there over 30 minutes and didn't have a drink to drink. At 45  minutes in we still didn't have a drink. The waitress just kinda decided to forget about us. It was obvious she didn't care for us. Wish I could say because it was super busy, but they didn't have that big of sections and the place wasn't completely filled. Probably for a reason. We told the hostess and just left. Dinner at Stone and vine was much better. Wish I knew the waitresses name. I'm sure the place isn't really that bad, but she was terrible at her job. Thin youngish girl."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals, food, and service. We went for happy hour on a Thursday. I had a the happy hour dirty martini (excellent), and we shared an artichoke/spinach dip and the steak bites. The dip was enormous and full of cheesy, artichokey, spinachy goodness and served with lavosh bread - a nice switch from the tortilla chips I've had at other places. The steak bites were flavorful and super-tender. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We been waiting for a good decent steakhouse in the Gilbert area for a long time and we finally have one in JC's. the food and the service has been outstanding each time we've come here to eat.  the food is hot properly prepared, well season and priced very reasonably. the menu is fantastic.....it's not complex and it's not overpriced. the steaks are outstanding, the prime rib is outstanding, the desert are outstanding, and the wine list is very good.  I've eaten at Flemings, Ruth Chris and many other high-end steak houses and those all have their high-priced menus but they're not built right down the street from where we live. this restaurant is right down the street from most neighborhoods in the east side of Gilbert and it's fantastic!!!. I highly recommend them I congratulate the owners on opening a fine store and I hope everyone comes here to eat at least a couple times a month"}
{"text":"Arrived at 10:45 am Sunday morning for their 10am-2pm brunch.Our first time here.To our dismay & disappointment the place was closed.A lousy first impression.We won't be back."}
{"text":"I worked almost 12 hours today and was excited to go to dinner with my husband when he suggested we try this place again.  I say again, because we went the week it opened and had a bad review on the food... But, we figured it was just opening and things happen. The owners were there and were awesome about the whole thing. So, we tried again tonight...last time we will be going there. It took 40 minutes to be able to order, and when we got our food, my husbands was awesome! We barely saw our waitress and when we did she walked by like we weren't even there. My steak Oscar was disgusting... Fatty chewy steak and had no idea what the crab and bernaise sauce tasted like... But not like crab and bernaise sauce!  It had to be thrown away. We're very dissatisfied sadly, because it's close to home and we go out at least once a week."}
{"text":"So glad to finally see something good go into this location! I had the clam chowder for my starter which was pretty good but I'm no food snob. The 6 oz petite fillet was mouth watering good! As for the sides, the veggies were pretty delicious and I had mixed feelings about the mashed cauliflower - but that was just me trying to be healthy. We had a larger party and our server Levi waited on us hand and foot while serving other tables as well. Being with a bunch of noisy Italians I was impressed that he was polite and helpful the whole evening - everything is an event with my family! I would definitely love to come back here and try other items on the list!"}
{"text":"I went here with my wife for my Anniversary, and we both had a great experience. One of the best steaks I've had in a long time. The owner / chef was fantastic. Thank you Dennis. Our server Alex was very personable and the whole experience was very special and fantastic. A wonderful evening."}
{"text":"This was the first time to visit JC's what a great find.  The three must have's great food service and ambiance.  Saline was a great server only her second night working the service was impeccable, she has a great personality.  The food was great prime rib was cooked to perfection that my buddy had.   I ate the Steak Oscar medium was perfect, clam Chowder was different than we have ever had creamy with a hint of lemon.  Live music not so loud that you couldn't hear your self talk.
We will  return on my next visit to Gilbert.   The entire staff was friendly.  Great wine to match the dinner.  Is is a must visit when you are in the area worth the trip."}
{"text":"We were very excited to come here for a date night tonight!  It wasn't exactly what we expected, but ended up being just fine.  The name and exterior made it seem to be a somewhat upscale romantic steak house.  When we arrived we heard kids screaming, and found ourselves in basically an upscale Texas Roadhouse!! Kind of a rustic, western salon type theme.  The food was excellent though!!  Extremely fresh dinner salad to start, along with a reasonably priced cocktail menu.  The Salmon and Prime Rib were both fantastic!!  It was somewhat of a confusing start for us but ended up being a great experience.  Only complaint was a little slow service,  the house was packed and they were obviously understaffed.  They all worked hard though!"}
{"text":"Made reservations for NYE and was glad to get an 8pm seating with only a days notice.  I should have realized then it was a bad sign.  Rough start from the beginning with the host that we had to check in with more than once to an obviously new waiter, Sal.   We ordered mushrooms for an appetizer; they arrived after our entrees.  Salads were not up to par and the same cut of Prime Rib was vastly different!  Had to ask for bread plates and even flatware service!   Bread was doughy and bland.  Baked potato and sides veggies were very salty.  Saving grace was a great Red Blend!  Can't say I'll be back.  Bummer...."}
{"text":"What a miserable experience.  When we entered we noticed that the kitchen was filling the restaurant with an unpleasant amount of smoke.  We should have left, but decided to give it a try.  The server was wonderful, but the food was horrible.  I ordered my fillet rare to medium rare.  The steak I was served was medium well to well done and it was not a fillet.  We waited a considerable amount of time for my companion's salmon salad.  It was sushi rare but not sushi quality.  It was not eaten.

The manager was apologetic and did not charge for the salad.  That aside, this was not a good experience and I do not recommend this restaurant.  The ambience is poor, there are ventilation problems, and the wonderful servers are being hampered by the completely inept kitchen staff.  Perhaps this would be understandable if this was a soft opening but the restaurant has been open for three weeks.  

Go somewhere else if you want a good steak."}
{"text":"Nice place. BUT food was inconsistent, varying from nice, and good, to \"you must be kidding\". Service was attentive, but not at all competent. Steak and salad stood out, all other sides, drinks, wine and desserts were poor at best. Everything seemed to have an up-charge, butter for baked potato, that is extra, sour cream, extra, etc etc We won't be back"}
{"text":"Took my wife out on a date tonight, looking forward to a great experience. I was a bit hesitant after reading through the reviews but decided to give it a shot. I now see what the others were on about. We ordered an appetizer at the same time as our meal, it never came. Ordered prime rib with soup as sides, mine was the clam chowder, she got the French onion. Clam chowder was bad, I felt like Gordon Ramsey on an episode of kitchen nightmares. Bland, terrible mouth-feel, Campbell's would be better. Sent it back. Waiter could not answer even the simplest of questions about the menu. Got a salad instead. My wife's french onion soup was edible, but tasted processed not fresh. 

          Prime rib came and honestly I have not ever experienced less tasty prime rib. Extreme lack of seasoning on the roast itself, the cut was definitely not usda prime, the meat was tough and about 1/3 solid fat. I was suprised and disappointed.

 I really wanted to like this place. It has potential, but it's a restaurant, you have to get the food right! No excuses. Not every customer will give you the chance to make it right, they just won't come back. We didn't let it ruin our night, and had a little laugh about some of it."}
{"text":"Just left this restaurant, went for Valentines Day dinner, got there at 5:30, didn't get order taken until after 6:00, limited menu because of special occasion, didn't get our food until 7:20, as the piano players were saying good night, because another round of people were coming in for our seats! But when we got our food it was raw meat, fine if that's how you ordered it, but we ordered Med-well, so at this point they say they would put it back on the grill, that does wonders for steaks, right?! And like I said another group of people were coming in, so we can't eat the steak, my husband at his potato  and had a couple of beers, so after the hostess was nasty to him he asked for the manager, mind you if the food could of been eaten we would of forgave the slow service! And my husband said I'm not gonna leave without paying for my beer and potato how much do I owe you, and here is the best part, $50.00, are you serious! Up until this point we were gonna come back and try again because things happen! But $50.00, well you can bet we won't be back and I will tell this story to anyone that will listen, we were there for 2 hours and left with only eating a potato and a couple beers, we can't eat raw beef and I know some people love it, but we don't and we sure as heck shouldn't have to or be forced to pay for something we didn't order! Such a huge disappointment! I have never complained about a business because it's tough to have a business these days, but the customer service of charging so much after they messed up, shame on you!"}
{"text":"Greeted promptly as we walked through the door, a nice touch, and we were seated rather quickly. The hustle and bustle of the kitchen right next to our table was not a major distraction and was actually entertaining. Being able to hear the staff communicate was exceptional and professional.

Drinks: An extensive menu, so you can order your usual or try something new.

Appetizer:
Sauteed Mushrooms seemed to be missing two key ingredients ~ Salt & Pepper and probably could have used a few more onions for more flavor.

Soup/Salad/Bread:
Bread: Served warm with butter. Generous portion that was very fresh and tasty.
Dinner Salad: just that. Nothing to write home about, however, the vegetables were fresh.
Soup: French Onion had very good flavor. Could have done with more cheese, however, would highly recommend as served.

Entrée:
Steak Diana: Cooked as ordered (medium), however, a little bit too spicy for the wife's taste (she found the missing pepper from the appetizer). Ordered the add on scallops, they were served well after the entrée and were cold. Staff promptly took care of the problem, however, on the second go round they were served RAW.
Steak Oscar: Also cooked as ordered (extra well) with a very generous serving of crab. This was extremely flavorful and filing. Seasoning and sear were on point.

Dessert: Numerous choices, however, we did not partake as the wife was already upset about her over seasoned steak and the RAW scallops.

Give this experience a mediocre rating since we could have had a similar mediocre meal at the neighborhood mediocre Applebee's. Probably won't be back and most likely won't recommend."}
{"text":"We were hesitant to go here because of some of the other reviews, but were pleasantly surprised!  The Food was great.  We both ordered filet.  It was very tender and tasty, as were the sides.  The bread pudding was great.  Decent selection of wines.  Live music in the lounge was great.  Bartenders and server (Will) provided great service.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Diana and Dennis have continued something really great!  Forget about the past, let's continue with the present.  There's a peaceful easy feeling each and every time I show up here.  From beef tips to die for all the way to halibut to live for, this place is so priceless!  C'mon over, so worthy, so very worthy of your time and business!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this steakhouse. Great food,  great steaks and burgers,  and the best mac and cheese! Nice rustic decor and a great bar!"}
{"text":"Their  fresh homemade soups are the most delicious I've ever eaten. Peanut beef noodle is my favorite."}
{"text":"We were in a large group, heard the food was awesome. We waited at the bar for a drink. We all wanted to be seated. We seated ourselves and waited for server. We ended up getting our own menus. After 45 minutes waiting to even get a drink order- my husband and I left.
The worst service. Plenty of good places, not sure if we will give them another chance."}
{"text":"If I could leave less than 1 star I would. I usually don't Yelp, and this review is from a while ago, but I just kept forgetting to call and I feel compelled. I've worked in the service industry over 10 years so I am always the first to forgive bad service and try to see why the server might be having issues. But NEVER in my whole life of dining out have I had a serving experience that terrible. I wish I could remember the young girls name, but she was never at our table long enough to get it. We sat for over an hour and was unable to drink our wrongly made drinks, (that never got fixed even when complained about, dirty martinis that she gave us BLACK olive juice to pour in) or eat our appetizer that I can only pray was a mistake because it was inedible (that also never got fixed). We felt terrible having to complain at all because we never send things back! She left everything on our table. We were ignored, even when making eye contact with our server who obviously didn't want to come around. I've never been treated that way, ever. I've told many many many people not to come to this restaurant due to this experience and they all said they wouldn't after hearing the full story! Worst dining experience of my life. We eventually had to get up and leave due to no food and no service after over an hour! Save yourself an hour and just go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. Melt in your mouth deliciousness! We went on a Saturday night. Not busy at all. Got right in! To the hostess surprise, we wanted to sit outside.  We don't mind the heat and it was a beautiful night. We were celebrating our anniversary, were without children and there was a loud band inside. So being outside gave us quiet alone time to enjoy our meal. The food was AMAZING! My husband had their signature reindeer sausage and he loved it. I had the steak oscar and it was like a meal from the islands. The presentation was even incredible!!! The service was spot on! If I have to complain about something, everything outside was filthy. But then again, we were the ones that wanted to be out there. I'm sure no one had sat out there in awhile. We would love to go back sometime. But it's pricey. Maybe another anniversary. ;)"}
{"text":"Sat in the bar last night and had a great time with the hubby. Cubs game was on and there was fantastic live music too. What a wonderful Gilbert gem to sit, relax, munch on some delicious food and knock a few back. 

We ordered the medium wings and split a bleu cheese burger with steak fries. The wings were perfectly crispy, huge & had a heat that lingered in the mouth and the bleu cheese dipping sauce was really good with a garlic flavor to boot. The chef here is no joke! I swear everything is made from scratch. The burger was delicious as well, juicy and flavorful with plenty of bleu cheese on top. Steak fries were thick cut and well seasoned."}
{"text":"Okay, as I said I read the reviews and decided to try anyway. Started out fairly good. I  hope the management reads and pays attention to the reviews that are written. Tried the dinner salad - was good but could have been colder. Had to ask for the bread. Noticed specials on a board after going to the restroom, even though on a board, it would be good for wait staff to present the special(s). Ordered the filet med and it was medium rare very center. Told management in hopes they would address fixing it for the next customer. It was right at 35 minutes from order to being served. Taste was good, baked potatoes were cooked very well. Veggies were good, but could've been hotter. Okay, now for the dessert this where it went wrong asked for creme burlee- choice chocolate or pineapple; chose chocolate - it wasn't a creme burlee it was chocolate pudding with carmalized sugar on top! It's pricey and will not be a destination any time soon. Had music in the bar which was loud and the acoustics are poor so the places becomes loud and isn't conducive to a conversation. Turn the volume down. The waiter was good till we told him the dessert tasted like chocolate pudding and lacked the texture of creme burlee. The place has character just needs a few attention to details."}
{"text":"What a nice night out with my wife! 
We live close by and have been wanting to try this place for a while now! 
Our waiter was very good ! Not the best but definitely not a bad one! He was professional and kept checking in on us! But I'm a stickler for when I have to ask for a refill! 

The atmosphere is very laid back and comfortable. I love the rustic feel in the place. 

Bathrooms are cleaned and well maintained. 

The prices are reasonable and the taste is on point! 
I got the 10oz filet and my wife got the filet burger and both were cooked perfectly! 

The French onion soup is amazing and the spinach artichoke dip is awesome! 

Love that they had gentleman jack as well ! 

The death by chocolate.  Chocolate cake is also amazing !

We will be back.  

Defiantly a hidden gem! 

So happy we have a good steak house close by now. Sorry it took us so long to try this place"}
{"text":"One more amazing meal.  Great service, food, music..... JC's has it all and more. It's our go to place to relax and enjoy....."}
{"text":"Arrived for a wedding reception, and while it was a fun experience, there were just a couple things lacking. Let's start with the food. Even though it was a self-serve style reception, the portions of meat personally cut for you were huge. There was no way one could walk away hungry. That being said, the food was kind of bland. From the prime rib to the \"special\" mac and cheese, there was a lack of stand out flavor and texture in the food. 

The wine menu was quite impressive, though I'd have liked to have seen more variety on the beer menu side (only one IPA, one stout, one weizen, one pilsners, etc. on the list). 

The service though, was beyond exemplary. Our waitress, whose name eludes me, was one of the best waitresses I'd seen in action. Promptly accommodating guest requests in an unusually courteous and quick fashion for a room of 30+ people, and her being the only waitress tending to us. 

JC isn't a bad experience, but it isn't something I'd seek out to return to. The waitress herself though, deserves most of the star rating I am awarding it."}
{"text":"Had dinner. The waiter and bar staff was very attentive and friendly. Bar drinks were made very well. Good selection on wine and spirits. Food was very good. For appetizer we had the smoked trout and lobster dip, the charcuterie board, and split the prime rib dinner. All were \"have again\" items.  Seemed reasonably priced too.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"The positives are the service and the menu which is very Keto-friendly.  Mashed cauliflower is an option instead of potato or rice. Salads were good, my husband got chili that he said was good. 
My husband and I got the 12 oz Sirloin. Both of ours was VERY gristly and had a lot of fat to cut off. I got mine medium-well which apparently meant burnt on one side (with black inedible charred parts) and the other side barely cooked. He said his steak was good. We each had a pile of gristle and fat cut off the size of a deck of cards. I also got double veggies which was supposed to be a mix of zucchini, Brussels sprouts, peppers, onion and mushrooms. In my double order, I got exactly 1/2 of a sprout (which was completely raw) 2 halves of a mushroom and 3 slices of zucchini, 2 of which were raw. The rest was onion and green and red bell pepper slices. 
I almost forgot! (That's how memorable it was!) we also got the steak bites (something along those lines-not the prime rib ones) which was five grape sized pieces of seared beef sitting in a pool of grease-$9.99 minus $2 for happy hour. 


For the price, I recommend the Keg."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is casual and welcoming, and appeals to everyone. We were greeted kindly and sat upon arrival (called ahead and they were able to accommodate us on a Friday night!).  Drinks were promptly ordered and delivered, and stayed full throughout the meal. Our appetizer was forgotten however they were honest about forgetting to put it in and it was then delivered quickly-and was delicious!!!! They kindly comped it and were very apologetic. Meals were excellent and service was great! Can't wait to go back and try out other items!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to JC's a few times with friends. Nothing great, nothing terrible. Every time hoping it would be better. Being small business owners we like to support others, however the last visit was completely awful. We were a party of four adults, we started with the charcuterie board... what a joke... no complaints though, we were still hopeful. We all ordered our entrees and our server was very sweet I should add. All of the meals were \"okay\" except for the filet medallions I ordered and asked to be cooked medium. They came out completely rare with just a sear on one side, I let the server know, she told me the policy with undercooked meat was to take it back to the kitchen to finish cooking, which was fine, but the medallions came back like they were nuked in the microwave. We asked the server to let the manager or owner know that we were very disappointed and would not be back. There was no response or word from any management. We paid our bill and left, medallions uneaten. I literally brought them home to feed them to my two pups. I debated on doing this review on yelp, deciding that I would privately email the restaurant to give them the benefit of the doubt and just get an apology. That was 3 weeks ago, so here I am. This restaurant won't last long."}
{"text":"Driving down Gilbert Rd and Ray and saw their sidewalk signage that they were serving lunch 
Glad we stopped (first time here) had a large sandwich which we had to split - excellent- 
The place was clean / the service was good / the owner/chef came  by to talk to us 
Checked out their dinner menu - will definitely come back for dinner 
There is entertainment on Friday & Saturday"}
{"text":"My hubs and I tried this place out in March 2015 for his birthday. Although we enjoyed the look/decor of the place, there was no music playing so all you'd hear was the kitchen clatter echoing through the dining area. 

We ordered the charcuterie board as an appetizer which we enjoyed. Everything else after that was just \"meh.\" 

We had clam chowder, ribeye steaks, mashed cauliflower and mixed veggies all of which tasted bland, as if it was prepared cafeteria style. It looked very appetizing but it was disappointing. 

We skipped dessert because they were out of chocolate cake and the creme brûlée wasn't set. The price for the food was too expensive for the quality & atmosphere. 

I will say that our waitress was lovely and gave us wonderful service."}
{"text":"Well let me fill you in.... this place ROCKS!!! First time eating here. From the moment you enter the establishment,  you are greeted by very friendly staff and everyone you walk by says hello with a sincere smile. The decor is classy, rustic charm to it... from floor to ceiling. The chandelier is over the top fabulous!! My mom and I were seated right away and everything from drinks, appetizers and entrees oh and dessert were delivered in great time! No long waits in between any of the courses. Everything we ordered had great flavor.. cooked perfectly! Every item on our table was fresh. And when I took my first bite of my sirloin steak ... I took a trip down memory lane to when my dad used to grill his famous T-bone steaks on the grill. Literally for me this was soul food.  Appetizer: Crab cakes - they tasted freshly made (not out of a freezer) and had a bit of a kick... just thee best crab cakes I have had by far.  The Caesar side salad was just as yummy... the dressing rocked and there was thick shaved parmesean....so yummy! The sauteed fresh veggies tasted so good. No funny taste like they came from a bag in the freezer (you know what I'm talking about) and a lovely rice pilaf to boot. Then we ordered the Death by Chocolate cake to share... did not disappoint at all!!! Again the staff was very attentive and the manager came by several times to make sure we were doing fine and even cleared dishes off or topped our tea off. That doesn't mean our waiter was not around. He was there just the right amount of times checking on us and clearing dishes and filling our glasses too.  When leaving... the same.. every employee you crossed paths with or caught their eye.. they said thank you for coming in and have a great weekend. 
Bottom line...  we WILL be back and as often as possible!"}
{"text":"We had a three top and we liked all the food. I Ike the atmosphere and staff. The chef even  came out to say goodnight. I'm definitely going back when I have people in town."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved. We almost didn't come bc of the negative reviews but glad we did. We Took my MIL here, first time for for all of us. Kiddos had burgers, MIL and Husband had the prime rib and I had the petite filet. 

The kids ate everything and stated it was the best burger they have ever had. For preteens that hate everything, this is a big deal. Both husband and MIL thought it was outstanding prime rib, full of flavor and melted in their mouth. I am a huge fan of filet and I have to say, it rivaled some of the Steaks I've had around the county. So unbelievably tender and the perfect amount of flavor. 

As for the side dishes, we had roasted carrots that we could not get enough of. They set a little sweet with a hint of cinnamon and apricot. Salads were extremely fresh and the bread seemed homemade. 

As for the service, they were very attentive. There were no delays and we wanted for nothing. Super impressed and I'm not easily impressed. 

Lastly, this is a cute hip little place with greaT atmosphere. We will go back for sure. I hope people don't get turned off by the negative reviews and that the manger reads them to make sure the mistakes are not repeated."}
{"text":"Empty patio.... Empty dining room... And turning away business because they have a booked dining room with an offensively loud lounge singer. If you want to loose business this place will give you a class. -rico"}
{"text":"We wanted so badly to like this place. We went for a Saturday night date night with another couple. At around 6:30 on a Saturday evening, we were a little surprised at how few cars were in the parking lot but I think now I understand why.

We were pleasantly surprised by the decor--they did a really nice job. So I was surprised when we were handed flimsy, self-print menus with very little description for the items. Two of us started with the cocktail special, a cucumber lemonade martini which was excellent. We ordered two appetizers, a shrimp cocktail and the charcuterie platter, which the waitress wasn't able to describe.  For $12, we were surpirsed at how paltry the charcuterie platter was. The salami was the most tasteless I'd ever had, the reindeer sausage lacked flavor and was inexplicably wet with a water substance pooled on the platter. And what they called beef jerkey seemed to be burned cast-offs from the steak. It was completely inedible. The absolute worst was that the fresh mozzarella had turned. I actually had to spit it out and slap the fork out of my husband's hand. We alerted the waitress, who appologized and said the chef would come out to talk to us. We never saw the chef and, frankly, we saw very little of our waitress. Despite there being few other patrons, the service was TERRIBLE.

I had intended to order the halibut, but after the bad cheese incident, I didn't have much appetite. I ordered just a French onion soup which was fairly good, and we were impressed with the quality of the vegetable sides on the other entrees. The veggies were fresh, not frozen, tender crisp and well-seasoned. The steaks were just okay. They weren't terrible, but they weren't the best cuts, either and there were a few mouthfuls of gristle left on the sides of the plates. The Diane sauce was good but really heavy on the pepper, too heavy, really. 

The pricing seemed really out of whack, too. Our delicious cocktails were $6 which seemed like a bargain to me, but everything else seemed irrationally steep given the quality.

The worst part, though, was really the service. There were so many people working and it took ages for our waitress to revisit our table. I'm not sure if she was new or just really bad at the job, but it really ruined what was already a less-than-stellar experience. When our bill FINALLY came, I was floored to see the charcuterie platter on our bill (which we sent back maybe half eaten after the whole cheese thing). I had to actually ask her to remove it from the bill, which she ultimately did.

We really want to patron our local businesses and see them thrive, but there's no way this place will. With terrible service, off-kilter pricing and food that is at best fairly good (veggies) and at worst, literally spoiled (cheese), I just don't see how it's possible. Hopefully the bartender finds a new gig before this place goes under. The cucumber lemonade martini was the only redeeming part of our meal."}
{"text":"Our realtor and his wife took us to JC's for dinner. It was really wonderful! Food was fresh and delicious! The owners came out and chatted with us for awhile. Service was exceptional and the atmosphere was nice. Quiet enough to talk without raising our voice but not slow either. I had a steak that was perfection and my husband had shrimp I think. Not cheap but worth the money!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Omg! Find of Gilbert!! We celebrated our Anniversary Dinner here. You cannot go wrong! All our food was exquisite
Angie was our waitress! What a doll. 
I guarantee you won't be disappointed. JM"}
{"text":"Service was good. Soup was good. Husband had the ribeye because they were out of the Porterhouse. He enjoyed it said it was better than Texas Roadhouse. I had the halibut... I will try something different next time, flavor was ok but it was a little too over cooked and dry and for $30 portion was small compared to other places I've been. Daughter got the Mac n cheese, it was a homemade mac n cheese not the Kraft like at some restaurants.. It was good! I will come back and try it out again. Maybe I'll give change my rating if the fish isn't over cooked next time..."}
{"text":"Best filet I have had in Arizona! Good salad and the mashed cauliflower was excellent. Good service and nice casual atmosphere. Love this restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here tonight and everything from the food to service was fantastic!!!  Service:  Our waiter was a young gentleman and he was awesome!!  We never waited for drinks and he had a great personality.  The food: Husband started w/ the crab cakes and he really enjoyed them, crispy on the outside and moist and tasty on the inside.  Both of our salads were super tasty!!! The ceasar was insanely good with fresh green greens (not a lot of those white stalks) and fabulous Parmesan shaved strips!!    The bread =  hot, soft, YUM!!!  Entrees were both juicy, and seasoned / cooked perfectly!!!!  I got the filet mignon and husband got prime rib. WE WILL BE BACK!!!!   Thank you for a wonderful night out, JC's!!"}
{"text":"Yum!!! 
Good food, great service!
Recommend the Delmonico - nice tender cut.
New fav non-chain steakhouse."}
{"text":"My husband I went last night for dinner. Arrived close to six and were seated right away. Great decor and atmosphere!  I love the chandelier!  Service was friendly and attentive and our orders were timely. 
We ordered the smoke trout based on other reviews here and weren't disappointed it was really good!  Then we each ordered the Steak Diana with mashed cauliflower on the side. I loved that they had cauliflower as a substitute for potatoes. We enjoyed our meals, we both loved the sauce and the vegetable sides too. 
We will definitely be returning soon.h"}
{"text":"Service and people are great.  I had the steak sandwich.  Probably the best steak sandwich i've ever had.  Great place, can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience my wife and friends had. From the minute we walked in the staff were genuinely friendly. The owner Diana couldn't be any sweeter and on the spot with her recommendations on what to have for dinner. Prime Rib was tender with lots of flavor, the pork chops were phenomenal!!  What a perfect night with a great band to go along with dinner. New regulars for life!! Can't say enough, a must try for any occasion."}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere!
Food was amazing. Brussel Sprouts were made to perfection 
French Martini
And the Filet was superb

Staff very personable. It was Ellie's first week 
But you would never have known"}
{"text":"First visit was a disappointment. Ordered 10oz filet medium rare, 1/3 of it was fat and grisly. Why would a chef even think that was ok to be served? Sent it back. Next out; super rare barely warm filet, again, why would a chef think that's ok?
Another in our party ordered the bacon cheeseburger, the bottom bun was gross, dripping, mushy grease.
At least two other dishes were a disappointment as well.
Won't be back.
Atmosphere was nice, service was lacking."}
{"text":"A mediocre letdown after finally getting around to trying this place! The food was slightly above average and the service was downright awful. Perhaps this is a western norm, but when I go to a steakhouse that is $30 a plate, I am used to dressing for the evening. We were clearly overdressed in cocktail attire as many other customers were in shorts and flip flops! Although we had a reservation, it took 20 minutes to seat us even though there were several open tables. Our waiter didn't even acknowledge our presence for a solid 10 minutes and touched our table a total of three times for the entire visit. It took twenty minutes from seating for us to receive our drinks, which were both ordered and delivered by what seemed to be a manager. Our waiter was the biggest letdown of the evening as he was very attentive to his other surrounding tables but seemed to forget we existed. The spinach artichoke dip was very tasty. We liked the prime rib but were very disappointed in the steak Diana which was an unforgettable experience of eating nothing but peppercorn. The sides were nothing to write home about. All in all, the food was slightly above average, however, not worth the cost and the service was abominable."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent live music in the back.  I support live local music and JC's Steakhouse only hires high caliber talent.  Extremely entertaining.  And close to home."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped to try JC Steak house tonight.  The environment was nice an open. The steak was perfectly cooked and the side dishes were delicious. All delivered by a friendly and proficient staff. Great place to go if you are hungry for a good steak!"}
{"text":"The monthly wine dinners are amazing! Dennis and Diana do a fantastic job pairing the food and wines."}
{"text":"Not very impressed with this place. However the front of the house staff were pleasant and friendly. I ordered the Alaskan Salmon and it was raw and had no seasoning. The veggies were cold and mushy and the mashed cauliflower had no seasoning as well. I sent back the salmon and they came back out with my plate that still had the veggies and mashed cauliflower and said they put the salmon back on the grill. Five minutes later they brought my original salmon back out barely cooked. I asked them to take it off the bill and I sent it back. Mind you this was a $25.00 salmon plate. I would suggest going to outback you get better quality food for cheaper. It really is a shame that this place left much to be desired since we live so close. I would suggest either lowering their prices to reflect the food quality of investing in a new chef."}
{"text":"We went opening night for the Grand Opening. Service was good. Nice waitress but she was still learning the menu so that was understandable. Salads for all of us were good. The clam chowder was great. I ordered the scallops and they were much smaller than I imagined, but I ate them all and they were good. My husband and his friend got the steak. I think the only complaint was the price. The steaks were not amazing but your average steak. We expected this place to be affordable and it definately was a pricy night. It was a little smokey in the place, but I really could care less. I'm not that picky. SO all in all....food was average, service average....and we will probably give it another try since we live so close by."}
{"text":"4 of us met here for Christmas Party last night. The service started out ok at the bar. After being seated We ordered the smoked salmon and trout dip. To our suprise it was served cold.we also ordered the sautéed mushrooms and they had little flavor.  I had to get up 3 times and go get some one to wait on us for drinks. There was only 4 tables with people at the so it was not busy at all. 
Once we ordered falet mignon oscor you know with crab on top and received it the crab on top was less than a teaspoon. The baked patato was cold as was the veggies. Again I get up and ask for the manager and this gal said I am the owner. Our friends had a salad and was served without the dressing she ordered.  I explained that everything was cold and she said she would make it right but we were hungry so we ate it cold. Needless to say the food was bland and had very little flavor.  She did bring a few more cold patato but didn't help. She asked what she could do for us and I offered for her to make the ticket right and she said she would. To our suprise once we received the bill the OWNER only put a $7 discount on it. Unbelievable!
So now we have went there twice all in one night. First and Last Time!!"}
{"text":"OK.  I promised I would update this review and I am.

My second trip to this restaurant was much better than the first.

Service?  Extraordinary.  Fast.  Many trips to the table to check on things.  Couldn't have asked for a better waiter.

Food.  Pretty good.  My wife got the petite filet again with a salad.  My granddaughter got the children's mac n cheese and it was really good, and there was enough to feed two kids.  I ordered the prime rib, which was good, albeit a little tough.  I think that was my fault.  I ordered it medium well instead of medium rare.  Dumb.  Dumb.  Dumb, and I will own that mistake.  My salad was awesome and plenty of free bread.

The reason for the jump from two stars to five?  I ordered an Old-Fashioned (cocktail), took a sip and was shocked--stunned really--that it actually contained alcohol and wasn't some watered-down well drink like you will get at a lot of restaurants.  When I order a drink, I want some frickin' booze in it and this drink had frickin' booze in it!  This bartender knows how to mix an Old-Fashioned.  Good drinks.  'Nuff said.

We also had dessert, which was incredible.  A piece of chocolate cake that I shared with my wife and grandbaby.  Delicious!

Price?  I think we skated out of there for under $80.  Not bad for steaks, drinks and desserts for two and a child's meal.  I can only assume that my first visit was an anomaly, so I am giving the full five stars.  This is a terrific standout restaurant in a town (Chander/Gilbert) Arizona where there is a dearth of standout restaurants."}
{"text":"If your looking for good French onion soup this is not the place. I think the chef has a serious salt issue. I think my blood pressure went up from a 1/4 cup. Dinner very unimpressive. Gotta be the worst prime rib sandwich in Az. Service was awful I'm really awful. Server didn't even ask how dinner was intel she came and asked if we saved room for dessert.hell no how about some of our SALT CAKE!!! Unfortunately this is really close to we're we live. The bar actually was busy and seemed like it might have been a good time... wouldn't come back again..."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! We have drove by so many times and said we should go,but never did. I'm sad we waited so long!!!

The inside is modern, yet charming. The menu has something for everything. Good for a special occasion or for groups. 

We both had prime rib and enjoyed the cut. I got some of the best Alaska king crab that I have had since we moved from Alaska!!! My husband's lobster we cooked to perfection. 

I can't wait to go back with friends!"}
{"text":"5 STARS on food. Prime Rib was awesome in flavor & presentation.  4 1/2 STARS on atmosphere. Cozy rustic but due to high ceilings and cement flooring a little loud. Great service. We will be back."}
{"text":"The penny pasta with shrimp was unbelievably excellent. the sauce might have been the best I've ever had for this type of dish. My wife's steak was also outstanding. The only downside might be the décor which was dark and a little rough around the edges but the food was just wonderful."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in The East Valley. Steaks are cooked to perfection every time I've eaten here. I also LOVE the clam chowder and beef stroganoff. Weekends are fun in the bar/lounge area with live music and a fun vibe. Ask the bartender Alex for a delicious chocolate martini. This place is perfect for date night, special occasions, or just a night out for dinner."}
{"text":"Have not had dinner here yet BUT lunch awesome. 

Italian sandwich rules! BLT, chicken salad sand and green chili burger highly recommended by my friends. I cannot branch out from the Italian sandwich though."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our meal.  I ordered the rib special - Oh my goodness - the rack hung over the edges of the plate.  Quite good, and enough for at least 2 more meals.  Dennis makes great soups!  I had a corn and green chili soup he'd whipped up.  Husband had a petite filet, and he usually complains about something.  Not this time.  Great food, service, and I love hearing live music."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My small work dept went here for our Christmas lunch!  Prime Rib Sandwich with steak fries was amazing!! A non chain steakhouse!  Do yourself a favor and go here and eat!!"}
{"text":"It took 10 minutes to even have our drink orders taken. Was only given 1 steak knife and service was pretty slow. Had to have someone get our waitress to refill our drinks. The Prime rib was good but not worth the cons of this experience."}
{"text":"Was looking for a close Steakhouse and happen to find this one Gilbert. The lack of signage makes the place difficult to find and not stand out as much. The inside dinning area was very comfortable and looked very inviting. Ordered a prime rib sandwich with Au Jus on the side. Needless to say the sandwich was VERY salty and the bread was soggy. The Steak fries almost too big to eat in one sitting. Overall not a bad place for dinner, but I would avoid it if you are sensitive to overly salty foods."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER!!! Came here for my dad's bday with reservations. We waited 15 minutes just to get acknowledged and ordered immediately because we were starving...it took our waitress 25 min just to bring us water and I was parched. The food took another HOUR, and counting...I'm still here. They have became very generous with their water portions though...making sure we're full of water.  Won't ever return."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night at 7:45, plenty of table available. Bar tables were full but plenty of tables in restaurant area. Let's start by saying the 10 oz. Filet was perfect. Great flavor and cooked to perfection Medium well which is hard to do. Matter of fact all food from kitchen was excellent. Waiter was confusing very obvious a new employee. Then another waiter came by but was at wrong table she was new second day!
Now let's talk about the bar. Very long time to get a drink, the wait staff always apologized about the wait. I ordered Bombay and tonic with a lime.Nice! Wife ordered a Lemon drop martini, completely made wrong. Seems like ingredients were left out. Ask for some Triple Sec to ad to drink trying to make it drinkable. That did not work, Ask waiter to take drink back and she will have a Vodka and cranberry. Wow, so strong that was undrinkable. Received bill Lemon drop martini was not removed from bill. asked waiter to remove drink since it was made wrong, he stated it was correct and he will not remove it. He then began to argue with me. Wow really!!
Waiter stated he just started and you could tell he didn't know what he was doing. Also at least 3 different times wait staff came over with food we did not order, wrong table. It was distracting to say the least. So much for a Happy Anniversary! 4.5 stars for food and 1 star for wait staff and 0 stars for bartender service and mixology. Band sounded very good also.02/25/2017"}
{"text":"Last chance. Walking in with no one else waiting we where told the 2 of us would have to wait 10 minutes for a table to be cleared. I looked and 6 tables where sitting empty mixed though out. Already a weird start.  

I just wanted a decent burger and thought a steak house should be able to deliver. WRONG. Why is it pretzel buns have become so popular? It broke into pieces just after picking it up. Yes the meat was juicy and I wouldn't think I would ever be the one to complain about too much but it was so much it soaked the bread and plate with grease. I also like onion but not when it's 1/4 of the end of one with the skin still on it. Yes I enjoy steak fries but what they call steak fries is a potato cut into 4 strips, dropped into pepper and deep fried. That's not steak fries, it's potato wedges. Nice idea but poor execution on all accounts."}
{"text":"How amazingly accommodating!  So here is the real life tale that leads me to this review.  My eldest son Anthony turned 23 yesterday.  This is the first time in 4 yeas that we could celebrate together because of his service in the military.  Last week he requested Chicken Carbonara for his b-day dinner.  Okay, good.  Well, Monday my wife ended up with a cast from her knee to her toes on one of her feet, and Tuesday morning I got a call that my office had flooded due to a burst pipe in the office lavatory.  I lost most of the day extracting water and moving desks, file cabinets, etc, you get the picture.  I called JC's  and spoke with Dennis the owner and explained my situation, and asked him if he could make Anthony's requested dinner even though its not a menu item.  I also asked if it could be served family style and if had room to have us all there.  He didn't hesitate one second to assure me that it was no problem,  he'd be happy to help.  As it turns out, we had our whole family, 11 of us and not only did JC's do a great job with the food, but the environment they set up for us was exactly what I was looking for.  We had spoken regarding the main course and in all of my craziness, that's all I talked about!  They thought about the thinks that I failed too and took care of us like family!!  Everything was served family style, from the first course of a fresh garden salad and fresh baked (still warm) honey wheat bread, through the main course which was an excellently prepared Chicken Carb and baby carrots prepared with brown sugar and butter, and finally, a  beautifully decorated birthday cake complete with candles!  What I really wanted to convey to the world is how grateful I am to Dennis, Dianna, Paige  and Alex our servers.  This was truly a special occasion in a difficult situation, and they made us feel so at home and special.  I don't care how much you spend, you can't buy this compassion and degree of accommodation. Anthony will long remember this dinner and I will always be grateful for allowing us to have this evening.  We created a family memory that focused on our sons' first birthday home in years."}
{"text":"Had another fantastic dinner!  Their steak burgers are to die for.  Also the bananas foster, yes!"}
{"text":"MISSING THE MARK 
Wife and I went here as I was looking for a good classic steak dinner of Filet Mignon and she wanted seafood.   The city reviews made this seem like a good alternative to the chain steak houses.  First impression was great as the hostess was very friendly and seated us promptly and got our waters.  From there it went downhill.  Primarily in service but also execution and value.   The waiter while appearing attentive kept missing the basics of filled waters and asking if we wanted water when it was clearly empty I Had 2 drinks and it took almost 7 minutes for the bar to serve each one and I had to ask twice But the restaurant was 70% empty.  
Steak was ordered as medium and assured it would be done perfect as they show it in their menu.  It came out rare and cold in the middle.  Wife's scallops where 3 small scallops and cost $26???
It took almost 2 hours from time we entered to time we paid.  Total bill was $100, given the portion sizes and slow service on everything except the bill.  Not the value. 
The decor was ok and the ambience at first was great.  Comfortable but chic.  That was until they had a live band in the bar area so loud while they still had the recorded music playing in the dining room speakers  and the people still eating dinner.  7:30 is still dinner time. The band should not have started until 9.  It was so loud the waiter couldn't even hear and all the patrons conversations could be heard now. Epic fail
We were hoping to find that diamond in the rough that we could go to regularly and enjoy patronizing a local Gilbert business.  This wasn't it."}
{"text":"Didn't know this place existed and it's less then a mile away from my house. Great service, awesome food and you can't beat the prices! They had a live band playing in the bar area which was nice. Definitely my go to spot now for a filet and some drinks."}
{"text":"Have actually avoided this place because of the 3.5 stars what a mistake!! The food was amazing the staff above and beyond!! This will definitely be a regular spot!! FYI the filet bites on app menu are amazing! Had the filet Oscar for dinner and only thing bad I can say is I wish there was less crab and more Oscar sauce. Amazing and great staff!"}
{"text":"Never again, we ordered two meals plus a drink, we did not care for the drink the waitress very kindly offered to remove it from the bill. We got the bill it was still on there. When we asked her she said she spoke to the owner and she refused to take it off. It's a shame to loose a customer over 11.00, very poor service when you don't stand behind your employees attempt at customer service."}
{"text":"Im updating my review from 4/25/15. After waiting more than a year,  and seeing reviews improve the last 6 months, we decided to give JC's another try.  We're glad we did. While for a steakhouse, the cuts still seemed a bit tough, especially when noted as 'prime' on the menu, they were prepared perfectly as ordered, and seasoned very nicely. The mashed cauliflower was a pleasant surprise. The wine selection very nice. Staff were busy, but warm and attentive. Without reservations on a Friday night, we waited less than 10 minutes to be seated in a nice booth.  The only thing we didn't care for was the din of noise spilling from the bar into the dining area, but that may be on Fri/Sat nights only.  We'll go back again. Happy to have a place like this so close to home."}
{"text":"So delicious and the perfect setting for a company Xmas party. This place was amazing in food and service. We will be booking for next year. I can't compliment the food enough! If really was beyond flavor."}
{"text":"Great little steakhouse in a cool building.  The prime rib is some of the best I've had.  Super attentive service, including the owner/chef checking in."}
{"text":"Yes a place were you can enjoy the best of both worlds...Great tender fresh cut steak prepeared to your liking.. also fresh seafood flown in from Washington State 2-3 times a week ...If you like great food then do yourself a favor and stop in...And on weekends you can enjoy Live music in the Lounge...Cheer's Bluesman Mike"}
{"text":"We have been into JC's for a couple of occassions and both were great.  One was a football party in the bar.  Food was way better than most bar food.  We had the blackened prime rib bites, jalapeno mac and cheese and bananas fosters to top it all off.  Later we went back for date night and split the blue cheese burger.  Always the quality of food was exceptional and the serivce was great.  Glad to support this local restaurant and help their business grow.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This lovely establishment was well worth coming down to! I ordered the beef kabobs which were sweet and savory and utterly mouthwatering served over a bed of tasty rice. I could not put my fork down! Also, the service and environment was awesome! The owner personally came over to our table and made sure our meals were satisfiable.
I love the decor and open feel of the restaurant, not sure what people were referring to when they said it was smoky because the air was clear as can be!
Overall the experience was fabulous and thoroughly enjoyable, I definitely suggest it to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here for belated father's day dinner but wasn't too pleased. I ordered as it shows on the menu, crab cocktail but got crab cake. We decided to eat it since it was brought out but it didn't taste anything like crab. Clam chowder was very salty with lots of potatoes with its' skin.
Our entrees were pretty good. This place is okay for entrees but nothing else.
Not sure if I'd return."}
{"text":"I normally only give above average reviews.  JC's is about a mile from our home.  We've had some bad service, not often enough to not go back and we've had some bad food but only because it wasn't our preferred choice.  We love the music and atmosphere.  Tonight (Valentines Day) we didn't make plans in advance because we just wanted to get a bite to eat and a couple of drinks.  So my husband called and specifically asked if we needed reservations to sit at the bar.  The answer was no but a limited menu was offered.  He really wanted the lamb and she told him that was still offered.  We got there and tried to walk to the bar along with another couple and a solo woman.  The hostess stopped us all and refused to let us in till the owner got there.  When she showed up she let the other 3 in because they only wanted drinks and we were told we couldn't eat.  My husband reminded her how he had called and she answered, well that was before and the kitchen can't handle it anymore.  The dining room maybe had 40 people and the bar had about 10 people (none of which were allowed to eat). We left and will not be back.  So we called Clever Koi and asked if there were openings at the bar they said yes and we were there in less than 5 min, got a full menu and awesome bar service and they were twice as busy as JC's."}
{"text":"I used to dine at The Groves and when I found out that Denis and Dianna opened this restaurant I knew that I just HAD to eat here! Walking through the doors you just are surrounded by an amazing ambiance! The entire place is gorgeous with chandeliers and sheet metal and brick walls-it is so urban chic! I got the sirloin steak with mashed potatoes and it was great! The service was absolutely phenomenal, the server knew all of the items on the menu and gave great options for anything I was not sure about. One of my pet peeves is having an empty cup and I'm happy to say that mine never went empty!  I went around closing time and they were more than happy to accommodate my me and my party of five-even staying late to get us dessert. I will absolutely be back here and I hope everyone enjoys the service and food as much as I did!"}
{"text":"So first time to this restaurant and understand why it had a three star. Close to our house so had to try. The food was great! Had the filet Oscar style not on the menu my wife had king crab and my son had the Mac and cheese with sausage. Appetizers to start was the artichokes and it was great!  Service was interesting. The waitress was nice but didn't no details of the menu in and outs. Was not supper attentive then you have some one grabbing a plate or asking every five seconds. Just strange vibe on the service side."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Gilbert. I will start by saying I am actually a chef by definition of a chef I actually worked under a Michelin 3 Star chef from les Belleville France for 9 years. I myself have 21 years of food service experience. Enough about me now on to the review which deserves to be seen by all who want to venture out and taste the most extravagant filet mignon and made from scratch deserts. It being my first time here was a very eventful night the live music was perfect to the ambiance and tone this place set for the night. I ordered a bottle of wine and the pork skins for starters. I can say I was not thrilled with the pork skins but this is my take on how my pallet works. They were the basic pork skins worn a hint of orange as being a dry food I would recommend a sauce of some sort to take the away from dryness but they were like I said basic and nothing to fret over. As my night went on I ordered the filet with loaded baked potatoe which I say the presentation of the meal was on point I love how they didn't throw everything on your baker and let you decide how much of what you wanted on it. The baked potatoe was not dry at all very plumped and cooked perfectly as for the vegetables they were perfectly well seasoned and sautéed just right crispy and not mushy. And as for the filet well I could not ask for a more perfect cut of meat cooked to perfection. By far the best filet I've had in a long time. There was no need to ruin it with steak sauce the garlic butter infusion used was perfect and very tasty. As most people do not understand how a steak is properly cooked can say medium is more like medium rare or medium more like medium well. You have to actually understand your steak temperatures to know how a steak is properly cooked to review how your steak was cooked if you had a not so pleasant experience. I can't see that happening here the chef who cooked my steak Dennis knows exactly what he is doing in that kitchen and having to meet this wonderful chef was a experience on its own. He truly shows the years of experience and culinary skills he has. For my dessert I chose the banana fosters it's very rare you find that kind of dessert ok the menu and when it came to the table I can see I was in for a treat. It has so much flavor and perfect portion of sauce and bananas which made it not overwhelming. As a kind gesture chef Dennis brought me out a piece of cheesecake which he made himself there and I will say that also was by far the best fluffy filling and very tasteful. I would have to say anything less then 5 stars will be insulting because this place can dish out a meal to the liking of a fellow chef and food critic. Hats off to you chef Dennis and your wonderful menu steak and restaurant. I will be returning there in the future and so on."}
{"text":"Had a family dinner here for my mom's birthday. Diana and team were great. Service was attentive, specialty items prepared to perfection--custom desserts and the evening's music was outstanding."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon Caesar salad, salmon came  raw in center, tasted extremely fishy, and was cold. I sent the salad back and was offered a new salad for which I declined. When the bill came I was charged for the awful salad but with a 10% discount (what a joke) I do NOT recommend this place at all, service was terrible and very slow!"}
