{"text":"Best bang for the bucks :) Great place for Lunch deals and family dinner. Good restaurants ambience in a budget"}
{"text":"I've been to Café Hollywood a few times. I've also been in City Hollywood as well, but I must say, City Hollywood is a lot better as they serve all their food whenever you want, so there's no specific time of when you can order it. Cafe Hollywood also does not a variety of foods for vegetarians (as City Hollywood does). For all the times I've been there, I've only ordered the french toast."}
{"text":"Third time here, figured the service would be different aka better? Great food, great price, great ambiance. Service is whackkkkkkkkkkkkkk. Servers seem so shy and generally, the service is too slow. Slower than usual waits  SERVICE SUCKSSSSS Can I give it a no star?"}
{"text":"Come here for the wings. The honey garlic ain't honey garlic. It's more like BBQ but whatever. It taste like good BBQ wings. Get the combo with ice tea or beer. Best bang for buck. Don't order anything else."}
{"text":"Korean style stone (hot) rice is good. Today is Saturday noon and they have full house."}
{"text":"Great place for quick cheap food. They don't actually have a lot of options but they have good (time sensitive) deals. One of my main go-to deals being the all day breakfast option for $5.99 which includes a choice of noodle soup + ham and eggs + bread with butter + coffee/tea. This newer location looks much nicer and is a bit bigger than its predecessor, but gets very busy at times so you can still expect a wait.  Kid friendly as they do have a couple of good kids' meals."}
{"text":"This is a HK Style restaurant with quite good food and value. Service is adequate. Portion is ok. I have ordered a Baked Fish Filet Rice. I found the sauce is a bit too light. My wife ordered    the Cantonese Fried Noodle which is a bit dry and the sauce is bit salty.   The decoration is cosy. I like the sense of humor of the decorator that inside the lobby of the Restrooms, it says \"Gentlemen, please take the LEFT as Ladies always have the RIGHT\" .   All in all, I think I will visit this joint again."}
{"text":"I got the lunch combo spaghetti Bolognese. It came with soup and bread. The bread was hard and the soup was watery. Spaghetti was decent. I couldn't finish the meal so I asked for a box and they charged me 25 cents for it. This is the first time I got charged in a restaurant for takeout box... Food wasn't good. I will not come back."}
{"text":"The first time we came was terrible because they lost our orders.    We gave the place another shot and it was much better.  The food is pretty good.    We like the wings here"}
{"text":"Standard hong kong style cafe. Located in the plaza of Pacific Mall so it usually very busy. Menu prices are fairly cheap and food is just ok. Ordered the curry beef which came with bbq pork and an egg. Curry didn't have much flavor, but honestly wasn't expecting much. Nothing special that would want me coming back here specifically. Good for when you need to eat something cheap and quick."}
{"text":"Customer service is awful. I ordered the all day breakfast that came with eggs and ham on the side. I asked for sunny side up, a simple request.. so I thought. When it came, the egg whites were more raw than cooked. We brought it to the waitress' attention and just asked if it could be cooked a little longer. She didn't even apologize, she just told us that's how sunny side up eggs were. A second waitress came and again told us the same thing but she did come back with new eggs... Slightly better than the first ones. TLDR: do yourself a favor, save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"AVOID AT ALL COST!! This place is only trying to rip you off!  I went with my family during the holiday season and all they had on there menu was $38.99 menu selection and nothing else. And what you get is plain steak and half of a lobster and disgusting salad.  They had a santa claus there that night who was the saddest being ever lived. He never once smiled, even when taking the pictures with the customers.  You can tell the owner does not treat there staff well and is only trying to squeeze every dollar out of everyone.  Avoid this place like the plague and do not go to there affiliated restaurants as well."}
{"text":"One star for nice interior and another star for the cheap price, that's it. The cafe is newly opened so we gave it a try. The menu is basically the same as the one at Pacific mall. I felt like the waitress always want us to hurry up and go even the restaurant is bearly half filled. We ordered the happy meal (with short ribs and chicken) and Portuguese style chicken and rice. Sorry it's an epic fail. As an asian restaurant they can't even cook the rice right, they put too much water to cook the rice. Short ribs were average but the chicken is just dry and overcooked. The Portuguese style dish there were more potatoes than chicken... and the soup and entree were luke warm when they were served, which is not quite pleasant.   But the price is pretty decent, u pay around $8 u get a drink, a soup and ur main course meal."}
{"text":"Greeted by friendly staff and ambience on my first visit at noon. My timing was perfect in terms of the lineup that followed 5 minutes later. I have been to this location when it was Burger King.  Decor is Hollywood style.  I had the Portuguese Chicken lunch special. The taste was perfect for me because of my reduced salt diet.  I will try the Malaysian Beef next time."}
{"text":"We went to Cafe Hollywood on a Wednesday night for dinner. I ordered the Mixed Grill dinner and my boyfriend had the curry beef on rice.   The borscht soup that came with my dinner was average.  Our waitress brought the salad together with the Mixed Grill after 10 minutes from the time I ordered. The salad had decayed greens and salad dressing spattered on the plate. I lost appetite of the salad just by looking at it. The Mixed Grill was terrible. I'm not even sure if the bacon was cooked. Rather than the normal thin cut steak that usually go with this kind of mixed grill was replaced with one sliced of beef rib.   The curry beef was bitter and extremely oily.   I will not recommend anyone to eat there. Not sure why this place is still in business."}
{"text":"Maybe closer to a 3.5?  This place is my go to place for a HK style breakfast. Their portion sizes are VERY fair for the price. I almost always order the All-day breakfast but their wings and fries are pretty damn good. The ambiance is much better and comfortable than the Market Village location.  My qualms with this restaurant is that the service is not the greatest, but it's not fine-dining so I can't expect more. During peak hours the place gets PACKED and the staff can't seem to keep up with the demand at times. Oh and you have to pay $0.25 for a takeout box.. Like come on.  Their HK milk tea is awesome though"}
{"text":"I prefer this location and almost always order the same thing: their famous Hong Kong styled chicken wings basket and a jug of ice cold Hong Kong style milk tea during the late afternoon.  20 pieces of deep fried crispy, succulent, tender chicken wings sit on a bed of crispy and fresh fries. This is served with a portion of gravy.  The other option is doing fewer wings but enjoying fishballs, onion rings, etc but i prefer just the wings.  The only downside is their $0.25 charge for a take out box so make sure you have at least 2 people to chow down on those wings."}
{"text":"I love the decor and the comfortable seatings of this place.   The quality of food is average and I find there is limited choices on the menu.   But Service was fast and friendly enough. And their prices are pretty good and you get a good portion.    I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Just get the wings. 20 wings with fries and a pitcher of whatever drink you want. Get Pepper chili flavour. Simple but tastes amazing. Best $22 of life. I would've gave it a 5 star if the waiters stopped talking in Chinese to me. I'm not even Chinese."}
{"text":"I don't know if I really should even review since every single time we go there we order the exact same thing.  We get the A basket of 20 wings and fries (HK style) and an order of the spaghetti bolognese.  The wings are always hot and seasoned well and yummy. The fries are my fave (they're kinda like the costco fries, if you know what I'm talking about). It comes with a tiny little dish of side gravy (we asked for more last time, which they gave to us for free...but I don't know if that's a usual thing). The spaghetti always hits the spot. We only get one to share between the two of us (they charge 25 cents per box if you want to take home your leftovers).  So if you're going for our order, it's yum. If you're not into wings and spaghetti, then maybe read someone else's review before you go..."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. It was pretty crowded and after we were seated they didn't give us menus so I went off to get them myself. Overall food portions were huge! It's a lot of food but pretty mediocre quality. One of the nice things is they have combos where you can get a soup with a bun, the meal, and a drink afterwards (cold drinks and presto tea are additional money). Problem is you have to flag down a person every time you need anything and more often than not they just completely ignore you."}
{"text":"Happy hour deal gives 1 star. Service is the worse I've ever had maybe lol. What service? I have to be a flag in a tornado to get any attention if I'm lucky. The waitresses slam food and drinks onto the table. The noodles my friend got he said tasted like they were overnight frozen or just highly under cooked. My wings were very good with the jug deal but the service is a killer... only will be back if close by and want beer with wings. Probably won't be back for a long time till the staff changes though. The 1 star goes to the chef for the excellent wings. Then again, its the recipe of the batter that gets the credit. No hard feelings hollywood, you used to be good."}
{"text":"Cheap breakfast! $4.50+ for breakfast combos! They open at 8am.  FYI Their original location at market village (Kennedy and Steeles) closed down, as with most things in that plaza due to the upcoming construction."}
{"text":"I used to go to the location nearby Pacific Mall, Village Market (if I weren't wrong). Pass by this place one time and wonder if this place is the same at City Hollywood Cafe. Give it a try today, walk in on Sunday 1 p.m. The place is full with people, a waiter comes along, take my name. Wait for about 10' and he asked if I'm ok to seat right beside the bar. I'm ok with it (2 guys). Food is exactly the same at the old place (a +). Service is fast (+). Price is fair (+). I also like this place because they are having bubble tea with I can order take-out for my wife. Will come back again with a group of friends next time."}
{"text":"Quality has gone down hill......   - Soup and tea/coffee not included with most main courses - Portuguese chicken rice only includes chicken with no complementing vegetables - Smaller portions served on large dishes look depressing and - French toast does not include peanut butter inside anymore.  There are better options nearby."}
{"text":"NEVER GOING BACK!!  Food tastes okay in general and in big portions. The environment is pretty clean and great. BUT! It's definitely not a restaurant with good services. In fact I personally experienced a terrible service.  They charge $0.50 for takeout boxes for unfinished foods. This sounds new to me but it was okay, $0.50 wasn't too much and most people would just leave it. But speaking of the attitude of one of the waitress when I asked if this is a new rule because I've never heard of this extra charge. She gave me a contempt look and replied in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable. In a tone that makes you feel like you're a FOB. I felt discriminated, however I still gave them tips. But the manager came out at the end and offered to give the $0.50 back!! Made me feel like I actually cared about that $0.50!!! Maybe they should start to realize their problem and their bad customer service before running out of business in this competitive and customer service emphasizing environment."}
{"text":"I often go to Hollywood but this was a very bad experience!!!!!!!!!! It wasn't bad before but this time was a really bad one!!!!!This made me wrote my first bad review of a restaurant!!!!! First, service was really bad. 6 servers were talking in the corner while we were waiting to order our meals. Plus, they did not give us enough cutlery. We had to ask them couple times for cutlery. The most ridicoulous  thing was we ordered Honey Garlic chicken wings. When the wings came, its nothing like honey garlic sauce. There was a side gravy (for fries) so I thought they might gave me the wrong sauce. So I asked \"are you sure thats honey garlic sauce?\" They insistly saying thats honey garlic....and the \"honey garlic\" tasted like ketchup with mild sauce!!! Okay fine. Not coming back again. AWFUL EXPERIENCE"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Its my favourite place to go to for take out and occasionally to eat in. They have a lot of delicious food for a pretty decent price. I love the chicken the most, the chicken basket is sooooo worth it and delicious, it cruchy and soft and the fries are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. They are absolutely amazing. The all day breakfast is also amazing, for $5.99 you get a TON of food. I also love getting the chicken during the noon time tea for $3.50 and the chicken is great and it come with chips. It's lovely how I can go there after school and buy food and bubble tea. The bubble tea isn't the best, I've definitely had better, but it's not bad. Overall, I definitely recommend it, the food is delicious and it's pretty decent in terms of price. You should definitely try the chicken at least!"}
{"text":"If I can give half star I would. Or negative star. I was a loyal customer for the market village location. After they merge, the food is smaller. The service horrible. No one is lining up and it takes 5 minute for us to get a seat. Food came real small with no sauce on it. The bubble tea came 20 mins later after we remind them 2 times. Really horrible quality and service. Will not recommend anyone to come"}
{"text":"Hollywoods been at Kennedy Rd for quite some time now and is probably one of the restaurants that I've been to the most in Markham.   They're Happy Meal special (which ends at 7pm) is probably 95% of the reason me and my girlfriend go. It comes with the two LARGE pieces of meat with either rice or noodles, soup, veggies and a small bun. The best part is it's only 8.99!! The unfortunate thing however, is that the rest of their menu after 7, has yet to intrigue us. We've tried some things but they've mostly disappointed.   One thing you can get after 7 is their wings which have seen a lot of good reviews and I can definitely attest to them. For $17 you get 20 wings (which are pretty big btw) fries under the wings along with gravy (how you use the gravy is up to you, I drink it after I'm done the fries). I always get the honey garlic and they always leave me completely full and satisfied!   I always recommend the Happy Meal to my friends and they always thank me for telling them about it, however besides the wings and the special, there's nothing I've liked as much. But will definitely still come again for one of those two!"}
{"text":"Been going to Cafe Hollywood since their original location. Great place to eat for late night. Service and food are fair. Lunch hour rush is brutal. The wait time is very long."}
{"text":"Don't like the white plastic dinnerware they are using to serve people for a $19 meal."}
{"text":"I didn't think it was possible but this poor excuse for an asian fusion hut with a tacky name  did it. On this very day, on Rememberance day, I will always remember that I had poorly made Baked Portuguese chicken rice. Lets not mention the amount of rice I was given, the sauce is what we need to talk about here. It was like they made a big batch of sauce then added water to save cost. Then it was like I had one good piece of chicken but the rest were scraps. I had my two friends taste it just to make sure it wasnt just me, and they both agreed.  They get one star for having a good choice in dinner buns."}
{"text":"Good casual place to just hang out and get a bite to eat.  Foodwise, nothing spectacular.  They do have lots of afternoon specials or late night specials for a good price. You can also get Prestotea here if you prefer that.  I had there afternoon tea korean beef noodle which was nothing special, just your usual instant noodle with a very chewy piece of beef and some frozen veggies.  Next time, I'll stick with the spaghetti bologonese which is a better option here."}
{"text":"Decor/Seating: plenty of seating (regular tables and booths) but can be taken up fast during lunch/dinner time. The decor is a modern sports bar feel, with plenty of flat screens to watch sports.  Cleanliness: 5/5  Service: Fast and accomodating  Food: Many HK cafe style options and combos that comes with a soup, tea/coffee. Best thing is that you can upgrade your drink to a Presotea bubble tea (they have good drinks). For a combo, you are paying about $10 to $12."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved back north the food game is STRONGGG!!   Can we just take a moment and appreciate the chicken wings here. FIRST they don't cost a leg and arm AND it's delicious... i'm sold. Purchase a pitcher of beer for $20.99 and add a bucket of 20 mixed wings and drums for $9.99, don't mind if I do. The wings are everything you want a wing to be. Comes out HOT and FRESH! You can choose a sauce... I highly recommend to ask for the sauce on the side. My favourite is the honey bbq. BOMB DOT COM. My best friend loves their gravy but it can be a hit or a miss. WAIT! Did I forget to mention that the wings comes on top of fries... yes.. and its the good breaded fries too! (As i'm writing this review while i'm on the subway, i'm literally drooling)  We also got the $9.99 special that comes with two choice of protein, a side of rice or spaghetti and a drink. We got the short ribs and the pork cutlet with black pepper sauce....   Honestly if my body was able to sustain eating chicken wings everyday, i would choose cafe hollywood chicken wings time and time again.   So happy my bestfriend showed me this place. See you sooner than later   Happy Eating :)"}
{"text":"This is the sister store of City Hollywood. The new location is nicely renovated with comfortable booth seating and long tables to accommodate big groups. Menu includes items such as: spaghetti, pork chop rice, noodles, and their ever popular chicken wings ($9.99 for 20 wings & fries with the purchase of a pitcher of drink of your choice). Good food, friendly staff, and great ambiance. Definitely a good place to hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I'm sad that they closed down the original location at Market VIllage. I always found it a little weird that both locations were open together for a long time. I usually always get the basket of chicken wings at Hollywood. The food is always A OK here. I would not say that it's amazing, but it's always good for the price you pay. You can get a basket of 20 wings for $19.99 or if you order a pitcher of beer, Coke, tea, anything you get the basket of wings for $9.99. I know that a pitcher of coke starts at $10.99, lemon tea is $13.99, or somersby is $22.99. The basket of wings also comes with some fries at the bottoms and gravy to dip. My favourite is the Hong Kong style wings."}
{"text":"Service:  Average Chinese cafe service.  Have to go to counter to use card (debit and credit accepted)   Food:  Bland and loaded with MSG.  Lunch special includes tea or coffee, soup (nasty), dish on rice (bland) and dinner roll (warm and soft)."}
{"text":"Should have stuck with my review after the first time. Hoping if I went more, my opinion would change but nope, still had a horrible experience.   First of all, the waiters are rude and not trained well. I went with a family friend last time and we had a large group of seven people but they squished us into a small table that is supposed to be for 4 people. (The ones by the window) Also, when we ask for water, tea, etc they completely forget and we have to ask more than once for someone to give us what we asked for. If their listening skills weren't enough, their attitude surely adds to it.   Secondly, the food is average. The portions seem worse than their restaurant at Market Village. The prices are alright for some of the meals but some you just get really ripped off by the shit they serve you. I also love it when they get your order wrong and act like it's not their fault.   Third, when you order a take-out meal, expect to not get the bread or soup. You only get a drink which sucks because I the only think I actually like about this place is the bread.   Of course, after trying three times at this location, I've learned that this Cafe Hollywood sucks. Not that the other one is better but they're both below average."}
{"text":"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe Cafe Hollywood is owned by the same people of City Hollywood? Judging by the replicated menu.  Here's my take on it. You want good food, you go to City Hollywood. You got a date or you're looking for a more spruced up place with more space and comfortable seating, you go to Cafe Hollywood. Call me crazy, and I know it's the same menu offerings, but the food tastes better at City Hollywood.  I've only been here once since I tend to go to City Hollywood, so I don't have much to say. I only come for the wings special which is always worth it, but for some reason, like I said before, it tastes better at City Hollywood.  There also seems to be an older crowd at this location too.  To be honest, Cafe Hollywood will only be my backup if City Hollywood is packed."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place is terrible. I've had HK style cafe food a lot, including in HK and while it's not the 'fancy' kind it's supposed to still taste food and be cooked thoroughly. I've been to that place at least 3 times and every time it was a disappointment. Last time I ordered Portuguese chicken and it looked undercooked. We asked to cook it more and even after that it still looked partially raw. Thankfully I didn't get food poisoning but definitely makes me not wanna go there ever again. Chicken wings that my friends ordered looked better so if you are to order something, I'd go for that."}
{"text":"HK Style Cafe with all the basic classics you would expect.   I went with a larger group of 6 and they were very accommodating for our larger group. We thought we had 5 people and squished in a booth (4 in the booth + 1 on the side) but had another friend join unexpectedly and the staff quickly helped us get setup at a larger table despite the large crowd.   I ordered one of their all-day breakfast combos which took a bit longer to serve (everyone was waiting for me even though some of them also ordered something similar). Overall, the food was good (the warm bread with butter was great) and we didn't feel rushed, which some HK cafes can make you feel, and we had a good overall experience."}
{"text":"Always like Hollywood for it's cheap eats. Cannot expect amazing quality but for what it is, it's pretty good compared to other HK cafes in the area.   I really enjoy their basket of fried chicken wings here. You get an option of ordering a pitcher of drink (alcohol, milk tea, iced lemon tea, etc) with the wings (20 pieces) or just wings and fries with their gravy sauce on the side.   My boyfriend and I usually enjoy dried wings especially when it comes to HK cafe style. They have other saucey flavours option as well. We tried the original and we also tried the pepper chilli flavour on two separate occasions. We both agreed that pepper chilli is the winner between the two. Pepper chilli is such a misleading name for that flavour in particular because there are absolutely no chilli in it and not spicy at all. It only consist of pepper (of course) and garlic bits; the combination of the two are quite delicious though.  All and all, we enjoy coming to Hollywood every so often."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for the wings and beer deal: 20 wings on a bed of fries with gravy on the side and a pitcher of beer (pabst) for about 30 bucks after tax. If you're craving the HK style food it isn't bad, the selection is small and the service is ok (when they can see you). Looks nicer in terms of decor for this type of place but in the area there are tastier options. I have never had to wait for a seat though which I can't say for some of the other restaurants that are similar."}
{"text":"They have a special deal of a basket of wings with a jar of beer cost $30. There are different flavours of the wings. There are Hong Kong style, salt and pepper and other styles. I ordered two baskets of wings and two jars of beer to share among four people. The wings inHong Kong style tasted very good.It really tasted crispy and the flavour was very similar to the deep fried chicken leg that was from Hong Kong Maxim Cafe. Somehow, the second basket of wings seems to have more wings and drumsticks.   The beer was icy cold. It went very well together with the deep fried wings.   Four people could not finish two baskets of fried wings and two jars of beer.  It would be nice if there are more tapas food on the menu."}
{"text":"Captivated by the cheap lunch sets, we decided to give this place a try. Only after did we check the Yelp reviews and sorely regret our decision.  I ordered the beef stroganoff set, which came with either rice or spaghetti, a hot drink, and a soup with bread and butter. My mom got the same thing, but with spaghetti, and my dad ordered the chicken curry. While the borscht soup was acceptable, and the sweet bread roll warm and soft, the actual meal itself was disgusting. The roux was unbelievably thick, likely due to all the cornstarch added in. The texture was nasty. The chicken curry had a very similar texture, with few pieces of chicken but lots of potatoes.   The service was horrible as well, with spiteful and unnecessary remarks from the staff. They shoved my sister's plate right at my dad when they were delivering the order, and continued to walk briskly by without a word.  The fried chicken wings were decent, but the fries were coated in the same batter and fried, giving it a weird texture.   Will not return, both due to the poor service and substandard quality of food."}
{"text":"Went here again with a large group of 12 people. We didn't make reservations so we had to wait about 15 min for a table.  They have pretty good deals at Hollywood I got all day breakfast which comes with a noodle soup, eggs ham bread and a drink for only 5.99!  It's a great deal. Also they have wing deals where you could add on a pitcher of beer for 9.99 or a pitcher of a cold drink (like milk tea, Ribena)  The service was alright too. Environment is pretty nice there with tvs so you could watch sports. Not too loud. Bright place. It's pretty packed usually but he turnover is fast.  Would come here again (all day breakfast ftw)"}
{"text":"We used to come here because of the value, but the food has always been mediocre at best. Now with the recent price hike, I don't really see why we would come here anymore. The rice portion recently has also been super small, and their milk tea is also not the best. I do like the decor and atmosphere, but I don't see why I would choose this over other places."}
{"text":"I will select negative 5 star if I can, never had the food like this in my entire life, we order three dishes, two of them were rice and the last one was toast, all of them were the worst food I ever ate."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I'm craving chicken wings. The deal is just too good with the drink jug special. You can get 20 wings with fries and gravy for $17 plus tax, or if you get a pitcher of any drinks then the wings, fries and gravy are only $9. Pitchers can go as low as $11-12 each for soda, so you essentially can get it all for around $22 plus tax!"}
{"text":"You have to come early for lunch (say before 11:30am) on weekends, otherwise it will be near impossible to get parking and even if you do, there will certainly be a lineup waiting for you. Other than that, everything else is okay. Decor-wise, food-wise, service-wise. The environment is cozy and clean with lots of TV if that's your thing (i.e. bar-like atmosphere)."}
{"text":"Service is not great and they try to charge you for basic items like lemon when other restaurants give them for free. Food taste was average. Not much items to choose from. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when their location at market village was still open. They have a wide menu variety with dinner, snacks, bubble tea, and alcohol. Their food is pretty cheap and in pretty big portions. This restaurant is very modern and big. They have a lot of seats but it can still get pretty busy during dinner time. They have a chicken wing and beer special every day starting at 1pm-close. The chicken wings are $20 for 20 wings, or you can order a pitcher of beer and get the wings for $10. The wings are classic hk style deep friend wings and it is delicious! They also have a small dessert menu and its a good place to hang out or grab drinks with friends late at night."}
{"text":"Substandard compared to their other location City Hollywood.  Waitress forgot to enter my order and was looking for someone to blame for her mistake.  Took an hour an a half to get my lunch.  2 rounds of people had come and gone before I got my food.  New waitresses (not the ones that got transferred over) need a whole lot of training before they should even be on the floor.  Temperature of the food was not hot enough and the rice had actually cooled down to room temperature.  I also caught the lady at the bar that makes all their beverages taste test a customer's cup of (I assume milk tea), before putting it on a tray for a waitress to bring to a customer.  Unacceptable.  I do not recommend anyone going to this place."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and though I was impressed in the beginning, everything got progressively worse with each visit. I think a large part of it is that the more experienced waiter ladies are now nowhere to be seen and are replaced by younger waitstaff who despite their best efforts lack experience. But my last visit will be my final visit and here's why:  1)My mom ordered off the all day breakfast menu and specified she wanted the vermicelli option. The waitress replied \"macaroni?\", and my mom corrected her. And repeated herself to ensure that it was clear she wanted vermicelli. The words vermicelli was said clearly and distinctly 3 times. It came in macaroni. Usually my mom would be like w/e, but this is the first time I've seen her adamant about correcting the mistake just because she emphasized what she wanted so many times.  2) This is the large portion of why I will not be back. At this point both my parents dishes have arrived and I've been waiting a long time. When my dish finally arrived (curry beef with rice) I was really disturbed. I can clearly see stains from a previous dish on my plate. It was clear it's a different dish cause the sauce stains were an entirely different colour from the curry. At this point I didn't want to bother sending it back since my parents were basically done eating and since we've already sent one dish back I was concerned that if we sent another one we'd just piss off the kitchen staff and have something bad happen to my replacement dish anyways. So I just tried to eat the stuff that didn't touch the plate. I couldn't even enjoy that cause the curry was terribly salty and I really just couldn't finish the dish.  As cheap as cafe hollywood is, it's just not worth the aggravation.I wish they had maintained the quality of their early days but clearly something has went terribly wrong."}
{"text":"Right now this moment I am eating at  cafe holly wood  while doing this review.  This restaurant is definetly the same as the market village one.  But it seems like they have changed the menu a bit.   As for the food, I ordered spaghetti bolognaise and the taste was exactly the same as the market village one. Although the chicken wings that we ordered seemed to still have feather stuck in it. Which was slightly unappetizing.  Also IMO it is not worth it to add $1 extra for 10 fries. Might aswell grab some fries from McDonalds.   For the service, yes they took awhile to notice us at the door, but as soon as seated everything was better than I thought. Except the chicken wings took awhile to arrive.   Overall I will give them a 3star just because it wasn't that bad.  Also the decoor isn't bad and feels pretty cozy so its definetly worth a try !!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place for a cheap HK-style afternoon tea. The French toast with ice cream is good, but doesn't come with peanut butter. On the savoury side, the chicken wings are flavourful and juicy, and the spaghetti bolognese is OK. The milk tea comes in a pretty small cup, so it isn't the most satisfying.   Service is quick, and there are big TVs everywhere, so if you want to watch sports or ignore your relatives this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Came here for their happy meals but forgot that a lot of their meals are only served during specified times :( so the menu becomes very limited after 7pm which I don't really like. Love their wings and generally will order a basket. Really wish they served their meals all day and not just do all day breakfasts."}
{"text":"Came here one day on the weekend and it was packed! Luckily we were able to get a spot pretty quick. Typical HK style restaurant and good for its cheap eats! I had the Portuguese chicken with pasta and my bf had the curry chicken with rice. They provide free soup and free drink including tea and coffee depending what dish you order. Food quality is alrite, not the greatest but you don't really expect much in a HK food type restaurant. I would go back here on occasion when I'm feeling for a nice cheap eat lunch! Service is alright I can see how hard the servers work. I think it would help if they have more staff."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place existed, yet I must have drove by it a million times! Like your other HK style cafes, this one had about the same vibe, but maybe not as good as the ones I typically go to.   Decor was quite nice, with very modern decorations, and interesting lighting throughout different areas of the space. A bit funny in terms of the general area, as it used to be a Burger King, so the drive through is no longer in use.   The menu was a little limited in my opinion, with not a large variety to choose from. I ended up settling on something rather than really wanting something.  I ended up getting the Malaysian Beef Curry, and my friend got the Twins meal with Pork Cutlet and BBQ Pork.  The curry was a nice consistency, but not the best curry I've had. The beef in it was just regular slices of beef, which was a little disappointing. The Pork Twin meal was a little better, as the cutlet was quite good, but the bbq pork was way too skinny, to the point where it was chewy and tough to get through.   Prices were reasonable, and the service was quite quick and friendly, but the food was their downfall. Probably won't come back as there are definitely better places down the road."}
{"text":"Won't be returning even though I live minutes away. As far as Asian afternoon tea restaurants go, this place is subpar.   We went for afternoon tea once and weren't impressed with the menu. I can't remember if it came with a soup, but I ordered a baked rice dish. Whereas the rice in other restaurants' baked dishes is fried rice (with eggs), Cafe Hollywood's dish came with plain white rice, which was disappointing and really brought the quality of the overall dish down.  Most recently, we went there for dinner to give the place another shot. I ordered a different baked rice dish (clearly my thing) - Portugese-style baked coconut chicken rice - and think it was plain white rice as well. It was harder to tell because the restaurant is slightly dim and the sauce was yellow, so it was difficult to distinguish between yellowed rice due to sauce or eggs. Either way, it didn't taste or look like it had eggs in it.  The dinner dish also didn't come with a soup or drink, which I found strange by Asian restaurant standards.   In general, the food was very mediocre and we won't be returning, which is a shame because I have fond memories of its Market Village counterpart."}
{"text":"Since the Market Village location closed, this location has been very busy. I enjoy eating here for the atmosphere and there are also a lot of options on the menu. I've tried a lot of their grilled meats special combos (ex. Pork chop on rice, mixed grill, short ribs, etc.). Their wings baskets are good too. On a recent visit, I tried the Twins Combo: Curry beef with rice + BBQ Pork & Egg. The curry beef was good, the typical curry you get at a Chinese cafe. The BBQ pork on the other hand, was bland and had no taste whatsoever. I really didn't expect this... We also spoke to the waiter and he even said that the BBQ pork is bought outside the restaurant and not made fresh. I'll definitely come back, but I just won't be getting the BBQ pork anymore. Besides this, it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Most horrible customer service ever. Their only saving grace is their wings and fries basket. If you get a pitcher it's worth it because the basket becomes 11.99 instead of 16.99. But back to the service. The wait staff is rude. None of them are courteous at all. When we first came in it was decently filled so we had to wait a little bit for them to come serve us. But when our waiter came he gave us so much attitude for no reason. We weren't even rude to him. We might have changed our decision on the flavour of the wings last minute but that was it and he shook his head at us? What even warranted him to do that. We finally get our wings and we wondering where the other basket was as we already finished the first basket and this other wait staff yelled across the restaurant to see what we needed. Finally we leave and we pay the bill and this other server had the audacity to ask for more tip. So rude. If we felt like they treated us well then we would have tipped better. We gave the standard and she asked for more."}
{"text":"Average Hong Kong style and Asian fusion kinda cuisine. There are definitely some worthwhile options that are more about the value than quality in itself. Notably, one can get 20 wings for $10, including a pitcher of Coke or Beer. As well, there are different set dinners ranging from $8 to $16, which include the typical soup, and free beverage (milk tea or Hong Kong style Coffee). The food itself is alright, and nothing more, but good service!"}
{"text":"They make everything cheap and that's what you get cheap food. The meat was chewy and I guess they have to cut ends to give low prices. Wouldn't really recommend since the quality is just that bad. The only attraction would be the presto tea."}
{"text":"Came here to catch one of the Blue Jays game a while ago. Their Tv cut out on one of the most pivotal innings. Although their milk tea and value food items are good, it will never compensate me for missing the last part of the game.   Also, they don't have their liquor licence, so no beers here (despite their menu saying otherwise)!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation, but we still had to wait awhile anyways, and it's not surprising because seating is limited, lines are huge, and there aren't that many large tables set up.   Interior has nice decoration. Lots of movie posters and TV's. Washrooms are ok.  We came specifically for their daily wings deal: $16.99 for a basket of 20 wings after 1 PM. Only $9.99 if you make it a combo with a jug of milk, or other drink of your choice like beer, or milk tea, or some carbonated option.  They have 6 different flavours to choose from. They recommend HK style (no dressing) and honey garlic, so we ordered those two along with two drinks; of course, one of which is soy milk. Soy milk was a bit too sweet for me but perhaps that is the HK style? I don't know.  Each basket comes with fried wings, potato fries, and a bowl of gravy. They give you so much gravy that it is unclear how you would even finish it. Is it for the fries? Or the wings themselves? I do like the gravy.  Wings were ok. I liked them. The neat was hot and tender, the skins were very crispy. Others didn't like the honey garlic as much but perhaps that is because they were expecting something closer to honey garlic from toher places; if you pretended that you had no idea was honey garlic tasted like, it might be a bit more enjoyable, though it was still not as good as just naked wings or the garlic chili pepper if you like a little spice (and actual garlic)  It's not a bad place for wings, if you don't have specific sauce preferences. I'm a fan of naked wings, and it fits the bill.  Did not order any other foods, so cannot say whether they're good or not. Their portions were definitely large though as they were brought to other tables, and you're looking at under $10 for a filling meal."}
{"text":"I heard this use to be place located in Mississauga but they moved to Markham. Came here late at night for a snack and wow it was crowded for 10pm! Seating took longer than usual since we came in a big group and had to be separated. Coincidentally they have a menu for people that come after 10pm and I got my filling.  I ordered a Japanese Chicken Noodle in Soup and it came with HK style milk tea. If you want quick, cheap, delicious food, I'd recommend coming here."}
{"text":"This review is solely for their Happy Hour wing basket deal, because that's what I came here for and it was pretty friggen awesome!  Starting at 1pm for $16.99, you get a basket of 20 deep fried chicken wings of a flavour of your choice and fries with gravy. My boyfriend and I ordered the HK style wings and they were amaaaa-zing. Fried to near perfection, the skin was crisp, the meat was juicy and tender, and the wings were served to us sizzling hot. The fries also did not fall short of that description and were fried to a delicious and soft crisp."}
{"text":"Since their 2 locations combined into one, menu changed. The special combo before 7pm is no longer available; instead, they increased the price from 7.99 to 9.99 and the portion became smaller."}
{"text":"Okay so, I've read different reviews about this location and to be quite frank, you get for what you pay for. I understand that they have made it a lot nicer than the market village location, however, it is still a HK style cheap eat out. I mean c'mon they serve instant noodle noodles for breakfast!  I guess in general, I cannot comment about the dinner service but I can comment on the breakfast service they provide there. I always go eat breakfast here on the weekends because 1. it is cheap, 2. it is conveniently located by my house and 3. it isn't by the zoo (aka pmall) where all the animals live.   I always get the same thing which is the breakfast combo. you get your choice of noodles in soup, 2 eggs, a bun, ham and minimal vegetable garnish lol. I usually order the passion fruit lime that comes with aloe vera and basil seeds. Although it is REALLY sour, at the same time I love it and it's really refreshing (definitely a plus in the summer time).   The only dinner I've had there was take out and I ordered their baked spaghetti in the red meat sauce WITH cheese (everything tastes better with cheese). I have to say, I am a huge pasta fan so maybe I am biased but it wasn't as if it was bland or tasteless.   I love simple things and maybe that's why I love this place so much because they're not trying to be anything else. Maybe the decor is portraying that vibe, but the food isn't a 5 star chef inspired menu and people (look at how they are dressed) are dressed casually. They're not there trying to impress you with their boobs and ass. It's a mom and pop family HK style restaurant where the service is friendly and people are actually nice. To each their own."}
{"text":"My husband recommended this place since I wanted to try something new. The decor is really neat. I quite enjoy the look of this place. They have a fanatic sign that reads. A meal without wine is called breakfast something that I truly believe in... well except when in europe. Then it's beer all day eryday.  Anyway on to the place. The food is good I got the all day breakfast and it came fast. The place wasn't too busy so the food came quick. My husband had the pork chop rice. Not bad!   Think they really try to cater the younger kids in this atmosphere. They have a 9.99 combo that's 20 wings and a jug of beer. That is a hell of a good combo!   I'm going to to come back and try that.   They also serve bbt here which is great. I loveeee my bbt.   Must come here!"}
{"text":"On this visit, I was starving and craving for their 20-wings combo.  This was what I ordered right away upon sitting down.  There were so many people in the restaurant on a weekday afternoon!  They must have been there for the afternoon tea time combos.  The place was packed and full of life.  My mom ordered the curry ox tongue with rice.  This was part of their regular menu and not part of the afternoon tea time one.  My Pepper Chili Chicken Wings arrived!  It looked the same as previous visits with 20 wings (mostly of drumsticks instead of wing parts) with crispy fries underneath the pile and a dish of gravy.  It was just as delicious as I remembered it from before.  Mmm, fried chicken wing craving seriously satisfied!  It was so good.  The Curry Ox-Tongue Rice arrived with the curry separate from the rice and veggies.  The curry had a very strong green curry spicy flavour.  There was way more curry than rice so the ratio was a bit off.  To that end, we finished the rice at the restaurant but took the remainder of the curry sauce home.  We also took the remainder of the chicken wings home too; it was a lot for two people!  When my next fried chicken craving comes, I might come to Cafe Hollywood once more. :')"}
{"text":"Hmm, not very impressed tonight.. It was super busy and the place was packed, so I didn't get much attention from the servers. That's understandable because the place was full, but that shouldn't affect the quality and freshness of the food. Took a look at my fiancé's salad that came with her meal and I was completely put off. She made it sound nicer by saying the salad looked \"sad\".. But to me, it looked like it was dehydrated/hungover and ready to vomit. The soup was also a problem tonight, which was unfortunate (for us -_-). All the veggies looked \"dehydrated\" too, even in the darn soup. That's just sad.. to another level.  Saving grace? Her steak.. It was the only thing done right, and my pasta. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere. Service could be more pleasant. Food was pretty good. Took a little long for the wings to show up but when it did, it was satisfactory. Booth seats are perfect for if you have a car seat. Washrooms are small. Only one person capacity. Disappointing. Word of advice...if you plan to take left overs home they charge 25 cents per take out box!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Hollywood is the offspring of City Hollywood, which located near Market village down the road. It's the same menu and everything but I like this location better than the Market Village one mainly because it is newer, bigger and more modern. What I do miss from the market village location was the cute comics at each booth.  Cafe Hollywood is bright and better lit with natural lighting. The service is just as fast and welcoming. It is one of the nicer asian cafes. I went in there alone a couple of times and they asked if I wanted to sit at a big table and share but I told them I preferred a booth and she didn't give a judgement sigh or anything like other places would have. She simply asked if it was okay to wait a couple minutes because someone was paying. Pretty good service for an asian restaurant. Other asian places would have rolled their eyes and muttered something in Chinese.   The service is quick, food within 10 minutes. Depending on what you order, you always get your soup within minutes before your meal. I do prefer the milk tea over other places. I like how when you order the cold milk tea they give you the sugar on the side so you can adjust it yourself. Most places mix the sugar into the cold themselves and it's always too sweet for me.   Overall if i was craving a quick Chinese cafe style food I always think of Hollyood first.  The parking here is way better than the market village location for sure."}
{"text":"Seriously!! I'm here right now. So angry at this place. I walked in at 10:00pm on a Wednesday night ... There are so many open seats a whole row of tables and not one waiter paying attention to us. It's now 10:40pm we just got seated when there were so many open seats. Ridiculous!! There is 1 waiter whose a guy whose pulling his weight by waiting the tables, working the bar and serving the drinks. He's doing everything ... all the other waiters are useless. They simple see us and pass us at the entrance door.   Now we waited another 20 minutes just to get a menu? Omg I'm not kidding this has been the worst service in my entire life. Now I'm sitting here for another 15min trying to locate a server to take our order. Im liteeally waving my hands in the air being ignored or passed by the workers. I'm ready to up in leave after wasting 1 whole hour here with no one to serve us. I would give this place ZERO STARS right now if I could. I'm a pretty honest yelper and this is my honest opinion. If you want to be ignored and given bad service ... come here. Otherwise someplace else would appreciate your business elsewhere... I just have NO WORDS for this place other then \"please train your servers better!!\" So disorganized."}
{"text":"I still remember years ago this location used to be a Burger King. Everytime, I come to Cafe Hollywood, it reminds me of good old memories. Not only the wings are cheap, for about a little over $20 you can a full basket of wings and can add jar of beer or interesting pop like Ribena with sprite. Very good price. The Alfredo sauce with chicken and ham is not too salty.   Ambiance is nice and comfy. One thing to note they can add more snacks such as fishballs, tofu, for late night snacks to increase the variety of the late night menu."}
{"text":"When I heard that Cafe Hollywood was expanding to another location, I was hoping that at least there would be a massive upgrade in decor and interior design. Boy, was I in for a nice surprise.   In terms of the decor, it is a nice change up from the interior design of its original location in Market Village. This location maintained the restaurant's name with its homage to movies and Hollywood in general with all different movie posters all around the restaurant.   For the food, I always come to Cafe Hollywood for the Afternoon Tea Specials, whether be at this or the original location. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality and quantity for each menu item in the afternoon tea special. I would definitely recommend French Toast, Fried Chicken Wings with Fries, Pan Fried Porkchop in Bun, and Korean Gyoza in Ramen if there is difficulty in deciding in what to try.   The drinks are pretty decent in terms of quality. The Hong Kong Style Milk Tea has a lot of body, smoothness, and flavour, things to look out for in every good HK Style Milk Tea. This location has expanded their drink selections to include bubble tea , courtesy of Preso Tea.   The service I have had at this location has been decent so far, as the waiters were very attentive towards every request I had. The waiters were very warm and kind whenever I enter the restaurant looking for a place to sit down.   Overall, nothing much in terms of the food has changed in this new location. The decor is a nice new fresh touch towards the younger generation of the Markham area. I definitely will be coming to this location more often for my afternoon tea fix."}
{"text":"Came here a few minutes before 7pm on a Friday night and got seated immediately. However I had a tough time flagging down a sever to take my order. I had $8.99 steak/chicken in black bean sauce, that came with a side of rice, vegi, cream soup and dinner roll. I found the steak really tough, but everything else was excellent. Great value, left really full, just don't choose the steak!"}
{"text":"Food arrives within 7 mins but they forgot our drinks! Staff are friendly compared to most Asian restaurants and it's clean here! I love how they give a bun-so soft!"}
{"text":"I used to frequent their old location in Mississauga so was excited to check this one out. Serves typical HK cafe food like baked pork chop and Portuguese chicken with rice or spaghetti. Tasty sauces, hot (temperature) food and quick service. I like they have many options for drinks like Presotea, HK tea and even alcohol.   I don't have high expectations for service at this type of restaurant, but they have quite a few younger (\"high school age\") wait staff who brought the wrong food (twice!) and spilled hot drinks. Two of the older ladies kept things in line.   Deep fried items seem to be their specialty: chicken wings, pork chop, fries etc.   Quite busy on a Saturday even at 5:30pm. Good thing we made a reservation.   Washroom both men's and ladies had broken sinks and stalls. Not great when the restaurant is so full and busy."}
{"text":"Came here for the 1st time after the restaurant has moved from their Market Village location. Glad to say this was a wise business decision. Venue wise, they took over the Burger King's building and it looks so much cleaner, more spacious and it isn't run down at all. So venue for me is good.  As for the food, can't say much for HK Style cafe food. I ordered a \"Twins\" combo meal and I was full. My friends and I pretty much ordered the same thing off their menu. So this place doesn't win you on like the high quality cooking skill but rather they win you on quantity and speed. Must try their wings though, they look amazing."}
{"text":"Hey Cafe Hollywood! I gave a 1 star when you first started and I returned to give you another chance. Instead, you gave me food poisoning from your meat sauce and rice splatter. You owe me 2 sick days from work. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"This place is blessed. Good food, good portions, good price. I come here on the weekly"}
{"text":"Cafe Hollywood is a place where you would go for late night food or simply just for a simple cheaper meal.  Their late night wings baskets are pretty decent for a night out with friends when you want to get something fried to eat. Their wings are fried decently and the meat inside is usually juicy. Other than that, the fries are like Costco fries so they taste like your good crispy store bought but satisfying fries.  I also like to get their all day breakfast meals as it is relatively cheap and you get decent portions. Nothing special about the food but it does keep you full and the quality of the food is good. They serve presto tea here as well, so if you like their bbt it's a bonus as you can get it with your meal with an upgrade price."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time, and moved to this new location a few years ago. I remember trying to many years ago and it was very unremarkable. Unfortunately not much has changed in terms of food. The interior design is a lot nicer, and the environment is well designed. However i have to say that the food is just as unremarkable as before. The cream soup that came with the meal , had no real taste, it was simply water down cream soup. and the Fish with cream corn sauce, is well just the soup with more corn starch. Overall There isn't much for me to say in regards to the taste of the food. since it is below average at best. The price is not bad at this place, however i am disappointed considering all the hype people have placed on it, and on top of it, the fact that it is actually quite a busy restaurant.   i would say people around the area, could try it, but dont' expect the moon. it is definitely not great for food. But interior decoration wise is okay."}
{"text":"Been here several times to try different items on the menu. My suggestion is to only come here for wings and drinks... everything else on the menu is just really mediocre HK Cafe style food.   The wings are amazing and they're only $20 for a huge basket of ~20 wings. Another good thing about this place is that they're always playing the big sporting events (NBA, UFC, etc).   The restaurant is decently clean and service is quick. The bathrooms are disgusting though."}
{"text":"The food is decent for a cafe.  When the bill came I put my credit card out and was informed the entire system was down and they could not accept any cards (ie it became cash only).  As I did not have enough cash, I had to go across the street where I got hit with the banks service charge and my own banks service charge. ($4.50 to get $20).  That was certainly not pleasant.  A warning would have been nice (I was informed it was down for 2 hours yet I saw them just put up some sign at the door a few minutes prior...).  The waiter was apologetic about it though...  Also extra charge for takeout which I agree that it's fair."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast the past week. Was not impressed with the service and quality of food. The workers were warming buns bought from the store with no gloves what so ever and touching other stuff thereon after /before, not sanitary. The food is very simple for breakfast (chicken,beef satay noodle soup) you can add an egg,ham and bun for an additional $2. Most likely won't be back .."}
{"text":"There's a new location for this restaurant where the old burger King was on Kennedy.   I usually come here for the happy hour which ends at 7pm, where you can pick 2 protein (chicken, steak, beef ribs) with rice or spaghetti, and includes soup, bread and a drink for 8.99.   Today I came a little later at 7:15 and couldn't order it so I had to order off the menu. The new menu is so limited.  They have a few pages.  Lunch special.  Dinner special (with 7 choices), afternoon tea special, midnight special, kids menu, all day breakfast and chef special.. So if you come at dinner.. You only have the dinner specials or chef specials. If I wanted to get an egg sandwich I wouldn't be able to.. If I wanted a bowl of noodles with pork chop I wouldn't be able to.   I got the all day breakfast special with 2 sausages, 2 eggs, ham and toast.  But instead of serving me toast for the breakfast, they serve a dinner roll.  Can't complain about the price at 5.99.  My boyfriend got the Portuguese chicken rice, it didn't have any vegetables, just rice, sauce and some pieces of chicken (some which had some soft bone).  That was for 7.95 on its own.  I will only come back for the happy hour special, otherwise this menu is so limited and all the pages practically have a time restraint.  Bring back the old menu from the old Hollywood place!    On the positive side, they paired up with presotea so you could pay a surcharge to have a bubble Tea with your meal (provided it comes with a drink.. Lol)"}
{"text":"Eh.  Came here on a Sunday around 9PM for dinner, and the place wasn't so packed. I believe they get busier after 10PM.  No one was there to greet us, though there were many tables empty, I only saw one server on site.  It took us a few minutes until someone finally came and seated us.  I asked if I could order one of the items in their Midnight menu that starts at 10PM, though it was only a bit after 9PM, and the server said 'Yes' I can order them, but I won't get the free coffee / tea with the combo of $4.99, and that was fine by me.  I got the $4.99 French toast with Ice cream, and my BF got the garlic porkchop with rice and gravy. That combo cost $12+ and it comes with soup and a drink. $1 extra for cold drink.  So when the food came, they gave me a French toast with no ice cream, so I had to get a server to get the correct order and the food came back with the ice cream on top that I ordered in 1 minute. That was good, very tasty.  Porkchop with rice and gravy was also very good, and the price is pretty good for what you get.  This will most likely be the last time I go here, as there are wayy to many better options in the area, especially if I am craving Chinese / Hongkong Style food.  Review 1 of 100"}
{"text":"Mediocre service is balanced out by great value chicken wings and afternoon tea specials, plus they have televisions up playing sports games, which is a nice touch for a Hong Kong style cafe.  Afternoon tea time is when they got some solid deals: $5.50 for a noodle soup with pork chop is a cheap, quick eat in a good environment with friends (provided you come with other folks. I have to say I'd never come here on my own.)  The 20 chicken wings combo is good value too (price depends on what drinks you get with it).  The quality is alright. It's not what you're looking for if you are thinking of a fancy dinner - remember, this used to be Burger King - but for an evening or afternoon out with friends, why not?  They also have a solid drinks menu between bubble tea and beer; something for everyone!  Environment is dimly lit, and in the theme of Hollywood, they got these Oscar trophy-esque statues outside."}
{"text":"My go to place for wings in the GTA area as it is a HK cafe. The atmosphere is nice with large televisions in sight at any table and angle. It can get busy during lunch hours when their afternoon specials are in effect. Their combos are well portioned and will fill the average person quite well. This location is not too far from their old one which is quite surprising as I thought they would serve a different community to boost sales. But I have to say that since they made the menu smaller and the new renovation beats the old one."}
{"text":"Came here on an evening during the weekend. As expected it is pretty busy so expect to have to wait a little bit. The place is decorated well to match their theme, and is comfortable to be in.  We got the basket of HK style chicken wings and they were delicious. It was a really good deal - $9.99 with the purchase of a pitcher of anything. The chicken was fried fresh, and they did a really good job with the \"HK style\" prep/taste of the wings. It's a decent portion and comes with some gravy. I wish there was a bit more french fries that came with it - it seemed like there was maybe 20 fries thinly lining the bottom - but for the price, whatever.   I really like how the combo works with non-alcoholic pitchers too. This is great for those who do not drink at all, or do not feel like drinking a whole pitcher with dinner.   I did not really have any issue with their service. It is what I expected in these styles of restaurants - if you want something you just need to be more assertive (like getting the bill). The servers are busy, so they don't have time to carefully watch your passive gestures if you want something.    The other stuff looked really good on the menu too, and is very well priced. I'm hoping to come back to try the other dishes too at some point."}
{"text":"At first I was confused at the location of this restaurant, I thought this was the same one near Pmall/Market Village. So after finding out this was a different location I was pleasantly surprised, the decor is cute with the giant trophies outside. I like when restaurants actually commit with their decor to their restaurant theme. The restaurant is nice, well lit and spacious with lots of seating available. The staff are sociable and pleasant. I found the washrooms and overall restaurant clean. They have a lot of menu options along with set meals which we all went with. They come with a drink + soup + bread. They also offer bubble tea too that are another brand though. Their 2 meat special was what most of us ordered, minute steak + their pork chops were really good. I'm more partial to their black pepper sauce over the gravy. If you want a different drink other then the included coffee/milk tea then it will be extra $. The only negative I found was their honey garlic chicken wings were not a favourite, tasted like they used sweet and sour sauce on them. Not all the wings were sauced either, they just poured it on top. Not ordering that again.  For the portions and the price definitely adding this to my favourites whenever we are in the area for next time."}
{"text":"As far as cheap eats go, this is pretty awesome. I got their club sandwich (slice of white bread, BLT, slice of white bread, egg and ham, slice of white bread = a two layer sandwich) for $4.95 and it came with fries. The sandwich was pretty good. There was a decent amount of bacon in it. The fries were really crispy. Tea got refilled quite often. Good stuff. I'll probably be back in the near future."}
{"text":"Food is average as usual. People come here for wings and beer because it's pretty darn cheap.  I've been here three times and it's honestly just gotten worse each time. There is a new bone I'd pick at every time I came. It's unfortunate because I do like the concept and location.  So when I went, my mom and I had to wait for 7 min for staff to validate our existence. And it wasn't even at the hostess table. A staff yelled across the dining area \"HOW MANY\" in Chinese. Whoo wee.  I ordered lamb chops. I figure you can't mess up lamb and also it was $11.50 so it was a sweet deal. I mean not really but it was worth if you're into lamb.  Lamb was relatively dry despite the black pepper sauce. Taste wise, it was fine, but the texture was def too dry. It was also super salty so I had to chug a gallon of water.  Come only if you have lots of time to spare. Flagging down someone for service require so much effort that you would burn away half the calories you ate there.  Also, their quality was not consistent. I didn't go to this place three times because I'm a masochist. They need more staff and their food quality needs to be more consistent to bring me back."}
{"text":"Finally, my in-laws took me to another location to eat in Markham! Its only been two years, could they possibly be growing tired of Congee Queen or Century Palace?   Actually it turns out we had my parents visiting and they wanted to take us somewhere to have coffee. Cafe Hollywood is a fun place. It feels like...a Milestone's style restaurant, but with a lot of TV screens with sports on, and the menu is more akin to a all-day breakfast place. The prices are so reasonable, we are talking $5 for a sandwich and hot coffee? Can't really go wrong. There is a lot of fried foods. Overall I wouldn't come here hoping for fresh salads and light meals. Its more of a stop-by-anytime type of place where you can hang out with friends to chat over coffee and snacks, without feeling like you have to rush to clear the table. Its definitely much cooler venue than your run of the mill Tim Horton's or Starbucks."}
{"text":"The place is not a bad Hk cafe. Milk tea can honestly use more milk, the tea is not smooth at all. I love how they have all day breakfast and their breakfast is totally worth every penny. You get 2 eggs, ham, a slice of tomato n cucumber, a bun and the bowl of soup noodle. And you get a drink too!!!   For dinner we had the lamb loin: there were so much access fat that it made the dish really difficult to cut through to the meat.  The multi steak dinner had ribs, chicken and a pork loin? That plate was huge but changing 1$ extra for all veggie is not good cause those are just mixed frozen greens that I can get at the supermarket for $1-2 for a Whole Pack! Can't they serve actual veggies like other restaurants, asparagus, carrot sticks, wedges!?!?!?  My friend devoured her bake fillet spaghetti, it must be really good or she was starving?!?! She didn't say it was great so im gonna assume that it was ok.  Her friend had the ox tongue rice. They had quite a few pieces of ox tongue! I'm happy and the next time I go I'd like to have it too.  Their drinks too way to long to come out I ordered and honey lemon water and my boyfriend had a coffee. I was surprised that my drink came out before his coffee. Unless they were making a new brew I don't understand by it took them 10-15 mins to get our drinks...  It's so really had to get the waiters attention."}
{"text":"Very generous portion sizes for price being paid. You definitely get more than what you pay for. We ordered the breakfast combos and got noodle soup with the traditional egg and ham style breakfast on the side. Would definitely come back. Fast service as well!  22/8/15: Just went here again for dinner and experienced terrible service. Server had a very monotone expression, and did not even provide a greeting. Instead, we were given a nod that would assumably indicate a \"you can state your order now\". Afterwards, we had asked for both a glass of water and hot sauce from two seperate servers, but both had forgotten. When we asked a third server, that is when we finally had gotten what we asked for. Food was still reasonable priced however in respects to portions. It was however also shocking that we were going to be charged an extra $1 just to have our hong kong tea cold rather than hot."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollywood = childhood, because it came from market village (city hollywood). Same menu, same prices.. same service.. One thing that has improved a lot is the decor- it's more modern, with comfy booth seating and the 'hollywood' theme with the wall decorations and huge oscar statues outside.   On weekend evenings and lunches, this place is jam packed. Tons of asians squished into a little restaurant in hopes of getting some cheap food. Makes me want to just leave the place, but they're usually pretty fast with sitting everyone down. I love their all day breakfast. SO much food for $6!? Yes please. I always get the satay beef with vermicelli. Yumm. It comes with a hot drink + any style eggs + pieces of ham + a sad excuse for a salad (one leaf, one cucumber slice and one tomato slice). It always gets me full so no complaints. I've recently tried the infamous chicken wings in HK style and I think they're pretty yummy! It's $16.99 for 20 wings, which is not a horrible deal as st. Louis's wings are much smaller and 1lb is only around 8 wings for $12.   The service is usually quick, except one time it took them forever to sit me down because they didn't even notice me standing at the door. The servers tend to speak canto to you and they bring everything very efficiently and they even apologize for stuff they mess up on- unlike a lot of asian restaurants.  I would come back."}
{"text":"I always come here for their chicken wings. Starting at 1pm for $16.99, you get a basket of 20 deep fried chicken wings of a flavour of your choice and fries with gravy. I got the chili pepper and curry flavours and they are simply to die for. They come nice and hot and are super juicy and tender. I'm a huge fan of the HK Style Milk Tea so I always get that as my choice of drink for the pitcher for $9.99. Although the customer service can often be a hit or miss, I simply love their wings. After I got the bill and had some left over chicken wings, I was pleasantly surprised that they charged me $0.25 for a takeout box. Overall, it's a pretty decent place to get wings and good HK style food. I would always come back here for the food despite the lack of customer service at this location sometimes."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollywood offers Hong Kong Style Cafe food at reasonable prices in a cozy place but its' food fails to deliver. First off I'd like to say I'm not the biggest fan of this kind of food. It's not the most enticing of options but I came here with a friend that frequents this place for late breakfast on the weekend.   First thing off the bat, this place looks super nice, it's warm, inviting and it's cozy. Awesome! Now if you come here for lunch, automatically nearly half the menu is inaccessible right off the bat. Well, that's unfortunate. Some pages offered items only in the afternoon, to dinner, then from 10pm onwards. So I just ended up getting the popular $6.99 breakfast special - beef satay with vermicelli option. I mean you can't go wrong with a bowl of noodles, eggs, and bread for $6.99 right? The noodles were average but I'm pretty sure it was doused with MSG. I couldn't finish it, the more I ate, the more it tasted like instant noodle soup base :( On the bright side, the the beef was really good and there was a good amount of it. For the eggs, I asked for them sunny side up, they were anything but. As for the buns, they were great! I totally expected toast so these were a pleasant surprise. They were warm, soft, and sweet. I probably could have ate a dozen.  Service was good and attentive and we had no issues whatsoever. Overall, cafe Hollywood isn't terrible but its' weird menu lack cohesiveness and the food lacks execution. Given the option, I probably wouldn't come back which is a shame because I really liked the ambience here."}
{"text":"Came here during a Saturday afternoon during a soccer game. Boy was it busy. We ordered the korean mixed rice with beef from the afternoon menu which was $7.50. It also came with a drink. We also got thr malaysian curry with ox tongue for $9.85 I believe. This was from their regular menu so no drinks were included. Portions for the korean rice was huge, I think there was at least two servings of rixe in there with abundance of beef and veggies. The curry was also good with shredded coconut and came with lots of ox tongue. The ox tongue was cooked a little bit too soft but it was still good. This place is known for their chicken wing basket which is only $9.99 if you order a jug of beer. Also there chicken wing with chips during their afternoon time is only $3.50. Comes with three full wings and drink. Service is fast, theres always someone walking around."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time yesterday and absolutely loved it! It was a bit of a wait because there was the playoff game however, they were very efficient with the seating- took about 20 mins. I'm sure on a regular day we would have been seated promptly.   We ordered the special on wings, fries and a pitcher (came out to about $31-which was a great deal for 2 people) I loved how crispy these wings are!!! Got the honey garlic bbq sauce and sriracha chili sauce on the side. I leaned more towards the bbq sauce as it was more runnier than the other. The special also comes with gravy which I swear tastes identical to KFCs'! Loved the food oh so much!   Definitely my fave spot for wings in the Markham area now and will certainly be going back in no time."}
{"text":"Hollywood Cafe replaced the Burger King that's been there for quite awhile. They've renovated to have a modern-esque theme with grammy statues at the front of the restaurant, as well as tiny ones aligned ion the middle of the restaurant. As a regular customer of the City Hollywood Cafe at Steeles (in Market Village), I was quite excited to come here. I immediately noticed that the place was well kept and that they had Preso Tea (a brand of bubble tea best known to Yogen Fruz) inside the restaurant as well.  Once I opened the menu, I noticed that certain food items were only served at certain times which really limited the options I had, which was one downside.  However I ordered a spaghetti bolognese which came with soup, bread, and drink for ~$6.50. It came with a Russian Borsche soup which was lacking in richness, and filled with hot sauce, so that was disappointing. The spaghetti bolognese was legit though; the sauce was meaty, flavourful, and cheesy. I was curious to try a panda milk preso tea which ended up being an extra $3.25 with the combo (original $4.99), and it had a lot of aromatic tea flavours too, and the tapioca was made right.  The service was fast overall and the meal was memorable; but I wish they'd have more options available instead of sectioning them off to different times, because honestly there's nothing else that interests me on the menu if I were to come back around the same time next time around. Keep in mind that they charge 25c for take-out boxes. You also get 10% off on your birthday for the whole party."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday for lunch expect a wait very busy crowd.  I like the booth seating and seems more spacious than other HK cafe quite comfortable.  Had the lunch special on the menu cus it comes  with bread (bonus) soup and drink.  Pork chop rice was good and grouper with spaghetti cream sauce was okay sauce was a little clumpy. Borscht soup was better than cream soup.  I guess their creamy stuff is not up to par.  Will come back to try other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Come here for a great deal on fried chicken wings and milk tea!  The service is good but the place is typically busy!"}
{"text":"I'm actually a pretty big fan of this place.   My brother and I came here on a Sunday around 2:00pm, and it was EXTREMELY busy. We waited for a solid 15 minutes before getting seated. We got the Beef Brisket with Malaysian curry and the Pork Cutlet, both of which are on the lunch menu for around $9.00 each.  The food was actually pretty decent, but extremely filling. We had to take two takeout boxes. We were served pretty quickly as well.  If you're looking for some quality asian food, I would recommend here, but expect to wait for at least 10 minutes before being seated."}
{"text":"Sister place of City Hollywood at Market Village, it seems that this owner decided to open up a second location due to the success of its original location.  Would I call it a success, well for starters it was merely impossible to get the attention of the waiter.  Our party came here on a weeknight just after 7pm the place was a little busy with staff on all corners of the restaurant. The interior decor of the place is nice, and its definitely an upgrade from the original location which looks like it needs some cleaning up to occur.  In terms of food options, Cafe HOllywood has a great selection of morning, lunch, and dinner specials that include soup and tea/ cold drink/ dessert, etc.  For the food option I decided to order their Stone-bowl (porcelain) korean dish with beef and veggies.  I must say the presentation of the dish was lovely......thankfully there was not too much rice, but more content...it was nonetheless an enjoyable eat! if you're into spice id ask for their thick chili sauce(almost smokey) and add it to this dish.. :)  The prices are reasonable, however what I didn't agree was they actually..... actually charge you $0.25 for a take out container... hmmm...... really?   For this place to even more clients, id suggest they get rid of that drive thru, because it makes the place look tacky from the outside and make it a patio area....more cha-ching!!!!!  I mean...we all knew it was BURGER KING back-in-the-days lol...Drive-thru anyone?"}
{"text":"I don't understand how people could eat here .... Do they not have taste buds or standards??? I would give this place -5 stars if possible. Food is extremely subpar to any other Cantonese/hk style establishment in the city and the quality is the probably one of the worst, if not THE worst in the city. They will serve you the fattiest and oldest meat possible. I, unfortunately, had to eat here once and that's already one too many times."}
{"text":"We ordered Portuguese chicken rice. There are 3 problems with this dish. 1. they did not fry the chicken, so the meat is not crispy. 2. there is no green pepper, no potato.  3. rice should be fried but they use steam rice.  The worst part is they charge me 0.25 for a take out foam box.   I suppose they don't customer to over order."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my basket of pepper chilli chicken wings! It was sitting on a bed of flavoured minced garlic French fries which were to die for, because typically I'm not a big fan of French fries. Since the food was so deep fried, it was great to have a jug of beer on the side to wash down the food. My friends also ordered 2 baskets of honey garlic wings which were drenched in red sauce that resembled strongly to BBQ. I heard the wings tasted nothing like honey nor garlic. I don't even know if it tastes like BBQ. It was a struggle watching my friend eating the 'honey garlic' wings across from me. All the food were devoured, except the 2 baskets of wings covered in mysterious red sauce."}
{"text":"Not bad! I had a serious craving for Chinese food and this definitely satisfied that. We had the pitcher of iced lemon tea which meant chicken wings were only $10!! They were fresh out of the fryer so they were very crispy (also hot, I burnt myself) but a little too oily for binge-eating that by the time I was done I hated myself a little. Mind you, we shared the wings basket amongst 3 people and we also had a noodle dish (I found this dish very enjoyable, more so than the chicken wings). Service was nothing outstanding. The restaurant was nice, clean, and air conditioned. Not something I'd eat often but if I have a craving I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've always driven past this place, not quite knowing what was inside (I always knew its former incarnation was a Burger King).  Finally stepped inside and was amazed at how it resembled more of a bar than your typical HK cafe.  We were seated promptly and were given menus to look over.  Everything here is decently priced and it seems like the portions are pretty good sizes as well (afternoon tea/2:30pm portions are smaller).  I got the spicy beef instant ramen and my mom got the Japanese teriyaki pork chop noodles (from the afternoon tea menu).  Both were decently sized and came with coffee/milk tea.  It's actually been a while since I've seen a restaurant separate the lemon slices from the tea so that was a nice plus.  Definitely going to come back here and will try their full menu next time."}
{"text":"I've been here thrice. All the times I've been here, it was packed and to wait to get a seat. It is a sports bar restaurant selling Hong Kong style and sports food. They have a few large screen TVs if you are into sports, and wanna hang out with friends over beer and Wings. They have wings special - about $10 for 20 wings with the purchase of a jug of drinks with ranges from $10 and above for pop and $17 and above for beer. Lunch is good here as well. Hong Kong style food combos at decent prices."}
{"text":"Two golden Oscar trophies greet you at the door. Red carpet experience in Scarborough! I am so full. The portions here are huge! I ordered their basket of wings and tomato sauce pork chop on rice. The wings are a pretty good deal - $16.99 for 20 wings with fries. The food was pretty good. It's a comfy dining area for a Chinese restaurant - it's modern and western. Specious booths for family and friends."}
{"text":"Finally I gave it a try since I didn't like the other Hollywood at market village. I walked in and immediately got a table. I open the menu and it was very disappointing because variety is so small and the restaurant is big. So I order a baked fish on rice with the soup and drink. The waitress went to the kitchen and came out with my food immediately ! The soup and drink came 5 sec ofter that! Wow I was actually worry the food was already made before I ordered. The taste was very average. Personally I won't come again!"}
{"text":"Afternoon tea is where it's at.  Three of us ordered a basket of 20 wings with fries and gravy for only $9.99, the draw is you have to order a pitcher of ANYTHING. Yes, any drinks they serve, come in pitchers! This means, pop, tea, milk tea, beer, Olvatine etc.. We ended up getting milk tea for $11.99, which later that night, proved to be a mistake as all three of us had trouble going to sleep haha, but that was our own fault.   We ordered the wings, HK style. My fave. Food was good, and service was quick. I would definitely come back here for afternoon tea. Maybe get another basket of wings, hahaha."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollywood is an offshoot of City Hollywood by Pacific Mall that serves cheap food at relatively cheap prices. Honestly, it is probably one of the worst HK-style cafes in Markham as the food is bland, lacking both flavour and inspiration.   Food 2/5 - I've been there a couple times, and have ordered things ranging from their steak to their stir fry beef rice noodles, and all are terrible. The steak I got was super well done and tasted like cardboard, even sauce didn't do anything to it. The stir fry was even worse as the beef in the stir fry was so salty I felt kidney stones forming inside me. Their only saving grace was the drink I ordered, the lemon iced-tea and that was good.  Service 3/5 - Average service. The waiters were pretty slow and even though the food is very simple it took a while to get to the table.  Price 2/5 - I mean you're paying $10 for bad food... it's still bad food. From the times I have been there I have never finished my meal there because it was bad in some way or another."}
{"text":"I've seen this place mentioned a few times on Instagram and Facebook so I've wanted to try it for a while. Unfortunately, it may be a long while before I return.  At first impression, the decor and lighting looked kinda nice. They have lots of big screen TVs that didn't necessarily fit in. The paper placemats didn't seem to match the decor. I though so anyway. The music was a bit loud so I indicated a table for two with my outstretched hand. A server motioned us towards a nearby booth and dropped some menus on the table.  Hmmm, my friend and I thought there were some odd items on the menu. There was Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Italian, and who knows what else. Dishes included Spaghetti Bolognese, Russian Bortsh Soup, Baked Chicken in Portuguese Style, Korean Beef in Stone Pot, Stewed Lamb Shank with Red Wine Sauce, Angus 3A Sirloin Steak, Cantonese Style Fried Noodle, Proscuitto and Leek with Spaghetti, Malaysian Larksa with Chicken Noodle in Soup, and lots more. I've been to food courts and food shows with less choices!  We had some questions about the menu so I waved a server over. She approached eagerly with a smile but I couldn't understand what she said. Maybe the music was too loud? No, that wasn't it. I have no idea what language she was speaking but it wasn't English. No English at all and no help from her colleagues. Since we couldn't ask her about the dishes that interested us, we ordered the Baked Chicken Portuguese Style and the Grilled Thick-cut Pork Chop by pointing to them on the menu.  Apparently, my meal came with a bowl of soup and a salad. I'm not sure if you could actually call it a salad because I finished it in two bites. Literally. The soup was a cream of potato with corn. It was just okay. Not very hot.  My friend's chicken dish arrived and it wasn't what we expected. Every Portuguese chicken dish I've seen has been grilled, piri-piri style. This was a coconut curry chicken served over a bed of rice after it had been baked (slightly burnt) in an oven. She said it tasted good.  My pork chop arrived, covered in a brown gravy that I wasn't expecting. It was served with a generous helping of white rice and steamed vegetables. It was a little on the dry side, despite the gravy and I could have done without the gravy. The pork chop could have been seasoned a little more.  Overall, it was a very confusing experience. We were puzzled by the menu, left guessing by our server, mesmerized by the TV that had a two second delay from the one next to it, playing the same program, and then there was the loud Billboard 100 Pop music. Oh, I almost forgot the screaming kid in the booth next to us.  On the bright side, dinner for two was a measley $23.90."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollywood is the modern, stylish and polished younger sibling of City Hollywood from across the street. The menu offers the HK style east-west fusion staples like baked rice casseroles, all-day breakfast and deep fried french toast. The options are separated by time (lunch, happy-hour, dinner) so remember to check which page applies to you.  Also, expect a 20+ minute wait for a table during peak hours. Fortunately, the tables turn over quickly and the service moves fast to keep up with the incoming patrons.   I had the garoupa casserole with cream sauce meal ($7.50 11am-3pm) which comes with with a soup, a bun and coffee/tea. The soup options are the typical cream vs borscht soup. The borscht leans heavily on the sour side of the palate, but balances well with the soft buttery bun that comes with it. The main dish of white rice (with scrambled egg chunks) and a large piece of deep fried fish is liberally doused with a thick white sauce. There was a minor attempt at browning the top with a dusting of cheese. The cream sauce was bland, but can be substantially helped with the aid of the pepper shaker. A filling lunch meal that can easily produce leftovers for the next day. The tea brings the meal to a close and is the true litmus test of all HK style cafes. Strong, a beautiful dark caramel color, and without the dreaded dry aftertaste. Green light approval!   Personally, I prefer the nostalgic look and feel of City Hollywood, but Cafe Hollywood is more acceptable to the modern aesthetics of most people."}
{"text":"The food isn't amazing but whenever my family and I visit this restaurant there are two dishes we get: their Basket A (a deal that gives you 20 chicken wings, fries and gravy) and their seafood casserole. The seafood casserole is my personal favourite. You can choose to have it with rice or spaghetti, but what's special is the sauce they use. It's a white sauce that isn't alfredo but something similar. Really yummy and filling. The casserole comes with shrimp, mussels, and some other fish that I can't identify. I usually share it with the rest of my family as it's too filling for just one person. The restaurant overall is a good family location, or for any kind of group, with shareable dishes. Not too loud, and not too crowded. Their decor relates to their name as there are mini movie posters framed and posted all around the place. There are a lot of tvs too playing the news and some other programs. A good restaurant."}
{"text":"I'd say 3.5 stars after having been here several times.  The food portion, like a lot of other people have said, is pretty big and you can definitely have leftovers. I think it can be a hit or miss depending on what you order. The minced beef dishes (like the baked spaghetti and the minced beef with egg) are better I think. They also use thick toast for their french toast, which I love, but the egginess is mostly on the inside (the batter doesn't seep through the whole slice of bread).  The service can be spotty. When you go in, no on greets you - it's only when someone notices you that you get taken to a table or told which order you are in line (so can get chaotic during busy times). Some servers are really nice, and some are your typical mean Hong Kong servers who yell at you. The first time I ordered the Portuguese chicken with rice, there was hardly anything on top. Someone else ordered the same thing with a much better presentation and more chicken/sauce, so I asked an older lady if she give me more sauce, especially when I could compare it with someone else's. She yelled at me and said it's all the same - it was so obviously not. So then I asked someone younger and she was much nicer. She gave me a new plate of my order that was much better, with more sauce and chicken and better presentation.  Also, like others have mentioned, if you want to change anything on their existing menu, prepare to be disappointed - they make a lot of things in advance, so they will either say no, charge you extra, or take away something (e.g. drink)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch since i haven't been here after they relocated from market village. Food is pretty good for what you pay for. We ordered a spaghetti and a breakfast combo. Taste is pretty decent. Price is a very good deal. Would def come back here for some quick bites!"}
{"text":"If you've lived in Markham long enough, you'll know that this place used to be a Burger King. Oh those memories...  Right, so I came here on a Friday evening around 9:30pm. It was about half full as the other half was just leaving. The menu is similar to most Chinese style cafes. I was really excited about them serving breakfast all day though, that's definitely good to know. My friends and I opted for two baked Portuguese chicken with rice.   The rice dishes were served within about five minutes, which made me a bit curious, the plates were barely boiling hot and the sauce didn't even looked baked. I let it slide, at least the food was hot. I mixed it all up and had a bite, it didn't taste like anything, the sauce was bland, the chicken was weird, like cardboard. I ate it anyway because I was hungry.  My other friend sat for a while before deciding on an ice cream sundae, except it took the staff forever to notice we wanted to place another order. It also took over a half hour for the ice cream sundae to arrive as we had to ask a staff to check on the order.  They have happy hour menus and serves drinks of the alcoholic kind. They've also dressed their cafe up like a lounge, with some television screens on the walls. Almost like a Chinese version of a Boston Pizza or something.  There are definitely other options out there for the same type of food marked with similar price tag. I'd like to go there next time."}
{"text":"I loved their garlic bread and lo Sun tong! Solo yummy! Then another time I had their laksa not bad.. lots of bits of scallops!"}
{"text":"We came to Cafe Hollywood to try out their chicken wings specifically, because one of our friends suggested that it's some of the best wings around. We had reserved a table for 10 for Saturday lunch at 1pm, and it was definitely worth planning ahead, because they place was jam-packed with many people waiting at the door when we arrived.  Environment: Not to confuse with its other location nearby at Pacific Mall, this Cafe Hollywood is located near Warden/Denison and is not accessible through only taking TTC. For those who drive, there are ample of parking at the plaza.  I have been to the other location at Pacific Mall as well, and personally, I think I prefer this location better because the space is brighter with more natural light, and it didn't feel as cramped.  Keeping aligned with the restaurant name, the restaurant was decorated in Hollywood themed pieced, but it wasn't as decked out as the Planet Hollywood restaurants.    Food: The reason we reserved our table at 1pm was because they have a Wings Special, which as opposed to paying $16.99 for 20 wings, you can get the wings for $10 if you order a pitcher of any drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic). We ordered 5 baskets of wings to share, which included flavours such as the Original HK Style, the Chili Pepper, and the Honey Garlic. The wings came with fries on the side and also some gravy for dipping. When the wings arrived they were fresh from the fryer and they were absolutely addicting. The wings were fried to perfection as skin was super crispy and the meat was really soft and juicy. In terms of flavour, the only difference between Original HK Style and the Chili Pepper was that Chili Pepper had some black pepper and garlic sprinkles drizzled on the top, while the Original HK Style had no additional seasoning. The Chili Pepper definitely tasted better and it wasn't very spicy at all.  However, that's where the table turned. The Honey Garlic was absolutely HORRENDOUS. The friend who suggested the order started saying the wings were \"alright\", but gradually his words became \"this is torture\" and later on lead to \"I can't take this anymore\". Yeah...that basically says how terrible the Honey Garlic wings were. The fault was mainly in the sauces that they use, such that it basically tasted like a crappy supermarket western BBQ sauce, and despite its name, it contained neither honey nor garlic.  The fries and gravy were awesome as well. The fries were freshly cooked and were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The gravy was to die for that I didn't even bother to use ketchup on my fries.  To get the wings special, we ordered pitchers of beer, soy milk, and milk tea, which ranged between $12-15. The drinks weren't very good as the milk tea was way too sweet and the beer felt diluted.   Service: Even though we booked our table for 1pm and we arrived a little bit later than our stated time, we actually didn't get to sit down until 1:20pm. It was very awkward starting at the front entrance, because we were already in a pretty big group and there were also many other customers waiting for a table, so the entrance was completely blocked.  It was a little bit on the slow side in terms of service. Since they were quite busy during the Saturday lunch hour, it was very difficult to get the server's attention. Though the food came out after around 10-15mins of wait, which was acceptable.  Overall, I would come again for their wings because there were very good and the wings special was a good deal. The reason I gave it a 3/5 was mainly because of the nightmarish Honey Garlic flavour and also the slow service."}
{"text":"Amazing price for afternoon tea special - where else are you going to find a meal with a drink for less than $5? Although it is quite cheap, you definitely get what you pay for - the sides is a few pieces of chips (not even fries!), two pieces of lettuce and a slice of tomato and cucumber. But if you don't care about the sides then this is the place for you! I come here for the wings and I find it to be one of the best deals out there and you can also order a basket for quite cheap! I have tried some of the other items on the menu and find it a bit mediocre. Guess it is hard to screw up deep fried wings!"}
{"text":"This is basically HK cafe meets Jack Astor's. Think relatively hip, modern decor with TV screens littered here and there to be rather reminiscent of North American bar-and-grill style restaurants, with a menu that is very traditionally HK-style cafe.  I am used to a larger menu with more options from HK-style restaurants and it was a bit lacking in variety here. It is worth mentioning though that their options cover the whole gamut, from a few traditional HK-style cafe dishes, some traditional Cantonese dishes, and then the random Korean or Malaysian option here and there.   At our table we had the lamb shank, steak with spaghetti, and (foolishly) a Korean rice. First off, the Korean dish - just don't bother with it. Moving on, the steak was called an \"angus\" - who on earth knows if it really is or not - but it didn't feel or look much like a typical angus steak. Asked for it to be cooked medium rare but it came out medium well, so meh. The lamb shank was decent, but was cooked in a characteristic HK style manner that left the shank without much character. Not exactly \"flaking off the bone,\" but I guess that might just be due to the way they stewed it. One of my dining companions had the HK milk tea and thought it was pretty decent.  Maybe the wings are a better news story. I did try the fries and found them quite good. Other than that, there isn't anything special about this place, and I think you can find better HK-style food in Markham/Richmond Hill (albeit with less cool decor). Service here was standard HK-style service, nothing to be applauded or complained about. Came in on a Saturday evening and while the restaurant was busy, there were no lineups. In terms of value for dollar, it's pretty good, bearing in mind the lackluster food quality."}
{"text":"I can't help it. Cafe Hollywood has that comforting nostalgia that I can't get away from despite hit or miss experiences.  The original location has closed so this is the only one left. Portions are definitely smaller (I want to say around 2/3 of the portion they used to give) but the taste is the same. You have to know what to get - dishes heavy on the meat are usually on the dry side. The wings are great though not your standard super sauced up Western-style wings. Prices have gone up slightly for some things but I don't mind - they were shockingly cheap to begin with and it's still okay value. They've also introduced fancy new menus where meals are $11 upwards which symbolizes a shift in traditional HK style meals vs. the clientele they cater more to now and perhaps a bigger focus on the \"sports bar\" theme.  They've installed eye-blindingly bright potlights in the pathway up to the restaurant and there's a small patio with string lights now (not sure if it's open)."}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas day. There was no one else open other than McDonald's, Tim Hortins or Chinese restaurants. I figure this would be a good time to try Cafe Hollywood. Every Chinese restaurant we drove by the parking lot would be packed and there was no difference here at Cafe Hollywood. It was around 12:30 and there was a long line up. We had to wait about 40 minutes in order to be seated but it was expected. Once we put in our orders we were served pretty quickly.  Complementary bread and soup was given when ordering from the lunch menu. We got the spaghetti bolognese, portuguese chicken with rice, grouper with rice and the 20 piece wings and fries. The lunch meals came with coffee or HK style milk tea. Everything tasted okay, no real complaints but nothing that stood out either. HK style cafes are really about quick service, decent food for a good price and they definately delivered on these aspects. They also have bubble tea here which was not too bad either.   The place is pretty new so everything seemed newly renovated and clean.   Since is was Christmas day they even hired an Asian Santa Claus. That was really unexpected but funny seeing a thin Asian man with a fake pot belly dressed as Santa. I'm pretty sure they didn't have to waste the money in hiring him and there still would have been the same amount of customers."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollywood is a great location for a meal with family or friends. They have an extensive menu (Hong Kong cuisine). I highly recommend the $8.99 Happy Meal and their chicken wings. The meals come in large portions, typically with soup and tea as well. Their Hong Kong style milk tea is authentic; not #1 in the city, but still very yummy. Their location also has a lot of parking spaces, but the restaurant is always busy so you might need to wait for a bit."}
{"text":"My first review for 2015! Anyways to the review... City Hollywood..... They've been OG's for 10 years approximately and only now they expanded and made a new location! They must of really pressured Burger King to take there spot and that drive thru of there's.   Make use of the drive thru!!!! I would totally use that to get my HK style milk tea. ' one medium milk tea please' ya that sounds about right....   Ok.. To the review... Place is really modern looking compared to the one at pmall. A lot of modern interior decorating and about 6 tvs. Good for watching sports, and HD chinese dramas...   Ordered wings that was there happy hour special. I had come here for lunch so too early to drink a jug of beer... But they don't even have beer!!! Since they are too new, they don't even have their liquor license yet! Thats what the waitress told me.  The wings were alright. Pretty saucy for my personal liking. Waited way too long for wings tho... Waited close to 30 mins to just get wings....   Overall not worth the wait for wings on a Sunday afternoon lunch time. Lesson learned just go with lunch special instead or else be stuck waiting for your food. No different from the pmall location. I would just go back there instead. The line ups can get pretty crazy and packed inside...   Would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Ah hollywood! This place is a somewhat new, more of the second restaurant to the first one by pacific mall. The decor is quite nice. It's filled with lots of movie pictures framed up, has lots of Tvs to watch games or news, and the lighting is quite nice.  The food is exactly the same as the first restaurant by pmall. It's still just as good and oh man definitely filling. I love ordering the all day breakfast because it comes with 2 eggs and ham and hot or cold hk tea! I also love ordering the wings because they are nice and piping hot! Watch out for them wings cause they be dripppin dat oil! Serious though careful when you first get them.   the place can be quite packed sometimes... During lunch due to a lunch special and at night around dinner time because this place is cheap and large portions! Also taste very very very good! Definitely a good place to try out!"}
{"text":"2.5/5  This place was a bit of a letdown, considering it's affiliation with City Hollywood Cafe (a place I went to when I was little and enjoyed, but haven't been to since).  I don't know of many HK style cafes that have a drive-thru section with it...but I haven't seen anyone use it in my two times I've been here. They seem to have kept it from what used to be Burger King.  Both times I visited here the restaurant was relatively busy. It seems to cater more to the younger crowd, although I do see seniors dine here occasionally. Unfortunately service is already poor from the get-go, as the servers seem to not pay attention to customers coming in...so be prepared to wait a bit for service. Oh, and if they don't give you the menu once you're seated, be prepared to flag someone down again. Chances are the person seating you won't be seen after.  The menu isn't exactly diverse aside from the drinks, partially thanks to a partnership with Presotea. Note that the Chef Special options do not come with a soup or drink, and most of the other options don't come with soup (but do come with a drink). Although late night options look more pleasing, though I haven't tried late night yet.  For afternoon tea I ordered the Korean beef noodle in soup. It was okay aside from the fact the beef slices were too thick, meaning it was quite tough to eat. When I tried this place for dinner, I ordered the baked seafood spaghetti with cream sauce, which came with a soup. The cream soup was watered down, and so was the cream sauce on the spaghetti. The spaghetti itself and seafood were about your standard HK style cafe quality, with overall generous portions as well.  I suggest if you order drinks here, stick with the Presotea options. It costs a bit more, but it's better value than their standard iced lemon tea/milk tea options.  My parents actually seemed to be more lukewarm about this restaurant than me. If I was the one making decisions, I wouldn't come back here.  Free wifi! Ask for password."}
{"text":"Much better than the location at Market village, where I found a dying grasshopper next to me on the window still."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. I've been eating at Hollywood for over 1/2 a decade and was skeptical to try this new location. It's been open for quite a while but tbh, food isn't anything special and the prices are more expensive then their original location. Basically upgraded the price and image but with bleh food. The service was also kinda okay. Only a few tables were seated and yet service was slow as a snail, though one of the male servers was quite nice. If I'm going back, it'll probably be because of the preso bubble tea bar. Gotta rate that too.  Ordered:  Chicken curry with rice: the curry was very watery and the taste was quite mediocre but the portion was alright. The rice itself wasn't too impressive either. But have to admit, the chicken was quite tender.   Bibimbap (they called it Korean rice something...): let's just say nothing about it was Korean except the look of it. The veggies and the stone pot... the beef was over cooked and marinated with soy sauce (clearly not Korean). They could've at least used Korean rice but nah. It was regular rice. Again. Nothing Korean about it. Portion was larger then my face so I'd give them that much. Overall, i would've gone easier on this item if they didn't claim it to be Korean... it's a shame."}
{"text":"My new fave wings joint! I've been wanting to try their chicken wings for a while now since they're advertised as the best in town. And they stay true to those words!  There's a variety of flavours to choose from: HK style, honey garlic, curry, hot sriracha, and black pepper. The HK style is fried chicken with gravy on the side and the honey garlic is not like the typical or expected flavour, instead we were told it was similar to sweet and sour sauce.  We ended up getting a basket of 20 pieces of chicken in the HK style which came with fries. Their chicken wings are pretty amazing - moist and juicy wings and drumsticks but super crispy on the outside! The basket costs $16.99 but if you order a jug of cold drinks, the total cost would be the jug ($11.99-$12.99) + discounted price of $9.99 for the basket of chicken.   Would I come back? YEEES. If you're craving for wings, you should hit up this place!"}
{"text":"Came here for afternoon tea, got the baked Portuguese chicken and it was the worst baked rice dish I ha e ever had, the chicken tasted like it was boiled and just covered with sauce to hide the bland flavour, never ever coming back to this crappy place again"}
{"text":"Good lunch combo deals here but in terms of the taste and quality of the food I would say it is just mediocre at its best. Tried the Spaghetti bolognese lunch special which comes with bortsch soup + bun and coffee/tea. You get a lot of pasta for a pretty decent price (only $6.99 for all 3 items) but the beef that they used tasted a little off and the bortsch soup tasted concentrated + salty with an overpowering amount of MSG. For the spaghetti I would say it was 95% pasta with a teaspoon of beef but for the price I guess we can't really complain.  They do have a decent # of tv screens so I suppose it might be a better place to stop by to grab some drinks or light snacks and watch a game or the playoffs. The food was really not that great (2/5) but because it is good value for the lunch specials I would be leaning more towards 2.5/5 overall"}
{"text":"Good price, good portions, good food! :)  I love this 'new'-ish location.. though it can get busy during lunch/afternoon tea times...theres a good reason for that.  I ordered the spaghetti Bolognese for lunch ($6.50 - includes soup&bread, hot drink).. I only managed to finish half of my spaghetti!).  The service is relatively fast... bonus is that they serve Presotea here! My only complaint is the seating towards the middle of the of the restaurant - I noticed that they added a row of \"small\" tables to maximize profit...I witnessed a customer get their table knocked and food spilled as the space was so tight.. I don't think that's even in compliance with fire safety routes..  P.S. takeout containers cost $0.25 each."}
{"text":"I am quite upset with this place. I had come here Thursday evening for dinner. First of all, upon coming in through the door, we were ignored. There was only 2 of us and there were 3 servers who passed us. Second, we had waited about 10 minutes for someone to even acknowlege we were there. Third, getting a server to come take an order took another 10 minutes. Food was good. Fries came warm enough, not hot. It was crispy. So I had lost my glasses there that night. Called for it Friday. Spoke to someone and they had said it was there. Come Saturday night...tonight, and they cannot find it. Told me to look in the lost and found box. Its one thing to say its there, and its one thing to say its not there. The servers are not quite friendly. But food was good."}
{"text":"Decent place to hang out if you don't care about the quality of food and drinks. Apparently they serve 'Taiwanese' bbt but it tasted like over brewed (to a point that it was bitter) that was extremely sweet. Or maybe I just expected it to be more like Chatime.  Other than the drink, I tried to order the thick-cut pork chop but apparently it was sold out so I settled with the regular cut. I was glad they ran out because even the regular cut pork chop was tasteless and not to mention the watery gravy.   However I'll give a + for their Service. Most of the server was attentive.     Overall, service alone won't warrant me to go back again."}
{"text":"Average food with okay pricing. The place looks a lot nicer than the other location beside Pacific mall. They also have bubble tea at this location which is really nice. Nice place to go to for sports as it still kept the sports bar idea at this location too"}
{"text":"The most delicious food I've ever eaten. Definitely should be Michelin star restaurant!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Cafe Hollywood since we have been to their other location and liked it. They did a good job renovating the old Burger King into this new decor (the two giant Oscar statues at the entrance are a bit too much). We got there and it was busy but we still managed to get a table. I find the menu a bit limiting since every page seems to have a time restriction. I ordered the baked garoupa on rice and my wife ordered the curry beef with rice, both from the chef special menu. We both found the food okay but nothing extraordinary. We had the french toast for desert and that was good. It took us a while to get a staff to come for the bill. Overall was not that impressed so I will probably stick to the original location."}
{"text":"Food was alright, ain't too expensive and the portions are quite filling especially for cases such as afternoon tea. Restaurant is a nice romantic casual spot and I like how Presto Bubble tea is right inside the restaurant. Overall 8/10."}
{"text":"This is the place to come in Markham for fried wings.  I have gone to the other wings places like st. loius but Cafe Hollywood has the best wings that I know so far in Markham.   Their clientele is chinese.  The other menu items are pretty cheap and usually end up costing around $10-$15.   But their signature item is really the wings.   You get a basket of 20 wings and there are four flavors.  I always get the chili pepper wings.   you can choose honey garlic, curry, HK style, Sriracha, and honey garlic BBQ.  I have never tried these flavours and I stick to my chili pepper wings.  The wings also comes with fried potatoes at the bottom of the basket.   The wings are amazingly crispy.  Not oily and delicious.   I can eat the whole basket by myself.  Service is alright.  typical Chinese restaurant service if you know what I mean.  I would come again for sure just for the wings."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite HK cafes in the area. They are one of the only ones that still give you *those* buns with your meal. You know the soft fluffy slightly microwaved ones that are cha chaan teng specific. It also has pretty authentic HK cafe \"borscht\" very reminiscent to the ones in HK with a good tang to it. My go to meal is the baked spaghetti bolognese. It's a good sized portion that is actually baked and has a nice dusting of cheese on top. Another solid option is the Portuguese chicken which has a good sauce but the chicken can be a little more/less dry depending on whether you get white meat or dark meat. The lunch meals comes with a drink (milk tea) and any upgrades have a charge.  The cafe itself is loungey and has a lot of banquette seating. There are a lot of TV screens too that are constantly playing CP24 which is good if you're normally an HK breakfast pro but you forgot to bring a newspaper with you. For the folks that prefer their news digital, there is free wifi and the password is noted on the placemat."}
{"text":"100th review!!  I have some special memories with this place :')  LOVE this place for two reasons, the fried chicken + 1 jug of drink special, and the big tvs and small crowd during the NBA season.   The special is well worth the money, feeds 2 super hungry adults, or 3 hungry adults. It comes with a jug of cold beverage and it seems like we can never finish it (unless its beer)!  If you come during the first quarter of a raptors game, theres a good chance that the restaurant isn't filled up. Love their big screens as well.  Don't expect superb service. And I've never tried other things on the menu yet. But it's a nice and clean asian cafe with parking right outside."}
{"text":"Location/Service:  I've been wanting to try out this place for awhile now since it is always advertised on the radio. I have never been to the original location before (City Hollywood inside Market Village) so I really had nothing this location to. Apparently, this location has been here for awhile now and it is bigger than the original location. My family of 4 came here the day after boxing day for lunch at 1pm and when we got there, there were 3 other larger groups (4-5ppl) waiting ahead of us. It seemed very busy as there was no one at the front desk to help us with the wait. We had to flag down a waitress in order to put our names on the waiting list. It didn't really bother us because after all, it was lunch time and a 15-20 min wait was expected. The interior of the place is quite big for a HK cafe. The tables and seats looked comfortable and the place overall was nicely decorated for Christmas. We were seated after a 20 minute wait.   It wasn't hard for us to flag down a waitress to take our orders. She was quick and accurate and she knew what she was doing. I liked that she just gave us things like extra plates and ketchup based on our orders without us asking her. Bonus points right there. And when we did ask for more utensils and condiments, she and other waitresses didn't look too bothered by it.   Food: We ordered 4 things to share amongst ourselves: - Minced beef with egg on rice ($7.50): This was the worst dish of the 4. The sauce tasted really weird. It is definitely not the traditional HK style dish that we're used to in HK or in other HK cafes. Minced beef you say? to be honest, I don't even know if there was any minced beef or meat in there. It was too tiny that I felt like eating just rice with some kind of sauce. We will definitely NOT order this ever again.  - Portuguese style baked chicken on rice ($8.50): This dish was okay. I liked how they \"stir-fried' it with VERY LITTLE bit of egg in it. The Portuguese sauce was okay, coconut-y. I like that the chicken was boneless as many other HK cafes have it boned-in which always makes me hesitant to order it.   - Garoupa casserole in cream sauce ($8.50): This was the best dish out of the 3 entrees. The cream sauce was tasty, the fish was 'shallow fried' and it was very good. The entire dish was very delicious! For just an extra dollar, I would order this again.   All lunch specials and non-special entrees come with a daily soup and a sweet buttery roll (either Chinese style Russian borscht or corn cream) and coffee/tea. The HK milk tea was okay, nothing special. The yingyang (mixed coffee and tea) was not good; it seemed that they used instant coffee instead of brewed coffee. I noticed that there also have Preso BBT, so I might try that next time.   - The basket of chicken wings ($19.99 for ~20 pieces) is what the restaurant is known for apparently. We ordered it with Honey Garlic and BBQ sauce. I should have ordered the HK sauce instead. It came with a little bit of fries. It was good and crispy. I might come back again to just have wings and a pitcher of beer with my friends in the future.   Overall, the food was mediocre. The quality isn't the best, but you get what you paid for. For ~$10, tax included, a daily soup, meal and coffee/tea is good enough to keep you full for awhile. Portions are large so you will probably need a takeout box (which you have to pay $0.25 PER BOX, even if you can't finish it when you dine-in. This I find ridiculous people are just SAVE people and not waste it and you charge us a quarter for a styrofoam box?)  There are definitely better HK cafes out there. I did find that they have the least MSG in all of the cafes I have been to."}
{"text":"Okay, I get it that the other location is so impossible to park, it make sense to have a second location...but can walk here from the other location in about 10-15 minutes? Don't really get it. Their service staff is, I find, much much better than the other location, and the decor and environment much much better, but it doesn't have the menu to go with it. Their menu size can only be matched by pubs, but they don't serve alcohol here, but teaopia, which has a more impressive menu. Their food is definitely not impressive, either. Okay, I'll give them that their dinner rolls are nicely done, but not much match its quality. Everyone's order comes with their set soups: Russian or Cream. The Russian was, simply, overpowering, and the cream tasted like mixing lots of water with flour....It has ABSOLUTELY no taste of any kind. \"BLAND\" is too descriptive for it. Mine was the only one that came with a \"salad\", which was, maybe, two bites worth. Their dressing is nothing to write home about. The main course, the other couple and my wife all ordered the \"Twin Steak\" set. The husband ordered chop and chicken, my wife and her friends both short rib with chicken. They were done alright, but the sauce used for my wife's was watery and just doesn't taste right with short rib...which also has no taste of its own. I had the grouper cutlet, which was nicely fried, but consider basa is usually used instead of grouper, my wife doesn't like it. It wasn't half bad, but I was very disappointed that they didn't have tartar sauce not mayo that comes with the fish. This place is quite busy, but we just don't get it. What attracts people here?"}
{"text":"Ordered spaghetti bolognese and I only got half of what I was supposed to get. Either the plate was way too big or they just ran out of spaghetti, I deadass finished my food in 2 min on my grandmas son"}
{"text":"Hey Cafe Hollywood: why do you feel the need to wheel around a cart full of dirty dishes and garbage through the dining area every time you clear up a table? Why doesn't someone clear the table and bring the dirty dishes to the back like every other restaurant I've been to? Do you think that I want the stench of garbage and the sight of bones and stained napkins when I eat? All of your waiters and waitresses are doing double duty of serving food and bussing tables. I see them with their plastic gloves handling garbage and then handling my food. It's pretty disgusting. To top it off, you forgot one of the meals for one of the people in our party.  We were already finished our lunch by the time you brought his meal. I sincerely hope Dinesafe comes knocking on your door soon."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service, and affordable prices. I don't know what's not to like about this place. It does get packed during afternoon tea hours. Otherwise, their food is always good. I tend to order their baked Rices and fried food. You can't go wrong. I went during their peak hour at around 2pm on a Sunday and ordered a baked rice. For $7.50 I got a baked rice with a drink."}
{"text":"Sunday Morning was so busy especially during Thanksgiving weekend. Everywhere was full of people and it was hard to get a parking spot. When I drove along Kennedy Road. I saw some empty parking in a plaza. Indeed, it was Hollywood Cafe...a place I went almost everyday when I was in High School. Hollywood Cafe was in Market Village a couple months ago. Times definitely changed. I still remember before their steak was like $12.99. NOW it is selling for $18.99.  This place's decor is very decent. They even have a golden statue like the Oscar statue outside.  I usually like to order their Chicken Wings Basket with a Beer Draft. But as a breakfast I ordered their steak.  Their food quality as usual was just soso. nothing special.  $18.99 for a steak meal and it does not even come with a drink or soup.  I asked their staff whether it was OK to add a soup if i pay extra.  She refused to do it.  This place is quite HK style and most of the customers are HongKongese."}
{"text":"Was a busy Friday night as expected. Surprisingly since Burger King used to be here. The waiters are usually busy and sometimes will ignore you. The menu is the same but less options as the market village counterpart. The atmosphere is more ambient with music and TVs. Wait time for a table usually 10 to 20 mins but I suggest to arrive early so you can get a spot. Parking recommend near the Cibc side as it is limited on their restaurant. Great for dates and gatherings."}
{"text":"First time at this location as I've always gone to the one at steeles. I mostly just order the chicken wing special $16.99 for 20 wings and fries. Hong kong style wings are the best! There are other specials after 1pm as well.  Their beef fried rice noodle is delicious! $7-8 And their chicken Portuguese rice is creamy and tasty. $7-8 Would definitely have both again.   Service is a bit slow as the venue is bigger now but nonetheless same service of food.   They charged us 50¢ for 2 takeout boxes which was lame.   The place does take credit cards.  Went back again for breakfast. They have all day brekky Asian style -- soup based with eggs/ham on the side. $5.99 brother got the satay beef noodle and said it was tasty and pretty good. Comes with some bread but eat it quick while its warm cuz it'll become rock hard after (microwaved obvi)  I ordered the twins -- no idea why its called that. Basically pork cutlet with BBQ pork, rice, sunny side up egg, veggies, cream corn soup and coffee/tea $7.99 you can get other options too. Pork was dry but at least it wasn't oily? Definitely slather the ketchup on. Corn cream soup was delicious!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food here. Everything was hot and flavorful. Prices were great, we got the wing special which comes with 20 wings, fries and gravy for $10 when you buy a pitcher of any of their drinks. We also tried the spaghetti bolognese which was better than typical Hong Kong cafes. Service was alright, we had a hard time flagging down wait staff at some points but that's kind of the regular. The restaurant itself was very modern and clean and comfortable. We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN WINGS!  *Drrooool  The wings are made fresh: deep fried, hot and super crispy! The skin is literally the best part. I'd highly recommend ordering the HK Style or Pepper Chili flavour.  I'm a fatass so I pretty much eat this every weekend...at least every other week.  The hot HK Style milk tea is not bad either. But I would not recommend getting a pitcher of milktea with the wings (only comes cold and it tastes watered down)."}
{"text":"Literally only come here for the wings and beer. You get a pitcher for $19.99 and 20 wings for $9.99 more. Would recommend the HK style wings.   Parking out front. Great HK cafe style resto. Lots of different selections if ur not feelings wings. I enjoyed it but nothing crazy out of the norm. Quality better and fast service."}
{"text":"Price is pretty cheap. This is one of the worst hk style cafe i tried in Toronto. Order portuguese chicken rice, the chicken has no taste at all, just felt like they have blanched chicken cover under these yellow saucw that has no flavor as well. This place is really busy, not sure if i didnt order the right food. Service is same as regular hk style cafe. Will not come back."}
{"text":"I like coming to this place for the wings. They have a pretty good deal that comes with fries ($16.99)and you can also get a jug of a beverage.   The wings are deep fried, so the dry kind, but they still taste amazing. There aren't as many flavours to choose, perhaps about 5? The fries come with gravy so it's the perfect combination. I came here a few times to watch the bball game, it's decent because it has a few screens to watch from.   Overall, the food is generally pretty cheap and comes in large portions. This place is a huge upgrade from their older location."}
{"text":"The service really sucks. I been here a couple times to know that if you do not speak Chinese, you can be waiting a long time to be served. When I do come here with my friends, they are super fast but when I come here with my boyfriend it is like they are tolerating us by serving us. Their food is alright, we only come here for the peppered chicken wings and the fries and gravy because they are actually amazing but may not be worth it when the younger staff gives us horrible service."}
{"text":"Big portions, food comes fast, efficient service!  Love the section where there's magazines for you to pick up and read.  Don't miss out on trying their HK style chicken wings. It's deliciously tasty."}
{"text":"Customer service needs improvement.. BADLY. Employees & manager = dumb. One bad visit can make a regular customer never want to come back."}
{"text":"all i ordered was the royal early grey milk tea. so i don't know why it took 20+ minutes to come out. and when i finally got it, it wasn't all too impressive either. the grass jelly and pudding was a bit thicker/harder than i preferred and i honestly could not taste the difference between the two when i drank it. tapioca was also not soft and squishy all the way through. the earl grey milk tea itself was pretty good. might try again. i enjoyed taking raunchy pictures with the statues outside."}
{"text":"I went to this location lastnight with my family, got seat right away, everything is set in the table, saw tons of staff working.  Order the special with one jar of cold  lemon honey drink with the $9.99 chicken wings with honey garlic sauce.  The sauce taste like more BBQ more than honey garlic, and the gravy is too liquid, doesn't taste like gravy at all.  The drinks are not that bad.  Very crowded lastnight, a few lineups"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and overall it was pretty good! Ordered the noodle with fried pork in black pepper sauce and washed it down with their passionfruit drink.  The food came pretty quick to the table. The fried pork was nice and crispy and very well seasoned.  Eating the fried pork along with  the noodles drenched in the sauce balanced everything out very well.  Will definitely  come back to this place to try out their other selections.    The only negative thing if can say was that my guy friend had to use their washroom to drop a deuce (not because the food was bad  or anything). After several minutes, I got a message from him on my phone stating that he had no toilet paper.  I chuckled a bit and asked an employee for some TP and held  my breath to go in to give it to him.  Can you imagine if that was you and you didn't have a friend at the time?"}
{"text":"It's a decent place. Good but not exactly great. I had the Lamb Shank with rice and vegetables. The flavours were good and the gravy made the rice flavourful. However, the cuts of lamb were really tough to cut and did not contain much meat. It took a long time to cut through and thick pieces of bone certainly make you work for your meal. I don't think I'd order this dish again. I'm really interested in trying their wings, as I keep hearing they're amazing and worth the value so I'll be back to try it sometime. The large television screens around the restaurant ensure you get to watch the sports you want to watch."}
{"text":"Piss poor service. Front of house was non existent. No one to greet and seat you. People just come in and walk by to grab servers attention.   Once seated. The serve staff are too busy chatting and ignoring you. Why does it take 15 minutes to place an order?  Servers place items at wrong table then 5 min later will bring to you. Excuse me but I expected my order to be fresh, no fresh off someone else's table.  Management and wait staff are incompetent.  Don't waste your time here and move onto other cafes further north or just south of Steeles."}
{"text":"The food here is honestly disgusting. There hasn't been a single time I didn't throw up after dining at Cafe Hollywood. The chicken is barely cooked which probably contributes to my horrible post dining experience. I've been to cafe Hollywood 4 times and each and every time, I end up vomiting away my $15.99 and the previous night's dinner.   Service: 5/10 Efficiency: 4/10 Quality: 3/10 Environment: 5.78/10 Overall: pretty bad"}
{"text":"There used to be a Hollywood Cafe in Mississauga, but it looked nothing like this! Outside the restaurant stood a huge Oscar statue (great photo op) and the Hollywood theme continued throughout this Asian fast food-style cafe. We went there for brunch and everyone waited in their cars until the door opened at 11:00. The menu consisted of the regular HK-style breakfasts (omelettes, stay beef with macaroni, etc.) and lunch combos (pork chop with rice, curry beef, beef fried noodles). The prices are very cheap and the food quality was ok. For me to make the drive from Mississauga to Markham, I probably wouldn't pick this restaurant - but if I'm in the area already, I would give Cafe Hollywood another shot. Their saving grace for me is their decor, cleanliness and spacious seating (my baby makes a mess sitting in the highchair AND they have a change table in the bathroom cuz not many Chinese establishments do)."}
{"text":"This review of Cafe Hollywood is based on my afternoon tea experience.   As it is a Hong Kong Style Cafe, I don't really expect much service. But I was left standing at the front for almost 5 minute till I waved someone down so I can be seatd. Maybe I should just seat myself?! No menu, no tea, no nothing till a wait staff walked by and I almost need to tackle him down so I can get a menu. After I ordered, there was still no tea or utensils.... I felt like such a nuisance going after for some basic needs and this really annoyed me...  But if the food worth all these hassle and lack of service?!  Sadly the food was not even up to par with standard HK style cafe.  My Korean Beef Noodle in Soup ($6.50) was served with a cheap instant noodle which was not even been cooked through. The \"fresh\" beef was a big slice of chewiness. I expect them to at least use better quality of noodle and meat. I really don't know what \"Korean\" with this item?!  I paid $2 surcharge for Presotea's Earl Grey Tea but was served with Hokkaido Milk Tea and at this point, I just felt too tired to complain.  It was a weekday afternoon and the restaurant was quite busy. Time to hire more staff to prepare for the Holidays rush!"}
{"text":"Cool and modern place to relax and grab some food. But don't reply on the quality of the food."}
{"text":"The menu may sound decent, along with the prices, but the food is not worth mentioning at all. Dishes taste like they're reheated in the microwave, bland, and quite frankly, don't feel pleasant at all to eat.  Wait staff is awful; you're either ignored or not tended to for long stretches, takes multiple times to get a simple drink, be it water or something else.   Would give a zero if possible."}
{"text":"Cafe Hollywood is affiliated with City Hollywood at Market Village.  We ordered a Cantonese Stir Fry Noodle ($9) and a Stone Bowl Rice Korean Style ($9).  The stir fry noodle was very saucy and with little variety of ingredients such as meat.  The stone bowl rice was in fact a Chinese interpretation of bibimbap, instead of a real Korean bibimbap, because it used Jasmine rice instead of Calrose rice.  There was no oil at the bottom of the stone bowl to create a rice crust.  It felt like a lazy version of bibimbap.  It tasted alright after I had dumped Korean hot sauce on it.  I mistook Cafe Hollywood as a sport pub, but the waitress told me that it was not, though they were in process of getting a liquor license.  There is a sign outside that says \"sport bar\".  Am I confused or not?  Services is fast.  The interior decoration is really nice.  I can't find a glimpse of its past life known as Burger King in it.  Food only, 2.5 stars.  Overall value: 3 stars."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst service ever. I ordered an earl grey milk tea and it took 40 mins to come. Had to ask 3 times for it to finally come. Not sure why either as the dude at the bar didn't look that busy. When I got the drink it was bland and watered down. I walked to the bar to ask for more sugar in the drink and received such hostility. The dude at the bar argued that this is how a regular tastes like and I shoulda specified I wanted it extra sweet. I just said \"ok can I just get more sugar in this please.\"  He grabbed the drink from my hand and slammed it in the trash and said \"fine I'll make u a new one\". Gave me so much attitude when I just wanted a bit more sugar? Oh and when I got the 'new' drink it tasted exactly the same as the old one :)  Food was also bad. Cantonese chow mein was sooooo salty. Their chicken dish tasted like it just got defrosted. Also not a fan of their laksa (TOO coconut-y and not spicy enough)"}
{"text":"I miss late night BK here! Prices are pretty good for what you get. $9 gets you 2 choices of meats, rice/noodles, soup and a drink (Before 7). The interior is quite nice and seems pretty kid friendly. Larges TV's which makes it a unexpected decent sports bar. I also tried the tomato chicken&ham twin dish combo, that wasn't good. Pretty bland. Stick with the Meat Combo/Short Ribs. Overall pretty happy with this place."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Massive mess ups. Got in, ordered wings and took 40 mins to come. Guess they had to kill the chicken, pluck it before frying it.  Added a second order after 25 mins and I ask where the food is and waitress forgets to put it in.  This place is a joke with the worst service where the wait staff just talk amongst each other."}
{"text":"I've been to Cafe Hollywood on multiple occasions.   The environment is cozy and clean. There are television monitors plastered at every corner of the restaurant so if there is a big event going on, chances are, it will be on the TV which gives it a bar-like atmosphere. It's not too loud either so you can have conversation and not have to scream for your party to hear you.  Food wise, it is a Hong Kong style restaurant. They dont have too many options to choose from and most of the dishes were mediocre. For the price though (around 9$ a dish), it is reasonably priced with large portions. It is also a good place to go if you have the late night munchies.   Overall, Not a bad restaurant. I go every so often when I want to indulge in some cheaper restaurant options."}
{"text":"This location is a lot better than the one at Pmall. It's more spacious and a lot cleaner. The decor looked great too.  I came here with a friend a few months back. I ordered the spaghetti bolognese and received complementary soup and bread. I don't enjoy soup in general, so I passed on that, but the bread was good. The spaghetti was very tasty and came in a huge portion. The only flaw is that because of its size, you can get bored of eating it very fast. I wasn't able to finish the food, and I don't believe I ended up taking the leftovers either.   I would return here versus the location at Pmall just because I find it superior in quality and service. Prices are about the same, and so is the menu, so I'll be back to try new items eventually."}
{"text":"Ohhhh Hollywood. How I love/hate you. Your amazing \"happy meal\" combo for $8.99 is so delicious. Everyone should order it. It comes with 2 meats, spaghetti or rice, veggies, a soup, and a bun. FOR $8.99. Unfortunately it ends at 7pm, and that's where I am frustrated at the lack of options there are.  Hollywood definitely has some hit or misses. While I love the spaghetti they serve, I dislike their breakfast and found it cheap and bleh. That's why I don't bother coming after 7 anymore. The timings for different items on the menu is also kind of annoying. Why can't I order this 24/7??? My boyfriend is also annoyed at the lack of options for him as well and usually orders only the wings, which are quite delicious. That being said, the cheap price of these items are one of the big factors of coming here. A lot of the dishes are under $10. I also enjoy the presotea that is offered at a lower price if your combo has a drink with it.  Service is very... Asian lol. The younger workers are definitely more receptive, but the older ones do not care. They will take your order, give you your food, and never come back unless you call them over.   Hollywood is a 3.5+ for me. It's one of the establishments I keep coming back to for cheap eats with comfy seating and lots of tv's. They have their off/on days but generally it is on for me! :)"}
{"text":"We had to wait for half an hour to get our reserved table.  This was during lunch time on a Saturday with long line ups. Once we sat down, the waitress gave us a decent amount of  time to look over the menu before getting our orders.  My friends and I ordered two sets of chicken wings on special - chilli pepper and honey garlic.  We also ordered a jug of iced milk tea as part of the combo. The chilli peppered wings were absolutely delicious.  The honey garlic wings not so much.  There was no garlic taste nor were the wings sweet with honey.  We all thought that the wings tasted like a bad version of bbq sauce instead.  It really was a bit puzzling.  The iced milk tea tasted refreshing, albeit very sweet. All in all, it was an ok experience."}
{"text":"Decor of the restaurant is pretty good. 3 TV on each side of the restaurant.  The statue of award is outside. Had ox tongue it is OK. We also order some chicken wing with different sauce.  One with chili garlic sauce and other bbq sauce. Taste good had steak fries and peas carrots and corn.  The foods came pretty fast.  All good. I'm definitely going to come back again when I come to canada."}
{"text":"Cheap for the amount and quality of food, with spotty service = your typical HK meal. Love it. The all day breakfast meal comes with so much and the wings with gravy is amazing. Love the cream soup as well. Will be back ... like every weekend. It's definitely cheaper with better value than a McDonald's breakfast."}
{"text":"The HK style wings here are truly the star of the show. For only $9.99 with a purchase of a pitcher it's a great way to grab something delicious and greasy while watching the game.   More of a sports bar then a cafe, Hollywood boosts a large modern interior filled with film and sports memorabilia. The place definitely has a nice low key vibe and they have a large selection of cheap eats to choose from.   The meals are what you pay for. It'll fill you up but don't expect top quality dishes. If you're going to get anything, wings are the way to go! Side note, for such a clean and modern establishment I was a bit disturbed by how dirty the bathrooms were."}
{"text":"We went there with some friends and this place gives you your bang for your buck. We ordered the \"happy meal\" which was a choice of 2 meats ( I chose the ribs and steak) with choice of rice or spaghetti. You can choose your sauce so I chose the black pepper sauce and it also came with a drink ( ordered a \"lai cha\"). All of this meal cost $9.99 which is incredibly affordable and cheap. The ribs and steak were tasty, I liked the sauce. I wouldn't say that the quality of food is amazing, but for a HK cafe, that's how it usually is. The HK cafe was good, very typical of the cuisine. They gave us a pretty big table since I had a toddler and stroller so space and service wasn't bad. They were quick to let us change the table when we needed the space and accommodation."}
