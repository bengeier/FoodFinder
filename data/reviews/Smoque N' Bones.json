{"text":"My favorite BBQ spot in Toronto. The food is great and their Old Fashion is excellent."}
{"text":"When I went here a few days ago I didn't expect to go into a small restaurant that only had 3 tables for there guests and the rest has to sit in the bar. Not only that there is only one server to cater to all the customers that were dining in. We waited for about 30 mins to get our table hence I made a reservation for 8:30 and didn't get seated till 9 since she was too \"busy\" serving other customers. 

Not only that when we got seated we waited almost an hour for our food to come and we still haven't gotten served. We sat at the bar since there was no other tables available. We watched how they prepared the food and to be honest, I was sitting there for a good hour and I saw none of them wash there hands while serving the food. Not only that they had a plate of ribs sitting on the table not knowing which table it goes too and of course they give it to us while it's been just sitting there for a good 10 mins. We obviously refused to take the ribs and we touched it to see if it was warm and we told them to take it back. However, they took the ribs back and it's been already touched and they instead put it in the take out container and gave it to the person that ordered take out. That's disgusting!!!!

This place has the worse service and it's not worth the wait what so ever..."}
{"text":"My roommate and I decided to go here to celebrate his birthday after an episode of 'You Gotta Eat Here!' made us crave pulled pork. It was busy and bumpin', even for a Thursday night, but our server Shawn (the real MVP) was still friendly and enthusiastic. 

I got the pulled pork sandwich and a side of sweet potato waffle fries with chipotle mayo. Believe the hype around those fries that I am now contributing to - hands down the best waffle fries I've ever had. The sandwich was also great, a little on the smaller side in terms of portions, but still quite filling and very tender. 

Clearly, these guys know what they're doing when it comes to pulled pork! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great bbq. Taylor is the best bartender /waitress ever. Would go here every week if we lived nearby! Shoe string french fries were perfect and corn bread was to die for. Would give 10 stars if possible!"}
{"text":"The only reason I won't give a 5 is because of the wait staff. Server was not attentive at all. Reservations were made and we still ended up at the bar. The chef was more attentive than they were. 

Being from the south, this BBQ was on point!!! I highly recommend going here and I will be back. The chef on duty rocks!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ! This was our first time trying this restaurant out. We were lucky enough to be there during the owner's shift. We sat at the bar, in front of the grills (best sport in the restaurants in my opinion). We instantly welcomed and offered several free samples of ribs, sausages etc. It was a great experience and the food was super delicious. One of the best BBQs in the city so far"}
{"text":"I love the food and service. I tried the sweet potatoes fries and pulled pork today and it's awesome.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Ribs were tough.

Big no-no. They don't need to fall off the bone, but come on guys, ribs at the hot counter of your grocery store have better texture. These ribs were not cooked \"low and slow\". They were cooked fast and hot, which leaves the meat tough.

Flavour was decent, ambiance is good, unfortunately they took a shortcut and skipped the first rule of true BBQ."}
{"text":"First visit had the sampler plus a sausage  with  sides of beans and coleslaw. All the meat was great...the next time I will skip the beans they were  nothing special and you do not  need to order the coleslaw   because it comes on  the side of most of the meat dishes..This was lots of of food probaby enough for 3, i will be back."}
{"text":"Food is amaaaaazing here! Love literally everything on the menu, and also the atmosphere and the staff are great! MUST VISIT"}
{"text":"Went for dinner on a Saturday, wasn't too busy (5:30pm) Service was great, very friendly. The prices were really great, I got the pulled chicken sandwich with coleslalw and it was very tasty! 
My friend got the brisket with mac and cheese and corn bread and she really enjoyed it!

The only miss was that we ordered a drink and we never received it, which is okay since we didn't get charged! :)"}
{"text":"This place has some incompetent people running it. We booked a reservation for a large party two weeks in advance only to show up and have them say they can't accommodate us. Waiters are all great guys tho. It's a disaster!"}
{"text":"Didn't have ribs at 6pm on a Sunday, but said they would be ready in two hours. Does anyone come to a BBQ place for anything besides ribs? Thought the two hour wait was a joke, but no. The ribs really would be ready in two hours. They told us they'd be happy to get us drunk while we waited. Our friends wanted to stay, so we stuck around. Anything afterwards was my problem, I guess, because I should have just bailed when they didn't have ribs. We had pulled pork instead.

Asked for cornbread, but they were sold out.  Overpriced mixed cocktails, but beers were all right. Apparently the mixed cocktails tasted good. I didn't try one.

When bill came, there was an extra order of brisket on there which we had them remove. We didn't order any brisket. When we gave them money (they only take cash), they said they were out of change and could we wait a couple of minutes. A BBQ place that doesn't have ribs at dinner time, and a cash place that doesn't have change. Awesome.

All this said, the people seemed nice and the food tasted ok, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Food was amazing - loved every dish we had. 5/5 for the BBQ. 

We had ribs, brisket, pulled pork with mac and cheese, onion rings and sweet potato waffle fries. Everything was delicious and the sauce was great. 

The only thing holding it back from the 5 stars was the service. The server was friendly and very helpful but a tiny bit inconsistent (a few things forgotten). Not a huge deal by any stretch but once they nail that this place will be a 5.

Be sure to check it out."}
{"text":"Let me start with the fact that the food was really good. We had beef ribs, brisket, and several delicious sides. Very tasty with delicious bbq sauces on the side. Beer menu is pretty solid.

One of my biggest pet peeves when going to a restaurant is being turned away from having a table because they're all \"reserved\". We showed up at 5:30 pm on a Friday night and every single table was empty. The waiter forced us to sit at the bar and not one of those seats was filled until we were ready to leave almost 45 minutes later. I get that you have those tables booked but use your brain and make an exception or two when every single one of those tables is vacant. 

Cleanliness is also a bit of an issue. The man taking the riblets out of the smoker was not using gloves and was also touching his phone/the meat at the same time. It was somewhat offputting since we were seated in direct view of the smoker. Pretty gross to be honest.

Cocktails are OK. Nothing special. My wife had a whiskey sour and the presentation/delivery was only average. If you're going to add egg whites to a cocktail they should be at the top of the drink where it belongs. 

Anyways, food is really good but there is definitely room for improvement."}
{"text":"I had a great time eating here.   The food was really satisfying and as I'm writing this, I'm craving more.   I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, shoestring fries and lemonade.  The pulled pork sandwich was amazing.  I had been debating getting just the meat but I think the sandwich was a good choice.  There was a good portion of meat and the coleslaw in the sandwich went really nicely with it.  The fries have a slight spice to them and are served with a smoky tasting mayo.  They were pretty addictive and my companion was happy to dig into them too as there was more than I could eat.  He had ordered the mac and cheese as a side which was good but I think we both preferred the fries.  

I'm hoping to come back soon and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Although the meats were a little dry to my liking, the Cobb salad was phenomenal!!! All their sides were amazing and overall experience very positive."}
{"text":"Great food but was cheated. I watched him mix my drink with a less expensive bourbon than what was listed on the menu. Before the bill came, I asked him if they ran out of the bourbon that was supposed to be used & was told that it was indeed in stock. However, the bill was not adjusted accordingly. Makes me wonder how many times the same stunt has been pulled on others. To my mind, it's tantamount to stealing from your customers. I won't be going back, either alone or with friends."}
{"text":"A little while back, I stopped by Smoque N' Bones for dinner. At the time it was the new kid on Toronto's Queen West block, and was owner Alex Rad's initiating establishment. Prior to picking up the kitchen knife, Rad was a corporate finance professional. But make no mistake, this is no amateur spot. Smoque N' Bones set out to be an authentic Southern smokehouse, and it definitely delivers it well.

First up was the 14-hour roasted pulled pork, which ended up rather dry. Disappointing, but this is one I'm willing to return for its redemption given all the praise I've heard from others. The Beef Brisket on the other hand, did not receive a complaint from me. Tender, juicy, and generously layered with fat. You can order either of these in 1/4, 1/2 and 1-pound servings.

While the first two carnivorous orders were good, the show stopper here would probably be the Pork Side Ribs. Carved bar-side, the ribs are piled onto a paper-lined silver tray, with a glazing brush, and extra barbeque sauce. While everyone at my table generously doused their ribs, I had mine sans-sauce, and loved them! Moist, tender, and oh-so smokey. If you're one to like to your ribs fall-off-the-bone and meaty, then these will meet your fancy. 

Accompanying our smoked meats were a selection of southern-inspired sides. Each arguably better than the next, these miniature portions are perfect for sharing and gives you great variety. My favourite was definitely the buttermilk onion rings - delicate, piping hot, and crunchy. On top of the ones we had that night, there are some comfort-like sides like cornbread, baked beans, candied yams, and shoe string potatoes. 

Make sure you go early if you have a large party as there is less than 3 dozen spots in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for my bday in Sep 2015 and we were given one of the large tables upstairs.  Ordered few apps for people to munch on.  Drink, food and service were outstanding.  Liked it so much that we returned last month for my wife's bday.  They remembered us and took care of our guests that much more. We tried their ribs and pulled chicken sandwich and they were outstanding

Writing a review now cuz I just forgot.  Came across the place just now and thought they should get recognition they deserve"}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place this past Saturday as my co-worker had just been on Friday and I can say we had a really dismal experience, to say the least. We were hoping to be there for only two hours so we gave our food order first before our drink order, a platter for two, pretty easy, right? Somehow 45 minutes into our wait, our server informs us they had lost our order. It was pretty frustrating; beyond that the drinks came out slowly and the service felt quite neglectful once our food did arrive. The beef and pulled pork were pretty good, but the chicken tasted over cooked and dry, compared to my experience at Barque earlier that week. While the server did take our drinks off the order at the end of the meal, still between the food and slow service, I would spend my time and money elsewhere. If you need to satisfy your BBQ fix, I definitely recommend Carbon Bar or Barque."}
{"text":"we ordered take out via foodora and encountered a scam: the portions were tiny, way smaller than presented in the restaurant itself, yet super pricy. The ribs were not really smoked but boiled and grilled which will get you executed in Texas, but somehow pass in Toronto. All together it was beyond shameful, so small and poor we had to get some pizza after. BE WARE!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy restaurant with a nice atmosphere for casual drinks meals of meat meat meat and meat! 
During this visit we ordered a beet dish, mashed potatoes, baby back ribs, pork side ribs, spicy sausages, peppercorn roasted beer, shoestring fries, chicken poppers, and finally their brussels sprouts dish, which was highly recommended by our waitress.  We also ordered their Old Fashioned with a stick of bacon.
The ribs were charred deliciously on the outside and still tender on the inside.  Each came with BBQ sauce and a brush to add more flavour. The spicy sausage was just the right amount of heat.  The roasted beef was tender and flavourful.  The Brussels sprouts were good as well.  My favourite dishes of the night would have to be a tie between the baby back ribs and roasted beef."}
{"text":"I went here last week with my boyfriend and it was such a great experience! The food was just perfection, you can tell the chefs take pride in their food. The drinks are so delicious, i seriously have no complaints. I recommend the ribs- obviously, and DO NOT sleep on the corn. I could've ate a plate of corn the whole night. My server (a young man- his name escapes me), was very nice and quick and although some may think the portion sizes are too small, I thought it was just right and in the end, its good enough to order a second round. Total  comfort food ! Will be back on the weekend :) Take all my money,  lol!!!!"}
{"text":"Up visiting from the Los Angeles and must say the best barbecue place I have seen or tried in Canada. The owner is knowledgeable and cranking out amazing bbq in a cozy space that makes you feel welcomed and like family. Must say try the pulled pork Mac and cheese it's amazing especially with the spicy bbq sauce and a side of bourbon.  They also have a bourbon lounge up stairs with over 240 different bourbons on hand so if you love bourbon me bbq and you live in Canada you have found heaven on earth!!!"}
{"text":"Best Barbecue I've ever had no exaggeration ...!!!!  Great Service Owner Himself made our food humble and very down to ever guy ... Not to mention you must try the mac n cheese and the Ribs are just perfect!! Not a chicken person and almost ate a Whole-one here !!! Must come and try if you in Toronto !!!"}
{"text":"Most amazing ribs Iv had in a really long time. Will definitely go back. Staff was also very friendly helpful attentive and just great all together."}
{"text":"Been here twice... First time was delish!! So id thought id bring my very picky parents here. My dad wanted to have some bbq and i automatically thought of this place. My mother never gives great reviews or compliments... But she couldnt help herself. She loved the place, the owner, and the food. 

They loved the ribs! My favourite is the sauage. The drinks are super well done as well... Alex has to be one of the best owners/managers around. He indulged my parents and all their questions...

Such a great place and you feel special no matter if youve been there a ton of times or only twice."}
{"text":"This place I found off of yelp !!! I visited here while I was in Toronto... There prices were Very high !!! I felt for a Dive ... The waiter was the best thing about the place !! He made me feel welcomed... He's from Australia... Kinda like and crocodile Dundee in Canada... But the food was just ok !! Chicken was Dry and Burnt ... Pulled pork was moderately good !! The Ribs were fine nothing overwhelming great !! Just another Barbecue spot off of queen st !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork sandwich! The buttermilk onion rings were very tasty as well. One of the better BBQ spots in Toronto without a doubt."}
{"text":"In my original post I had given smoke n bones 1 star,due to poor service at the time. My 1st review is below. They were kind enough to contact me to invite me back but me and my fiancé felt too awkward. Since then, me and my fiancé have tried many of the best rated Bbq places in Toronto. In the end smoke and bones was the TASTIEST! I want to apologize to the owner for the horrible review and let him know to keep up the good work. Your food is good. We haven't been back since but I know we can't ignore the best bbq joint in town forever. We will be back and hopefully no service issues. I'll update this post on our next visit, hopefully I'll end up giving them 5 stars instead of 4 stars.


I took my family here to try something different. When we arrived the restaurant was relatively empty. The staff were not very friendly moving us from table to table. We had a six people at our table and it was loud and hard to hear, unpleasant for a family dinner. We ordered our food and waited... 40 minutes went by and all we had was our water. We asked our waiter and he said he would check on it. After 20 minutes and no word from our waiter, I approached the waiter again and told him it been an hour and we have no food. He said its he would check on it again. He talked to another waitress but never went to check. At this point our lovely family dinner has become a stressful nightmare, with angry hungry family members. I decided to take things into my own hands so I approached the owner explaining its been over a hour and my family is ready to leave. He told me we were NOT waiting an hour and it's coming right now! I went upstairs told my family and we waited another 10 minutes. 1 hour 20 minutes and no food and poor service made us walk away. Second time in my life walking out of a restaurant due to poor service."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night and the waiter (he was the owner's close friend and seemed more like the store manager) seated us shortly at the bar upstairs facing the wall of whiskey, SCORE!
My husband recently got into whiskey so sitting at the bar faced with the hundreds of bottles of whiskey on display was unique and a major plus for us.

We ordered the Pork Side Ribs, 2 piece Fried Chicken, with sides of Mac N Cheese and Brussel Sprouts, with a Bread Pudding for dessert.

The Pork side ribs were very flavorful and the house made bbq sauce was delicious. The ribs themselves were a tiny bit dry, but still very good.
The first piece of the fried chicken was very good, crunchy and delicious, but was also very oily and heavy so the second piece didn't taste nearly as satisfying (not surprised really, but it was a bit heavier than some other fried chicken that I've had in the past).
Both sides were soo good, who'd have thought Brussel Sprouts with caramelized onions would taste so good?! The brussel sprouts were perfectly charred with the slight sweetness of the onions and the sauce perfectly complimenting the slightly bitter taste of the brussel sprouts.
The Bread pudding was a perfect finale to an already awesome meal. If the meal itself sucked I would go back just for the Bread Pudding, it was THAT good.

The restaurant itself was also very lively and welcoming and the friend / manager was a very spirited host. That's the feeling you get from Smoque N Bones - that you're being hosted by people who are genuinely happy that you're there rather than being served by waiters and waitresses."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving three stars is a great friendly service. 
Portions were tiny, food was nothing special and compared to many other BBQ places this was disappointing."}
{"text":"I went during lunch on a wednesday, and it was quiet, so we got our food super fast. The brisket sandwich was insanely delicious. I wish it had a side included in the price that they have listed, it's a BIG sandwich already and I can't justify paying extra for sides I'll probably only be able to eat half of. My co-workers loved the ribs and pulled pork as well. They've kept the windows open to the street so people outside seem to just be drawn in by their noses. Your hair will smell of bbq smoke for the rest of the day though, so beware ;)"}
{"text":"The chicken and lemonade was amazing. Service was really good but I wish they noticed us earlier to be seated. 
Ribs were pretty good but would have been better if it was cooked longer, it could have been much more tender. And I didn't not like the brisket at all but the bbq sauce is amazing. 
As a short girl the chairs were bit too high for my comfort but it's not a biggie. 

Great location as well just across from trinity bellwoods park. 

3.5/ 5 

I will be back."}
{"text":"Smoque n Bones---What can we say......a nice and quaint neighborhood bar that stands out from most bbq joints in the downtown core. But is it exceptional? Is it a must? Not exceptional but a must try! The highlight of our evening was the bartender on the second floor, yes, it is a two storey bar and the second floor is the place to sit. Going back to the bartender, the drinks were creative, the presentation was top notch, just the right amount of booze in every drink. To top it all, his suspenders were bomb!!!! Now the food--Brussel sprouts are mandatory, beef tips should be tried but not necessarily repeated. Brisket was good but not fantastic (too much bun). My husband and I did not try the ribs this time around but something to look forward to on another snowy day. This is a 3.5 star rating but because there is no half stars I am bumpjng it to 4. My fellow yelpers...keep eating and keep reviewing. Until the next one. Eat on!"}
{"text":"Amazing place if you want that authentic BBQ flavour. Pulled pork sandwich with waffle fries was phenomenal. We sat at the bar which in my opinion was better because we got to see the chefs at work. Bartender was very nice and attentive, noticed every time my drink was empty and offered me a new one. Who could say no to their delicious Caesars!!"}
{"text":"I came here with my friend yesterday. After searching for a bit on where to eat we saw that this place has pretty good ratings and decided to try it. 

We got there around 630ish...the two tables by the entrance were reserved so we were seated at the bar. The music was on quite loud but it suited the atmosphere of the place. 

The waitress came and we ordered our drink...the lemonade and then the sampler for two. 

The drink I didn't like it. All I could taste was the bourbon and no lemony taste lol. 

We ordered the half rack, pulled pork and peppercorn beef. But they gave us beef brisket instead of the pulled pork. 

I'll have to say the ribs and brisket was really good. The beef brisket was really tender. However the peppercorn beef wasn't that good 

Within ten minutes the restaurant filled up pretty quickly. I guess we picked a busy night since the upstairs of the place was reserved out too

I would've liked it if there was a bit more room. I found that I kept kneeing the guy beside me because of my huge purse lol"}
{"text":"I love that they offer a quarter rack of ribs--just the perfect amount of food when ordered with a side.  The price is kind of ridiculous, though; you'd be better off ordering a half-rack and taking the rest to go (or splitting the cost with a friend who also isn't super hungry, which is what I did).  Where this place really shines are the sides, though.  The brussels sprouts were sweet, smoky, salty perfection and the mac and cheese was nicely creamy and rich.  Despite how busy the place was, no one tried to hurry us up (both good and bad--we had to chase down our server to get our check in the end).  I'll definitely go back, though next time I may opt for takeout to eat at the park--we saw lots of people doing so while we were there!"}
{"text":"To be consistent with my rating scale (found at the bottom of all my reviews) I've dropped Smoque N Bones to 3 stars. 
It's still a great place to eat but service can be spotty at times.

Stopped by here for a pre-dinner snack while waiting for our friend to meet up with us. We had a pulled pork sandwich, 1/4 of sausage and Mac and cheese between the 3 of us. The pulled pork sandwich was perfection. The bbq sauce was not too sweet and not too vinegary. The coleslaw was great and left me wanting more. The sausage had a great snap to its casing and the meat was great. I probably wouldn't order the Mac and cheese again, didn't have enough of a cheese or possibly not the right cheese for my liking. All around one of the better bbq spots I've been to in Toronto. Will hopefully visit again for a full meal.

5 Stars: I crave eating here. The best of the best! It's the type of place I'd bring out-of-towners to. I talk about this place to anyone I meet. This is always an option when I'm looking to go out for dinner.

4 Stars: I love eating here. I will tell friends and family about this place and may even bring them to eat here. Possibly needs a particular taste or an open mind.

3 Stars: I don't mind eating here. This may be a more generic place but still an enjoyable meal. I may have had a small bad experience here. I usually won't go here unless invited or for any event of some kind.

2 Stars: I probably will never eat here again. I won't go out of my way to tell people not to eat here but if they ask me I will share my thoughts. One glaring fault will bring it down to this rating.

1 Star: I will actively tell people not to eat here. It's very hard to get a 1 star because some places can just have an off night due to a multitude of reasons. Multiple glaring faults have to occur to drop this low."}
{"text":"Came here with my wife last week and got a seat at the bar right where all the ribs get cut up before serving. It's a nice casual atmosphere that is perfect for a bbq joint. 

We were feeling super hungry, so we got the baby back ribs (full rack), 1/2 pound of beef brisket, coleslaw, and the sweet potato waffle fries. This all came out to about $80 after tax and tip. So it is a bit on the pricier side, but we did order a lot of meat and I definitely think too much for two people.

The brisket was really nice and tender. I love that they put the bbq sauce and a brush on the side since my wife and I disagree on how much sauce we like. The ribs were a bit burnt as it was unattended to a little longer than should have been on the grill. It wasn't bad, but it definitely left a bit of a dent in my enjoyment of the meal. The slaw was nothing to write home about and in retrospect, I should have went with something else like the brussel sprouts, which looked pretty good. However, we thought getting something lighter would help cut all that meat and fries were were about to eat. The main event was definitely the sweet potato waffle fries. It is a must try here and I really recommend it to anyone that is unsure of what to get. My wife and I really enjoyed it, and I don't really love sweet potato fries in general. I find that they usually are too soft, but they know what they are doing with these waffle fries here."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this little brisket place, if the looks alone don't draw you in the smell of frying brisket and bbq sauce will always win you over!!! 

Bit of a wait to get my first of two sandwiches but my lord worth every second!!!"}
{"text":"Have been to countless \"Southern\" bbq places back home in the states. Leave it to a bunch of Canadian boys to do it right. Peppercorn Beef was to die for. And the potato salad has meat in it. Potato salad HAS MEAT IN IT. So jealous that Torontonians have this gem in their midst."}
{"text":"4/5! If you love BBQ- you must try this place. I recommend getting the sampler for 2 so you can try a variety of dishes! The ribs are incredible. As for sides, I highly recommend the spicy corn and Brussel sprouts. The beef brisket and coleslaw were average. The only downside are the seats- I personally am not a fan of high chairs without backing. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Amazing BQQ, I recommend the platter for 2. 

Owner was an awesome guy came around, and introduced himself."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout, $50 later, we ended up ordering Chinese because...
The $15 pulled pork mac and cheese comes in a small container large enough to satisfy a small child.
Their regular mac in cheese is 1/4 of the size for $7 (two spoons for $7). Really? 
The two piece corn is really one piece cut in half 
We ordered 1 pecan pie, and 1 bread pudding.  Instead we got TWO pecan pies, and it wasn't dry and gross.  Since my boyfriend hates pecans, we ended up throwing out the other  because they didn't pack the right item.
Overall, that was super disappointing - waste of $50.  We'll never go back
- Smallest portion sizes 
- overpriced
-poor quality"}
{"text":"We oedered the ribs and the pulled pork sandwich. The food was delicious and the service was fast. However, the ambiance was not pleasant. The music is loud, the table  layout is tight and the chef is always arguing with his employees in front of customers. Since the place is really small, the kitchen is in front of you, which gives ur clothes a bbq smell."}
{"text":"Ordered the brisket and waffle fries for a solo late weekend lunch. With a drink, the total came to $36 incl tax and tip. The food was good, but I felt the portions were bit too dainty for a BBQ joint and for the price."}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ in the 6, maybe the country. I haven't traveled enough in the States to say definitively the best in North America, so here we are.
 Accept no substitute."}
{"text":"Great food undermined by poor service.  When we first enter the restaurant, we were told the wait time was 15 mins.  Ended up being an hour.  I wouldn't mind the wait but felt misled.

Peppercorn beef 5/5.
Smoke chicken 4/5.
Baby dry ribs 2/5.  The ribs look nice but it's very dry - like rubber.  It's tasty but not tender.  The frozen ribs I got from the supermarket is better.  Really disappointed with the ribs as our server said it's the best item on the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic meal. Returned for the second time, and it was better than the first. 

First time my husband ordered a pull pork sandwich and shoe string fries. I got 1/4 lbs of the pull pork (no sauce) with side coleslaw and side kale greens. Would had given them 2.5 stars then. (food was tasty, service was slow, staff didn't tell me that pull pork already comes with coleslaw)

Decided to give them another try. 1/2 rack ribs, 1/2 lbs beef brisket ($16.80), pull pork mac & cheese ($8), side onion rings ($6), side coleslaw ($3.9), and corn bread ($3.9). 
Ribs were spectacular, perfect balance between juicy and meaty. Pull pork mac & cheese goes really well together, their mac & cheese has a really fresh texture (not stodgy), just enough flavor. Each of the side dishes are fantastic on their own (onion rings were super fresh, you can taste the individual ingredient in their coleslaw). Though we wish we could order just one corn bread, it was pretty heavy ($3.9 for two small loaves).

One complaint is staff kept the window table open as it was reserved for the chef's family. Though several customers requested it. Not sure it was necessary to note that it's reserved for the chef's family... as long as you say it's reserved. Also, the customer ate and left before the family even showed up."}
{"text":"This restaurant is very nice, good atmosphere, friendly staff & excellent barmaid Ally, she went over and beyond to make my birthday weekend special.  The food was phenomenal, the ribs were nice & tender, sauce was excellent. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed it was not very sanitary.  I was looking forward to some bbq but after arriving and seeing that the food prep area was open to everyone(no glass dividers) I was turned off.  We sat at the counter where a guy was cutting up chicken with no gloves and wiped his hands on a dirty apron and also a dirty towel.  I watched as he continued to touch various surfaces and food without washing his hands."}
{"text":"Awesome ribs, this is the best Uber Eats experience we've had so far.

Perhaps it's the style of food that holds very well, and tasted great after reheat.

Love their sauces, ribs are tender and juicy.

Will try their chicken wings next time"}
{"text":"I've been eating here a few times a month since it opened last summer. The meat is perfectly executed, the sides are plentiful and well-priced, and owner Alex knows what good customer service means. I have had everything on the menu at this point, and everything is delicious (including the Cobb Salad, which isn't my go-to at a BBQ joint!) I recommend sharing the sampler, so you get to try a few different things, and ALWAYS get the ribs. And the chips. And the corn. And the coleslaw. And the pulled pork...."}
{"text":"Portions were on the smaller end...but probably because I wanted more. Much more. I became a shameful, gluttonous child when I ate here. I do not know how but, even the brussel sprouts tasted delicious in a meaty way... WHAT DID YOU DO TO THE BRUSSEL SPROUTS?! I felt like a carnivorous dino tearing into all the meat! Maybe not a t-rex because my arms are proportionate to my body.

Must admit tho...the brisket was a little fatty (some parts were inedible) and given that the portions weren't that great...that was a little disappointing. 

This place can accommodate larger groups (was here for a friend's bday and we were seated upstairs) however, it was a bit of a squeeze and there was no room to put your coats. Being winter and all, this was a bit of a nuisance. The seats (that were not against the wall which had booth-like seats) were backless so, we all ended up piling our jackets and bags or siting on our coats. Hopefully no one was gassy...haw haw. Also...the surface area of the tables themselves were not that big so, that became an issue because a lot of us ordered the sampler...instead of everything coming on a large platter, the meats and sides came out individually. 

Another criticism would be the thin metal plates so, the food was not piping hot...it was a little cold when it reached our table. Being a group of 15+ may have also contributed to the temperature of the food as well.

The waiting staff were extremely pleasant and helpful when it came to providing recommendations.

Definitely coming back though!"}
{"text":"What can i say:\" this is the first time i tried ribs -ever- and I'm so glad it was at smoque N' bones\". We were in town for a conference and this first dinner in Toronto was memorable. If you like smoked meats, excellent sides, and great memories of an immersive dining experience then you must GO!

The ambiance is spot on. Crates for bar shelves, pickled veggies (ala Chicago style giardeniera that you can order), an excellent selection of beers (craft draughts and delicious bottled brews), chefs handing out samples to taste (sit at the bar for this), soundz that play loud enough to stimulate and yet remain muted to pass as backdrop music, and the FOOD!

Try the corn (done right with cheese and smoked paprika), fries, brisket sandwich, mac n cheese, 19-hour smoked pulled pork, ribs, and chicken. 

Chef Alex is an excellent host so be sure to get his attention when you're there! Next time i'm in Toronto, I'm definitely going back"}
{"text":"Smoque N Bones is a great hangout place with yummy BBQ and the highlights were the dishes.   You can smell the deep rich smoke as soon as you walk in. 
We got the sampler for 2 special $48.50 and we picked: ribs,  brisket, and chicken plus 3 sides.   We had coleslaw,  pickled veggies,  and Mac and cheese plus a southern style poutine with cured bacon and jalapeño peppers as an extra order bc I am a sucker for poutine--it was so worth it. 

If you like Ribs with the dark crusty char aka bark then this is the place for you.   I liked the ribs but it wasn't blow my mind off kinda ribs bc I like a fall off the bone and tender style meat with a slightly sweeter sauce.   We had side ribs that had a decent amount of meat but lacked juiciness (not implying they were dry)  it just takes more work to get the meat off and you would need to apply more sauce to add back the juiciness.   I would describe their flavour profile as Smokey and tangy with a red burgundy colour.   It's served in a small tin cup plus a mini brush and if you like a lot of sauce this cup might not be enough. The style of bbq is more of an American southern style receipe- if you like a sweet flavour profile then this place won't impress you.   I personally was looking forward to the brisket but they were extremely disappointing.   I was expecting thick juicy slabs of sliced meat with some fat bc that's how I've been served when I go down south.   Instead I got thin shavings that looked like roast beef and it lost all of the tender and juiciness.  The best part of the platter was the chicken bc it had the intense smoke with the crispy skin yet the meat was still tender. 

Overall the group of 10 of us liked the atmosphere and food,  flavour and quality but it was a bit expensive for $18 for 1/2 rack compared to rib fest prices or the US dinning experiences.   The sampler for 2 is the best value on the menu if you want to try a lot of the different meats. 

The sides was the highlight for me. Especially the coleslaw bc it was creamy with a hint of tang (I wonder if they used yogurt) and it had a slight sprinkle of dill which brightens the dish.   It was so appetizing that we ordered 2.   The Mac and cheese was more gourmet than places with a white cheese sauce served with a garlic and crunchy bread crumb top. 

I would go back for the sides and try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Alex the owner came right up to my gf and I and introduced himself.  It's always nice to meet the head chef and owner of a place!  He was very nice and gave us an order of bbq sausage on the house.   

The food is fantastic!  The sides are so good we can never decide which 3 to get for the sampler.  It's so much food but it's so good you can't stop eating.  Cool vibe, great service and even better food.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My god, is this place good. I have had a variety of barbecue throughout the city, and Smoque n' Bones has to be the best. 

The atmosphere of the place fits entirely with the BBQ vibe and feels very warm and cozy. For a bonus experience, sit at the bar and watch as they prepare everything. You may even get a sample or two. 

The platters for two are the best for a variety of meats and sides. We got about three of them for a birthday and made sure to get about one of everything. The pulled pork and ribs are outstanding. The sausage is mouthwatering and highly underrated. The brisket is great. They don't skimp on sides either. The cornbread is my favourite with the maple butter, but the onion rings, Brussels sprouts are a close second.

Try the maple bacon bourbon. Amazing. Best drink I've ever had. 

Go there. Now."}
{"text":"This is the best #BBQ place in downtown Toronto. If you stop in here you need to try their brisket. It is the best in the planet!"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner last night and it was great.  One of our friends is severely allergic to all seafood, I know this is a barbeque place, however a lot of barbeque sauces have Worchestersire sauce in them which contains anchovies. 
The owner of the restaurant was actually there and he was extremely kind and reviewed all of his recipes and assured us that they were completely seafood free! He took his time and was very kind and understanding. 
The food was outstanding and Brussels sprouts were amazing."}
{"text":"I recommend the place ! We ordered this tender and juice beef brisket, sweet potato plus an amazing grilled corn."}
{"text":"It tastes fine but compared to other BBQ joints it doesn't hold a candle. Not worth the calories. Last time I ordered I received about 70$ worth of burnt ribs. Never again."}
{"text":"My review is based on the take out. We ordered from smoque and bones via hurrier. 

The food arrived quick and was still hot (including the pie). We ordered pulled pork sandwiches, mac and cheese, baked beans, house cut chips and the chorizo and the pecan pie. It was all amazing. Literally no complaints! And the prices are great! 

This is my new favourite BBQ spot in the city. Can't wait to try more!"}
{"text":"I Love this place. The food is amazing and the drinks are unique. I just wish there was a little less fatty :-)

It's a great place to eat with your hands, share food with your friends and just enjoy your time. The staff are friendly but at times it seems like they are overwhelmed, because they're long delays in service even if you asked for a glass of water. Also I wish they would open up upstairs more often, it's a great atmosphere up there.

I specially like their selection for two option. It lets you try many different plates, but I have to say it is far too much food for two people even if you're famished. It can easily feed 3 to 4 people."}
{"text":"I decided to have my birthday at Smoque n Bones ( we were really impressed with the food, drinks and staff after my husband had his birthday there back in September)And it was just amazing,everyone had a great time, enjoyed the atmosphere and quality of the place ... The staff were very attentive! Bartender made amazing cocktails! And don't let me get started on the food! From the ribs  through the short rib to the chicken sandwich everything was mind blowing!  
Definitely one of my favourite spots in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Atmosphere was very rustic and modern. The staff was also very friendly. I got the pulled pork mac and cheese and fries. They give you a crap ton of fries c:"}
{"text":"This rating reflects the quality of service, not the quality of food which was good, albeit pricey. 

We had a bad experience because the waitstaff are mismanaged, unorganized, and could care less. After ordering an appetizer, an hour later we asked if our mains were on the way and found out they hadn't been entered. This could have been handled better and avoided this shitty review..instead we ended up paying the full $75 for our bill and got our food in 'to-go' containers. In retrospect we should have just left. Will NOT be going back.. too bad because even in luke-warm containers the food is still good. 

Who's the manager at this place? Couple of suggestions for that person if they exist: get more line cooks  started before the dinner rush..train your staff in handing over tables at the end of their shift..policy should be that if a table has waited for over an hour adjust their bill! 

Going to try one of the other 85 bbq places in TO..byeeeeee!"}
{"text":"Came here with my sister and it was delicious. We had a bit of everything, pulled pork Mac and cheese, riblet's, chicken, corn bread, potato salad and sweet potato fries. Ok so basically we had all the sides but it was SO DAMN DELICIOUS. I had a Cesar as my drink and it came with delicious candied bacon and spicy bean. We finished the meal with their pecan pie, it was tasty minus the side of rosemary gelato. The place is small and I highly recommend making a reservation, we went on a Sunday and I couldn't believe how busy it was. And because it's pretty small it felt really cramped but really it's all about the food right?"}
{"text":"The consistency and quality of SnB is amazing. Absolutely the best ribs in the city. Great vibe, great music and the food is just amazing. The attention they put into their sides is to be commended. This is a staple in our go to favorites!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waited 45 minutes for food. Place wasn't even full. Food was good but not worth the wait. We were promised food within a certain time but they did not live up to that promise. Seems like they prioritized foodora rather than in restaurant customers"}
{"text":"I went here with my girlfriend for some good BBQ and cocktails and this place did not disappoint on either front!

We had the sampler for two - a choice of three meats and three sides. We chose the smoked chicken, brisket, and ribs for the meat, and the mac n cheese, collared greened, and onion rings. All of the meats were not only wonderfully cooked, but asp all came with a brush and extra bbq sauce in case you wanted to \"paint\" your food with extra flavour. I'm not gonna lie, it was a lot of fun. In short, the meats were excellent. Would be interested in trying their pulled pork.  The sides were great - my girlfriend thought the collared greens were less than stellar (I liked it) and I though the mac n cheese was just mediocre (she liked) but a) I think we both agreed that the home made hot sauce made everything better (a really terrific hot sauce), and b) we both definitely agreed that the onion rings were top notch.

As for drinks, I had the Smoque Caesar, which was just fantastic Caesar. Jalapeño infused vodka, smoke flavouring, and a lot of Worcester sauce, with some pickled veggies for garnish. Just really tasty, I had two!

One small thing to be aware is that this is a mid of a precarious place to go in the winter. If you sit too close to the door, you get cold when the door opens. However, because it's a smoke house that means that there is a vent that blasts cold air near the back of the restaurant. And since it's not a very big place it can be difficult to avoid being cold. That said, in spring and autumn the door thing won't make a difference and in the summer the vent thing might even be a boon."}
{"text":"My favorite bbq bar none.  The pork ribs are amazing, well seasoned without being overly saucy.  Full disclosure that's all I ever order so can't comment on the other dishes.  I've tried dozens of different bbq places throughout the US and who would have thought the best pork ribs are in toronto!  Can I give a place six stars?  Just wish my cardiologist would let me come more often."}
{"text":"Having lived in the south, my wife and I have developed a real taste for BBQ. We came here on a Monday night when many of the small bbq joints are closed. Luckily got seats at the bar as it turned out. Would like to give it 3.5 stars as it is close to being exceptional. 

Bought the sampler:
Brisket- a little dry and lean - and thus missing some flavour. Hard to get excellent brisket in Toronto in my experience. seems to be low on the bbq priority list. 
Pulled pork - okay as it should be. My wife's fave and she enjoyed it. 
Ribs - the real reason to eat here apparently and we will return for them alone. Excellent dry rub. Not fall off the bone style- very,very tasty. 
Beans-  excellent
Mac n cheese. We were split on this. It has a strongly flavoured cheese in it- Gruyere? - that you either love or not. One of us is a bit more traditionalist. The other loved it, and got most of the portion. 

Since this meal is for sharing and there are 2 sides, a slightly more generous portion might be appropriate- at least on the 2 we ordered. 

Watching the gentleman handle the cooking and plating was very entertaining and should give one confidence on how the food is handled in this place. The ultimate multi-tasker, and was constantly cleaning between plates and handled the food efficiently but professionally. 

The tin plates used are cool looking, but I noticed that the sides all cooled off within minutes of being served, and were cold within about 10 minutes or less. Serving on such an efficient heat conductor not such a good idea IMO.  

Service was quick and efficient on a busy evening. We will return and try some of the other sides - with the ribs."}
{"text":"Went there twice as we didn't have the best experience the first time, and unfortunately the second time was no different.

Got the dinner for two, and I gotta tell ya, the portion sizes are incredibly small. We paid almost $60 and we're still wondering what for.

Will not go back a third time."}
{"text":"Alex the bartender is a class act dude!!!! Really passionate about the craft. He made my Toronto trip the best by suggesting all the cool hip things to do it town. Not only are the drinks good, the food is great too. Come on in an sit at the bar with your noms and enjoy a hand crafted whiskey cocktail with the beautiful Alex!"}
{"text":"Came for a date night with the hubby.

Food ***
Everything we tried was really flavourful, but I disappointed with how small the portions were for the price. Loved the BBQ sauce but the smoked ribs themselves had too much burnt gristle for my taste.

Atmosphere****
Great little spot to go for a date. Not much room for parties larger than 4 people. You definutely leave smelling of the aromas of smoked bbq.

Service*****
Staff were super attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We got seats at the bar so it was fun watching the chefs at work too."}
{"text":"I love this place, discovered it shortly after its grand opening through a friend. Great staff, atmosphere and even better food. Head chef and owner Alex Rad has perfected his ribs and sauce. He actually serves them dry with the sauce on the side accompanied with a brush. This way you can add as much or little as you like. I also love the corn bread, its served with a sugary/cinnamon butter and its divine. If you sit at the bar you get to see how all the magic happens which I always enjoy doing. Everything I have tried on the menu I have loved, which I am pretty sure is more or less everything.

Best BBQ joint in TO!!!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but the service is awful. I would not recommend this place for large groups (despite what the website says). The Peppercorn Beef was really good but our food was actually cold and they only had 1 server for 3 groups of 15+. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Seriously incredible food and drink, and dedicated owners. I had a pulled pork sandwich, onion rings, and a bourbon sour. The pulled pork was actually the best PP sandwich I've had anywhere - and I have eaten and made a lot of BBQ. Portion-wise it wasn't mammoth, but was still overflowing with bark (!!!) and this amazing slaw. The sauce was perfectly in proportion to the rest of the ingredients, which is always a good touch. 

Then there's the onion rings. I'm a bit more of a fan of thick battered ones, but they were tasty as hell. The seasoning was next level. But most impressive was the owner coming by, noticing the portion wasn't up to his standards, and having them remade for us. 

They're dialing in their game but in so many ways it's already stellar. The bourbon sour was well-made and balanced in that delicate way that makes you never notice how fast you're drinking, and I've been assured that sazerac will be on the menu next time I'm by :) Their mixed drinks are priced fair, and believe it or not I didn't even get to looking at the bourbon list, so I guess I'll have to update this with that later. 

Also, I've just moved to queen west, and I'm realizing there are precious few places like this here where you can get both really good food and drink for reasonable prices. Normally it's full-on sit down restaurants, bars with super average food, or places where pitchers can be ordered in large quantities. SnB nails it: a place I would take a date or a friend for a really fine evening of food and drink, and with a sincere commitment to making the best of both, all served without pretense."}
{"text":"Hell yeah! it's all good here; they do it right. Close your eyes and you'd swear you were in Memphis sitting next to the king himself."}
{"text":"Food: 8/10
Atmosphere: 7.5/10 
Service: 8/10
Overall experience: 8/10

Went for a friend's birthday party. If you are looking for a great place to host a lot of people, they will provide you the entire upstairs. Fantastic as it has its own bar, and you are able to be as loud as you want!

Truth be told I was not looking forward to eating here. BBQ has never been my thing, but I was pleasantly surprised when I really enjoyed the food! I managed to try a lot of items, as two pairs of people each shared the \"sampler for two\" (Comes with 3 meats and 3 sides - great for your first time!). Highlights were: peppercorn beef and the pork ribs. Onion rings were good as well. 

THE BOTTOM LINE: satisfying BBQ, and a definite recommendation if you're looking to host a large party."}
{"text":"Truly a great experience. Im always curious how other chefs prepare their bbq and this place is doin it right. Tang and sweetness combines with qreat quality produce can never disappoint. Surely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Food and service made for a great night out! Note: they do take credit cards (mentioning to counter what is stated in previous reviews). 

Had the platter for two to share: ribs - amazing, perfect sauce, brisket - mild, soft, yummy, different that what you see in other BBQ  spots, sausage - served with sauce and really good mustard on the side, buttermilk onion rings - DO IT, JUST WALK BY AND EAT ONION RINGS IF YOU MUST - they are the best I have ever had, beans - delicious, collard greens - cooked with a ham hock and full of flavour (wanted more).

Drinks - very good, friend had the Caesar, I had a sour of some sort.

Dessert - The Bread pudding with bourbon sauce may actually make you cry or groan or something. It was just one of those food experiences - again, best I have ever had.

Atmosphere - fun, casual, but not too casual, good vibe.

Service - attentive and tuned in, not afraid to suggest and bang on.

The whole thing made for such a nice birthday night out. We had one of those completely satisfying restaurant-as-entertainment experiences. 

Price - 3 drinks, shared platter, dessert (to share) - 95 before tip"}
{"text":"Their most expensive menu, the full rack of baby back ribs were extremely dry. I felt like I was chewing a rubber. Maybe it was supposed to be dry. I'm not a rib expert so maybe the baby back ribs were supposed to be dry. I was going to try out their side ribs to see the difference but I was scared that I might get the $34 rubber. But wait, how come the ribs selling in The Keg are somewhat juicier and tender compared to this place's. I know they don't make the greatest ribs in the world so what's going on. Is it because they use side ribs and side ribs are supposed to taste better than the baby back ribs? I'm confused so educate me.
Also tried their Cobb salad and bacon had this odor that I could immediately tell it wasn't fresh."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto!

Right when you walk in, the smell from the open cooked meat is a mouth watering experience.  In the summer, the front has a garage like door that opens up to the street and really helps create a Toronto experience like no other.  The second floor has a nice open setting and great selection of fine whisky.

The food is incredible. Each time I have went, my brother has shown me how sharing everything off the menu is the best option when you're with a group. They have a delicious Mac and cheese (although the portion is small, so order a couple).  The ribs are absolutely amazing and should be the first thing you order.  A real smoked taste.  The pulled pork is also a great option; it is exceptional.

Don't forget to make a reservation! I find a lot of people complain about not getting a table or something but its TORONTO! Also, one of the best spots in TORONTO.  Make a reservation, enjoy the night out with your friends or family."}
{"text":"These ribs and smoked meat are absolutely amazing!!!! Came by to try out their platter as per Yelp review and let me tell you they did not disappoint! The ribs are super tender and flavourful. Onion rings are the best I had! Fresh corn bread was so tasty with sweet butter! The staff was super friendly and their specialty cocktails were wonderful! Must try!!!"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for hipster places and this is no exception. Come here and try their ribs, this place is going to change your life.

I did not make a reservation and was lucky enough to find a spot at 7pm on a Friday night. 1st floor was pretty much filled up when I got there and although I was the only table on their 2nd floor when I started, it got absolutely full by the time I left. I would strongly recommend you to book a table.

Sampler for two for $48.99 got you 3 meats and 3 sides, in which we chose 1/2 rack, 1/2 chicken, 1/2 lb beef brisket, mac n' cheese, sweet potato waffle fries, and brussels sprouts. Server helped out with our selections, points earned here.

I was so impressed by their food. 
1. Pork ribs served hot, tender, juicy and with a chewy texture in a good way. It was just so good. I do not really like fall off bone kind of ribs so this one is just right up my alley. I absolutely enjoyed their ribs. The sauce also went very well with it.
2. Next item I got to mention is their brussels sprouts. A lot of people are not a fan of brussels sprouts mainly because many do not know how to cook with brussels and resulted in the mushy weird feeling when you chew it. Smoque n' bones made it right and took it to the next level. The sauce was tasty, savory with a hint of sweetness plus they cooked it so well that it was crispy from outside to inside. You have to try this here and change your wrong perception of brussels.
3. Lastly, I am usually not a fan of mac n' cheese because this is such a simple comfort food that a lot of places just do not give a damn to spend some time or effort to deliver a good bowl of mac n' cheese. This is not the story here. Once again, they beat my expectations. Macaronis were made al dente, right amount of cheese was mixed in. YUMMY!

Overall, absolutely amazing food, good vibes with some loud music. However, I could not give them 5 stars as the experience was not perfect. Service was a bit slow possibly due to the restaurant got crazy busy after. Also, their knifes are not at all sharp for people to cut in ribs. I mean... either people don't mind using hands to dig in or people like me just really need your knifes to eat ribs in a non-messy way. We indeed need some good knifes.

All in all, come here, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"This is the best bbq place! My boyfriend has been here numerous times & always raved about it but last night was my first time there. We had the sampler for two and had the ribs, chicken, beef brisket, Brussels sprouts, corn bread & onion rings. It was all phenomenal! The ribs & the Brussels sprouts were particularly unreal! We also drank spiked lemonades (so good!) & had deep fried Oreos for dessert. The service was great & I can't wait to go again & try more of the menu! Definitely recommend making a reservation as the seating is pretty limited. I think the tables at the front are the best but my boyfriend says that the seating at the bar is awesome as you can watch the food & drinks being prepared."}
{"text":"Excellent barbecue spot. We met the owner who recommended the sampling menu - definitely a great option to try a couple of different things. We had the pork ribs, the brisket and the pulled pork with onion rings, mac n cheese and the corn bread. I'm generally not a huge fan of cornbread but everything else was incredibly well done. Great atmosphere inside as well, kind of a tight squeeze but wasn't a problem at all. Drink menu was also very good with a solid cocktail list and a good draft beer selection."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was looking forward to trying this place. But when we got in, we sat for 2 minutes and we  could not breath . Just not ventilated enough for both of us and it was way too smoky . very small place. If I do make it around again maybe ill try take out. Rating just based on our experience of the restaurant itself not the food"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! My wife and I shared their meal for two with beef brisket, peppercorn beef, and a half chicken. All of the meats were incredible. The Mac and cheese and cornbread were amazing as well. 

Will definitely be coming back! 

Best BBQ in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Incredible Barbeque! The owner is a great guy who engaged with us at the bar the entire time. Customer service is rarely as good as he prided himself in providing to his guests. He shared his story, he spoke to our two year old son, and he seemed to communicate well with his crew. We ate his award winning BBQ Cobb Salad, Ribs and BBQ Pork Mac-n-Cheese. We messaged our friend who is coming here from the states in a few short days sharing with him this as a must have while in Toronto. If we lived here it would definitely be a regular visit."}
{"text":"It's okay. It will do the job if you have a craving but there are definitely WAY better spots in Toronto. The ribs I got were tender but they weren't fall-off-the-bone ribs. I got the shoestring fries which I liked. The portions were pretty solid. 3.25*"}
{"text":"Down south done right. Great work guys! Smoked to perfection, the ribs are really a thing of beauty. Order the buttermilk onion rings- you won't be disappointed. Cold tea is for real, and their bourbon is tops. Service is great. Once I left without getting all of my take out order, and the server ran about 400 feet down the road to catch up with me."}
{"text":"Took my cousin here as she was visiting from Saskatoon and staying in Liberty Village. It had been recommended to us by a friend, so we thought, WHAT THE HELL? Let's dive into some ribs! I'm a big fan of back ribs. So, yeah... Rib Fest? You know I'm there! I don't fancy myself a rib connoisseur, but I've eaten A LOT in my many years on this earth and I can tell you the ribs here are nothing to write home about. $36 for a full rack (you can't order 1/2), and the meat is pretty tough considering how much of it there is on the bones. 
BBQ sauce falls on the too sweet side of things.. That goes for the sauce on the Brussels sprouts as well.
Outside of the food experience, the service is friendly, but slow. I don't expect it to be fast, considering the laid-back atmosphere of the place, but we waited so long for everything. Felt bad for the Foodora delivery kid who was waiting for a takeout order the entire time we sat there (over an hour). Ask him if this was a normal pickup from this place. He told me they definitely put pickup orders on the back-burner. Not a priority. So keep that in mind if you decide to order from these guys! 
Maybe try the brisket? Just stay away from the ribs and all things rib-related. I can't give my experience more than 2 stars. 

We split the ribs, 2 small sides and 2 cocktails at $40 each plus tip."}
{"text":"Awesome pulled pork sandwich, made with care at the counter while you wait.  

Having tried some of the suburban BBQ places and rib fests, I decided to give a local joint a try.  What the downtown locations lack in portions it makes up for in polish and refinement, that give the downtown BBQ scene a much different feel than the ribfests in the suburbs, and I suspect a slightly different clientele.

I had the pulled pork sandwich with a pop for $10, with a side order of two pieces of corn bread with sweet butter ($3.90).  The pulled pork sandwich was carefully made, with the coleslaw tossed by hand by the skilled cooks at the counter.  Each ingredient is carefully prepared and then arranged on the bun to order.  The taste of the pork and the crunch of the slaw had the best execution I have tried, and the corn bread was equally as impressive.  It is a bit pricier compared to the rib fest fare, but you can see the difference in quality and refinement.

The wait staff did take a little bit longer to sort out the order, forgetting to include the pop in the combo.  Also the staff could use more training, as I overheard two waiters talk about a customer who had asked which of the house draughts had the most alcohol content, and weren't sure how to answer, so docking one star.

I would definitely come back again to try their ribs and platters in the future."}
{"text":"OMG!! I took a guest here and stole his food! That's how good the ribs here are!

I read the numerous reviews and decided to take my cousin there on his visit. We started out with their Special Old Fashioned which was so delicious and ordered their platter with pepper beef, bbq ribs and something else which I don't remember. 

The ribs came in all their glory, saucy and ready to be eaten and my god was it amazing! They were tender, juicy and I absolutely loved their sauce!

If you can't tell how much I loved this place by the number of exclamations I've used then you have to try it to believe it!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was craving some good ol BBQ and decided to give Smoque N' Bones a shot. It is located on Queen West and there is a Green P just around the corner, which is great for people who are driving from the burbs! The spot has 2 levels - the main floor is more of a bar feel but is pretty cool as they cook the food right in front of you. Upstairs is more of the \"restaurant\" floor but they play great music and it has a nice vibe. For dinner, I ordered pulled chicken Mac and cheese ($12) a half rack of smoked ribs ($19) and 1/4 pound spicy sausage ($8). The pulled chicken Mac and cheese was really good but they topped it off with a BBQ sauce but even for someone who likes a lot of sauce it was too much of it. The ribs were amazing. Smoked to perfection and falling off the bone. Make sure you ask for their hot sauce. The spicy sausage was good but nothing special. We also got the corn bread, which came with an amazing side of maple butter. The bread itself was mediocre...I've had better. Overall, this place has great service and the food is good and cost effective. You can't go wrong by checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I booked a reservation for four people at 6. They called to confirm earlier in the day which was great! Running a few minutes late, I called them and let them know. We get there and get seated in the high top tables. We ordered the sampler (3 meats and 3 sides) and let her know that we'll order more if needed. Now the server says \"your table has been spoken for at 7:30). I said pardon? I don't follow. So you're literally kicking us out at 7:30? What if we're looking to spend the evening here with drinks? 

I said no one told me this otherwise we would have gone elsewhere. Plus it's a place where you'd enjoy your food and drink and not hurry out. I couldn't believe it. 

The food came soon after and the server kept checking up on us every 10 minutes, clearing the table, asking us if we need anything else. This got so annoying! At 7:10, she comes around asks again if we need anything else, we say no. She says ok just the bill then? 

I guess they don't really want our business. Never mind. Service is shit and don't come here if you want to stay a little bit longer. 

Come on now. There are plenty of other Queen West places we could go to, shitty service isn't part of it."}
{"text":"Great bbq resto around the Trinity-Bellwoods area. They have a decent drink menu of bourbon-based cocktails and the typical BBQ menu. We ordered the half rack of ribs, 1/4 lb of beef brisket, collard greens and the mac and cheese.  It was just the right amount of food without feeling incredibly bloated afterwards.  The ribs were fantastic. Very flavourful and tender.The collard greens were well cooked and the mac and cheese was delicious. They used a good blend of cheeses for the mac+cheese. The beef brisket was not as tasty and soft as I would have liked. Not sure if it was because they were closing early and it was the last remaining brisket, but it was just ok. Anyways, I'll be back again."}
{"text":"We had reservations and we were a table of 5.

We came for the bourbon and they didn't actually have a list or menu of what they had available for us, just the cocktail menu.  That defeated the purpose of us going out to a bourbon bar.

Service Cons:  
Slow service - our food didn't come out at the same time, a few dishes at a time over 1 hr and 40 minutes.  We were getting 2 samplers and more, but we were expecting to receive most things at one time.  We were never asked if we wanted more drinks, we had to call the server over to ask for more drinks ourselves, ask for water and call the server to remind them of the food we hadn't yet received (3 times) and called the server over to request dessert and then again for the bill.  The server was very pleasant but incredibly overworked as the place was packed and he seemed like he was the only one on the floor.  Didn't feel like we were being taken care of at all.  

Food Cons:
Ribs were burnt and dry.  This was past the point of charred on purpose.
Pulled pork was bland and dry.
Incredibly small servings.  We ordered tonnes of food and still weren't full at the end of the meal because portions were miniscule.  A few tablespoons of coleslaw and beans at a $3.90 serving was just ridiculous.  Though corn bread was good and moist, you got 2 tiny little pieces as a serving.
Coleslaw just takes like cabbage in sour cream with lots of dill.
Pecan pie - meh and overpriced.
Collard greens were bland.

Pros:  BBQ sauce is amazing.  Both beef dishes were juicy and tasty.  Sausages and chicken were good. Onion rings were outstanding.  Sweet potato fries were delicious.  Pudding really moist and delicious.   

The food was good.  Not great, not bad.  Just good.  But for the price, servings were small and it didn't seem worth it when we got the bill and we weren't that full and frustrated at the lack of service.  Don't expect a quick meal and be ready to fork out the cash just to fill your belly.  

Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was an instant fan of this place following the yelp event that happened here.

Since then I have been meaning to come back.

Seating is limited for groups but it is not a problem if in a group of 2/3 as the seats at the bar/bbq area are just fine.

Onion rings! I could eat these all day. Buttersquash coating, just super.

Their ribs are great, but the chicken wings although cooked to perfection could be hotter. 

The place is usually busy and they play some great country style music which gets you in a great mood.

Big fan of this place, will come back for their brunch."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this queen west spot and we pass by so often but usually it's dinner time and I didn't get around to making reservations. Be warned: it would be a long wait for a table without reservations during dinner service. Today tho, we had the day off to spend some time with a cousin from NY. She was only here for the day, so we decided to go for lunch and walk around downtown a little..we called ahead and were told that we can walkin anytime before dinner. So we headed over. 
Upon arrival, there were 3 other tables with people on the main floor. I'm not sure about upstairs. We got a table by the window. We were sitting right by the speakers and the music was very loud. I'm not sure if someone said something but by time we looked over the menu it was better and we could actually talk. 

To start we ordered the rib tips. We initially were getting the wings but the table behind us got the rib tips and it looks and smelt really good and saucy. So we immediately switched the order.
We also ordered drinks -whiskey sour, ceasar and bourbon lemonade. The drinks were really tastey except there wasnt much alcohol in it cause... I didn't taste any or felt anything. So that was a bit disappointing and hence why they lost a star :( 

The rib tips were just as we expected. Fried in batter and then smothered in wings sauce. It was good and we were glad we switched. 

For mains we decided to get the platter for two. We got the brisket, pulled pork and sausages. Sides was corn, onion rings and sweet potato waffles fries. PS- the website says its $48 but in the resto menu it is actually $52. Just an fyi.
Honestly... It was all delicious. 

I was half expecting it all to be smothered in BBq sauce and salty or too sweet or too much vinegar. But the meats were actually done perfectly. Nothing dry. The sauce was on the side. The sausages had a nice sweet/spicy glaze. The brisket was perfectly sliced and moist so no tough peices. It was very good. The sides didn't disappoint either. The corn was delicious, I could eat just that and be happy. The waffle fries were good too, I love sweet potatoes so couldn't go wrong. The onion rings I didn't try but Dave and our guest really liked it. It was quite alot of food. Thinking back on it, I thought it was very little. But turns out we couldn't even finish it. We had to takeaway. 

Won't lie....i ate the leftovers for dinner...

I'm really glad I got to try this place after so many people I know have raved about it. The bill was $105 for 3 people  (not including tip)."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. The facility is a bit on the small side so you might need to wait a while for a seat if it's crowded. But it is definitely worth the wait. We had the sampler - pulled pork, 1/2 rack of ribs, and beef brisket. It was all delicious and I would definitely come back if I'm in this area."}
{"text":"A new, very good addition to Toronto's growing BBQ scene. It appears that everyone is starting to get on the smoked meat and cocktail bandwagon - and Smoque N' Bones, while one of the newest in the game, have got it nailed down!

I will note that while the star rating above is 4, the experience on my last visit likely warrants them a high 3 almost a 4, this having to do with customer service issues when they credit/debit system went down. As opposed to doing hand bills or doing manual credit card payments (with the old slider/carbon copy system), our server just kinda sighed a lot and tried to make us feel bad about not wanting to go to the closest $3 ATM to take out cash (let it be known that by the time that happens, there is another $5 in fees taken out on the back end). We held firm and the manager/chef, not trying to hide his displeasure, begrudgingly called visa and had them do phone charges.

Aside from making us feel uncomfortable about money, the food part of the evening was great. They're presently trying to rework their Maple Bacon Old Fashioned ($12) recipe, we tried it, and it wasn't very good so I'd avoid ordering this cocktail in particular until they've worked out the kinks.

To eat, I went with the 1/2 rack of Ribs, corn bread w/ honey butter, and mac N' Cheese. I got to try the Onion Rings off a friends plate, and a few of us shared in the Deep fried shrimp Appetizer. All of the food was INCREDIBLE. Perfectly cooked, seasoned and overall amazing!

So in summary, they lose a full mark for making the post dining experience pretty uncomfortable, and a 0.5 marks for their unfinished cocktail, but I round up to 4/5 because the venue is cool and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place knows BBQ! Ordered the platter which allows you to pick 3 meats with 3 sides. That was hard since there was so much I wanted to try. Ended up choosing the ribs, sausage and brisket with mac and cheese, coleslaw and shoestring fries. 

Ribs and sausage were amazing. The best I've had in the city so far. Not even a huge fan of sausage and I wanted more. The flavour is enriched with smokiness and cooked to perfection. I like how they give you a brush so you can control how much BBQ sauce you want to have (homemade sauce BTW).

Cant believe the service in this place. We were given samples of the pulled pork and smoked pastrami. I almost died it was so delicious. All staff were helpful and friendly.

If you haven't eaten here you're definitely missing out.

Tips:
- sit at the bar, here you can watch the food being prepared and talk to the cool staff
- don't order coleslaw as a side since it comes with the sausage
- bring cash since this place isn't hooked up with machines yet

Only flaw: cocktails are on the sweeter side

Inside scoop: brunch menu is coming at the end of he month. Can't wait"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ in Toronto! 
I came here with my S/O and we shared the sampler platter it was delicious!
Recommendation sides for the sampler platter:
* Mac and Cheese
* Corn
* Sweet potatoes fries
Recommendation meats:
* Chicken
* Ribs
* Beef Brisket
The portions for the sampler platter are also decent and will keep you satisfied."}
{"text":"Pretty good southern style bbq here.  My friend and I tried the sampler for 2.  For our choices of meat, we went with the ribs, pulled pork, and peppercorn beef.  And for our sides, we tried the collard greens, pickled veggie jar, and shoestring fries.

The meat dishes were fine although a little over-charred for my personal tastes and because of that, they lacked the juiciness that I was looking for.  The sides though were great.  The shoestring fries were fried perfectly, the collard greens were great (I hate it when collard greens are cooked to the point of mush, the greens here still had some texture to them), and the pickled veggie jar cut through the richness of the meat nicely.  Warning though, the pickled veggie jar is intensely vinegary which is something that I was fine with since I thought it complimented the bbq well for my taste buds.  But I could see it being off-putting for some."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place.  Short staff and clueless waitress. Just very sloppy service all around.  They couldn't decide where to put us and made us move twice.  We ended up back at our original seat because the 2 waitress couldn't decide where to seat the other party.  Awkward.  The food itself wasn't that good either I had much better BBQ elsewhere.  The half chicken was super burnt so was the ribs.  The Mac & cheese and corn was the best thing I had all night.  Oh ya they also forgot my sweet potatoes waffle fries.  Not going to come back here especially having to wait for an hr for this."}
{"text":"I got takeout via Foodora, and food came very fast (delivered within 15 minutes), which makes me believe that it wasn't made to order. I was right.

The beef brisket for 1/4 cost $18 but it's 3 small slices, and very thinly sliced, and dry. The brisket tastes like its been out for days, and not kept in the right temperature. It's not good.

The collard greens are tasteless. Needs more salt, and more fat. 

The beans were the best bit, but if anyone can screw up baked beans, they're in trouble.

Overall, I'd rather wait an hour for food prepared ON ORDER, then eat this imo."}
{"text":"Really good ribs, maybe the best I've tried in Toronto. Would have rated 4 or maybe even 5 stars, but just had a pretty bad service experience.

After ordering desserts and and waiting for 15+ minutes, I asked a server to check in on the order. She comes back and just says it'll be out in a few minutes without any explanation. When the bread pudding finally arrived, I asked her straight up, so did you guys just forget the order or something? And she says, \"oh yeah, someone forgot to put it\" in and walked away, and it was just left at that, I don't think she even said sorry.

Most restaurants comp something when they forget to put in an order for that long. I'm not saying they needed to do that or anything, but man, at least own up to it and be a little apologetic when you forget a customer's order."}
{"text":"80 dollars and no dessert and no coffee do not cume here  no toothpick and charged me for dessert that was given to somebody else and then charge me 18% tip will never go here ever again"}
{"text":"Nice bohemian atmosphere Smokehouse. Ordered up the 1/2 rack of ribs, Mac and cheese, and cornbread. The ribs were excellent, straight out of the smoker and onto the grill for a bit of char.  Corn bread was served up in two small loaves, not overly sweet. Mac and cheese was good but would have preferred some fresh cheese on top with a quick bake to finish. 

Overall a bit pricey if ordered with separate sides but not too bad combined as a special. Would recommend."}
{"text":"I thought their appetizers and sides all looked very delicious. Their baby back ribs were tasty but I would have preferred it a little bit more juicy but overall a very solid barbecue place. I would recommend any of their fried items."}

{"text":"This place is amazing. I absolutely love the food. Everything is so tasty. Sometimes I feel bad for the staff because the owner guy seems like a dick and a nightmare to work for. He shamelessly barks at everyone in front of customers. Can't stay away from this place though. It's the best BBQ in the city."}
{"text":"Nice and saucy.

The awesome: Service. The gentleman cutting the meat at the bar offered us tasters of everything. 

The (kinda) bad. Not so kid friendly and the space is designed a bit tight. 

I was hoping for the ribs to be a bit softer and this is why I took a star off today.

A great destination when craving some serious bbq."}
{"text":"Smoque N Bones is the tastiest barbecue house I've had in Toronto.

I had a hard time rating this restaurant. The food's really good, but my experience had some glaring holes. At the end, I settled for 3 stars but I still recommend others to try it for themselves. 

As a first-timer, we figured that ordering from their sampler would cover all our bases. From reading Yelp, we figured the sampler isn't very big so we decided to order an extra order of sausage and beef brisket. (Total overkill but we were pretty hungry haha)

We ordered: 

Beef Brisket- Wasn't very big in portion. We got like 3 slices for 1/4 lb... do you know what this strongly reminded me of? The beef brisket you get at pho restaurants. It wasn't very good... I'm not sure why everyone talked about this on Yelp. 2/5

House Sausage- This meat was okay. Wasn't spicy. Wasn't amazing. I've had better from M&M meatshops to be honest. 2.5/5

Ribs- Okay this is where Smoque n bones shines. Their ribs are AMAZING. If you're going to come here, you must get the ribs. Get these. 5/5

Chicken- We figured that it would just be regular rotisserie chicken. Well... we weren't wrong lol. It was just chicken, but to be fair, they did do it very well. I'll have to recommend this if you just order the sampler. It's easily the most filling meat and without this, I can easily see why people leave here hungry. 3/5.

Pulled Pork- Delicious! Pulled pork is great from here! I've had their pulled pork sandwiches off UberEats before, and this was exactly like it. 4.5/5. 

Mac n Cheese - Best Mac n Cheese I've ever had. Ever. Cheese is flavourful without being heavy. Not sure how they did it. 4.5/5.

Onion rings - BEST onion rings I've ever had. Thin. Huge portions. DELICIOUS. Get these! 5/5.

Sweet potato waffle fries - Delicious waffle fries! I'm not the biggest fan of sweet potato but even I loved these ones. 4.5/5. 

Like other people have said, Smoque n Bone's sides really are better than their meats. It's not a knock on their meats... it's just that their sides are THAT GOOD. 

My biggest gripe against this place is the service. I had some huge problems with their service when we went. 

1) My server disappeared for an hour. We had no idea where he went. Upstairs? Not sure. We were originally missing the beef brisket from our order. It took us over an hour for us to inform him to complete our order. Didn't check up on us once for our entire stay.

2) What's with their number of delivery orders? I understand that it's a big part of your business, but really slowed down your ability to serve your guests. We were really hungry when we sat down, and it was really painful to see all the food they were preparing in front of us to be boxed up in Foodora packages. We waited 30 mins to get our first item.

3) The seating at the bar is nice, but can get really uncomfortable with all the smoke coming up and hitting your faces. We were quite a distance away, and I was still bothered by the amount of smoke coming from the grill. This is a problem similar to KBBQ. Sit away from the bar if you don't like the smells. 

It's not a date environment. Come with friends. I would likely not come back for anything else but the ribs and the onion rings. It's great for a guys night out, but it's not friendly enough for any groups bigger than 6. I was happy with dinner, but has lots of room for improvement."}
{"text":"Food was great! We had a sample of everything on the menu and the only issue is that the sausages were a bit salty. Would definitely go again though."}
{"text":"FOOD (4 stars)
Smoque N' Bones was on my bookmarks for a while.  Today we came with another couple.  Our group was four people.  We ordered only 1 SAMPLER FOR TWO, which was $59.99.  We chose  1/2 PORK RIBS RACK, ¼ peppercorn BEEF,  1/2 lb. SAUSAGES and three sides were BRUSSELS SPROUTS, BUTTERMILK ONION RINGS and GRILLED CORN.  We also added on Rib tips and Cornbread. I love almost of all dishes.  They were DELICIOUS!  I was just a bit sad about the grilled corn.  They were quite small and dry in my opinion. However, I really want to try other dishes.  Their side dishes look very interesting.  I saw the table next to us ordered the Sweet potato waffle fries. They seemed to like it a lot.  
 
Drinks (4 stars)
I got my fave \"BLOODY CAESAR.\"  I'm a light weight person.  This drink was so good and made me turn red! lol
My friend and my husband had SWEET TEA, Lemonade, Can-Woodhouse and a pint of Sam Adams.  I was sure they didn't have any problem with those drinks because they vanished!
 
SERVICE (2 stars)
Sad sad sad.  Upset and upset.  The waiter seemed very impatient.  We didn't spend much time to order. He didn't even wait for a minute.  He really wanted to leave all the time.  We knew that you were busy, but it annoyed us too when our server didn't care to take an order or give us a warm welcoming.  We were not here for only food.  We all expect a pleasant service in return for giving the restaurant business.  They might be short of staff or be too busy because of take-out?  I hope they would improve their service if they care about their customers.
 
AMBIANCE (3.5 stars)
They have two floors, but they didn't open the upper floor on the day we went.  We got the seat next to the opened window.  The weather was nice during the day so it was very nice for us. It wasn't loud so we could talk normally.  No need to shout to each other like some other places.
 
PRICE (3 stars)
 
OVERALL (4 stars) tasty food but poor service."}
{"text":"Wow everything here was 5 star no exception. We were allowed to sit walk in right at front ledge / counter facing queen. Open concept which was lovely on this sunny day. Our dog was allowed to be tied on inner doorway and no one said anything when she broke loose and ran inside a bit,no one judges and they just said \"dog on the loose \" and no one squawked at us.they even brought our dog a dish of water and a rib to snack on - very sweet! Our waiter was very charming Australian guy who was fast and attentive and very conversational and didn't mind my questions about wheres he from etc. The food was amazing and great deal at 3 mains and 3 sides for about 59 to shares for two people aNd after we were stuffed for day. Flavour of the food was scrumptious and and had great flavour. Each dish was unique and had an assortment of sauces to pit with it. I cannot say enough great things. We were treated with such kindness and Luna (our dog) too! I can't comment on cocktails because i maintained with beers on tap, which they have a good selection of but it seemed they have a decent selection of 2 oz cocktails as well. Beer is standard pricing, pints are average, cocktails are high price range but they are 2 oz.

Note our dog even came and lay down in restaurant and  was given a lot of love as well! I can tell this'll be a new regular hangout and am pumped for it!"}
{"text":"This place gets better each time I visit. I'm in the 6 monthly now to visit my gf and this place is fortunately right around the corner. It seems busier than my last visits so maybe the word is out about this joint! The owner, Alex, remembers us and he is so hands on with every dish that comes out..we were seated at the bar so I got to see everything up close. For dinner we had: beet salad, corn on the cob, Brussels sprouts, 1/4 ribs, pulled chicken sandwich& mac'n'cheese. Everything was awesome! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good, would go back again for their ribs. Although it is getting pricey now compared to before where they had the special for $25 get ribs and 2 sides. I didn't see them doing it anymore."}
{"text":"Perfect BBQ food. Quick and tasting options at a reasonable price. Everything is made fresh and right in front of your eyes. The only minor issue is that it could get a bit warm inside but that is not a concern"}
{"text":"This is such a difficult review to write because overall my experience at S n B was lovely - and I left with a really positive feeling - but I don't know that I'd be in a rush to be back?...and usually for me to give a place a \"4\", I'd have to add it my list of places I'd want to frequent.

I had called in and made a reservation (big plus that they take them) seated at the bar, in front of the bartender - that's an important distinction because the whole place is basically \"bar\" seating, stools facing some sort of action.  When we got there, the hostess told us they'd sat someone in our seats so it'd be a bit.  This was just an odd thing...the whole place was basically empty, but the four seats in the front of the bartender were taken.  \"We took a walk-in and he's just taking a little longer then we thought,\"she said, which was ALSO strange, because why wouldn't you put the walk-in anywhere else? literally?  I also looked over and the dude had a full pint in front of him...not a good sign.

Now, I get it.  I work in the restaurant industry - they could have given him an out time, but he was still there, ordered another, yadda yadda yadda.  but it didn't super impress me.  We sat down and I kept my coat on, as we debated whether to stay or go.

Now,here's where S n B did their duty.  They were SUPER kind, OVER apologetic, and even bought us a round of drinks (which, to be fair, basically had no alcohol in them but were SUPER tasty).  It's tiny gestures like that that separate the sucky restaurants from the great ones - and for that, I was not only thankful, but impressed.

Once we sat in the original seats we had requested, we had to laugh - they were FREEZING cold.  A fan has to pump out A/C to combat the heat from the smoker in the small space,so they can't even control it -- but that's Murphy's Law...or karma? Something....haha....anyway, we didn't want to more annoying than we already had been, so we stayed put.

If you calculate the price of the \"sampler for 2\", you'll see it'll depend what you choose to order whether it really is a \"deal\" or not.  I don't like that, it should be an obvious choice, not one where you are only saving a buck or so.  Anyway, we went with it, and had the chicken (good), ribs (good) and brisket (good).  For sides, we had collard greens, mac n cheese, and onion rings - onions rings soooo good.

Overall, the food was good, but not AMAZING - mac n cheese wasn't warm, the collard greens didn't have the usual bitterness I'd expect, and the same BBQ sauce was serve with all three proteins.  I did however LOVE their homemade spicy sauce - really great.  The drinks tasted amazing but my second drink apparently had 2.5 oz in it and I didn't feel a thing....maybe it's the insane amount of meat we were eating, but I still usually feel that.

So, in short: great service, good food and drink, but something just wasn't quite a fit for me.  I do give them major props for customer service and always keeping a smile"}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations in every way!  Went with a group to celebrate a birthday (upstairs)  cocktails were fantastic,  and food even better if that's possible!  Will definitely be back!  Try the rib tips:)"}
{"text":"Believe the reviews!!!! Very good and hot delicious BBQ!    Service was excellent and staff was friendly! We got the feed 2 sampler with beef ribs, chicken and peppercorn beef that melted in my mouth! Sides were good. They give a lot of food and the price was fair and reasonable."}
{"text":"I am IN LOVE with this place! Went in after work on a Thursday at around 4, and the place was relatively empty. Me and my friend nabbed a table by the open windows and ordered away, thanks to our quick and friendly server.

My somewhat picky friend ordered the smoked chicken sandwich and she very much enjoyed it. 

The ribs I had were juicy, tender, smoky and absolutely delicious. I enjoy my ribs with a little bit more of a bite/chew vs the fall-of-the-bone variety, and I found the texture of the ribs to be perfection!  Paired with their barbecue sauce, and that smoky charred-ness, I can have 4 more order of those and lick the bones dry. My inner carnivore was very much satisfied.

The buttermilk onion rings were deeelicious. I expected a heavier/thicker coating (thinking along the lines of buttermilk pancakes), but it came as a lightly coated batch of onion rings, fried extra crunchy. Very delicious.

The sweet potato waffle fries were also delicious!! I love sweet potatoes, and these waffle fries absolutely made my day. Subtle earthy sweetness, fried to a perfect crisp, paired with that wonderful chipotle mayo. ALL THE NOMS!! 

The brussel sprouts and onions were very flavourful. Loved the caramelization they had on the sprouts and the caramelized onions. They tossed the sprouts in a vinaigrette of sorts, which added the acidity needed to cut the heavy fatness of the dish. Loved it!

Corn bread was beautifully presented. Dense but moist little cakelets with a cinnamon butter. I prefer my cornbread with a bit more grit, and a higher emphasis on that cornmeal flavour. So I found it a bit underwhelming. I suspect they use bacon fat in their corn bread recipe, because you taste that hint of smoky bacon in the bread. Overall, it was still very yummy. Just not in line with my personal preference.

Will definitely visit again!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large lunch for the office. I go to pick it up myself via Uber and it's not ready on time. Food was packaged so terribly that I had a big oil stain on my jeans and smelled like BBQ for the rest of the day. (I ubered to the office so there was minimal movement which shouldn't have allowed for leakage of that magnitude) Everything was covered in oil and sauce because of the packaging. We got 'bits' of pulled pork.. disgusting. While a few items were tasty, other items were straight up missing. 
I emailed the manager who offered to give us a GC for the inconvenience and mess up. I've been trying to get this GC since last year and have not received responses back to my emails. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I gave them the opp to rectify the situation before writing this review but they have failed in so many ways. Very disappointed in the food and service. I even inquired about renting the top floor for a work event and they never followed up. Not sure how businesses like this stay open. Shame."}
{"text":"We were there this week before heading to the Rick Mercer show taping!  Wow!!!  Heaven on earth....walked in and the smell of the wood fire made us feel like we were up north by a lake with a campfire!!!  The food?  FABULOUS!!!

The service was excellent and the food was so delicious, we'll be back for sure!!!  Thanks for an amazing BBQ spot in a fun part of Toronto!!!  See you and your team soon Alex!!!  Well done!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service. Better food. The corn I had was the best I've ever had. I'll definitely be back when in Toronto."}
{"text":"Flat out one of the best BBQ's you can find in the city!

Get the shared plate (~$45).   You can pick several of their meats and several of their sides.  This WILL feed 3 hungry people.  Definitely go for the ribs and watch them grill them right before your eyes.  The BBQ sauce included makes them even better.  In between \"fall off the bone\" and \"nice and meaty\".  Other recommendations - if you have a group get the sausage.  Great flavour and large portion.  The sides are also gems not to be overlooked.  Mac and cheese + candied yams.. done.

I tried the maple bacon old fashioned as well.  Nice twist, but stick to beer.

Honestly, if you don't like the food here you must be a vegetarian."}
{"text":"What a great place.   You must sit at the counter.  Not only are the cooks amazing to watch, but they interact with the staff.  The owner, Alex, was working in the kitchen and really made the night memorable.   And I haven't even mentioned the food.
We had the sampler platter (3 sides and 3 meats)  the sides were good enough to be the feature.   I loved the onion rings, beans and mac and cheese.  All the meats were great.  We were able to sample all the meats, thanks Alex...another reason to sit at the counter/bar.

The fantastic food is matched or paired with bourbon.  I had the Maple Bacon Old Fashion and a French Manhattan.  Both were good, but the Maple Bacon Old Fashion was the best drink I can remember having.   That is right Bacon!    Ask how it is made and you learn this is no easy task...all from scratch.

Loved this place and will be back!"}
{"text":"My goodness, I did not expect to find BBQ like this in Canada! I'll even admit some of my excitement may be the fact this is SO much better than expected.

I came with a co-worker during a travel job and immediately came back with my significant other when he got into Toronto the next day. He was impressed! I have family in the South (US) where BBQ is serious and this place could definitely compete!

Check out the bourbon bible! The spiked lemonade is so incredible (I mean if you like lemonade as much as I do).

I loved the mac and cheese, most of the time I don't even eat mac and cheese unless my mother, mother-in-law, or an aunt makes it ...so...please understand this means it's amazing (and it's my favorite food). The entree for 2 was still almost too much food for myself and basketball player sized SO. Never thought about  eating chipotle mayo with my sweet potato fries or every had anyone offer it, and now I wonder what's wrong with everyone in the US (because this combo is so amazing). Both visits I've had the chicken, mac and cheese, cornbread, and ribs. Sorry the cornbread has nothing on my mother in law or myself, but it is good.

The brisket though....stay away from that. That's sliced beef not brisket. Nah."}
{"text":"The BBQ is really great here. I don't usually eat ribs out, because I like the ones I make on my smoker, but both the baby backs and the beef ribs were excellent, especially the beef ribs, which you can't get everywhere. 

We sampled pretty much everything on the menu, except for the items they were out of stock of. YES, out of stock of fried chicken. SERIOUSLY. How is that even possible on a Saturday night? I get it if you're a new restaurant, but really, in my opinion, there's no excuse for running out of fried chicken by 7pm. So if it's the fried chicken you're after, call ahead.

The chicken poppers were way too salty, everyone at the table was reaching for the water after sampling these. Like so salty it was like someone accidentally dumped the salt in the batter. So, on any other night, they're probably better. 

Brisket was good, nothing outstanding. Overall we enjoyed the bbq sauce, from what we could tell, it was the same sauce served with all the items we ate. Corn bread was terrific, mac 'n cheese was ok.

The service was spotty yet very friendly. There's an upstairs, and servers have to make their way up for the bar and down for the food. So they work very hard. But, there aren't enough of them, and there's only one bartender. He's very nice, but can't possibly keep up. We probably drank about half what we would have had the service been faster and more attentive. 

So overall, I'll be seeking other bbq joints in Toronto before revisiting Smoque."}
{"text":"First time here with some friends on a Sunday night. The food was incredible - some of the best BBQ I've had. Must try: Pulled pork sandwich and Brussels sprouts.  The only complaint is that the service was quite slow. Waitresses seems mismanaged and overwhelmed by the take out orders that they neglected those dining in restaurant."}
{"text":"Dim lighting, smoky smells, quick service, decent prices and most of all, delicious BBQ. We had the beef brisket and pork side ribs with a side of sweet potato waffle fries and brussel sprouts. Meat was juicy and tender and well seasoned. Sides were fresh. Side portions are on the small side. Was a fun date night!"}
{"text":"Hidden little gem right on Queen Street West, across from Trinty Bellwood! Amazing food that tastes fresh from the south. Typically not a fan of BBQ sauce, but whatever they have is amazing! Wide selection of beer to choose from also. Service was great fun, down to earth and genuine!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the service and food especially. 

I came here cause I heard really good things about the food and did some yelp too. 

Upon entering the restaurant we were seated underneath the stairs in the hall way where it was inconvenient as every time someone needed to get through my bf had to move while he was eating. They claimed the normal tables in the front were all reserved.... and yet 1-2 hours later nobody sat in them at all. Completely empty. 

Upon finally deciding what to order, we couldn't find a waitress or waiter in sight. And when we did it was when their whole staff got together in the front room to drink a glass of tequila, while they ignored us waiving them down to order. It was very unprofessional to drink on the job ! Especially at the cost of ignoring your guests. 

When we did have contact with the wait staff finally the 1 girl wearing a sports cap was dismissive and not responsive when we asked for condiments etc. They forgot 2 of the items we ordered, and never bothered to check with us that we received them anyways. And when the food arrived they dumped it on our tables in a disastrous mess, and stared at us to move all the stuff they previously put down all over the place so they wouldn't have to touch our plates. Not sure why you are even a waitress if you don't want to do your job in at least presenting our food properly. 

Anyway onto the food. 

We ordered the baby back ribs full rack. Were told they're fatty but upon receiving them unfortunately the meat was very tough, burned to a crisp and not very flavourful. 

The beet salad, sweet potato waffle fries and onion rings sadly were the only good thing about our visit and to be honest you gotta be a bad chef to mess those things up. So unfortunately the BBQ was not the highlight and never will be in my eyes. The brisket was cold and tough too my bf had stated during the meal. 

2 hours after leaving I had food poisoning from their food. 

Hopefully if you decide to venture into here, that your service and food will be a lot better than ours."}
{"text":"A warm and bright bbq jam near the park for a fun group date with friends. Best to go in a group of more than 4 so that you can try a bit of everything. 

Okay bbq (there's better in this city), good sides and a couple standout items. 

Nice atmosphere and service.

Highlights: 

These two items surprisingly stood out from the rest:

-Smoque Caesar (perfect and a yummy bacon garnish)

-Onion Rings (I was skeptical when the server was raving about them but they truly rock)"}
{"text":"Went back tonight after speaking to the owner about our prior experiences, much better experience! Alex took it upon himself to coordinate and serve us directly which is pretty humble -  a rare occurrence in this town! 

Pulled pork - amazing. Exactly what you would want from the dish. 
Ribs - very blackened. Not to my taste but my dining partner liked them. 
Brisket - I didn't eat them while hot so by the time I got to them, they were rubbery. My dining partner liked them. 
Mac and cheese - sooooo good. Must have! 
Caramelized brussels sprouts - I hate Brussels sprouts so I didn't love these but I didn't hate them either. Good twist on a veg. 
Sweet potato waffle fries - served up work chipotle mayo, delish and a huge portion for a side! 
Cole slaw - apple cider vinaigrette with dill. 
Butter dipped onion rings - ERMERGEEEERD 
Maple bacon smoked bourbon drink thing - my partner ordered this. Came with a bacon and orange garnish. 

Also, holy crap he loaded our drinks!  

The owner is incredibly personable and friendly! He definitely made the experience. 

ALSO - this was all the sampler plate. DO IT. So much food and it came out QUICK."}
{"text":"I ADORE Smoque N'Bones, this is my favourite BBQ restaurant in Toronto. A life without their buttermilk onion rings isn't a life worth living. Their ribs, pulled pork, shoe string fries and mac and cheese are consistently good. The only 2 dishes I have been dissappointed with are the collard greens, which were way too sweet, and the cobb salad b/c they permanently replaced delicious, chunky blue cheese with measly goat cheese pellets."}
{"text":"We ordered the BBQ platter for 2. This is a good way to try a bit of the different meats and sides if you haven't been here before. The meats we chose were the brisket, pulled pork, and the ribs. For sides we chose the potato salad, coleslaw, and macaroni. The coleslaw was good as it crunchy and not overdressed. The sides were decent, but none of them really stood out for me that I would really want to go back and order it again.

My favourite were ribs. They had a lot of flavour, were soft, and I liked the smoky taste. The BBQ sauce that comes with the dishes is pretty good too. The pulled pork was my least favourite it didn't have as much flavour as the 2 other meats. The brisket was tender and soft. We ordered the lemonade cocktail, which is a lighter drink where the alcohol taste doesn't over power the drink. I found the cocktail prices on the higher side.

The decor is modern rustic, with a lot of wood elements. The open kitchen is located right behind the bar area. Everyone here was pretty friendly from the server to the chefs. Since we sat at the bar we got to see the kitchen in action. 

I would be back for the ribs and maybe the pecan tarts, which looked really good. 

Tip: Bring cash as they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"Tried this place out at a Yelp function, and what a find! First of all, let me say that I love BBQ, and in particular, good BBQ. And this place serves the real deal.
Let's get right to the food, 'cause that's what matters most. The ribs are awesome - perfectly seasoned and smoked big St. Louis cut slabs of pork heaven, but the kicker is that they don't sauce them up in the back, they give you sauces and a brush so you can slather on as much or little of their super tasty sauces as you want - brilliant idea! The pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches showcase the quality of the meat and skill of the cooks - the meat is massively flavourful, tender, and with the right amount of sauce that enhances not hides the flavor of the meat, topped with some creamy coleslaw in a lovely soft bun. Yum! Be careful not to fill up on the shoestring fries, sweet potato waffle fries, housemade chips, or buttermilk onion rings because they are so good you could just eat these and be happy.
If you are looking for an alternative to beer, the spiked hickory smoqued lemonade is a perfect accompaniment to wash it all down with.
The place isn't very big, so you might not get a choice, but if you can, try to sit at the bar so you can watch the action - everyone loves dinner and a show! The friendly staff will help you out with any questions, and keep a good eye on the requisite pile of napkins and wet wipes.
I also like that the place doesn't gouge a massive hole in your wallet. It's not dirt cheap, but it is so worth it!
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have finally been able to pay Smoque n' Bones a visit. It's been on my to-go list for over a year now. To celebrate our anniversary, my bf and I were looking for a very relaxed restaurant to eat some good food - we're very laid back and weren't looking for anything super fancy. I was using my trusty yelp app and stumbled upon Smoque n' Bones. 

To start, we walked in and it was nicely decorated. No one greeted us; in fact, the only server (?) there had her back facing the door. I've worked in the restaurant industry before and that's a huge no-no. We walked up to her, and we greeted her. She was not very warm or welcoming. She was very standoffish and was unsure whether the kitchen was still open or not or if they were serving their late night menu. The chef confirmed that the kitchen was still open. We picked our own table, and she brought us menus and tiny glasses with a glass bottle of water. Ps. the water, for some reason, was grainy.. or could have been a dirty glass... *gag* The server's mood did change once she came to grab our orders though...

We ordered the dinner for two and it was enough to fill the two of us. We got the 1/2 rack, 1/4 sausage, 1/4 pulled pork, mac and cheese, baked beans and onion rings.

1/2 rack - The server recommended the rack and it was probably the worst item that came. It was really, really, dry. We did end up packing it to go, and i reheated it in the microwave the next day and it was a lot less dry and more tasty... So I can only assume that we were served ribs that were sitting out way too long.

Sausage - Good but salty

Pulled Pork - The best meat item we got! SOOOO good.

Mac and Cheese - The first item I ate and it was freaking delicious. I still dream about it!

Baked Beans - Mediocre

Onion Rings - Really yummy but salty especially towards the bottom of the bowl.

All in all, I would return and have even planned to return with my friend to get the Mac and Cheese and pulled pork. But I won't recommend the rack unless they're fresh out the oven... and they need to be less heavy handed with the salt..."}
{"text":"I honestly did not know that I could fall in love with barbeque meat!
This place has forever changed my life. (hehe sorry for being dramatic)

As soon as you get to the front of the restaurant, the distinctive midwest/southern-smokey flavour will drive all the little guys in your olfactory system wild! A good ol' glass of scotch will perfectly complement this place. 

For three girls, we shared the Sampler for Two which was actually more than enough for us. It comes with a choice of 3 meats and 3 sides. 

This was what we got: 
Meats: 
-Pork ribs - this is by far our favorite one. 
-Half a chicken -this was good too!
-Beef brisket - meh, I was expecting the brisket to be more like pulled pork and less like slices of meat

Sides: 
-Cornbread - ahh so good! It was slightly crispy on the outside and soft and sweet as you bite into it. It came with a really flavorful butter too!
-Buttermilk Onion rings 
-Brussels sprouts - Tasty! And made us feel less guilty about having all the meat..

I honestly can't wait to go back to try the pulled pork and the other sides!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've been to in a while. The smoked meats were all juicy and cooked to perfection. Southern-style sides like mac n' cheese and potato salad were much better than expected based on similar restaurants crashing and burning in the sides area. The atmosphere is very chill and trendy - a great first date spot. There are only a few tables but the bar is where it's at anyway. You get a front-seat view of all the action and get to take in all the smells of the meats cooking on the grill. Prices are super reasonable.  The owner seems extremely passionate about his business, he needs to take it a little easier on his staff.  While his perfectionism is evident, this place would be a 5 for me if he had as much care for his staff as he clearly does for the customers."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and downtown so not too far to travel for me. I am usually a brisket fan but the pulled pork took the stage here. The beef rib was very good as well but the amount of meat on each rib varied, and the rib that I got didn't have much (I shared with a friend) but my friend's had a good amount. The sampler for two, as others have already commented, is not an awesome savings so just order by the dish.

The one thing that brought the experience a little lower was that the food didn't come out smoothly. Mind you, we were a large group so I have to give some leniency, but they brought out a wave of the meat and we were almost done the meat before we got our sides. Also, the water comes in old whiskey bottles, very cool, but the glasses are like whiskey glasses so they were petite, I think it held maybe 50ml so we were constant refilling them with water after 2 gulps. 

The second floor was great for our party, I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"What can you really say the bbq ribs are amazing, the sausage is awesome and the brisket and pulled pork is wicked good. If you do go with a friend I would recommend getting the sampler for 2. 

It also comes with 3 sides of your choice
3 Main meats of your choice
 
Enough food for 2 people :)

If you go with a group they do have seating upstairs and if they're backed up in the kitchen they get your order out asap. All around great experience!"}
{"text":"This BBQ place is truly wonderful if you are looking for some great tasting smoked um ..  everything!  The food is very flavorful with plenty of Love added to the ingredients.  You can tell that the chefs try to make every dish like it will be your favorite.  I went here for a birthday party and our group had 12 people. We had reservations and our server Alexa was extremely attentive and catered to our every need.  We ordered a ton of dishes for our table and basically almost tried everything on the menu.....or at least it felt like it because our bill was close to $400...but I guess thats what happens when you add 1.5 ounce shots to the bill multiplied by 9...okay...maybe 12..or was it 16? Things got kinda blurry after a few.... haha!

Anyways back to the food.  We ordered the Sampler for two which came with your choice of 3 meats and 3 sides for $48.50.  We went with the pulled chicken, beef brisket, and pulled pork. Our sides included coleslaw, mac n cheese, and cornbread.  We also ordered bacon wrapped chicken skewers x3, more mac n cheese, ribs, popcorn shrimp, chicken wings, and some more chicken.  ALL OF THE FOOD WAS PHENOMENAL! (insert LL Cool J song here \"sumthin like a Phenomenon!\") My only complaint was that the portions were small compared to the prices and wished that you got more...oh well... just make sure you bring your wallet with unlimited funds so you can enjoy all the awesomeness this place has."}
{"text":"First of all their pulled chicked sandwich just melts in your mouth and its amazing. Their ribs are great if youre craving ribs. Every couple of weeks i drive half an hour for a pulled chicken sandwich. I call in to order since this place is PACKED and there is no where to sit. Yesterday i was starving and on my way to get the chicken sandwich some crazy road rage driver almost made me crash. Moral of the story chicken is to die for !"}
{"text":"Even though the drinks and food were great, overall 3 stars and would hesitate coming back/spending money here as the service was very poor. A woman who was acting so much like I'M THE MANAGER that I'm assuming she was indeed the manager was very annoying and know-it-all-ish, and was visibly annoyed that my friend and I sat at the bar close to the place where they pick up dishes from the kitchen. But ummm we were seated there so why the attitude? Other than that, we waited way too long to be asked if we wanted another drink (for all three rounds), no one asked if we had everything we ordered, just overall the servers were not attentive or on top of things. For such a small place, what gives? I think your servers need better training. It really kills the vibe, regardless of how good the actual BBQ was (props to the cook, who was badass and definitely the most 'on top of things' person in the whole place).

Another strange observation is that they had one playlist of about 8 songs on repeat for the two hours that I was there - lol. Who wants to hear the same songs over and over and over again? Seems like poor management/attention to detail overall."}
{"text":"If I haven't already tried Adamson BBQ, this would probably be a 5 star review. We came here with friends who have raved about how good Smoque N Bones was, and it didn't disappoint. We tried a little of everything, and every dish was excellent. The only thing lacking would be that the chicken and some meats were a little on the dry side. When eating this type of food, I prefer it to be dripping with fats, but maybe that's personal preference. Still an excellent choice for BBQ eats,"}
{"text":"The only bad part about my experience was that I ordered 1/4lb of the beef brisket when I should have ordered 1/2lb!!!!! I just finished my entree and I'm still in the restaurant, writing this review! Customer service was great too. Head chef kept checking on us and asked how we liked our meal! 

I highly recommend the following: the beef brisket, the peppercorn beef, corn bread (comes with sweet butter!!!! Mmmm!!), and the buttermilk onion rings (hand made! per the head chef). And omg the pecan pie!!!!! 

Soooo good! Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Smoque & Bones Yelp Elite Event October 27, 2014
I hoped off the Queen streetcar and looked across the street from Trinity Bellwoods park at the new Smoque & Bones restaurant. I was greeted by the Yelp party organizer, Evelyn, who gave me a red and yellow bandito handkerchief as a keepsake for the cowboy themed pre-Halloween party. It's a smaller venue with high tables and affixed stools along the bar. 
I feel like I'm in Alabama. Jeff Healy, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Muddy Waters wafting through the meaty smoke air makes me think of a hot summer night in the middle October.
I moseyed up to the end of the bar and was greeted by Smoque & Bones publicists. They were lovely tasting companions. We started out with the mouth-watering hand dipped buttermilk onion rings served w homemade aioli sauce. I was hungry and I couldn't get enough! It's too bad they took up so much stomach real estate because the meat-a-palooza that was about to follow.
Delicious juicy pulled pork and chicken sandwiches both topped with creamy coleslaw on toasted garlic butter bun with house BBQ sauce ($9.90). I have noticed that pulled pork is in fashion right now, kind of like Old Fashioned cocktails, and I have to say I am loving the homage to bourbon. 
Smoked rib ends will be on the dinner menu shortly. Mixture of BBQ sauce & hot sauce. Intense sweet heat juxtaposed w crispy deep fried rib ends.
The show stopper has got to be the pork ribs though (half rack $17.90). These meat-morsels are pre-smoked in their smoker oven during the day then vacuum sealed to hold in the freshness and keep the meat juicy. They are then thrown on the grill to cook and then served with generous helpings of BBQ sauce to be applied with a painter brush. I painted myself a rib-Reuben masterpiece with heaping dollops of their delicious sauce.
Everything washed down like Louisiana rain with the smoky spiked hickory-smoqued lemonade made of lemonade, mint and bourbon ($9.50).
Very friendly server staff, Nathalie, has worked her for five months and attests she's still not bored of the menu.
The owner, Alex, has a background in venture capital took a hiatus after 9/11 attacks. I asked him why this place. He said that he has always wanted to own a restaurant. I had a great conversation with Lexa (Alex's girlfriend and co-owner). She attests to Alex's natural ability to remember patron's names and his fascination with making meals to impress and enchant his guests at home. Tries hard to impress his guests. Possibly Mediterranean heritage Italian? Stressing family togetherness and sharing.
Specials:
Monday's $5 beer pint. ($2.50 half pint)
The high stools and wall of bourbon may preclude a parent from bringing their young.
Come on mom! Have a shot of bourbon with me!
Smoque & Bones is worth every second of meat-sweat you will perspire.

{"text":"everything was good, but not great. Love the atmosphere. The server didn't know the difference between back and side ribs. Great spot to have a drink. BBQ was good, not great. Sides were much better than most bbq places I go to. One of the better BBQ places in Toronto, but if you have had really good BBQ outside of Toronto, this is not up to those standards"}
{"text":"I was at Smoque N' Bones last week for a small get together which was supposed to be larger but it didn't work out that way.  Because of the size of our party we had the upstairs booked but because so many didn't show we were asked to go to the main dining area on the main floor which was understandable.

The bar albeit small and tight is really attractive in a sense that really gives a \"wooden crate\" feel to it.  It's just ahead of part of the prep area kind of how part of the grill area is in the main front of the restaurant and the path to the restrooms in the basement splits that work area and the bar area.  It feels strange as it feels as if you're walking into the work area on the way to the basement if you need to go there.

Still the seating around the front are stools and high tops as opposed to tables upstairs where it's air conditioned upstairs as well.  On a steamy day we sat near the front of the main floor instead by the open garage door window type opening.

The bar here has a good selection of beer and whiskey.  The bar has seating for about 6 or so (at the bar) with additional seating at the grill half with another 6 or so.

My wife and I as well as the other couples there all went with the samplers which is your choice of 3 meats and 3 sides for under 60 dollars.  The food was well enough for a couple to share.  We ended up going with ribs, brisket and chicken.  The quantities are mentioned specifically on the menu such as 1/4 lb of brisket, half (of a whole) chicken, and I believe it was 1/2 rack of (side) ribs.  For sides we went with onion rings, collard greens, mac and cheese with an additional side of potato chips.

The table we had was pretty sufficient for surface area for the amount of food all 3 couples ordered with sides, drinks, etc.  The food basically all came out at once for everybody and we were all digging right in.

The brisket was good but it didn't seem like there was really a lot.  One quarter pound equates to about 4 slices?  (1 oz a slice perhaps?)  The ribs while good and well cooked seemed to be a bit \"skinny\" for already cut side ribs but the bones where of decent length.  The chicken was well done as well, not burnt but cooked well.  The extremities like wings and such were blackened but the meat was moist and cooked through and through but remained juicy, even the white meat portions.

The sides were good as well.  The onion rings were lightly battered kind of how Wahlburgers does theirs but a touch heavier on the batter.  The chips were ok, I had wished I had ordered fries instead though.  The mac and cheese was great, they used the scoobi-doo type twisty macaroni which I love and the collard greens were a good change as well.

Overall the food at Smoque N' Bones is good and the service is also good but I had just wished the portions were a little more \"American\".  The sampler is a good value for 2 and mind you we didn't finish it all so it was satisfying enough.  The quality of everything overall is IMO above average and it's obvious that SNB is not your average type of place.  

When speaking of BBQ it's hard to not compare it to other establishments in and around the city.  Barque for instance is well known as well.  They are sort of the same echelon with different types of servings for groups and such.

The bottom line is we did have an enjoyable evening at Smoque N' Bones and it's a good, well established restaurant in the Trinity Bellwoods area that helps contribute to raising the bar of the area."}
{"text":"Arrived as a party of three on a Friday afternoon, I had the pulled pork with a side of cornbread, the other two both had brisket with various sides. First time visitors.

Food: My pork was reheated garbage, plain and simple. I'm not sure when it was originally smoked, and I can't speak for their food at it's freshest, but it was not served hot (was room temp when it arrived), and too much water was used in steaming it resulting in a watered down flavour. Maybe 20% of my serving was fat. The brisket was also clearly reheated from refrigeration; it was thinly sliced, had a shiny/silver tinge, was not hot when it reached our table, and was lacking in flavour. It's of note that our meat came with no sides or veggies/slaw.The cornbread was good, almost good enough to bump this review to two stars. Given the above average reviews, I was thoroughly disappointed. 

Service: Our group arrived right after another group, but the place was empty prior. Our order was taken relatively quickly, but it was about 30 minutes before we got our food. I'm normally not too picky about this, but our glasses were filthy, mine was covered in lipstick stains. The place filled up to maybe 60% capacity by the time we were done eating, and as a result it was close to 40 minutes later when we got our bill. 

Overall, I was on the fence about sending my food back, however the cornbread was good enough to prevent me. Given the above average price point (especially for lunch) compared to the several other bbq joints that have been opening up shop around the city (Barque, Electric Mud, Hogtown smoke), I can't recommend this place in the slightest. 

I'm aware that reviews for this place are generally positive, however this review is based on solely my experience. It's quite possible that they suffer from consistency issues, or the kitchen was trying to get rid of some older meat - but that doesn't give them a pass from me."}
{"text":"Portions of food were very chinsy. We got the Mac n cheese, cornbread, brisket, and pulled pork ($36 between the two of us before tax and delivery fees). The food was good but definitely not worth the amount we spent for the portions we got. Barely enough food to feed the two of us.  

Would not go back."}
{"text":"Just checked this place out this past weekend - it is great! we sat upstairs since was packed on main level - great ambience and the music was dope - 80's rock pop stuff all night!
we got some old fashions and single malts - they have one of the best selections for scotch I have seen in a while - the bartender dude was awesome - he helped us pick some fancy scotches and even gave us a taste sample!
I got the 1/2 rack pork ribs - great BBQ flavours, deftly recommend - good portion sizes
the mac and cheese wasn't all that though - small portion and very bland - but everything else was spot on!
would deflty go back."}
{"text":"Came here last Saturday for a birthday gathering with a bunch of friends. There was about 10 of us so we were split among two high tables. We made reservations in advance just in case as the restuarant was fairly busy.

We decided to order the sampler for 2 and a bunch of side dishes thinking that the sampler would give us a lot of food but it turns out the portions werent that big..so instead we found ourselves ordering more food! The sampler came with corn bread, smoked chicken, beef brisket, ribs, pulled chicken, sweet potato fries and coleslaw. All were very tasty but just very small portions! We also ordered mac and cheese and a few other dishes on the side. The mac and cheese had to be my favourite
...It had a light creamy texture that melted in your mouth!

The service was great and very attentive. She came back and asked us if we wanted to order more food because the food kept clearing up pretty fast! Lol. Guess we underestimated the portions.

Overall, everything was great except the portions so I doubt I'd come back considering the price you have to pay in order to be full."}
{"text":"5 stars alone for the smell of this place. Smoked meat is delicious. Any place you go in town the smoked meat will be delicious.  This place is not an exception. Its about the sides and everything else. Chicken mac n cheese. three thumbs up. Fries very good. service is pretty quick and its a fun little spot to have dinner, was packed on a Tuesday (On a Tuesday! #Ilovemakinon) when I went but we weren't left waiting.I expect its wouldn't be as pleasant if you went on  a Friday or Saturday night.  Friendly staff without the attitude for the fifth star in this review."}
{"text":"We came for the sampler. The pulled pork was tasty. The sweet potato fries were not bad. The ribs I find them okay as they don't fall off the bone. 

What stood out in my mind were the corns. It's so tasty. 

The corn was fresh and sweet with grilled cheddar. All the flavours were a good marriage. Basically when you eat that you don't want anyone to talk to you to distract you."}
{"text":"After coming here a lot, I realized the best way to determine which meat you like best is to come chow down with a group of extremely hungry buddies. My first experience here, I came with 4 others (all of us starving) and we got three \"sampler for two's\" to share between us cuz we wanted to try all the meats as well as some of the interesting sides.

The pork side ribs were amazing (the most mind-blowing meat here hands down) and probably their namesake/signature item. Great smoke ring and had a bite. Once you bit into them, that's when the meat fell off the bone. The bbq sauce that came with them was drinkable and you couldn't get enough of it. Excellent stuff.

The beef brisket was above average.  Again, awesome smoke ring, however, one of the servings of brisket we got was slightly dry (probably had been sitting in the window for a couple min). The fresh portions were fatty and tender. The red cabbage that came with it was unique and cleansed the palette well. I have definitely had better brisket but they do it pretty well here.

The bbq chicken was so juicy and the skin was so flavorful. A burst of flavor hits your tongue biting into the skin. Great sauce to accompany the meat and probably the second best meat after the ribs.

The pulled pork was so feathery and moist it disintegrated in your mouth. Not much chewing needed. Excellent sauce that came with it.

Both the sausage and peppercorn beef were tasty as well but if I were to rank the meat in order I'd say 1) ribs 2) chicken 3) pulled pork 4) brisket 5) sausage 6) peppercorn beef.

Now on to the sides. We decided collectively to skip the cornbread,baked beans and house made chips as they didn't seem as exciting as the other sides.

The potato salad and coleslaw were very tasty and had a slight vinegary tang to it. Much more interesting flavor profile compared to generic coleslaws and potato salads. Probably my fave sides of the bunch. The onion rings just weren't very good. They were overfried and I honestly can't say they tasted differently than regular onion rings. The candied yams were ok (better than the sweet potato fries). Sweet potato waffle fries were not bad but again tasted generic. Mac n' cheese presentation was cool with the bread crumb topping. However, one of the portions was slightly bland (kinda disappointing as I absolutely love mac n' cheese). The shoestring fries were probably the better tasting fries of the two.

Ranking the sides in order I'd go 1) slaw 2) potato salad 3) mac n' cheese 4) shoestring fries 5) candied yams 6) sweet potato fries 7) buttermilk onion rings. I actually wanted to try the pickled veggie jar and collard greens (seeing as we had duplicate orders for some of the sides) but no one else at the table wanted either of them so they were looked over.

Might've ordered dessert if we had room but we were all thoroughly destroyed afterwards (all of us had food babies and surprisingly we managed to finish all the food). The bread pudding sounded yummy though. Maybe I'll try it next time.

TL;DR - ribs, chicken and pulled pork are must-gets, coleslaw and potato salad best sides.

Conclusion: This is a great bbq place in the heart of the downtown core. Can't go wrong with beer and proper bbq!"}
{"text":"I was feeling somewhat indulgent after 4 months of being on a mostly vegetarian diet. I decided that if I was going to cheat i am going all out since I had been craving BBQ ribs for quite some time. This brought me to Smoque N Bones one pleasant Saturday afternoon.

Jars of pickled veggies surround above the typically wood-n-metal counter in the middle of the room which surrounds the smoker and open kitchen. Billows of smoke pour out into the giant exhaust hood leaving very little trace of lingering smoke (a bonus if you don't like walking out of restaurants smelling of BBQ meat, especially with the many cute canines out for a walk in the Trinity Bellwoods area)

I ordered a pint of beer, sweet potato waffle fries, collard greens (for balance, and heck just because i like collard greens) and a quarter rack of ribs. Service was attentive and cheerful. Sitting at the bar/counter affords you the show of watching the chefs put everything together and I am met with a friendly nod of acknowledgement. 

Ribs arrive on a papered metal tray with some extra bbq sauce and a paint brush. On first glance, ribs appear a bit more charred than is my usual preference however once i bit into them i knew I was wrong in prejudging them. The ribs were perfectly done with the right amount of bite off the bone and had no trace of the bitterness of burnt meat that I thought might happen. The full smokey flavour permeates and gets all into your fingers as much as your face is smeared with sauce. Exactly the way BBQ should be. Great stuff!! 

Smoque n Bones earns two very messy and enthusiastic thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"I'm a born and raised Kansas Citian and currently live in Virginia, so I'd say I'm pretty well versed in damn good BBQ. I was in town for the night so we decided to walk around the corner and grab some BBQ from this local joint. 

Drinks: The smoky old fashioned, negroni cocktail and Bob Dylan were fantastic. My final cocktail was the spiked lemonade and it was really sweet. Overall, we started off very impressed. 

Food: fried chicken sandwich and the macaroni and cheese were awesome. Get the fried chicken sandwich. Pulled pork was served with a sweet, rich KC style BBQ sauce, not the more traditional tangy sauce, which was a surprise. Collards had great flavor but should've been cooked longer. They weren't very palatable. Chips were stale. 

Service: Initially reeeeally slow, but after they weren't as busy they became very attentive and even chill and we had some good conversations with them. Overall really cool staff of people. 

Owner: Oh my goodness, the owner/chef was really loud. Like yelling over the music loud. He came over to our table and asked how the food was. I told him I was overall very impressed. He pushed us asking for more feedback so I told him the collards were tough. He defended his choice to undercook them because he \"doesn't like mush\" and doesn't sell any when they're mushy, like I like them. Whatever. Don't ask for feedback if you can't take the feedback. 

Overall, a pretty alright place if you're not in a hurry."}
{"text":"The waiter is very nice guy. The food is awesome! They have the good root beer too. Dont forget to try it out. We are 2 guys and ordered full rack pork rip. We cant finish it. Very tasty"}
{"text":"The onion rings and sweet potato waffle fries were great, though 7$ is a bit steep for the portion. Potato salad was very bland.  The potatoes cone in very large chunks but they didn't seem to be seasoned at all written being cooked. The barbeque itself wasn't too great. Half the ribs were very dry, flavour was good but it really didn't have much moisture left. The brisket comes in fairly thin slices, the texture was fine though a bit weak on smoke and flavour, the bbq sauce is decent. Perhaps I'm just a fan of the slightly thicker juicier slabs. Overall I've had better. Good place to stop at for a drink and a snack but definetly not the place to satisfy my bbq craving."}
{"text":"Delicious, tender ribs.. some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Incredible BBQ! Their sides are great too. Hard to beat this BBQ place. Definitely a hidden gem! I'll be back."}
{"text":"You can't miss this place if you are a barbecue fan.

It was a lucky pick to come here before bar hopping. They have the kind of food that cushions hard boost.

The decoration is based on wood with rustic-dark ambience. The premises count with 2 floors and a bar in each level: fast cheers!

The smell of other tables conjugated with our hunger, made us order the rib tips appetizer and the meal for 2...Too much meat!!!

The pulled pork, the ribs, and the baked beans were my favourite items. The pulled pork came with a brush and a sauce that provided moist (detail that also added points to the dish); it was succulent, tender, and juicy. The beans had a sweet touch: some of the most flavourful I've ever tasted. 

The beef brisket was meh... 

Careful with the rib tips if you can't handle  spicy food. Their sauce was hot and messy.

Although I was extremely satisfied, I couldn't conceive to leave a couple of ribs behind. I knew I would regret it when the boost munchies kick in: better full than sorry."}
{"text":"3.5

I'm a fan of the food but this place is rather poorly managed, which is unfortunate. 

Had dinner here on a Friday evening around 7 pm. It's an open kitchen so if you sit at the bar like we did, you'll be able to see all the chefs preparing the food and communicating with each other as they work through each order. You'll witness both positive and negative exchanges between the chefs. On one side, it's cool that they don't feel the need to put on a fake show for patrons but on another hand, it can make you a little uncomfortable when you see the main chef reprimanding a waiter or chef over some hiccups.

However, a major perk to sitting at the bar is being able to get some samples (i.e.: brussel sprouts, ribs) randomly handed to you by the main chef. They're unexpected and a nice touch as you wait for your food.

For 2, we ordered the sampler which comes with 3 meats and 3 sides ($48.50). We chose chicken, beef brisket and ribs for our meat and sweet potato waffles fries, mac & cheese, buttermilk onion rings for our sides. Then because of FOMO, we got an additional 1/4lb of pulled pork and sausages to REALLY try everything. 

Meat highlights are none other than the ribs & pulled pork. Their smokey BBQ sauce is fantastic, perfectly complementing the meat. Although to be a little critical, certain parts of the ribs were way too smokey/burnt which made it a bit bitter and consequently, less enjoyable.  The 1/2 chicken probably has the highest value as the portion is quite substantial. It comes with a good chunk of white meat. However, there was nothing amazing about it.  Tastes like your regular smoke-roasted chicken. The same could be said for the beef brisket and the sausages. Nothing special. 

What stole the show were the sides! Possibly the best onion rings out there and their mac & cheese is like no other. Each bite had me asking \"how is this so good?!\" to my boyfriend. Absolutely delicious and a must-try. The mac & cheese is so creamy but not heavy at all. Ugh. I also loved the sweet potato waffle fries which was super tasty and a generous portion. You can't go wrong with any of these! (Also, I had a sample of the brussel sprouts while waiting for our food and I wasn't the biggest fan. I would recommend getting the other sides.) 

So in what aspect does this place fall short? Service. Our waiter pretty much disappeared during our meal and only came back at the very end. We couldn't ask for anything we wanted because nobody was around. He was there for one part of the meal though - when we had to ask if our beef brisket was coming out (we waited an extra 20 minutes after everything was served to see if it would). The kitchen had forgotten about our order despite a plate was sitting right in front already prepped with the braised red cabbage packed onto it for the longest time. I was watching it pretty hard lol. We had asked to cancel the beef brisket since we were getting pretty full but the waiter made some excuse saying it would be hard to calculate the final bill if we removed it. Huh?? They could've just added the 1/4lb of pulled pork into the platter and counted that as the third meat since it was the same amount served in the sampler anyways. I don't recall an apology and the lack of attempt to accommodate us put me off.

Another quibble I had was the amount of time we waited for our food. Sitting at the bar, we were able to hear every order being called out and worked on. 80% of them were all for delivery/take-out and there was a LOT of them. I tried to be really patient but as time passed, I couldn't help but wonder when they'd actually start working on the food for people who were literally sitting right in front of them or even in the actual restaurant. I mean I'm sure it's prioritized on a first come first serve basis which is fair but by focusing too much on these external orders, they're compromising the experience of the dine-in customers. 

Perhaps it's best to not sit at the bar because you see and notice way too much. I'd recommend sitting at a table. 

P.S.: The bar had such dim lighting I couldn't take too many good photos and I didn't want to be the person with the flash on."}
{"text":"We went here on a Black Friday for lunch. When we walked in, there were a table of 5 people already there. We placed our order, got our water drinks, and proceeded to sit and wait. After a long time, the 5 people next to us got their food. Then we waited some more. In fact, we waited for more than 40 minutes before we finally got our food. When asked why it took so long, the waitress said that it takes a long time for the BBQ. OK. Since I know a little bit about cooking and BBQ-ing, the BBQ meats were started a long time before the place opened and not after we placed the order. All they had to do was get the meat onto the plates and serve it. The kitchen staff was just slow and inefficient. You can watch them get orders ready and see how slow they were in getting the orders out. This was not just us, the couple who came after we did also complained about their long wait. The food was delicious (hence the 2 stars), but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Love it! Their fried chicken and corn bread are so delicious! It's my go to place when I have friends from out of town. I absolutely recommend it!"}
{"text":"It's aight.  Onion rings (huge portion) and corn were great sides.  The ribs just didn't stand out unfortunately.  Flavor was decent, and correct ratio of sauciness.. but just too dry and slightly tough.. likely a result of the fat content not being up to par on the meat itself.  They most certainly don't fall off the bone.  Frankly, the ribs I had at Montana's a couple months ago were more tender and unctuous.. so that says something lol. Server upstairs behind the bar was wonderfully warm and chatty though."}
{"text":"The loud atmosphere makes it hard to carry on a conversation without yelling. 

Service was slow despite the restaurant not being overly busy for a Saturday night dinner service.
Our waitress forgot to put in 2 of the items from our order and it took very long for them to arrive to the table once we enquired about their whereabouts. 

Despite them advertising themselves as a bourbon bar, when we asked to see a bourbon menu we were told that they \"didn't really have one\", but they had \"pretty much everything\"...

My party sampled the brisket, pulled pork, rib tips, sausage, and a number of sides. 
Food was decent, but not the best bbq in the city that I've had. 

The cocktails though are FANTASTIC and very much worth the price. 

Bread pudding w/caramel bourbon sauce for desert was the best I've ever tasted.

Overall an average experience, but I am open to making a return visit to try them out again."}
{"text":"I think I came here back in May or June? I came in with a friend and we were seated pretty promptly. Unfortunately, I didn't get any pictures of our experience, but the food was delightful here. Especially the side of corn :) We ordered the sampler because you get to try a bit of everything, but it was customised in the sense that you got to pick which things you wanted to eat (out of the meat options given and any three sides) for a set price.  .

I noticed a lot of reviews commented on the service of this place, but we had a pleasant experience. There was a small hiccup because they forgot our third side, but they gave it to us right away when we asked. I think our server was a new girl? (at the time), she was blonde and very cute and polite. 

The downside to this place is that it's rather a small space and we were sitting at a table under the stairs. I was constantly getting bumped into by people trying to get by the small space. The table was a little small for the amount of food that comes out too, but we didn't mind too much. It was just a tad awkward to eat with barely any table space. 

The food was good! We ordered the options of ribs, chicken and brisket. Sides were chips, corn and mashed potatoes ? I honestly cannot remember the last side we ordered was, sorry :( The food was cooked well, not charred to the point of being burnt, they gave you extra sauce if you needed it (I didn't), juicy and tender meats and really good corn (there was a little spice on them, which I really liked). 

It's pretty standard in price, not too too expensive, but definitely not cheap eats. If you're going to go, I think the sampler is the best option because you get to try a bit of everything. We had food left over, so I think you get a decent amount of food too. I'd visit again :)"}
{"text":"I walked by a few times and this place was always full, so for NYE I felt like going to a relaxed place with good authentic BB&Q and that' s exactly what we got here tonight! We got the sharing BBQ for two- lovely! My buddy liked the ribs especially, the brisket is great too!
The owner told us he is selecting local good quality meat and we definitely tasted that resulting great flavour during our beautiful meal. 
Don't hesitate, meat lovers... The coleslaw is great too by the way!"}

Great selection of excellent local brews. The cornbread is to die for. The music is a very appropriate accompaniment."}

{"text":"Had the brisket sandwich. The meat was tough and not tasty at all. 
It also made me nauseous and sick to my stomach. 
The cornbread was dry too...I will not be back."}
{"text":"My significant other (SO) and I visited Smoque N' Bones on May 22, 2015. We were going to the Lower Ossington Theatre to see American Idiot musical, and wanted to see a good place nearby and found Smoque N' Bones from Yelp.

I came here before my SO arrived and was waiting for a seat. I was immediately annoyed as I was standing there waiting for a seat and no one bothered to greet me. One waitress had her back turned and was taking phone calls, and even tho staff saw me standing there, no one bothered to talk to me or ask me if I needed any help. Finally when the waitress was off the phone she sat me to a place nearby the door. My SO arrived soon thereafter. 

We shared Sample for Two ($49.80), which came with 3 meat, 3 sides. We chose the following: Pork Side ribs, House Sausage, Smoked Chicken, Cornbread, Sweet Potato Waffle Fries and Butter Milk Onion Rings.

Pork Side Ribs:
We got about 6 pieces of the ribs. The ribs were good. Obviously not as juicy or moist as your typical back ribs, the side ribs did have a nice BBQ flavour and it was not dry. 

House Sausage
Biggest disappointment of the night. This thing was drier than dried prune. The sausage had some nice spice to it, but it was such a dry meat, I did not enjoy this at all. After reading Yelp reviews indicating how good the sausage was, I figured I would give this a chance. After trying the sauage, I wanted to club every single one of the reviewers' tongue. Do not bother with this - you do not get much meat, and for the price you would be paying ($8.90), you are able to get 2 sausages from street vendors of Toronto that you probably enjoy it more. 

Smoked Chicken
Second disappointment. It had similar flavour as the ribs, which I did like. What I did not like was, again, how dry it was. I never knew that I could be eating a dark meat (leg, thigh) that was drier than grilled chicken breast. 


Cornbread
Both my SO and I enjoyed the cornbread. The cornbread comes with honey butter (which honestly felt like it had some apple flavour). The cornbread was really hot, which seemed like it came just off the hot oven. It was crispy, sweet (but not overly sweet) and did not feel too heavy or rich. 

Sweet Potato Waffle Fries
I think my SO enjoyed this more than any other food from here. The fries were different from typical sweet potato ``fries`` I have had in the past. Typically, I find sweet potato fries not crispy enough and because they are usually thicker cuts, they feel more of a dessert (due to sweetness of sweet potato fries being more distinguishable). Here, fries were cut in waffle format (similar to honeycomb). It was thin and lightly salted, which helped to balance sweetness of the sweet potato fries. Definitely would say \"not our typical sweet potato fries\".

Butter Milk Onion Rings
Again, looks like to me this place do better with sides than their meat, which is both unusual and disappointing. The butter milk onion rings were lightly battered with slight crisp to it. It was not drenched in oil like some of the onion rings you would have. Little bit pricier than other sides at $5.90, they do give you plenty of rings. 

I did not like the restaurant atmosphere much - the seats were super uncomfortable as all the seats were high chairs, regardless of whether you are sitting by the counter or a table. They opened up the door and the window to prevent indoor smoker from smoking up the restaurant. However, since we were sitting by the door, we felt chilly from all the cold air coming in.  

I also thought the Sampler for Two could be... well, more of a deal. Priced at $48.90, you might get screwed if you do not pick your choices wisely. If you were to get cheaper combination, you will actually lose out more than you would gain out of the `deal`. The fact that you have to make a conscious decision to make the deal worthwhile irked me.   

Honestly, this place continues my much dislike of many of Queen West restaurants hyped/reviewed well on Yelp. I have been to many restaurants by Queen West, and most of them simply do not live up to the review/expectation set from Yelp. The quality of service, food and overall experience simply do not justify the relatively higher price tag these restaurants charge. 

If I ever happen to go back, I probably would stick with their sides."}
{"text":"Food is overpriced for what you get. Service is horrible. People that work there are rude. And with all the BBQ restaurants in toronto, I will never go there again or order from them. They need a lesson in customer service."}
{"text":"This was stop 2 on our 7 restaurant foodie adventure so when we got here we were still starving. We let our server, a friendly and efficient guy, know that we were on a restaurant hopping afternoon so he made everything quick for us and gave us some good recommendations. 

We got the pulled pork mac n cheese, not too salty or cheesy, but a great amount. Topped by juicy, fatty pulled pork. It went really well all together and we had no problem finishing it. It could have been a little warmer though.

The sweet potato waffle fries came with delicious chipotle mayo to dip. the fires were crispy and hot when we got them and went nicely with the pulled pork.

I think at one point i made a man n cheese and pulled pork waffle fries sandwich lol 

The craft cocktails here are what grabbed my attention though, we had the maple bacon manhattan... i hate bourbon normally, can't stand the smell or taste, but this one changed my mind. I even had a whiskey later that night at a bar. The drink came with a piece of bacon, orange peel and black cherry on a stick. The maple offset the flavors of the bourbon and blended everything together well. Def a must try! 

Next time I'll try the buttermilk onion rings and ribs and corn bread lol YUM"}
{"text":"This place has some solid BBQ but there is better spots in Toronto. Barque Smokehouse is hard to beat and would recommend over this place. The ribs were the best item on the menu followed by their pulled pork. Nothing really makes me want to go back. Food is a 4 star but their service isn't great. I had booked on Open Table for 3 people and had selected a regular table vs the bar and it took some arguing with the server to get an actual table."}
{"text":"Ok, the ribs were tasty and the sides were bland.  The food is not cheap and if you go when it's busy you probably won't find a spot to sit, so you're better off getting take out.  Keep in mind, you may have to wait a bit, but it's worth it.  As I said the sides were bland, so don't waste your money on them, the meat is where it's at!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm one of the rare guests who didn't enjoy a late night bite here. Feels bad man. :c Maybe I just came in at the wrong time. (9pm)

Side ribs were dry, burnt, and smol. Also when the server cut the full rack into half, he gave one less rib to me than the other table for no reason ???

Adamson Barbecue. I'm sorry for cheating on you. :'((("}
{"text":"I have to say. This is basically the best place for ribs. You actually don't need to consider other places as options anymore. Thank you for providing me with those wonderful meat :)"}
{"text":"This place serves the best ribs I've had in Toronto so far. Very tasty, falling off the bones, just spot on! 

Great pulled pork and fries as well, absolutely recommending this place!"}
{"text":"What can I say?! This place rocks!!

Thanks to Chef Alex, Evelyn, and Yelp for organizing an awesome evening here last night. This is my favourite BBQ place in Toronto and a must visit for any meat lover, in my opinion.

My fave items are the light as a feather buttermilk onion rings, creamy tangy coleslaw, juicy smoky pulled pork, and spicy sticky BBQ riblets (shhh it's a new item!). Be sure to try one of their handcrafted cocktails as well, I am partial to their spiked lemonade with mint and bourbon.

Chef Alex is a very awesome dude and his staff is excellent as well. If you are lucky enough to sit in front of his carving station you may even get to try a bonus rib ;) 

Can't wait to bring my mom to check out brunch this weekend!"}
{"text":"Good but nothing to write home about. Had the sampler, for the price I expected better portions. Meats were good (brisket, pulled pork, sausage),  sides were meh."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequently get takeout from here. I always thought my dad's bbq ribs were the best... But now he's got competition! A little taste of home in Toronto!
Very moist,  not greasy, flavourful ribs. They come with extra sauce on the side but they don't even need it since they have so much flavour already. 
The pulled pork and brisket is awesome here too. My favourite side dish has to be the Mac and cheese. Creamy, cheesy comfort food!the potato salad is really nice too!
I haven't eaten in the restaurant itself because I'm such a messy eater and no one wants to see me eat ribs in public- but while waiting for takeout I notice that it has a fun, lively vibe, especially in the summer when the front is open to the street. The staff is also really pleasant and food comes out in good time.
Overall, I would recommended Smoque N bones for great comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. Wish there was a 2/3 meat sampler option for one person so I could try everything without dropping $60 for the 2 person platter.  Had a seat at the bar and it gave me a good view of the action.  Skip the collards--they need to be simmered another hour at least to not taste like rubber--but the sides the couple was eating beside me looked great. Pulled pork was a winner. I'd come back to try the corned beef and fried chicken."}
{"text":"May be heresy but the corn, collard greens and Brussels sprouts rivaled the amazing pulled pork and peppercorn beef."}

I really love southern comfort food and BBQ. So coming in to this restaurant I really hoped it wouldn't leave a bad taste.

I got the sampler platter for two because we wanted to try as much as possible to see what we like and what we don't. We had ribs, brisket, and pulled pork accompanied by Mac and cheese, cornbread, and sweet potato cross-cut fries. 

The brisket was good, but I personally prefer thicker slices. The ribs were great and cooked properly. The pulled pork was a little too dry. Mac and cheese didn't have enough cheese. Cornbread had great butter, but just didn't have the right texture to me. The sweet potato fries were fried really well.

I had their homemade sweet tea, but hopefully next time I'll try to hit up their bourbon selection. The sweet tea itself was a little too sweet, but maybe that was from the oranges they put into the tea.

Service was extremely friendly and courteous, there are a lot of staff in the restaurant for the space they have.

Prices are higher than what I'm used to paying for BBQ, but I suppose that's the sacrifice of not being in Atlanta or the Midwest US. The prices are reasonable sitting around ~$20-30/person.

Walking in, you can smell the smoker. Decor is rustic and the dim lighting helps with the look. The kitchen is open, so you can see everything that goes on. 

Definitely recommend this place. I'd like to try the beef ribs the next time I'm back, but the baby back ribs definitely have my seal of approval."}
{"text":"haven't tried this place yet, one star for the terrible reservation service... long story short , the lady who answered phone said she just need to grab her iPad to put us on waiting list then she put us on hold for 10 mins then hang up directly.... SERIOUSLY"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends, everyone was extremely satisfied with their meals and we all devoured everything to the very last scraps. The ribs were very good and the riblettes were extremely good as well with a spicy kick!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. The ribs were good, but not great. I felt like considering the size of the potato salad that came with it was too small to justify the $ I paid. I remember the ribs just being luke warm when it was served to us. 

I would come back if someone wanted to go without argument, but I probably would not think to go myself even though I live down the street."}
{"text":"Best yet.  I've been to 4-5 smokehouse type restos and this one is best.  The owner Alex came to the tables and chatted, recommended and provided beer samples. The sampler for 2 had more food than we could eat.  1/2 chicken 1/2 rack ribs and 1/4 lbs of peppercorn beef.  Sides were grilled corn (you have to try this!), beans were tasty, potato salad (which I usually don't like, was good, with full and hickory sticks). Brussels sprout side was great and the fries had a mild sweet aftertaste. The baby back ribs full order is massive and the service was great. Friendly and fast.  They changed the tv to the ball game for my son.  
Go there!  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner
Venue: Smoque N' Bones
Specialty: BBQ
Menu Items: Samuel Adams on tap, Cornbread, Pork Side Ribs, Mac & Cheese with Brisket, Chicken Wings and Bread Pudding

What would you attempt to barbecue if you knew you could not fail? Don't answer. Better yet, don't even try! Leave it to the experts at Smoque N' Bones to smoke your reasoning away and ignite your BBQ senses.

Cornbread spread with apple butter, pork side ribs with a dry rub and spicy hot wings are just a few of the smoking hot items at Smoque N' Bones. The recently opened BBQ spot in the Trinity Bellwoods area in Toronto, has been bringing to the great white north a side of southern hospitality that is sure to remind us why, when it comes to smoking meats, we ought to leave it to the experts.

Upon entering Smoque N' Bones, I realize this is no amateur spot. The place is small, homey and lively. Chefs and cooks move around in the small kitchen/bar area and create concoctions that make me salivate. The bar though small, has a selection of drinks and bourbons I can only long to taste. Samuel Adams on tap, Boston Lager to be exact, is the first thing I order. When indulging in a BBQ, there is often no room for anything else but beer, and great beer nonetheless.

The waitress, friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming, proceeds to explain what they are all about and recommends a few of her favourite menu items. Immediately after, corn bread arrives at our table with a side of homemade apple butter. Hello buttery pockets of goodness, these hips have missed you!

A little while after, I am greeted with the pork side ribs that are dried-rubbed with special spices. All I smell and taste is that smokiness effervescing off the rib meat. Sleeves up, hair up, I dig in. Moist and tender pieces of meat fall apart as I try and taste. Six bones later, another round of the Samuel Adams lager and I am ready for the next dish.

A mac & cheese with a side of brisket makes it to our table. I have to switch to a fork? No problem! Consider it done. The baked pasta dish is super creamy - not dry like some mac and cheese can get. It's cheesy. Very cheesy. It's rich, ooey, gooey, and, yeah - in my humble opinion - one of the best in the Tdot.

Back to hand-eating. The chicken wings tossed in a crazy hot sauce with blue cheese dip are in. My lips, after a few bites, are \"lipstick orange\". This is how I know the wings are good. Nothing more beautiful than showing off proudly that you love your chicken wings. The drumstick meat is super tender and the skin slightly crispy, but not heavily breaded. A perfect pairing to my beer selection for the night. Four wings in and it's time to reach for a napkin, and possibly a new pair of pants.

But then, there is always room for dessert, and this dessert is nothing short of fantastic. A bread pudding bathed in a bourbon caramel sauce puts a new lipstick shade on my lips. The bread pudding is good. But bread pudding covered in some sort of alcoholic sauce is really good. Kudos to Smoque N' Bones for putting together an end-to-end menu that is lip-licking good.

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"Small BBQ joint. The space itself is pretty small, the largest two tables seem to only sit 4 and then there were two high tops that would only seat 2 each and the rest of the seating area is at the bar. While seated at the bar you get a front row seat to your dinner being prepared, but makes it difficult to have conversation if your group is more than two. Our server was delightful and attentive blonde gal, making sure we had everything we needed and sharing pleasant conversation. We asked her about any drink/ lunch specials and told us they didn't have any that day. She offered some insight into other bars to check out in the neighborhood for drink specials. We ordered our food and it came out with great timing, was warm, and SO FLAVORFUL. I got the wings, they are prepared in a dry rub and served with celery and a creamy dill dipping sauce, ask for their spicy bbq sauce on the side for an extra kick! They were smokey, crisp and the meat was tender and moist. My friends ordered the pulled pork sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed the flavor and portion of pork, a side of Mac and cheese, and corn bread. The only downside is the portion of the mac and cheese, pricing around $7 or $8, and comes in the smallest dish. But despite the small portion the flavors and quality of the food were still stellar. If you're looking for a good quality bbq, check this place out. I would want to try the ribs next time, they looked epic."}
{"text":"We came to Smoque N Bones with a \"we want to try everything on the menu!\" attitude. I used OpenTable to set a 630 reservation. Upon arrival we were told by our server that we would basically need to complete our meal by 8pm because the table was reserved for another group - as if an hour and a half is enough time to dine at this restaurant considering it takes 30 mins or more for food to come out. When he realized this wasn't sitting well with us he backtracked and told us not to worry. While we enjoyed much of our $160 order (before the tip) the poor service that continued from the first instance soured our experience. 

To start we had . . .
The Cob Salad - upon arrival it came without the chicken. I notified the server and this was rectified. The onion overshadowed the entire salad. When moved aside the salad was decent but not worth the $14.90
The Beet Salad - my best friend had this salad and noted that it \"tastes likes beets\" she didn't say much else about it 

At some point after our starter order I noticed that the glasses they provided for water were dirty. I asked that they be replaced, our server seemed annoyed by the request (he was explained that it was soap scum but some of the glasses had what looked like left over food on them) but replaced the glasses. 

When our other friend arrived we ordered dinner. 
We had . . . 
2 of the 1/2 Chicken - oh em gee the chicken was good! 
A rack of ribs - they were well seasoned - a bit salty, but very good. 
1/4 lb of Brisket - this was also very good. There is a purple pickled veg served with it that blew me away. 
Potato Salad - meh
Sweet potato waffle fries - they were crispy and really good
Mac n Cheese - this dish was also a bit salty but overall very good. 

We also ordered corn on the cob and onion rings. Our orders took quite a while to come out yet this never came. When a tables food comes out it should all come out together (they did this for the pair to the left of us). We asked twice for these 2 sides. The server said they were coming. We were halfway into our meal (because we were hungry and didn't want to wait any longer to eat) and these 2 sides still didn't come out so we cancelled them.  They served full tables (who ordered after us) and for whatever reason these 2 sides did not come out for us. It left us feeling like our $160 order (before we each tipped our server on our separate bills) was of no value to them. 

Overall we were so turned off we each only ordered 1 drink and opted to go for Froyo for dessert instead of enduring another long wait for desserts that may or may not come out. 

All 3 of us agreed that while the food is OK the quality of the service makes this place not worth visiting a 2nd time. Pity."}
{"text":"Great bbq for downtown area
Small place but great atmosphere 
Recommend getting the sampler for 2 people since there's lots of food and it's a good price"}
{"text":"Just had the ribs for pick up, Great quality, filling and prepared fast."}
{"text":"We walked in the door and the place and it was packed.   The owner made room for us at the bar seating.   It was busy and the food took a little bit longer,  but it was worth every second of the wait.   The owner gave us things to test while we were waiting.   It's a great place I would suggest going here!"}
{"text":"You can tell how good ribs are by the smoke aroma in your fingers. After washing up, I enjoyed the bouquet for hours. 

I had the side ribs with cornbread for a quick lunch. The ribs were good but seemed a bit small for the price. 3 ribs and 2 mini loaves of cornbread for $17. I was hoping for about a half rack at that price. The ribs had great flavour, tons of smoke and a firm texture. 

The sugary butter spread for the cornbread was a real treat. 

But how did the ribs compare?  The travelling ribbers at Aurora Ribfest and other park events are much more tender and bigger portions. But they are competing against another pitmaster 10 feet away. Next best would be Memphis BBQ in Woodbridge. But if I'm downtown, it's a long way to go. So really, knowing that I am in the area, I might as well stop dreaming and just get into it!

Plan on ribs and a few sides to round out the meal, budgeting $30 before drinks, and you will leave fat and happy."}
{"text":"This place opened not too long ago down the street from us, and with both of us being huge BBQ lovers, we knew we had to try it out. The brisket sandwich was delicious - simple, and not over-thought or over-sauced, which I like. Ribs were delicious - fall off the bone, not huge but delicious and cooked perfectly.

I think a lot of people don't realize that this place is licensed! And they have a great cocktail menu 

For sides: Macaroni was a bit bland, baked beans were sweet and addictive. 

Great service and staff!"}
{"text":"Ive been literally to every corner in USA for BBQ so anything outside of America will be hard to beat!!! Make no mistake i am a BBQ connoisseur.

This place is located next to the 7-11 with zero parking around. We asked the cashier at 7-Eleven if we can park in the corner of their lot, and he obliged but we bought some stuff off of 7-Eleven as well. You can literally pass by this place and not see anything so I'm using the 7-Eleven as a landmark.

You walk in and the tables are very small or there is bar seating. This is why it is a good idea to make a reservation for this place especially if you know you're going to be coming on a busy night like a Saturday or Friday. 

I sat by the bar so I was able to see the girl making the drinks I ordered their signature drink which is like an 86 or something like that it was very good. 

Everything is cooked out in the open if you sit by the bar so it's interesting to see what they're making for everybody. 

The big mistake that I made is that I just ordered off the menu but really look to see what everyone else is ordering because you may be disappointed. I ordered the brisket the smallest brisket they had and they were very thin slices of beef and I did not get full at all so I had to end up getting other things. 

The highlight of my meal was the smoked chicken wings they were very good! They are smoked and then they flash fry it upon order. Make sure you ask for some of their magic rub because that seasoning is literally what will make a kick out of everything. 

This place was nothing to write home about and I have had bigger portions a barbecue elsewhere but if you're looking for a cute scenspot with some pretty good grub come here!"}
{"text":"I visited on a Wednesday night.  The food was delicious and tasteful. I ordered the sampler for two, which is way more food than for two. You get a choice of 3 meats and 3 sides.  We chose the peppercorn beef ribs& chicken with Mac & cheese coleslaw and waffle sweet potato fries. 

My top fav were the mac & cheese and the ribs the only thing I didn't care for was the waffle sweet potato fries.

I would of gave five stars but the air conditioning want working and it was extremely hot in there I was dripping with sweat. It was quite uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Went there last week late at night. We wanted to sit upstairs but they closed the area so we sat downstairs

Ambiance ( Medieval tavern)
I play video games and this gave me the feeling of walking into a tavern straight from the Witcher series (slavic medieval fantasy). Their decor compliments that setting. I absolutely love how they prepare the food in front of you and leave you drooling over it. Needless to say that it is pretty loud just like any other tavern in medieaval times ;) and they have loud music (Jazz?) playing, definitely not a place where you will be able to talk comfortably

Food:
I had the half chicken, it came with a paint brush and bar be que sauce! PAINT BRUSH! that won my heart, 10/10 for creativity. The idea is to paint the sauce on your food with that brush (thanks cap'n obvious). The chicken was really good, flavourful and juicy, slightly burnt to contribute to the smokey flavour. My foody partner ordered a pulled chicken sandwhich and the cool slaw on top of it is a really neat idea.

oh and one of the best sweet potato fries I have ever had! Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and just done perfectly!

They have a huge selection of drinks, they make it with pickles and what not, sounds cool but we were not in the mood for alcohol se we left it.

NOTE: they don't have beef ribs here yet, it shows on the menu but they don't make it yet.
NOTE**: They do have beef ribs now, they were about $18 bucks, price not listed on the menu.

In short, loved the ambiance and the food was really good as well. Will go again and try different stuff, particularly beef ribs when they start making it."}
{"text":"Made a reservation through OpenTable and was asked to select a 'table type' and I selected 'Standard' coz I don't want to dine in the bar or counter. But guess what, we still ended up sitting in one of the most uncomfortable bar stool you can imagine! We asked if we can go to the 2nd floor and they said it's not open, we asked if we can seat in one of their 4 seater table since it's not busy anyway and they said no too. So we were given a table underneath the stairs and we're really disappointed coz why do you get to choose your table upon reservation and in the end they put you to this lousy inconvenient tables/area. Plus the tables/stools are so tiny that you don't have anyplace to put down your coat.  Yes they do have a coat rack, the kind that can accommodate 2-3 coats lol. And since there's already coats hanging in the rack, our coats stayed in our lap for the duration of our dining. Talk about having an enjoyable dinner, NOT!

And the food, OMG I don't understand why people give this restaurant 4 or 5 stars since the food is nothing spectacular!  

Ordered the following BBQ:

- 1/2 lbs Side Ribs - they were tough and dry. For $19.90 you would think that you're getting at least decent ribs but oh no you're not! I'd rather eat Swiss Chalet's ribs (and I hate hate Swiss Chalet) that's when you know Smoque N' Bones' ribs are bad.

- Their Smoked Chicken ($16.90) is the same story, tasted more like burnt than smokey.

SIDES:

- Sweet Potato Waffle Fries($7.90) - of all the food we ordered, this is the only thing we enjoyed. The natural sweetness of the potatoes and its crunchy texture makes this an okay dish.

- Grilled Corn with Chipotle Mayo & Smoked Cheddar (6.90) - they split 1 corn into two, slathered it with mayo and cheese and charge you almost 7 bucks for a side that doesn't even taste good. Nothing special, I bet you can make this yourself and it won't cost you this much.

Overall after experiencing back problems and sore behind (from the hard uncomfortable stools), unaccommodating service and uninspired/expensive food, there's no way I'm coming back here."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! I had the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and my partner had ribs and macaroni and cheese. We shared sweet potato fries. Everything was delicious. We ordered this in using foodora so can't speak to a dining experience at the restaraunt, but can say this is the best pulled pork I've had in the city!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with a friend, really enjoyed it! The bar upstairs was nice and quiet, although we did arrive past midnight to begin with... They have a great selection of scotch, whiskey, and bourbon which is wonderful!! The bartender was friendly and makes a pretty awesome Rum Old Fashioned, interestingly they used coconut water ice cubes instead of regular ice cubes, and I have to say, it really did taste better! Maybe it was just a placebo effect, but it was a great new twist. 
Last call us around 1-1:30 I believe - I did have a couple of those Rum Old Fashioned - which I thought was a bit early, but I still thoroughly enjoyed my brief visit to Smoque N Bones. Definitely would come back!"}
{"text":"Take out was pretty quick, it's annoying constantly getting TIP pushed on you.  You can't eat, drink anything without extra steps to drain you off extra cash, I respect places that pay a decent enough wage and don't BEG.  Plus when you are paying $22 plus for a side and a sandwich, it's already too much.  Leaves this being a one-time experience.  Expensive.  Really all the bbq in Toronto is over-priced, you really need to go to rural/smaller USA to encounter a deal, when did ribs and wings become such a commodity?!  If it gets busy it's also annoying, narrow and the exit/entrance is in the way of customers and staff."}
{"text":"They had the best deep fried chicken I've ever had in Toronto. The potato salad was incredible and went well with the chicken. Sadly we got the last two seats at the bar and the bartender was absolutely horrible. He forgot part of our order and never checked up on us once. When we were leaving I said \"Thankfully the food was amazing or I wouldn't come back\" and he said \"Yeah great food and shitty service\" I agreed and left. I'll definitely be back but I'll avoid the bar area if he's around."}
{"text":"We really like bbq and we were told to try this restaurant, and we were not disappointed. The service was excellent - we asked for recommendations and were given great ones. Our drinks were the best we'd ever tried. The food came out quickly and it was fantastic. I'd absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Most excellent BBQ! Beats many of the KC BBQ places I've been to and I'm from Kansas. Top notch, excellent service, delicious BBQ. Next time I'm in Toronto I will visit again. Final word AWESOME!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here 4 times so far and even brought some of our friends with us.

3 out of the 4 times the food was amazing. The pulled pork sandwich is slightly tangy which makes it really good. The ribs are great and the string fries and onion rings are really good and some of our favourites. Quite honestly 3 out of 4 times the food has been 4 stars and the best southern food I have eaten yet. 

The only downside is that the last time we went both the food and the service were more like 1 star. Our ribs were burnt (to the point where all you tasted was burnt food) and the half chicken was still cold on the inside. It also took a very long time to get a refill on our water and when we left I felt like I had filled up on fries and water for dinner! They did not charge for the ribs which was fair. I think it was just an off night for them. 

I've given 3 stars as an average for my cumulative experience."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome service. Seating is tight, but we were able to get seated without reservations."}
{"text":"First time having bar-b-que while in Canada & let's just say my family & I was very happy with our dinner. The corn fell off the cob as soon as I bit into it. Beef ribs were charred perfectly with a side of bar-b-que sauce. The cornbread was moist & served with sweet butter."}
{"text":"small portions of bbq seems seems just wrong.  its really more of a burbon cocktail bar, probably should have had some.  very small, very chique.  they do take out."}
{"text":"If you are looking for the best ribs and corn muffins this is the place. I think their ideal target market might be groups of 2-4 men, who probably have a tattoo somewhere, wear dark clothing, maybe a dark flannel shirt, and black jeans, leather shoes. Taller chairs, loud music, classic rock. Alternatively for whomever wearing whatever, but count on a teeny tiny bit of attitude if you don't fit their ideal target market. But I feel \"screw that\" and be happy eating the ribs and corn muffins and taking in the vibe anyway :) 
It is very, very, very tasty. 
Hands down the best ribs and best corn muffins I have ever had. Kudos to the chef! And great music choices. Will be here again. In darker clothing next time :D #ribs #cornmuffin #bikervibe #queenstwest"}
{"text":"The dishes unfortunately were not as tasty as they looked. The briskets were thinly sliced and dry. Both baby back and side ribs were also tougher than we would've liked. Def pales in comparison to Cherry St BBQ, but an okay option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Ordered the sampler consisting of brisket, ribs and chicken. The beef brisket was amazing.  Tender and juicy. Just the right amount of fat on it. The pickled purple cabbage that came with it was out of the world. The BBQ chicken was nice and moist. The ribs were a bit burnt for my taste. Could taste the char and had to scrape off some of it. 

Would definitely try again but will concentrate on the briskets."}
{"text":"A cozy place. I was very impressed during my first visit, but the baby back ribs tasted a bit dry during my most recent visit. Not a fan of the sampler for two. 
limited seats, I tried to walk-in once, and it was fully booked for the night."}
{"text":"Service 2/5 - waiter forgot drinks and did revisit the table more than once during dinner

Food 2/5 - ribs were very dry and chewy. Onion rings had a very flavorful batter, and the Brussels sprouts were pretty good. Despite the sides being decent, this is a smokehouse and with a four star rating we expected much better ribs. Would not recommend if you're looking for better than average, especially given the price of the food ($$$)"}
{"text":"I had made a reservation at Smoque N/ Bones for a Saturday evening as a gesture to my husband for having stepped up around the house considerably during my pregnancy.  I had wanted to surprise him, and was disappointed when we arrived to find that they did not have our reservation recorded despite that I had email confirmation to demonstrate that I had in fact made a booking for that day and time.  They did find a table for us, however, and our experience ended up being pretty good.

I'm not a huge meat eater (again, I had chosen the restaurant for my husband rather than for myself) and so I clarified with the server what to expect with the beef brisket.  I asked if I could get an extra lean cut, and he confirmed that I could.  Unfortunately, either my definition of \"lean\" did not match his, or else the message got lost before getting to the kitchen.  My beef came out extremely fatty.  I ate as much as I could without complaint, though.  The grilled corn, however, was AMAZING.  Highly recommended!

Even if I had been able to eat all of the beef, the 1/4lb portion was quite small and wouldn't have been enough.  In addition to the beef and the corn, I ended up ordering a side order of macaroni and cheese, as well as the kettle chips.  Both were quite good.

As for my husband, he ordered a 1/2 rack of pork side ribs and potato salad.  His portion size was more than sufficient; he ended up bringing some home to eat the next day.  He has told me multiple times since our visit to Smoque N' Bones that \"those were the best ribs (he had) ever eaten\".  I neglected to get feedback on his potato salad.

Despite the issues I've mentioned, the \"feel\" of the place along with the service (Shaun was great!) made our experience quite enjoyable.  I'd be happy to go back, though I would likely try the chicken sandwich or cobb salad instead.  As for my husband, I asked him if he'd consider returning, and he said \"definitely\".

***UPDATE***  
We had decided to take a group back to Smoque N' Bones to celebrate the birthday of my husband and his twin brother.  Although my husband and I were planning on having attended this dinner kid-free, our son had other plans and ended up being born three weeks early.  This meant that either I would miss out, or we would bring our baby along, who was less than two weeks old at the time.  This dinner was scheduled for early on a Sunday evening when the restaurant wasn't likely to be busy, so we opted for the latter.  I emailed the restaurant in advance and asked if they could accommodate stroller parking and if they could give us a \"standard\" table rather than a high top.  They were happy to do both.   All of the people we interacted with at the restaurant were incredibly willing to accommodate, making sure that the music wasn't too loud and that the temperature was alright.  It was our first meal out with our newborn, and we really appreciated the lengths that the staff at Smoque N' Bones went to to make it a good experience.  Thank you, Smoque N' Bones staff!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, love it.
You get a lot of food for the price!  Loved the sampler as well and such a good price.
The corn on the cob was amazing.  Defn recommend that.
Had the pork ribs, brisket, sausage.  Ribs by far was my fav.   Sausage was ok, but who doesn't love brisket.
Kettle chips, fries, onion rings ....yah can't hate on any of those choices. All tasty. Mac and Cheese was so/so  I wouldn't get this again 
Didn't care for the corn bread personally though.

I tried the Maple Bacon Old Fashioned.  Not very good personally.  

But honestly, I will come back.  Those ribs, the bbq sauce, that corn.  YES!"}
{"text":"Was in Toronto on vacation and this place did not disappoint. Great food and great service. If you're in Toronto you have to come here!"}
{"text":"Came here on a very hot day, which was a bad idea. It doesn't feel like they have AC, especially since every door and window was open. Tables are limited (5 tables max), bar seating available. Ordered a platter of a sort, ribs were slightly over charred, chicken was good, brisket was great, and waffle fries were delicious.  I really don't recommend coming here on a sweltering hot day as the smoke from the bbq makes it very hot and humid. Also be prepared to sit along the bar as table seating is limited. 
The waiter was good, very friendly and attentive. There was only one waiter at the time we went - not sure if this is the norm, but if all the tables are occupied, and the bar has more then 4 patrons, the service will be a bit slower then usual.  Overall, i think there are other bbq joints in the GTA that are a lot better, but if you're in the area, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"The first time I ever went to Smoque N' Bones, I had just walked for about 3 hours with my girlfriend. We were starving, and the smell from the place with the giant open front window led us, entranced, right to its door.

As we sat down at the rustic bar, the place alight with activity and a loud but friendly buzz, we stared on as, before us, the talented staff began to assemble the next round of ribs, wings, and brisket.

I stared in awe at the craftsmanship as each carefully-procured and delicately-prepared morsel of meat was bathed before me in the glistening glory of the place's signature secret sauce -- a sauce so glorious that not even the place's delicious corn-bread or incredible fries can best it.

The owner caught my eye, seeing my mouth watering before him, and as he cut the ribs for a take-out order, he placed a piece in front of me, free of charge.

It was at that moment that I knew I was never going for backyard BBQ anywhere else again."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! My wife & I ordered the mac & cheese with pulled pork & a half of rack of ribs to share. For us two, the amount was perfect & the pulled pork was soooo tender & juicy! Loved this place, you guys need a store in Philadelphia, I would be a loyal customer!"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this spot out and finally got the chance Friday night. I will certainly be back.

We ordered the 1/2 ribs, pulled pork, with fries, cole slaw and onion rings as sides. 
We both ordered beer recommended by our server and we both really enjoyed it, though I can'f  for the life of me remember the name.

Our food came quickly and our server was cheerful and attentive. My fave hands down were the ribs. Made just the way I like them, a charred crispyness, not at all fatty - you have to work to get it off the bone, and oh, so tasty.  I preferred mine with the dry rub only. It had a subtle apple flavour. The sauce was good, but I was happy to leave it on the side where I found it.  

Onion rings were delicate and delicious. Fries felt like they needed a little something, but we ate them all without complaint. My date loved the cole slaw and the pulled pork, but I was all about the ribs.

Music fluctuated between really loud and a conversational volume. Not sure what was going on there, but I prefer not to yell over dinner. 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is popular and it's hard to get a table for same day bookings. If you don't want to eat at the bar and want to ensure you get a table, book a week in advance. 

If it's your first time, I'd recommend the sampler. You'll get to try 3 different meats and sides. The BBQ pork is fantastic. You can taste the smokiness and succulent flavour. Next time I will be getting a full rack instead of a half rack. The corn and corn bread are great too. The corn bread is fresh and moist. And the corn has some great spice and kick to it. 

I also like the aesthetic of the restaurant. Reminiscent of a western saloon. From the repurposed whiskey water bottles, to the wood bar & panelling, and amazing selection of whiskey + bourbon. I highly recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"It was purely by chance that I ended up here for lunch. I was attending an event nearby and happened to park very close by. I remember reading some good reviews so it seemed like a good opportunity to try it.

At first impression, the place is very narrow and dark, even though the entire front of the restaurant was open and it was a bright sunny day. It wasn't so bad once my eyes got used to the low light. It appears they have a dining room upstairs but it wasn't busy enough to have it in use.

I ordered the BBQ Rib Tips and the Shoestring Fries. The fries arrived first, thin and very crispy, with a dip (chipotle aioli, I'm guessing). They were good! The rib tips were served in a small metal pan, similar to the fries. Very rustic.

Judging from the texture, I'm guessing the rib tips were lightly dusted, fried, and then tossed in BBQ sauce. The vinegar based sauce was good but a little bit too tangy for my taste. I prefer sweet sauces. Maybe I would have liked it even more if there was less sauce on it.

If this place was closer to home, I would go back to try more of their menu, especially some of their bourbon offerings. I will, however, keep it in mind if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Lucky enough to come with a big enough group so we could eat the whole meat menu and try some sides. The real standout meat would have to be the ribs. Well smoked and slightly crusty on the outside and ends, while still holding on to the necessary juice at the more meaty parts. It hardly needed any BBQ sauce brushing for either flavor or moisture. Surprisingly the next favourites would be the two sides we ordered. The buttermilk onion rings were thin sweet, crunchy yet tender at the same time. One of the best I've had. The Brussel sprouts are the perfect introduction (or reintroduction) for people who don't like Brussel sprouts. The outside layers were charred and didn't carry the usual bitterness that comes with the vegetable. The rest of the meat dishes sadly faded into the background of protein that needed to be painted with BBQ sauce before consuming.

Word of advice would be not to come when you are seriously hungry. There was a long wait between putting in our orders and actually getting any food. There seemed to be alot of takeout orders leaving the building, but nothing getting to our table. I know that there is a reasonable delay when you order the whole meat menu, but 45 minutes seems like a really long time to wait. The service was great and friendly, but the wait was just killer."}
{"text":"Went here in May 2017 - so good! Loved the cornbread, the baked beans, the ribs, everything was delicious. Prices were also fair. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I always love me some good Southern BBQ in the six. This place has an upstairs for bigger crowds, bar seats, a couple of tables. The service was great, and quick.

We ordered the pork ribs, buttermilk chicken bites, sweet potato waffle fries, and beef brisket. 
The pork ribs were nice and smokey, good flavour nice black bark on the outside for people that love it, but I wasn't to crazy about it. I love their beef brisket... I'm not a fan of beef brisket but this was the star dish for me. Soooo soft and tender! You won't regret getting this. The chicken bites were good but not great, I love the creamy dill sauce but the chicken seasoning was a little too pickly for me. Waffle fries were great and crispy! 

Overall great experience! I would come back for some beef brisket for sure!"}
{"text":"Only the pork or beef ribs are good, brisket was disappointing, sausage was terribly salty, so were the onion rings. I think I drank at least 2L of water after that meal. 
Why can't ppl just keep it simple and good!"}
{"text":"I came here as the result of social food group. We tried a little bit of everything. Even with the very large group, the food came out perfect! The favourites of the night were the pulled pork sandwich and the ribs. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"What's left to be said about this place? There's a reason for the stockpile of reviews - and good ones too! If you're craving smoky, comforting, delicious BBQ meats with a nice flavourful kick, this place is for you. Located in the heart of Queen West, we visited on a Tuesday evening and the place was packed - so word of warning, note that space is pretty intimate, limited, and narrow. Although we did enjoy our experience here, we probably would have enjoyed it more if we hadn't been cramped at the back corner of the bar.

We ordered the pulled pork ($8.90 for a half size), beef brisket ($11.90 for a half size), half-sized smoked chicken ($14.90), brussel sprouts ($6.90), and buttermilk onion rings ($6.90). The brussel sprouts were a bit too salty for our liking, but everything else was delicious. The onion rings are perfectly crispy, and the meats are lathered in flavour with a smokiness that's cooked to perfection. 

If you haven't been here yet, stop by when you have a chance - especially if you're a dedicated carnivore, or just a lover of all things BBQ. Prices are reasonable, and service was very quick and friendly. We will definitely be back when we're in the area again."}
{"text":"great bbq restaurant. it's very similar to Big Crow (Annex) and has some similar items as Local 1794 (danforth east). 

i especially loved the sampler for two. it gives you a great amount of meat with a good spread of options. the sauce brush is a clever feature too.

i think the restaurant is relatively new, but perhaps adding tables for bigger groups than 6 would be a good idea. otherwise, keep up the great work. looking forward to going there again."}
{"text":"I've been to a few solid BBQ joints in the states recently.  Q39, Joe's, Jack Stacks, CharBar in KC, and the Commissary in Memphis.  Usually when you order bbq, it comes with your choice of 1 or 2 sides included in the price.  I couldn't believe my ears when the waiter said that the $10 for 1/4lb brisket didn't come with any sides.  At this point, I figured \"well, if it's $10, they must give you a lot more than 1/4lb if there's no sides\".

Nope.

2 thin slices.  $10.  All in, my bill came to $16 for 2 slices of mediocre brisket, a scoop of soggy pickled cabbage, and 2 (actually decent) corn bread muffins.

Also, no burnt ends if anyone is wondering."}
{"text":"I thought this smokehouse was pretty average. Nothing really blew my mind and the food was decent. I ordered brisket, and rather than the staff telling me in advance that the kitchen ran out of brisket so I could've ordered something else, she brought me the peppercorn beef which was nothing I was craving... I would've ordered the ribs... but at this point it would've been pointless because I would've had to wait longer for my food and I had to be somewhere after dinner. Overall, meh experience and food."}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place for weeks now!

The place has 2 floors, 2 bars, and no room to breath. Tables for maximum profits.
 
We ordered the 2 PEOPLE SAMPLER to go. It cost $70 with tax.

When we got home and opened the order, we felt guilty for having spent so much money on so little food. The food looked and tasted OK. 

We were disappointed to be honest, as all the reviews make it sounds like the food will be amazing. 

It was not.

Food portion to dollar 1/5
Beef Brisket 2/5

{"text":"Smoque N' Bones was great - I ordered the pulled pork which was very flavorful, and had a good sauce-to-meat ratio.
The staff was attentive, and food came out quickly. We sat at the kitchen bar which scored us an extra order of sweet potato waffle fries which is always appreciated!

The only cons I would say are that the restaurant is very small, and therefore wait times can be high. Also, I left there smelling like BBQ from head to toe, but whether that's good or bad is subjective :)"}
{"text":"Drinks are really good here! I had the Maple Bacon Old Fashioned and the Texas Tornado.

Our group of 5 girls had the ribs, beef brisket, pulled pork, cobb salad, chicken wings, collard greens, shoestring fries and onion rings. There was more than enough for all of us. The fries were better than McDonalds. Is that even possible? I liked the ribs and pulled pork the best!"}
{"text":"Love the ribs! Have been on a few occasions (really, just for the ribs). Have also tried the brisket but personally thought they precut it into slices that were too thin. The sausage and chicken wings are also terrific."}
{"text":"Myself and my friend decided to dine here for my birthday during the afternoon. The time was around 2:00pm and the restaurant itself was rather slow when we entered, but soon after a rush of customers came one after another. Good thing we came early.

The restaurant's decor has a distinct rustic look with the wood bar and tables, high stools and metal serving trays; very much suited for a BBQ joint. The restaurant itself is not big, but there are a few tables and ample seats at the bar. There is also an upstairs section, but i was not sure how large that area is. If you are looking to have large groups, you might have to split.

Since it was two people and our first time here, the Sampler seemed like a best option. ($48.90) You get to choose 3 meats and 3 sides. We had the pork ribs, half chicken and peppercorn beef for the meats. For the sides it was sweet potato waffle fries, buttermilk onion rings and the mac n' cheese.

The sweet potato waffle fries served with chipotle mayo were just fantastic. Not being a huge sweet potato fan, i would have these over any other regular fries. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, it was a great combination with the sauce. The buttermilk onion rings were just as good as the waffle fries. The batter was crispy while still be light and was a great contrast to the very filling and heavier waffle fries. The portions for the both of those were huge and definitely worth it. The last side was the mac n' cheese which was great for what it was. A good balance and effort, but definitely not as great as the other two. A very standard take on mac n' cheese.

For the meats, the ribs were definitely the best selection. Ribs were meaty, smoked well and had a great outer crust. With the ribs they had less sauce but this is accompanied with the helping of their BBQ sauce and brush. This allows every customer to sauce to their likely. My company loves sauce while i like my ribs a little drier than he does for example. This also applies with their chicken and BBQ sauce. Tender and juicy with a layer of BBQ on the chicken, the chicken was another fantastic choice. On the other side, the peppercorn beef didn't impress as much as the other proteins. The beef alone was not as tender and with the combination with the two sauces that came with it, the beef became a tad too salty for my liking.
 
The service was great, the person who served us was attentive, fast and very kind. This was the kind of service you would want at any restaurant. Smoque N' Bones is hands down of the one of the best BBQ restaurants in Toronto with a great selection and superb service, making it now my go-to for BBQ carvings. 

Side note: They also have take-out great for those serving multiple guests!"}
{"text":"The ribs that I got is completely burnt!!!! It is the third time ordering this, and the first two times were ok, so tonight when my friend came by and wanted some good ribs and enjoy a xbox game night, I ordered this online and waited at home for the meal to come..... The only problem is that when we got it, the supposedly delicious ribs is totally burnt in the outside, you can even scrub completely burnt black bits from the rib... So we had to throw away the 33 dollar rack of ribs and order something else when we were already starving. 
Will never order here again in my life, and I suggest that you don't come here if you really value your health. After all, burnt meat causes cancer."}
{"text":"Me and my friends decided to try this place as we heard great things. We tried the sampler, which you had to chose 3 mains and 3 sides. We got the pulled pork, the sausage and the ribs as our mains. Our sides included the sweet potato waffle fries, the onion rings and the Marconi. 

For some reason I enjoyed the sides more than the main dishes. The waffle fries were really delicious and they give you a generous portion. The Main dishes were cool also, you get to season them yourself. 

Overall great experience and the staff were really friendly."}
{"text":"BBQ (southern?) style food full of flavour. What's not to love? Went there with a girl friend and shared a bunch of dishes, we loved them all- careful not to fill up on beer before as the dishes are al full fat and sit heavy. I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"Awsome smokey flavour envelops all there dishes. 

I have eaten the ribs and brisket an both would get a five star rating.

The ceaser here is particularly good with a smokey taste to it.

Only reason it missed on 5 stars is that I find the portions small an the price high for a classic Bbq spot, but great food an cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Satisfied our bbq craving. The ribs were amazing and to die for. They give lots of food so come hungry"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and oh my lord, it was beyond incredibleee..we were 3 guys and have 2 meals for 2 people..we had the chicken, which was amazinggg. Then the owner, Alex recommended the beef ribs..that was by far the highlight of the night. Amazinggg vibe, friendly staff..jst hands down..its a gem!"}
{"text":"In Toronto for a couple days - looking for great ribs.  Wished I was traveling with a friend so that we could try the Sampler Platter for 2 @ $60 - looked like it would have been a great way to try out all of their meats and sides.  Great selection of offerings - almost overwhelming.  Atmosphere is great - small place - sitting at the bar put you right in the action watching all of the orders prepared. 

So why the 3 stars?  I'm not used to having ribs where the last step is to completely char it on an open flame.   To me, it tasted burnt and dry.    The host wasn't super friendly and I didn't realize he was my waiter as well until he came back 15 minutes after seating me (I was very thirsty by that time!).   One of the leather aproned cooks was friendly and made my meal pleasant."}
{"text":"If you can't post your menu on Yelp, you obviously want to fail. Also the menu in your website is so not phone friendly! There are so many other great BBQ places in the area, why should I bother?!"}
{"text":"We went here for my brother's b-day.  My sister booked us a reservation. However; we had to wait 20 minutes before being seated because the server/ hostess did not want to disrupt the other people in our reserved table, which were done their meal and were sitting around with water and chatting - the quintessential indication of a completed meal!

Thankfully, this meant that we could find a seat upstairs, which was being opened for their dinner service. They had their upstairs booked but a time window of an hour and a 45 mins was more than enough time. We ate our meal gleefully. 

We ordered: The Sampler for two with 1/2 rack, beef brisket, and sausage and corn bread, Brussels sprouts and some pickled cabbage. Additionally the onion rings and a beet salad for my dad and brother. I ordered: a Cobb salad minus the bacon and sweet potato waffle fries and my sister ordered the chicken poppers and the shoestring fries. 

We also ordered a couple of housemade root beers and some cranberry juice. 

The atmosphere was alright. Their upstairs was echoey,  and a little on the cold side. The chairs are incredibly uncomfortable but I gather they do not desire for guests to linger there long. As well as to add to the aesthetic of the bourbon bar. 

Over all the food was delicious. I'd return."}
{"text":"went there with my girlfriend and 2 friends on a Friday evening. We did not have reservations, so we had to wait 15 minutes for a table to open up for us.  We were seated on the second floor.

Ambiance: (3.5 stars)
The music is a bit too loud, and the place was a bit crowded (Seats close to other tables...).  The seats were on stools/bench so it was not the greatest. 

Service (4.5 stars)
The waiters really knew what they were talking about, we asked for suggestions for portion size and they have and they helped.  
We ordered the cocktails and they were as delicious as advertised. 

In the washroom they ran out of paper to dry your hands (not a big deal, but it shows lack of commitment).


Food (3 stars)
I have been looking for a place that services this kind of food for a while, and I am sad to say that I was disappointed.
The brisket had quite a bit of fat (3 stars) the ribs were a tad dry (3.5 stars)  Pulled pork was likely the best thing we ordered.  (4 stars).  

The total came to 160 with tax and tip for 4 cocktails, 3 meals, and 2 sides.  


Would go again if I am craving pulled pork, or if I am in the neighborhood.  Would not go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"My wife and I were on vacation in Toronto and I am a BBQ junkie and there are only a few in Toronto, so I had to try this place.

It is very small, but the food was AMAZING! I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side of baked beans. The beans came out first and they were beautiful, a little sweet and almost al dente. A little more firm than American baked beans, but I actually liked them better than our version, which are really tender.

The pork sandwich came out and it was fork ready, because it was too large to eat as a sandwich.

It is kind of cool that the chef is cooking right in front of you (It is that small!) Our service was fantastic and they have multiple beers on tap.

Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Good bbq without a doubt... the mac & chees pulled pork special hits the spot everytime..."}
{"text":"Simply put - if I ever have to choose my last meal, here's hoping Smoque N Bones caters. This is, hands down, the best BBQ I've ever had. 

My boyfriend and I chose this place as our anniversary dinner locale after reading the fantastic reviews, and it didn't disappoint. As newbies, we opted for the Sampler Platter for 2 ($50). Ask if any additional meats are available; we opted for the pulled chicken and peppercorn steak which our waiter mentioned, but was not included in the menu. 

The sampler did not disappoint. The ribs were fall off the bone perfection, perfectly cooked with a little char but still soft, and not too chewy. The sauce on the side meant dressing them up or down to your little heart's content. The pulled chicken was incredibly flavourful, which is rare for any chicken dish without heaping piles of sauce on. The peppercorn steak was probably my favourite meat dish, perfectly spiced with a side of beets and caramalized onions. And for the sides - the cornbread. Just do it. Fluffy, warm, and topped with butter spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg, it gives the cornbread a slight pumpkin-spice taste, which is literally pretty much the best thing since sliced (corn)bread. 

We also loved the open concept kitchen - the chef was chatting with patrons at the bar while he cooked their food on the grill, and returned my grin across the room as I drifted off into a meat coma. Plus there are no walls dividing you from the heavenly smells rising from that grill, and that my friends, is a beautiful thing.

Would recommend reservations as the seating is limited - 2 tables for 2, 2 tables seating 4 - 6, and about 10 - 15 stools at the bar."}
{"text":"Arrived here 30mins after opening to a locked door. This was the beginning to a bad experience. Looking through the window, a staff came and opened the door. Took a look at the menu and went with the Brussels sprouts, pulled pork and brisket. As I wait at the counter I was disappointed seeing that the pulled pork and brisket were being pulled out of the refrigerator and reheated on the hot plate. This was enough to ruin my appetite but I was starving and beggars can't be choosers. 

Pulled pork and brisket were dry and the saving grace here was the Brussels sprouts. Would come back again solely for the sprouts but was severely disappointed knowing that the meats are just reheated and not fresh."}
{"text":"Decent BBQ, poor service.  We waited for about 20 minutes and when a table opened up, they wouldn't seat us.  Said we needed 1 extra person for them to sit us at this table for 4.  It was just two of us, but mind you it was 8:30p, there were no reservations coming, and there was no one else waiting!  They had told a couple that just arrived it would be a 45 minute wait.  Thankfully a couple of seats at the bar just opened for us.  The two seats next to us cleared about 5 minutes later.  Once we sat, we ordered the sampler.  Good quantity of food but just okay BBQ.  Was not worth the wait.  Plus, no silverware until we asked for some, and drinks took forever to come.  All in all, servers were useless.  It's not a big place, so It wasn't like they were super busy.  That table btw sat empty the whole time we were there.  And, we had to get up to ask for our check.  3 for the food, minus 1 star for the (lack of) service."}
{"text":"Barbeque, barbecue, BBQ... YAY!! I love me some good barbeque, and it had been long overdue for me to finally check out some of the local barbeque joints. 

I stopped in here with a friend from out of town late on a Thursday evening. It is pretty dark and quaint inside and was almost completely full so we were seated at the bar which was great. Our server was friendly and helpful when it came to questions about the menu. We were both very hungry and decided to split the two person sampler plate. The three meats we got were pulled pork, ribs, and beef brisket. It was delicious!! I think we agreed that the pulled pork and the ribs were our favourite. Although it all was very good, and we were pleased with our choice. The corn bread with the maple-sugar type butter is reallyyy yummy and I had to be mindful to not eat it all to save room for the what I was really there for.. the meat!! We felt that for the sampler the price was fair and the portions were good. I would most definitely recommend stopping in to Smoque N' Bones if you are in the hood or if you are like me and just love barbeque. I plan on going back very soon :):)"}
{"text":"Loved the ribs! Very tasty and melt in your mouth kind! Ordered the onion rings as well, delicious! Wished the beer on tab was colder but other than that everything was amazing! Will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"BEST ribs in Toronto! My hubby and I split a baby back rack and they were awesome. The chef also gave us a regular rib to try and it was awesome as well! Mac and cheese is so good and flavourful. It's a small place, but has serious flavour!"}
{"text":"This rating is given by a tiny eater like myself. I did enjoy my experience here but the menu was limited and pricey- after all, they specialize in ribs. I ordered the starter riblets with BBQ sauce, my boyfriend got the buttermilk chicken and we shared the sweet potato waffle fries (thank you Yelpers for the recommendation!). 

The riblets were the ends of the rack and the bbq sauce was amazing! The chicken was insanely juicey and tender with a thin crisp batter. The chicken alone wasn't special and almost tasted too dull but with the spicy mayo, it was something else! Sweet potato fries also came with the spicy mayo. We loved that each fry was evenly seasoned without overpowering the sweet potato taste. 

After this meal though, I was EXTREMELY thirsty. The food was tasty overall but this kind of meaty restaurant just isn't my type."}
{"text":"BBQ Heaven - if there is such a thing. Had a rough week? How about having a cheat day? Look no further, Smoque N' Bones, is the place to devour hundreds of pounds of delicious BBQ (ok, that is a lie)! Honestly, I couldn't have picked a better place for late birthday celebrations with my friends - be adventureous and try new restaurants like I have been recently). 

Ordered:
1) Mac N' Cheese $5.90
- this is like a little tease. At first I was like \"this is puny.\" Trust me, once you go down the list of what my friends and I ordered, you will realize that this order was way more than enough

2) Pulled Pork Mac N' Cheese $12.90
- downright delicious, pulled pork was very savoury
- highly recommend you share this with another friend, especially if you order more food (you will need the space in your stomach)

3) Rib Tips $9.90
- perfect appetizer to split with a few friends 
- chunky pieces of deep fried meat in hot bbq sauce (good amount of spicy)

4) Sweet Potato Fries $6.90
- Where do you usually find this in the city? My friends and I really liked this

5) Baby Back Ribs $37
- meat, meat, and more meat
- please add their house-made bbq sauce, it really adds to the flavour

6) Cornbread $4.90
- probably the best cornbread I have had (I am not a cornbread expert lol)

7) Buttermilk Fried Chicken
- WOW! Crispy on the outside, moist in the inside
- This was by far, my favourite of all the things ordered

Review 5/5:
- Food: my 6 friends and I genuinely enjoyed all the food we ordered.By the end of it, we realized we ordered a lot of food even though we were all starving and had light lunches to prepare for this haha
- Environment: 2 floors, good for big groups, dark, not too noisy, so you can have a conversation with friends (we were seated upstairs)
- Service: Food came pretty quickly, waitress was very attentive and sweet even though some of us changed our minds a few times. She did a wonderful job recommending things to have on the menu 

Would I come here again?
- YES, YES, YES - food was delicious, but be warned, you should share with others

Helpful tips:
- Address: 869 Queen Street W (501 queen streetcar, 2 stops after and/or before Bathurst depending on if you are heading west or east)
- Order: Buttermilk fried chicken, pulled pork mac n' cheese, cornbread
- Methods of Payment: Cash, debit, credit card (DOES NOT ACCEPT AMEX)
- Non-meat Options: Beet Salad, grilled corn, potato salad, baked beans, coleslaw"}
{"text":"I went there because of the good reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, the food was very far from good. 
We had baby back ribs that where really chewy and I would not expect that from a place that specializes in BBQ. 
We also had a side of mac and cheese.. didn't taste the cheese it seemed like they mixed pasta with salad dressing.
The potato salad.. I can't even describe how horrible it was and I mean, how difficult is it to make a potato salad?!
Swiss chalet has better ribs than this place."}
{"text":"Staff are super nice. The place is cozy and cool. The meat was juicy and tender.
Overall food quality, service and staff are very good.
The only con is, we were seated towards the very end, and there was this terrible smell coming from the kitchen or .... and it made us loose our appetite. Luckily, we asked them to move us elsewhere and since we didn't have reservations, we were asked to leave soon, but that bad smell stayed with me and didn't allow me to enjoy the amazingly BBQed meat. Make sure to make a reservation as the place is not huge."}
{"text":"Love this little neighbourhood BBQ joint. Hands down the BEST BBQ chicken you will ever eat. $15 gets you a large portion of tender, juicy, meaty, crispy skin and simply phenomenal tasting saucy chicken. Good to the last morsel. Perfectly battered and crunchy onion rings are pumped out like factory line, along with thin crispy shoestring fries - my fave. The cornbread and honey butter are a must have as well, as well as the Brussels sprouts which are cooked to perfection, sautéed brown and charred outside smothered in a sweet and savoury balsamic glaze. My bf and I have been twice to Smoque now and each time have received warm, courteous and good service from both management and servers. Highly recommend sitting at the bar so you can get a view of the kitchen action. And Ps. Have been to other places in TO in search of BBQ like Barque, Rose n sons, etc...but they don't come close!"}
{"text":"it's a bit cramped, imo. not that easy to go to with kids. it's a little pricey. i'm not a big eater and i paid quite a bit to get full. service isn't fast, but it's decent.

nevertheless, everything on the menu is amazing! imo, it's better than 420 and carbon bar. actually, it's as good as any smokehouse in texas i've ever been too and that's pretty much the best compliment i can give.

just food: 5/5.  overall: 4/5."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say (except for stools which weren't the most comfortable) BUT totally worth going here because of the: Best bbq sauce, best tasting bun, best coleslaw and delicious pulled chicken.  Service was quick.  Beef Brisket was also very good.  We shared an order of fries and were full but not stuffed which was great since we had to return back to the office.  Fries were nice, fresh and thin and tasty.  

We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"The ribs and brisket were great.  The sides are a on the small size, but also very delicious.  We sat at the bar and had amazing service.  The staff were overwhelmed but made sure we were acknowledged.  
Fun joint, check it out."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I shared the Sampler tonight - 1/2 rack of ribs, 1/2 chicken, 1/4lb brisket, cornbread, buttermilk onion rings, and coleslaw. The meat was exceptional - smokey, flavourful, very tender - and though we enjoyed it all, we both liked the brisket most for its overall texture and taste. The sides were also delicious, but what stood out the most for us was the coleslaw - creamy, tangy and seasoned with dill for a unique and really pleasant dish.

The service was good - our reserved table was ready when we got there, drinks and dinner ordered within 10 minutes of arriving, plates out 5 minutes after that. The restaurant is small and cramped though, and on a busy Saturday night that made the experience a little less than ideal. We were seated near the door, so there was a draft every time people came into the restaurant. People waiting for tables or takeout were standing right beside our table which was a bit uncomfortable. Definitely wouldn't want to sit there again.

TLDR; great food, small restaurant, would go back"}
{"text":"Went here with really high hopes based on the reviews on Yelp and it was good but I found everything fairly overpriced. Had the spicy caesar which was advertised as the drink special of the day. I had read that on their online menu that it came in a mason jar and was garnished with pickled veggies but when I got it, it was in a tiny glass garnished with only a lime wedge...guess that's what makes it \"special\". We opted for the sampler for two for $50. It was good but again quite overpriced...the sides were tiny, the brisket and peppercorn beef consisted of only a few thin slices each, however the onion rings were amazing. We left still feeling a little hungry and not quite satisfied."}
{"text":"3.5 but rounding up for the great service and vibe. 

Hip and casual place to go eat on queen st. Thursday night and got the sampler for 2: choice of 3 meats and 3 sides. $45 got the pulled pork, ribs and sausage. Meats were good although a bit dry. Sides chosen were potato salad, coleslaw and sweet potato waffle fries. The first two didn't have that much flavour but when you pair it off with the meat, pretty good! The waffle fries were the best part of the night. Make sure to order it!

The price is pretty steep for the amount of food. So I probably wouldn't order the same thing next time but I'd love to try their Mac n cheese! Perhaps next time..."}
{"text":"They don't have the same level of quality with their delivery as I remember them having in the restaurant. With both Foodora and Door Dash I've had problems. 

There was some kinda dental floss-looking stuff in my ribs, and my ribs were all super small. I think they picked all the smallest ones to ship out for delivery to save the big ones for the people in the restaurant. Barely any meat at all. 

A while back I ordered from them and the the delivery guy told me the owner/manager/whoever said \"why should I make delivery when I have people in the restaurant?\" The delivery guy was freaking out calling me like \"they aren't going to make your order.\" They eventually did but it took longer and there was this dramatic episode with the courier calling me. It's kind of annoying that I had to wait the extra time while they figured out if I was gonna get my food or not. If you don't want to do delivery/takeout then don't be on all the delivery apps. Duh. 

They have high turnover of their wait staff. I used to eat there when I worked nearby. Never the same wait staff. I'm guessing it's not just delivery couriers and customers that get treated poorly. Just speculating though. 

Even if the restaurant is empty at lunch time/early afternoon, the wait staff pretty much refused to sit 2 people at a larger table and insisted on giving us the ledge. We were literally the only people in the restaurant and there were plenty of tables available for larger groups so I thought that was weird.

I only kept ordering from them because Barque isn't on the apps anymore and they're the first ones that come to mind for BBQ other than them, but I'll be looking elsewhere for BBQ delivery. You basically gotta watch them make and plate your order otherwise the QA is way down and you'll have takeout containers full of the smallest ribs, dental floss (plastic string of some sort), and scrapings from the bottom of the pan when you order the Brussels sprouts. 

They even stopped giving BBQ sauce out with their ribs for delivery. My tiny bony ribs arrived meatless and dry and without BBQ sauce. Great, so appetizing...

You can tell they ship out the scraps for delivery. Delivery app customers are second class citizens to these guys, and they voice that opinion to their couriers. I don't appreciate that, considering it's pretty expensive for a rack of ribs and a couple of sides.

TTYLBBQ place"}
{"text":"Was in the area yesterday around 5ish so dropped by as I was starving. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was very good. I also ordered their house lemonade. It was ok. Not too sweet which is great but I can make better at home. Also their pecan pie was a pecan tart (round) and the crust was a little hard. The desserts are not made in house. Sides are not included and cost extra.

I will definitely go back to try their ribs and cocktails."}
{"text":"I don't enjoy giving my review of a restaurant when traveling. Taste is relative. Smoque N' Bones may in fact be a good BBQ joint here in Toronto.  I've had BBQ in Texas, Kansas City, North & South Carolina, as well as other places and this was some of the worst I've ever had. It also didn't help that the hard rock music was way too loud, there was only one server, which meant service was slow and they were out of coleslaw.  I had the beans made with brisket, collared greens with ham hock and roasted corn on the cob. I enjoyed the flavor of the corn, although it was cooked to long. Maybe that's how it's cooked in Toronto. The beans were just ok and I did not like the flavor of the greens at all"}
{"text":"Low key BBQ spot that can definitely throw down and hold its own! Been here a handful of times and food is always consistent. Pork ribs are smokey, and tender.. without too much sauce. You a sauce type? No problems! It comes with a side of sauce and a paint brush just in case. Brisket and beef ribs are equally good, but their sides could use a bit of help. I'd like to see a little more southern flare like fried okra, or hush puppies but can't ask for everything. Drink program is decent too. Try an in-house Old Fashion while you're there!"}
{"text":"I make A LOT of BBQ. I take it seriously.  I study it. I keep trying BBQ joints and inevitably say \"I prefer mine\". Tonight my reaction was \"I will gladly pay for this\"

We were a group of 8. Some had the various sandwiches, but we also shared 2 platters, so we sampled all of their BBQ meat options. The brisket and pulled pork were slightly overdone for my liking, but remained moist and tender. The peppered beef was outstanding, and the ribs were among the best restaurant ribs I've had. I was not disappointed by the chicken or sausage. The cornbread was outstanding, coleslaw was fantastic (perfectly dressed and not over seasoned) and the collard greens were tasty. The topper though, was the onion rings. Out of this world!

The servers were very attentive and deserve props for dealing with a group this size in a place not set up for groups this size. 

Can't wait to go back once they open the bar on the upper level!"}
{"text":"went to this place because i was craving bbq and because it was close to my place. great service, the staff was really friendly and knowledgable. i had thr spiked lemonade and it was refreshing! it came in a mason jar with 1.5oz of alcohol so it hit the spot. i had the 1/4 of spicy sausage which was delicious - it came with carmelized onions and dijon mustard + bbq as dipping sauce - enough as an appetizer for two people. i also had the riblets which in my opion was a bit dry. the portion was big also, enoigh to share as appetizer or as a main. i got collard greens for a side and that was delicious. my friend got a beet salaf and it was really small (the same size as my collard greens) for double the price."}
{"text":"Everything was yummy, not just the BBQ but from the simplest mac n cheese, shoestring fries and onion rings 
Sampler for two is more than enough food and well worth it! 
If you're a bourbon or whiskey fan they have a great selection and their old fashioned were well made, one of the best I've had! Nothing bad to say at all about this BBQ joint"}
{"text":"Food was excellent. I shared a half-rack of ribs and 1 side of brussel sprouts with a friend. Ribs were amazing as were the sprouts. My table sampled lots and no one was disappointed with the delicious food. 

Prices were too high though, If I had had a larger appetite I could have easily spent $30-$40 just to get a decent sized meal. I would compare it to Barque and say the food is as delicious but you spend more. They had a sample platter meal for 2 people, $50, and when I counted up the items it wasn't even saving you any money then buying all the items individually. 

Place is small so make a reservation."}
{"text":"I'm sure when I update my review it will be a 5 stars! The 4 stars is to account for the growing pains (open for a week?) they are experiencing which meant waiting awhile for food and drinks.

The space is a modern meets traditional BBQ joint. Lots of wood pieces and rustic lighting fixtures. The black ceilings make it just a bit too dark of a space for me. I like lots of light! 

For now, the menu is very limited while the restaurant works out their recipes. We ordered the sweet tea, Caesar, 1/4 rack of ribs, pulled pork sandwich, fries and collard greens. We got a small plate of potato chips, so good!

As mentioned, the drinks took a long time come. Our drinks, including water, came out in cute mason jars that were kind of kitschy but adorable at the same time. My sweet tea was okay, more on the sweet side than the tea side. The Caeser was perfect. We are not Caesar people but it was just phenomenally spicy and flavourful. I think a pickled green bean, in place of some of the pickled jalapenos, would take it over the top!

The ribs were divine! The smokey flavour was present but not overpowering. I love the small touches like putting the BBQ sauce on the side with a brush. The meat was tender, juicy and fall of the bone but still with a bit of chew. The pulled pork was also smokey, but I didn't get a taste of it. I ordered the collard greens to try it for the first time, wasn't a big fan. The fries however were fantastic, so crispy yet still remained a bit fleshy. I would stop by just to get an order of the fries! Unfortunately, the man gobbled them up before I got around to have some more of them.

Altogether, a great experience and can't wait to come back. I really want some cornbread next time!

Forgot to mention, the head chef/owner? is really communicative with his guests. He was eager to know how we liked everything and if we had any feedback. I did mention the ribs were a little too salty, but I am sensitive to salt."}
{"text":"I love this place! So far I've tried all of the sandwiches and the pulled pork is my favourite followed by the pulled chicken, beef brisket, and peppercorn beef being my least favourite. I also love their sweet potato waffle fries. My bf got some sort of rib from them last time and that was delicious too."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to eating here for some time. My cousin and I ordered the sampler for 2 and had no complaints! The ribs were tender and fall off the bone with a great texture and wonderful char. The other noteworthy item was the mac and cheese. The 4 year old white cheddar provided a velvety smooth texture I haven't had in years.

Ambiance and service were excellent.

4 stars indeed!"}
{"text":"I had SUPER high expectations for this joint and I really wanted to like it more than I did. I have been eyeing the menu for a while and finally decided to place a take out order since I am a 1 minute walk away. I ordered the pulled pork mac and cheese, the maple marinated wings, and waffle cut sweet potato fries. 
When I went to pick up, I still had to wait a couple minutes, which was totally fine because I got to see them prepare the food in front of me. The ribs looked really good, presentation of food was on point. And I guess thats why I was EVEN MORE excited to dig in.
Got back to my desk with the food - again, literally a 1 minute walk away - and was pretty underwhelmed. 
Sweet potato fries were SUPER soggy (not sure if it was due to the containers they used) but absolutely zero crisp/crunch to it. Although, it was seasoned very well (yay! 1 star for that lol)
Pulled pork mac and cheese was decent. No real complaints except the fact that the pulled pork didnt taste really fresh (2 additional stars for that)
Maple Marinated Wings - The biggest disappointment. Kinda wanna ask \"ummm marinated where? marinated how?\" I imagined a nice maple smoke with a tasty glaze. And was presented with a few overly salty. dry (DRY inside and outside) and below average wings. I didnt get the veggie sticks either to cut the salt factor. I've probably had better wings at 7/11 lol. Maybe it just wasnt a good day for wings when I stopped by :( (-1 star) 
Overall I was pretty disappointed and not in any rush to go back... Looking forward to trying other spots along Queen St."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening with a group of 4 people around 9:50 p.m. Once arriving we were  not greeted by any of the staff and we were so confused as to what we should do.  Do we seat ourselves or do we wait for someone to seat us?  The men behind the bar kept looking at us weirdly but they did not greet us either.  10 minutes later, a waitress comes up to me and says they are no longer taking any more customers, with no explanation......what? Don't they close at midnight on a Saturday?! It didn't look that busy either and saw a couple tables that were available.....

How unfortunate, was really looking forward to trying this place with my friends buuuut I don't think I'll be coming back here.  Thanks but no thanks Smoque N' Bones!"}
{"text":"Good food. Slow but friendly service.
Aside from the fries, this is pre-cooked, so shouldn't take 33 minutes to get my food."}
{"text":"Had a great feast at this place last week. They could use some more seating but other that that I left impressed and it will definately become a go-to spot for me.
We started off with the chicken wings and rib tips - both were excellent. As a big fan of wings, I have been searching for a decent place in the King/Queen West area for years and I think I have finally found what I have been looking for.
Then came the platter for two. Both the ribs and brisket were outstanding, however I found the sausage to have a weird texture. The beans, fries and rings were all pretty good as well.
I am not sure how this place stacks up against the other popular BBQ joints, but I thought the food, presentation and service were all top notch and I am stoked to go back."}
{"text":"Our meal of smoked BBQ ribs, smoked brisket, and a few sides (house pickled veg, collard greens, popcorn shrimp) was totally scrumptious. The ribs have so much meat on them, and are one of the smokiest tasting rib dishes I've ever had the pleasure of stuffing into my mouth (but I'm not a BBQ expert by any means). The brisket is tender, flavourful, and has generous fat on them (which i normally don't go for, but in this case it was worth it... flavour country). My feeling is that downtown TO is lucky to have a bbq joint like this open up... great vibe (roadhouse style), too."}
{"text":"Beer deals were good, 25$ for 5 corona. We ordered tasting menu, brisket was coldish, but delicious. Pulled pork was not good. Ribs were very good. Chicken no. Probably wont go again."}
{"text":"Today we ordered takeout for the first time through foodora. The delivery time estimated up to 45 minutes. We ordered the pulled chicken sandwich, beef brisket, and two chicken mac & cheese bowls and 4 drinks. After an hour and a half our food had arrived. We did not it expect to take double the wait time but we still gave the benefit of the doubt. They messed up our order, adding coleslaw to the chicken which was requested not to be added, and not added to the brisket. We also did not receive  two of our pops. We called to let the management know of the mishap and correct our order, however we were told management was busy they'd email us back. 
Later on we received and email from foodora  refunding our pops and offering a free sandwich and delivery.  

Food was 3.5/5
Service 1/5 

We did appreciate the offer, however we probably not be back after this poor experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite bar and grill. I even come here alone on a random day.

The environment is nice. Food comes pretty slow, though, but they guarantee good quality of food and services. Nice servers. Plenty choices of food on the menu that would make me want to come again and again.

I like their sweet potato waffles, it served real hot and not too soggy. I like their baby back ribs too. So Flavorful and yet not too salty."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet or heard of this place, your life is about to change.

After I had a few bites of the ribs we had ordered, I looked to my girlfriend and asked her why we hadn't visited this place earlier. For a moment, I was sincerely upset about the idea that I have been missing out on the deliciousness they have to offer.

We ate as if we were two polar bears who just woke up from hibernation and our order was completely unnecessary but totally worth it because after we got hungry later on that night, we polished the leftovers. Were we upset that the food was over? Yes.

A few days had passed and we were craving this place so badly that three days later, we had to foodora some more in.

You have to understand that the food here has a certain distinct flavour that you don't find at most places. It's the father of BBQ places in Toronto and possibly the world. I have been around. I've never eaten anything like the full rack of ribs that I shamelessly smothered in BBQ Sauce. I could have rubbed that sauce on my face, body and as disgusting as it may sound, you'll understand once you try it. It gets you really riled up.

The onion rings were magical and the cornbread was phenomenal. The mac n cheese was legendary and so was the chicken. You are going there for the ribs though. 

After eating the meat here, you're going to feel like a stallion if you know what I mean.

I usually like to have a few beers when I am eating red meat. It's just my thing. It's what I like to do but I didn't touch my glass because the food was so damn good.

Know that you need to order a few sides in addition to your main course because if you don't, something is wrong with you and you're not taking advantage of the experience so don't be a silly goose.

The staff was really helpful so just ask them what they dig and they will show you the way.

Enjoy people."}
{"text":"Fantástico smokehouse, el sitio perece la pena sin duda  y no esta mal de precio. No dejes de probar los aros de cebolla y por supuesto las carnes ahumadas."}
{"text":"The British bartender Jenna is one of the coolest people I ever met. GREAT service and people"}
{"text":"To satisfy my sudden craving for barbeque meat we chose this restaurant after some recommendations from friends.
This place is not for vegetarians, unless they are ok with eating only sides.
Ambience:
I loved the layout, whereby the table faced the grill where the chef would grill the meat right in front of you. 
Service:
We were immediately seated by a friendly server whom was very polite and attentive.
The chef would also make short conversations with the customers, which made the dining experience more personal.
I also liked that I could see my food being grilled fresh by the chef.
Food:
I got the 1/2 chicken with the sugar glazed bbq sauce + a side of pickled vegetables.
My meal was AMAZING!! I literally scraped every bit of meat left on the bone and the bbq sauce was exceptional.
My brother got the sausage + a side of coleslaw. 
According to him it was amazing too. He also ordered the sweet tea, which was a refreshing lemony ice tea. I tried some of it and would definitely recommend it.
Bonus:
Once we were done and waiting for the bill we watched as the chef was frying up some chicken. Once cooked he chopped it into pieces and handed us a piece, claiming that it's a new recipe they're releasing soon on the menu. We really appreciated that gesture but additionally, that fried chicken made KFC and Popeyes chicken seem pathetic. They used a buttermilk coating, which really enhanced the flavour and did not hold on to all the grease.
Definitely a must-try.
Price:
A bit on the pricey side, but worth it for the portion size and taste.
There is no doubt that I will be visiting this place again, but the next time will build-up the appetite to order their buttery corn bread, which I had a very strong temptation for."}
{"text":"As an experienced BBQ fan I had to try this place based on the recommendation of a friend. The portions vary in size and quality. Chicken and ribs were ample and tasty, brisket and pepper steak were puny. My favourite side was the unique Brussel sprouts. A must try !
Service was friendly and the space is great. There should be more emphasis on unique sauces and the overall price value is a tad steep."}
{"text":"Smoque N Bones is a little hole-in-the-wall type restaurant, that if you're not looking close enough you might miss it - but be sure not to! its a great place to eat - just be sure to make a reservation.  They turn away TONS of people because they're fully booked, as it is pretty small.  It's not their fault, they are really popular and their food quenches that BBQ craving you have. 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get the corn! It's phenomenal. You can thank me later. 

A few cons (personal experience):
* The stools at the bar at not that comfortable (I'm fairly short, and felt I had to lean on the counter a lot) so I always try to ask for a table. 
* sometimes I decide on a whim to go for BBQ, but know that their walk-ins can't be accommodated often (so I always try to make reservations ASAP - like days before)

Other than that, can't complain! 

I usually have the sampler, and share it, and think it's a great size.  Always a good place to go, always delicious, service is great."}
{"text":"Came all the way from home, which was pretty far and they were closed during stated working hours. Shame!"}
{"text":"Being pretty loyal to my local BBQ joint on Roncy I hesitantly checked this place out based on reccommendations.  What great flavours! Brisket craving filled with on the thinner sliced pieces, dripping with melted juiciness from the cook and the chicken was incredibly juicy and flavourfull.  Brussel sprouts were like veggie candy and collard greens we're very tender..not too salty and delish.  Pulled pork was well seasoned and not oversauced which I appreciate.  

The best thing might gave been the onion rings though, I'd go back just for those.  Baked beans are on the Al dente side , so if that's not your thing...reconsider with something else.  Like the menu and options...need to go back and try out the rest of the menu.  Found prices a bit higher than some other BBQ joints but flavours and textures really delivered."}
{"text":"Warning, Smoque N'Bones is not the friendliest place for vegetarians. Chef Alex started his culinary journey at the age of 16. He opened Smoque N'Bones because of the freedom offered by Southern-style food. The boundless style of Southern-cooking allows him to exercise his culinary creativity! 

My brother and I shared Chef Alex's pulled pork sandwiches ($9.50) and pulled-chicken sandwiches ($9.50). The buns were brushed with garlic butter then grilled to perfection.  The creamy coleslaw adds an additional layer of flavour to each sandwich. The smoky barbeque sauce was oozing out from the bun. It was the perfect messy bite. 

My favourite are the out-of-the-world buttermilk onion rings ($5.90). The onion rings were covered with savory spices and severed with a side of chipotle mayo! It was the best and the most addictive onion rings I have ever had. I am salivating just thinking these delicious onion rings. 

Last but not least, my brother's favorite, beef brisket ($16.90 for  1/2 lb). The beef briskets were served with a side of pickled cabbage and extra barbeque sauce. The smokiness of the barbeque sauce plays off the acidity of the cabbage and the savouriness of the juicy beef brisket

Smoque N'Bones had sent my joy molecules are definitely off the charts."}
{"text":"Came here with my team as part of our quarterly outing and we were not disappointed! We were in the upstairs section of the restaurant where it was more spacious so it's actually great for large groups. We ordered pretty much everything off of the menu and everything was delicious. There wasn't a single dish that I was unsatisfied with. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I've had Texan bbq before and this place is just as good, maybe even better... 

Cons: we were told our wait would only be 20 minutes but it took 45.. They only have 4 tables, one of which only seats 2 people.. And if you don't make a reservation, you won't be sitting at a table.. Instead you'll be sitting at the bar.. Awkward when you're there with 5 people.. You can't talk to everyone or share food easily.. They also made us move down the bar a few times to accommodate more people.. Kinda disrupting.. We got the Mac and cheese which in all of our opinions, was not good.. It was bland and not very cheesy at all

Pros: aside from not being able to talk to my friends at the bar, it's not a bad seat cuz you get to see all the action cuz they're cooking and cutting up the food right in front of you.. They gave us complimentary baked beans which were amazing.. Smokey and porky and sweet... We ended up getting the sampler... We got the cornbread which was so good.. They were moist and dense and they came with this buttery cinnamony apple butter which I could eat with just a spoon.. The french fries were really good.. They weren't your typical fries, they were shoestring, but fried perfectly.. But the best side dish we got were the buttermilk fried onion rings.. You saw them make it fresh from the time that they actually cut it up, to the time that the batter it and fry it right before your eyes.. I don't know why they were so good but OMG they were just amazing.. For the meats, we got ribs, which you could taste the smoke.. It was to die for.. The presentation was really cute because they give you paint brushes to put the barbecue sauce on.. We got the pulled pork, which were pretty good.. They were done right and they were very soft and juicy.. We got the sausage, which are okay.. Nothing too great but it was pretty good I guess.. But the number one best thing that we got there was the beef brisket.. OMG.. when they give it to you, it doesn't look like a big portion, but two servings of it filled the five of us pretty well.. They were marbled perfectly, with just about the right amount of fat.. And they're so juicy, that you don't even need the barbecue sauce.. It actually felt kind of wrong to ruin the flavor of the brisket with barbecue sauce..because they moved us around so much, they gave us free dessert.. It was pecan pie.. It was not as sweet as most pecan pies were, which in my opinion, was really good

I definitely go back very soon.. I wouldn't be surprised if I came back every week.. The owner, at least who I think is the owner, was a really sweet guy and very personable and interactive with the guests, without being intrusive or annoying"}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here and it kind of ended up being a dud.  Service was extremely slow, they forgot a lot of our food and we basically had to go get the bartender because they forgot about us.  Usually a pretty understanding group as we are all in the industry, but it was pretty lowsy regardless.  Our drinks were nothing to write home about.  I had the Hickory Smoked Lemonade with Bourbon.  The lemonade tasted like bar lime, I don't know how, but it did.  It's super easy to make lemonade so I'm still pretty baffled at that.  The food was mediocre.  Tasted decent but it came out cold.  I feel like the whole experience of getting BBQ would be for it to be \"hot off the grill\" not room temperature.  I probably will not be returning."}
{"text":"Best EVER. Everything was to die for. Beats some famous joints in southern US states! Can't wait to return for the rest of the food and drink menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Smoque N' Bones a couple times and also got take-out. I have never been disappointed. The ribs are amazing, and there is a wide variety of sides! It's a great addition to Queen West and I am really looking forward to their new menu items."}
{"text":"I am always on the look out for good BBQ places especially ribs, sometimes a girl just can't wait for the yearly ribfest to come around. Up until now, I have only found 2 places that I love, Sockyard (post here & here) and Barque (post here & here).

Smoque N Bones (@SmoqueNBones) opened back in May and it immediately went to the top of my list and it didn't disappoint. They do not take reservation, so I only dared to go there on a late Saturday lunch. Being just across Trinity Bellwoods Park, we could easily get take out and eat at the park if it was full.

The space is pretty small but love the use of the long narrow space w/ the open kitchen on one side and bar seating on the other.

 Spicy Smoquin Caesar
~ The cocktail packed quite a bit of heat, loved it but they have to work on the spice rim since it was stucked hard.

 Pickled Jar $3.90
~ Okra, Jalapeno, Chow Chow, Mixed Veg
~ Love the presentation! Never had pickled okra before which was less slimy than I expectected.

Pork Side Ribs $16.90 for 1/2 rack
~ It's not the super soft fall off the bone type of ribs, it has a bite to it with a slight charred outer layer and still manage to be fall off the bone good. 
~ Smoked for 4 hours, it was tasty even on it's own and love how the sauce was on the side to be slather on at your own preference.

Beef Brisket Sandwich w/ Braised Cabbage $11.90
~ Love this fatty saucy goodness, perfect with the added pop of color, flavor and texture of the cabbage. 
~ Love how there was the perfect amount of sauce and the bun hold up everything just right.

Sweet Potato Waffle $5.90
~ Love these, can't stop munching on them. 
~ It was just like fires but somehow the texture here are better. 
~ Just soft enough on the inside and just crispy enough outside.

Baked Beans $3.90
~ It was a bit sweet for me, wish it has a bit of spice to it.

Verdict :
~ Love the ribs, so definitely will be back for more
~ Heard they will have smoked wings soon, so have to be back for that
~ Love their service, their social media, the space and the whole vibe of the place"}
{"text":"Decided to play it safe and do BBQ after a horrible lunch. This place was a good pic.  It's a small place with a long area of bar seating. Which is actually wrapped around the grill and food prep area. If you can move past them not wearing gloves, you'll probably enjoy your meal. We ordered a variety of menu items including a rack of ribs, grilled corn, pulled pork, grilled Brussel sprouts, onion rings, sweet potato waffle fries, and shoestring fries. All were good. The Brussel Sprouts  deserve a second mention from me, and the Grilled Corn my husband said deserved the same. Although the waitress acted as if they were too busy to bring a Bourbon menu (which she eventually did bring), and for the bartender to fix me a drink that wasn't on their short menu of Specialty Cocktails (I only wanted a margarita) because they were supposed to be having a party upstairs that was keeping him way too busy. Mind you, he was not, as he was wondering around after he got bored, asking if people needed take out boxes, and picking up random used dishes. Yes, I was a bit bitter about it, but I won't take it out on the rest of the place. The food is deserving of a good review.  It's a bit on the pricey, but worth a few extra pennies for a cool, laid back atmosphere and pretty good eats."}
{"text":"PROS
- the pulled pork mac n cheese is excellent
- the baby back ribs are very good - thick and tasty

CONS
- it would be nice if they offered the half rack option for all their ribs - a full rack of ribs is too much for two people but the baby back ribs only come as a full rack
- the bar seating area is too dark

I'm going to rant a bit here. If I remember correctly, their little card machine has four tipping options: 18%, 20%, 21%, and \"choose a percentage.\" First of all, the standard tipping percentage is FIFTEEN percent. This place is a CASUAL rib joint with less-than-desirable bar seating - not a high-end restaurant like Scaramouche - so I think it's rather pompous of the Smoke N Bones folks to think that they're entitled to higher-than-average tips and not even offer 15% as a pre-selected option.

And I typically tip 15% on the PRE-TAX amount of the bill. Am I the only person that finds it absolutely ridiculous to tip on tax??"}
{"text":"We ordered the half rack of pork ribs and the sweet potato waffle fries. Both tasted amazing. It was also very filling between 2 people. I want to come back and try the beef brisket!

The atmosphere was what you'd expect in a smokehouse. They repurpose old liquor bottles as water jugs! We could also see the chef smoking and brushing the ribs, which was really cool! Service was really quick as well."}
{"text":"3.5 here because the pulled pork and ribs we had were ok but I've had better. The ribs tasted good but it was dry. Pulled pork was ok wished we had tons more sauce. The sauce was ok but not that good. The mac and cheese was pretty good. The cornbread was ok but the butter that came with it was excellent! Service was so so and it's small so if you come late you'll have to wait. Glad I tried but indifferent about coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here four times before and their ribs and ribs only are delicious. Must say the service today was horrible and rude and what you would expect from a bunch of underpaid hipster people. Actually was here to bring home 10 racks for a birthday tomorrow but I'm so shocked at the absolute lack of customer appreciation and service I got straight out of there. Please go if you'd life to be treated as if your money is worthless. Lame"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and we had the best experience!

I made a reservation in advance and they sat us at the bar. It seems meh but it was cool because we had this cozy little corner and there weren't that many people around us. We also had a full on view of the kitchen and bar so we knew our food was in good hands! 

We started off with a shot of bourbon because it's what they're known for. I'm not exactly a hard liquor person but we were celebrating a birthday! I asked our waiter to just bring us whatever her recommended, and preferably something good for a newbie. It went down smoothly and wasn't as terrible as I expected. Then my bf got his regular beer and I got a cesar. No complaints there!

We decided to go with the special for 2 where you get 3 meats and 3 apps. All I can say is we definitely were not left full!! Since it was the bf's bday I let him pick (most) things we got and had it been my birthday I probably would have picked different things but nonetheless everything was fantastic!!! For our meats we got the ribs, brisket and sausage. Each one came with a side sauce with a cute little paint brush so we could add however much we wanted. 

For the sides we got the brussels sprouts (my choice), the sweet potato waffle fries (mutual choice, my suggestion :P) and the mac and cheese (his choice). All were fantastic. I even had a small bite of the mac and cheese and I hate cheese and it was great! But oh my god those brussels sprouts were something else!!! I usually make my brussels sprouts at home pretty simple, so to eat them sauced up like that was a real treat! I've never tasted anything like it. I would literally return just for those!!! Everything was fantastic though, really, zero complaints. 

I will definitely be back...I'd love to try out the things we didn't, but I was pretty freaking satisfied with what we tried!!! The owner is also really nice he's a friend of a friend."}
{"text":"Me and my carnivorous chum got here at 7 on a Sat night and grabbed the last 2 seats at the bar.  Ordered the sampler platter for 2: Chicken, ribs, and pulled pork.

The 1/2 chicken was beautiful- you remember bbq's when you were a kid and Uncle Whats-his-face slightly overcooks the skin so it's crispy and tiny bit burnt?  It was like that.   The meat cooked to perfection, not dried out.

Ribs- good smoke ring, not too saucy, and right amount of chew.  Good stuff.

Pulled Pork- Good, but not mind blowing.  But pulled pork is damn hard, I get that.  Bonus they didn't rely on sauce to moisten it up but rather served it naked on it's own merits.

Sides- mac and cheese, collard greens, and potato salad, all great!

Drank lots of beer as is our RIGHT and walked out stuffed n' drunk.

Then went and drank WAAAAY more at another joint but that's another story!

D"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Delicious and BBQ. The chicken was soft and juicy. I loved the corn muffin w/ butter. We got the sampler for two and we can't even finished it. ( we packed to bring home ) It was a lot! And it was all darn good."}
{"text":"We went here last night with a group of 4. It has a nice vibe and you can smell the deliciousness of BBQ from the minute you walk in.

We did the platter for 2 which came with brisket, pulled pork and baby back ribs. The portions of meat were smaller than other BBQ places I've been to. We also got three sides which comes with the platter. We chose the Mac n cheese, Brussels sprouts and sweet potato waffle fries.

The ribs were pretty good. The meat was tender and flavourful. The brisket wasn't the greatest, would not get it again. And the pulled pork was really dry. The Brussels sprouts were pretty delicious but the Mac n cheese was severely bland. The waffle fries were good, but nothing special. 

The best part of the meal was definitely dessert. We ordered the pecan pie. It comes with vanilla ice cream and it was by far the best part of the whole meal. 

The food was decent, some good, some not so good. But nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Horrible service. This \"hurrier\" delivery service is so unnecessary. Our pork ribs were completely burnt and black. I don't know how anyone could pass those as edible and send them to a customer, absolutely disgusting and charcoaled. Complained and asked for another and they lied and said one was picked up 10 mins ago (after it was already two hours late). Instead just blamed it on hurrier and it never came. Pathetic and extremely disappointing for our first time trying out this place. Especially since the Mac n cheese was really good."}
{"text":"The pulled pork was great!  Smoky flavor, moist but not mushy...very good.  Sausage had great bite and snap, paired well with the house BBQ sauce.  Beef ribs were a bit tough, and the brisket was not \"Texas-style\".  Talking with Alex, he warned me about the brisket, and having to serve it sliced thin and with the grain to appease local tastes.  Brisket was moist and tender, but sliced thin as it was, it cooled quickly and didn't have a lot of smoke flavor.  Sides were awesome...beans were not sweet, but had a nice tang from the molasses.  I will be back, plenty on the menu to try.  Also, a really great bourbon selection and some nice craft beers on tap."}
