{"text":"My boyfriend & I were traveling through Pittsburgh and asked the concierge for a cool, but quiet bar ... for some reason she sent us to South Side.  The saving grace was The Brik Room, which had just (re)opened that day!

The bartenders were cool and although we got there just after the kitchen closed, the manager saw our hungry faces and took pity, making us the most amazing club sandwich ever.  Going above and beyond like that doesn't happen everywhere & it certainly didn't happen anywhere else in Pittsburgh for us that weekend, so they deserve major props.

We chatted with them and other customers and at the end of the day it felt like I'd spent the night at my local.  A kick-ass restaurant & bar with good food, drinks, and people.  Totally worth checking out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were making a short visit to my college roommate in Pittsburgh.  We had dinner at the Brik Room on Carson St. and it was fantastic.  The service was excellent, my husband and I truly enjoyed the crabcakes and my roommate claimed the pork chop was the best she had ever tasted.  I'm glad we spent our short visit to Pittsburgh at the Brik Room."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Food was average at best. When this restaurant was Mantini's, it was so much better. Food was amazing and service was always friendly. Food is now not good and service is rude, not helpful, and inattentive."}
