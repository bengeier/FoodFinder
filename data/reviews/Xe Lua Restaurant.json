{"text":"POOR SERVICE. been here since the grand opening years ago. Food and service just keeps going down the drain..ordered a vegetable dish, the mushrooms r all soggy and shit. Prob one of the worst pho restaurants in GTA. Asked the waitor for WiFi password and he said he forgot.."}
{"text":"Ew.  I grew up down the street and all I can say is ew. My friends would always come here to eat and I could never understand why. There aren't enough characters on yelp that could properly express all the bad stories I have about this place. From early in the day to night experiences, from people finding a bandages or tissue in their food to a friend of mine going into the kitchen himself to grab a pitcher of water for our table.   I also could never understand why a Vietnamese restaurant had servers who are Chinese and didn't know any Vietnamese. Seriously come on, what about Vietnamese tourists? This restaurant is a disgrace to Vietnamese food and culture.  Service Ew. Servers Ew. Food Ew. People Ew. Washrooms Ew.  Ew Ew Ew Ew Ew."}
{"text":"Worst customer service, even worst with their food! Ive been to almost all of the Asian restaurants in china town area and this restaurant has been my worst experience so far.  Ok on the food, they are not even the authentic Vietnamese food. They are all chinese. I ordered a chicken curry soup and it tasted like raw and not properly  cooked. Beside, i found a piece of chicken which was partly bitten off even before i touched it. Thats when i stopped eating, paid for the food and left the place ASAP. The service, pffs, all oof the waiters are with the most disrespectful attitude towards the customers. Most rude waiters around town. Personally, i will never go back to that restaurant again.  Theres an authentic small Vietnamese restaurant downstairs and their foods are way more delicious and offer best customer service."}
{"text":"Being a student from the high school across the street, I have eaten here a few times, and I had no problem with the food whatsoever.  I went back again last week for lunch and about an hour later, I threw up. Later on, I realized that I had food poisoning from the dish that I had. It couldn't have been anything else that I ate before because all I had before that was oatmeal for breakfast, which I have every morning. That day, I threw up 5 times, every time with a bit of the food that I had.  I will never again eat at this place ever. I probably got food poisoning from either uncleanliness and or improper food handling of raw meat."}
{"text":"yuuucck! this place is no good for pho! it's run by pure chinese people therefore it doesn't have the authentic vietnamese taste to it. this is the first place i have EVER went to that gave me thick rice noodles and it was disgusting! real vietnamese restaurants use the thin noodles which are definetly better because it doesn't make you full as fast and so that it looks more appetizing. this place used the wrong kind and it basically sucked up all the broth in my bowl and made it look like pieces of over-sized white things....(not appetizing at all!) the rare beef in my pho were sooo chewy like rubber and they were all stuck together as if it was frozen (not a good sign) whereas the broth had no taste at all which meant they didnt simmer the beef bones long enough... this restaurant is a NONO for me! quality of pho is sooo bad here."}
{"text":"One of the most popular pho restaurants for clubbing crowd, yes I was one of them. It's 3 am in the morning, you just danced for 3.5 hrs straight, where do you go? HERE. They don't judge you, they are just happy to server you yummy food. Need that extra calories? Just order the avocado shake...my personal favourite. I've followed this place before its renovation. Now is nice and fresh looking for first time customer. I love how you just write down what you want and they come and take the order away. No confusion at all!"}
{"text":"I initially had sentimental feelings about Xe Lua, because it was one of the first places Boyfriend and I went to dine together (hey man, we're poor students).  We've both decided now, that there is no reason for us to visit Xe Lua ever again.  The last time we came, we went before attending a show at Theatre Passe Muraille, but Boyfriend's food took so long that we had to leave before the food came! He ordered vermicelli...that's COLD noodles. I don't understand why it took 45+ minutes to prepare cold noodles with grilled chicken on placed on top of it. Don't they usually have a pile of cold noodles prepped? Isn't it just a matter of putting it in a bowl?  Location-wise, for us, it's not great, since we work at U of T. It's further than a few other pho places, and let's face it, my deadened Korean tastebuds can't really distinguish between the different restaurants anyway. May as well go to a closer establishment that serves the food while I'm still hungry."}
{"text":"Very bad service  I order shrimp the waiter gave me fish  Also order a noodle and came plain  Coz ran out of bbq pork and other ingredients  Aren't they suppose to inform customer  I won't go back anymore"}
{"text":"This is a nice pho place. Have been coming here for the past 20+ years. It always has a homey atmosphere and the food is already delicious. The food always comes out fast, so if you're ever extremely hungry, you know you'd be fed in quick time. This location would be one of my favorite Xe Lua places out of the franchise. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to eat at. The servers always look angry and bang plates on the table. My last experience there was horrifying. My friend and I had just eaten when we met with another friend who had just come from work and wanted to eat some pho. We were in the area and ended up going to this place. When my friend ordered a pho and an app and asked for an extra small bowl, the server gave us the dirtiest look. Came back with three small bowls (we asked for only one), then banged them on the table and proceeded to tell us that we are not allowed to order one pho and ask for bowls. Wtf? I was just horrified, had a chat with the manager who didn't seem to give a f-ck. All in all, this place is a nightmare. Not going back ever again! The pho is not even good, it is just average. Trust me, there are a lot of better pho places out there in the city. Skip this one!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was bigger than I expected after climbing up the flght of stairs.  The pho broth was a little watered down and bland.  The satay noodle was not very flavourful.  Over all not too memorable but the price was right...for the quality."}
{"text":"Our usual PHO place since it is right nice to RH station - perfect place to catch our dinner after picking up my hubby."}
{"text":"Like the food, but the service is slow and have been here twice and they were not even that busy on one of the occasion."}
{"text":"My go to pho place! Love their rice noodles with wontons!!   Pros: price, food, watching Chinatown from above   Cons: sometimes service is mixed (but eh? For this price I'm fine with paying at the front instead of waiting for the recipes and then waiting for the machine to pay)"}
{"text":"The price is decent and the place is nice and clean.  The food was ok.  I ordered a pork, chicken and rice dish (forgot what it was called).  It was tasty, and better than the pho here.  The pho was ok. It was alright but didn't taste amazing."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite places for Pho in Toronto! The rare beef pho is a classic dish, but the BEST thing on the menu is their Curry Beef Brisket Pho!! The curry broth is absolutely amazing and the amount of beef- let alone quality- will leave you drooling! You can tell the Beef brisket has been cooking for a while, not a single piece of bone or much fat at all- but you can pull the beef apart with your chopsticks!! The Chicken is also another good option to have with it! Of course, finish off the meal with their Vietnamese Coffee with condensed milk and its perfect!!!"}
{"text":"Service: -Fast; servers are very attentive and the food came out rather quickly  Food:   -Pho: They used fresh noodles (ho fun?), which ended up being a bit too soft. The broth didn't have much flavour and the meat was on the fatty side. -Deep Fried Squid Tentacles: came out kind of cold, and the batter was soggy..."}
{"text":"It was pretty good when we tried it last time.  But when we went back today, the soup wad not hot, noodles were overcooked and flat. Too bad we have no other pho restaurants in the area. Still I will think twice before returning to this one."}
{"text":"Xe Lua is one of my favorite chain restaurants for Pho. I was quite disappointed by the quality of the pho soup here. It has gone down the drain since the last time I was here. The soup taste like Chinese soup and not the authentic Vietnamese  soup of other Pho restaurants. If you are looking for authentic Pho you will find much better alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"This place was the first place I went to for pho years ago, and despite having graduated well beyond this small town's meagre pho offerings, for some reason I can never get enough of this place.  Right from the bat, yes this place serves their pho with thicker, flat rice noodles. Don't be ignorant enough to claim that this isn't pho. Their pho is more like the kind served in northern vietnam than the south. Their broth is also lighter and less complex in flavour than other places that serve the southern pho people are more used too. Their portions are absolutely massive and they don't skimp on meat. The largest size is over a pound of food and broth and will run you a little over $10. It used to be a much better deal before they raised their prices, but it's still very reasonable. My only complaints about it are that their noodles are sometimes clumped and the broth is noticeably oily on the top. That being said, none of that stops me from adding all the toppings, sriracha, hoisin, and slurping away (sometimes they don't give you chillis with your lime and basil, just ask for it).  I've never managed to convince myself to try any of their other dishes, but my meal companions have ordered rice/vermicelli dishes and been happy with them. Their spring rolls, imperial rolls, and meat skewers are also good. Also, try the avocado milkshake.  Don't expect anything from the service. I got to the point where the servers recognized me and my single corner table, large pho eating ways that it didn't bother me."}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends after work. The service was soo slow. Like they don't want to serve us. When we asked the server a question about a dish we order. The server barked his answer to us. Food was ok.  We left no tip.  Another time, I went to their Richmond Hill location. Drinks served in small styrofoam cups. We sat at a booth where the seat is damage. There is a large cut on the   seat.  Service was better."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto for a few days and thought I'd try out Vietnamese food here to see how it compares to NYC.  Incidentally, there is a Vietnamese restaurant in NYC by the same name and happens to be my favorite.  I ordered the extra large size bowl of pho tai with bo vien. When the soup arrived, it looked great but the noodles were oddly wide and thick, unlike real pho noodles which are thinner.  The broth was not good. It didn't taste like Vietnamese pho at all and I was very disappointed.  I wouldn't recommend this place for authentic Vietnamese cuisine."}
{"text":"Price was typical to other Vietnamese restaurants around $7-10 depending on what you order. The food however made us very thirsty and the service was average.  Came here on early Friday night with a friend. The parking lot is very small and there is no other parking lots nearby so be mindful that you may not be able to park. The restaurant was quite empty when we arrived, however it fulled very quickly. I ordered an ice coffee ($3.5) and a rice paper roll with vietnamese sausage ($6). Coffee and appetizer was flavourful, however as stated before, we were thirsty the entire name as the food was likely filled with msg.   Will not likely come back again."}
{"text":"The super-shiny decor and barely legal servers should have alerted me that there's \"TROUBLE AHEAD!\"  but I was fooled by the packed tables and the rumble in my tummy. The S.O. and I ordered spring rolls, pho tai for him, and bun with grilled shrimp and meatballs for me.   The S.O. got his pho right away then the sullen teen server brought out the spring rolls WITH my bun then disappeared. Okay, no bigs, we'll just eat our starter together with our mains. But it was obvious that everything had been pre-cooked then heated back up. Seriously, how fricking lazy are you that you can't be bothered to stick 4 spring rolls into a deep fat fryer or throw a shrimp on the barbie? If I wanted bad microwaved food I would've saved myself the trip and had Lean Cuisine at home.  The pho was meh and not worth the price of admission. To add insult to injury the nuoc cham dipping sauce was so sweet I felt a toothache coming on AND the pot of tea was tepid.  Don't expect to find your server when you need him because he's disappeared and probably gone to cut himself."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!  Xe Lua is a bit like a cafeteria for people who don't want to wait or pay much for food at strange hours. They serve decent pho and tasty soups, and everything is in the $6-10 range. The service is terrible, but your order will be taken and the food will arrive, and you shouldn't expect any more.  I like the fact that it's upstairs, because it creates a cleaner essence than other late night Spadina dives. However, I wouldn't bet that you can name everything that goes in the broth.  What can I say about this place: it serves up good stuff at good prices; it's always open; and there's always a seat. Another bonus - and forgive me if you're into political correctness - is that East Asian people do seem to frequent this place, which gives it an air of authenticity, even if it's superficial.  Have a soup, and enjoy those noodles. I can't recommend anything else.  2 stars"}
{"text":"The service was mediocre, but that wasn't my problem with the place. The owner, when my friends and I were paying (split bill) was trash talking us in Cantonese/some dialect similar to Cantonese (all 3 of us understand Chinese), and I start laughing uncontrollably at how fucked up that is (why because we're young girls? you do realize we speak the same language as you right?) and the owner switched up to another dialect (I still understood what he was saying). Never coming here again, incredibly disrespectful."}
{"text":"This place is one of the few places in town that is open till the morning hours after clubbing.  The pho noodle soup there is pretty good. I normally order a small which is quite filling. i attempt to ask for the thin noodles (to no avail as i'm not sure they speak much english there). To order, you tick off a piece of paper from the menu which is convenient - no small talk required.  The fruit slushy drinks are pretty refereshing - the jackfruit and mango are my favorites.  I heard from a friend recently that someone in China spiked the tapioca so for the time being, better order your drinks without the tapioca bubbles.  The food comes fairly quickly unless they are busy or forgot about your order.  Our drink orders have been recently forgotten for some reason until the end of our meal, even during days when they were not busy.  I don't typically order other menu items however my friends have ordered the rice curry, vermicelli dishes, and other various rice dishes.  Their spring rolls (the deep fried ones) taste ok. Often it comes drenched with a layer of grease. We get them free since my friend is a regular there.  The service there is typical of an asian restaurant. They will comply with your requests if you are able to flag them down or get their attention, which is often harder than you might think. Sometimes even when they are staring straight in your direction, they don't seem to notice you.  The ambiance is also typical of any asian resto. The floor is covered with a layer of grease.  They often play loud top 40 music in the background.  There are bright lights shining in your eyes from the ceiling. Sometimes this place is so rammed late at night with the after party crowd.  Overally, this is a good place for a quick bite after clubbing or if you want something at an adequate price point (below $7).  The drinks are around $3-$5. Because of the low pricepoint, i used to bring all my dates here. Mostly because many guys feel compelled to pick up the bill. I figured that even if we never went out again, nobody is going to be too upset if they are $6-$9 in the hole so to speak.  One time, the bill was $12 including tax an tip. So moral of the story, its not always good news when your date insists on taking you to this restaurant for a first date."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in the city. Tasty food, very reasonable prices and an extensive menu. The service is usually fast however during busy times you can expect to wait a bit longer."}
{"text":"Ughhh. Pho here is ok. Small portions. Broth is bland. Meat is ok. Only positive is that it is open 24/7. Go to place after partying I guess."}
{"text":"Choo Choo! because of the train picture on the sign....  Not the fanciest or classiest joint in town but where else can you fill your belly for under 10 bux! We visit the East Toronto Chinatown location because we know the owners and always get excellent, fast service. I've also eaten at the downtown Chinatown one but prefer the end end location. It's a good place to go for some late-night eats with a group of friends. I like the bun, many of my friends go for the pho. And, the avocado smoothies are made with real avocadoes.  Decent place."}
{"text":"They don't care much about their customers, food quality is inconsistent AND the place can be quite dirty. HOWEVER, this is my go-to place whenever I have night out in Downtown that involves a lot of drinking since my college years. I am always drawn back to this place, I guess it's mostly because they are open until very late and the price is pretty cheap.   I always debate between BBQ chicken dish and Pho whenever I come here, and good old classic Pho special is the winner most cases. If I end up ordering BBQ Chicken, I usually ask for a bowl of Pho broth.  If you find yourself wandering around the city late night, looking for a fix for your drunkenness, this is the place you should be."}
{"text":"Xe Lua, aka the Train is a great restaurant in Chinatown if your looking for something affordable, quick and the menu is quite extensive.    If I had to choose one dish that you must try here it is the chicken or pork on vermicelli noodles.  Their Pho is up to standard, but I don't think it is the best out there, not sure if there is such a thing.  There's probably about 4 decent Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown and I would have to say Xe Lua is the best overall based on, consistency of food, number of dishes and food quality."}
{"text":"A nice pho place,but the service may get improved better.I am a fan,at least it's authentic .will be back."}
{"text":"I waited an hour for my food here. Everyone that came after us got their food. When I asked where it was they said it was being made. Seriously. Changing my pervious 2 star rating to 1 star."}
{"text":"Another Vietnamese restaurant in chinatown.   Service: Absolutely horrible. They always rush you when you order. When you ask for more tea, a fork, etc. they usually forget and you'll have to ask multiple times for it. One thing that was really shocking was when we asked for the bill, the waiter brought it and stood right in front of our table holding the bill waiting for us to pay. First time I ever experienced service like that! I was like kind of shocked I must say.  Food: I usually only come here for Pho. They put a lot of random stuff and random pieces of meat in your pho. Not my favourite.  Cleanness: They are one of those restaurants that have all the chopsticks and spoons out. Kind of unsanitary since I've seen what people have done to them in the past. I always make sure I clean them with some tea before using them. Plus, I question about the bowls that are used for the pho. The sides of the bowl are extremely greasy and kind of gross.    I love pho, but I will not return back to this location."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on Friday... what can I say, not a fan... the decor was okay and i can overlook the disoriented teenage servers... but when i have to fight my noodles for the soup, you know the pho ain't any good.  i swear the noodles soaked up more of my soup than i did.  the pho just didn't cut it... pho hung down the street is better (which i probably should do a review for).  the spring rolls were okay.  it didn't look too appetizing as one looked like it was out of an alien movie where it exploded, but at least it tasted good. can't think of anything else nice to say about this place, i guess all i can say is i don't need a pho place at 2am, i need a pho place when i need it... in summary, this place sucks..."}
{"text":"Good - same as Pho Hung, Double 8 and Peach Garden."}
{"text":"While wandering around in Chinatown, we felt hungry and wanted to eat some soup. Vietnamese kitchen is always in our minds when we think of Asian food.   Not much to say about this place though: good service, nice inner décor, good food, all-in-all nice experience. Would recommend, mostly because of the kind server who happened to serve us.   It seems a big family run business, as we saw many women there with babies who where chilling by the cash counter."}
{"text":"This is where my bf and I turn to for our bun (vermicelli) cravings. Very very delicious and sooooo cheeeeap! LOVE IT.  As for their pho, it really depends. I've had more bad than good experiences with their pho. Sometimes it can be not bad, but it can be pretty bland sometimes.   Their rice noodle rolls are pretty good! As for other dishes, I've only tried two and they seemed just okay.  Still love to come here for their bun!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Viet food, there are tons of selections throughout the city but this one has always been a staple with downtowner's and people who want to grab something to eat after partying all night. Unfortunately for me, I am neither of those classifications so I don't frequent these types of restaurants as often.    BUT In truth, I actually feel fortunate that I don't have to go to these restaurants as often because Viet food has always been quite low on my food priority list because it makes me just go \"meh\". Some of you must be thinking \"Damn, did he just go there? Don't go there!\" ....well yes offence, I went there!  The simple reason I don't like this type of food is probably because I don't enjoy noodle soup as much so the one main staple of Viet food is already already a write off for me. I typically order the rice or vermicelli dishes.  So keeping those things in mind, here is my review:  Decor: After they renovated, I was quite impressed with the changes they made.  It's definitely more modern (kind of like Spring Rolls) and I appreciate that restaurants are starting to value dining ambiance.  BUT, there are some restaurants that should save their money on decor and spend it on maybe expanding their menu items or quality of food.   There are many successful Viet restaurants that have a crappy layout but if the food is right, then the product sells itself.  People don't come here for a romantic date I can attest to that.  But if the girl can appreciate that, she's a keeper?   Food: Like I said in the decor section, maybe they should have spent their money on the food quality instead.  The vermicelli bowl I got was COLD and the ingredients were not hot, just warm.   My friend ordered the Satay Sauce Noodles which I have to give props for though.  The sauce was thick which ensured that the sauce would not drip off the noodles easily so good job.   I also really wish that some restaurant could offer a 3 meat combo rice platter...Beef, chicken, and pork! That would be awesome and I would pay more for it.  Service: SLOW. Even to get our tea refilled.  My friend almost had to wear it like a hat for the waiters to see it.  Seriously, noodle soup should be quick.  Here's another scenario where money spent on the design of the restaurant could have been better spent on maybe more cooks?  I also acknowledge that this is a casual restaurant but as service staff, when you bring dishes over and announce the number or name of the dish, don't just put it in one area of the table and make the customers pass it around.  At least wait for someone at the table to raise their hand so you could at least gesturally pass it in their direction.  Again, money better spent on better service!   Overall: I'm sorry that I ripped this restaurant so hard. But from my other experiences at similar establishments, the service was better and the food was quicker and probably equivalent in taste. I got to keep it real and in my honest opinion, right?"}
{"text":"I only come here for pho and have not tried anything else on the menu. If you go early enough you can choose between fresh noodles or rehydrated noodles for pho! Broth is pretty good and you get a TONNE of pho for less than $10. My husband and I frequently come here after long cycling trips to carboload, and even though we are ravenous at those times neither me nor my hubby can finish the XL Pho (we get an XL Pho each). To put it into perspective, I can typically eat 2 bowls of large Pho at other Pho places such as Pho Hung under these conditions."}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: Pho prices are average.  The pho itself is only okay. Broth is a little watery (even for pho standards), but it is not terrible.  They DO give a LOT of ingredients (not stingy like other places).  So my tripe, tendon, flank pho had quite a bit of all three in the bowl. Other dishes are also decent but nothing exceptional.  Their shrimp rice rolls are made very well, and priced at $3.50 for two rolls (cut in half).   Facility: Located off Bayview Ave at Major Mackenzie, it is an absolute PAIN IN THE BUTT to get into this plaze if you are going northbound. You must do a U-turn to come back down to the plaza as the divider does not allow you to make a legal left hand turn into the parking lot. Decor is modern, clean and crisp.  Washrooms located down a long flight of stairs... are okay (could be better). I've never seen this location packed so although there doesn't look to me many parking spaces, I've never had trouble finding a spot.  Service: Service has always been great and the workers are kind.  The waiters are bilingual speaking Chinese and English fairly well. Food arrives quickly and employees are always working (cleaning or organizing).  I didn't see any workers \"loitering\".  Overall: Thought the food is only okay, having a typical price and good service is reason I will likely return to eat here if I am in the area. However, due to the awkward main road accessibility issue and the typical quality of food, I am not sure if I will seek out this location unless I am tired of Kim Po (or other convenient Pho restaurants closer to me)."}
{"text":"I've been here many many times, and every time it is amazing. For the pho they give you the choice of fresh noodles (which I always take) and you can tell it's made there because the noodles aren't always even widths -- but that's the kind of dedication I love about this place.  Another great thing here, their mango smoothies! Actually all their smoothies are good, but the mango one is the best.   Definitely recommend this place! The waiters are super sweet an friendly."}
{"text":"I used to live right by here, and would \"train\" all of the time. New train is better than Old train for anyone that remembers Xe ula pre-renovations.  Once at old Train I asked them to make me bun (vermicelli) vegetarian,  just noodles and veg no pork etc and they gave me Vietnamese pork sausage for my vegetarian meal, with a side of pork spring roll. At least Xe ula now has some options for non beef/pork/chicken eaters.   Bonus points: Hot tea Can accommodate Large Groups Open very late Shredded Tofu on the Bun Cheap and Clean Huge Menu, an entire section of vegetarian options.  Good Avocado Milkshakes Good Location  Negative: Clearly sometimes Quality Control has the day off. 'tude from the late night servers.  I really like the shredded tofu what can i say."}
{"text":"3 out of 4 pho were good but the pad thai with shrimp was bad. The fried tofu and eggs in the dish were charred/burnt which in turn made the entire noodles had a very strong burnt aroma."}
{"text":"I remember I had this at the other location, it was nothing near spectacular but edible.  Their pho is reasonably priced but lacking in quality.  Came this afternoon for a quick bite, had sugarcane shrimp and bun bo hue.  I don't expect them to make very authentic bun bo hue because many Vietnamese restaurants Toronto couldn't make authentic bun bo hue, but I do expect the quality to be at least average.  It was an disappointment as bun bo hue didn't come out hot.  It looked cold and lukewarm, and the broth was just not good.  It's so mild I can hardly taste any spice.  I also did not taste any shrimp paste and I think they use a little bit curry instead.  Sugarcane was fine but no dipping sauce at all?  Anyway, I've requested some dipping sauce and clearly they had forgot. Overall I think probably the experience would have been better had I ordered pho instead, at least they don't skimp on the ingredients. Overall, for me I find it hard to like this place.  They clearly don't know how to handle the service although the restaurant wasn't particularly busy, and they are not understaffed at all.  The food quality is also very mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Yeeps! What happened?   I came back to \"Train\" after a long hiatus (I was on pho overload), and was disappointed to see that service had gone from distracted to absent, cleanliness sat somewhere between tolerable and suspect, and food quality was altogether below average. Their #1 pho special which once brought me so much joy was made up of thick rice noodles and overly chewy beef slices, and came with the saddest plate of bean sprouts I'd ever seen. Are they trying to cut corners with their sprouts?  And so, old friend, it'll be a while before I come back here. I have other gastro-love affairs to tend to in the meantime."}
{"text":"Xe Lua Restaurant, or \"Pho Train,\" was a favourite place of mine to eat whenever I happened to be in Chinatown. When I was young, my parents often brought me to this restaurant. I can clearly remember the entire family enjoying delicious food and excellent service.   Sadly, that is not the case anymore.   I decided to bring a group of three friends (who were visiting the city for their first time ever) to my 'beloved' restaurant. Not only was the food mediocre (salty, lukewarm pho, drinks were half melted) at best, but my friends were appalled at the quality of service we received.   Yes, I do realize that the standards for service for this type of establishment should be low to begin with, but it truly shocked me this time. After we were seated, our server threw the menus at us. When we asked for 1 small bowl on the side, the server flashed us a disgruntled look and 'plonked' the bowl heavily onto the table. When we were finished with our meal and went to the front counter to pay the bill, (split check), the lady working there started insulting us in Cantonese (a language which the entirety of my group understood). We decided to ignore it as we just wanted to pay for our meal and leave. After paying for my own portion, and as I was getting some change out of my wallet for a tip, the lady screamed \"TIP NOT INCLUDED!\" and SHOOK her tip jar/bowl(?) at me, demanding that I tip (not sure how she arrived at the conclusion that I wouldn't tip). I was absolutely disgusted at her behavior. She proceeded to do that same towards each friend. We tipped, of course, but my perception of this once amazing restaurant has been tarnished.   I am ashamed that I brought my friends to such a place."}
{"text":"Comparing other Pho places in the area, this one is much better. Food and service quality meet my expectation. Parking space is limited, lunch time is busy because of high school area"}
{"text":"#101 is my standard order.  The size is larger than those in the north part of the city.  The Pho noodle is smooth and tasty.  The waiter/waitress speaks Mandarin rather than Vietnamese.    It is located on the 2nd floor and if you are not familiar with the location, you can miss the entrance very easily.  Given some of the reviews by Yelpers, may be that's the reason why it is quite quiet during the lunch hours.  It used to be packed!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good Pho downtown this is the place to go. Ordered a chicken Pho and veggie spring rolls. The waiter brought tea over as soon as we were seated which was perfect on a cold day. The Pho arrived and it was delicious, thicker noodles than I've usually seen in Pho but really good. The spring rolls were pretty good as well. Had the mango smoothie with it and that was also delicious, my bf had the same meal with a peach smoothie, and we both really enjoyed our lunch."}
{"text":"Best pho place I've been to (and I'm Vietnamese and I've been to Vietnam) I've been going here since I was a kid... Still go here 15 years later! Love them!"}
{"text":"This intersection is becoming plaza central for all things asian and student related.  Over the three times I have been here since they moved locations, I have noticed that they shine with their Vermicelli based dishes rather than their pho options. I found that their bun is well balanced without the overly greasy portions of meat that often appear at viet restaurants. However that being said their pho broth is ridiculously fat based and I gagged when I tried my gf's pho which she also did not enjoy.  I've had better, but I've also had worse. This is definitely a case of specialization and picking the right order is the key to a good meal."}
{"text":"Not the best food.. but good enough to satisfy a Pho craving. Agreed with a lot of the reviews here regarding service and freshness of their rolls. Stick woth the basic rare beef Pho- it's not bad."}
{"text":"I'm told by my hardcore pho friends that this place is the place to go for pho. I keep coming here but have never been impressed at all.  As soon as you walk in there is this waft of foul odour that is not coming from the beef broth. It stinks of dirty dish water. GROSS.   The best part of the pho was the noodles. The broth, as some have pointed out does not have that rich beef flavour. The noodles from their pho and bün are not over cooked which is good, but that's about all that's good. I had the BBQ chicken and porkchop and I'm sure the chef does not know how to cook meat. The porkchop had a thick piece of fat that was not trimmed or rendered off. The chicken's skin was flabby and not crispy at all.   The service was atrocious each time. They throw the menu and order forms at you. Some of the servers are really unprofessional, i.e. there is this kid server who dresses like a punk, pants falling off, and wears his hat barely on his head. Out of no where he starts swearing out loud \"oh shit! Oh shit\".   This will be my last time here."}
{"text":"I still think this place has tastiest pho in town. I've been to a lot and this place always seems to have the most flavourful broth.  Oh ya the beers are super cheap! Great way to start or end the night."}
{"text":"I've been to the location downtown on Spadina and I think it's pretty fantastic. One of my faves.  Apart from that location I've tried this location and the one at sand hurst I believe and they are both rather disappointing...  The spring rolls tend to be chewy and almost like they have been refried several times.  The pho was a bit too salty as well.   Steamed egg was rubbery and the nouc cham wasn't as sweet as I'd have liked.  Should have listened to the rest of the reviews before I stepped in."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. A few of my friends come in on a Thursday night and as soon as the waiter sees a bunch of us going up the stairs he mumbles \"F*CK\" quietly. I mean, I get that it's stressful to work in this environment but that guy deserves to get fired. We sat down, and waited... waited... waited. We finally ordered but all these guys seem to be really grumpy. They just have this look on their face as if they don't want you in there. I finally said screw it and go to another Vietnamese restaurant nearby. I didn't care that most of the food were halfway cooked already. I just wanted to get the hell out of there.  F*ck this place."}
{"text":"I like the loft-inspired space of Xe Lua, spacious and open.  Right away the high industrial ceiling grabbed my attention.  Great windows throughout the space.  Booths were very inviting, lined along one wall and the remaining tables and chairs were modern in style.  After a quick scan around the restaurant, I told myself not to expect benevolent service here.  What ever happened to service with a smile?  Wide range of affordable items on the menu.  I was impressed with extensive choices of Pho and Bun.  I thought the \"Snacks\" section on the menu was interesting, for example, Chicken Satay and Deep Fried Vietnamese Sausage.  I ordered a Large bowl of Pho with sliced raw beef and beef meatballs, vermicelli with grilled pork, and chicken satay.  - Pho with sliced raw beef and beef meatballs:   I found the broth very bland, something was missing.  I think it was the lack of spices.  Noodles were overcooked and mushy.  However, raw beef was tender and meatballs were very tasty.  + Bun, vermicelli with grilled pork, was excellent.  The best part of this dish was grilled pork.  It was well seasoned with lemongrass, crispy and yummy.  Shredded lettuce, carrots and cucumber were fresh.  - Chicken satay was different from what I grew up with.  I like my satay seasoned with herbs and spices, this version was also tasty with red chili sauce.  Overall, it was an average experience, food was decent and came out quickly."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice with friends.  Food: The pho is good but not the best. The menu holds many many items, and I find the list of sweet drinks/ desserts to be amazing, such as che ba mau. I also tried the wonton soup with egg noodles, it tasted like how it should taste, however there was too much shrimp in the wonton than pork, but that is just my preference. Be careful when ordering items that are above $10, they give you a lot of food for those items which can be bad if you are not that hungry before sitting in, happened to a friend.  Atmosphere & Service: You find a place to sit or someone seats you (not sure if that is the right word). You are given a menu, each menu item has a code, and you mark in your order on this bubble sheet. The staff members are efficient. The seating is great, the interior is clean, overall a nice environment with lots of windows.  Pricing: Pricing is fantastic for the amount of food you are getting and it is very very reasonable.  Even though I give this place just three stars, I will still come back again."}
{"text":"Below average service. Pho had way too much noodles. Used to be better and recently gotten worst."}
{"text":"I've only ever had the tea here.  We came in with a friend because she raved about the place. However, two of us were vegetarians. There was nothing on the menu that was even remotely vegetarian. We asked what they could make that didn't include animal products and the only thing they could come back with was fried rice - even then I was nervous.  Steer clear of this place if you're vegetarian."}
{"text":"driving down spadeena , my crew & yours truly came here Wednesday evening for our monthly Pho night.  The way the door stands, incorrectly directs the masses to the right side of the door.  Walk into the door (even if it looks as though it has not been operational for 2 generations) follow the stairs leading up. Once your at the top of the stairs, the bathrooms are straight (if you happen to miss the dinky \"washroom\" sign).   The table occupancies are really convenient for large groups as well as 2 people. The space is open and roomy. The walls are 3/4 all glass so you usually get a nice view of the fun activities on Spadeena. :p  This place is supposed to be the \"cool\" spot. Most the the staff speak proper English so it's easy to order.   Keep in mind, this is my first time trying Pho. So, naturally I had to get the safest option. the crew ordered,   Shredded chicken and Egg noodle Pho (me)  Grilled chkn skewers - yUMM Shrimp spring rolls -  myeh - cold spring rolls don't get no votes from moi egg noodle with dumpling pho curry lamb (FANTASTIC - the rice comes separately. The bowl of the curry is 80% broth, lamb and yukon style potatoes) Bbq chicken with rice and steamed egg (FANTASTIC) beef and chicken with rice - tad spicy.  Shrimp and chicken vermicelli - myeh vegetarian stir fry (horrible...watery, and the bok choy looked like it was melting into the watery sauce)  Green tea is served accordingly. Which is of good quality too. Not the diluted version you get at most places.   The service was partially bad. They forgot a few of the meals. With a large crowd that's usually a really awful feeling. To be the only 2 without any meals. We had to remind the waiters twice that we are still waiting on food. +_0 Bill came up to $89, which is pretty good considering we had double and triple of each on the list above.   fun fact that I learned : if you want more green tea, you raise the flap of the kettle upwards and they know to come refill.  xoxo M."}
{"text":"Since I've been a young child, every Saturday my family would take a trip to Chinatown and we would dine at Train (Xe Lua). My father's Vietnamese so he always had a preference of having Vietnamese for lunch instead of Chinese. Because of this, Train remains a restaurant close to my heart. So when it comes to this review, I might be a bit biased about Train. I remember when Train used to be on the first floor of the location, covered with cardboard boxes and sticky floors everywhere. It's come a long way from back then. However, the food still delivers.  There are two dishes that I usually order at Train, the vermicelli with barbeque pork, spring rolls and 'raw pork' (also known as Nem Chua which is Vietnamese Fermented Pork) and pho special (101).  I never used to order vermicelli at Train, but it grew on me after trying it on a hot summer day. My dad would sometimes buy Nem Chua at Nguyen Huong (a Banh Mi place down the street) and after eating it with homemade vermicelli, it was a dish that I really enjoyed. My dad would also make his own version of the Vietnamese barbeque chicken/pork when I was younger which tastes exactly like the one at Train. All the components of their vermicelli dish are ones that I have had the homemade version of and although it does taste great, I do prefer the one at Train. The fish sauce at Train is quite strong and the amount they give you tends to be too much for me as I prefer my vermicelli light and fresh. The peanuts add a nice crunchy texture to the noodles, and the bean sprouts and veggies, give it freshness. But with everything in the dish, it's a great combination.   Train uses fresh noodles while many other restaurants use dried noodles for their soups. This make a huge difference in texture as fresh noodles are softer while dry noodles are harder and less pleasant to have in pho/soups. The noodles here are also thicker than what you get at other places which I find to be a lot heartier when scooping a mouthful. The broth is nicely seasoned and isn't too salty. However, I will admit that the broth is a tad oily and will leave a film in your mouth. Tendon has always been my favourite part when it comes to \"toppings\". If you leave the tendon in the warm broth for too long, it dissolves and does add even more oil to the soup. So my suggestion is to eat it up fast before it melts into the soup. I enjoy getting both the cooked beef as well as the raw beef in my pho. The raw beef should be dipped into the warm soup so that it cooks it but the longer it sits, the tougher it'll get.  The service at Train isn't like any other restaurant. They're not known for their service but despite that, the efficiency of the food is quite impressive. It doesn't take long for your food to come, even if the place is packed. The broth of the pho, as like most Viet places, is already prepared and they just scoop it onto the noodles and meat. The prices at Train are very affordable and $10ish can get you a bowl of pho/bowl of vermicelli as well as a drink (try the 3 bean drink with coconut milk!), which is a decent amount of food.  After rereading my review, I guess there is an art to eating pho. There are certain items in the broth that are much more enjoyable when they are consumed in a certain order. That may be just me and how I eat but this is my personal review of the restaurant and food. I enjoy Train a lot and trying other Vietnamese places don't compare (...well, maybe Pho 88 is alright - but that's a review for another day). Even though I'm on a quest to experience as many Vietnamese places I can, Train will be one that I'll always come back to.  (This review is solely for the Spadina location of Train, I've been to all the other locations and quality of food is indeed different at all the locations.)"}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this pho restaurant. Notice a change with the food quality, not as fresh anymore. My bowl of pho noodles was warm, not warm enough to cook my beef noodle when i ordered NON RARE BEEF pho noodle in soup.   I was just not satisfied with the temperature of my bowl of noodles and it certainly makes a huge difference by affecting the taste of my bowl of noodle. Also I had less than 5 pieces of meat. Probably won't go back to this restaurant anymore."}
{"text":"Everytime were downtown, we come here for pho as the portions are always huge and the service is quick. Though they are quick, the servers are impolite and always ignore the customers. It takes quite a few times to get someone to take your order or ask for your bill."}
{"text":"I got the rice dish with chicken, jumbo shrimp steamed egg and a bowl of soup. The dish it self taste good but it was too oily, literally everything had oil. The chicken was oily to the point the veggie underneath was soaked. The soup was mostly oily to the point where it was soo hot that there was no steam coming from it. The service however was terrible, literally they would not try to notice you and just throws the bill and receipt at you without a care, with a careftee attitude. I would recommend just going here when ur drunk and hungry at night that you dont care about service."}
{"text":"Pho is the most simplistic yet fulfilling comfort food there is. If you're looking for a light bowl of Pho, then this is the place for you. The broth here does not have that thick beef flavour, but has an authentic and \"fresh\" taste to it. Also, the noodles are the thick type, so if you like the typical small and thin noodles, you should ask for a change. However, the thick noodles suit my liking more so it was perfect for me. My tongue wasn't itchy or anything after so I was extremely satisfied with the broth. Also, sizes are very good considering the price. I shared a large with a friend and it was perfect.   I would have given this place 4 stars if it weren't for the dishes that weren't pho. I ordered the pineapple fried rice and it was super disappointing. The presentation was amazing as the rice came in a pineapple but the flavour was ... there was literally no flavour. It was the epitome of bland and maybe they forgot their seasoning? If you're craving pineapple fried rice, I would recommend Restoran Malaysia which is across the street!"}
{"text":"If its 3am and you are not a Pho Train, then you are missing out. I've been coming here for about 4 years now on a regular basis. The food is delicious and the staff are super friendly. Just make sure to ask for thin noodles in your pho!!! And if you want amazing service, ask for Bin Bin, shes our favourite server."}
{"text":"Our favourite place to have pho. They make the best avacado milkshake drink. Friendly staff, they will greet you the moment you walk in. Food over all is delicious (e.g. porkchop and rice, spring rolls, etc).  The only con about this place is lack of parking space available during peak hours and the washrooms are all the way in the basement. They do have a handicap washroom upstairs, but no one seems to be allowed to use it.   I've seen people ordering a large bowl of pho and the staff are fine to give you extra bowls to share amongst the family/kids."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Pho restaurant in Chinatown. I have to admit, I haven't tried them all, but definitely all the ones on that main strip of Spadina. The prices are cheap, it tastes good, and they don't skimp on the meat!!  The best soup noodle dish there: Beef Brisket Curry. SO DELICIOUS, you have to try it. It's the dish that pushed this place over the others to become my favourite.  They also got new menus since the last time I went there, so they're much prettier to peruse now."}
{"text":"This place is probably the worst pho place I've ever been too. It was decent when I was a child, but now 2 decades later, it really has gone downhill.   About a month ago I came here for pho with my brother and he ordered pho with rare beef and beef balls; its not specifically on the menu but restaurants normally customize it for us for the same price. When the bill came his pho was charged an extra $1 because they said what he ordered was not on the menu. However, they only added 2 small beef balls, and if he ordered their pho dac biet it would have came with the rare beef, beef balls and other toppings.  Their food is also not authentic and is very bland in general. I only came to this place because a friend chose it. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless I really disliked them."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place only has 3 stars. I've been here for years. You're always able to find a seat or you'll be seated in minutes.  I reckon this place has the best bunh (cold noodle salad with fish sauce) in the city chock full of spring roll and sprouts and etc! Super flavorful and fresh. I know people think the service is rude and slow but if it's an Asian eatery, it's really not rude to flag down the waiter. I also recommend the coconut milkshake or avocado milkshake."}
{"text":"Came here for my regular pho fix. Spent $10 on parking on spadina. Walked up to the front entrance of the restaurant, it was closed at 4 pm!!  They had a makeshift sign on the glass door saying \" we are closed for the week due to drain issues\"  Awful experience !"}
{"text":"After going to my friend Linda's birthday party at a downtown Toronto nightlife venue, we decided to grab a late-night meal.  Everybody agreed on pho-train, I had no idea what that was, it turns out it's this place only renamed. I don't do nightclubs, so I don't know the after-party restaurants, but this one apparently is one of the most popular.  We took a seat, then decided to move to another table.  Some guy grabbed me to compliment on my jewelry.  I got a rice & chicken dish, everyone else got pho. I saw the same girls at the club whom I refused to dance with, despite them grabbing at me and forcing my arms up and down.  My rule is simple:  No girls at nightclubs.   It's not worth it...  This restaurant became the last straw for me, not because it wasn't good, but because it's not any different from all the other supposed Vietnamese restaurants in the city.  There is no variation between them! I've been to Vietnam, and there are plenty of restaurants, and almost none of them shared traits.  Vietnamese cuisine is more than a bowl of noodle soup, or fried chicken cutlets.  How have they gotten away with this??  Wonderwall Spontaneously broke out among the restaurant of drunken douchebags and trollops after this guy obviously seeking attention began shamelessly singing for no reason.  This is not cool, this is very hipster!   It's freaking groundhog day for Vietnamese Cuisine in this country!!"}
{"text":"Great portions at great prices. If you're stopping by, the spicy (actually seasoned but not that spicy) tofu is a must! The pho is a given but also try the vermicelli bowls!"}
{"text":"Chicken pho is really good, service is fast and accurate. Love that they have the fresh pho noodle option!"}
{"text":"As I stepped into the restaurant, it was filled with smoke. But the noodle in soup was good."}
{"text":"Hmm, Im going to keep this one short.  This place is 10 times better buzzed after clubbing then perfectly sober and coming for lunch.  Guess beer googles also blurr the taste buds! :X"}
{"text":"One of the better pho places open late in Chinatown. Decent prices and food quality is generally consistent. This place gets a bad name since this is where a lot of people go to get food after a night out. When you have a lot of drunk people in one area, sometimes situations get a little out of control. Other than that, I regularly frequent this place. The broth is not too oily and salty. The rare beef and flank are tender as well."}
{"text":"It's not the most authentic pho in town, but hey, if it tastes good,  it tastes good right?   This is one of the most welcoming Pho Xe Lua restaurants from the other locations I've visited in Toronto. They're always quick with their service and probably the most friendliest Asian restaurant I've been too ever. And that's saying a lot because Asian restaurants don't have the greatest reputation for service.   When I'm feeling the option to have fresh noodles in my pho (which is often), it's awesome. I'm also a sucker for their bun (vermicelli). I like how thinly they chop the veggies because it brings a light, refreshing texture, and that the spring roll is actually fried with rice paper roll instead of regular Chinese spring roll wrappers that other restaurants do... Helps the authenticity.   I gave this place a 5 star because even though they don't have the best pho in town, they have great variety of dishes, everything tastes great, great service, and fresh noodles. I've never had any difficulty with this place ever and I don't foresee any issues. A happy customer goes a long way *thumbs up*"}
{"text":"I seriously think this restaurant has changed hands in owners. When they first opened (before I started yelping) it was a true-and-true Vietnamese restaurant. Now, the establishment, food quality, and service is a far cry from what it used to be. Pho Xe Lua is a big name in Vietnamese Cuisine and sadly this place no longer reflects the brand. Instead it is operated by Mandarin speaking Chinese workers.  ENVIRONMENT:  - washrooms are dirty, no ventilation at all, smelly, and worse of all the faucet was broken! No running water!!!  - tables and chairs were icky. I don't think they wipe down the place with a clean rag. - baby booster seats were also icky, and the retention straps are terribly inadequate and difficult to use. I'm glad I brought my own portable high-chair for my kid.  FOOD: - overly salted! The broth in the pho was very salty and oily, particularly due to the fresh noodles which are oily so they don't stick. - the fresh noodles were still clumped in a cake shape, from the fridge I assume. Not good for presentation and it cools down the soup. - I was very thirsty after the meal. I had to drink copious amounts of water about an hour later because of the high sodium levels. - milk shakes are watered down and had an unpleasant freezer-ice taste.  SERVICE: - speed was okay, but attitude was rude.  VERDICT: We will never go back."}
{"text":"Kind of did not want to downgrade this place but after broadening my horizons and going to some more out of the way Viet restaurants I can see how this place lacks in quality of food.   Still a regular here after a night out and sometimes even on the weekend for the cheap beer and convenient location."}
{"text":"* Pho is great * Place looks clean * Average priced * Quiet location with decent service"}
{"text":"This is my parents go to place when they're downtown and probably one of our favourite Vietnamese restaurants. Prices are super reasonable and portions are huge. My mom and I love their lamb curry and order it everytime! (so flavourful and addictive) My dad always gets the pho and really likes their broth. I do believe the service could be better, but the food comes quick, so I can't really complain. Anyways, my family will definitely keep coming here!"}
{"text":"Pho Train is famous.  Seriously, my friends from Waterloo have seen videos of the historic Asian fight/faceplate that took place here. (Oh, btw, I don't know anyone who calls this place \"Xe Lua\". It's Pho Train.)  My review might be a bit skewed, seeing as how 90% of the time I eat here it is after consuming a substantial amount of alcohol. But in my experience, the pho here never disappoints at 3am on a Friday/Saturday night, when all the post-clubbing Asians (and some non-Asians who've caught on) gather for the age-old hangover cure. The avocado smoothie is also pretty dece, as are a few of their other drinks (the 3-colour-drink with jelly, red bean, and coconut milk is really good). The curry chicken I once sampled from here was also quite tasty.  I'll be back, with admittedly thinly veiled hopes of witnessing more drunken Asian drama."}
{"text":"The pho is the only decent part about the place, none of the other dishes taste that good. I think service was fine, and it's pretty cheap. Good to eat when I don't want to cook or I'm feeling hungry."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place!! Their chicken Satay soup and Shrimp on sugarcane are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Went by around 1PM and the place was packed. Though tempted by the banh xeo and vermicelli dishes, most people were having pho so I decided to go with that.   Ordered one of the standard beef pho dishes and was happily surprised to be given the option of fresh noodles instead of dry. The broth was very flavourful and tasty. There were a ton of noodles and lots of tendon. Maybe there could have been a bit more beef.   The Large size was plenty big - probably more than I needed. The table next to me had all ordered XL pho and the bowls were crazy big. Something to keep in mind when I'm looking for a place to feed teenagers.   My first time at this location of Xe Lua and it was very good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Classic 2012 Halloween brawl WSHH (youtube.com/watch?v=1XoT6VQE0q8).   Good tasting pho (get the 101 or 102, don't get the meat balls one) and vermicelli. Their service is usually pretty fast so no complaints there. Pretty dirty but standard for Chinatown. Try to get the booths/seatings right next to wall, it helps with enjoying the food.   For drinks get the avocado shake, its actually prettyyyy good.  Note: Substitute for egg noodle is free for all the pho items. Be sure to get it if you hate wide rice noodles."}
{"text":"Wow. Canadian PHO Restaurants sure open late. This one in Chinatown opens: Sunday to Thursday 9AM to 4AM Friday to Saturday 9AM to 5AM  Open even later than the bars.   I stayed up late, just to eat PHO at past midnight in Canada. This is a second floor restaurant, so pretty easy to walk past if you don't notice the train symbol for the restaurant. Walked up stairs and thought it was pretty clean and had a huge menu book. By far, one of the most collective Vietnamese menus I have seen because they served pho, clay pot, seven course beef, salads, variety of spring rolls, Banh Cuon, etc... On top of that, they had an order form you would fill out like some dim sum places you go to.   My past midnight snack consist of the following: * Pho Dat Biet [XL Large $8.50 CAD, Large $6.50, Small $5.50] (3 of 5) - Decent PHO. Soup, noodle, and beef was ok. No complaints.  * Bi Cuon Shredded Pork Skin Rolls $3.50 CAD (3 of 5) - Decent spring roll. I don't always see this on the menu so it was nice to try it.  * Banh Cuon Cha Lua Steamed Rice Flour Rolls with Viet Sausage $5.00 CAD (3 of 5) - This was a surprise on the menu. We never see it in SF so we had to order it. It was a great deal for $5.00 CAD. Almost like a salad dish. Too bad the rice flour roll was a little soggy and the lettuce was a little rusty. But still for $5.00, a great appetizer dish on top of the already ordered PHO.  Large menu and open late night. Great place to grab a hot PHO after the bar or for a quick Viet snack bite."}
{"text":"C'est l'un des seuls resto viet ouverts jusqu'à 5h du matin le samedi soir, pensez-y si vous sortez de boîte et que vous voulez manger un phô! Le service est rapide et la qualité des plats est très correcte!  //The only vietnamese joint opened until 5am on a Saturday around College and Spadina. If you just getting out from a club and craving for a phô it's the place to go! Cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"Xe Lua right on Bayview in a small strip plaza is nothing to rave about but it is close by and in a neighbourhood that lacks a decent pho place.  It is also right across a High School so it can be crammed during lunch hours during the weekdays.  Pricing and size of pho is on par with the avg pho restaurant .  Service was bad but I didn't expect to be \"wow\" in that department."}
{"text":"If you like pho, you can't really go wrong with his place.  I've been to this Chinatown location and the one in Richmond Hill.  I actually like the Richmond Hill one a little better.  Some of their dishes are quite different than the Chinatown one.    But what you really need to know is the pho is good, the other stuff they have on the menu is also pretty good, and the prices are reasonable.  A lot of the other reviewers say that the service sucks but if you get out of that mentality that you have to be pampered to the extreme, the service is actually pretty good.  You mark down what you want on a piece of paper and off they go.  I've always gotten my stuff pretty fast there and they always get you what you ask for if you flag them down.    I recommend this place not only for the food but for their big variety of drinks and shakes.  Try some, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Errr...what?  This place is good?  Unfortunately, that wasn't my experience.  So to start with, the prices are reasonable and the portions are a good size.  Also, the spring rolls here were quite good.  The pho though was a disaster, and was some of the worst I've ever had.  Broth is absolutely the most important part of pho, as that's where all the flavor comes from, but the broth at Xe Lua tasted very watery.  I actually think it may have been made with bouillon, as I noticed water and this mysterious brown powder were separating from each other after a few minutes.  This is a big no-no - pho broth should come from simmering beef bones and spices for several hours, not from tossing some powder in a pot of boiling water.  I'll be coming back to Toronto as often as possible because I really enjoyed my short time there, but I will definitely not be going back to Xe Lua."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at any time in this cold weather, so refreshing after a noodle soup! Service is quick and the soup is really well made, so flavorful. It's a must try location! Price is pretty decent  The only draw back is the parking is limited at buddy times"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????pho??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????pho??????????size?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"I was considering giving this place 0 but that's not possible.  oh well.    I came to this place for bun.  It was pretty disgusting that my rice noodles tasted like they were soaked in dirty dishwater.   Enough said?  If it was an \"off\" day, they officially turned me OFF from ever returning."}
{"text":"Really busy after the clubbing district let's out. Nice option for a late night meal but not the best pho in the city by any means. I've had lots of different things here, not a huge fan of the pho but the bun is nice. They use thicker noodles than usual which is a bit strange, but not too bad. I also think it's a bit overpriced compared to other Viet places, but given it's popularity with the clubbing crew I guess its no surprise."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Hard to argue with value.  This place is new and of course its going to be clean.  The service is on the above average side, nothing extravagant.  The food portion is plentiful and the taste of my pho was very flavourful.  The first time my wife and I came here our soups looked extremely greasy but we wanted to give it another try and we are glad we did.  We frequent this place often.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing mind blowing, but they do serve very good pho, bun and a very very good bowl of sate which is a spciy peanuty glutinous soup, sooo very good, and it;s what i usually order here. That dish specifically is impssoble to find anywhere but there sadly, so this is the main reason i keep returning.   Fast service, clean tables good food for SUPER CHEAP!!   can't go wrong here, if you're picky and have special instructiuons for your meal, then this place may not be for you."}
{"text":"Everything tasted so bad , I think this place had the bad pho I ever had. We had 6 people and none of us had good plates or bowls, and everything wasn't hot at all. If you want authentic Vietnamese foods, don't go there. Don't let the crowd fool you."}
{"text":"I order takeout from this place all the time and I never had a bad service like I hand today. I ordered take out and waited as usual. The food came out quickly but the server pretends that he did not see it and started to do other things. I waited for 10 minutes then I pointed out that the order is ready, the server still pretends that he is busy and ignored me and tried to do a few pointless things. Getting the order and hand the order to me will only take 30 seconds. But he just wonder around and prefers that he has more important things to do. 2 or 3 minutes later, he finally decided to get my order. I walked over and tried to take the order from his hand, he totally ignores me, like I did  not exist and walked over me to put the order on the table !!!  He could of done that 13 minutes ago !!! I find the guy to be very rude !! There are plenty of Vietnamese restaurant in the area, and they are nothing special. I don't think that I will be back to this place."}
{"text":"Waiter asked for a tip which is unprofessional. Disappointed that the size of the pork chop in my main was small as compared to nearby restaurants. Waiters don't ask if everything is okay during the meal?"}
{"text":"Vegetarians stay away from here!! The extensive menu has only eight dishes listed as vegetarian and I'm convinced that the tofu mushroom hot pot has a meat broth even though the server weakly assured us it was veg. They don't have even basic sauces that are plant based to go with the bun (noodle bowl), and for sure everything is fried in animal fat. Avoid it."}
{"text":"I've been to a LOT of Pho places in Toronto and Xe Lua still remains one of the places I'll return to fairly regularly. You'd wonder why I wouldn't give it a higher rating but it's all relative to the other better options out there. That being said, it's still a solid option that never disappoints.  Regarding their food. The normal non-pho options are pretty standard against most other Vietnamese places. Their pho itself is on the high average side in regard to broth quality, noodles, and meat quality/quantity. There is one dish that really keeps me coming back here and other people have confirmed and agreed with me that their curry goat soup is one of the best in Toronto. This one dish truly shines here and as long as they keep making this one dish so well, they'll have me returning regularly."}
{"text":"The staff is very cocky, and give attitude to customer. Food is good, but i will not come to this restaurant any more!!!!"}
{"text":"Ahh Train. I have a soft spot for this place. I've been going here since I was a kid when it used to be downstairs with weird fish tanks and greedy floors. Since then they've moved upstairs, got a whole facelift and modernized everything but they decided to keep the grease floors.  Food here is not the best and there are better places in Toronto like Pho Linh and Pho Tien Thanh but it's probably the most well known and best in terms of the Chinatown area. Service is mediocre, sometimes great and sometimes bad depending on how the guys working there are feeling that day. Prices are fair and similar to other places at under $10 per person usually.  Opens late and great for groups. Most people don't need this review because they know about train but for those who are new to Toronto or to Chinatown then this is a good start. Just know that if you do decide to go at night say on a Friday/Saturday then watch out for flying plates or guys with swat gear."}
{"text":"Not the cleanest or nicest venue, but the food is great if you can ever manage to order it :P (trying to say the service isn't the best).  Also, my first time there they screwed up our order and I had to spend 25 minutes arguing with a Chinese gentleman who could barely speak English. And I speak absolutely no Chinese... :S Maybe I'll learn..."}
{"text":"The service is fast and the servers are very friendly! I prefer this location than the one at Spadina-China Town. The pho is awesome !"}
{"text":"Group sports activity aftermath = pho.  Wings and beer would seem to be the more obvious choice, but my mates and I could throw any number of suggestions out there, and pho  is the only option that we could all come to a consensus on.    At 'Train', the hefty quantity offered in a large bowl of pho (currently $6) is enough to leave me stuffed with no room for anything else, including my favourite avocado shake. *sniff*  What a dilemma deciding between eating less pho, or skipping out on a thick, creamy shake!  This place is consistently a good value for money, is always open and I like the newish colourful menus, however, I'm still thinking of the time I went and the table was cleaned with a smelly cloth.  Conclusion: Train is a solid restaurant if you're short on ideas or if it's really late.  Also, it doesn't skimp on its portions.  Otherwise, there are better options out there."}
{"text":"ok, so evidently this place has terrible service.  of COURSE it does, it's asian and it caters to young, cheap, poor students that and the drunk club-goers at 5am.   So yes, lets get beyond the obvious- service sucks. BUT,  1) the food is excellent.  Get the pho or the rice and meat dishes- won't be disappointed. Second best restaurant in Chinatown I have been to (first is Asian Legend)  2) it has a CLEAN and modern interior- so no gross plastic table liners and bugs crawlin around  3) It's on the second floor (which in chinatown makes for a MUCH cleaner restaurant- really)  4) it's cheap.  oh so cheap.  5) It has insane hours- I've been here til 6am in the morning as they are cleaning up.  So yes, the servers walk around like they hate their lives.  but it has everything you need in a proper chinatown restaurant.  I always come here when Asian Legend is closed."}
{"text":"This place gets worse every time we go there. The fresh noodles is the only thing this place has going for it. So it was a Thursday evening restaurant was barely busy, 4/5 tables max?  Our table ordered spring rolls for appetizer, pho for date and I got a rice dish. Only thing that came out was the pho. When the server brought the bill he looked confused, asked if I still wanted the food I refused. Went up to pay the bill which was around $8 and they have a $10 limit on debit and credit, we have to buy a pop to make up the difference."}
{"text":"Compared to the Vietnamese place across the street in the Food Basics plaza, this one is better, but definitely not a place I would choose when I'm craving Vietnamese even though it's minutes from my house. I've tried two dishes here. The first was the spring roll vermicelli, which I found to be bland. I even had to ask for two bowls of fish sauce because the sauce itself seemed too diluted. In terms of the pho, I was not a fan of their noodles. The texture reminded me too much of Chinese noodles."}
{"text":"The pho and other meat/rice dishes are not that good... and their service does not make this entire experience any better. Their pho is extremely greasy and quite salty, leaving my throat and stomach quite uncomfortable. Their rice and meat dishes are also quite greasy, and I cannot say that any of their food feels authentic.  Their service is not very good, but it seems like most of the employees are overworked because of the long hours and just lack of passion for the job. Although the restaurant itself is located in Chinatown, that doesn't mean patrons should overlook bad service.   If you're looking for a place to try out Vietnamese food, this is not the best choice. This restaurant is one of the few spots to choose from if you're out late and looking for a midnight snack of some sort."}
{"text":"Affordable meals with good portion sizes however the food is quite oily and not the best quality. The mango salad was extremely oily and salty. The spicy chicken dish wasn't the greatest quality either. We barely touched the spring rolls because they were mushy and again, very oily."}
{"text":"1. I'm a Pho & Bun Fiend. 2. I have practically had a bowl of Pho in every city I've been to across North America & parts of the UK. 3. I love Pho, BUT I only categorize Pho in 3 categories.  Awesome, Okay, Bleh. 4. I only have the fully loaded special.  So to qualify for the Awesome Category, the special really has to be FULLY loaded.  Tendons, tripe, the works!  Next is the broth.  You've got to taste the meaty marrowy goodness in the Broth.  3rd is the Noodles.  I'm not so picky, it just has to be the thick kind and not the thin round ones.  Lastly, the service has to be okay.  You don't have to treat me like a prince, but you do have to come serve me in a reasonable amount of time, and be reasonably clean.  Reasonably.  This is Pho after all.  I expect a certain level of dive in my Pho.    Service levels at the Gerrard location is night and day vs the Spadina Locale.  The Gerrard one feels like a family run business, and the service has always been spectacular.  Meanwhile the ultra busy Spadina one generally treats me like a McDonalds drive by.    What makes Xe Lua work is the fresh noodles that you can't get everywhere.  I think the broth is good enough (not the best), and most importantly, I get the good yummy bits, as in the tendon and the tripe.  They've also got the best Spring Rolls this side of Toronto, and I usually wash it all down with a Red Bean Shake.  Not the perfect date place as there's a nice dive factor, but I'd only want to marry a girl who can appreciate a classic Pho Restaurant."}
{"text":"I thought Toronto had some of the best restaurants in the world! This must not be on of them. This place was just horrible..... the broth was not beefy at all. Tasted like straight MSG. They didn't even use the normal phó noodles. They used Chinese ho fun noodles! HORRIBLE, JUST HORRIBLE! I wanted the bun rieu, but they ran out of the bun rieu! What the hell... how do you run out of bun rieu at 12pm! RAWR! HORRIBLE! I'm never eating phó in toronto ever again, but i guess it's because they don't have a Vietnamese community like we do in the BAY AREAA!!!!! When you Canadians come out to the bay, check out the Vietnamese restaurants here and you'll get blown away by how good it is!"}
{"text":"After about 3-4 times coming to this place, im starting to love it. Pho's are really good, not to mention the serving and price. Place is really clean and good service.   This is a good vietnamese restaurant, will be going back in the future!"}
{"text":"It isn't authentic pho in the sense that a. It is in Chinatown so it is probably made by Chinese/Vietnamese people (but still good) and b. they don't use the vermicelli pho noodles but the flat fat noodles (ho-fun). Regardless, it tastes good, the food comes quick, service is efficient and the restaurant has good seating accommodations for a large quantity of people if you have a group dinner. They also have booths for more side and dinners for small groups"}
{"text":"I convinced my family to eat here 3 times because I love the satay beef noodle soup tastes so good in the Toronto east Chinatown location. After moving to Markham and in the name of nostalgia, I finally made my visit to this location.  To my surprise the satay beef noodle here tastes good in consistence with my hometown location.    The reasons this review is a low 1 star is because my mom got diarrhea all 3 times we went here after eating her beef pho.  She said the taste was fine but for whatever reasons it gave her the runs everytime she got home.  This location is poorly operated, it's rarely even seated more than a few tables yet the service is very slow. Takes so long to get your waitress attention because she is the only one there and our food takes way too long to come. There's many other better restaurants around Markham for me to come back here to ever give it another try.  Not wasting my calories and time here again."}
{"text":"It's chinese run so it's definitely not authentic but they do serve a decent bowl of pho here. Sometimes all it takes is the addition of fresh rice noodles and voila! that'll make up for the weak broth and lack of saw/cilantro. Prices are pretty good too, some dishes are cheaper than other places around town. And oh if you're hungry go for the xtra large-they mean xtra large here. I made a quarter dent in my xtra large most of those precious rice noodles had to go to waste. D'arrrgh."}
{"text":"This place receives no crowns nor any accolades. Came here three times and each time I had an issue with the server. They're all men, no women in the house.. HOW DO YOU RUN A PLACE WITHOUT WOMEN?! It's no surprise when I holla that I won't get a holla back. Asked a gentleman 3 times for a flippin' bowl and he disappears. Ask and you shall receive? When you're eating here, ask and you shall be ignored. However, there were other gentlemen that were very courteous and attentive to customers. That's the difference with men service and women service - women does it better while men does it typically half ass.. Yes offence lol  Food was ok, not the best. Portion was not stellar but passable. Pho should NEVER, EVAR be thick noodles.. It should be the dry (thin) noodles. My gripe will always be that for every chinese run Pho restaurant.. Arghhh"}
{"text":"It's not that bad actually. The one on hwy 7 and mccowan (Pho 99?) is bad.. The noodles you can change to the thin noodles and not \"ho fun\"."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great prices - excellent value for the money! I recommend the Vietnamese sausage and the mango salad."}
{"text":"I always end up here when I'm dying for Pho or I'm just flat out drunk.  Honestly I have tried all the other Pho places in Chinatown and I have to say that this one is the best one. Not the most clearest soup base but nonetheless yummy for the tummy."}
{"text":"Xe Lua pretty much set my high standards for pho. As a Vietnamese/Chinese Canadian, this is truly the place to go to if you are in the mood or craving for pho ! Service is excellent, there are a lot of menu choices with reasonable prices!  Obviously, you have to try their pho, they have many ways and sizes you can enjoy your bowl of pho. Their are many other menu items to try like their rice dishes and vermicelli dishes . If you are only trying Xe Lua for the first time, the one drink you must consider ordering is their hè au õ, Xin Xáo, Nùoc Dua (Red Bean, Grass Jello with Coconut Milk & Ice), the perfect drink to compliment your meal ! You will not regret coming to Xe Lua, still one of the most authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Fast and cheap, ordered way too much! Food was decent. Atmosphere just okay. Got put for under twenty apiece. Sauces at the table were great and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Had takeout and it was really good ... The spring roll was a little over cooked but the noodles and bbq pork was great! Would totally come back! So man good Vietnamese places in this area"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this place when it was located downstairs and nothing has changed much except the size of the place.  I only go here after a night of drinking and I want some soup to sober me up and it's one of the only pho places other than Pho Pasteur that is still open at 2am in the morning otherwise I would never ever go here for Pho.  Most of their business comes late at night from the club crowd who are looking for something to eat and to sober them up.   Some dishes are not bad but their Pho is pretty bad. 1. Their broth has no flavour. 2. They are guilty of overcooking their noodles quite often. 3. Their meat is quite suspect.  Yes, I go here but only when I'm intoxicated and I'm starting to think that the people that say this is the best Pho in Toronto fall in the late night clubber category.  If you don't agree head to Pho Tien Thanh on Ossington or Pho Linh on College St and you will notice a huge difference in what a authentic bowl fo Pho should taste like. Also, you don't see many Vietnamese ppl or families eating here, which is a true sign of authenticity.  Service: Other than Alex who has been there for years, many of the staff do not know what they are doing or what a lot of the dishes are. We asked for Canh Chua Ca one time, which is a Vietnamese sour fish soup and the guy had no clue what I was asking for until I showed him the menu number."}
{"text":"good taste but the worst service  i wait with my girlfriend like 20 minutes for somebody but never apear i have to go for leave my order then he food come and we ask for some lemon and this guy never apear again my girl have to go and ask for those and not only us three or more tables too"}
{"text":"Rare beef, tendon with pho is delicious. Broth is great! Comes with a good amount of beef, tendon and noodles.   Beef sauté is also delicious. Broth is thick and full of flavour.  All their noodle soups come with the thick noodles so if you are used to the thin noodles, ask for it ahead of time.  Service is great. They're fast and nice.  Atmosphere is nice and clean.   I come here often with my husband."}
{"text":"No lemongrass chicken? Well there was a stir fry but that was kinda oily. Good for the price I guess. Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"Clearly no one has love for Chinatown East (sorry, not \"Old Chinatown\" as previously stated).  The Choo Choo train strikes again!  This place was a staple of mine nearly every week during my volleyball season.  It's the perfect place to get super cheap eats when you only have 30 minutes to order, eat, and pay.    They do everything at this Chinese-run joint fairly well, but nothing spectacular.  Furthermore, some standard Vietnamese items seem to be omitted from this menu (as I recall, banh guon was not on the menu last time I went).  Any attempts to speak Vietnamese to the Cantonese server will also get you blank stares.   Still, the fresh noodle pho will never let you down.  4-stars for the pho, 3.5 for the rest of the menu.  In and out and 30 minutes and everyone is happy."}
{"text":"Ok...update time...   The pho here has gone noticeably downhill (so have the noodles) my last several visits. My previous review stuck up for them, but I can't do it anymore. The broth has gone from a nice authentic flavor to a watered down mess. Even their signature fat fresh noodles are not as silky smooth as they once were.   The Gerrard location has a much better, more consistent output for pho. Luckily, the other menu items, like the banh cuon, are still a-ok."}
{"text":"Ive been here several times years ago, and remembered Xe Lua to be a decent, no frills restaurant. I decided to come back last night after wandering around TO in search for a quick dinner. I regretted my choice almost instantly.   Although the food tasted standard, the 1 star comes from the ridiculous amount of fruit flies swarmimg our table; every time I looked back down at my bowl, there were 1 or 2 new flies chilling on the edge of it. Not. Cool. Not only were the flies swarming around the beansprouts, food, drinks and the table (how stupid can the flies be to purposefully fly into something that will kill them????), there were also a ton of them in the air where I was sitting. I also dont want to forget to mention my mini fruitfly napkin graveyard off to the side of my table. Fan. Tastic.  Maybe it's because we sat near the kitchen. Maybe it was nearing the end of the day and they didn't get a chance to take out the garbage yet. In any case, there is no excuse for any restaurant to let fruitflies run rampant in the dining room (or anywhere else)."}
{"text":"Great pho, they have an extra large size bowl with the works for $10, that can be shared for up to two people. Their pork chop on rice is terrible, the pork chop was fatty and chewy, the pork is from the shoulder of the pig, My wife didn't even enjoy the dish, ask the waiter about the issue and he looked at me, as he didn't seem to care and stated that I ate most of the dish, yes we ate half of the white rice and a piece of the fatty pork, I would have been ok if he attempted to change the protein instead of the whole entire dish, but he didn't offered any solution and walked away. Overall the pho and soup were great but their customer service and their fatty pork sucks."}
{"text":"There's a video of some Vietnamese guys getting into a physical altercation in this restaurant on youtube. Came here late at night for pho. Bathroom was disgusting. Pho was acceptable."}
{"text":"Was craving some pho soup so we decided to walk to Chinatown. I read some good reviews about this place and decided to try it out.  I got the beef and meatball pho soup.  It was a large for about 7 bucks.   Good prices for large portions.  I took the rest to go as I couldn't finish it all."}
{"text":"The portions are small, the noodles are thick and soup base oily and salty (msg).  Service is horrible and rude, they don't go the extra way to put the dish infront of the person, they just slap on the end of the table and walk away.  they don't say thank you or bye when you leave (even when walking by them).  Just go across the street to Vic Hong which is a bit better if you don't want to drive far from this location.  Probably good for the high school crowd but nowhere close to competing with other Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"This is my \"Cheers\" inspired review.  Sometimes you want to go,  Where nobody knows your name, but you're always glad you came.   You want food that is comforting, a place that's open in the morning.  You want go where prices remain the sameeeeee.  Truthfully, 'Xe Lua Restaurant' deserves a three star. The service is bland, the food is mediocre but the price is right and they are perhaps the better option for Pho compared to the many other locations along Dundas and Spadina. So, because of these last two points I have to bump them up to a four star.  For a first time experience consider ordering a small or medium Pho Special 101.  'Cheers'!"}
{"text":"Just came back from a bowl of Pho. And my thoughts on it...  This place is horrible, lots of issues. I haven't been here in many, many, years and they just reaffirms my feelings about this place. 1 star is way too flattering. Stay away, you've been warned. It's Sunday night 8pm, and you would expect it to be packed like other restaurants, but there were only 2 people in there. Bad sign, should have kept walking to Mi Mi.  I ordered my usual Pho Dac Biet to compare, somehow its #101 on everyone's menu. lol. Most of the vietnamese Pho restaurant better get it right. I was born in vietnam and been eating it for years, I should know!  But somehow they seem to want to skimp on it or miss the mark completely. I notice the waitress speaks Mandrin to me. lol Second, while I was eating she was moping the floor!!! Hello?!?  The decor was tacky and had this childish beach scene. Bleh, managment should have figured it out by now. Desperately in need of a good remodeling.  Okay, on to the Pho, I was asked for a choice of fresh or dried noodles. I did ask for fresh, (which they're know for) but the bowl came with the dried noodles instead. Holy! how can you get that wrong!!!, fresh taste springy and looks more bleached like it came out -- well, fresh!!! The Pho came with the usual tripe, flank, beef balls, and rare beef. NO brisket.   They really skimp on the tripe and rare beef. (I'm sure they did this on purpose because they loaded it up with pork - which is a cheap substitute). I counted 2 pieces of beef and 5 pieces of tripe. I was moving the Pho around to see if it was underneath (definitely a WTF momemt). The broth was kinda cloudy and wasn't clear, but was good. Wasn't hot at all, more like warm. So I'm bombarded with all this flank, which is by far the worst part of any Pho, I've never seen any place that does the pork right or to my liking.  Skimping on the beef and fresh noodles and having poor decor, recipe for disaster. Go order the same thing at each restaurant and try Pho Xe Lua and you'll see the difference. Poor management decision to skimp on the beef.   Go across the street to Pho 88 or Mi Mi, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place on and off for years regularly. The staff remember me. Today I went there for lunch and ordered a chicken and beef rice dish. I bit into the chicken and it had a strong foul taste and I immediately spit it out in disgust. The meat was clearly going bad. I went to the front desk to talk about the issue and all they had to say was \"sorry\". They charged me full price for the dish. Obviously I walked out without tipping and will never go back. It's amazing how some of these places have zero customer service.  UPDATE: I reported the case to City of Toronto food safety department and they visited this business. They got back to me and confirmed multiple food safety violations and their status is now conditional."}
{"text":"this is part of my college experience... along with quite a few other china-town restaurants ofcourse. After i moved away from d/t area for a while i couldn't find a pho place like this, until recently i found another branch by steels and yonge! YES!  Everytime my parents are in town we always go there. dad loves the pho too!  best pho ever! my fav things are pho, bun bo hue, spring rolls, curry beef with rice, chick with onion and lemon grass."}
{"text":"2 stars simply because the pho.. oh nooooo..   The store itself is clean and I never have to wait too long (thank god pho is the fast food of vietnam). The service is fast and the food comes faster, so nothing to complain about there. I've tried the viet vermicelli, which I've always enjoyed so nothing is off about that! Fresh meat and chewy noodles, mmm... how do I always manage to make myself hungry through my reviews.. oh man. My boyfriend has tried the satay beef noodles, which was pretty good- not really satay at all but it had a great thick spice to it.. however, it was a bit oily.   Now.. the pho.. oh goodness. Now, I don't mind the thickness of the noodle at all, in fact the noodles are the best part of this disaster. Chewy, textured and not overcooked- great! The beef was hard and stiff without much flavour, and the broth was just.. meh? It didn't leave me with the usual satisfying feeling I have when I eat pho, which sucks!! I've also had this coconut milk with jelly before and it was SO gross! Coconut milk is already sweet by itself and doesn't need additional sugar!! It was sweet to the point where I couldn't continue on after a sip..  All in all.. not a good pho place, but I'd come back if I was in the immediate area looking for a quick bite! Sticking with the satay noodles if I want a warm meal next time!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The pho is pretty good but my favourite is the curry goat soup number 218!  It is quite special and a must try!  Xe Lua is one of only 2 restaurants that I have ever found that serve this dish and it is what keeps me coming back!  The spring rolls are really good too."}
{"text":"Pros: - Staff are accommodating. - Overall, food was tasty and was consistent with other Xe Lua restaurants in terms of quality.  - Food is prepared quickly.  Cons: - Takeout was definitely rushed. Utensils were thrown in together with the bag full of basil leaves and washed bean sprouts. - Not enough meat for the beef noodle pho and chicken pho that was ordered as part of the takeout order. - The take out bag smelled like sweat. Not exactly an ideal for takeout."}
{"text":"My order: Special Beef Noodle Soup (4/5): Broth was good, I didn't need to add any hoisin sauce. Beef was also delicious. Nothing to complain about here, just your standard Vietnamese noodle soup. Sour Sop Milkshake (5/5): Amazing, I loved it. Having never eaten sour sop before, I ordered it just to say I'd tried it, but I ended up with possibly an all-time favourite.  The service:  Basically nonexistent: You call them to hand in you order, and you walk yourself to the cash to pay.  The atmosphere:  Good enough, the tables are nicely spaced for adequate privacy and it wasn't too loud.   In short, the food was definitely good enough, but the lack of service knocks it down a star."}
{"text":"I agree with Neil.  People, you don't expect fancy decor and personalized service at the Pho restaurant because you're paying $4.50.   Be my guest and shell out the extra money and get the service. I care about the food and it's consistently solid here.  The Pho is among the best and fresh. A deep broth. Great meal for great value."}
{"text":"Ordered pho, service is quick. The broth is ok, not as tasty as others. I did not feel the broth was hot enough. The disappointing part is the rice noodles they use. They are the flat wide noodles which were too soft and mushy as if they overcooked them. Did not taste authentic."}
{"text":"Some people seem to be reviewing the Spadina location.  To avoid confusion, there are multiple locations.  This is the one at Gerrard, near Broadview.  Really, it's a fairly standard Vietnamese restaurant.  You'll hear some people call it \"Train\", and they have pictures of trains on the wall.  Xe Lua means \"Train\" in Vietnamese.  The food is average.  I wouldn't say the quality of the meat is particularly high, to be honest.  But if you want a noodle dish that is good enough, cheap, and fast - this place will definitely do.  It's always under $10, and it's very fast.  It feels a bit dirty, particularly downstairs in the washroom.  Of course, that describes most Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to in Toronto.  If there were an upscale place, I'd probably pay a bit more to go there.  Come to think of it, I shall make it a mission to find one."}
{"text":"A recipe for disaster = MSG filled pho soup base + thick \"ho fun\" noodles + non-existent beefy broth flavour. Really, an insult for pho lovers like me.  Though, I did give this restaurant another shot with their rice dishes. Ordered the rice with pork chops, steamed egg, shredded pig skin ($6.50). It came loaded with the shredded pig skin, a bite size steamed (burnt) egg, and a small piece of pork chop. And it was loaded with so much rice.   Never coming back from such an underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"I really like 110 (pho with brisket, tripe, tendon) and the fried spring rolls (with minced meat and taro).  But be warned, on one ocassion, the rare beef pho gave me food poisoning (as well as my brother and mother who I shared it with). Most recently, I found a hair in my soup."}
{"text":"All about the broth and nothing should be added when eating pho. I was looking for everything to throw in my bowl. If you like instant pho in a package, then go ahead and eat that because this is worst than that."}
{"text":"I love this place when craving pho, wonton soup with shrimp dumplings or BBQ chicken on rice. My husband loves their coconut frozen shakes. This place is cheap with large portions and has also improved with their decor after renovating."}
{"text":"I was starving the other day, and recovering from a cold, so in the mood for soup and noodles.  I ordered Pho (rare beef and tripe), and fried spring rolls.  My bf ordered wontons with rice noodles and a vermicelli.  He was starving.  It looks clean, and had the green \"pass\"  in the window.  It did the job."}
{"text":"Came here after being recommended by a friend that this was one of the top pho places in Toronto. I went at 4pm and there was no line and we were able to be seated quickly. I ordered the 102 Large which came out to be only $10 including tax (super cheap!) The pho was okay, serving size was expected, and I didn't think there was anything special about their service. I went to the Xe Lua restaurant in Thornhill and found the pho to be a lot better than this restaurant. So while it was cheap and fast to get, I would not recommend if you are looking to get quality pho in the downtown area."}
{"text":"Service: Below average at best. Walking in we were not greeted at all and had to ASK for menus. 45 minutes after taking our orders, we asked where our food was: apparently they lost our ticket. With no apology whatsoever, they continued with business. Food came out very quickly afterwards. This mix-up may not happen often, but the poor service and lousy staff are consistent.   Food: Decent food, this is what we come here for. It is well priced and tasty. Pho is classic here.   Decor: Typical restaurant. Average in terms of cleanliness. The restaurant is located upstairs."}
{"text":"I have fond memories of these guys, this place sorta grew up with me. They were one of the original pioneers of pho in this great city and I do credit them for the pho movement and really popularizing Vietnamese cuisine here. During the glory days, there were close a dozen locations across the GTA. I was pho-ing with these guys all through highschool and college. Lunches, random afternoons, dinners, latenight snack, after clubbing, too drunk to remember..etc there were a million reasons to eat pho back then it seemed. It's amazing to see there are still a few of these hanging around town. Just on memories and gratitude alone I should be giving these guys 5 stars but the reality is there's just way too many better options in the city now. Which is amazing to say the least.  The broth is standard; nice flavourful broth with good amounts of noodles and decent cuts of meat. What was once unique and special is now typical and ordinary as the pho standards have been raised significantly. The noodles are done well; slightly al dente. This is a solid bowl of pho that won't knock your socks off but considering that this part of town has such a depressing collection of pho places... these guys a pretty solid when compared to what is around."}
{"text":"It's pretty sad that a lot of the pho places around this neighbourhood aren't exactly amazing.  Xe Lua however, opened up a little while ago bringing some new flavour and life into the area.  In my opinion it's not the best, but at least it's a step in the right direction.  First thing to note is that it's next to a high school.  So if you're going on weekdays around lunch, be warned that it'll be crammed with little kids and you'll be struggling to find a seat.  Other warning is that the parking lot in this plaza is absolutely terrible.  There may be about 20 spots in total for the whole plaza, and the nearest legal parking is probably a 5 minute walk away.  Xe Lua serves their pho with fresh rice noodles.  It's a little bit odd because they're a lot softer than the normal dry noodles, but as a note you can ask for dry noodles if you want (however I didn't really like them when I ordered them).    The portions at Xe Lua here are pretty big, so be warned.  I think they skip the medium on their menu and go straight to large and extra large.  Their ingredients are pretty fresh and quality so at least that part is pretty good.  The food here isn't too bad, however I would probably say that this place is highly chinese influenced.  I reminds me more of rice noodle soup, vietnamese style...  Anywho, I'm glad that there's another place in the neighbourhood, but I'm still looking for a better place a little bit closer =/.  Would I come back?  Yup, but only because it's the best one close by."}
{"text":"Vietnamese pho!! That's the specialty. Food is served quickly and the portion sizes are huge. Also good for rice and vermicelli-based dishes, as well as Asian appetizers and sweet drinks.  Their order form makes it easy to specify a variety of items or order for an entire group without ambiguity (compared to taking orders verbally). I love how this restaurant repeatedly accommodates our groups of 10 to 20 people with ease."}
{"text":"Service : 2.5 / 5 Environment : 2.5 / 5 Food & Drinks : 3.5 / 5 Price : 3  Overall rating : 11.5 / 20  Comments - first off, this place is really hard to get too by car, due to road islands situated around the plaza and the intersection that it's facing.  - this place gets packed on weekend, so be prepared to wait a bit if you come during prime time (6ish - 8ish) - food was good, alot of variety on the menu. - I think this place is a bit under-staffed, 2 waiters managing over 20+ tables."}
{"text":"I come here once in awhile . But when i do iam always satisfied.i 've tried a few of their pho dishes . And always finished them looking for more. What got me were the awsome spring rolls"}
{"text":"Used to love this restaurant but after my meal today I won't be coming back. I ordered the vermicelli bowl with minced shrimp, beef balls and BBQ chicken. The dish came out in under 5 minutes. It was lukewarm, clearly pre-cooked. The noodles were an overcooked, soggy mess. It was like the chef left them in 5 minutes too long. The chicken was fatty and hard; it had clearly been sitting out. The minced shrimp was soggy and filled with oil. The free tea was fine, so I guess they got that right.   The wait staff are standard for a Vietnamese restaurant (I.e. They could care less; this is normal in these places)   Xe Lua used to be my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. I guess that's that."}
{"text":"Food is average. The price is decent so it's still a good deal.   The service is super slow.  I've been here 4-5 times at different days and times. Always slow. So if you have time then you are fine.  If you're in a hurry then go to the one downstairs next door."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I's go-to place for a late night dinner! We've been coming here for years now and have never had a bad experience; it may not be amazing or anything, but the consistently good food, reasonable prices, and fast service keep us coming back. Street parking is also super convenient and free after 9pm.  Their menu is extensive and we've liked everything we've tried so far. Their pho is great and on par with what you'd find at other Vietnamese restaurants in the city, but my personal favourite was always the curry chicken w/ rice vermicelli soup (217) - large, tender pieces of chicken in a deliciously flavourful curry noodle soup, yum! After I stopped eating chicken, I could still get my curry fix with the curry shrimp w/ bread (235) and they have quite a few vegetarian options as well, including the vegetarian spring rolls & vermicelli (908). Portions on all of their dishes are also very generous and give great bang for your buck. In terms of drinks, I would definitely recommend the tea w/ condensed milk (001) - but get it hot because ice dilutes the drink a lot.   Overall, a solid choice for Vietnamese food in the Chinatown area, especially if you're looking for some late night eats!"}
{"text":"It's a crisp sunny wintery Saturday afternoon and i've decided to treat myself with a visit to my favorite Pho spot in Toronto : Bach Yen. Sadly it was closed for the day, not sure why, but luckily i had not paid for parking yet and the itch for Pho was strong so i started to look around for some options.  The choice seemed to be between this place and Pho House which is across the street from it.  It looked busier so i chose it. Going in I did not know it was a chain restaurant. Honestly, it does not look like one. It has all the trappings of a family run business with the oddities to show someone self decorated with the cheapest garage sale items they could buy.  In this case Train paintings. There are train paintings all over the walls so while i'm waiting for my pho i start to wonder if Vietnam is renowned for trains? does it have a great train system? was the chef/owner in the train business?  Luckily, the Pho didn't take long to come. Portions were average considering the cost is higher than the competition. The Bone Broth was clean .. not too salty not too greasy.. light and fragrant with subtle hints of star anise and maybe cloves. The meat quantity was average but the noodle quantity was on the higher end. They serve the pho will green chillies as part of the fixings and that was a nice added touch. It was one of those all i need is to bury my head in a bowl of pho days - so I didn't try anything else. Slightly nicer seating plus the train pictures and it does take credit cards (over$10) if that is important to you. Overall the Pho is on par so i'm not switching loyalties anytime soon. It also wasn't memorable enough that I would not try out Pho House the next time Bach is closed."}
{"text":"If you can't think of somewhere to go then this is a good place to check out.  Its usually about 70 % full every time I visit and never had to wait for seats. I usually get the rice or the vermicelli dishes with chicken or pork or beef or spring rolls depending on what I am craving at the time.   Its not amazing but it's not a let down either. Prices are fair and portion sizes are reasonable."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck. You'll leave the restaurant stuffed for a little less than the amount of money you'd spend on a meal at mcdonalds if you split with a friend. Pho is fresh, fast and delicious. Really nice atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho, but I havent compared it with any others in Toronto"}
{"text":"My go to!! Love the staff here! Tough as nails, but all soft and incoherent at best... Maybe because, I'm a wee bit tipsy when I'm here at 3am lol"}
{"text":"Wow. Had the worst rare beef pho in my life. The broth was extremely salty and the meat was not only thin but very dry. I couldn't even bring myself to finish my bowl after pouring water to attempt to ease the saltiness. Would never return again and definitely not recommend."}
{"text":"Don't expect good service, but good value/portions for the money. I wish they used proper rice noodles though.... It should be the thin dried ones so that there is some chewy texture. Instead, they use Chinese ones that are thick and too mushy for use in soup. And why must these places all use so much MSG?   Their washroom is in the basement accessible by stairs only, so please be aware if you are handicapped or caring for a toddler. The toilets also flush hard but not properly. :("}
{"text":"Great service! Authentic and menu prices are reasonable. Highly recommended if you're  looking for good Vietnamese food in Richmond hill."}
{"text":"The pho here is pretty good. Probably the best in China town.  However, the best thing is actually the CURRY. I highly recommend getting the beef brisket curry, it comes with some french bread.  Absolutely delicious, extremely cheap, AND open at 3AM after the clubs.  Obviously don't expect amazing service. It's a low budget / high turnover operation."}
{"text":"I have been to 2 other Pho Train and I think this one is the worst of all three. Had Satay and fresh rolls. Both dishes are ok. Neither tasted fresh. The egg noodles in the satay were tough. The whole place has a dirty feel. The other two Trains are much better than this one, but it does what it needs to do, be open post club hours and fill the post drinking cravings."}
{"text":"Okay - so I'm quite picky when it comes to pho now due to the amazing pho in the KW region at Pho Dau Bo.  I'm boycotting Pho 88 now due to its MSG filled pho, and now I'm going to boycott this place as well.  The soup was extremely oily and the noodles were extremely wide (like, wth?).  Granted, it's cheap.  But still, there has to be better pho in the uptown region... C'mon people!"}
{"text":"Very cheap that's why the quality is very low. Taste aweful.  We didn't even finish our food.  Standard pho chicken and special beef. And not fresh salad - roll.   Need improvement a lot, and please do not use that much MSG"}
{"text":"My favorite Pho place in Toronto!!   Reasons: -Quick service - never a wait -Delicious Pho -Big Portions -Cheap  I have been addicted to this place over the past month..l think I've eaten here at least once a week. Perfect spot for a quick lunch, relaxed dinner, or take-out on a cold night when you want comfort food.   And it's SO cheap! $7 for a Small Pho (which is NOT small, it's big!)   Don't expect pleasant servers though, sometimes they are a bit rude especially when it's busy. But I mean....for the speed of service and the price it doesn't matter haha"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pho, not bad not the best either. I usually come here for the pho only, I've had the rice dishes here also they aren't so bad either. Avoid their vermicelli, noodles are served cold. Just ruins the dish completely in my opinion.   One thing I really dislike about this place is that it doesn't feel authentic, Majority of their staff are  Chinese and they play Chinese music time to time besides radio. Just think of the place as a Chinese run Vietnamese shop. Service here can be at times upright obnoxious, and more like lack of service despite having lots of staff on hand.   This place does open up late on the weekends and can get quite busy here after 12am. Only bonus here is getting reasonably price pho after a night out at the bar or club, there's still an infamous video on YouTube with a fight breaking out on Halloween, worth a watch. Pretty funny."}
{"text":"Just a decent Pho restaurant that opens till very late so it's popular among people enjoying a night out in the city.  The restaurant is located upstairs and it didn't seem like they have an elevator to make it accessible for everyone. The environment felt kinda greasy and you could pretty much look into the kitchen if you sit close enough to the counter.  I didn't find the food to be anything special when I ordered a Large House Special Pho to share it with a friend. It was enough to fill both of us because there were a lot of noodles, but definitely could use more meats compared to some other Pho restaurants that I've been to. The soup contained way too much MSG for my liking, that I kept feeling very thirsty after I finished my meal.  Would not return again."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Pho in town. Generous portion and very tasty. However, don't expect too much from service. Employees always look grumpy and tired. Great place for cheap, fast and late meal."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of this restaurant using thick noodles for their pho. Using the thicker rice noodles is more Chinese than Vietnamese. It's supposed to be the thinly sliced rice noodles. That's the reason why I haven't been going to this restaurant for many years. Is there even an authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Toronto? It seems like all of them are Chinese-influenced. It's a shame."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for their Tomato-base Beef Brisket pho.  The prices are very reasonable and they're open late. Really not much to complain about. It isn't the best pho joint in town, but you definitely get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Been here a few times previously.  As the other reviews mentioned, the pho sucked (thick flat rice noodles, crappy broth, etc).  No love for Xe Lua unfortunately."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this restaurant late on a Friday night with the invite from a friend I hadn't seen in a couple of months. It was my first time having Vietnamese food. It was good. I punked out though and got a fried rice type of dish out of fear of the pho, lol :(. My friend got some curry based type of soup that he gave me some of and it was delicious. I'm going to have it one day when I will inevitably end up there starving early in the morning. However I should mention, my friend couldn't remember the name of this soup so it took two other servers and a lot of pointing and over exaggerating before we could figure it out. You would think I would remember the name of it but alas, I don't. If you're looking for customer service fair warning: this is not the place. The servers aren't really looking to talk to you. Each menu item has a number. After you decide on what you want you are expected to write the numbers on a provided notepad and leave it at the edge of your table for a server to grab on their way by. That's it. No further interaction. Like I said they did help us figure out the soup but it's not standard practice here.  I tried some steak type thingy that was really good. My rice was the expected fried rice and went well with the chicken skewers type thing my friend encouraged me to get. There was complimentary green tea that I sipped on all night, which was nice. This is a late night spot that's decent and good for conversation, and if you live that type of exciting life sobering up after a night of bad decisions."}
{"text":"Decades ago, there was this rumour that circulated, that made me avoid their pho like the plague. A few years later, after a late night I found myself here eating their pho.  It was pretty good, the broth was my favourite, not too oily and nicely seasoned. Since then I've been coming back!  I really like their spring rolls, which have never disappointed.  In addition to ordering pho, I sometimes order Phuc Kien seafood noodle soup, which is mixed yellow noodle and vermicelli with seafood, and a crispy shrimp cracker to top it off.  Their food quality I find is the same at all times of the day, from morning to late night.  The prices are reasonable, and the service is very fast.  Heads up, the place can get pretty packed on a club night (Friday and Saturday) after 2 am."}
{"text":"Xe lua's food quality is pretty consistent.  Pho and rice dishes are solid.  They renovated around 4-5 years ago and it only took about 2 months after for the place to look run down again.  Get a table as far as you can from the service counter.  You can smell the toilet from there.  Not too appetizing.  Best bet is order take out."}
{"text":"This place deserves 1 star for the following reasons:  1) Their menu consists of about 330 items -- that is NEVER a good sign of being a great Vietnamese restaurant  2) My bowl of pho consisted of Chinese wide rice noodles, not the thinner rice noodles used for pho  3) Even with over 300 items on their menu, they said they were out of bun rieu (minced pork and crab in a tomato-based soup) -- I wonder what else they were out of...  4) They use \"lai fun\" (thick Chinese-style vermicelli) in their fresh spring rolls, instead of the thin vermicelli we are accustomed to seeing  5) My cousin ordered a simple coconut juice drink (probably out of a can), which didn't arrive at our table until halfway through our meal  If this doesn't scream bad Vietnamese restaurant, I don't know what does.  What's sad is that Xe Lua has five other restaurants all over the Toronto area.  Coming to Xe Lua helped solidify the fact that Vietnamese cuisine in the Bay Area cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"This use to be my goto spot. I went today and they jacked up the prices, cut the portions and when I asked about it they claim they gave me more, and demanded tips.  Guess I'll find another spot to get my fix."}
{"text":"As a Viet, I could say this is one of THE WORST PHO I've tasted in my life. Fragrance and flavours are not right. Their noodles aren't even, and food quality seemed old. Service and atmosphere are just borderline bearable to alright."}
{"text":"Good location. Good size. Good quality n quantity of beef. Lousy lemon grass chicken, no flavor, not seasoned enough. Good price. Service pending on which server.  Some male servers are very nice and attentive.  Some female servers look very unhappy with their job."}
{"text":"I used to go to Xe Lua in Spadina Chinatown often, as it is nice to have pho after Pho Hung's opening hours. However, the one in Chinatown tends to be very dirty, and sometimes there is a really strong, unpleasant smell associated with that place.   I therefore go to Xelua in the east Chinatown. It is often less crowded. This place is clean, and the service, mighty fast.   The broth was delicious, but I have to say that it was really lacking in green onion and cilantro. The beef was good, but expect the beef balls to be much smaller than Hung of Xelua downtown.  The Satay is also great. A mice kick and yet not too spicy.  Still a great choice for Viet food."}
{"text":"Hits the spot for those after-club nights!  Not sure why this place always feels so grimy and smells a little weird, but this is my fave spot to get Chicken Pho (Pho Gat?). You know when you go to pho places and sometimes the soup smells off or it tastes like plastic? The broth here is pretty good, and the chicken is not too dry. I used to get the beef house special but it's way too greasy for my liking now. I've also tried the avocado milkshake here and it's not too bad. Definitely not fresh or anything but it's not bad.   It's usually a quick meal since pho doesn't take too long to make and they have tons of servers, which I appreciate.   Hard to say what makes a 5-star bowl of pho but for the dining experience overall, I give Xe Lua 3 stars (but that won't keep me from coming back, this is definitely still one of my go-to spots)."}
{"text":"There's my baby...sort of...  Xe Lua is back! I knew it was just the cook!  FOOD So I ordered my exact same dish the last time I was here and it was a lot better. There was actually meat in my dish this time.  There was A LOT less MSG (thank goodness!).    My soup was only warm and this time they actually took a lot longer to give us our food that usual. Kind of weird.  ENVIRONMENT What was awful is that the place was freezing cold. B/c it was chilly outside, as soon as someone opened the door, a gust of cold air swept through the place.   They should have turned on the heat...or at least given us HOT broth."}
{"text":"Got two bowls of vermicelli,  very good taste wise and service was quick.  Good spot for a quick cheap lunch"}
{"text":"I ordered take out this week and noticed the discrepancy in what was written on the take out menu and what was charged to me when I ordered. I brought this to the attention of the manager and said that this is because the menu is old. In my confusion, I asked him, didn't you just open? He said yes but he brought over a stockpile of old menus from another restaurant. That was the extent of the conversation. Poor business ethics.  I will not be returning not recommending this place to anyone. Food tasted average, portions were small in comparison to what was being charged."}
{"text":"I would give it less if I could. While waiting to be seated, I saw an employee knock over a large bowl of cut up lemons from the counter. He just scope them back into the bowl & put them back on the counter. The same ones they expect you to garnish your food with!! Walked right out, yuck!"}
{"text":"The post-clubbing 3am pho spot.    $5 cab away from Easy, with judgey, middle-aged Asian men perpetually hanging outside the restaurants.  I like the standard rare beef one, but also the brisket/tendons/tripe pho as well.  The menu #'s are too much for my then-inebriated brain to remember, but pretty sure everything on the menu would taste delicious considering people would usually go there after a night of dancing and round of drinking.  Standard pho prices, worth a go if you're ever near the area"}
{"text":"Started off great but the Pho has really deteriorated recently - the soup is white and murky and the noodles are gooey."}
{"text":"There's no way around this place - people either love it or hate it.  There's no in between.  Clearly I come in on the \"love\" side of things.  It's great pho, and it's super cheap.  Some people talk broth, and noodle type - and that's fine.  I'd suggest coming here just once and figuring out if it's for you.  It's my favourite place on the strip these days.  The waiters get you your food, then leave you alone.  There's always room.  I love looking out over Spadina from the second storey.    Even when you're done eating they'll keep refilling your tea, and never hover and make you feel like it's time to go.  I might suggest wearing a bib though.  So many shirts have died here as a result of my own foolish oily spill."}
{"text":"This is my default pho restaurant.  It's quick, really quick, the service is excellent, and the pho is consistently delicious.  I like this location way better than the one on Spadina where they don't care about service at all.  My friend has even told me that she once came when the restaurant was about to close and they prolonged the closing just to serve her one dish.  They even re-fired up the grill.  The fruit smoothie is really good too!  The only thing is sometimes I feel dirty when I sit too close to the wall.  The wall needs a bit of cleaning or something to make it feel cleaner.  And I'm scared to go downstairs to use their washroom but I guess that's just me nit picking."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying this restaurant experience literally made me write my first Yelp review. Went here with my girlfriend, stood at the doorway waiting awkwardly for a server who just pointed at a table in the corner and carried on doing whatever he was doing. We sat down and wrote our orders down and had to wave someone down to hand in our orders. We waited ~40 minutes while customers who had come after us got their orders promptly. We waved yet another waiter down who told us they would check on our order. Minutes later they tell us the order was forgotten and we saw the waiter who took our order being scolded behind us. Finally after more than an hour of waiting, we received our pho which was fine but nothing special. No apology was issued for this error. During our meal, a homeless man came in and went table to table asking for change. My girlfriend felt very uncomfortable as he approached our table and asked us for money during our meal. The servers noticed but did not do anything about this.  After we finished our meals, we, once more, had to wave down a waiter to grab the bill. We were told to go up to the counter to pay. We went to the counter and the girl there was making a milkshake or smoothie, completely ignoring us. After what seemed like minutes, she finally finished and turned to us and asked us what table we were sitting at. We paid the bill in cash and as we were collecting our change the girl gave us a dirty look and asked us if we knew that the tip wasn't included. Both my girlfriend and I were so taken aback by this. We left 50 cents tip even though they clearly deserved none whatsoever. Finally to top the night off, as we were walking away from the counter, I heard the girl calling us cheap idiots in mandarin Chinese to another coworker. I would give negative stars to this establishment if I could. Would never come back."}
{"text":"Been to the location on Spadina for late night Phô. Tried this location.....terrible!  Service is terrible. I felt like they didn't appreciate business or being in their shop....like what does this white woman know?Phô was lacking in flavours. Spring roll was blah.My husband felt sick afterwards... I can't say definitively was the food but it was probably the food."}
{"text":"I ever only come here in the middle of the night after a night out because they close at 5am. If I'm craving pho during the day, sober and fully awake, I would not come here. It taste better at night. Their broth isn't the greatest but they use fresh noodles which is awesome."}
{"text":"I liked the food here, large portions at a reasonable price. The staff were attentive and the tea  here tasted fantastic."}
{"text":"Pho anywhere in Richmond Hill is usually quite terrible. This here was the worst Pho I've had in at least 2 years. They used \"ho fun\" noodles which is way too thick. And the soup did not taste right. The meat was fresh, so I will at least give them credit for that. Their shrimp rolls tasted fine as well. But Pho is the main staple dish here and it didn't taste right. Don't ever have Pho in Richmond Hill - make the drive to Scarborough or North York if you really need to satisfy your pho cravings."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from here for the first time as an alternative to Vic Hong at Bayview/Major Mac plaza. The pho is decent! I was most impressed at how accurate they were with my order: I asked them to leave out parsley for one of the others and take out tendon for the other order. Naturally I left a tip."}
{"text":"This place is own by Chinese they don't really speak Vietnamese at all. Their pho was okay but one thing that I didn't really like about it was their main dish. Their house noodles ( Pho Dac Biet) didn't have beef ball in it.. The only good things about this restaurant is that you open late and they take debit lol."}
{"text":"The pho is good at this local spot, good size for the price, been there a couple of times. The fresh rolls are delicious, I get them every time.  I give it a 3 star rating because of the service I receive every time I go. Needless to say I go back for the convenience in location."}
{"text":"After waiting about 20 minutes for someone to come take our empty bowls and give us our bill, they came after us out the restaurant for a tip. Absolutely ridiculous. Why should I leave a tip for unsatisfying service? Never returning.  Update: We returned for a desperate meal and found hair in the pho AND an ALIVE fly in the bean sprout that comes with the pho. Disgusting and disappointed, AGAIN."}
{"text":"Such an old restaurant n a renovation is a must. The food was average at this price range."}
{"text":"Food is meh, prices are good though. I usually just come here for the cheap beer."}
{"text":"PHO LUNCH!  I usually come here for my pho fix because the service is quick, plenty of space, and great value. It has been a LONG time since I last went for pho, so I was like, why not, let's head there for lunch. This review is for lunch only. Please look below for helpful hints/tips which will definitely help you!   Ordered: 101 Special Large $7.75 - special beef noodle soup 3/5 - this is usually my go-to, but I felt like the quality decreased from the last time I went - still a decent meal under $10 after tax  Overall: - service was quick. When I sat down, tea had arrived in less than 1 minute along with the menus - was quite surprised that there were many tables available at 1:00pm, maybe because people heard I was going and they wanted to avoid me?   Helpful hints/tips - Address: 254 Spadina Avenue (closest major interesection is Dundas/Spadina - walk south on Spadina and go to the 2nd floor) - Food Prices:  1) Pho: $6.50 small, $7.75 Large, $10 Extra Large 2) Vermicelli: $7.50-49.50 3) Rice Dishes: $8-$9 - Methods of Payment: Cash, Visa, Mastercard, Debit ($10 minimum for credit card and/or debit purchases) - Good for large parties: Yes, about 8 booths which seats about 4 people, 8 big tables that can accomodate groups of 8 or more, 8 tables for 2 people - Security: If you want to feel safe while eating, there are about 4 security cameras  - Environment: Casual, don't need to dress fancy to eat there. Christmas lights are around the walls - Parking: Side parking on the street if you can find parking spot (metered parking). There is a parking lot almost right across the street"}
{"text":"Cheap and decent. Usually go for their special sized pho bowls to fill me up. They're one of my late night eats if I'm stuck downtown.  Service by the servers needs improvement though..."}
{"text":"Yum!  Feeling like vietnamese soup? You've hit the right spot! Want crispy fresh spring rolls? Welcome to satisfaction!  Over the last few years, everytime I've been in Toronto my friend has taken me to this place. Each time they've been consistent in their quality and flavor of food. They have a great selection of soups and meals, and all the food is prepared at a resonable speed. And the prices are very reasonable!   Is it the most beautiful looking interior in the world? Nah. But then I've seen a whole worse. It's fairly clean but could still use some work. The only real issue is the service. Last time I was there I think there was only one girl serving the entire store, and, she was over worked and extremely disinterested.   Go here for the food!! If you're feeling a craving for Vietnamese soup, you need to get your butt down here!  (Although if you're looking for a first date, I'd recommend somewhere else)"}
{"text":"This is the place I go to all the time for pho, cause its close to my house and I like the  broth.  Also, they give you a choice of thick or thin noodles.  I love the thick noodles and other pho restaurants don't give you that option.  Noodles and beef are so good, nice portion size.  My nieces love this pho place the most too.  The décor is nice since they upgraded recently, and is spacious too cause the restaurant is long.  So why did I give only a 3?  I don't like the wait staff at all.  I don't know why its so hard for them, but there is always something wrong.  At least 2 times we sat down but was not giving tea or a menu, one time I got tired and walked over to pho 88.  Another 2 times, they didn't give us tea.  Sometimes the staff seems occupied talking to each other or reading a magazine.  And yeah, I just love it when i sit down first and they serve another customer that came in later first."}
{"text":"The Choo Choo Train, as my friends and I call it, just ain't the same anymore. Ever since it moved upstairs into the larger, but blander space, the food has gone down hill. I went in for lunch the other day since my friend who used to live here had chosen it for old time's sake.   This lunch was actually within 12 hours of my late night visit to another pho joint just around the corner, so I opted for some snacks instead. The deep fried wontons were just that - way deep fried. It would've been nice if they were more crispy and less borderline chewy from all the oil. The shrimp salad rolls were trusty as they have always been. One thing that Xe Lua has always done well though, are their shakes. My first ever avocado shake proved to be super creamy with just the right hint of sweetness.   My friend really enjoyed his ridiculously large bowl of pho. I generally don't have that much to complain about when I order pho either, but I did notice that the plate of bean sprouts and basil accoutrements were much less lively than the ones at the restaurant the previous evening.  I guess it was a busy lunch, but the large dining room is hardly ever less than half full, so I often wonder aloud why the service is so non-existent sometimes. We had to wait forever to even get a sheet to order with and basically gave up on getting our tea pot refilled.   On this last visit, I also witnessed a pretty funny thing. When another patron wearing a red shirt was leaving the restaurant, he was mistaken for a server and was flagged down by a frustrated lady trying to pay her bill. It was awkward and hilarious when he revealed that he didn't work there."}
{"text":"I see a lot if mediocre reviews for this place. I'll admit there are better pho places out there but this isn't a bad spot. I'm no stranger to pho restaurants either. One thing about this place, at least for me, is that they're consistent with the soup. I find a lot of other places are varying in taste depending on the visit. This place is the same each visit (about 5 for me). I don't often eat anything other than soup and noodles from these places so i can't comment on the other dishes they offer.  The price is pretty standard as far as pho places go, small soups starting at $6 and only a few bucks more to up the sizes. Most people would be fine with a small.   As mentioned in earlier reviews, the location is a pain unless you're already travelling south on Bayview, but this isn't a deal breaker for going here.  I will keep coming here for my pho and iced coffee woth condensed milk!"}
{"text":"I've been to lots of Xu Lua's all over the city into suburbs, as my entire dragon boat crew would eat here after practice. That's cramming 20 people together and getting out food at roughly that same time- challenge but that don't blink a bit.  Experience can change on your waitress or what you order but it's not always as bad as the reviews seem.   Solid menu choices: Drink: avocado milkshake & Vietnamese coffee Appy: skewers, deep fried tofu cubes, shrimp on sugar cane Pho: beef (pretty standard), seafood noodles has some msg but not overboard Dessert: grass jelly or red bean ice works   Tip: you can get extra pho herb toppings just ask nicely   How to get here is a challenge! You must be coming south bound on Bayview to turn into plaza, otherwise no left turn signs will get you!  Great for groups they can move tables over together fast  as mentioned. This is not fine dining and yah you can get some attitude but you have no idea how rough their day has been of if they've been here all day to be fair.   Never been sick after eating here or running for water afterwards due to msg."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a handful of times over 5 years and they haven't disappointed me. speedy service and everything tastes fresh.  I normally get their durian milkshake which is never watered-down and their grilled porkchops on rice. I like the fact that it comes with 2 pieces of porkchops with a bit of fat - to me it gives it more flavour.  I also recently discovered their \"fish in clay pot\" dish (called ca kho to in Vietnamese) - and it is so amazing! probably one of my favourite Vietnamese dishes for the taste and its' presentation - serves in a clay pot like the name! best to eat this with white rice as it's supposed to be on the salty side  good place for any meal of the day - service does not falter"}
{"text":"Best pho in all of Toronto. Don't even bother going downtown! Not a big fan of the bubble teas or smoothies, but it's not a bubble tea shop! Chicken pho is good, the curry beef brisket soup is amazing, spring rolls are the best hands down, the chicken skewers (sorry I don't know the name) are yummy, and the traditional \"chicken breast with pork and rice\" for $8 is soooooooo good.  You'll leave here feeling contempt with life and you'll want to return."}
{"text":"Xe Lua, commonly called Train, is a great spot for pho!   It's a relatively new restaurant, but it will instantly be a staple for your weekly restaurant rotations. The spacious interior is clean and bright and you are seated almost immediately, especially during lunch hours.   Pho is their speciality, but they have some great soups and rice dishes as well. My favourite item here is the Tom yum soup broth with fish and vermicelli noodles. It's quite spicy, but very, very delicious.   The dish comes out piping hot and is garnished with coriander. More recently when I visited, I couldn't find this exact item, so it just opted for the soup version with no noodles. Still tastes just as great!   Unfortunately they don't have many vegetarian or fish options, but I do always enjoy my Tom yum soup and can't complain about the service or price!   A great choice if you're in the area and wanting some authentic pho!"}
{"text":"...I've had better.... The spring rolls were horrid and the soup in the pho has too much msg. Also this place is run by Chinese people so it's not legit Vietnamese food. The only thing I enjoyed was my tea. Would not come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I dine at this restaurant once in a while when we crave pho. Since it's close by. I personally like the thin rice noodle, but for some reason they serve the thick flat noodle (like the Chinese fried rice noodle). I don't mind thick flat rice noodles for my fried noodle dishes but no for pho. That's why I always ask for the thin rice noodle before ordering.  Otherwise their food is up to par and I would recommend this restaurant to those that are seeking a new viet spot to check out."}
{"text":"I have to say I LOVE Xe Lua for Pho!! This place is always busy and there is good reason. They have a huge selection of Pho and other viet dishes to order. I'm a consistent fan of the chicken pho and find it to be the best in the city (I have tried a LOT of pho places!). The broth is amazing and the quality of the chicken is good, in comparison to other pho places out there.   For me, a great bowl of Pho lies in the broth, and I tend to favour this more than the noodles. Everytime we go and I devour my broth, I am left with a ton of noodles. Without hesitation and without charging me extra, they always fill up my bowl, either for eat-in or take-out, with extra broth. The portions are generous, and you can order from small ranging to extra large bowls of pho. They are very generous with the noodles, as well as with the other trimmings in Pho.   Among my favourites here are the chicken pho and the rare beef pho. The avocado shakes are also really delish, and a great accompaniment to any meal. The chicken fried rice with pineapple is also totally addictive, and we usually end up ordering this as a side. Open til late hours of the morning, this is a definite bonus, and keeps me coming back everytime. The prices are also really reasonable and it's a great spot to hit at any time of day to satiate your pho cravings."}
{"text":"Ask the waitress for the best sandwich and she deadass brought us soup. Then I was trying to pay and get it to go and buddy steals it from my table. Now I have no lunch today and I'm gonna starve and die."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a long time. I find the soups are getting smaller portions noodles price are higher but the food smaller most likely will go to Scarborough worth the drive I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Vietnamese franchises. You always know what you're getting, food is always good. I get the chicken and rice or Pho, never disappointed. Serving sizes are great and if anything you can always order an extra side. Service is great, but if you don't want to eat there take out is also a good option."}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times, always inebriated.  I like stuffing my face after a night of drinking, and this place hits the spot.  Big selection of food to choose from and at good prices.   I would like to give this place a try sober to see if my opinion changes."}
{"text":"its your typical pho restaurant. good prices, good value, and good pho. the only real things you might nitpick on is service or cleanliness or something. but otherwise, this restaurant has been around for many many years and they're doing things proper."}
{"text":"I know this has nothing to do with the food but I want to mention the location of this place is horrible- it's very difficult to enter because you can only enter whilst going south on Bayview.  I decided to order pick up because my favorite pho place is quite a distance away (at Keele & Langstaff) so I tried them out for the first time, and the noodles were disgustingly soggy, like they were pre-cooked way too much and the broth was so boring and they only gave me one lime when I asked for extra overall it was bullshit and I won't ever go back.  They seemed really nice though... I guess????"}
{"text":"After clubbing, most of my friend disperse to either Pho 88 or this place, which is actually called \"train head\" in Chinese. For some reason, I always end up at Pho 88 instead.    I visited here for the first time this weekend and was a bit surprised as to why this is one of the go-to places for pho. It isn't bad, but isn't the greatest. They do, however, provide plenty of noodles and beef in your bowl.   Now, about their bowl, it's not your typical large bowl opening, but their small bowl is pretty narrow and, you know when you add all the basil in your food but you don't eat basil?, you have a hard time actually getting noodle without the basil because of the tiny circumference.  I was also irritated by the fact that when I ordered a small iced coffee with milk, they didn't give me a plate to place the filter when i had to take it off the mug and pour the coffee into the glass of ice. Needless to say, the area in front of me became a caffeinated mess.  All of this sort of points to the overall experience of the restaurant. It's not so bad that you'd vow never to come back, but there's just something askew.  A few notes: - by default their noodles are wider than normal pho noodles, if you want normal size noodles, you have to ask for \"thin noodles\" - they do serve cold tea now...according to Vivek S. in one of the June 2011 reviews, it wasnt available, but when I went this weekend, it now is."}
{"text":"The service here was horrible. I sat at a table and did not receive any menus for the longest time. The waiter did acknowledge my entry when I came in, and had told me to sit anywhere. Had to repeatedly ask waiters and waitresses for water and utensils, over and over because they kept forgetting. It came to the point I wasn't sure if they understood. Ordering vermicelli, my food felt it was premade and reheated. The taste was bland, but for the price I believe it was expected. This place would probably be a place I would come back to when I'm drunk so the food doesn't appear as bland and boring."}
{"text":"I remember when I was much younger, when I lived with my parents and every Sunday we would go to Chinatown and do groceries.  Once that was done we would go to Pho Xe Lua and have lunch which mostly consisted of Pho.    Now, on cold days I come with friends and think about how the restaurant change from family dining to a more lucrative student/cheap eats 'cafeteria' now on the second floor of which use to be on the first floor.  The pho did not change thankfully, although not the best in Toronto definitely still trustworthy.  103 rare beef and tripe is my go to, size small with a side of meat--yes you can ask for extra protein for $3 which is amazing!  When in doubt, go for 101 Pho David Biet, the special  where you can have a taste of everything.  The Satay Noodles is pretty good as well if you're in that mood for satay and a kick of spice.    Their spring rolls and fresh rolls are also decent as well."}
{"text":"First time here and I thought it was pretty good. Would definitely come back for some quick pho if in the area. The soup for the pho was good and came with a good amount of meat and noodles. I couldn't even finish a small bowl here. You also get to pick between the thin and thick noodles, and I personally like the thin noodles. Spring rolls were also really tasty. This place is fairly priced. Nothing to really complain about other than their strawberry milkshake/smoothie that just tasted like blended frozen strawberries. Very watered down and has the freezer burn taste. Good service as well when I went."}
{"text":"Great comforting food during a cold winter day.  I ordered the special pho - which usually has tendons in it but they had meat balls instead. I didn't read the menu close enough, but I'd probably mention it for an adjustment next time.   The food was pretty good. The meat were slightly fatty and dry, but I gave most of my meat to my partner anyways (I'm not a huge meat eater).   The broth was pretty good as well. I would say nothing spectacular, but still a really lovely bowl of pho to enjoy on a cold day. :)"}
{"text":"So we just ended up choosing this place because we were in the area. I ordered the seafood pho with transparent noodles. It was OK the broth was tasty. My hubby ordered rare beef pho and my daughters ordered grilled beef/prawn/rice noodles. We ordered a mango salad on the side as well. Everything was OK. Nothing to rave about. Prices were OK. Service was pretty good. The staff were very quick and very polite. Would I go again?... Not sure."}
{"text":"Cheap viet/thai food.  The service is much better than most Chinese owned restaurants.  The decor is also much nicer than several Chinese restaurants in the Richmond Hill/Markham area."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst vietnamese Pho place in the area!!  Please don't bother going there!  Nothing is good there...(at least all the dishes I ordered!) And from my previous reviews you can tell I am not too picky!  There are so many different restaurants choice in this plaza... you will be happy you did not come here!"}
{"text":"I have yet been to a \"Good\" and \"Decent\" Xe Lua Restaurant.  This is the newest location of Xe Lua Restaurant and the experience is just all MEH. From the service and the food, you know how you sometimes has this feeling why am I here?  Special Pho Medium ($6.50) is sizable, perfect portion for lunch. However their use of  Fresh Rice Noodle which is a lot thicker and has this taste that doesn't goes well with the soup. The broth itself though loaded with MSG but I had worse...so it is still passable.  When you are served by a waiter that really care less...never has eye contact and never address you or acknowledge you, I don't think I want to be back!  Menu is extensive, maybe a little too extensive?"}
{"text":"I've come here for over 15 years now, back when it was on the ground floor, back when there was a lot more competition in the area for pho. This place has stood the test of time, probably due to it's quick (although sometimes questionable) service and cheap prices. It is a good bang for buck sort of place.  Speaking of the food though, the pho is below average on my scale. It doesn't taste that appealing and I don't get the normal hints of star anise, coriander pods, or cloves as I'm used to getting. The meat in the pho is decent enough as pho usually uses cheap cuts. What I normally get here is the broken rice with grilled chicken. Their nuoc mam game is on point. The bun is good too. This place can get pretty packed and rowdy after clubbing but the atmosphere is mainly people trying to fill their stomachs with food after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Xe Lua is a chain of Vietnamese restaurants around the city (and, possibly around the world? I saw locations in NYC and Vancouver on Google). For some reason, we just call this place Pho Train, probably because they serve pho and their logo is a train.  And do we ever love Pho Train. There are several great things about this location:  1) It's open 24 hours. So when you are debating if you should get some hangover McDonald's, you can say, \"No, I think I will have delicious pho to help cure this illness\" and it doesn't matter if it's 10 pm or 4 am. Pho Train will be there for you.  2) Speedy service. Your food will generally arrive in about 2 minutes. It's unreal.  3) Delicious milkshakes with tapioca...Mmmm..  4) Oh, right, their pho is actually amazing. The broth totally hits the spot and they have all the usual fixings that you can use to customize the flavour. I love the lime juice and hot sauce, personally.  The only bad thing about this Pho Train location is that it's a popular choice for after the clubs on Richmond Street close.  So if you're going anytime after last call, expect lineups of huge groups of skanky girls and guys in dress shirts and too much cologne.   But, sometimes, you gotta have pho. I've waited before and it was worth it. Pho Train just does it so well."}
{"text":"I've only been to this place for late night pho, after a night of partying. The food is decent for the price ($6 for small pho) but the pho is just mediocre. The noodles are unusually thick, and I usually prefer them thinner. There are definitely better pho places in Toronto, like even Pho Hung just up the street, which I would choose to eat at during the day. Basically what this place has going for it is that it's open late, has cheap prices, and quick service. If you come around 2 AM or later this place usually gets packed, so you may have to wait a little."}
{"text":"There isn't much needed to be said about this place, the pho is excellent - it's comes quickly and the staff is really nice. I also like their black tea bubble tea in the summer and the Vietnamese coffee in the winter."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Didn't give us any prep for the soup. Fresh rolls were not fresh at all. The papaya salad did not have any papaya in it. Will not come back."}
{"text":"I had my first pho experience here on a cold winter night a few years back.  Even though I've seen what else is out there, I still manage to find myself back here at some point.  Each and every time it's wonderful. It's not fancy at all and sometimes you have to hint really hard that you're ready to order.  However, this can be countered by the fact that it's so ridiculously cheap for such a filling meal. Their pho is on point!  The broth is salty and delicious and their noodles are thick - my favorite killer combo! I've been coming here for years and I don't think I'll be stopping anytime soon. One of my definite go-tos! Bonus:  It's open super late!"}
{"text":"I just love their noodle soups, yes, the Pho.  So good I could finish a large order almost mindlessly and blissfully that I just have to be mindful of my slurping.  I'm happy enough that they have improved the flavour and texture from the first time they opened - more infused, refined, meaty, and satisfying.  Don't miss mixing in the basil leaves and lime extracts and happy notes will instantly sing.  The contemporary interior makes it an inviting venue but can be very tight especially when the dinner rush hour sets in.  So just eat and go and come back another time for more.  And with its modest price, who wouldn't.   For a Vietnamese dive-in, its a great addition to my book of go-to places."}
{"text":"Staff are kinda rude. The noise is really loud at night. But the prices are decent given the location. They have great selections and varieties such as the conventional rice dishes and the noodle soups, house specials etc.. But they also have the spring roll dinners and packages you can cook on your own so you get a huge variation of meats and veggies. Great price, and they even give you 10% off if you go often enough (called the VIP discount).  Their soup is some of the best tasting ones I have had in Toronto. It rivals Pho Saigon in my opinion. But this is done at a much cheaper price. The portions are also quite large.."}
{"text":"Hey, ho, let's gooooo! Always love the Pho Train since you pretty much know what you're going to get. The place was a bit hard to get to going north on Bayview because you actually have to turn left at the light and maybe even a U-turn at the light to get here.  Anyway for your those who don't know, Pho Train is practically the Mc Donalds of Pho noodle places so I think you get a pretty consistent meal everytime you eat here.  Staff is pretty friendly here and seems like chinese owned. I think it's probably a pretty popular spot for the locals that live around here. At around 6pm on a Thursday they were about half full with families and stuff.  I got the vermicelli noodles which I recommend if you're not going for the soup noodles (it'll be under the Bún section). I like it because you get a deep fried spring roll, some bbq chicken, and another meat (pork, meatballs, etc) depending which one you choose. Amazing value for $9, and if you're indecisive like me and just want a bit of everything!  Legit place. Will for sure come again. (Kind of like me saying I'd go to McDonald's again sometime in my life) which is not really saying too much at all."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review this place for a while but I always called it train or the pho place we'd go to after clubbing where you gotta walk up the stairs... But I love this place!!!!   I don't get why people gave this place one star cuz of the Chinese wait staff (as opposed to Vietnamese), not being different from other Viet restaurants and bad chicken wings.. YOU'RE AT A PHO RESTAURANT!! A full meal will cost you no more than $10!!! Don't expect so much... Also.. YOU'RE AT A PHO RESTAURANT!!! This isn't turtle jacks or real sports so don't expect good wings..  With that being said.... I always get the beef pho or pork with rice and a fried egg... It's pretty freaking good.. Pho is huge and tons of meat and the pork is moist, just the right amount of sweetness and the egg is still runny.. In all honesty, for the price ($7.99 or something like that) you can't be mad at the staff being Chinese and not Viet... But the best thing about this place is the amount of lime they give you.. I like a lot of lime in my pho.. Like, more than an entire lime.. When I ask for extra lime, most places will give me 4 extra pieces.. This place give me an entire lime!!! My god.. The first place that ever did that  The only thing stopping me from giving this place 5 stars is that it took a while for our food to come out.. It didn't take an hour, but it was maybe about 15 - 20 which is slow for pho.. But you can't beat a full satisfying meal for under $10... And that includes tip.."}
{"text":"Arriving pretty late in Toronto and not wanting to eat McDonalds I now regret eating there and we only ate there because after 11 days traveling in foreign lands that seem to only cater for fast foods you kind of miss eating vegetables. When my partner and I first arrived we were greeted by a sea of over-worked staff who didn't even bother to say hi and just pointed to a corner table and threw menus, a pencil and a piece of paper that looked like it belonged to an accountant. Never in my life have I seen this as I guess it's your f@&k up to whatever you order blah blah. After deciding what my partner and I wanted we ticked the right boxes and then we waited for staff to take our piece of paper... 20 minutes later still waiting meanwhile there are 4 staff members on the floor working and not paying attention to their customers, as soon as one of them decided it was time for us to eat another disgruntled patron then yelled out that he has been waiting for his bill. Food was served 20 minutes later. They plonked down our pho on our dirty table which I forgot to mention earlier. Anyhow the food and the price and the service is basically what you pay for... cheap and shitty."}
{"text":"There's late and then there is Past Late (which comes right after Pretty Late). And it's only past Past Late that you show up to joints like Xe Lua.  I visited here for the first time after the Yelp Magic 8 Ball with a group of hardcore night owls all hungry for noodles. You'll miss it if you walk too briskly up Spadina; it's embedded on the west side of the street, south of Dundas on the second floor of a Chinese commercial complex. It's a large and inviting space, perfect for your uncle Ken's 68th birthday party.   From what I can recall the food was OK. I wasn't wowed by my noodles and pork, and the broth was lukewarm and not terribly exciting. Still, I'd come here again. Even if the servers seemed like they wanted to gouge our eyes out with metal chopsticks, the atmosphere was much nicer than your typical Chinatown digs, they have a lot of options, and did I mention they were open late? They're open really, really late.  Obligatory Title Pun: What the PHO?  Menu Readability: Chock full with photos.  Need to mention: They take credit. Oh, and no \"cold tea.\"  What this place teaches me about myself: Being open late might earn you a whole extra star."}
{"text":"First - congrats to the train place finally took down their Grand Opening sign after a good 3 or 4 years :')  This place honestly is great, but not for its food - for the good ambiance and large menu variety. Xe Lua is probably one of the best places to go after a long tiring day of school, or for dinner before a special school event at night. They're pretty good for parties of up to 10 as well.  Food wise is another story. The pho is cheap and tasty, but everytime I eat here, I feel kind of sick/bloated for an hour after. I've also tried their curries (which are NOT COMPARABLE when you have Malaysia and Thai Basil right next door), and their meat rice dishes (which lack a lot of flavour). Their slushes are pretty decent though."}
{"text":"I tried this location after visiting the Bayview location a few times. The food was consistent with what I had experienced in the past. I ordered #201 seafood and transparent noodle soup ($6). The noodles were tasty and the broth was flavorful. It was so delicious that my bowl was completely empty at the end, which doesn't usually happen.  On the other hand, the service could be improved. It took a long time to get our order taken (all they have to do is take our paper) and also took a long time to get our check."}
{"text":"Every so often, I'll get a craving for pho. Every so often, I'll pop into Xe Lua.  I feel pretty safe ordering from here. As in, I am relatively certain whatever I order will be good. Having had various combinations of noodles and soups, I can say that there hasn't been a time (that I can remember) where I've been left with a frown in my tummy.  Though they once did forget an order of fried tofu, but they were great about it. Surly service overall but I prefer the challenge of hunting the wait staff down.  For what it is, Xe Lua is a solid a-ok."}
{"text":"What to try?  Their pho!! I ordered the house special and I thought their soup base was a bit fatty and tasteless than the ones I had at other places. Nonetheless I like that this pho place is reliable to come here after a long night out partying or clubbing. Good for people who want food after drinking/clubbing!! Def a spot to spot rowdy crowds of people after 2 am.   Last tip?   The noodles you get here are slightly different than the noodles you get at a typical pho place. The noodles are fresh noodles and a bit fatter than the noodles you get at other pho places. Try it yourself and see!"}
{"text":"I think this is likely the best pho restaurant in Chinatown.    Funnily enough, I think EVERY pho place in Chinatown has at least one review in their window touting that they are one of the best pho restaurants in Chinatown, so it's hard to choose.  However, I have to say that Xe Lua has never done me wrong.  I always order the 101 Chef's Special Pho, broth is always piping hot, onions and beef are thinly sliced, and the noodles are always the Vietnamese version of al dente.  Staff are what you would usually find at a pho restaurant - brisk and somewhat brusque but they get the job done.  Not sure what you would expect otherwise for a $5 dinner!    Side note: don't ever go to 88.  Shudder."}
{"text":"Their most popular meal was extremely oil and had bits of cut up beef instead of full sized slices, it looked like we were given leftovers and I will never be going here again  The employees were extremely rude and 0/10 recommends"}
{"text":"Okay place for Vietnamese food. Good place for a quick bite, reliable good , okay quality not great, quick service"}
{"text":"Is there better pho?  for sure,.. but you wont find many places around east chinatown that has the variety that Xe Lua has.  I have been coming here since i was a very young teen... over 15 years ago.    This was the go to place back in high school, until 88 opened across the street, but now i think this place is better.. (only comparing these two within east chinatown) btw 88 is now \"pho house\"  which imo is not good..  They have many Vietnamese specialtys including my favorite.. the fermented raw pork with pepper corn...  i only see this offered in very authentic Vietnamese places..   i had it with vermicelli... not bad .. they also give you a choice of fresh noodles or dry noodles.. not every place gives you this option.  i would come here again..."}
{"text":"I love me a bowl of viet pho no matter where i am. Although tasty in its own way it didnt satisfy my craving for the msg beefy brothness i wanted. The soup here was lighter. Also tried the avocado drink here which was interesting and somewhat tasty/ refreshing."}
{"text":"excellent pho -- one of my favorite pho-places in the city. Great for late nights too."}
{"text":"We've become completely dependent on Yelp but without a data plan on our Toronto trip, we had to decide on restaurants the old fashioned way. It was past 11pm and we were hungry so we decided on Xe Lua because it looked bright and nice from below.  The bf ordered a large bowl of standard pho and it's nothing special compared to the pho we have at home in the SGV.  The broth and meat were good but the noodles were not cooked properly. I ordered Beef Satay with Egg Noodles and I also didn't love the noodles. The other problem was that the slices of beef in my bowl tasted completely flavorless."}
{"text":"This place is awful. The service is.. you can't even say there was service. Rice dishes came out first, then pho, and lastly, our drinks. It should be the other way around. The wait is long, and the patrons here are as rude as can be. People are pushy, and the servers do not know how to handle how busy it gets. The food was not good, and my mango smoothie was lukewarm when it got to me. I question the cleanliness of this place because they serve their food on the same cart as they bus tables. Disgusting. I find the only reason this place is still open is because it is open so late."}
