{"text":"The family just had dinner and we were impressed.  The portion sizes were good, but more importantly everything tasted great.  Our server was amazing-  had fresh drinks before ours were empty and food came out really quickly.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It's new, so some kinks to work out.  Beautiful venue though.  Drinks seemed watered down and a bit weak, but food and service were on point! I had the shroom with sweet potato fries. Burger was cooked perfect (mid rare) and fries were crispy.  My boyfriend has the Angus and fries, again perfect cook on the burger (medium) and killer fries. The server was great and food and drinks were fast coming out.  We'll be back soon to see how it's coming"}
{"text":"Stopped in the  first part of May. I was happy to have a new place to hang out at but that changed quickly . The menu is small -burgers, wings some sandwichs. Nothing to set it apart and the prices where kinda up there. The wait staff looked like something out of Rocky Horror.  Not impressed enough to go back."}
{"text":"Our 4th time here since they opened. Great atmosphere, drinks and food. Happy hour prices are amazing as well. Glad to have a place like this close to home! A must try!!!"}
{"text":"No thanks... was really hoping for something good to come to east Mesa but this was a let down. 2 stars for the cold beer and ambience has potential, but wait staff was slow and kind of grumpy, food was a little high priced, and quality eh. Not a fan of the wings."}
{"text":"They have added new items to their menu. The pulled pork sandwich and fish fry were both fantastic.  The employees were all very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing special, slow service. It took the appatizers about 20 minutes to come out. Boneless wings were bland. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Called in for take out, they said ten minutes. I get here and they tell me the food is going to be another 15-20 minutes. What takes 40 minutes to cook in an industrial kitchen? Not coming back here that's for sure."}
{"text":"Great sevice lots of tv's, food is excellent and the drinks are cold. Great atmosphere would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I was shocked to read that other reviews say the food and service is bad.  We have been to the Raging Bull for dinner with friends and it has always been so yummy.  Love the french dip and tater tots.  Fish fry was incredible.  Service always good.  Woody and Porsche are keepers for sure.  Drinks are priced affordably and bands are great!  The place is always packed! Try it - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The whole family really enjoyed all of the food here. Wings were awesome. Very important to us they are cooked correctly and crispy. These were perfection. Happy we are walking distance from this sports bar. Great quick service, and our server (blue hair) super friendly and very accommodating. 5 stars all around ."}
{"text":"Great food, very bad service. Asked for more napkins, never got any... took 30 minutes just to get change. It seemed like they were very understaffed even for Father's Day. Small things like that made my visit less than enjoyable. However the food was very good!! I think if they had a to-go option that would be perfect."}
{"text":"Great selection of burgers. The sweet potato fries are wonderful. It is nice you can get sweet potato fries with your burger for no additional cost. I used the Yelp coupon for $5 off 25 so that is always nice.  I was disappointed the do not have fresh mint to make mojitos."}
{"text":"Their live music is scary. Better off turning up the radio. Our sever sucks. Menu and drink selection is nothing special. I think my 9 year old can cook a more unique menu. It is more a back yard bbq menu. I had their French Dip. It was good, but not great.  The sweet potato fries were horrible. The prices on happy hour beer and food was a little over priced. I can not give them more then one star."}
{"text":"Went there a couple of weeks ago to try it out since I drive by it all the time and I've been waiting for it to open. Service was okay, seems like they are still working the bugs out. Ordered a beer in the bottle as they only had the typical \"crap\" in my opinion on draft.  Some one at the bar (not sure if it was the bartender or the server that brought me my drink) has no clue on bottle etiquette and poured my beer into a glass. I did not order a draft beer and when I order a bottled beer I do not like to drink it out of a glass. Pretty sure it was a rookie move but still. Food was good but we only shared the nachos because we just wanted to check the place out. Will go back again once they have some experience under their wings."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place because I always see a ton of people there. This was our first time walking out while waiting for drinks. We waited 15 mins to order drinks! Then we waited another 10 minutes before we decided to leave because we still hadn't got our drinks yet."}
{"text":"Delicious food and nice atmosphere, food took a bit long but other than that it was pretty good would recommend if you're looking for a relaxed average burger place"}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour. Great service, great happy hour specials. Loved the fries and tots!"}
{"text":"Where do I start.. The owners were also the same owners at Mad Dogs in mesa. I think I liked Mad Dogs better. The food was ok nothing special. I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was okay. I order tater tots with that and I got maybe 10 tater tots with my order.. Prices were a little high for the quantity and quality of the food. I don't think I would come back. It wasn't busy at all and its more of a family oriented place instead of a bar. HUGE let down knowing they were the owners of Mad Dogs and they made such big changes. Should have stuck with Mad Dogs and the location off Staple."}
{"text":"Excellent menu, very attentive customer service--Cassie is the best! Great selection of large screen HD TV's, great ambience. Glad to have this place in my neighborhood.   Top notch sports bar, super clean, comfortable booths, convenient tables. Not affiliated with the place in any way, I just love it"}
{"text":"Sports bar atmosphere with sports bar food. Lots of TV and gets pretty rowdy on football nights. Food is pretty good, our server wasn't very attentive."}
{"text":"Service was slow but polite.  Wasn't impressed wings small n cafeteria fries. No pitchers for beer. Bathroom smelled horrible. Like freaking sewage. The restaurant is big enough for pool tables or some entertainment. I think place is really nice inside and has potential. Televisions are nice. If they don't change some things its just gona close down like the others."}
{"text":"Well my updated review is saddening. I had high hopes for this place, but I will not be coming back. Service is awful now and they have removed their \"daily specials\" this used to be my favorite place to go on Mondays for BOGO burgers, but there is nothing to keep me coming back anymore. I no longer can recommend Raging Bull"}
{"text":"About 25 tv! I ordered potato skins - best I have ever had! When my escrow closes, I think I will take my son with me to the Raging Bull to celebrate! When my other son turned 21 and this building was another name -I bought a beer for both of us."}
{"text":"Mushroom burger was the bomb!! Great sweet potato fries are awesome. Mac n cheese awesome... hubby had the Rueben loved ot!!!"}
{"text":"Not good. The waiter was good but everything else was a nightmare.  The specials they advertise were not available. Appetizers were a joke! If this business is alive next year I will eat my shoe."}
{"text":"Great tv set up for football games and good priced food and drinks. We didn't do the BBQ but it smelled amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was a mediocre as you could get, and the price was a couple dollars more than better restaurants or sports bars. We had chili (blah) with stale crackers, Cobb Salad (also blah), and steak street tacos that had tough non-seasoned beef."}
{"text":"The service is superb with Sativa on our first time visit. She recommended the Prime Rib Dip & OMG the portion, the flavor!!!!! Try it! We dined outside & enjoyed the 80 degree Nov weather!  Hey, it's a great place to kick back! See ya there!"}
{"text":"Food was good, my burger needed seasoning . all beverages except the red wine were acceptable.  The wine was starting to turn.  Our server was new to the game but very pleasant.   Wish the manager would of made the rounds to say hello.   Hopefully it wasn't the gentleman sitting at the bar watching television.   All in all I will return."}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood sports bar.  Service was great, Shanda was friendly and efficient. The grilled cheese we had was tasty, nicely toasted and had crispy bacon.  The tater tots were crispy and not greasy at all.  The mac and cheese....well....I think they could do better.  Over all our experience was great... we will be back."}
{"text":"Need more of a menu selection. all there is is sandwiches. The service was kind of slow but the food turned out to be excellent. Mixed drinks were a little weak.  Service was a bit slow but there still new and just getting used to it."}
{"text":"Finally - it's nice to see something that has a chance of success in this location. Our first time here and we'll be back for sure. Good burger, excellent Reuben and holy cow their sweet potato fries are awesome. High quality hi def TV's - it doesn't look like there is a bad seat in the house. Friday night and the place was humming with a positive vibe. Thanks to Hannah for the great service."}
{"text":"The Bull started off rough, but have turned it into a really cool place with great staff and great service.  The happy hour is great although the prices of food is high and drinks are too if not on special"}
{"text":"Nice place. A lot of very big TVs to watch the \"big game\"  . Service was very nice. Beer was cold and the food was pretty darn good. Definitely go back. They have two guys playing piano's while we were there and taking requests. Very fun atmosphere and the live music was great. Pretty classy for a sports bar."}
{"text":"My wife and I invited another couple to join us for breakfast at Raging Bull as we had all wanted to try this fairly new restaurant. The service was not up to what you would consider 5 star as it was incredibly slow (our server was pleasant) in spite of few customers.   I requested fries instead of home fries to go with my breakfast order. The response... fries cannot be ordered before lunchtime. Really? Wow, unbelievable. Also, three of our party had coffee which was not good at all. My iced tea tasted stale even though our server stated she'd brewed it herself before opening for business.   Other than the slimy friut medley, the food our party ordered (omelet, eggs over easy, home fries, bacon, sausage & toast) was all right. The pancakes were actually very good and were the highlight of our breakfast experience.    Based on this visit, we will not  repeat a visit to this establishment for breakfast. Many other superior establishments for breakfast available here in Mesa and the rest of the valley. Totally disappointed with this breakfast experience. Maybe the service for lunch & dinner is better. I see others have had more positive experiences.   It bothers me to leave a negative review. Sadly, at least for breakfast, it's warranted."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. 4 super huge tv's to enjoy the games on. Ate \"The Hatch \" burger and it was delicious. But it took them 2 tries to cook it all the way. Wings tasted amazing but not a good quantity for the price. Not enough servers for as big as this place is. Took 30 mins for someone to even come and ask for our drinks. Our server was really nice once he finally got to us. But the other girl servers didn't seem very helpful or friendly. So over all food was great, service not so much... kinda pricey too."}
{"text":"This place is great for football on Sundays. The food is decent, good beer prices, tons of TVs. I usually order wings. They get the job done. Bartenders are always friendly and fun."}
{"text":"This may become my favorite sports bar! Every corner is has a tv and the owner is very accommodating with what sports you would like  to watch. The prices are a little high but very worth it for the quality. Had the Elk burger and it was perfectly done and delicious."}
{"text":"Sadly,  the food is good, but recently the experience has declined.  Tonight I had my second worst experience in my 62 years.  It tied with Trump Plaza in Atlantic City 1991, the only other time I ever stiffed a server.  The food at Trump Plaza was a \"comp\",  so I gave Donald a pass on his lowlife untrained servers.    At least Donald wasn't sitting around uselessly like the manager tonight was...  I won't be back."}
{"text":"We went to Raging Bull night before last, we were excited to try it! It was not too busy, we sat ourselves in a booth at the bar, waitress took our orders fast. We ordered habanero wings, french dip and club sandwich to share and try many things, we were not disappointed! Everything was good, tasteful, the restaurant was clean and very well designed. We hope it makes it, cant wait to go back again and try happy hour."}
{"text":"Love the Sonoran chop salad and fried cheese curd. Excellent service and clean. Friendly environment and good beer selection. Good happy hour all week."}
{"text":"This is a good sports bar. We were there on a Saturday night and sat at the bar. Bartenders were very attentive. We had hot pretzels and chicken fingers with fries. Both were above average bar food. We liked the atmosphere. Good place to watch sports as the many TVs are tuned to different sports. If you drink wine the wine choices are limited."}
{"text":"Like others, I was very excited for this place to open after driving by and reading the little info they had on their website, which they've since removed most of the previous text that was on there.. Finally got the chance today to try it and haven't been this disappointed since I found out Santa Clause wasn't real.   Walk in and TVs were on everywhere (20+ I would guess), good start, but that was pretty much the best our evening would be. We each ordered a beer and waited a good 10 minutes before we got it, but at least it was cold. The second time we ordered a round it took just as long.   We started with the \"no bull\" nachos with pulled chicken, or as I like to call it \"nacho soup\". The chips were homemade, I believe, but very thin and with amount of grease/water and toppings, everything turned into a big soupy mushy mess. Next we decided to try the wings since it's hard to mess up chicken wings and they had some decent sounding flavors; we went with the raspberry jalapeño and the Az gold BBQ. The raspberry jalapeño wasn't a sauce, more of a juice that had some honey added to it, but it didn't stick to the wings and just made a big puddle; there was no spice from the jalapeño. For the Az gold BBQ, they should have just called it honey mustard, if that's what you're looking for, they'd be decent. The skin on both was a little chewy and overall the wings and sauces were poor.   Services is very friendly and the space inside is nice, I hope they are able to turn things around, but unless there are major improvements, I doubt we'll be back"}
{"text":"I hope this place makes it. Really good food. Mac Daddy Burger was banging. They have some of the new restaurant service issues but staff is friendly and engaging. So far I've met the bartenders Aaron and Megan and both were very good. They don't have many IPAs to choose from but they do have O'Dell's so at least theres a solid go to for IPA lovers."}
{"text":"Was it just me or did any one else taste the last 3-4 restaurants that this place has been/used whatever my burger was cooked on ? I really enjoyed the Time Machine Elk burger I could really taste the \"vintage\" going back the so many years .  Guac is Extra Hep C is free."}
{"text":"We came here 3 weeks ago. I had a Reuben my husband had prime rib French dip it was excellent came today I ordered an Angus burger medium rare it was well done and dry I took it home for my dogs. Husband a Schroom burger it was ordered medium rare also came out well done. Will think twice about coming back."}
{"text":"I give that 5 stars, because of my bartender Porsche, who by the way, I loved her cute petite body in those short shorts! Lol. I had 2 rounds of, a cape cod with grey goose vodka & a corona. The cape cod was a tall glass too! Total $24 bucks for 4 total drinks. $7 x 2 for the cape cod, & $5 x 2 for corona, equal $24. Tip over 15% came to $4! Total bill $28 for 4 drinks equal $7 each drinks average. That's kind of high, but considering I have paid more the same drink at Cheese Cake Factory!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! They make nearly everything fresh. There are tons of TV's for the Sports fans. We stopped in because it was near the retirement community we were staying at with family. We were pleasantly surprised. Give this place a shot if you like quality food and a sports friendly venue."}
{"text":"I actually liked everything about this place currently but I docked 1 star for now because the interior is still being upgraded.  The service was quick and everyone was polite. The menu contains your usual variety for a sports bar.  The table side s'mores seemed interesting but we did not try it.  The draft beer selection is on the light side but that is a personal preference for me.  Our meals were cooked well and tasted delicious .  I will come back after renovations are complete and see how it turns out.  I think it is about time someone succeeds in this building."}
{"text":"Had the same experience as Jose G.  I was told the rude and obnoxious customers \"Spend a lot of money here\".  We will spend our money and time elsewhere, and not recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We come here for lunch with our 9 year old son and play pool with him and the food is amazing and so is the customer service!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and environment! Reasonably priced and our server, Richard was amazing! Can't say enough about how good the food is. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Megan was awesome! This was our first time coming here and we will definitely be back! Megan was quick, knowledgable, and very personable with us! The food was good and the beer was cold!"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times in the past and have had some good experiences, but recently the past few times have been poor service. We stood there waiting for 15 mins for a table, the only people waiting for a table and the host walked away. A server asked if we have been waited on and we let them know we needed a table and it took us about 5 mins for her to clean off a table so we could sit. Another recent time before that, we were standing there and they said we have no tables left so instead they scooted up chairs on the pool table. i mean we really didn't mind, but other people were there and not satisfied. Please improve the service here. I would love it other than that!"}
{"text":"Tons of games on big screens cold beer and decent food I had the Ruben large and tasty with onion rings also very good buddy had a burger that was very good according to him so over all great place lots of room hope they can get a steady clientele this place has seen many come and go ."}
{"text":"The first visit was great.  Food was good, service at the bar was great.  Went back for a second visit.  Quite the opposite.  Very disappointed.   Food not as good and drink prices were more expensive and not very balanced.  Service at the table was lacking.  Not sure if I will visit again"}
{"text":"Great food and great venue. They have free poker on Wednesday nights. They have a lot of tv's to watch all the games. They also have pool tables and dart boards."}
{"text":"If you skip this place your not missing anything. Short on service, and if you try to order something special ( hold the onions ) forget it they can't handle that request. Prices are normal food is ok nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Karen's attitude is HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She simply did not want to provide service. Why are you working here??????"}
{"text":"I have tried The Raging Bull 3 times now. The 1st time I got the Sonoran Chop salad. It was delicious! The vegetables were fresh, the chicken was cooked well, and the flavors were not overpowering. The 2nd time I got the Copper State Cob salad. It was just ok and definitely a let down after the Sonoran Chop! The vegetables were still fresh and the chicken was still well cooked, but it was bland and nothing special. 3rd time I got the Mac Daddy burger. The burger was a little overcooked, but it had good flavor. I added onion rings and they were really good. It has never been real busy when we have been there, but the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Walked into a seat yourself sign and did as I was told and sat I did. For 5 minutes waiting to see a server and another 5 to get menus. Asked for water with lemons and had waters show with no lemons. The server disappeared for another 5 minutes to get lemons. Ordered some hot wings, received a visit from someone working in the kitchen to confirm if we had ordered(weird), and finally those showed 45 mins later. You can do the math! We did quite a bit of sitting! If I wasn't enjoying the company of my grandmother, we would have left after the first no show. No bueno!"}
{"text":"Good food good atmosphere lots of TVs which I like for a sports bar, we did however order the freaking hot wings and they did disappoint us they were not freaking hot."}
{"text":"Breakfast-really a disaster!  Server, only one, was over-whelmed with tables!  She was good, but couldn't keep up with things like more water and coffee, etc.  From ordering food to arrival was 40 minutes for 2 of us.  From a view of what was going on it looked like the cook could only cook one table at a time before starting the next ticket.  Food was ok but nothing that said we'd return anytime soon.  The omelet was very brown, The chorizo was almost mon-existent, the toast came way after the entrees.  Hopefully they'll improve."}
{"text":"This place has been vacant forever, so it is nice to see it open again.  We weren't sure we wanted to try it, but we saw that Alex G reviewed it on Yelp. He always has good reviews, and if he says it's ok, we will go. He was right again.  They are still doing construction in part of the dinning room, but they have the bar and one side has tables. They had a guy playing the guitar who was pretty good.  Service was good. At first our server seemed like she wasn't that friendly, but turned out she was very nice.  We had the hatch chile burger and southwest chicken sandwich. Both were very good. Chicken was done just right, not dry at all. Burger had a lot of flavor. Menu is mostly burgers, but everything was good.  Worth a try. We will go back."}
{"text":"Like the old saying goes...\" First impressions are everything\". Unfortunately, the first impression they gave us was not great. Myself and 2 friends decided to try them for the first time...knowing that they are new, we were expecting a few hiccups, expecting them to still be working on the menu, etc. Between the three of us, we ordered 2 different burgers...one longhorn, one black and blue and a salad. All I can say about the burgers, is...you can go to almost any fast food restaurant and get a much better burger. The meat was totally bland. I honestly believe they did not season the burger patty at all. The buns were dry...not enough sauce...  Honestly...the worst burger I have ever had. My friend's wife got a salad($9) and there was a ton of mixed greens, an egg, avocado and some Bleu cheese sprinkled on it. Nothing else. The salad was just way too big and under dressed. For $9 it should maybe have some chicken on it? Also, the wait time for your food, as other people have said...is crazy!   Anyways, the staff tried, but overall, the experience was pretty bad. We may give them a few months and try again...see if they read these reviews...   We really wanted to like this place..but... we'll see if time will fix this.  Also, be careful sitting in the booths...if you're not careful, you'll get some mean splinters."}
{"text":"Walking in the door I was impressed. Menu does not have much to offer, food we had was ok, normal bar food. They have a long happy hour offering $1.50 domestic drafts. The bar was full of old people drinking the cheap beer and not eating. Wonder if they will be around as a business, big space high overhead and little customer spending. Hope they make it, but I doubt it. My wife tried to buy a tee shirt and they were out, the waitress told us she only had one shirt herself and works most days. Anyway not sure we will go back, lot of competition in the space and you need something to make you different and the Raging Bull is not different or special."}
{"text":"I'm happy that there's finally a good restaurant at this location! My family and I went in on Saturday night for dinner. We will definitely come back! The food was great and the menu had a good amount of choices. One of the managers said they were still doing more improvements."}
{"text":"Thank god something else moved into this building! My husband and I work at the hospital across the street, so after days like this where I haven't eaten all day and am hypogly-bitchy, the proximity of this place is a godsend.   I love the layout of the place and for 9pm on a weekday, service was really friendly and prompt. We had a beer and a cocktail called the Spinner. I'm a sucker for watermelon and chili, so perfect combo there. Next time I will try the flavored mules. Oprah got me hooked on those.   Food was pretty good, but some room for improvement. I loved the Mac Daddy burger. It was like a grown up Big Mac and perfectly cooked. My husband enjoyed his Hatch Chili burger as well, again a perfect medium pink. He also loved the steak fries as most places don't serve those anymore. I would have loved my potato wedges, but they weren't seasoned at all. Some salt would've been appreciated. I got a side of cheese sauce to go with them. It really had no flavor. Darn! Our potato skins had the same problem. Without adding some hot sauce, they were quite dried and bland. I am looking forward to trying the cheese curds next time and some wings.   We will definitely be back for another after work fix. I really hope this place is here to stay!"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! So buttery and delicious are the buns and a huge patti!! Also great customer service at the bar."}
{"text":"It is Tuesday so I'll give them a chance still. My burger was fantastic but they were cheap on the fries. Less than a handful, expected alot more. The boneless wings had amazing flavor, but again such a small portion for the price. The entree portions were just too small. The potatoe skins with pulled pork were loaded. That was a full meal in itself. Definitely would suggest that for an appetizer. Food had good flavor and they have only been open a month. The atmosphere is great for sports, alot of screens to keep you occupied. All in all its good, they need to work on the portions, I would come back."}
{"text":"Its currently their soft opening.  Their grand opening is June 1st. The place is huge with tons of televisions. But absolutely dead.  Our booth seats are just recovered.  We were all sinking in old worn out booths.  Like their are trying to save money in stupid ways.  We saw atleast 9 waitresses walking around but not one actually stopped at our table.  However, every single person stopped at the table across from us, several times.  We flagged down one to take our drink order.  She wanted to take our food order as well but we weren't ready. Big mistake!!! It took 20 minutes for us to find a waitress.  Its as if they all went to break at the same time.  The waitress  we finally ended up with was polite but clearly not skilled. The food is good but nothing to write home about.  Their prices are entirely too high.  We ordered medium hot sauce for the wings.  Umm way too much vinegar and too hot for a medium.  We also got nachos.  They were HUGE!! They need to have a half order.  The jalapenos were fresh not pickled. The cool thing was they layer the toppings.  I ordered the elk burger.  Its good but not worth $13 for the burger, pickle spear and crappy shoe string fries."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place and was hesitant based on reviews! I'm regretting not coming sooner. It's delicious. My 8yr old son tried the medium boneless wings. They were full of flavor and delicious. My husband tried The Bull Elk Burger and he says it was full of flavor and cooked to perfection, the bun was toasted just right. I ordered Nachos and OH MY HEAVENS they are so good. Light crispy  & topped with a white cheese sauce and shredded cheddar (melt in my mouth good ), the Guac is fresh and the salsa is roasted tomato! AND fresh jalapeños! Yes!!! It's rare these days. A great on tap selection and HH deals. I also had a spicy bloody... it was tasty too. Stop by!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Seated and served quickly. Tons of tv's everywhere.  Had a chance to meet the owner who was very friendly. Thoroughly enjoyed this place!"}
{"text":"We started out with chips, salsa and guacamole which were very tasty. We all had burgers which were juicy and so good! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worst wings ever no flavor so I asked for more suace the waitress was upset that I did not like them brings me ice cold suace needles to say did not eat them. Took over 45min for food  and then she noticed I did not eat wings and rips the bill or of my hand! Walks away  Lol...  removes wings. Wow  Okay. Never asked for that anyway  we are out and never again   Good luck raging bull"}
{"text":"This place is a great place to people watch and have a great time with friends.  The bartenders take very good care of their patrons   Definitely will go back to this place"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere!  Our server and staff were super friendly and helpful. Pricing for portion sizes is a bit off. Had two different sauces for wings, loved the Honey Habenero!! Nice and spicy!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, little pricey for what it was. We got the nachos and the honey habanero wings to share. The jalapeños on the nachos were much hotter than the habanero wings. The nachos were different from typical nachos with the black beans and roasted corn, but still decent. The wings were only so-so, not disappointing but they didn't make my mouth happy either. Service was pretty good. I would probably come here again."}
{"text":"Great sports bar! Our burgers were delicious. Loved our waitress Dj, she was sweet, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because the lunch menu didn't seem to have any lunch specials making it worth going back again. A little on the pricey side for lunch.  There are a lot of food places in the area  to choose from with better deals at lunch! The food was good....but not worth the price for a lunch."}
{"text":"Went on a weekday a couple weeks after it had opened up.  Not very busy even though it was happy hour.  I had beer, and the GF had wine, Ok selection.  My girlfriend got a hummus plate and reported that it was very good with lots of toppings, especially the basalmic reduction.    I am not into the trendy nightspots.  This may have that ambition and could make it if the location wasn't a killer.  Other fine places have failed here.  We shall see.  I would go back."}
{"text":"I always see this place on our way to my fiancé's moms house and finally tried it out for breakfast (recently opened in the mornings for breakfast) pretty simple breakfast menu, big portions and cheap.. the I took few stars off only bc it felt very disorganized and the restaurant was practically empty and it seemed to take forever with our food .. and the food just tasted okay nothing special about it"}
{"text":"Service was quite good and food was okay.  Limited menu and a little pricey ($14.00 French Dip) we tried a $12.00 Shrum burger 1/2 pound with fry's.  Good but we've had better for less."}
{"text":"DJay was a awesome waitress! Great food,  fast service,  friendly atmosphere! I will be back soon"}
{"text":"My husband and I come in a lot for the great happy hour draft beer. I had a burger today and it was awesome. Cooked to perfect medium, juicy and lots of fresh veggies for topping. The house fries (wedges) were enormous and very good. Glad RB is doing so well!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here on the evening of Friday 11/10/17 for what we thought would be a nice night out.  However, we were seated next to a group of loud obnoxious drunk bikers. One of whom was loudly boasting about how he liked to beat up minorities he kept referring to by using the N word. We were shocked and horrified and our night was ruined. We finished our food (which wasn't even that good) as fast as we could to get the hell out of there. We will never go to any establishment that condones this type of behavior."}
{"text":"Happy hour until 8 pm M - F night . Wow no where else has Happy Hour that late. $1.50 for a beer and $2.50 for Wells. Food was great. Live band also. Let's keep this place open. Please go an support your local place that has it all sports, music, good food, and great drink prices."}
{"text":"Cool place. I like it. Looking forward to when they get everything rolled out! Ice cold beer and great staff!"}
{"text":"The inside of the place is nice and the atmosphere is cool. It's a nice place for beers and sports. The bartenders were nice. I went twice and everything I ate sucked though. (Potato skins and wings)."}
{"text":"Burger was really good. The drink prices are great. They had some really great happy hour items and prices. It's right near Main St. so the crowd that comes in there can be a bit salty.  They were all nice. Maybe I would take my kids there or meet a client there for lunch. I wouldn't run the risk of taking someone during happy hour. A guy I sat next to at the bar seemed to be spending money that he doesn't have in order to buy his beer. Like counting out change to get his drink and no tip for the barkeep. I would go back but I would treat it more as a JJ Madison's type place. Not bashing either or, just s certain type of level of bar."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, the staff does quite well at, well I guess I didn't notice anything they didn't do a nice job on. Food and drinks seem reasonable in their price, but it's the flavor that will keep you going back for more, I know it's got me!"}
{"text":"Our server Richard is very cool. Great drinks and the atmosphere is wonderful. Looking forward to some great food."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. I had the Patty Melt with onion rings. Best patty melt ever. Huge, juicy, cooked just as I ordered. And the onion rings are outstanding too. Will go back  and try the Ruben.   Service was prompt and friendly   Came back again. While sone may complain about price they are forgetting this is not a Wendy's burger. But a fresh handmade burger. And the onion rings are the best. Now to cone back  and try other things on the menu. Hubby gut the elk burger. Said it was good and he ate the whole thing.  Again the staff is friendly and service was excellent. Thank you for a good sports bar."}
{"text":"Go elsewhere, the service sucks. While we waited over 15 minutes with no service i decided to use the ladies bathroom. The  bathroom was filthy, no toilet paper, paper towels and toilet paper all over the floor, and the bathroom was just filthy.  I went back to our table and my husband said still no service, so we walked out. The reason we had no service and the bathrooms are filthy is because the employees are too busy smoking outside. Very unprofessional and the owner needs to clean up the place and hire employees who want to work."}
{"text":"I finally returned to check out their burgers. I got a coupon in the mail for 1/2 off a second burger. My wife and I stopped in for burgers on a Monday for lunch. The place was practically empty. I noticed they opened up a dance floor and do karaoke on Monday nights.  After browsing the burger menu, I settled on the shroom burger. This is a burger grilled to order with sautéed onions, mushrooms, and Swiss cheese on a bun with lettuce and tomato. The burger was good. Nothing bad, nothing great, just an average mushroom and Swiss burger. It came with French fries which were more like home fries.   I rated this experience a 3 because if I'm spending $11-$12 for a burger it has to knock my socks off. This one didn't. I will take my burger cravings elsewhere."}
{"text":"We enjoy the chili for lunch. We added the nachos to share this time and was very pleased. Service is so so but it is a bar and grill. Looks like it can be a tougher crowd at night but lunch time has been fun for a date or a quick meal. Try the chili you won't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was out in Mesa and stopped by to check out the place in the hood...First of all the place was super clean ,service was off the hook, and the food was finger licking good ...I had the Pulled Pork and some Hot Wings ...They had Karaoke but on weekends they have Live Music Bands...This place is a diamond in the ruff ...Tell all your friends stop by support your local business...Cheer's Bluesman Mike"}
{"text":"Yum! Try the Elk burger! There guacamole is also ahhhmaaaaaizing! I don't eat chips so they brought it to me with sliced cucumbers. Very accommodating. Great service. Super clean, even the restrooms. Cool dishes, good atmosphere 5 stars absolutely!"}
{"text":"I have to update my review...   I recently went back for 2 visits back to back and enjoyed them both! They got their new menu running, which still isn't a ton but it has a little bit of everything. When I went back I took  my mom and she got the green Chile burger, I got the mac daddy.... I have to say I am super glad I went back to try them again. The food was perfect. Aside from the food exceeding my expectations, the waitresses were all super friendly quick and personable.   I still want to know what they have to offer at night such as band, karaoke, trivia??? Other then that i'm sold that the food and the service will keep this place afloat. They have really stepped up their game and made this place a \"go to\" bar and grill for food and drinks in the area."}
