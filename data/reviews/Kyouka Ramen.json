So well done. 
Only four star because they didn't have gluten free, that may have changed but otherwise it a 5 star review for sure!"}

{"text":"Great!! Food came very fast and the waitress was very nice."}
{"text":"I came here tonight, I was doubtful because of the previous claims of how the soup is too salty. However it was honestly delicious and so flavorful. I ordered the shoyu ramen and chicken wings. The chicken was nuts. Honestly and must get when you come."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my Kyouka ramen. Egg was perfect, broth was perfectly salty and fatty noodles still had a bit of bite to them which was lovely. The man had the Shio, which he loved and I look forward to trying. We also split the beef tendon on rice side which, as a big fan of tendon, I was really impressed with. Even the man who is not a tendon lover really liked how tender it was and not chewy, and great spice. Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"Can not even believe how amazing this place is. We had a ramen that was a special - miso ramen. So good! Someone mentioned fatty broth, but I liked it because it was really rich and so full of flavour. My daughter had the chicken wings which were amazing and the beef tendon (kind of surprised her b/c she wasn't expecting tendon but she ate it like a champ). The service was excellent also. We will be back without question."}
{"text":"Service: good
Food: had better
Location: good
Cleanliness: could be better
Decor: average

The soup had lots of MSG in it.  I has not feeling well for the rest of the day.  The only reason I would go back is because of the service (very attentive) and location (right on woodbine and down the street from work)."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this hidden gem in my neighbourhood and I must say, one of the best ramen I have had. For $15 I doubled up the ingredients and the ramen tasted so good. They use a vegetable broth which makes it less overpowering. We got the Shio Ramen, which had more of a fish taste and we also got the Kyouka Ramen which has more meat and is very hearty.

Service was great, and excellent vibe. Not much room for seats but didn't have to wait at all - I went in December. 

Great addition / surprise for anybody living or stopping by the Beaches area."}
{"text":"I love this ramen place. This is my new go to place for ramen. The noodles aren't your typical ramen noodles you get at every other ramen place they're a little chewier instead of being super soft. The soup is amazing. My favourite is the Kyouka special. I think the soup and noodles beat sansotei with a huge lead. They're tucked into a corner so maybe the location makes it less popular than sansotei but it also means there's no crazy line. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ramen is very good but I prefer a tad chewer but the broth is amazingly good and very different. Yummy in my tummy as I kid would say."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews on Yelp, felt I had to drop by to try this place out.  

Arrived shortly after noon on Sunday and the place was full already so people must have been waiting to get it even before they opened.  Usually a good sign.

My eating partner and I was seated at the counter after a 15min wait which seemed quite reasonable.  We both decided to order the signature Kyouka Ramen and Karaage since they looked so good in the pictures!  

Noodles came out very quickly and we were able to see the chefs behind the counter so that was cool.  I really liked the noodles, nice bite and definitely not soggy.  I liked the smoked meat as well although my partner thought the meat was not tender enough.  I didn't mind it but I can see why someone might think that way as the meat is quite lean but I prefer the lean meat over pork belly which to me is fatty but tender.  Which brings me to the soup.  The Kyouka Ramen broth is a mix of pork and chicken and I thought the soup was too fatty as I can see the fat floating in the soup (not garlic).  Not my thing.  The karaage was nice and for $6, you get 3 chicken wings which a lot of people seem to be ordering so looks like a lot of people approve.  

If you Check In with Yelp, you get a 10% discount which was nice.  I would say 4 stars bumped down to a 3 for the fatty broth.  I'll try the chicken broth based ramen instead next time.  Nice addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"It's 3.5. 

Overall an above average ramen place.

We had:

-Karaage Chicken wings ($6):Three pipping hot pieces of whole fried chicken wings in ginger, garlic, chashu sauce, mirin and white sesame seeds.  This one is quite tasty and good value. Rating: 4/5

-Shoyu Ramen ($11):  This one was okay.  The broth was a bit salty.  Above average thicker noodles.  Pork and chicken chashu were average.  Egg was average.  Rating: 3/5

-Dipping Ramen cold noodles + warm dipping soup/Less fat/mild ($11):  This one was quite nice.  Although the broth was even saltier it went very well with the cold noodles.  Rating: 4/5"}
{"text":"I am a relative newcomer to ramen, but felt that I was a purist. So before rushing off this review of our dinner at Kyouka last night, I googled, and I've changed my opinion slightly, for the better.

Backing up:
I live in Leslieville, and Shlo and I wanted ramen. He Yelped and found Kyouka, a relatively new place in the Beach, and we were off.

Entering the nicely renovated space (I have lost count of how many restaurants have tried to start up in this space and died a sad death over the years), the overpowering aroma was of fried chicken (aka karaage). But not the rich aroma I'm used to (and was craving) from the broth offered at my usual places, Touhenboku or Santouka. 

We both ordered Shio ramen, my go to. What arrived was interesting, but a bit strange as well. Green onions are chopped fine, which I didn't enjoy. Nori was present, half a nicely cooked egg, and a slice of kamaboko, all delicious. The chashu (one slice each of very pleasantly wood-smoked pork, one of chicken) was very nice. Maybe a little stingy. The noodles were firm and nicely chewy. But the broth...it was redolent of clam. The menu, which I'm referring to now (as I didn't have access to it after we ordered) says it's chicken and clam broth, but there was no hint of chicken. However, I missed the rich, mellow flavor that I strongly associate with true ramen, whether the broth is pork or chicken based (or a blend).

That being said, the googling that I referred to above says that places in Japan are offering clam broth in their ramen, so it's a *thing*. But it's not my thing. The broth was pleasant, but in my opinion (and possibly coloured by my expectation of pork) much too fishy. That being said, it was tasty enough that I finished nearly the whole bowl. But I wanted pork broth. Shlo, who had never had ramen before last night, enjoyed it very much, as he had no preconceptions about what to expect.

I now see that their house ramen has chicken and pork broth, and so I should have read the menu more clearly. Bad me.

The service was super quick, very polite, and altogether nice. Perhaps, as they offer such an unusual broth, they might want to explain the different options to sloppy menu readers like me on their first visit. Or make it stand out on their menu a little more.

So would I go back? Perhaps. But I'm more likely to drive a little further to Santouka when I have a craving, because I know it's stellar ramen. 

/git"}
{"text":"Soup is oily AF not going to lie and the port taste like cheap low quality chinese BBQ pork that's dry. To be honest avoid this place. Unless you want to have a bad time enjoying your meal. Also the spicy rice thing was so salty I'm pretty sure it was just all MSG. And to finally top it off I found cleaning brush plastic in my noodle. This place avoid at all cost."}
{"text":"I came here on the recommendation of my friend that had raved about this place, While my expectations were higher for this place because of my friend it is not due to my expectations that I was disappointed with the food, since I know what I like when it comes to my ramen. I got the Kyouka Ramen which seemed like a good choice considering it was named after the restaurant. I chose the light fat flavour with the mild chili paste. They have instructions on the menus recommend eating the ramen within 10 minutes of it being served.

From first impressions the ramen had blobs of oil on the surface. It was topped with a chili paste that you can mix in for a bit of a kick. I tried the broth with and without the paste, the chili paste gave it a stronger flavor to the mild broth. I can't recall what the ramen was topped with but I remember there being chives that I found a bit odd in my ramen. The restaurant claims to serve authentic ramen and not use MSG, however I never seen ramen being paired with chives and found the broth to be too mild for my taste. The texture of the ramen was what I didn't like about the ramen most of all, the noodle were too soft to the point of being like fresh made pasta, there wasn't much bite to it.

Personally, I have had better ramen and I feel like even Kinton was better than this place and it is my least favourite ramen place in the city."}
{"text":"I was happy to see a ramen place open up in the Beaches. I was even more happy with the food. This is traditional ramen at its best...with a twist on the kyouka ramen. I've tried the shoyu & kyouka ramen and the veggie shio ramen. All very, very good. Noodles were the perfect consistency and the broths were all perfectly complex & so so yummy. 
The prompt & friendly staff are great. Never had to ask for water fill up or had to wait & wave to get their attention, the attentive staff are helpful and very well trained. I've eaten ramen in Japan and this feels like entering a ramen shop in Tokyo...and tastes authentic too. I highly recommend this resto...just make sure to get there early for the lunch opening to get a table as they shutter for part of the afternoon & re-open again for dinner. Mmmmm noodles."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant on one of our trips to Costco and decided give it a try.  This is a really small restaurant so seating is limited.  We went on a Sunday afternoon, so had no problem getting seated.

The ramen runs for $11 or $13 mainly plus extra for double toppings.  The broth is flavourful, however, we found it a bit on the salty side.  The toppings were sparse.  The meat slices were thin, almost as thin as your packaged sliced processed meat.  The quantity was also limited.  I had no problem finishing my ramen by myself, where I usually would need my husband to help me.

Service was good."}
{"text":"My partner and I both got the Kyouka Ramen and absolutely loved it. He had it spicy and mine was medium spicy, spice level was perfect for both of us. The broth was rich and thick and more flavourful than many other ramen places we've tried in the downtown core. The chashu was melt-in-your-mouth, and noodles perfectly cooked. The only thing I would change about my order next time would be to ask for less fat bits..otherwise a perfect bowl of yumminess!

We also had the fried wings. Just as good as the other reviews had described. The flavours of this place seem to have a bit of a Chinese influence, but not so much so that it loses its Japanese profile. So happy to have tried it out!"}
{"text":"I get Ramen cravings from time to time... not for the kind from the pack, not even if I dress it up with egg and veggies -- but real Ramen with fresh noodles, fish broth, sliced chasiu pork,  and maybe a bit of that pink swirl fish cake and seaweed flakes. I was having one of those cravings one day when I went online searching for a proper Ramen place...

If you live in the beach, you know how lack of variety the food scene is here so I was pretty happy to find Kyouka. It's very convenient to the Fox theatre and they're the kind of place you find in Tokyo -- a tiny little  storefront that serves up a tightly edited menu of authentic Ramen. The servers don't speak much English, but are so nice about everything. You can sit at the bar and watch the chefs cook up the noodles and prep the dish, or at a table where you can focus on your companion.

I've had a few different kinds -- the Shio one time and the Shoyu the other time and also have had the chicken wing and the dipping ramen. All were really good, authentic, and really hits the spot when I get my ramen craving. The food would be 5 star, but I took one star off because the seating is really tight and the surfaces seem to promote noise. Twice there was a crying baby in the restaurant and that last one screamed for 15 straight minutes and everyone in the restaurant can hear him! I also find their ramen really rich and have to lay down after I eat a bowl of them :)
The added chopped fat is authentic but if you don't want it, ask to leave it out..."}
{"text":"Great place for ramen! Friendly services. beef tender don is amazing. It's a great way to finish with a ramen.  They only open for lunch and dinner - so go early if you don't want to wait for long. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came to Kyouka Ramen on Family Day, and surprised they were open! My friend raved about the food here so we decided to go together.

Ordered the : chicken wings (6$), Shoyu chicken broth ramen $11, and the beef tendon donburi $6.

The chicken wings were seasoned well and hot from the fryer, however I disliked the fact they came full-wing style and not cut up. It was odd to eat with your hands and then switch back to chopsticks for the ramen. I would prefer karrage (boneless fried chicken) like the other ramen joints. The beef tendon donburi was disappointing. The tendon texture and the starchiness of the rice made it a very carb-rich dish and it just wasn't very tasty over all.

The ramen was decent. The broth was tasty, however my noodles were a tad over-cooked. They came out of a package and were tossed into the ramen boiler. I prefer my ramen al dente rather than soft and mushy. 

At just over $40 for 2 people, I will likely not return to Kyouka Ramen."}
{"text":"This is another one of those undiscovered places in Markham with ramen that's different from the rest. 

They have a really interesting ramen where there's a lot of chicken fat floating on top of the soup. I asked the waitress and she said this was for more flavour? Sort of like duck fat?! Anyway, if you don't like this, don't order the original.

The highly hyper chicken wings weren't as good as some of the reviews. Chicken wings were a bit bland on the inside and wasnt very seasoned in the batter either. 

I found their meat to be the highlight, it's different from all the other places. They give you one piece of pork and one chicken. Both have a smokey flavour to it which I enjoyed. 

Service was good here, friendly staff. And best part, no line. :)"}
{"text":"I love this place and I am not sure why this guy opened in the Beach of all places, but I am so glad he did! The portion size is perfect, the broth is rich and fatty and delicious, the noodles are chewy on their small but perfect little menu. We also always get the donburi tendon on rice and the wings. The place is pretty tiny and it gets busy right at dinner time so we try to time it so that we come a bit later on when it's slowed down a tiny bit.
Best restaurant in the Beach."}
{"text":"I visited with my friend for a hearty bowl of ramen. I was initially scared because I had a bad experience at the Markham location. This place was different. The servers were friendly, the food came on time, and the flavour was great.
I ordered the anchovy ramen. It had a good seafood flavour on top of their soy sauce ramen. I really liked it and finished so quickly. I would have ordered extra noodles.
This location is far from where I live. I would love to come back if I am nearby."}
{"text":"First visit was pretty disappointed overall. The broth was very oily, and the pork was too thin and dry. The service was pretty bad. Their machine allowed AE and the transaction has been approved, but the waitress forced us to reverse transaction and used another credit card. If they do not accept AE, they should have disabled the function or let us know in advanced. It didn't provide authentic Japanese dining experience that I usually had from other Japanese restaurants. 

I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"The storefront is clean and bright with about 8 bar seats and 4-5 small tables.

Main: 
Kyouka Ramen - less fat + spicy
You can choose the amount of floating pork fat pieces based on how rich you want the noodles. The ramen broth is rich and not overly salty even with the spice paste mixed in. The spicy option is not too spicy. I like the good amount of bean sprouts and chives which gave the ramen more dimensions.

Karaage Chicken Wings - takes 10-15 min from order
3 full wings with the order. Served piping hot. Wings were crispy and flavoured inside out. There is a good amount of sauce and not too salty. Seems like the chef did some work to separate the drumsticks from the wing, which was a thoughtful touch.

Service is efficient and servers are very attentive. They can navigate their way through the little narrow shop with ease!

I find the downtown location tastes better than the uptown location."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes after slurping some good ramen you feel really heavy, bloated or even mildly greasy because of all the salt and/or msg after taste? Well, if you're looking for ramen with broth that taste light but still flavourful, this is the place for you. What more can you ask for? Delicious ramen that leaves you with a good food baby and not a bad one."}
{"text":"Kyouka Ramen is its own standalone plaza and parking lot.  The location used to be a burger joint and so the exterior and layout retains most of the previous decor.  It seems like a new business because the staff are young and inexperienced which isn't a big deal but could be improved.

The menu is very limited, with about 4-5 choices of ramen and side dishes.  It's a pleasant surprise to be able to choose your 'fat level' in the soup, perfect for those who are health conscious and my parents who prefer a lighter soup.  I've tried my regular soup and a lighter soup and have to say the lighter soup tastes a bit bland.  

There's also an option to 'load' your ramen with more toppings which is great because I always feel like I don't have enough meat or toppings in my ramen.  

All in all, my experience at Kyouka was okay, but its limited menu options and it's slightly out-of-the-way location does not encourage me to visit again right away."}
{"text":"Heard that this is a restaurant fond of Japanese noodles,  ramen. Note: I visited the shop in downtown, not the one in uptown, Markham. Heard the quality is different. When I stepped into the restaurant, it is like any authentic Japanese restaurant, it is small in size, and the waitresses were Japanese (well! I could understand what they are talking). But I was surprised to see one of the chefs is an east Asian. I don't mean to be prejudice but I did start to doubt if my ramen would be prepared in an authentic way. 
So I ordered a bowl of Kyouka Ramen and my husband ordered a dipping ramen.

Kyouka Ramen: (score: 4/5)
One thing I like this ramen the most was the soup was hot. It gave me a sense that the noodle was freshly made and was not prepared in advance. In addition, I was sitting at the bar where I could see the chef cooking. Besides the soup, the noodle was chewy though a bit thick to my preference. The noodle came with a slice of chicken meat and a slice of pork with half an egg. I had to mention that the egg was soft, the egg white was as soft as tofu. I really wonder how could they do that. Moreover, this ramen went well with a glass of cold beer.

Dipping Noodle: 
I tried a few bites of it. Under the comparison of my order, the sauce of the dipping ramen was not as hot and was a bit salty to my taste. My husband requested to exchange or to warm up the sauce. The main chef refused and explained the reason why he could not exchange the sauce with the waitress. I guess it's the language barrier, the waitress did not explain anything after the long talk by the chef. She just said they could not exchange the sauce. I believed the chef saw the situation that the waitress just left without an explanation, he came to us with his limited English and explained the culture of how to eat dipping noodle. I really appreciated how the main chef treated the customers preciously, he would put down his order and ensure his customers felt they were being taking care of. Because of this main chef and his great service, I wanted to give this restaurant a 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great service, delicious taste, good portion and affordable price. 

They take credit/debit and cash but no Amex.  

Yelp Check In offer: 1 free ice cream per yelp check in (black sesame or green tea)

A small little place across from Le Baron on Woodbine south of Hwy 7.

They offer take out where they have separate containers for the noodles and the soup.

Pricing start at around  $11 for Ramen. They have $5 beef tendon donburi which is very soft and satisfying.

They have a page for sake and beer ($6 sapporo and $4.50 sleeman) but they do not have it yet.

They charge for tea and pop. Water is complimentary though.

It's a little squishy when seated because of how close the seats are to each other. Their noodles are at perfect texture but a bit different from the usual places such as Kinton and Sensotei. 

They have a broth that's anchovies based. A bit fishy but interesting.  

When leaving they bid their farewells in Japanese. Nice little place to try."}
{"text":"Good and fast lunch service- many Ramen options and you can even pick the level of broth fattiness ! The noodles were a good consistency and the broth was tasty. I will be back."}
{"text":"The kyouka ramen was good , but a bit too salty for my liking . Also the extra spicy sauce was not that spicy . But I can handle a lot of spice . To me it just tasted like salty broth with no heat ."}
{"text":"This was great! I passed by it and thought I'd give it a try. Service was great. There was spots in the wall next to the bar area where you can easily charge your phone if you need to. I didn't need to. I ordered their popular Kyouka Ramen....YUM! Soup base was delicious, all the items in the soup were amazing. The noodle was great! I would totally go back for another round of ramen..."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Dogstars. This place is perfect. The employees are so sweet I want to cry about it right now. Like, deliriously sweet. 
The ramen was just beyond. I guess I've never had ramen before this. Not like this. Heavenly. Prices are good. Portions are perfect, I had one bowl and think I might explode. I had the Kyouka ramen, medium spicy, my toddler son had the dipping ramen, and we shared the spicy chicken dish (I forget the name). Dipping ramen is just genius, I'll be getting that next time. My son loved the fish cakes and the meat pieces the best, silly boy. Though he put away his fair share of noodles as well - and slurped like a pro. He was a bit rambunctious and messy, but these wonderful employees were so graceful about it. I gave them a 20% tip because they deserved it. 
Lastly, the green tea was perfect, not too bitter, light and tasty. I can't wait to go back when we're not driving so I can try the plum wine. 
Thank you, Arigato, Kyouka! Delightful! 

(Love the little info cards at every setting, very interesting to read. Seriously about to shed a tear over how much I love this place. )"}
{"text":"Best ramen along with other dishes. We can't wait to come back and try more - so glad we stumbled onto this place after seeing a movie at The Fox Theatre. The place is small, brightly lit with staff happy to welcome you despite arriving half an hour before closing time as we did. Great prices, a nice small selection of dishes to choose from - quality not quantity. We got ramen, a rice dish and Karaage chicken. Highly recommend you try this place, it's one of those hidden gems."}
{"text":"Great little spot in the Beaches and the perfect fix for East Ender Ramen cravings. 

Simple options and delivers on the Ramen (and beer). Staff are friendly and service is quick!"}
{"text":"Location/Service
It is right on Woodbine, south of Highway 7. The restaurant is in its own plaza, but it's right across from Costco so not difficult to miss. 

Staff were very nice and friendly. They were also quick with the orders. There are seats by the ramen bar and tables of 4, so it's nice to come for a quick bite with friends. 

Food
There are a few ramen choices to choose from, along with a few appetizers available. Selection wise it's similar to other ramen places. 

I tried their Shoyu Ramen, which is made with a chicken broth and chicken chasu. I played the safe route for this ramen and it was relatively okay. The broth had a nice taste to it, but I found the chicken chasu over cooked and dry. The noodles were on a thicker end, but chewy and nice to taste. 

Overall it's nice for a first try. They have another one where you can choose fat level of the soup, this would make me come back again."}
{"text":"The best ramen I've ever tried. Staffs are friendly and kind as well as the ramen quality is incredible compare to other ramen shop in downtown. It's totally worth to come!"}
{"text":"Good ramen but seems just a little bit overpriced. Nice decor, very good service. It's definitely a refreshing change for this neighbourhood - first ramen place in the Beach."}
{"text":"Highlight: broth of the soupless vegetarian Ramen $13. Surprisingly delicious blend of sweet, salty, and savory. Good ratio of noodles and vegetables (cabbage and bean sprouts), and perfectly cooked soft boiled egg. 

Companion enjoyed the classic kyouka ramen $11. Contemplated getting double the toppings $15 but was happy with the original. 

Staff are very friendly and even though it was busy, they were quite attentive. Restaurant is clean and efficient. 

Tip: get there early, or be prepared to wait - worth it. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Not as good as their original location on Queen Street East. More available seating in this location but the service is not nearly as friendly. I ordered the vegetarian soupless ramen and it just wasn't as delicious as the ramen I fell in love with at their original location."}
{"text":"I would like to say they are now my No.1 Japanese ramen restaurant in Toronto!! (and I am Japanese!) Their ramen is very authentic and broth is amazing. (I can drink it no problem even though I usually find most of ramen broths are too rich/oily.)  One of my students who loves ramen told me that he did not like their ramen at Markham location. Apparently their ramen is different from the one at their beach location. Just be aware they are closed on Tuesdays...I with they open everyday or close on Mondays instead of Tuesdays."}
{"text":"First time here and the ramen was delicious! Noodles were not the typical kind of ramen noodles but the broth was to die for. I've tried many ramen noodles around the world including Japan and their ramen was definitely a must try"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst customer service since we stepped through the door. 

1) My friend and I were seated, however, the waiter spills broth all over myself and the customer next to me with no apology.

2) We ordered, waited 25 minutes for the waiter to tell us to wait another 15 minutes because they didn't process our orders. If we didn't ask the whereabouts of our ramen, they wouldn't have mentioned anything. 

Left with an empty stomach and will not return."}
{"text":"Small portion for a $11 bowl of ramen, broth was so oily that it started to congeal into white clumps as soon as the broth stopped being steaming hot.  Decor looked nice, but air was very stuffy with the steam, so it was quite uncomfortable.  Toilets were very cramped, and didn't even flush.  Nice effort but bad value."}
{"text":"This is my favourite ramen place and I have been to most known ramen places in TO. I get the tasty and filling Kyouka ramen. The service is super fast and friendly with lots of local traffic."}
{"text":"I thought after seeing all the positive reviews we'd give this a shot. I ordered the chicken wings and the Kyouka Ramen! Honestly I felt the chicken wings were under cooked and very greasy. Should have sent them back. I thoroughly enjoyed the Ramen, I felt there was also something in the Ramen that made it oily but it had great flavour. Great friendly staff."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after seeing it in Hot & New. Wasn't expecting too much after reading other Yelper's reviews. Ordered the Shoyu Ramen (no double toppings cause apparently it's not worth). It was alright at best. After going to Sansotei and Koi Sakana I must say that Kyouka is mediocre compared to the two. 

Onto the positive. Didn't have to wait and food was served pretty quickly. Pretty nice interior being able to see the chefs and all. Noodles were decent.

Onto the bad :(. The broth was REALLY oily. Normally I like to drink some of the broth but not this one. Quite unappetizing honestly. The toppings were okay in taste but definitely was not okay in terms of quantity. A little bit of vegetables and 2 very thin slices of pork.

Overall. It's a meh. At least it's a new place I guess."}
{"text":"I must confess, I am not a huge ramen fan, so my reviews are probably biased. Unless it's exceptional, 4 or 5 star ratings are a rarity. I have visited this location a few times and overall the experiences have been good. They have a promotion going on now where you receive 10% off by checking in on Yelp!

Service is fast, efficient and friendly, like most ramen joints. There is plenty of parking, as this is a standalone shop on Woodbine, south of Highway 7. And for the few times I've been here, it wasn't too busy.

Kyouka Ramen ($11) - The mixed chicken and pork broth was flavourful, but fatty and filling. Since I ordered the mild version, the small dollop of chilli paste added a little kick, although I didn't think it was necessary. The marinated soft boiled egg was done well, with a custard-like yolk. I enjoyed the hint of sweetness that was balanced out by the sake. The addition of green chives worked nicely as it lightened the otherwise heavy dish. The meat portions were small, though I enjoyed the slight smokey flavour. Overall, the noodles were decent, nothing to rave about. 

Anchovy Shoyu Ramen ($13) - I am a bit mixed about this bowl. The anchovies added a ton of flavour to the broth, however, with the additional seasoning, the soup got progressively salty, almost to a point where I started not to enjoy it. 

Overall, I wouldn't rush to come back, but it's not a bad spot for ramen uptown."}
{"text":"I'm always down for another ramen spot in the area, and this one definitely did not disappoint. Came by with my mom for lunch one day, and the place was hopping. It has a relatively smaller space, with only 7-8 tables and a few bar seats. The tables were placed close together though, so it was tough to even get through between them.

The food was quite good, as the menu provided very few options, which is a good sign in my opinion. I got the Shoyu Ramen, and chose to have it 'fully loaded'. Most places with give you the option to double up on noodles, but here they double up on your toppings. The chicken cha su on there was just similar to chicken breasts, so maybe ask to substitute for the pork if its doable.

Service was good overall, quick service and friendly staff. I would make a note not to get tea though, as they charge $1.50 for it. Just get some water! Make sure you check-in on yelp for some ice cream too!

Definitely going to come back, as they have an interesting 'Dipping Ramen' and going to try their Karaage Chicken Wing next time as well!"}
{"text":"I've had ramen at a number of restos in Toronto and Kyouka was a surprising stop.  The ramen options are a bit more limited, but in a good way.  I've tried both the shio and shoyu ramen.  Both are not overpoweringly oily and salty.  The pork shoulder they use is not as tender and flavourful as others, but the softboiled egg and generous portions make up for it.

Do yourself a favour and try the slow cooked beef tendon on rice.  This is a meal in itself and a steal at the price.  It's sticky and very tasty.  A warning though, if you don't like \"gooey\" food, go for the deep friend chicken wings instead.

I live in the beaches and my only gripe is there have been two occasions now where I've tried to eat here and it was closed.  Be sure to check the hours before you stop by! (they close in between lunch and dinner).  Service is very friendly.  It's a perfect place to grab a quick bite.  I give this place 5 stars as it will definitely be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"3.5/5 to be exact.

I had lunch here a few days ago.  The place is usually full but the wait is not that long.  The service was pretty fast.

So, for our group of 4, we had 2 orders of wings, 4 large ramen noodles and 2 iced teas. We had karaage wings for appetizers. There are 3 wings in each order. They are very good but quite oily. Next, we had the large shio ramen. Serving size here is pretty small so I ordered a large which is about the size of a small order of pho in most pho places (I know, it's different). Even with large, I was satisfied but not completely full. Anyway, the ramen is good and fresh. The broth is good but a bit salty.  The bill came out to just over $100 for lunch before tip. So, it's not that cheap for lunch. In the end, I prefer Santouka Ramen on Dundas St. E."}
{"text":"I heard decent things about this little ramen shop and decided that I wanted to finally try it for dinner. The restaurant itself is small but still looked clean and modern. We looked at the menu and the specials and we found they have a small selection of ramens. We ordered two bowls of ramen; one was the advertised chicken karaage ramen and the other was the kyouka ramen. I ordered the kyouka ramen fully loaded which gives you double the toppings. They messed up my order and only gave me one portion of the topping. It wasn't a big deal to me I just thought that it was sad how they're not even busy but still managed to mess up my order. The fat level of the kyouka ramen was original and even then the fat content of it was unbearable though it made it tastier. The karaage chicken ramen was really disappointing. They literally gave us 3 small pieces of the karaage and the bowl of ramen was $13. The portions are small and not worth the price. The only redeeming quality this tiny ramen shop has is that you can pick the fat level of the soup. And the soup was really hot. But even then i was disappointed. Even though the soup was yummy I would not come back. The 3 stars is really meant as a 2.5."}
{"text":"I went there on the weekend for lunch.  The taste is ok, and soup is just ok.  It is chicken broth which is a different from many other places that I went.  Usually I finish the broth at other places but not this place, it is like chicken broth with garlic in it.  Weird.  Something that I cook better at home.  The portion of the toppings on the noodles are sooooo little.  You get like 2 thin slices of meat and 1/2 eggs and a thin slices of fish cake.  Totally not worth the $11.  There are many other places in Markham/Richmond Hill that are better taste and better value.  Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is out near the beaches, so it was quite a trip for me since I took the 501.
It's probably one of the only ramen places in the area, but it definitely did not disappoint.

It's a pretty small restaurant with limited seating: a few seats up at the bar, a table near the front for larger groups, and a few high seats along the sides for two. There's a coat rack near the doorway, so feel free to use it if needed. Washrooms are clean and maintained, though they are a bit small (but then the whole place is kind of small anyways).

Most of their ramen bowls are $11 when I went. The usual shio and shoyu bowls that you find on most menus in most ramen places. There were a couple bowls at $13, but I ended up going with the Kyouka Ramen for $11 because their name was on it; of course, if they put their name on it, it must be good right? You have the option to choose your level of spicy and salty as well.

About 5 minutes later, bowls were served up. The size of the bowl is not too bad: it's a little bigger than what you'd get at a place like sansotei for example. The Kyouka ramen comes as it is presented on the menu: one piece of pork, one piece of chicken half an egg, wood ear mushrooms, bean sprouts, one piece of naruto fish cake, ... well basically what they wrote down. No mystery there.

The broth was heavy in flavour, and the noodles had time to soak in some of that goodness.
Definitely an enjoyable bowl, though if you're not a fan of salt you might want to get less salt in it.

We also got an order of chicken wings. It was deep-fried when our order was placed, so it's very hot when it arrives. Seasoned with sesame and pepper, it comes with a lot of flavour. You get 3 pieces for $6, which I feel is a bit too much for wings.

If you're in the area and craving ramen, Kyouka has you covered."}
{"text":"This place was opened this summer couple blocks from my work. So it's pretty new.

The decor is nice. Smart seating arrangements with  bar-like seats facing the cooks. I ordered Shio ramen from their menu and since I am fairly new to ramen I will stay away from commenting on it. 

I got the regular and the portion was well sized and served fast for someone who was out on lunch.

The staffs including the cooks greet you when you walked in and do the same when you leave which is a nice gesture.

Would visit this place again to try other ramen in their menu. And NO they do not provide takeout."}
{"text":"The shoyu ramen was great but it was salty and very oily.  The kyouka ramen soup base tasted like chicken noodle soup. The chicken wings were not all the hype at all. Just regular wings , tasted like those from Manchu wok. Although I'm not complaining about that ..yum lol . The slow cooked pork tendons donburi weren't great. Very fatty and not a lot of flavour.

Overall 3 stars for convenience. The store is very small , not much room to wait inside. 

A lot of white people go here, so that should tell you lots about the high reviews, just saying.  Not hating. The one review saying they realized this ramen place is different because there's no Chinese people in here is funny because if there were a lot of them you'd know it's good food at cheap prices. 

Toodles"}
{"text":"Karage wings are the best part of coming here.  Ramen is good. They don't have too many y options and you cannot get extra noodles. Restaurant is very clean and kid friendly. Their high chairs are very clean. Check in and get a free ice cream."}
{"text":"You choose how much fat you want in the broth and also the spice level. The more fat in the broth, the richer the flavour is. 
I ordered the kyoukka ramen with original fat and mild spice. I enjoyed the broth which was rich and full of flavour with the fat pieces in it. The mild spice was a small dallop of chili oil and it gave the ramen that extra spice that balanced out the oiliness feeling of the broth. 
The ramen had 1 slice of chicken and 1 slice of pork. The meat was flavourful and not dry but the slices were on the smaller side.
Not a big fan of the noodles that they had as they were not as chewy as I wanted for my ramen. 

The ramen had decent portion size ($11), enough to fill me up but it still left me with room to eat afterwards. The restaurant is small with limited seatings so it was more tight between each tables. 
Overall, this is a good ramen place to come to when you're in the area. The broth would be the main reason why I would come back to eat."}
{"text":"The Kyouka Ramen had edible kelp stock, daily chicken and pork broth, aromatic sesame oil, green chives, bean sprouts, pork and chicken chashu, egg, naruto fish cake, wood ear mushroom, and chili paste (mild or spicy or fire [+$0.50]).  I chose the \"less fat\" version of the soup and the \"mild\" chili paste.

I honestly didn't like the Kyouka Ramen.  I thought that the broth was too oily and the ramen noodles' texture was soft and not firm enough.  I didn't think that the addition of bean sprouts and leeks into the ramen made it a very authentic experience although they claim to be an authentic ramen shop.

We took our time dining in and I noticed that two tables down, one party had been waiting for their food for a long time but it didn't still arrive yet.  While we were there, there were also some customers waiting for a table too.  The restaurant was very packed!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant, I like the noodle & soup. Limited choices, soup is fat even with less fat option. Very small portion, lunch is ok but dinner is not enough. You can add more meat but not noodle. Consider location & price not very good value."}
{"text":"The soup is MSGed, too salty, the no fat ramen is still fatty, and the waitress mess up orders."}
{"text":"We kept passing this place and noticed that it was always packed, last night the stars finally aligned and we were able to enjoy some delicious ramen.  The space is clean, bright and vibrant, if not a bit smallish, but rest assured the service is super-speedy and the table turnover is fast, so you won't have to wait long.

We both ordered the kyouka ramen, and opted for the fully loaded option, which is double the toppings.  I had mine spicy and my wife ordered hers mild.  We both absolutely loved our ramen.  The Kyouka Ramen was a combination of both chicken and pork broth and the chicken chashu was perfect.  The portion sizes were amazing, we considered getting a side of karaage chicken wings, which looked incredible ( the table next to us ordered them), but I think we may have burst.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Happened to drive by and noticed this location. Pros: food is pretty good. Portions are good. Equal amounts of soup,noodle and meat. Cons: limited space. No change table for babies. Price seem a bit expensive. But overall, service and food was great. Probably come back."}
{"text":"A bit aways outside it the dt core lies this hidden ramen place. Place seats about max 30 people. 

Though it's far it's well worth the trek out east. 

I ordered the Kyouka Ramen which came with a rich broth and thicker than average noodles (thicker than kinton's). The noodles were chewy al dente and came in a large portion. What really stole the show was the slow cooked beef tendon donburi which came in a large size despite being a side dish. Tender tendons resting on a large bowl of rice sprinkled with raw green onion and ginger and a sheet of seaweed. Every bite of the bowl was delicious since the tendon sauce just seeped between the rice. 

I wouldn't say I'll come out east again just to go out but anytime I'm in the area you'll definitely find me here."}
{"text":"Casual place, tried the beef tendon don and chicken wings while bf got the Kyouka Ramen. Everything was pretty good, especially the chicken wings! The place is quite small but it's clean and service is pretty efficient. The noodles for the ramen are different than usual, on the thicker side but I found it interesting and pretty good!"}
{"text":"No MSG!   Full flavor!  Will come back!  
You all gotta try! Yum yum. 
Found this out that all their soups are made 100% with natural ingredients and simmer over many many hours.  Order the anchovy and the kyouka ramen.  I only returns the empty bowl. Ate all the Ramen and drank every last bit of soup.  I wasn't even thirsty afterwards.  I usually drink lots of water if there is MSG.  But not this time.  Definitely will be coming back for of their other soup flavors."}
{"text":"This is likely one of my fave ramen places in the city. Luckily it's in the East End :)

Its a small restaurant so space is tight and there is likely a line if you guy during peak hours.

People are friendly and the ramen is super tasty. The broth is really flavorful and the noodles seem fresh. I love the thickness of the noodles. Not too thick and not too thin.

I wanna try all their ramens!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here!

My family visited in late June on a drive from Niagara Falls to Cobourg. We stopped for a few hours for lunch and shopping and this area was perfect.

The day was rainy so ramen was the perfect lunch. Our daughter got the veggie mild ramen, our son the shoyu, I ordered the less fat, and my husband ordered the original spicy. We were all thrilled with our choices. Rich, deep flavors yet simple and satisfying. Fast, friendly service and quality ingredients made the entire visit excellent."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic. Not salty like a lot of the other ramen places around town. You have to try the chicken wings!"}
{"text":"I'll admit, up until visiting Kyouka my only experience with ramen was Mr. Noodle packets (and yes, usually dry). Boy what a world I had been missing. Absolutely delicious food, and incredible hospitality, Kyouka was quite the introduction to this delicious cuisine.

I had the Kyouka Ramen which is their specialty, and a mixture of both chicken and pork broth, and it was truly out of this world tasty. And the price is incredibly reasonable as well at only $11. 

Admittedly it's a little out of the way if you're downtown but definitely well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try the Ramen here for some time. Today Jill and I met for lunch  
I ordered a large warm sake Sho-Chiku-Bai and two orders of chicken wings while i waited for Jill. Got here early (which is typically me), the wings and Jill arrived at rhe same time. 

The wings were the best I've ever had, huge, meaty in a nice glaze with seasame seeds. The meat feel off the bone and were delish...3 to an order !! Yummy 

We each had Ramen - mine was \"loaded\" and really delish - mix of chicken & pork stock which hopefully decreased the Soyinka and Jill had the Kyouka Ramen which she really liked. 

All in all - GREAT Ramen and I'm coming back again soon !!"}
{"text":"Authentic taste and service. I love this place. $11 for the house ramen, and boy did I drink that broth from the bowl. It is possible that I enjoyed it that much extra because it was a cold day. 

The service was great, sitting at the bar to see your meal getting prepped is always nice when the chef can give you tips on what to order. Watching him prep, everything he did was with careful precision. 

My only small criticism is the meat, I prefer slightly fatty pieces of meat in my ramen."}
{"text":"Service was friendly, the ramen was okay. 

The broth is on the fattier and oily side with pieces of fat in it, if I were to order again I would suggest selecting \"less fat\". At first sight I had to get used to see the fat chunks in it. The broth was flavourful and the noodles were the perfect texture. Probably one of the better textures I've had. 
I appreciated getting 10% off with Yelp check in."}
{"text":"Their ramen is so freaking good! I got the Kyouka Ramen- not spicy, no fat, extra egg, add seaweed. It was the best ramen I've ever had! The wait staff incredibly nice and helpful. They were out of 4 types of ramen by the time I got there- I went around 9:15pm on a Friday. They had quite a bit of bar seating and could maybe accommodate 2 big groups."}
{"text":"I'm not a ramen expert but for me this place is just ok. The noodles had a nice bite but the broth was way too salty with no depth of flavour. There are better ramen joints in the city."}
{"text":"Occupying an awkward corner along Woodbine Ave is the latest of ramen joints to migrate upwards into the Asian invasion capital of Ontario. This place is brand spanking new and is still only open for dinner. Keeping up with that awkward location, the entrance is also awkward with two adjacent glass doors that can, if you wanted to, trap someone in between. It's also a tiny place and can fill up quite quickly.

What drew our attention was the fact that Kyouka was advertised as authentic Japanese ramen. Now I've never had ramen in Japan so I can't speak to that, but I can speak about it as a general consumer. And generally speaking, it's a decent ramen place. The portions are not as large as Sonoya's (Kenzo's) and the service isn't as fast as Sansotei's but it has its own charm. 

Kyouka ($11): You can customize the fat level (original, less fat, no fat). Even with \"less fat\", it was still plenty fat. There were little white pieces of \"flavour\" (some sort of animal fat) floating peacefully on top of the broth. But hey, you didn't come to ramen to keep slim, you came here to feel good with noodles! A friend also went for the spicier option of chili paste for an extra 50 cents and said it wasn't really that much spicier. 

Value for money was meh. Even with the fully loaded option with double toppings (+$4), it's not that fully loaded. I'm not sure it was worth it. The egg was delicious but you only get one full egg in the double topping option (otherwise just half). The meat was also good but you only get one piece of chicken and one piece of chashu in the original. And they're pretty thin pieces. 

Shio ($11): Shio means salt - so a salt based broth. And boy, was it salty. You also don't get to customize the fat level for this one and it looked and felt pretty greasy. Still a tasty ramen, but everything else combined, I think my health would protest against ordering this one again. 

Despite some issues, Kyouka is still a welcome addition to the Markham ramen scene and I can see it becoming popular as it settles into a good routine. Overall, the food isn't bad but it's not at the top of my go-to list. Everything was just a bit more expensive, a bit saltier, and a bit small compared to other options.

(72/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I came here when the restaurant just opened so perhaps the place has corrected some of its flaws, but with the price range I am hesitant to go back.

Broth was subpar, chicken meat was dry and lack flavour. Pork meat was decent but small. 

Ramen noodles were only soso in my opinion. 

There really was no element of surprise that would pull me back to trying the restaurant a second time. I am seeing quite a decent number of positive reviews, and I also heard good things about their other locations, but with so many other ramen places that opened up around Kyouka, I don't think I will come back to try it again any time soon."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this for a long time. Walked in and sat down. Waiter put a spoon and chopstick down. Spoon is watery from washing. One chopstick has paper stick to it. When the ramen came my bowl was little wet. I think they should wipe it or dry it before giving to the customer. I order a veg ramen and the soup had so much oil. Sorry to say but this is not a place for me."}
{"text":"\"The best authentic\" ramen: that statement is such a personalized experience that no one should feel bad expressing their honest feelings toward the food here. Important to read about  Kyouka ramen: it's a \"new-age Japanese ramen\" that \" pushed past the traditional boundaries and created a new and dynamic understanding of the making of ramen broth\" - excerpt from handout in restaurant.

THINGS I LOVED:
-Chili paste: not the bottled kind. On close examination you can tell it's home made. I could make a meal out of just this and their delicious rice.
-Rice: good rice can make anything taste better!
-Ramen noodle: nice texture and mouthfeel with a satisfying chew without being chewy. Would love to try this in one of their dry dishes.
-Chicken Cashu: oh so tender and surprisingly smoky DELISH!
-Spicy Chicken Donburi - tastes like they mixed their savoury chili paste with ground chicken OH MY!

TIPS:
- taste the broth right away if it's salty enough remove the black sheet of seaweed.
- The chili paste is spicy. Their \"mild\" spicy was medium to me. You can ask for it on the side then add it in yourself. 
- order the \"fully loaded\" version for $4 extra which doubles the toppings if you have a big appetite.
- you can order \"no fat\" if you find their soup too fatty.

They have made improvements from previous reviews:  coat rack by door but you can also put it on the back of your chair, we sat at the end of the bar by the door which was warm with no drafts (make sure no one's holding the door open) and nice jazz piano music in the background. There are a few menu items that you can order to go but not all. I did appreciate that they separated the soup from the noodles when they wrapped up my leftovers. Sweet attentive staff. Steady stream of both Asian and non-Asian customers alike coming here (Thursday lunch time)."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Waited 45 minutes for our food and noticed that other tables that came after us were already eating. We asked two different wait staff to follow up on our order. They did nothing - they didn't even bother checking with the kitchen. We walked out after an hour of nothingness. Never going back."}
{"text":"Very good ramen and broth. We had the anchovy broth ramen and the kyouka ramen. Only thing i would like was to have extra noodles because they're so good.

The meat is very tender, and the accompaniment veggies add a nice touch to something conventional. 

Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Small space and they don't take reservations. However if you call I had of time it will give you an estimate. The service was quick. The Ramen is delicious and don't be afraid to go for the \"spicy\" level! Chicken wings are also tasty and would recommend them as a starter."}
{"text":"Was delish...early growing pains with respect to service, but polite and appreciative.  Will be back."}
{"text":"So this was my first time trying Ramen and I quite enjoyed it. Was hoping to try a vegetarian ramen but only had time for take out and unfortunately they don't offer the ramen soups as take out only their appetizers and dipping ramen. So I tried the dipping ramen and Karage chicken wings. Loved the wings. So tasty, only 3 for $6 though seems kind of high, maybe 4 wings for $6 would be better especially if I want to share an order!  
The dipping ramen was full of flavour and I enjoyed it very much. I will be back to dine in so I can try the actual Ramen Soup. 
Hopefully they change the takeout menu to all Ramen dishes!  When we go for Pho takeout they just put the noodles and toppings in a container and the broth in a tub and it's easily transportable."}
{"text":"This little noodle house still has old-school stand up tables outside, reminiscent of old-time burger joint.  The decor inside is nice with a noodle bar.  We went on a Saturday around 12:15 for lunch and it we got the second last table.  The menu is pretty good with some choices.  The piri piri ramen intrigued me as I like a bit of spice.  I thought that the chicken slice tasted a bit like the smoked chicken you get at a deli shop though, and the chasu was ok.  The soup base was not that spicy so that even my 6 yo could eat it.  Overall, I liked the flavour and the noodles were thicker and flatter as opposed to the thin and thick noodles over at Sansotei.  Hubby got the Kyouka noodles and it was pretty good as well.
We decided to try the chicken karaage which was made using white meat and was pretty good.  The gyoza was a bit over-fried however.  
For drinks we ordered the hot mango green tea but was disappointed to spend that much on tea bags.
So, overall the food was ok.  We'd come back for that.

Service was a bit of a different story.  Our server must be a typical \"Millennial\".  She was pretty aloof in that she brought our hot teas and put them directly in front of our toddler.  Good thing I keep an eye on this kind of stuff, especially at a place that serves piping hot liquidy food and drinks.  I got those out of his way faster than she had put them down!  We added an order of the gyozas and she brought chicken wings instead.  We told her that we didn't order them and she said that the gyozas were ordered \"on top\" of the wings.  We told her that we never ordered wings.  *Dazed look* And she puts them on the table beside us.  When the bill came, again, she puts the bill in front of our toddler so I quickly move that.  She hands the machine for credit card to my husband and he pays.  As she leaves, she looks at us, and says \"Where's the plastic thing?\"  We both looked at her thinking, \"What plastic thing?  The whole table is full of plastic things (all the cutlery and dishes)\"  Clearly struggling with what she was trying to convey, she finally says, \"That bill holder thing.\" Ooooh. Wow.  I've never experienced that before."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Nice soup selections but the portions are a bit smaller in comparison to other places. Service is ok, but the small size of the restaurant makes it difficult to get a table to seat larger groups, as they dont take reservations. 

Chicken wings are very tasty but pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"I like this place!!!! 

My parents are not adventurous in the realm of food, so getting them to try ramen is a huge step for humanity. 

When I saw the 3.5 rating here, I was a bit iffy but I'm glad we came. I love that we could tweak the fat/oil/spicy levels for the Kyouka Ramen bowl, and it really does make a huge difference when you ask for \"less fat\" because you don't see the globules of fat floating in your soup. 

I also really liked the texture and thickness of the noodle. Most ramen places use that round, squiggly ramen, which is fine and dandy because it sure fills me up, but the flatter type of ramen they got here was wonderful and didn't make me feel bloated. Moroever, this flatter ramen holds the seasoning and soup better, meaning you get a party in your mouth when you eat it. 

Usually ramen places give you really fat chashu but this place was 85% lean!! 

So why a deduction? Please, do yourself a favour and NEVER get the shrimp tempura. They obviously didn't follow the 3-second rule because that shrimp came out more fried than the KFC I had 2 weeks ago. The batter was crunchy to the max, and it wasn't even lightly battered. It was like they wanted to see how much batter they could fit on the shrimp before the weight rips the body from the tail. $6 for 3 deep-fried shrimp is a total rip. 

Service was wonderful here and everyone was attentive. I like the quiet atmosphere that was here. 

Def recommend for ramen, and would love to come back. Don't order the tempura."}
{"text":"Love the ramen, perfectly done.  Portion is good and not too salty like many other ramen places I've had. I also had the black sesame ice cream and white berries tea after the meal. It was a nice addition.  Completed my meal.  Will definitely bring my family and friends!"}
{"text":"Man I loved their shio ramen so much when I was travelling in Toronto that I came back multiple times. Just such a nice salty broth and very well put together in terms of flavours. The noodle was springy and the toppings well balanced. The wait was long on a weekend night but good for lunch time. I really enjoyed myself and would go out of my way to come here again next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I have been craving ramen ever since I had come back from my trip in Japan and I was definitely satisfied went I went to Kyouka. That is a tall order, having had the best ramen i have ever had in Japan. Kyouka ramen serves up some delicious ramen that is different from the norm in a good way. 

I went on a weekend evening and the place was half empty (which is such a nice change from Sansotei nearby). I went with the kyouka ramen original and the beef tendon donburi to start. 

The donburi was interesting. If you like tendon then order this! This is mostly tendon, as it is like 95% tendon and 5% beef. The collagen of the tendon really comes through in its fibrous texture and the rice was sticky and vicious-like as a result. It was a nice simple dish. 

Now for the ramen. The noodles were okay, I certainly have had better but they get the job done here. The noodles were thin The broth was excellent as it was a combination of both pork and chicken broth for more depth. It was on the salty side but so was every single bowl of ramen ever. I can't help but talk about the fat where there are lots of comments about. If you don't want any, there is an option to get it fat-free. I went with the original for that maximum richness. There was a lot there but I don't drink all the broth so it wasn't too bad. The original non-loaded version had plenty of toppings (and those that the average ramen shop doesn't have like wood ear mushrooms!)  and I was also really impressed with their portion size, especially compared to sansotei's or Kiu's.

Lastly, checking in on yelp gets you a cup of black sesame ice cream which is a real nice touch of sweet after an umami overload!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and noticed this shop was once again a new restaurant. While I initially had a craving for Korean, I couldn't find parking at the busy First Markham Place and was glad as I ended up coming here for a late lunch.

I entered the restaurant at 1:30pm to cozy, clean and modern interior. They have several tables and some counter seating in front of the kitchen. I was promptly greeted and took a counter seat. After a few min I ordered the Karaage, Shoyu Ramen and a Kirin.

The Karaage was good. The batter was light and slightly crispy and the chicken was done perfectly, tender and juicy on the inside. I enjoyed the Shoyu Ramen which came with pork, chicken, half egg (medium boiled), and green veg. The (soy) broth was very good and the ramen noodles were great.

This was a very good experience overall. Great food, good service, nice environment. Give it a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Haven't come back for almost 2 years. Never bother to travel to downtown while they have a second shop in Markham. Though it is authentic, I consider this is a second tier ramen shop, as their quality really deteriorates over time. The place is quite small, so it is definitely not for large groups. 

I ordered the tsuke ramen ($11), while my wife ordered the house ramen ($11). They don't have an option to get more noodles which is a bummer, as my wife and I usually share a large order. They have something called fully loaded ($15) which doubles the toppings, however, I am here for the ramen, not necessary the toppings, yet another disappointment.

For this type of Japanese comfort food, it's best to pair with beer, especially Japanese beer. Sadly, they only have two options to choose from, bottle Sopporo ($6.50) or Sleeman ($4.50), as you might already know, both are domestic beer and no taps. Why would I pay $6.50 for a domestic beer in a bottle? Another thumb down.

Tsukemen:

They separate the soup from the noodles and toppings. The soup is a little thicker than the regular soup base, simply because it is supposed to be used as a noodle sauce. The ramen noodles were thicker than the one I tasted 2 years ago, however it's perfect for this type of sauce based ramen. I would have liked it better if the soup or sauce were hotter. Since the noodles were served cold, it easily turns the sauce lukewarm. I suggest to finish the serving in 5 minutes or less. I found the sauce a little bit on the salty side, but I do like the chili paste which adds a kick to the whole experience."}
{"text":"Decent ramen especially for this part of town. Fully loaded for only $4 is the way to go if you can eat that much. Lost a star because in arrival I asked to sit at a table around the corner from the door and they said they were saving it for four. The table are for two but can be moved together for bigger groups. I can normally live with this except the restaurant never filled in, we were the only two at the bar, there's no blockage between the cold air coming in where we were seated AND they let two other people sit there later on!!"}
{"text":"Quality has been going downhill :( the tsukemen was not good. The noodles were too mushy for my taste. The broth was a little bland and too runny for the noodles to grab onto. I remember a couple years ago when it recently opened I was blown away by how flavourful the broth was. Did the head chef/owner leave? What happened??!"}
{"text":"Overall Experience: 

First Impression
============
Nice friendly staff, clean.

Food
=====
I like my ramen broth as rich as possible, and to have a nice mouth feel (thicker).

We ordered their signature: Kyouka
- Ramen was a thicker noodle and was cooked well!
- Soup had a strong ginger taste, I don't like the taste of ginger, but I t didn't ruin the soup for me personally but it overpowered any other flavours that might have been there.

We also ordered the Piri Piri
- Noodles again were great!
- Soup was a thin broth.
- Flavour was ok... I don't dislike it but I would not order this one again.

We ordered fried chicken wings
- Delicious!
- Wish I had a beer to go with it!
- And sorry we finished the wings before I remembered to take a photo...

Service

Friendly staff and made you feel welcomed!  What more could one ask for.

Would I come back
===============
Yes I'd come back for another try to see if the ginger flavour was a one-off thing or a style they have."}
{"text":"Kyouka Ramen opened their second store in the heart of Markham!  I never been to the one in downtown so I can't really compare the ramen between the two stores, but comparing to other ramen places in Markham, Kyoyka Ramen is a great option!

Came here on a weekday with 2 of my bros and this place is relatively small for Markham standards.  It only has around 6 tables and a TINY parking lot, but the good news is, that parking lot is only for that restaurant so parking shouldn't be an issue.

I ordered the Fully Loaded Shio Ramen, The Fully Loaded option comes with double of every toppings so it was a great size for me.  I wish they would also offer double noodle option but they don't have it.  Ramen itself is very good; noodles have great texture and chewy, the pork bellies were very tender and tasted great!  Only negatives I have about the ramen is the soup base is a little salty compare to other ramen places, but the server already warned me the Shio is a little saltier.  But for my standard, it is still acceptable.

We also ordered wings which was very good!  $6 for 3 chicken wings with an interesting chashu sauce and they were great size and tasted great!  Overall, great experience at Kyouka, fully deserves the 4 stars.

** Make sure you check-in on yelp to redeem your free ice cream (Green tea or Black Sesame) before it discontinues!!!"}
{"text":"About $15,00 for a good lunch set, including a small amount of salmon, tempura , rice and soul in a takeaway box was enjoyable enough.  Took a few minutes to prepare from fresh, and could tell that a lot of care was taken into preparation of the sushi roll. The salmon a bit of a let down, with only a few bite sized pieces which one may expect more for the price point. However, overall a worthy entry into the quick sushi lunch and takeaway in woodbine across from the Cosco."}
{"text":"Solid four stars in terms of food and price. 4.5 stars for service and atmosphere!
I am glad I found this place because there isn't much to choose from in east Toronto when it comes down to ramen (or even any restaurants...). No need to line up for some popular ramens shops in dt anymore!!!! 
A small, simple but modern place to slurp some delicious noodles! AND it is run by Japanese. Very friendly service, a generous amount of food (by far the largest portion of ramen I had in the GTA), but most importantly, the taste was there! To be fair, I didn't have high standards walking into this place thinking, 'I would have known about this place if it were to be that good.' I was wrong. I will def be back soon to try different ramens. I had a limited time menu which was brothless (hope they make this a regular item). My bf ordered shio ramen with pork in (large size), and it was a good bowl of ramen. 

Yes, I would recommend this place to anyone. Oh almost forgot to mention that it is located right next to ed's real sccop FYI How about grab a bowl of ramen and cool off with some ice cream? :D"}
{"text":"This is the best Ramen I've had in the city.  The Kyouka ramen was the most flavourful broth ever."}
{"text":"This place doe not disappoint and is super busy all the time!  The service is fast and efficient but you never feel rushed out the door.  The place is small and they don't take reservation and your entire party must be with you at the time of sitting down.  The food is great, fresh and made to order for picky eaters.  This is a gem for sure!!"}
{"text":"First impression, staff was friendly and attentive. Small area, more suited for smaller parties.

Got the following:

Shio ramen - Intense clam flavour paired with green onion brought out the umami flavour, soup not too fatty, could be just slightly less salty. Cha siu and chicken were perfect in texture and both taste. Marinated egg had a good consistency for the yolk. Noodles are fresh with a good mouthfeel. Second favourite dish.

Karaage wings - Light starch based batter, which is always a bonus. Tebasaki styled, could be slightly more spicy. 

Kyouka donburi - Not too exceptional, had the chicken and cha siu from Shio ramen but not a necessarily 'must order' item

Spicy chicken donburi - Great surprise, chicken was marinated well, was not dry in any way. There was ra-yu in the chicken which dripped to the bottom of the bowl and made it really delicious, not to mention the marinated egg. My personal favourite!"}
{"text":"??????downtown????????????markham????????costco???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my wife for the very first time. Really enjoyed the food. This place must be a hidden gem as it was completely full for lunch. Everything was good and appreciated how clean the restaurant was!"}
{"text":"Occasionally, a ramen store will put a ramen as its signature dish. Often times it's a disappointment, as it fails to compare to the staple 4: shio shoyu miso spicy.

The Kyouka ramen is good for one reason: the soup. The toppings are all as you'd expect: up to the appropriate standards; varied textures. But the soup is a delightful take on a kind of abominable child between the staple soups. I've taken my soup spicy(they provide an option on how spicy you want it to be), and it was appropriately heavy. Emphasis on the appropriately.

The signature dish is deliberate, and methodically put together. It's worth not only the price but the tip that you'd put on top of the tab.

Go there, have your experience yourself and tell others about it. It really is the best *signature* ramen that I've experienced thus far.

Kyouka Ramen:
**soup:10/10
noodles:6/10
toppings:8/10

**it's good enough to break the integrity of any review"}
{"text":"Mediocre ramen.  Not authentic.
Ordered a shio ramen, broth was very oily and salty. Wish the waitress would advise on the oilyness of the broth.  Cha Siu was very dry.
Same with the Dipping ramen, dry cha Siu. Portion was small compare to other ramen places that serves tsukemen.  They also put this Szechuan style chili paste into the broth to make it spicy, doesn't taste very Japanese at all.
Ordered a kyouka donburi for my kid, they diced up some pork fat and sprinkled on top of the rice.  People who loves pork fat might like it, but not for us.

Only their chicken wing tasted good from the whole meal. $6 for 3 full wings deep fried with some kind of special soya sauce.  Can't complain with this price.

Dont think we will come back for ramen again.  Many alternate choices in the area."}
{"text":"Even the coveted Beaches area can't escape the ramen hype train. Yes, it has begun; the one and probably only ramen place for all you beach goers, east-downtowners, outcasts... a crowd soon to include me of course. :D This just be my go-to ramen joint as it's only minutes from my place (soon-to-be).

This is ramen with a Chinese twist to it. From the Cha-su that reminds me of a traditional Chinese bbq joint to the green onions in the soup that I am very fond of and alas an available Chicken broth stock broth that is all too familiar. It is instantly recognizable and welcoming. I know, I know you may question my credibility as a reviewer but remember food doesn't always have to be authentic to taste great.

The broth (chicken or pork) is rich and tasty although not quite as rich as some of the champions like Sansotei. The meats are very tender and pretty tasty. The only criticism is that the pork broth has too many lard bits in it. Also the portions are fairly small for the price. As most have mentioned, the wings are very delicious albeit they can be a little crispier and the texture of the meat is a little unnaturally silky (they probably sous-vide it before frying).

Wow, that was a lot to digest. Anyhow, it's a worthy visit if you are in the east end."}
{"text":"Ehh what's with the low rating so far.. I liked this place! haha 
I came here on a weeknight with my family to try out their ramen. Service was great.

GRILLED CHICKEN WINGS (4/5)
I liked the sauce they had for the chicken wings. I think they marinated the chicken wings before grilling it because the meat inside had a lot of taste too :)

KYOUKA RAMEN (4/5)
I had the original soup broth with mild spice. I liked this because it wasn't salty. Very flavourful soup base. It was a bit oily but not to a point where I felt icky afterwards. I chose this ramen because this is supposed to be their signature ramen from the menu.

Note: 
The portion for the \"donburis\" are pretty small.. my dad had to order another ramen because he wasn't full off of the rice bowl itself haha so be warned! :D"}
{"text":"I'm going to go with a well rounded, solid 3 star on this, but please note it's a TOTAL 5 STAR FOR SERVICE! :)

It's a really small restaurant location but super convenient for me because of where I work. There's not much parking but you can park on the Perth St. just along the side. Of course this translates to not much seating inside either so I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for large parties.. Just maybe a quick meal with a few people.

We ordered anchovy ramen which had amazing flavour.. you can DEFINITELY taste anchovies so might not be for everyone. I enjoyed it though. We also got the Shoyu Ramen. Pretty good, but one of ours had some bits of what looked like rock/sand. I think a utensil broke or maybe it really is rocks.. anyway that wasn't pleasant to bite into, but the staff were really quick to help us get a fresh bowl. We really appreciated the quick attention to remedy the situation. 

I ordered the dipping ramen. It looked really interesting so I figured I'd give that one a try. It has a nice flavour and not too salty, but oh my goodness it was VERY oily. I had a hard time eating it through all the oil (which also isn't great for digestion). Maybe you can order it with less oil?

Towards the end of the meal, a staff came by and gave us a complimentary plate of Gyoza for the troubles with the Shoyu Ramen we had. It was very kind of them! 

Price wise, this place is a bit higher than other ramen restaurants near by. But I think they do it with a lot more heart and and pride than many other mass producing chain style restaurants. 

Definitely check this place out and try for yourself. 
The staff are absolutely amazing!!"}
{"text":"They prepare the noodles with love.  I hope it becomes less busy because the place is small and no where to stand and wait.    

Be careful with the vegetarian ramen.   Made with Chicken broth."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on labor day.  
Ordered a Kyouka ramen, chicken wing and beef tendon rice.

Overall, it's an ok place for lunch.  
Service is very friendly.

Taste wise, i expect better.
Ramen: Pork/chicken stock is fatty, but not very tasty or flavorful.  The egg is done right.  The pork (Chasu) is not flavorful and chewy. The chill tasted like XO sauce, which doesn't blend in with the ramen very well.  For the price of $11-12 for a bowel of noddle, I didn't think the taste justify the price.

Chicken Wing: The skin flavor is good.  However, the chicken wing may be too big, that the inside of the wings is not that flavorful.

Beef Tendon Rice: The best dish.  Slow cook Beef tendon with rice is always a great match.  It's the standard recipe of soy sauce, mirin, sake, and ginger probably slow cooked for 4 hours.  Very similar to the Chinese/Taiwanese cooking of it, except it has mirin and it's on the sweet side, with less spice.  

Ice cream: The black sesame ice cream taste great.  It could have been in the freezer for too long or too cold, it has too much ice crystal on top.  

Honestly, I won't come back for ramen.  However, the Beef tendon rice is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Sooooo good!!!! Had the Kyouka Ramen and you can choose fat level and spice level. The house made spicy sauce that it came with was delectable. Soup base was phenomenal and the pepper added a nice pungency. My dad had the Shio Ramen, which he said was the best ramen he has ever had. Even better than the ones in Japan.  

Love their take on the chicken wings (full wing), which came with the winglette, drum and wing. They were crispy and flavorful. Service was courteous and attentive. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Saw the reviews for the dt location and thought since they could expand the stores it can't be that bad....

So today we went. It's a Friday night at 7pm ~30 degree outside.
When we went in, it was like a sauna...
We didn't have to wait long before we were seated.
Only then we found out that there's actually AC but super weak. A fan would be cooler. 

Ok so onto the food. We ordered two original kyouka ramen, one spicy one mild. 
Soup was actually fragrant and the noodles arent bad. But 

the soup was super oily. It's very not appetizing to see so much fat floating around...
And you only get one small piece of chicken breast and one small piece of pork... So pathetic. They weren't even \"cha shiu\"....
Overall very little ingredient

I would expect a $11 at least similar to sansotei or other comps....

So yeah..... Nope....I'm not going back... Definitely not in the summer."}
{"text":"The tendon rice OMG soooooo good!  A must try!!! I loved it!!!  Noodles were good, soup base was good not as salty as other Japanese ramen places which is a plus.  No line up, convenient location, quick service.  Recommended"}
{"text":"There are not many authentic Japanese restaurants in the East end of the Toronto, which makes Kyouka a great addition to the area. The restaurant is small, with 3 tables and about 10 bar seats. Don't worry as the restaurant recommends that Raman should be eaten within 7-8 mins so you won't need to wait long for a table (they won't kick you out if you go over the recommended time! LOL). The atmosphere is relaxed and warm. Staff are very friendly and service is quick. 

I will say the ramen was delicious! We ordered the Kyouka Ramen, which was different than your typical, made of chicken AND pork both, with bits of fat that add a nice rich flavour to the broth. The bowl includes a slice of smoked chicken and chashu. My only complaint is that the egg yolk is boiled too hard for my liking of a Japanese marinated egg. 

Chicken wings here are a must order, moist, tender and crispy. The are dipped in a light mirin and chashu sauce. Order this early as it can take up to 15 mins as they are battered to order. 

Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"We ordered the shio ramen (which is clam based) and the anchovy flavoured ramen. I felt the anchovy ramen was very flavourful and not too seafood-y tasting. The shio ramen was not too flavourful to me. It was too light flavoured. 

Also, I felt the char siu was nothing special. Actually, it kind of tasted a bit like a cooked ham vs a real char siu."}
{"text":"After driving by this place several times, I've been repeatedly checking the grand opening day online, hoping for a new lunch spot close to work! I came here for lunch with a group of 6 coworkers and just to be safe we arrived at 11:30 to avoid any lines. It's a good thing we did, shortly after noon the line started to form. This is quite a small restaurant as well, however a ramen meal is pretty quick, I wouldn't imagine the wait to be too long. 

I ordered the Kyouka ramen. I didn't have high expectations to begin with as they didn't have my usual tonkotsu go to broth. This one was a chicken broth and it even had a slice of chicken and pork instead of the pork belly. To my surprise it was very tasty! I enjoyed the broth the most, it was nice and rich as well had small chunks of fat. The ramen had a nice smokey flavour to it which I quite like. I also enjoyed the toppings, the chicken had a nice smokey taste to it, the pork was not as fatty as I like however it was still very good and soft, as well I enjoyed the leeks and dabble of spice that they place on top of the ramen. The downfall was the noodles, I felt the noodles could be better or a little more chewy. 

All in all, will definitely return for this ramen and looking forward to trying the chicken wing karaage next time!"}
{"text":"We were really excited to go to this restaurant because it sounded interesting and the menu sounded great and included vegetarian options. 

Just to be sure we even took the time to call ahead to ensure that the vegetarian Ramen was available. However when we got there we were told that it was simply a chicken broth with vegetables instead of vegetables and meat. What made it annoying was the fact that we traveled across town to get there. Most Ramen restaurants include a miso option however in this case the term vegetarian seems to be lost on them. We even suggested options for the soup but they were not accommodating.

We definitely cannot recommend this restaurant to any vegans or vegetarians."}
{"text":"The service here is awful. Due to the limited seating, they rush you like you're not welcome to stay more than 10 minutes. They will even take your bowl away from you before you're done eating. Parking space is also limited and the location is awkward.

The food is okay, nothing out of ordinary.
With all the Ramen choices in the area there's no reason to come here."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this little shop that took over what I believe used to be a coffee time in a strip plaza that can be easily overlooked. I hunted down this restaurant because I was craving ramen and needed to eat in that area before my appointment nearby.

There isnt' a ton of seating, maybe enough for about 30 ppl including the seats at the bar. We didn't have to wait for a table so that was nice since I was tight on time. Staff were friendly and did give us some advice when we asked about the different broth options for the ramen. In the end, my husband ordered the Shio ramen and I ordered the Kyouka ramen. We also ordered an appetizer - the Karaage chicken bites (we were debating between that and the gyoza and thought this might be the better choice. We were not disappointed.

The Karaage chicken bites were quite delicious. flavour was definitely there, it wasn't too salty - I was also really hungry at that point so I just started to devour those chicken bites. I generally like popcorn chicken- type dishes so it's no surprise that I would like the dish. But the batter was light and crispy, and the chicken was tender enough inside, a great start to the meal!

I tried some of the broth of the shio ramen.. but I think I liked my broth better - although the shio did have a very strong clam broth taste so if you like that flavour profile I think the Shio would be good. My husband isn't really a seafood guy, so after he tried both broths, he thought mine was better. I selected less fat option and I was quite happy with that choice - I think if i picked the higher fat options it might be too rich for my liking.

I'm used to liking thick broths for my ramen, hence naturally I picked the Kyouka since i'ts pork bone broth. I like that it comes with two pieces of meat, pork and chicken. Both were quite nice, and I liked the ramen texture, flavours were good - well balanced and none of the ingredients overpowered each other. The noodles are a little wider than the ones i usually eat, but they were cooked to perfect texture and I liked the hint of \"springyness\" that the noodles had. Portions overall I thought were quite good for the price point - there was quite a bit of noodles in there, so I thought it was pretty good value.

Overall I was quite surprised at the ramen - I walked in not expecting much because I just needed somewhere to go, but after this I think next time I'm in the neighbourhood I might stop by for another bowl of the Kyouka ramen.. and perhaps double topping this time :)

p.s. If you check in on yelp while you're at the restaurant, they do offer a 10% discount, which I did use :) However, my yelp app resetted after a while so by the end of the meal the deal disappeared because I didn't choose to redeem now or save for later :( But the manager was very nice and she gave me the 10% after I told her what happened!"}
{"text":"Overall 3.5 stars.

I had an anchovy shoyu ramen.  The texture of the noodle was not al dente, which I prefer, but it was still substantial to the bite.  It was very slippery, which I like very much.  If you don't mind the anchovy flavor, the broth was good.  It tasted different from regular soya sauce based and pork/chicken based broths.  It was rich yet drinkable.  As opposed to some reviewers, I didn't find the broth too oily.  Then maybe it is because anchovy shoyu broth is not as oily.  The egg and meat didn't make much of an impression, yet the garlic and green onions did.  They added an aroma and a tiny lift to the otherwise flat broth.

It is evident that the chef puts an effort in creating unique broths.  I am interested in trying a vegetarian broth next time."}
{"text":"I've never had a good ramen like this for long time.

The slow cooked beef tendon is crazy delicious!!! The beef was melted in my mouth. In Heaven!

I'll come back for sure."}
{"text":"A very very solid 3 out of 5. Perhaps having been to Japan and trying ramen over there has spoiled my pallet, but I found the food here generally underwhelming unfortunately. 

We were very pleasantly greeted and served through out the meal, so service is what saved this experience. The bowls of noodles are in the smaller side compared to other ramen places.

Noodles were a good texture, and broth was tasty but had lots of chunks of fat floating around. Usually the fat should create a nice thick, milky broth, but this broth seemed to be chunky. Also, usually meat for ramen are usually large pieces. For some very odd reason the meat here was served diced. 

The tendon rice was very tasty. Tendon was nice and juicy, and gave the rice a nice sticky tast texture.

I wanted to like this place but actually left a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"We got the Kyouuka original and the Shiso one, and the chicken wings. The soup is clearly covered in what I assume is garlic oil. As much as I love my garlic, the oil just spoiled the whole bowl. The meats were lean, and though it easilt breaks apart in your mouth, its overdone with a dry texture and again, very salty.

I was pretty excited to try it, and left pretty disappointed.

I would come back again just to try their spicy option and the cold noodles with dipping sauce since its nearby, but the saltiness is offputting.

The chicken wings were salty as well but delicious!"}
{"text":"The noodles are different than what's out on the market. I would however, prefer noodles that are a bit more chewy, although that's a personal preference. The soup base is amazing and what you get for the price is the bang for the buck. We tried the fully loaded Kyouka ramen and the Veggie Shio Ramen. Both tasted well. We added a dipped ramen and found to be less fond of it than the rest. It probably would've tasted better if the noodles were chilled. 

The service was good. When we identified that the Kyouka ramen was missing the extra toppings as per the \"fully loaded\" edition, the waitress got us a bowl with the missed toppings and apologized. I think the experience could be improved if she had told us she was going to get the missed toppings rather than simply acknowledging it and moving on. We had no idea if she went to get more toppings or if we would be left in the cold.

One draw back of this place is the limited space. The location of the bar tables were too close to tables near by.  There was next to no space to get past other patrons in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of ramen but this place definitely was disappointing for me. 

I ordered the Shoyu Veggie Ramen (Spicy) but wasn't impressed. It wasn't spicy at all, broth was bland and very oily - I could barely stomach the broth. The vegetables lacked flavour and was just meh. 

There are a couple of ramen where you can choose - original fat, less fat and no fat. Boyfriend chose original fat and the broth was overwhelming with fat and oil. It was not a rich flavour instead it felt too greasy of a broth to enjoy. 

Service was frustrating. We were asked twice within two minutes if we were ready to order. It wasn't very busy so maybe they were just impatient but I felt rushed to order. 

I would not come back here, there are much better ramen places in the area."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Kyouka is a newcomer for the recent increase of ramen restaurants in Markham. I recently gave this place a try after passing by it, originally thinking Big Jack's was still at that location.

The place was quite full for a Tuesday at 9pm, but it could've been because of the hype behind this place. It's ramen, everyone loves it, and they wanna be one of the first to try!

I had the Kyouka Ramen, original. I know some people complained about the abundance of fat even when they ordered less fat, but seeing how photos showed the broth being quite light in general, I decided to go for the creamyness.

Food came out rather slow, but not unbearably slow. The portions were good; not Kinton level good, but more than Sansotei/Touhenboku quantity. The ramen was different from the ones I'm used to, but I generally liked it. The broth was definitely creamy, and I can see where people would complain about the fat as there was quite a bit oozing once I completed my meal.

Service was great even though it was a bit slow, you can tell they were understaffed for a Tuesday night. It's definitely better than Touhenboku IMO, but Markham's ramen experience just isn't up to par with its neighbour down south yet."}
{"text":"So excited to have a ramen spot in the beach especially such a delicious one!! Very reasonably priced broth is delicious and noodles perfect consistency. Bring winter on, I found my cold weather comfort food!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! My friend and I both are like the noodle, which like homemade stretched noodle; the stock was very tasty, rich,natural umami, should be simmered an amount of time.and there are open kitchen is nice&clean.overall, nice ramen noodle restaurant,I will be their frequent visitor :)"}
{"text":"I came with granny for Ramen during lunch on a business day.  Menu selection is limited at this visit.  The noodles tasted good was had great consistency but the soup covered with a thick layer of oil.  That could be from the sesame oil and other aromatic ingredients.  Ordered Shio Ramen original for granny and she said that there wasn't enough toppings.  I ordered the Kyouka Ramen original and that was OK.  Server recommended their famous chicken wings and  we found them to be on the dry side.  I checked in on yelp and got an order  for a free scoop of ice cream, but the server brought it right away,  when I was still having the hot noodles in soup!!!!!  It was half melted after I battled through my food.  Service was OK otherwise, although I heard Mrs boss yelling at staff behind the servery counter for their service quality multiple times during the 30-minute visit.  Expected green tea as table drink instead of the regular water provided.  Cleanliness is  good  overall."}
{"text":"Not bad I like the noodle, the soup is flavourful but is too fatty lots of fat floating on it. And personally i think add $4 to double the toppings is not that worth it, because they give 3 small pcs of pork and if you add the double of toppings only gives u extra 3pcs and some extra bean sprouts and chives for $4, thats not really worth it lol.  They should have more appetizers to choose from in the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef tendon rice for $5 and it is amazing. I like how they cooked it so tender and sticky. My husband order the kyuoka ramen original spicy and the soup taste really good. We also ordered gyoza and shoyu ramen.

The soup taste really good unlike any other ramen place I have tried. Service is great. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I got the dipping noodles here and it was quite nice. The booth is pleasant with a lot of guilty fat bubbles!
I find its noodle texture better than Sansotei's thick noodles.
The meat (chicken / pork cha siu) are so lean that it's drier than jerky, but the noodles and broth does make up for it.
Chicken wings are very tasty as well.
Overall, I think Sansotei is slightly better for its soup and toppings; but this place has no line, EVER! So this is now my spot for ramen cravings if I don't feel like lining up."}
{"text":"great food, great staff i can barely communicate with the chef cause he is really japanese 
so you know  your getting real ramen

I would recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Fantastic ramen.  My husband likes it better than Santouka!  We both had the Kyouka ramen, chicken wings and I had the tendon donburi.  My 3 Year old son ate it all up too!  It came super quickly and the staff were so friendly.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday night. As I have been eating a lot ramen this month. I wanna have some dipping noodles and my friend picked the Kyouka ramen. Both of them are served in chicken +pork broth.

There is several options for the chicken +pork broth. 
You can pick fat, less fat and no fat. For ladies who are in a diet, I would recommended to go for no fat. Trust me! ( ; 
There is also a spiciness level for your chili paste as well.
The sweet part is you can ask them to put the chili paste on side. They are super cool with it. 

This is not a traditional ramen that you would have in the other ramen stores in downtown. Instead, it is more of a contemporary ramen. Compare to the other ramen place I have been too, Kyouka Ramen wins our hearts just like our hidden gem ramen store in Etobicoke, Nobuya. 

Before we left, we also want to try their donburi and dessert. (We are definitely gonna gain weight for this trip.) So we ordered the beef tendon tonburi and green tea ice cream. 
Both are amazingly delicious. I wish I could move to this neighbourhood so that I can have them every week. Oh! Remember to pay a visit to the Ed's Real Scoop that is couple stores nearby. You would love it!"}
{"text":"Time for another episode of Leslie's very popular and anticipated Yelp Pros and Cons!

I had the kyouka ramen and then later tried the tsukemen dipping ramen.

Pros: 
Authentic Japanese ramen restaurant with a Japanese chef straight outta Comp.. er... Tokyo. Ironically, this location used to be one of those fake non-Japanese sushi restaurants and then a fish and chips place.
Very clean premises owing to its recent opening
Location: bringing authentic Japanese cuisine to an area without one (i.e. not downtown)
Counter seating where one can enjoy seeing the chef in action and the pots, pipes, steam and the works, which is the authentic ramen restaurant set up. In Toronto Santouka and Kinton have this lay out. Sansotei, Ryus, etc. do not. Ramen restaurants have to feature open concept kitchens.
Polite servers who smile and are happy to be of service
Chasu: melt-in-your-mouth pork and chicken
Ajitama: the perfect just-rightly boiled ramen egg - too bad they give you half instead of a whole one
The soundtrack to Ghibli anime on the speakers

Cons:
(Now mind you I am biased because my personal favourite broth is pork) the chicken.pork broth mix is oily and not as fragrant as tonkotsu pork broth. It always amazes me that people find pork broth heavier than chicken broth. Once again, I found the chicken broth very oily here (like Touhenboku's broth - although Kyouka is much better than Touhenboku. I would return to Kyouka, but would not return to Touhenboku whose broth is just strange). 
Tsukemen was not deliciously fishy like Ryus. The fish broth tsukemen at Ryus is the best. Kyouka's was missing sesame too.
The fishcake naruto and chasu were so thinly cut I felt like they use a deli meat cutter. 
Small location needs to be expanded.
Didn't order zinga appetizer as it was 3 for $6
No Japanese staff except for the owner himself

The broth was not so good, the noodles were very standard, but at least thick which I like and the atmosphere felt strange and out-of-place until I noticed it is because there were no Chinese customers in the restaurant. I thought as soon as an authentic Japanese restaurant or business opens our Chinese-Canadian friends would line up but not here! It was fun watching the chef create the ramen bowls with care and style...
One last comment: the ramen is available in regular/mild, spicy and suicide spicy flavours. Those who know ramen know that it should not be eaten as spicy. Spicy ramen helps kill the taste buds, which is not what real food/ramen lovers would do."}
{"text":"What a surprising find! We didn't have any expectations coming in, but the Kyouka Ramen was out of this world! The broth was flavourful and creamy. My significant other ordered the shoyu ramen and the broth was not as favourful as the Kyouka, hence 4 stars. Overall? We'll definitely be back! We plan on ordering the fried chicken and gyoza next time."}
{"text":"The ramen served here is so way off compared to many of the Japanese ramen in GTA. The taste of the soup and ramen seems to have a Chinese undertone to their flavour. To me this was like an imitation ramen; where the flavour is lacking in the soup. The flavour mostly came from the condiments (salt, chives, egg, etc..). Comparing their \"original\" vs the \"less fat\" the only difference was the amount of fat gelatin in the soup.  That was also the odds thing, why was the fat in gelatin? If the flavour is in that fat, shouldn't it be dissolved in the soup at the least? 

The overall taste was a rip off, it's like asking a Chinese to eat at a \"Chinese\" restaurant that served fried rice, sweet and sour pork,  fried chicken balls and fortune cookies. If this was suppose to be a spin off of something Japanese it spun off in the wrong direction."}
{"text":"Great ramen joint.  Having tried most ramen places in the city,I really appreciate that each has their own flavour. Kyouka definitely branches out with the chicken slices and clam soup base. Yum!!! I like the toppings of the namesake ramen but the soup is too fatty for me. I prefer the clam soup base which is lighter and I love the option of a veggie ramen when you don't feel like meat at lunch. It's packed with delicious crunchy veg blanched in soup. (it's not a vegetarian soup though for those that care).  
The tendon rice is good, the wings need a bit of work (too oily when I tried it). The hours are a bit short though... The lunch window can use a bit of extension on the weekend? Overall recommend."}
{"text":"Craving for ramen on a cold Friday night and stumbled upon this place on yelp (other ramen places in downtown seemed to be packed). There was no line around 9pm on a Friday night. We ordered two kyouka ramen and the chicken wings appetizer to share. Highly recommend the chicken wings here! They were crispy, flavourful and different than your regular karage. The $11 kyouka ramen came with chicken chasiu, half a soft boiled egg, and some veggie toppings. You can customise the amount of fat and spice level. The chicken chasiu was a little dry but the noodles were pretty good.

The location is a little inconvenient for us, not sure if we will come all the way again for a bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"My go-to ramen spot in the city, not just the east end.  I literally hit this place up once a week with the entire family.  My favourite is the dipping ramen with an order of wings - font knock em til you try them!  Service is on point as well."}
{"text":"Really fantastic remen, especially the remen noodle and the soup. This restaurant must be one of the most recommended in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love the ramen here... very authentic and the soup base is delicious and pipping hot...the way it should be.  The regular size bowl ($11) seems small and the larger one ($15) just have double the toppings with the same amount of ramen.  An option with more ramen would be nice.  Anyhow, love this place.  Wish they have one of those ramen ticket machines like in Japan which would make the experience even more authentic and fun :o)"}
{"text":"Went to Kyouka for the first time a couple of days ago and won't be going again. The stars are for the friendly and attentive service. However, the food is what counts most and that fell short. I ordered the Kyouka house special ramen. The noodles were soggy and not chewy and firm like traditional ramen places. The broth tasted fine, but the sight of it turned me off. I ordered the \"regular fat\" level (alternatives are less fat and no fat), thinking the flavour would be more rich. Nope. There were tiny pieces of white stuff floating in my soup, which was literally lard. It looked like the place just ladled fat on top of the soup. There was no richness, only added grease. The egg was also messy and not done well, but it tasted fine. I appreciated the mushroom topping, but that is no where near enough to make me go back. My husband ordered shoyu ramen, which has soy sauce in the broth. It only tastes like soy sauce. He was not impressed."}
{"text":"Food was even better than what I expected , I was well done and service was amazing . Is a small location so it gets really packed quick. I will so recommend to come to this restaurant if you want to experience well done and authentic ramen."}
{"text":"The broth is not traditional because it is chicken based, but it is damn good. The chef takes pride in his craft and the food shows it. 

My 5 star rating does not reflect a beaches bump, it really is one of the better tasting ramen shops in the GTA."}
{"text":"We came here for late dinner at around 830pm and ordered Beef Tendon Donburi, Shoyu Ramen, Kyouka Ramen. 

The soup for shoyu ramen was so plain and doesn't have much of the taste. Although I ordered mild spicy for Kyouka Ramen, the soup doesn't have a rich flavour into it either. And the most important ingredient which is the noodle itself wasn't chewy enough and didn't have the classic texture of ramen noodles. 

But surprisingly, their beef tendon donburi was pretty good! The beef tendon was soft enough with adequate chewiness. If you're asking me for advise, I would recommend the donburi than the ramen. 

So yea my overall experience was below average even though they have 10% off discount with checking in on yelp, I won't come for second time based on my first experience here."}
{"text":"amazing little place in the Beaches! me friend and i went here after our bike ride and reading about this place on blogTO. the place is clean and has a modern finish. it comes with free wifi but the window seat where i sat had a bad connection. my friend and i both got the kyouka ramen each ($11) and we shared the chicken wings ($6) and the slow-cooked beef tendon donburi ($5). the chicken wings were soft and tender. the flavour was on-point and had a sweet-savoury taste embedded into it. as for the donburi, it was good but I've had better. the ramen, on the other hand, is a different story! the soup was so flavourful and savoury! everything complimented each other and the portion was big! probably the best ramen in all of toronto!"}
{"text":"This place rounds out my top 3 in the GTA. Love the broth and noodles. Light to medium flavors compared to Santouka (richer) & Ju (lighter). Noodles have a great consistency, broth maybe a tad saltier than my optimal preference, but still love it."}
{"text":"Outstanding! Was in town for a meetings and stumbled upon this place. Small focused menu. It was really good. Last time I had Ramen like this was in Japan. I would be in here a few times a week if i lived in the area."}
{"text":"I have had ramen before. Never ever has it impressed me like the ramen I ate at Kyouka Ramen. I totally understand why tv chefs pursue the ultimate ramen experience. Kyouka has taken ramen to a level I never have experienced. Recommend the Kyouka Ramen (spicy)."}
{"text":"I love this place everytime I'm here! They have seasonal special ramen. This time round, I tried the Anchovy ramen. I'm always scared of something having the fishy smell... But I braved myself and thank goodness... I was not disappointed. The servers were great and I truly find an authentic Japanese spirit in this place. My friend commented that the ramen was too salty, but I guess it's very dependent on every individual's taste palate."}
{"text":"Very good ramen place in the east end.  Good little space for an intimate date or dinner out with friends. Got the Kyouka Ramen very happy with it not as heavy as pork based broth but packed with"}
{"text":"Super super salty and flavourless broth. The noodles were fine and the staff were super. The worst part hands down was the raw white onions in the ramen. Man. That was foul and disgusting. I mean wtf puts white onions in ramen. I would rather eat instant noodles than that. This is a true insult to the word ramen. Heed my warning."}
{"text":"I actually like winter, I feel justified getting fat and wearing saggy arsed sweatpants in public, who cares anymore, seriously. I'm a hermit by nature anyway, I deleted my Tinder so I can do other things with my fingers alone at night. Netflix and diddle the skittle. Don't have to shave anything anymore.

But more importantly, winter is noodle season, ramen is my new jam after years of pho. I'll still go there, don't get me wrong but that duck egg thing, split in half, resting on top, sweet Jesus, it's food porn isn't it? I once saw an Instagram post where the yolk was still really soft and someone broke it open with their chopsticks and all the yellow goo exploozed into the broth. It's a visual I've kept in storage of my mind when I want to hurry things along sometimes while the Netflix is loading the next episode of Mad Men, which I am currently rewatching because it never gets old.

Anyway I've been to a few ramen places downtown, all very good, haven't really met a bowl I didn't want to deep throat and sputter. When I read about this place in my own neighbourhood, I thought whoa, I need to try it.

I've been here a couple of times and ordered the Kyouka bowl both times, so this is how I know I can tell you for sure that this place is my favourite ramen in the entire city. First of all, the space is really friendly so you can be by yourself and not feel weird. In fact, ramen is best eaten alone in silence because you're supposed to slurp it up in under 8 minutes. I like to sit at the bar, that's where singles go. The chef is unnervingly handsome though and I'm a noisy sloppy eater, I feel a little self-conscious. Japanese culture is so refined and the people are so polite and elegant BUT! they want you to eat your noodles like a Bernese mountain dog. It's considered good manners. I am so needing to go to Japan, I feel like they would embrace me as some female Godzilla that they could tame with tentacle porn. It would work."}
{"text":"I had their Kyouka Ramen and Beef Tendon Donburi after a long day of climbing.

The first few sips of ramen was AMAZING since I was craving something fatty and Kyouka Ramen was just that. And their noodles were a thin flat noodle which I enjoyed as well. Their pork and chicken slice (1 piece each) were nice and tender. Unfortunately, I got sick of the broth pretty quickly, and I feel like there wasn't a lot of depth to it. I also didn't understand why they put leek as a topping.

And I also didn't get how half an egg is $1.

Moving on to the beef tendon bowl.
The tendon was well seasoned and very well cooked. However, the texture was a bit too clammy for my liking (this probably depends on the person a lot). And I didn't like how all the seaweed was under the beef tendon. The clammy nature of the tendon made the seaweed stick together so it was very hard to pull the 3 pieces apart, and the seaweed was soggy.

The staff was nice, and I wouldn't mind coming here again after a good day of exercising."}

Newest Ramen Place in Markham!! 

I have been wanting to try Kyouka Ramen but never made it down to Queen West. And I am definitely excited to have Kyouka come all the way uptown instead.

Chicken Broth for the non pork eater or you can do a combination of both. Vegetarian options which is soupless.

Anchovy Shoyu all sold out which is quite unique. 

Give it a try if you are up in Markham.

Kyouka Ramen ($11) I suggest go with original with less fat. The normal fat was a little too heavy for me. 

Chicken Wings ($6) was tasty and crispy.

Service is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"We had the original and the shoyu. I felt the shoyu was lacking flavour a bit. The noodles were pretty good and broth was light. Actually we mixed the broth from the shoyu and the original and it tasted amazing!

The double toppings not really worth it as you get 1 extra piece of seaweed, half egg and 2 thin slices of meat for $4. 

Will definitely be back, it's the best option for ramen in the area."}
{"text":"This is a trendy little spot. Clean and modern. Get the chicken wings it's delicious! The Shio ramen was really good but the soup base was a bit oily. The service was great and servers were attentive. Overall great dining experience!"}
{"text":"Top 5 ramen in Toronto/GTA. Amazing broth. Tender chicken and pork.  I had kyouka ramen (original fat) and chicken donburi. Superb! Seriously - there are a ton of wannabe ramen places around. This is the real deal. 

The little bit of fat in the broth makes it so rich and tasty. If you prefer no fat - no problem - as they have a few options. The chicken wings are very good with an interesting sauce and toasted sesame seeds. The pork and chicken slices in the kyouka ramen are full of flavour. They have definitely been marinated for some time. 

The chicken donburi was delicious. Tender chicken with veggies and perfectly sticky rice. 

I have eaten here at least 5 times and can say now that I am addicted to that broth. No other like it in the city. 

Only wish is that I had tried the curry ramen before they took it off the menu!"}
{"text":"First time here, place is nice and small. Noodles not too bad but little bit pricey. Over all not a bad place."}
{"text":"Tried this during lunch, the soup base abit to the salty side. The service is standard, seating area is small, shall expect wait."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. No line up, no waiting, no fuss. I had a bowl of simple vegetable ramen with clam soup base and a bowl of rice with beef tendons.  I will go back.


I had been going there since my last review. I went there about 2 weeks ago and ordered my usual ramen.  Anticipating a perfect hot ramen soup, To my surprise, I found the taste was somewhat off. I would say the soup was kind of bland.  I personally love strong flavored soup for my ramen. The ramen were shockingly not al dente ... After I got home, I checked the latest on-line reviews of this place and found out the original chef had resigned from the restaurant about a month ago. Not so sure if my recent experience had anything to do with the chef's recent departure. I will go back and hopefully the standard will go back to norm as soon as possible."}
{"text":"One word describes it all: FAT.

As described in other reviews, this restaurant's ramen has \"fat globules\" floating around in it LOL.
This restaurant is highly concentrated around the \"authentic\" ramen experience, but I've been to Japan and I'm not quite convinced.

My best friend and I ordered the Kyouka Ramen, Shoyu Ramen, Slow-Cooked Beef Tendon Donburi (bad), and Popcorn Chicken (w/ tasty sauce) to share.
Sorry, but for the ramen, the fat globules just bother me. :(

The one thing that was notably good, was their special tea selection. I enjoyed a mango green tea, and my friend had a jasmine green tea, which were both very enjoyable. Also, with the unlimited refills, I was able to enjoy 3 cups of the lovely tea n.n

Some things have changed since my last visit. I dont believe they serve the tea anymore, and for that reason, I'm not keen to return to this restaurant for any reason."}
{"text":"This was definitely a one of a kind experience that helped highlight all my tastebuds and bringing harmony from the presentation, the broth and the wonderful ramen. 

The ramen was amazing to look at and even better at taste. I would definitely recommend the 'fire' option to the ramen as the spicy chili mixture was out of this world. I could eat it with toast and avocado. I would recommend the kyouka ramen which is very good, the shoyu ramen is nice but not a fan of the soy sauce base. 

I was reading the reviews before heading over to this place and a fellow yelper recommended the beef tendon donburi! This was a wonderful note to end on. The beef tendon was soft and felt heavenly in my mouth! What a great suggestion! 

Parking should not be a problem, there are a lot of side streets to park on. I would definitely go back and become a regular!"}
{"text":"I don't quite get the whole \"ramen thing\", but this is the best I've had - and the only bowl I'd go back for. (My other ramen experiences have left me wishing I'd gone for pho instead.) I had the spicy regular Kyouka ramen, just the standard $11 bowl was more than filling enough.

Try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great and friendly service. They don't have a lot of ramen options but it's a solid choice in the beaches area."}
{"text":"Better than Sansotei in my opinion. Their Kyouka ramen and Shoyu ramen are my favourites. Broth is tasty and noodles are cooked perfectly.

The restaurant can get chilly in the winter when people walk in and out! Sit far away from the entrance."}
{"text":"One of the worse situation is being hungry with no idea what you want and driving in circles.  That's what happened to me in Markham after going to the CAA on Woodbine.  Lucky for us, we spotted the Kyouka Ramen spot.  We thought it would be the perfect place to grab lunch.

From what I read, it seems that Kyouka has another location in Queen West (thanks Jen K.).  I am glad they opened up in the GTA.  The location is a stand-alone building that was a burger joint in the past - I think it was called the Prime, which I've been to...once only.  Out with the bricks and in with the black paint job all over the restaurant.  With so much black and monochromatics, It looked like a place created for a Sapporo Legendary Biru commercial - which is the beer that they feature...hmmmm...coincidence?

On my first trip there, I wasn't sure what to order but when a place puts their name on a dish, it's a good chance that they want you to try it.  The order for that afternoon was their Kyouka Ramen - spicy with less fat and their chicken wings.  Just so you know, the ramen can be prepared with normal, less, and no fat broth, flavoured mild, spicy or fire (for a small fee).

The ramen was very good.  The portion was decent sized for $11 and the richness of the less fat option was more than enough for me.  I would probably not enjoy the original option.  I did make a mental note to try their no fat version (which I did on the second time around and it was really good!).  The meats were edible and not dried out like other places and it had ample toppings to make it a meal.  Some may find the broth salty and I have to admit, that it does border on it but I prefer some salt over bland.

The wings were crispy and delicious and a small meal in itself.  It is not going to win any best wings competition, however, it was a treat to have that afternoon.

The Shoyu and Shio Ramens do not come with flavour options.  Can't speak to the Shoyu one, however, the Shio (which I tried recently) was a bit on the salty side.  The broth was clear and briny with good portions of noodle and a nice small meal was had with a smile.

All in all, this place has won my go to place for Ramen so far.  The check-in 10% is also a nice surprise for all Yelpers.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ramen was authentic and very flavourful. Wings were a perfect complement, and the size is great for sharing (3 full wings), and seasoned exceptionally well. Fair prices, attentive service, but small and busy. Get there early to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"I had the original kyouka Ramen and the chicken Donburi. The Donduri was very good, tasty and spicy. I was really surprised by the broth which was too fatty for me. I had a lot of ramen in Shanghai, Japan and never had a broth that fatty, maybe i'm not familiar with this type of ramen broth. Next time I'll try no fat at all. The noodle was a bit too soft and mushy compared to what I'm used to, I like them medium and chewy. The meat was ok, nothing incredible tho. Service was good, the staff seems to care about there customers and was nice."}
