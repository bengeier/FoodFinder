{"text":"Very clean. Well presented. The food is mainly Italian and they do have a wide selection. They do take out orders. They have a dedicated deserts and coffee counter. The coffee is luxury.  Overall it is good value for money with good service. I would recommend the veal dish."}
{"text":"The staff are very nice and they make you feel very welcome! Came in for lunch was quite tastey but found the tomato sauce to be quite watery and thin. Deserts where Lovley even tried a chefs special desert he made him self :)"}
{"text":"Nice little cafe...  I've had veal sandwiches here before that were quite good.  Today, I tried the pulled pork sandwich - it looked better than it tasted.  It tasted like ham in a lot of watery sauce, a bit salty for my liking.  Decent place to visit, I'd pass on the pulled pork."}

{"text":"I have been here a few times now. Good Italian fair. My favourite so far would be the veal sandwich. The servers are very friendly and the place is clean. Only downside is the prices are high. They also charge extra for each topping on the veal ie peppers, mushrooms."}
{"text":"They were nice to open up after hours to serve me a sandwich and a slice of pizza. I couldn't have been happier becuse I was starving.

Inside the dining area is clean and enjoyable to sit in.

The food was good for lunch and the options were good enough. Thanks again for opening to serve me when I was passing out due to hunger."}
