{"text":"great service, relaxing environment and the food is good mind you I ate only a crepe with chocolate and strawberries ;-p"}
{"text":"Great place with great friendly staff. Owners are always present and are very customer oriented. The food is amazing. The shisha is the best in town. The atmosphere is second to none. I would most definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to chill and have a great time. This is by far the best middle eastern restaurant in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"Sisha and tea.. Is all you need to spend a perfect evening with friends. Located in Core downtown, a big hall for about 100 people capacity.  They offer regular flavours as well as nicotine free flavours of shisha. They have tea pots in small medium and large sizes.   2015 new years eve, we and bunch of friends reached there around 2:00AM, tired and missing something in the parties we attended. But this place rocked, they played some Arabic music (I didn't understand the words, but the loved the music) the people started dancing and suddenly celebrations was in the air, it was lovely, amazing!  People we dancing and feeling the music, soon we and everyone else joined the party. It was a memorable new year. We stayed there till 5:00 PM."}
