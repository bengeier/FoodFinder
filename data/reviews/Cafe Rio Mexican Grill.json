{"text":"This place is awesome!! The food is super yummy and the service is amazing!!! The girl who helped us said that they have only been open for 5 days. I am so impressed!!! They really have it together!!!
EAT HERE IT'S WONDERFUL!!!!"}
{"text":"I've always loved this place. You have to try the shredded beef salad. It's the best thing on the menu by far! And the house dressing is delicious. Kids get a free cheese quesadilla when you order an adult entree which is great. This specific location has never had super friendly employees... I just remember the Gilbert location being so nice and this one is lacking in that department."}
{"text":"We went for taco Tuesday.  Service is hurried and food is slung together.   Staff do not take time to drain juice from meat or water from lettuce.  You end up with a soggy tortilla. Fresh made tortilla would be good if not treated like a sponge. Meat is tasty.  Cleanliness is questionable because they are so busy. Could be a great place if someone was managing the restaurant who cared enough about their product."}
{"text":"I have been to this location multiple times and can say that consistently: the food is good, the service is terrible. The employees always seem put out that they have to do their jobs. The trash cans are always overflowing. An employee seemed put out that they had to stop texting at the register to ring us up. The manager seriously needs to fix their staff issue or no one will come back for the food."}
{"text":"Glad to have one close to home. I have been to two other locations also the San tan location and the mesa location and have had way better customer service experiences. I've been to this location twice and both times there has been many dirty tables left even though they weren't so busy. The high chairs weren't too clean so it was difficult to find one for my daughter.  Like the food, but they need to work on a few details!"}
{"text":"Sunday at 11:50am (they opened at 11 restaurant was not busy), husband & son ordered steak salads  & I ordered grilled chicken, the young man working the line said they did not have either one cooked yet & it would be 45 minutes to grill the chicken & no steak available, he could care less. With so many other restaurants to choose from we left. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"First time there and I got the sweet pork salad with their tomatillo ranch! It was amazing! Sweet and spicy all in one dish! The fresh tortilla topped the whole thing off! Very generous portions, I was not able to finish the salad! I will definitely be going back to try more things on the menu, or to get the sweet pork again!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is fantastic. The one star review is based solely on the terrible coustomer service at this location. It seems like there's no manager on duty. The lady running the register was sitting down talking to other employees. After a few minutes of just standing there I said excuse me can I pay for my meal? The girl seemed very irritated that she had to come help me. I almost walked out and left the food. I will not be going back here."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love the food here! However, I came at 2:30 in the afternoon, the restaurant was practically empty, yet it took over 10 minutes to order and pay for my food. I go to find a table and literally, every table needed to be cleaned! I get my drink and utensils, and there are no forks stocked. Then after I was done with my meal, the garbage cans were overflowing and I couldn't throw my trash away! The cleanliness and customer service and terrible."}
{"text":"Incostency is the key here... 
They're often unprepared, and depending on who makes your food you get it in very different variations. Also prices have gone up twice already in 2016 and the new app actually works  against you for earning free food per dollar vs the old stamp cards"}
{"text":"The fresh tortillas, the sweet sweet pork Barbacoa and the mild tomatillo sauce are absolutely delightful. All wrapped up enchilada style? Perfection.
Rice and pinto beans are very flavorful and complete a wonderful dish.

No fan of the disposable aluminum plates though :/"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past. It was decent food, quick and easy for a school night. However, the last time I went here will be the last the last time I ever go again! I took an order of the chips and salsa to go. About half of the container of salsa gone. I notice a broken rubber band floating in it. Absolutely disgusting! Nope! Nah uh never again. Don't eat here people."}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying I love cafe rio but today was the worst experience I've had from any restaurant ever. The cashiers name is Jennifer. To start I ordered my food and everything went well. I paid for my 2 burritos 2 salads and 5 drinks. Then the cashier gave me my 5 cups and I told her I wanted large not the regular size. She had already rung me up so she got irritated because I said that. She said she couldn't charge me for the difference so I would have to get a refund and wait for my refund for two days on my card. I said that's fine. Then after she rung me up I got my receipt for the large cups but not for the refund. I asked for a copy of the refund receipt for my business card and she said she couldn't do it. I said I needed proof in case I didn't get my refund and she got mad and in Spanish told someone else \"atiendela tu\" with a annoyed voice like saying you deal with her. The other girl comes and gives me a receipt. I asked the girl that was clearly so annoyed her name and she said Jennifer and rolled her eyes. Then when I was filling up my drinks she proceeds to tell the other girl I'm Spanish \"estaba enojada la estupida\" - translation that b**ch was mad. And started saying other things but I already forgot because I got so angry. I said \"you need to stop being so rude\" then she walked all the way from the register and confronted me and said laughing \"what what am I said\" I said \"I know Spanish and you need to stop being so rude\". She got closer and said \"I'm not doing anything to you plus she's my manager\", laughed and walked away. I left and a customer followed me and told me to yelp it and contact corporate. I'm so irritated with how unprofessional and rude she was."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill fast.  Portions have gotten skimpier each time.  I have had the staff remove steak and chicken from my food more than once.  Today when I asked them not to take the chicken off my taco was told they would charge extra.  Many of the employees look miserable and barely smile.  Used to go here a lot but will think long and hard about other options next time."}
{"text":"Great food! nice place, staff if very friendly! They got my vote!"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my visit here tonight. When I got there I was the only person in line and thought it would be a quick process. I put in half of my order (which wasn't what I came for because they had no steak) and the lady working the cash register yelled at the girl helping me to go take her break. Then I waited for FIFTEEN minutes for someone else to finish my order. By that point the kids quesadillas and my husbands tacos were burnt. It only got worse after that. 

When the next person came to finish my order he was irritated that the other girl only started half. The girl that finished my salad rolled eyes when I requested shredded lettuce. After my order was mostly put together I proceeded to the cash register. The lady working walked away and told me she couldn't ring me up because she had to go make whipped cream... The girl that helped with my salad could tell I was irritated and came over to ring me up, but not before taking time to swap phone numbers with a co-worker. 

When I got home half of my food was cold and burnt.  I usually love Cafe Rio but I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"Food is amazing!  The service however, some of the worst I have seen in the industry.  Very poorly managed.  Staff is lackadaisical at best when it comes to even remotely attempting to care about their jobs.  Girl behind the counter was talking about calling in the next day since she was going to be hung over, cashier double charged my card by ringing up the same item twice and had an attitude about fixing it, overheard complaints about being busy and wanting to lock the door so no one else could come in, and to top it off, they were out of Cholula hot sauce on the self serve bar and I asked for more and was told there was none even though I saw it in the back cooking area and when I pointed that out, she rolled her eyes at me.  If the food was not as good as it is, I would never go here."}
{"text":"We love Cafe Rio!  Its one of our favorite places to eat!  They are busy but they seem to move thru the line pretty quickly.  Yay for Taco Tuesday!!"}
{"text":"Love, love , love this place. Homemade tortillas, fresh everything! Yummy! Also you need to try Cafe Rios mint lemonade. Enjoy:)"}
{"text":"I enjoy the freshness of the tortillas and vegetables. Had the fire grilled steak salad and loved every bite. Will definitely eat here often"}
{"text":"Use to love Cafe Rio when we lived in Idaho, went all the time! I was pretty excited that they were coming to Goodyear. First visit was barely ok, prices are higher, very slow no hard tortillas for tostada had to wait, breaking down line at 8:30pm and not great guest service at all. The second time was again like the first but something seemed very salty (beans or chicken?) to the point I couldn't finish it. The vanilla coke looked light so I waited for the cashier who had disappeared, so I waited till she returned and she was like oh yeah we're out, so you'll have to pick something else. Ok?
I use to love Cafe Rio as it was something I could grab that was priced well, fresh and everyone liked at home. What happened to the old Cafe Rio I remembered ?"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for lunch after a recommendation from a friend. Once I took a few minutes to review the menu options and choices, the process went fairly smooth. The homemade tortillas were fantastic and all of the food tasted great. It definitely will take a few visits to the hang of the place and try out more of the items and see what we like best but the tacos and burrito were great and the kids loved the quesadillas."}
{"text":"If i could give a 0 i would the first time i went i got a steak burrito i got home and when i say salty i mean inedible so i said maybe it was just a bad day so i went today and tried a different meat shredded pork nachos when i got home i started to eat them annd when i say sweet i mean i have had candy that wasn't that sweet i don't like complaining but if you like super sweet or super salty then this is the place for you i was so disappointed the manager should really try the food before its served because the ambiance is nice the textures of the food are okay i just really think that the cooks are being careless and they know they messing up but they still serve it because they dont want to get in trouble.after my first experience i called the store to tell them and i spoke with Gino he was very polite and told me next Time my food would be on him well when i went today and said his name they looked at me like i was crazy come to find out Gino works at another location well i wished he worked at the onr in chandler because he could teach them a thing or two about being polite"}
{"text":"Concur with other reviews...rude and rushed service. Have been there several times and they always screw up my order. $8.00 for a cheese quesadilla!!!!!! Please support other worthy Mexican restaurants and not this place!!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio's food, but unfortunately the service at this particular location is terrible. I called in an order for pickup and was told it would be 45 minutes. I thought that seemed a bit long for a pickup order, but no big deal as I had a couple errands to run anyway. When I showed up 45 minutes later to pickup my order I was told that they don't have an order under my name. I was then told I could place my order and wait another 45 minutes!! Needless to say I will never be placing a pickup order from this Cafe Rio again!"}
{"text":"We went in last night - take out food

Very similar to Chipotle with some better seats, colorful tables and a decent patio overlooking the parking lot. I did not see any dogs on the patio so I am not sure of that status.

you stand in line to order your food and it is prepared in front of you as you move down the assembly line - does this sound familiar?

I immediately noticed the employees were very negative and several customers in front of us were openly rolling their eyes at the lack of caring

We ordered a simply order of 2 chicken tacos and a steak burrito.

the tacos are prepared on a flat top behind the line - our order was clearly lost or forgotten but at the end of the process they quickly made new tacos.. how hard is it to make 2 tacos?

the thing that will turn me off forever of CAFE RIO was the cross-contamination of food in the assembly process - chicken openly floating in the beans, the same spoon was used for Steak, then dipped into the salsa and then into the pork (I assume it was pork)

then it happened... the young man preparing the tacos, turned around with a wet rag and gloved hands.. now he cared enough to clear, but as he wiped the prep area down the towel he was using was dripping into the chicken broth and then into several of the beans etc... that part alone was gross, but then he turns back to his taco flat top; did not change gloves or wash his hands, grabbed someone's tacos for prep - talk about germs spread everywhere.

The burrito was much bigger than chipotle - big enough for 2 to eat.

I will not return due to the gross factor of Café RIO -"}
{"text":"Similar to Costa Vida. The new location has brought the crowd so avoid lunch time and dinner if you don't want to wait. The food is salty as others have commented, but I think that is what you get. I have eaten at a couple of their other locations and experienced the same salty dishes."}
{"text":"Such great food when everything is right, I just wish they could work on consistency at this location. If you stand in line and order at the restaurant, you are likely to get a great meal since everything is done right in front of you. However you will also be in queue for 20-30 minutes + during the lunch rush. I've taken to ordering ahead, but nearly every time my online order experience has been poor. Once, the tortillas were barely cooked and gummy, like they had a bad batch and decided to pawn them off on to-go orders. Once the order was 15 minutes late, once I got the wrong meal entirely etc etc. I would give the food four stars when it's on point, but the service gets one or two stars at best for consistency problems."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio and wish I could give this location a good review.... But we have been let down too many times. FOUR TIMES we have come around 5-5:30 (the dinner hour, right??) and they have been out of steak. The first time- aww man bad luck. Second time- wait, what?? Third time- ok what is happening? Why is there never steak? Fourth time- NEVER AGAIN. All four times we have turned around and left because that's all my husband will eat there! The good thing is that their loss is MOD pizza and Smashburger's gain (both right by it)! Can't wait for a Rio in Queen Creek!"}
{"text":"Went back to try the pork.  That was 5 stars. 

Workers this time definitely dropped the stars. If you don't want to be there,  maybe don't work there? Unless the attitude comes free with the food,  I didn't order it. There wasn't even a line, so not sure why the girls were all so crabby. 

Smiles and courtesy must have been extra cause I got none of that.  The lemonade I wanted was out,  so I took another.  The mango hot sauce I wanted was empty. Honestly,  those are 2 of the main reasons I like the place.  My favorite was the bagged to go order was put in a wrinkly used bag. I'm all over recycling,  but really?"}
{"text":"I discovered Cafe Rio on a trip to Utah. So I was excited to find out that Cafe Rio had branched out to Arizona. To my surprise, the food and ingredient quality has not changed from that of Utah locations. I recommend Cafe Rio if you come across one. However, this location's customer service leaves a lot be desired.  The food is great though!"}
{"text":"Glad to have this amazing restaurant in our neighborhood! Went for the first time last night...friendly, fast service & food was awesome. We are hooked!"}
{"text":"We tried chicken & carne burritos & a salad. Really good flavors across the board. Food itself is fine, no complaints there. Major problem is their service & line setup - it wasn't all that busy the day we tried it and yet they rushed us through the line like there was a fire. I get the fast casual concept, but that was ridiculous! There's no point in pushing people through choices when there was a bottleneck at the cashier and we didn't get our food any sooner had they taken a second to clearly explain options or give us a chance to even see what all toppings are available (they didn't design the queue well and you don't see your options until you're right on top of them). Staff didn't communicate well & just about made the wrong burrito before my family noticed and spoke up. Also they just assumed everyone wanted rice & didn't ask. Price is high too for what you're getting. Chipotle & Costa Vida are superior. Likely won't go back but flavor of the food is the only reason they rank higher than 1 star."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!! i would defiantly recommend...make sure you come with an appetite ...the servings are very generous"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying - I LOVE CAFE RIO. But not this location. This location is unlike any other. I've been quite a few times as it's right up the street from my house and every time I've gone their customer service has been absolutely HORRENDOUS.

For some reason they can't seem to listen when you're ordering even when you practically scream your order over the little glass thing so be prepared to repeat your order ten times and then get a few eye rolls from the employees preparing your food like you've ruined their day by existing.

Also don't be surprised if the manager/owner lady walks away from the register right when you're about to pay to go talk to someone and you're left standing there while multiple employees right next to the register completely avoid any kind of contact with you. And then of course when said manager/owner lady returns to the register after you're forced to wave your hand in her face, gives you major attitude like you (the CUSTOMER) haven't just been completely ignored for an ungodly amount of time. 

Please don't go to this location. I'm convinced by now that they will do everything they can to make it a painful experience."}
{"text":"Stopped in as it was new in the area.

this is somewhere between fast food and a real mexican joint.

it is best summed up as, 'fast, casual and bland'

no return factor, no reason to talk about this place.. blah food and my burrito meal was close to $17.. for what? bland & casual

there are better places to spend my money - will not return"}
{"text":"The shredded beef was salty and the rice had a lump of salt. Worst food I've had. Won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"First of all, their tortillas are life.

When I went I ordered chicken tacos, with rice and beans on the side, of course. Let's just say I was silent the entire time because that was how much I enjoyed my food. As I said the tortillas were amazing and the meat was perfectly juicy.

The feel of the overall restaurant was great. They played good music, it was clean and had a positive atmosphere from all the bright colors everywhere."}
{"text":"If you like SALTY!!!!! Mexican food... This is your restaurant.  

I had a chicken burrito yesterday and no matter how much water I drank after my meal, I couldn't quench my thirst from all the sodium in the food. Come'on people in order to be fresh you need to remove the high sodium preservatives. It will cost you more, but your guests these days are much more educated when it comes to high sodium food.  I wouldn't go back!"}
{"text":"SALTY, SALTY, SALTY!!!!!!!!! Unbearable... I had to Toss my food and then drink a gallon of water to wash out the salt in my mouth. I feel like I was in the ocean and I swallowed salt water. The reason they get 2 stars is the guy on the line was nice."}
{"text":"Great place to eat! The salmon tacos are bomb....another plus is that they close at 11."}
{"text":"Last night I went to cafe rio and had the worst experience of customer service. I come in and I explained to the lady my order might be complicated I would like my chips in a separate box then all my topping because by the time I get home my chips are soggy. I live about an hour away from the nearest cafe rio. Well I guess she couldn't understand what I was saying so she got an attitude just started throwing any kind of topping she wanted in there because she didn't give me the ones I asked for. At the end she threw my food at me and told the cashier \"to just put my shit in a bag\". When I say she threw my food at me I mean threw it at me my food slid onto the counter tipped over and everything, it just went everywhere. I was outraged, first I drove 1 hour to get to the establishment to pay almost $20 for a meal that was thrown at me and half of it to be spilled on the counter and floor. I asked to speak to a manager and she did nothing made me pay for the food and I left. later when I called and asked to speak to corporate then she wanted to be like I'll give you a coupon to come back and see us. No thank you I want to speak to corporate. Terrible customer service, absolute worst. Will never see another dime of my money."}
{"text":"Love the tortillas, freshly made in front of you & they are awesome. That being said, the staff is often rude or not interested. Several times my order has been screwed up. Then there are the patrons. I've honestly never been to a restaurant with such a collection of rude people. Honestly, people nudge you out of the way without saying excuse me. Others look at you like you don't belong (probably because I'm not dressed for church). Didn't realize they had a virtual dress code. I will continue to come back, but I will only come with the place is less crowded. Every time I've come & it's busy, it never goes well."}
{"text":"I've been to other cafe rios and loved them but was definitely disappointed about this particular locations product. It was clean and service was good it was just the food was lower then standards."}
{"text":"The place was dirty, staffed with unenthusiastic and frown-faced teens, and the shredded beef tasted like salt.  It was the worst dining experience I've ever had in Chandler."}
{"text":"I have heard several people talking about this place the last few weeks, so I thought I would give it a go.
I love that the Camelback corridor is blooming with new restaurants, but no need to go back to this one.

PRO's:
The restaurant, cafeteria style, is extremely clean! Awesome!
The menu, several options to the core styles of Mexican dishes (ie: burros, tacos, etc)
Around $8 for a generous meal for one...not bad!

CON's:
Service is slow.  Going through the line of 'fixings' takes a while.
If you want lettuce in your burro, prepared to have it on the side.  They make your burrito with choice of meat, cheese, beans, then 'nuke' it in a conveyer belt toaster oven. (really)?
I asked for lettuce in my burrito, and they said they put it on the side as to not send it through heater.
Tortillas made there...but nothing to write home about

It's not a terrible place to go...just nothing worth having a frequent visitor punch card there.
I would suggest Panchero's (exact SAME concept) over Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Unbelievably delicious food. Everything is super fresh and everyone is super friendly. The best dish in my opinion is the sweet pork salad. You will not be disappointed by this place! The house made tomatillo ranch is insane! They also have tons of drinks, even horchata! With unlimited refills? Does it get any better?"}
{"text":"I love it here! The meats are much better than chipotle. I'm so glad they opened one up north.  I've been going to the one in Gilbert for a while."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Rio! I stopped in one afternoon, and experienced the absolutely BEST tacos I've had in the Valley. Homemade tortillas that can't be beat. If you're looking for a fresher alternative to the burrito chains, then look no further!"}
{"text":"This is a great go to place for busy nights or take out! The price is great for the portions and I don't understand why the reviews don't reflect that - personally, I think some people are too particular about some things and like it a very specific way.  The tortillas are DELICIOUS!  If anything just come here for the tortillas!! The guacamole is so good, and I know that some other reviews call it \"okay\".... what do you want? a mind blowing guacamole? it's a great guacamole that uses fresh ingredients and has great flavor... What more is there? The salsas are great, too!  I like how the spicy ones are actually spicy and aren't mild.  Great place, great food, great prices!"}
{"text":"Not fresh.... It's fast and easy which is nice but it's basically a worse version of Chipotle. I had a burrito and it was average."}
{"text":"I ate here because a co-worker had recommended it. I ordered it online and had my co-worker go pick it up for me. I got the chicken salad and asked for the lime cilantro dressing and extra pico. When I opened it up, it had no dressing and no pico... It literally was a bowl of lettuce, chicken, rice and beans. No flavor and really dry. I doubt I will ever go here again. I would rather spend $10 on a bowl at Chipotle. I will say that the chicken had some nice flavor, but not enough to make up for no salad dressing or pico. I didn't go in, so I can't attest to the customer service."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because my friends do, but it just didn't happen. I ordered a single chicken taco although it was cool watching the process, the end result was a soggy folded burrito. Was quickly asked if I wanted beans or rice and I asked for rice, and got a half scoop of overly tangy lime and chunky cilantro rice for a three dollar up sell. Although it tasted ok it was disgusting to eat."}
{"text":"I love Café Rio's food! This location does not disappoint so far as the food goes.  We like this location a lot better than the other Gilbert location. I would have easily given them five stars if it weren't for one of the employees we had to deal with.  Before our order, she appeared to be struggling to put together somebody else's order. When one of her coworkers tried to assist her, she got defensive and was rude to him.  She wasn't very pleasant to us as customers either. Bad day perhaps?"}
{"text":"Horrible service. The food deserves four or five stars but the service has gotten progressively worse over the last few months. The food is always good and tasty. I don't like giving negative reviews- especially for service- because I understand servers can be over worked and they are allowed to have a bad day. But, the last three or four months the service is just not great. Staff make you feel like you are interrupting their conversations and customers can hear employees complaining about each other. I may go to the other locations for awhile until they work out the bugs with customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible!!!!! The rice was so hard the beans were so salty. The service of the staff was horrible. All in all stay away."}
{"text":"Rio has some great food but sometimes late at night they are out of some choices. Still it's a great place to eat. 

Only complaint is I have been coming here for about 2 years now and the staff allows a transient to occupy a seat every time I am hear. 

Normally this wouldn't be an problem but the guys shaves in the restroom, is touching all the utensils, and  wiping counters like he works here. 

5 star place knocked down to 4 stars for the transient."}
{"text":"Honestly I only get one thing here every time I come in and that is the sweet barbacoa pork burrito enchilada style. It has the freshest ingredients in just taste so damn good! Today I went for broke and ordered extra meat as well! I can now die a happy man. My wife loves their horchata and a couple other unique drink offerings."}
{"text":"Went in tonight around 7-7:30.. whoever is making the food (next to tortillas) was one of the worst employees I've ever seen. I've worked in the food industry for awhile, and she was a prime example of what not to do when serving customers. She had no expression (just a mad look on her face) and snapped questions at customers like they were an inconvenience. There were multiple unfinished salads and tacos on the grill, and instead of helping out the other girl on line (the taller one, she was great), the main girl just walked around or even just stood there while the other girl had over 6 salads to make. She wouldn't help her make the salads or take anything off the grill. 

I'll be back because I love the food and the normal service, but the girl doing lead tonight was terrible."}
{"text":"This place is pricey for what you get. Wouldn't recommend the pork - it is too sweet and taste like it should be on a slider and not in my Mexican food. Service wasn't very friendly.  However, nice atmosphere and drink selection."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food (including fresh tortillas), they are trying real hard, but their process is jacked up. This process issue creates two main problems for the customer: as your order moves down the line, each separate employee has no idea what you told the last person, so you have to constantly repeat yourself, and then to add to the confusion, once during the process your order disappears to be baked and you as the customer have to be watching to \"claim\" your order to continue the process. This process issue also creates their second main problem which is their long, slow line."}
{"text":"Its good, not great.  Again, is just a Chipotle with more options so if you like Chipotle you will like this place. The way food is served is just like in Chipotle (buffet style) most importantly they also compare in flavor.  Which, in my opinion, is just OK."}
{"text":"I have to say, this was totally solid. Is it as good as some of the Mexican food you can get here in Arizona? No, but that would be ridiculous to expect from a chain. I shared the enchiladas with my mom and they were really tasty, as were the rice and beans on the side.
I came back a few days later just to get some queso dip to go (I'd been craving it, okay?), and while it was pretty good, I wouldn't call it life changing.
If you go, definitely get either the mint lemonade or the horchata-- both are great!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting at this location as I type and the food is great but the employees in the back are blasting Hard Rock and rap music as they're working and it's very annoying because they have the radio for the whole restaurant to hear and their personal iPod going on at the same time...."}
{"text":"Hands down the best taco I've ever had for the price! Tortilla soup was simply awesome! I saw a guy getting a Mexican chicken salad  and  it was HUGE ...enough for an army! Looks like taco Tuesday special for a 1.95 great deal! Yum"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service!!! Every time my family goes in, there's a new story of how rude their employees are. The most recent one: I called in for a take-out order and was told it would be 30 minutes for 1 burrito, I politely asked if there was anyway if it could be made sooner and the response I got was \" well...... there is no one in line right now so you can just come in and order it yourself.\" SERIOUSLY!!!??? Your are going to tell me it's going to 30 minutes for 1 burrito when there is \"NO ONE\" in line and then tell me to come in and order it when I am ALREADY on the phone with you??? Safe to say Café Rio lost a customer and Costa Vida gained one."}
{"text":"No thanks... Next time I go to chipotle get a better meal for less money. They seem to nickel and dime you every little thing...they wanted almost $20 for one burrito and a quesadilla with only cheese... That's without any drinks I will not be back."}
{"text":"I don't really see why I should choose this place over Del Taco or Taco Bell to be honest (let alone Chipotle or Fillie's). The staff would be the same (maybe better) and I'd get more food for almost the same quality. Watch out with their Taco Tuesday special. $1.75 for a small soft taco. If you get the \"tacos\", don't take the beans and rice or drink when they offer it or the special no longer applies and it jumps up to $6-$8 they don't let you know till you get to the register where they offer you a drink for a few dollars more like what happened with me. Leaves a bad taste in the mouth. But I went back anyway, not to be fooled again only to find out you can only get a limited amount of ingredients in the tacos for the special to apply. I don't think I could even get cheese on it. So I said whatever, paid my money and sat down to eat my limited tacos w/ no drink and suddenly the dining area seemed a little darker, the music a little louder and more irritating, and other diners with the same butt hurt looks on their face I probably had, and probably thinking, \"Why in the world did I come here?\" too.

Café Rio gets one star in my book for having a misleading/unclear menu, unhelpful and unfriendly employees, nickel and diming approach guised as specials, overcharging for small portions of food with limited ingredients, and charging extra for things that come standard every where else. Literally, the only positive I can say for this place is that some of the ingredients are fresh, but in the face of all those other factors and my experiences there it doesn't really matter and I won't be back. If I'm going to have Mexican food I'll just go to one of the other 6 or so Mexican places that come readily to mind, not to mention the other local, less marketed restaurants that I use yelp to find that that eclipse this place with their better service, food, prices, and atmosphere. For all those reasons, going here is just unthinkable to me."}
{"text":"My family loves Cafe Rio. I have been to a dozen locations between AZ and UT many many times through many years. I can say without question this is by far the WORST location I have been to. 

I have eaten at this location many time, picked up to go and the company I work for has been catered several times. I keep coming back because my family doesn't give me much option as it is convenient. 

When dining in at this location you will notice that the place is filthy, from the chairs and tables to the floor and bathrooms, even the outside seating is bad. I always get concerned when an establishment that sells food lacks policies to maintain cleanliness, does this extend to personal hygiene? 

The staff are fine, no big issues here, seems like it is just run poorly overall - maybe managers are the issue? 

Most recently, today, we had a large order of food catered to the office. So many issues here. When you cater through Cafe Rio, it is done in a good way, you basically put together a purchase order for what you want. It seems like there would be little room for error here. Somehow this method is not working. Without fail, this location is late. Food is never ready on time. Ever. Additionally, despite the reminding them of issues in the past, they STILL forgot several items ordered. Today several of the dishes seemed cold (cheese in enchiladas were not melted, cold) and carelessly made (wraps seemed like they were made many hours earlier, not fresh) as well. Overall very disappointing. The past times we catered for the office, it was always the same issue. Repeatedly forgetting items and ALWAYS late. Additionally no effort is made to make restitution for the many errors. 

This food has so much potential. This could be a great location. But, presently, it is not. I would not expect our office will be ordering here any longer, and I hope my family will not force me to go on location either.

The queso is good though. But I assume that's hard to mess up."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money. They don't want your money either by the way they act. Most times they are out of basic items a Mexican grill should have like guacamole, avocado, lettuce, pico, or sour cream at least that's what was included in meal that I did not get. Young kids don't care your paying 20 bucks for 10 worth of food they don't even make correctly. Ask for a tortilla on the side, nah you can't have that. Don't go here, literally anywhere else you will have a better time."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  I got an email for $5 off as part of their club I had signed up for from a previous visit.  In the email it did not mention I would need to download an app and when I presented the email at check out I was told I needed to download the app, otherwise there is nothing they can do.  After sitting there and downloading the app it wanted me to change my password, but did not like any I put or their own suggested password.  Next time if you are going to take your family for Mexican, go to Abuelos.  There was no help from staff or attempt, just staring at you in an already tense moment at checkout."}
{"text":"Food usually tastes better when you receive it with a smile on the persons face who's handing it to you.. Customer service is terrible and they try to charge you for every little thing. They don't serve corn cause it's one more free thing they'd have to include in their price."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is my favorite restaurant and I frequent this location a lot because it's so close to my house. I have been consistently going a few times a week for about a year and I want to like this location, but they have a high turnover of employees, which means they aren't happy. Most of the time, it seems as if it's a burden to serve the customer, give small portions and are frowning. There are occasional times though, when you do get someone who provides good customer service and reasonable to great portions, which is great to experience, but it shouldn't be an occasional instance, but a normal occurrence. Most of the time the food is delicious and good quality, however these last few months it seems as if they have been changing their recipe for the beans and house dressing. I can only give 3 stars for the inconsistency, especially since I frequent so much and this last time I was in there the service was horrible and it was 11:00 am and no one was in line, but me. I waited for a few minutes before someone acknowledged me and when she made my food, she slapped it together, she barely put any meat in it and my burrito was half the size it normally should be. I wish I took a picture of it, so you could see the size difference, but I wasn't happy I paid $10 for half a burrito. It's the little things that they keep doing at this location to show they don't really care about the customers that adds up and is making me scale back the number of times I eat there each week. I hope they get new management in there that provides good leadership and hires good people that are happier to be there."}
{"text":"I first came to love cafe rio while going to school in Utah. Apparently the standards drop the farther you get from home base. This place seemed dirty and the line took forever. I'm accustomed to long lines at cafe rios, but they usually move quick. The two times we've gone the line has taken at least 30 mins. The crew seems slow and careless. Very poorly run. I don't care how good food may be, it's not worth the wait and mess. Not planning to go back to this one sadly, just not worth the terrible service."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is amazing! Everything to the fresh hand made tortillas, the queso dip, house sauce and the sweet pork are to die for! A must try and you'll fall in love!"}
{"text":"I Ordered a Steak burrito Enchilada style . Enchilada style they simply add  red sauce and cheese and put it thru their  oven . Excellent burrito the steak is grilled and its high quality . 

The pinto beans are tasty which they are homemade I also had them add some spicy red sauce to the burrito added a good flavor , but did not seem spicy . 

The tortillas are homemade which I can appreciate very good . All their sauces are homemade the red sauce is very good , I know the sauce is made from a blend of 3 different chills they use .ancho, Guajillo and california .

I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys fresh and tasty Mexican food . Nothing comes from a can out of this place .the place was clean and the staff very friendly ."}
{"text":"The food is sooo goood!!! The best part though is that they are consistent. Every time I go their food is always as amazing as it was the time prior. Nice people and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is great you must try the sweet pork it is great I went here the last two days in a row and loved it Tuesday was taco Tuesday and tacos are only 2 dollars and wed I got the tostada with pork it can with a drink for free"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect but it was recommended from a coworker so I tried it out. The setup is similar to Chipotle, however the atmosphere is more authentic southwestern style.   More than just burritos and bowls. The food is better tasting. I will definitely come back again and again! Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Overpriced bad mexican food. On top of that the staff had a bad attitude. Don't waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"YUM!

Went here with some sorority sisters after an afternoon of volunteering. I am fairly certain it's a newer place and just had its grand opening a few weeks ago. I ordered a salad with came in the soft tortilla shell. I got the chicken, lettuce, gacumole, pico, tomato, cheese, and a wonderful creamy chiptole dressing.
I devoured it. It was so delish. The best part about ordering at the place to is that they will sing to you if you order nachos. I couldn't make out what they were saying 100% but it was entertaining. They also have a really festive array of drinks. Your typical soda machine of course, but off to the side is about 4 cooler of fun mixes. There's mint lemonade, Mexican limeade, and 2 others. All made in house and totally authentic. 

They are making their claim to fame with the torillas though. I would recommend this place to just go and eat their bread all day."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! My first time there and I am super impressed with how good it was. Might even pick this over chipotle."}
{"text":"If owning a restaurant was just about the food, this place would get 4 or 5 stars. However, there are two problems with this particular restaurant. First, it's pricey compared to similar Mexican restaurant counterparts (Chipotle, Pacheros, etc.).

Most importantly was our experience there on several nights (weekdays and weekends). My family is vegetarian, and we usually ask employees to simply change out their gloves when they're making our food (a normal request). We know that a lot of places aren't 100% vegetarian friendly, part of the nature of cooking and serving meat anywhere. But changing gloves is good enough for us to feel comfortable eating at a restaurant. Places like Fired Pie (Ray and 101) do this happily with a smile on their face. 

However, the employee putting together our meals here was a middle-aged man whose attitude upon hearing this request was unacceptable. He rolled his eyes, made a big fuss about it, muttered to himself and his coworkers in Spanish, and went to go wash his hands (all we asked is that he change his gloves). If this happened only once, I would chalk it up to a bad day. However, he has done three times.

We spoke to the manager at the time, who said that she doesn't work nights so she isn't aware of his issues. She said she would talk to him, but neither she nor the employee offered an apology at any point. In this day and age, to be treated with disrespect just because you're vegetarian is unacceptable and offensive. Generally I'm a pretty mellow person and I don't make a big fuss about things, but it seems like this place has an issue with customer service and attitude.

So if you're a strict-ish vegetarian, either avoid this place or stomach the attitude and disrespect you're going to get with your food. Or just don't go at night (which is when the guy works apparently).

For what it's worth, the enchiladas were really good (with black beans and cheese for filling)."}
{"text":"Almost like chipotle.  I got the chicken salad and it was tasty and lots of toppings!  Nothing big to rave about.  One thing I really do love is the horchata!"}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Cafe Rio after hearing many great things about their food. I got two carne asada tacos that comes with rice and beans. Out the door it was $11 and some change. Kindly pricy but delicious food."}
{"text":"I have heard for years about Cafe Rio and how delicious it is,  I've never tried it myself until a week ago.  Let me just say, it is as good as everyone said it is!  All of the food is pretty good, but the pork and creamy tomatillo dressing are amazing. I also like the fresh made tortillas that they use for the tacos & burritos and the chips.  The only thing I haven't liked is the queso, I don't care for the extra things they mix in to it.  They give a free little kid quesadilla, which is good for me because my kids don't eat that much anyway.  I hate paying a ton for a kids' meal they don't even touch.  

The only downside is that it is a touch expensive.  I think the burrito pricing is similar to Chipotle or other places ($7.49), but Cafe Rio charges extra for sour cream or dressing.  The chips are also a bit expensive.  They do have daily specials, for example on Tuesdays tacos are $1.95.   If the pricing was a bit better, it would be 5 stars all the way...."}
{"text":"I love the vegetarian cafe rio salad! It's amazing! Ask for the shredded lettuce instead of the whole. It will make a huge difference!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is my new go to! Back home in Hawaii I had to drive 45 minutes to North Shore tacos to get my favorite sweet burrito. After moving to Scottsdale I learned that Cafe Rio was just down the street. When I found out they sold a sweet burrito, I had to try! Well, after my first bite I was hooked. The portions are big, the staff is super friendly, and the food just hits that spot. =)"}
{"text":"Love the fact that you can order from your phone and beat that ludacris line that's always at Cafe Rio, I would give it a 5 stars because it was my favorite place for lunch, but this last time I got a burrito there done enchilada style, it wasn't as appealing as I remember it being, the burrito kinda felt spongy, I still ate it ofcourse cause food l, but definitely changing up where I go to from now on"}
{"text":"Looks like from all the previous reviews on here I'm not alone with my complaints. This location is not managed well at all compared to other locations. This evening they were understaffed and the manager on duty herself was not able to communicate well and was quite rude to us. I have also noticed that they have beem trained to flood the enchilada style burritos with sauce to the point that is all you taste. On my first experience with that I took the burrito back and asked for a new one with less sauce and I always make sure to ask for less sauce now on here.
My big complaint from today is how the manager on duty checked us out at the register and denied us any stamps because we bought the taco special meals for Tuesdays. I have always been given stamps even for taco tuesday meals. She tried to tell me it was policy but if I would have known that I wasn't getting stamps up front I wouldn't have come on Tuesday and I would have spent my $17 on a couple other meals and not tacos. If that's the corporate policy I would like to see it in writing and I fel it was a bait and switch tactic they have played me. I will no longer be a loyal Taco Tuesday customer and they will see me much less often there."}
{"text":"Favorite place ever. Love all the people that work there. Have gone 20+ times and never a bad experience. Always make sure you're satisfied and best food ever!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I usually get a salad. All of their meats are tender with lots of flavor. Long lines at lunchtime move pretty quickly. Nice service too!"}
{"text":"Service is awful. None of the workers clearly want to be there. Each time I go they mess something up on my order because they are talking to each other about boyfriend problems or other things going on in their life. I haven't been to a fast food place this awful regarding customer service. Seems like others have noticed this as well. Maybe I wouldn't be as picky if I didn't have experience in customer service. But where is the management?"}
{"text":"This review is not about the food. The food is delicious, at least the chicken salad is. This review is about the service. I have placed an online order for this location on Camelback three times and two of the times it has been horrible. The first order placed, no issues. Hence the reason for a second time ordering online. The second time, the manager stated the order wasn't placed when we had a confirmation number. This pushed our order from being ready at 12:00pm to now being ready at 12:25pm. I chalked this bad experience as a glitch in the system. So today, 3/3/17, I placed an online order.  The order was to be ready at 12:15 pm. I got to the restaurant early and waited in the pick-up line. There were three people in-front of me. When the first person finished up the phone rang and the cashier took the call. He began to take the phone order and 10 minutes later, he still was on the phone and the next person in line still wasn't spoken to or helped. After almost 20 minutes of waiting in line for our already placed orders, I asked to speak to the manager. I explained to her that I understood it was lunch and they were busy but the cashier is still on the phone and the regular line is moving faster than we are. Her response was, \"what's your name\". I gave her my name, she grabbed my food and cashed me out. She was not helpful or supportive. I wasn't looking for a handout but an acknowledgement of the length of time spent in a line and not being helped is unacceptable. 

I will continue to go to Cafe Rio but I am not going to support this location until they can hire or train other people to work during the lunch rush hour."}
{"text":"Food is good but customer service needs work. Took my 2 year with me, figured we'd share a burrito, asked for a side of rice and beans in a small Dixie cup, got charged a dollar for each.  Never once was offered the free cheese quesadilla meal for children under six. Maybe that's my fault for only scanning the menu, just would have been nice to have been offered the free meal when I was ordering or when I complained that the rice and beans were for my kid who I was holding.

On the plus side, I will never forget they offer a free kids meals!!! As long as you ask for it."}
{"text":"Super slow...love the food but it takes forever to get it.  By far the slowest cafe rio I've been to."}
{"text":"KILLER! Yes same concept as the others blah, blah, blah. The food is wayyyyyy better though. There is flavor here. Reminds me of when Chipotle started back in the day before they sold out. The grilled chicken is amazing and not rubbery like the rest. The grilled chicken salad, if done with the lime cilantro dressing, is simply the best I've ever had anywhere. I can't believe I just said that but it's true. Lets not even go over all the different drinks you can make at the drink station. They are all equally killer.
As far as bad service others are talking about, I personally have had no issue. Yes it has the normal saturation of non English speakers that tends to confuse things a little, but this ain't Becketts Table either. These kids aren't getting rich throwing this stuff together for you and thankfully for us they took the job to serve us this great food. That's why we go. We are lazy and want to eat! No offense of course. 
Anyway I think it's great and a welcome addition in the CenPho 'hood."}
{"text":"Heck yes!! Since moving to the west valley I can only dream of Cafe Rio in Gilbert, but no more! This location is still a drive, but its much closer. I'm still hoping they open one near west gate. 

Cafe Rio how I love thee, let me count the ways. I was first introduced to it by my boyfriend who went regularly in a different state and swore I would like it, even though I'm not a fan of Mexican (yes! I said it!) I ordered a chicken salad with pinto beans and all the fixings, extra cheese (shredded). As directed by my man I chose the tomatillo ranch dressing. 

Taste buds delight!!! Fresh quality ingredients. No iceberg lettuce here! Great meat, and no fat/gristle like Chipotle loves to charge you premium prices for. Everything is delicious. I've been going to Cafe Rio now for 4 years and I'm still having a love affair with their salads. I keep meaning to try a burrito but I just can't pass up the crisp coolness of the romaine lettuce and cilantro. Mmmm."}
{"text":"What happened to you Rio! I Used be recognized by name now new employees every week some with attitude! I've never seen someone try to work so fast somehow the line is so slow, no efficiency!"}
{"text":"It sucks to give such a great place this review but here we go...
Okay so Café Rio is my girlfriend's favorite place to eat. If I said okay she would literally eat there every single day. Whether it's tacos, a burrito or a salad we are never disappointed. We used to go to the one off the 60 but since we moved over near San Tan Mall we have been going to this location. It is such a let down which sucks... :( The service is absolutely the worst. They are so sooo slow and have the worst customer service. 
Here are just a couple of examples: 
1) We went there a few weeks ago and there was NO ONE and I mean not even 1 person in line. We walked in an nobody greeted us, nobody paid any attention to us for a good 5-10 minutes. Everyone that was working was just standing around talking to each other behind the counter other than the girl at the cash register. She patiently waited for someone to come help us, as it was not her duty that day, but once she realized that was not happening she came to help. I wish I knew her name because she is the only employee at this location who is ALWAYS nice, friendly and helpful. Anyways, once she came to help the rest of the employees continued to just chat even though the phones were ringing and she helped us all the way through. 
2) Another example was one day we called to place an order to-go, when we place the order for ONE CHICKEN SALAD, we were told the wait would be about an hour and 45 minutes.... I'm sorry but WHAT?!?!? The guy said if you come in there is nobody in line so it would be quicker... I am sorry but that just makes no sense. If I could have come in and wasn't on a time crunch I would have! I understand places get busy but for a \"fast food\" type place that is just ridiculous. 

We have never had any issues with the food, thankfully, because my girlfriend would be crushed. Hopefully a manager will read this review and see that something needs to be done at this location about the employees. Customer service is SO important. We get it that you're just there to make a paycheck but come on.. Put a smile on your face and act like you care about your customers!"}
{"text":"This place is just like Chipotle. And is pretty much a carbon copy of other restaurants that try to copy chipotle. It's slightly more pricy and really the food is not really that great. It wasn't bad, but nothing outstanding.For some reason they put cheese and lettuce on the tray and put the stuff through a heater which is the same as Costa vida. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"Wow.
It has been a long time since I've been to a place that has totally blown my mind in mediocrity.   First a 50 minute wait to order food.  The floors were filthy and nobody cleaning tables.

The only thing positive was the food is tasty.

At 12:15pm midweek, both brewed iced tea containers were empty, as well as two soda fountain jets.  Floors were a mess as well as the drink table.  

There appeared to be no adult management, even after  customers before and after me complained about the lack of beverages.   What better way to increase profits than charge $2.49 for an empty cup of ice?  

I went online to their customer survey, but they care so little about \"customers\" that they do not want you to provide your contact information to get a response from them.   

Located down the road from Intel, they can just sit back and let the money roll in with pissingly poor 
Service without consequence."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and has the best taco salad and cilantro lime dressing!! Price point is also great and they have a kids menu. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"1 star for customer service: there rude, impatient, don't listen to what you want on your food THAT YOUR PAYING FOR!!!!

But a 5 star for their food LOL it's bomb! 


HIRE NEW WORKERS ASAP!!! And tell them to SMILE & LISTEN!!!!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is SO good. Everything is so fresh and the house dressing is amazing!! So much better than chipotle."}
{"text":"The food was great. Clean restaurant but sometimes line is too long. Their burrito is sooooooo good"}
{"text":"Nor sure why this place is only 3 stars. Everytime I've been here the food has been great. Kinda sucks to stand in line, but it's worth it for those fresh tortillas! I had the tamale special today with the sweet barbacoa. It was awesome. Good food at a good value."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Smelled great though. The worker kept asking us what was ours(?) I don't know, isn't that your job to kept track? We watched the kids break the cup for our salsa then put it on the tray, then puts in the queso in the cup, overflows everywhere. My tacos were ready, he puts them in front if me. The other worker tells him you need to ask them if they want lettuce and salsa. Then the little counter girls asks which is ours. I felt like I was doing most of their job by telling them where my chips were, which salsas it comes with, then they forgot the other half of my order. I just left.

I had never been to one of these so didn't know what to expect."}
{"text":"I never thought I would be writing this review.... I fell in love with cafe rio while vacationing in Utah. I was THRILLED when I had one of my very own right down the road!!

Because I loved their food so much, I've given this place many chances. Tonight was the last straw. Hoping for a quick queso snack, I waited in a long line. The employee then started dishing out queso from a dish that had been sitting on the back counter, and trying to get enough out of the bottom. GROSS! I was somewhat relieved when she spilled that cup, only to be quickly disappointed that she did not offer to make a fresh batch. She just said they were out and asked if I wanted anything else. Ummm no. Too much inconsistency and bad service, sad to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place.  The pork barbacoa is my favorite.  Awesome fresh-squeezed lemonade.  FYI, I like it better without enchilada style."}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Rio last Thursday while waiting for an item to be tailored at Men's Warehouse. The lady behind the counter asked the gentleman in front of me what he would like and asked him if he wanted cheese, guacamole etc. she gets to me and I told her I wanted the tamales and she asked me what salsa I wanted and I told her the spicy one then she doesn't ask me if I want cheese like she asked the previous man and she just sprinkles cheese all over it and I'm lactose intolerant so I advise her but she got upset and had an attitude and angrily dumped the food in the trash. Then she asked me what I wanted on it one by one, which she should have done in the first place. I got my food and ate it because I had paid for it, but the tamales were gross to me. I expected the food to be better and better service."}
{"text":"I LOVE CAFE RIO!! I have been going to various locations for about eight years and I LOVE their pork! YUM! YUM! It is VERY unique. Try it out (: Even my super picky mom likes it. Wow!"}
{"text":"I always love stopping at Café Rio when I come to Mesa. As a matter of fact even if I'm just driving through I have to go out of my way just to get a smothered burrito! It's all about the sweet pork and enchilada style!"}
{"text":"I went to order my food the girls serving my food kept talking to the cashier and not paying attention to what I was trying to order.
The music was loud and the other two white ladies were complaining about the music and the Mexican man told them to deal with it very unprofessional. 

As I'm trying to decide what to order the girl then
 goes on talking with the other girl about a meeting coming up and they and talked about this while I'm waiting to finish my order which I had to ask for more serving because of the very small portions then she was putting on my tin foil plate after I'm done 

I go to the cashier I told her I ordered the special and that the drink I want it then she tells me that it's going to be extra 
I told her  the special comes with a drink her being the cashier you would think that she would know.
 At the drink station they have syrup to go into your drinks they were empty and sticky.
 when I asked for help to refill them the girl who was the cashier said she didn't even know where to get them so I chose a different drink 
Chipotle I will be back many times over and over sorry I went to the worst place ever.
Another thing that aluminum bowl or dish made it hard to warm up your food at work in the microwave inconvenience.!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!! This is why I always choose chipotle over cafe rio. The staff here is incredibly rude and do not care about delivering even a DECENT customer experience. Super slow at making the food as well. Great tasting food but I HATE coming here because of how rude they are."}
{"text":"Delicious! I fell in love with Cafe Rio while attending Brigham Young University. So glad to have a location in Chandler. Love anything with the sweet barbacoa pork. Thanks to the friendly staff at the grand opening!"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price, and their mint line-ade... Is amazing. I'll go for the the drinks only!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh ingredients and tasty entrees. The lines are long but only because the food is so good, so make sure to time your trip accordingly. 

I usually get the chicken enchiladas or the steak salad. Both are two of my faves. 

Plan to come again!!"}
{"text":"I want to go three out of five stars because paying 59 cents for a side of sour cream is ridiculous. However, I think they have some of the best tacos around. They make their own tortillas right in front of you that are incredible. The meat and vegetables always taste fresh, and taco-tuesday is always a good deal. Missing one star because their seating is set up such that if you dine in during prime lunch time hours you're going to have people rubbing their butts across your back as they try to squeeze passed to an open table."}
{"text":"I thought I'd try this place again, but that was a bad decision! My salad had watery brown lettuce, brown watery guacamole and was honestly just gross. It is over $10 for a salad here and that is crazy to me since its neighbors are Gadzooks and Chipotle where I can get 4-5* quality for at least a couple of dollars less."}
{"text":"I love when I get to splurge and enjoy some sweet pork. But the last time I came in I was disappointed. I stopped in at about 8:45 and ordered the same thing I always get, a sweet pork salad. This time it was different though. First the girl asking everyone what they wanted was a very poor listener, she asked multiple times. \"What can I get for you?\" \"A sweet pork salad\" \"what kind of meat?\" That's pretty much how that went with man and the 2 people in front of me, I didn't think it was that difficult to remember. She just couldn't stay focused because she wanted to talk to the girl working the grill. And she totally skipped a person in front of me (which she did ask what he wanted and just didn't make it) she just wanted to tell her gossip story to the girl at the grill. Second I didn't get the tortilla strips on my salad which I have always had before, oh and I would of asked for them but they didn't even have them out. I'm assuming that since they close in just over and hour they were getting ahead of clean up. Absolutely ridiculous, if I come in when there is over an hour until close I expect to get what I would of got if I came in one hour after open. If I get any less then what it is suppose to come with then I should get some money taken off. I shouldn't have to pay for something I did not receive."}
{"text":"I have had good and bad experiences here I typically have problems with cores or lettuce in my salad. They also can't seam to cut the lettuce correct it is to big or not cut at all. I really love the flavors but they need some work on cutting things better. I recommend the sweet pork can go wrong with it! Hopefully they teach the employees to not serve bad parts of lettuce."}
{"text":"Super yummified!! Haven't had 1 thing I don't like as of yet! Shredded chicken, shredded beef, grilled chicken, rice, tortillas, Pico - all just mouth watering yummy!! 
So glad the last place is gone & they moved in!! Woohoo!!"}
{"text":"I would frequent this place more often if the service was better. The food is great but the staff is terrible. I have come here many times and every time I order they act like it is an inconvenience to make the food. The manager really needs to have a talk with the employees about how to treat a customer!"}
{"text":"Placed my order online at 11:15am to be ready at noon. Got there a few minutes after 12 and got in the pick up line. It took 30 minutes just to get to the front of the pickup line. And then on top of that when I did finally get there to pick up my order, it wasn't made yet. I waited another 15 minutes for them to make my order that was supposed to be ready for pick up 45 minutes before that. That was bad enough but then my order was wrong. And to top it all off, when a few customers let them know they were out of ice, an employee went over to the drink machine, took the lid off, and then pushed the ice down with the lid to the machine. That is absolutely disgusting and unsanitary. I will not go back."}
{"text":"I have rated Cafe Rio a 3, as I did like the food.  However, what's not great is that even though
I purchased a vegetarian burrito, I had been charged for a chicken burrito.  The menu as you walk in the door states that they have vegetarian burrito's( no meat, no cheese) however i was charged for a chicken burrito, I  inquired with the cashier to why I was being charged for chicken she had no answer for it, and stated  that she had no control on how they charge things.   I really don't think that I should be charged for chicken, if it's not on of the food selections that I chose.  I don't understand the rationale for it."}
{"text":"Love the food but hate the service.  The service employees preparing the food are to busy socializing with each other instead of paying attention to customer.  I had to repeat my order 5 times before they got it right.  The staff needs to slow down, give eye contact to the customer and quit talking to each other about who is dating who.....what their plans are later tonight....and stop bitching to each other about who is not working their stations.  Bad customer service!!!"}
{"text":"I come here often as I work nearby and the hours here are very accommodating. 5 stars on food for me. The problem here are the employees. They seem more interested in socializing over giving good customer service. 
Last week I went in with my sister for dinner and in the corner of the restaurant were 4 of the employees still with their work uniforms on, yelling and laughing in the corner. They were obnoxiously loud. Then throughout our meal they continued to stare and give us looks from across the room. It is completely disrespectful and ridiculous how they acted. 
I have also had employees try and charge me for the side of rice and beans that are included in the meal. Watch for this, its been more than once.
Love the food. Cant stand the unprofessional workers. Will go out of my way to avoid this location. There is a severe lack of management."}
{"text":"I give it a really pretty good. I had a beef burrito smothered and i like the taste of the green sauce on top.
Rice and black beans fill it up and the limeade is fabulous"}
{"text":"SUPER SLOW! Never been to such a slow Cafe Rio. There was no one in line, but it too 10-15 minutes to get food. Poorly organized staff."}
{"text":"I have given cafe Rio so many tries. Everyone seems to love it there, but I haven't had such luck. One thing that has remained consistent in my experience is there is NO flavor to any of the food. I went here again today so very excited to try the \"spicy green chile habanero pork.\" Something spicy! I was so excited! After being skipped in line (not a huge deal) I ordered my food. Upon receiving it, it smelled sweet, like a donut. I tried it anyway. There wasn't a whole lot of meat and the meat wasn't drained very well so the crispy quesadilla was more of a soggy mess. After navigating around the soggy mess I finally got a few choice bites and it was sweet! I looked at my receipt to make sure I ordered the spicy pork and not the sweet \"barbacoa,\" my receipt indicated I had ordered correctly so I took it up to trouble shoot. The women i spoke with, I recognized as the person who skipped over me in line initially. I voiced my concern, \"the receipt doesn't mean anything,\" she said. I proceeded to explain to her that I was certain I ordered the spicy pork. She then took my fork and dug into my food and replied \"this is the spicy pork, see the green chile?\" At this point I was convinced my opinion as a customer didn't matter. I threw my food away and sat down. Then I went back up to ask what the manager's name was and a different employee said she would send her over. The manager was nicer but didn't seem to care that I was unhappy with my food but even more unhappy with the lack of customer service I received from her employee. She told me that the same pork was used for both dishes, that they don't make anything spicy there because if there are two serranos in the regular salsa customers will complain that it is too spicy. I guess if I want Mexican food with flavor, I need to get it elsewhere because this food is flavorless and the company doesn't seem to want to keep their business. My reason for writing this today is to warn their false advertising- nothing is spicy there and the lemonades are labeled as tangy, they are not, they are overly sweet too. I like sweet for dessert, not in my main course."}
{"text":"Enchiladas and so forth.  Food is way better than Chipotle I say.  Can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"Cafe rio is overrated. The sweet pork and tortillas are good but there proportions are terrible. Sometimes there is no meat and WAY to much cheese and vise versa. You also have to pay for sauces and sour cream. Overall, they do have fresh food but it isn't prepared well and I felt sick after I went there."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, over priced food.  Charged  $8.99 for a bean burrito (beans and tortilla only)."}
{"text":"I'll start with the positive.  Tortillas are made on site & super fresh. Unfortunately that's where it ends.  This was my first visit so I wasn't really sure what to order, had the pork burrito (rice & beans inside).  The gal preparing my food looked super annoyed that I took more than 10 seconds to choose between green or red sauce, talked so low I couldn't understand her, and once I selected the red sauce she put so much on my burrito it's all I could taste.  And it's SUPER sweet.  Not my thing.  If the meat, beans, or rice were good or not, I have no idea.  Tried my brothers shredded beef burrito, same thing.  All one note and super sweet.  Guess I'll go back to Moreno's if I want real Mexican food I can taste."}
{"text":"So I need to update my previous review. This location has gotten a lot better. It seems like they needed to iron  a few kinks out from being a newly opened location. They are no longer chinsy on the meat and the overall quality of the food is better. I've been going to Cafe Rio a long time and I'm glad this place stepped up their game. I'd recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"I love cafe rio. Gotta love the sweet pork salad. My only disappointment was that they didn't have the strawberry lemonade but I know it's seasonal."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the food at cafe rio and most locations we'd give a 4 or 5. However this location we've had some difficulty.   The most recent,  we ordered pick up (I'm just home from the hospital so my husband wanted to grab something easy and good).  When he got home everything was wrong.   The burrito was not enchilada style or the correct ingredients,  the chicken tortilla soup was just broth no chicken cheese etc, the side of lime and tortilla had the lime covered in the strips so they were soggy, and the chips and salsa were missing.   We thought perhaps we ordered incorrectly so we looked at the included detail receipt and it showed what we ordered not what we received.  Had it been just one or two things we'd probably not bother but we called to see about getting the correct items.   The woman who answered was rather rude, doubting the order was wrong,  finally begrudgingly said she'd remake the burrito and soup but insisted the chips weren't missing. The Tatum and cactus location is a bit further but they are always friendly,  after this worth the extra distance."}
{"text":"This place has gone to down hill in the last year. I used to come here once a week, then biweekly, then monthly, now here and there. Today the chicken had to be soaked in 4 cups of salt. Had to choke down the tacos I ordered. Rather eat that then change the order cause the awesome staff will have you wait 10 mins and then miss the order. Now they had a coke bottle on display on the edge of the counter with a stupid sticky note \"now selling\" that another customer knocked over on accident, CAUSE IT WAS ON THE EDGE! Then they clean up the glass but not the coke so it's now sticky all over the floor. Napkins, straws and lids all left over the floor. Garbage cans overflowing and the staff screwing up your order 99.9% of the time! No thanks, rather go to chipotle or qdabo as it's much better and your food isn't drenched in grease. The owner should really analyze this place and evaluate the staffing."}
{"text":"Delicious food and fresh ingredients. Their homemade tortillas are my favorite and love that they give a free Niño quesadilla to young children. Ordering via phone for take out is far from fast..."}
{"text":"Poor service tonight. Employees were yelling at each other and snapping at customers. They were not prepared. Not recommended tonight"}
{"text":"Very tasty and plenty of space. I always like Chipotle, but it gets a bit crowded. This food tastes great and the tortillas are rolled out and baked right in front."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio leaves Chipotle with no leg to stand on. The salad @Rio vs Chipotle can't even be compared as they are just so different in so many ways. The quality of food is always consistent & the service is always friendly."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. I called in an order, waited 30 minutes for it, kept checking on it, and it turns out they never started preparing it.  One customer in line told me she waited 1 hour for her food; meanwhile, workers were taking breaks getting fountain drinks while customers were waiting."}
{"text":"Super happy they opened close by! Love this place. The food is AMAZING. You can't go wrong with their pork taco's--delicious. I've stopped by and they are very busy! So, expect a wait, but not too long. Even when it's busy I still manage to find good seating. And, you cant' go wrong with their Taco Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Chipotle style format - 6 menu items, built in front of you. But they have special difference - they cook the tortilla in front of you. Very focused on fresh. A sweet pork barbacoa burrito enchilada style for $8.63! I found the burrito better than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Fresh Mexican grill. Food is tasty and the tortillas are made fresh right in front of you. Great variety of burros, tacos, etc. and made to order.  The shredded chicken breast burro with medium sauce enchilada style was excellent!  Fun atmosphere snd happy, helpful employees. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here last night because we both heard from different people this place had amazing food. We went through the line pretty fast and my boyfriend was finished ordering his burrito when she started to roll it up and re opened it back up to put cheese inside. Well he cannot eat cheese and since it was our first time, we weren't aware that they put cheese inside. The lady tried to pick it out, but ultimately had to start over. From there, she was not very nice anymore. A little annoyed that she had to start over. We apologized and said it was our first time in the restaurant and we didn't know how it works since every place does it different. Then she made my two tacos on corn since I cannot do wheat and we cashed out. $26 for two small drinks, a burrito, and two tacos with rice and beans. Seems pricey for the amount of food we had. I noticed the corn tortillas looked a lot thicker than a usual one and not as white so I went up and asked the lady at the register. I was told the soft corn tortillas have a little bit of flour in them. They are NOT gluten free, but apparently the hard corn tortilla shells are. So I asked if I could get new ones and they just gave me two hard taco shells. Okay fine whatever. Quickly dumped all of my taco insides on top of the shells and made it like a tostada. My boyfriend thought his burrito was average, but my food was terrible. We both agreed the rice was very odd tasting and was too hard. The food does not match the price."}
{"text":"Chili roasted beef burrito with the medium green sauce is amazing!  I had the enchiladas here once but ended up being sad because the burrito is so much better.  Portion is huge, so come hungry or take some home for later."}
{"text":"I finally made it here for lunch today. Not in the mood for meat, I ordered a veggie burrito, which consisted of rice and black beans. (The menu also listed guacamole as a vegetarian ingredient, but that was conspicuously absent from my burrito.) I specified \"enchilada style\" for my burrito, meaning that they coated my burrito with a hot sauce and melted cheese. Overall, my first experience was pretty favorable. The tortilla was fresh and, since heated to melt the cheese on top, soft and easy to cut. Together, the black beans and rice made for a great combination, but the \"enchilada style\" sauce, while mildly spiced, could have been a little spicier. If you are looking for an authentic Mexican culinary experience, Cafe Rio would probably not be on your short list, but the ingredients are fresh, the food is good, and the menu makes for very good Mexican fast-food. I would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"At Cafe Rio in Phoenix and sorely disappointed with the service and the food. The chicken is dry and flavorless and the service is below average. I will look for a better venue next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Multiple positive experiences here, so I decided to leave a review. Excellent customer service! There was a little mix up with my wife's order, and they fixed it immediately, within one minute, no joke. Each person serving us was kind. The manager Cici was pleasant and friendly, she complimented my pregnant wife and made her feel good. Oh, and the pork burrito was superb!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, I seriously do.  BUT, I don't.  Yes, they are really proud of their fresh product but the product just doesn't taste all that great.  The pork is so sweet it tastes like it should be a dessert and I really don't want  a whole stalk of cilantro on my tacos, just pull the leaves off and throw away the stems.  The tortillas are homemade and are great.  Speed of Service is a huge chalenge which they haven't figured out yet either."}
{"text":"Great food, Horrible customer service

I love the food here but the rude service provider kept asking me to replete my simple order then tossed our trays down towards the register.
Went out to the patio to eat and could not kind a clean table. Looking around the windows were filthy, trash laying around the patio, the trash can was over flowing and the employees were out back smoking behind the patio. Not impressed.
HIRE A PROFESSIONAL MANAGER it would make an immediate difference."}
{"text":"I am so excited that they opened a Cafe Rio here in Phoenix! Their fresh tortillas are AMAZING! I love getting their Salads with chicken and their house ranch dressing is to die for! I think that is one of the reasons why I go there! I just wished they had a few more options for toppings! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the enchilada special and wasn't informed a substitution from one type of chicken to another was a $1.00 fee - per enchilada!  The rewards coupons from their website can't be honored because they are not up to speed.  The food is ok, but not great considering how much they charge for it.  

Would come in sporadically, but now will just be avoiding them altogether.  Go eat a sit down meal with free chips and salsa if you are going to pay this much."}
{"text":"We often came here for Taco Tuesday and loved this place. Normally I would give it a 4-star but I was really disappointed today. To fit in busy schedule like a lot of us, I purposely pre-ordered on-line around noon for 5 pm pick-up. I arrived a couple minutes before 5, expecting to pick up my order, deliver dinner for a family in need that I signed up tonight's meal plan spot, so I could pick up my daughter from school in time. When I arrived, I saw the line started and nothing on table ready for pick up. I was a bit worried. After cashier pulled up my orders, I didn't see them start making it either (they continue to deal with customers in line). Finally part of my order was ready around 5:10. However, I still didn't see them making the other part of my order. At 5:15 after several inquiries, I was standing by cashier with my arms crossed and staring at the guy who apparently is the manager. I knew it wasn't a pretty sight but I had to make a point at the time. The poor cashier already reminded him several times about my order and that's still the outcome. I finally got all my order at 5:25 for 5:00 pick-up. I could have just jump in line when I arrived. That would make the whole process much faster and not being ignored as such. 

The manager never came apologize or gave any explanation.

That 25 minutes delay caused my daughter to wait 20 minutes for parent pickup. That's a No-No for me. Unacceptable!

If you ever need catering or plan to order on-line so you are in control of your time, think twice when you place your order here."}
{"text":"I live down the street and have been here several times now. The tortilla shells are warm and fresh and the salsa is really fantastic! 

Here's the problem: there's WAY to much 'sauce' confined within the meat. By sauce I'm referring what the meat is cooked in. A couple times it seemed like I was eating a taco that had just sauce in it!"}
{"text":"Now that there's a Cafe Rio in my neighborhood, this may become a weekly habit very quickly, uh oh!! and I like their new Rewards program too ... I'm really in trouble now!"}
{"text":"The food is alright - not as good as I remember it being at other locations I used to frequent several years ago. Their salsas are kind of bland, as is the horchata (too watered down for my liking). The pork is stellar, I could eat that all day. Overall a decent place, I'll get it every once in awhile. Not the best, not the worst."}
{"text":"The staff here is never welcoming, rather they just stand there, say nothing, and don't greet you when you walk in. That should have been my first clue. My first couple times here were alright, no noticeable problems other than the fact that you have to yell to even be heard over the sneeze guard, and the cooks almost constantly get the order wrong and it has to be remade before it hits the end of the line.

My most recent time here has caused me to never want to return again. I went there when it wasn't that busy at all, so I figured it wouldn't be too bad. I usually order steak tacos for my boyfriend and a chicken salad for myself, pretty simple order with minimal alterations. When I went up to order and told them I wanted the steak tacos, the kid that was taking my order made a face at me and was silent (okay...wtf). I of course inquired why he was making the face and he finally answered that they were out of steak and in the process of making the next batch. Could have just said that from the start...awkward! Anyways, I end up waiting about 10 minutes for the steak to be ready. All the while the restaurant ends up emptying out until I am literally the only customer there. By the time they yell for me to inform me that the steak is ready and they are making my tacos, I go up to the register and my salad is already made. Weird, because I never told them what I wanted in there in the first place. So they rushed through making it for literally NO REASON. Hmm. I had it remade and to no surprise, as many other reviewers on here have noted, there was a chicken bone in my salad and the middle of the lettuce (which usually should never be in a quality salad) was in there and it literally looked like someone crapped out a salad and decided to sell it. Will never ever be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I discovered this little gem on a Tuesday afternoon. It was lunch rush, but the line still moved fairly fast, and gave us time to look over the menu. They had a taco special for Taco Tuesday and they were each a very generous portion, served with homemade tortillas being rolled and warmed right in front of you :) It was a nice change from Chipotle. I got the bbq pork barbacoa and a side of beans. The beans were kind of slopped to the side and spread all over the plate and foil, but they gave me a large amount, so it didn't matter too much. We also shared an appetizer of guac and salsas, which was huge.  It included drinks and we only paid about $20~ Everything tasted very fresh and we are anticipating the Scottsdale location!

P.S They have horchata"}
{"text":"Crowded and slow, I must have waited in line for over 20 minutes. Additionally, it was my first time at Cafe Rio, and the workers were quite rude. It's difficult to tell which ingredients are free for certain meals, and rudely would say certain items weren't included in what I ordered (that's fine, I'll pay extra!) They were visibly annoyed while I was ordering."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio's sweet pork barbacoa burrito but the portion size at this place is ridiculous. The burrito itself is huge, not complaining, but then every little add on costs money. I can't describe how small the guacamole portion is... It's $1.99 extra and you get the smallest scoop (they use a melon baller is what it looks like). $2 for a tablespoon of guac? Then extra red sauce is $1! Are you kidding? They even charge for extra sour cream and cheese. We ordered burritos online today to pick up and the \"extras\" we asked for were not even in the bag when we got home. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions and typically the service is pretty good and the food is always delicious. However tonight I'm completely turned off from the staff. It took exactly 20 minutes from when I ordered to when I paid.

There was one man in front of me who ordered a chicken and steak taco. He also asked for chips and quest and the girl told him they didn't have enough to give him a full order, he said that was fine. I guess I didn't want to order that anyways...it's 7PM, how do you not have more prepped?

Then the girl said \"ma'am what would you like on your tacos which I ordered two sweet pork. I said lettuce when I realized she had chicken in her hands from the guy in front of me. He didn't want lettuce so she just picked it out. Then instead of grabbing my tacos she grabs the order of the woman behind me!

I am awkwardly standing there and the woman in line with me asked me what happened to my food and I said \"it's right there I guess they are skipping me.\"

The cashier rang her up and gave her a coupon to return for a free dessert. I paid and redeemed my loyalty drink and left. 

Completely understaffed and untrained."}
{"text":"So disappointed that our favorite place has gone down hill in quality and service so badly. We used to eat here 1-2 times a week since they opened. The last 3 times we have gone, they have about 7-8 people working and are always out of something, causing our wait for our food tone long which is not why we go to a \"quick dining experience\". The food does not taste as good as it used to. They also are starting to charge for everything, today I ordered a salad as I always do and my dressing cup was not filled all the way so I asked for a mini cup of it to supplement what the didn't give me after I left I realized they charged me for it. The place looks messy and the kitchen dirty very unlike the way it used to look. Sooooo sad because our entire family of 5 loves eating here a quick way to grab a healthy bite and bring it home on my \"not cooking\" days."}
{"text":"They have $1 Taco Tuesday so I wanted to give them a try instead of hitting up my usuals in the area, Espo's or Los Taquitos. 

Mistakes were made.

Service was not great and there was a disgruntled vibe overall. I asked for pico to be put on the tacos directly (bad move I guess) because they sloshed it on sloppily and a ton of water from the tomatoes made them ultra soggy, nearly sopping wet. Any extras cost a buck more so the tacos are pretty barebones with just lettuce and pico. These dollar tacos are a bit bigger than the dollar  tacos at other places, but the quality/authenticity was way worse.

Hard pass for future taco tuesdays that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Nice workers and good food. It seems to have the problems that a new location would have but I'm hopefully they will get them worked out soon.


The sweet pork tacos and burritos are awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing handmade tortillas and sweet pork. I usually order the pork tacos, pork salad, or pork burrito. It's all about the pork. The tres leches is also delicious. Much better than chipotle if you know how to order. My favorite casual dining restaurant in the Phoenix metroplex."}
{"text":"I ate a sweet pork burrito from here and it was the so much better than Chipotle. You get way more food for your money and when you show your friends, you'll never have to hear \"let's go to Chipotle\" again. Definitely the place to get Mexican food for sure. Couldn't have been more certain on that."}
{"text":"Sweet pork barbacoa salad with creamy tomatillo dressing is great!!  Unfortunately it racks up calories for a healthier alternative.  3 stars for taste, docked a few for lack of healthy options."}
{"text":"I feel like you can never go wrong with Cafe Rio. I always order the pork salad unless it's Tuesday then I do Taco Tuesday! The only negative thing from our visit was they were sold out of the Tres Leches."}
{"text":"The food seemed well prepared and reasonably priced, and the portions were certainly generous. But the 2 stars is because something in their rice is sweet. I don't know if it's orange juice or what, but it tastes like they added a bunch of sugar to it. Since rice was a key ingredient in my burrito, I couldn't get past that. It really ruined the meal. If I ever go back and get something without the sweet rice, I may give more stars."}
{"text":"2 words, TACO TUESDAY!!  It is becoming our family thing on Tuesdays.  Very good tacos and the tortillas are heavenly!!"}
{"text":"Bomb! Way better than Chipolte!! All food is good and price is cheap. Like authemtic mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 830 (they close at 10), there were 2 tables seated with a total of 6 people plus 7 people working plus the manager. We walked up to the line (already half broken down and two employees cleaning) and the two employees who were standing there took off their gloves and walked away without saying anything. We waited 4 minutes before a girl came over, laughing about whatever convo she just had, asking what we would like. My wife ordered the sweet pork, they're out. She ordered the new special Green chile pork, they're out. She settles for barbacoa. I order my burrito, ask for the grilled chicken, they also out. At this point, I ask for the manager. He comes out and I ask what's the deal with everything being out and how long to get what we'd like. He tells me it will be 45 mins to an hour for chicken and no more pork until tomorrow and literally laughs. An hour for grilled chicken breast? We walked out and will never return."}
{"text":"I got a promotion offer from Cafe Rio in my email and in app notification on National Burrito Day, which was earlier this month; $2 off any burrito-definitely not something I can finance my kids education with, but a worthy incentive to eat at a place I've enjoyed several times before and my wife absolutely loves-I usually get her gift cards for Cafe Rio on top of anything else for Christmas/Birthday, she likes it that much. 

Back to my sad experience...so we went to Cafe Rio to get some burritos that day.  The service was lack luster, I had to repeat what I wanted several times; the appearance of the assembly line was messy and not maintained at all.  I ordered a Steak Burrito, which is not cheap (over $10) and the amount of steak I received was pathetic; I politely asked if that was really all the meat they were putting in it and all I got was a rude \"yes\" and on to the veggies we went...as we were getting our burritos to go, I asked for my pico de gallo to be put in a little cup so it wouldn't make a soggy mess of my burrito on the drive home.  This was not done and was just one of the issues we had on this visit. 

Finally, we both had our burritos and were at the register, where I had the Cafe Rio App open, showing the cashier the promotion I had been notified about.  This seemingly seemed to only confuse the poor kid; upon getting a manager for help, it turned out that nobody there had heard of National Burrito Day or its corresponding offer.  The manager literally gave me an attitude about me wanting them to follow through with their offer and refused to do anything of the such; ultimately I didn't get a discount, all I ended up with were soggy, overpriced burritos when we made it home. Poor experience, I will be hard pressed to go back; my wife has a good amount of money left on her gift card and isn't sure she even wants to use it again."}
{"text":"I was surprised to read the not so complimented reviews for this place. My husband and I never heard about the place when we moved near the Tolleson area, but decided to try it out when we were driving by it. Granted, I was extremely hungry from the move which the thought came to my mind on why the food was so good. My husband and I decided to go back for another try. The food was still AMAZING! The sauces have a great flavor along with the meats. Especially the sweet pork. The price could be a little less, but it's so good that I will continue to go back. I suggest for you to try it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Ok.. only 3 stars because half or order was no bueno.  First the service...I don't think the workers wanted to be there today.  The first Kay could hear me and I had to repeat myself but other than that...the young man making my food was nice & accommodating...made my food the way I want.  The cashier picked up my bag of food and dropped it on the counter...uh not sure why.

I ordered the taco salad..no beans but the works.  Got the creamy tomatillo dressing on the side.  AWESOME!  I loved that the tortilla was soft & not fried. 

My son ordered the sweet barbacoa.  He did not like it.  The meat wad soaked in an over powering BBQ sauce, little to no cheese on the tortilla. The foil wad messy due to the meat being place in the pan first (not sure why they do this ). He got rice & beans instead of the salad.  Looks good but too much BBQ, not enough cheese. 

We will go back though we will not order the Sweet Barbacoa again.  P.S. look at the meat before you selected it...most of the meat is soaked in thick sauce."}
{"text":"Just finished dining at Cafe Rio. It was so fresh and delicious! We got a chicken quesadilla & sweet pork enchiladas. Both entrees were fresh, hot and so tasty! We got some fresh limeades to drink which were very refreshing! The store was clean and all the staff was very friendly. Cece was especially helpful and friendly! She made it such an overall fabulous experience. We will definitely be back! Thanks for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"The steak entries on the menu say that it's prepared medium well & that you have to ask to have it well done, but yet when we asked for it that way, they gave us a lot of flack for it.

After I kept saying to the line server that we need it well done she went to the manager & he came over & said that the steak was sitting there a while in the warmers & that it should be well done by now.  
So we got our steak tacos & left & I admit the tacos taste great.  

Not a pleasant experience ordering the food because the line server kind of gave us a look like we were causing problems.  I couldn't have been the very first person ever to ask for this well done.  For the order experience I give it one less star.  Otherwise the food tastes great and it should be 4 if it weren't for these people.

It's sad because this was our very first visit to Cafe Rio anywhere.  I'll probably have to try it somewhere else now."}
{"text":"I have been completely here for a few years now and today was terrible 20 min waiting with 3 people ahead of me way to slow and thanks for taking my lunch time . Get it together"}
{"text":"I am really a big fan of Café Rio, but NOT this location. I have visited this location 6-10 times since living in the neighborhood, and I've noticed a serious decline in service and food quality (especially when compared to other locations in the valley). The employees don't wear nametags most likely because of their poor customer service skills and lack of interest in their jobs (including the manager, a dark haired guy, about 6'2.) The food quality today totally grossed me out-- the lettuce was wilted, guac was brown and other ingredients just seemed old. Definitely NOT worth the nearly $10 price tag for (1) salad... Unfortunately, I'll be adding this restaurant to my \"places not to go\" list."}
{"text":"Who needs Chipotle?

Made fresh daily. Even their tortillas. From scratch. They don't just warm them up like Chipotle does.

Don't be cheap. Pay the extra dollar for their fire-grilled steak. It's definitely worth it. We usually get the fire-grilled steak salad and burrito, but everything is great. They also offer a free quesadilla for the little ones and unlimited Horchata refills. :)"}
{"text":"I'm a huge Cafe Rio fan. I've been to three Café Rio's in Arizona and this is by far the most generous. The portions were large. The food was fresh. I will come back to this café Rio. 

I'm so glad they moved up north and now I don't have to drive to get this awesome food."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent value and great service. Always suggest the salad with the sweet pork Barbacoa. Excellent choice try it."}
{"text":"My family and I love Café Rio but the staff and management at this location is not friendly.  I would actually say that they're quite rude and so much so that I am suggesting to all my friends to avoid this location until they have a more customer service oriented team.   The tables are never used, floors full of food that's never mopped up, etc. I was asking for a slightly extra sauce, and was told with much attitude and I roll, \"nothing here is free, sir.\"  This is not the first time I have received a very bad attitude, and this will be the last time we come, sadly."}
{"text":"Sad to see this place only has 3 and 1/2 stars. The barbacoa (sp?) pork is to die for! I get it in a cheese quesadilla! Would totally eat it as my last meal on Earth if it came down to it ;D"}
{"text":"Well that settles it.  The next time I want Mexican food...I'll drive to Mexico!  Why is it apparently so difficult to get decent Mexican in Gilbert?!?!?"}
{"text":"I visited Cafe Rio Mexican Grill for the second time ever this past week with a friend and some coworkers. I was the only one of our group who had ever been before (the Gilbert location).

Long story short, we were all VERY impressed. We actually decided to come here instead of Chipotle for the novelty of trying something new and were SO glad that we did!

It was lunchtime and the line was pretty long, but the wait was well worth it. We were all really impressed to see tortillas being MADE FRESH while we waited. The sight and smell of that... YUM!

All the ingredients looked and tasted very fresh and the portion sizes MORE than justified the cost of the food. We all decided to order some variant of burrito and we all really enjoyed our meals.

The burritos are briefly toasted, too, which is just another tasty touch that you don't see elsewhere. I ordered my burrito enchilada-style, which means it was fairly swimming in sauce - just the way I like it!

To be honest, I would come to Cafe Rio again before going back to Chipotle. (And that's saying a lot, because I really do like Chipotle.)

If you haven't been to Cafe Rio Mexican Grill, I'd highly recommend it. You're bound to love the food and quick service, not to mention the quirky, colorful atmosphere and outstanding value.

Well done, Cafe Rio! Five stars.  :)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit after hearing great things about this restaurant.  I was a bit disappointed in their food though.  The restaurant itself was very cute and well decorated as well as clean.  The food was subpar and a bit pricey.  It is very similar to multiple other Mexican places I have been to and would not say it is anything special.

Nothing too great about this restaurant and would probably not recommend a friend to go."}
{"text":"Great food! Friendly service, great place to relax and have a great meal! Will definitely be back when I come back to Phoenix"}
{"text":"I love this place way too much. I've waited in half hour long lines at high peak dinner times because their food is so good!! Sweet pork salad is my favorite with their house dressing - so yum!! I have ordered on-line at busy dinner times and my order was ready before the pick up time - it's always a good idea to check any pick up order before you leave anywhere but I have not had any problems. 

The parking is a joke because there is so much over there - just be prepared. But so delicious!"}
{"text":"Brought my best friend to this location to try the sweet pork salad. To our surprise it was taco Tuesday and tacos were $1.95. 
We decided to share a salad and each get a taco to try it out. The food itself gets a 5/5 stars, but sadly the customer service drops it down to a 3. 

The sweet pork salad with house dressing is by far the best!never disappoints.

The service seemed rushed and the cashier was plain rude. The tables were dirty and trash cans were overflowing. The machines were out of ice and a bucket of crushed ice was placed next to the soda machines which was melting and people were  touching the ice with bare hands. (Yuck) 

This location has also not received the scanners so 
The app and rewards are useless since you cannot redeem or earn points. 

We will be back, but maybe just use the to-go option."}
{"text":"$14 for 2 tacos :O
VERY GOOD FOOD, LOVE IT!!
EXPENSIVE! 
VERY DIRTY GLASS DOOR (all the time, I come here often)(stupid people pushing the glass instead of the metal bar to open door)
Flour tortillas are always a bit salty. Always. Sometimes way to salty. Whoever is monitoring the quality and taste of the food is *cough* not doing his job*cough*. 

With this prices they should DEFIANTLY hire someone to exclusively clean the floors, glass doors, wipe tables and empty those trash bins...I haven't been in the restroom but I'm almost sure is a disaster as well. 

Everything costs \"extra\" here geez!!

Overall:
-good food
-needs to improve in clearness (a lot).
-kitchen guys could drop the \"I'm cool at my school\" attitude and be more professional in customer service and handling the food, which leads me to think if they even passed their pro handling food test by the City.

$14 for 2 tacos :O

{"text":"Obviously there is going to be a wait because this place is pretty delicious. This review is specifically for the cashier Sisi, for being so nice and making sure everything was in good order and we had everything we needed. Keep up your excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"Got the taco combination with steak. The taco was good, a bit too much lettuce. Since the taco looked big i figured one was enough since it got rice and beans too. The beans were good i got the pinto. The rice was not, i did not like the taste, and just left it...the staff was friendly, very enthusiastic. But though i was full, i didn't feel satisfied. Overall i may give this place another shot but no rice.
Still better than choipotle."}
{"text":"Ordered vegitarian enchiladas. Terrible. Just cheese inside with sauce and it was stone cold. No guacamole. Nothing extra. It was my first time coming to this place and it's terrible. I'll stick to Pot Belly right next door thank you much."}

{"text":"I came here for the first time with my boyfriend and my daughter. I bought a chicken burrito with pinto beans and cheese. Very simple. It was pretty good. Their tortillas are really good. My only complaint is the staff. They have a ton of younger people and they're all unprofessional. There were workers arguing in front of us an the girl who was taking our order looked like she hated her life. For burritos, I'll just stick to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre. This location was not very clean, and the food was not very good.  We did get our food pretty quickly but there was definitely nothing special about it. I would say it is a lamer, much lamer version of Chipotle, which is not much of a compliment"}
{"text":"I honestly love cafe rios food. There system may be kind of messy but the final product is delish! I think a person just needs to figure out how to order exactly what they want from the menu to be satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Is Monday 8:30pm and this place has a mess in the food line. Looks that they really don't take care maintaining fresh food in the end of the day. No black beans and they don't even have rice. What a Joke."}
{"text":"if you want to read a long drawn out process. Read about sqrt(-4)=2i.  That will keep you busy.  In my reviews I will stick to the food.  Not the endless chit chat that people like to ramble on about.  Who cares what the projection of the shadow on the statue during the November sun.  
I have never eaten here before.  I ordered the two enchiladas.  One had pork and the other steak.  I got a split of the black and refried or pinto beans too.  Plus a side of rice.  The food was really good.  I liked the enchiladas a lot.  The server made what she thought I would like.  This place is worth a shot.  Not sure about their chains or other locations, but try this one.  
Thanks and carry on Garth."}
{"text":"This place food is over salted and the staff here are incometent. This is NOT a substitute to chipotle."}
{"text":"Place look tacky ,  too much colors , ligths and some ugly chiles hanging.
Food could be better,  steak extra 1.50. Tomatillo sauce than is nothing but ranch and chile Serrano blended is a 1.00 for a side too,    My quesadilla was served on bottom of the round aluminum plate buried on lettuces, sour cream and pico,   Don't think is practical try to unburied your quesadilla from that mountain of lettuce ...    
Also very disorganized and dirty,(all toppings were all over their prep table).   I will not be back to eat there again"}
{"text":"I frequent this location of Cafe Rio and have always had a good meal. The food choices and plentiful and all of the meats are really good. I love that they make their tortillas in house and everything is always fresh and hot. I highly recommend downloading their app to get points that go towards free meals. My only complaint is the design of the restaurant compared to their newer locations. It's not at clean and modern looking but who cares when the food is great!"}
{"text":"If I could this place zero stars I would. I used to go to the cafe rio place in vegas and it was great now come to this location its terrible. I have been here a few times and each time customer service is worse. I went out of town for almost a year and its gotten worse. Its more expensive and quality is not up to par. When I walked in they were cleaning with 1 hr left till closing. I stood there for 5mins for someone to notice that I was waiting to be served finally someone came. He was very blunt and non chalant almost like I was bothering him. He didn't offer me any condiments either until I noticed I didn't have any at the cashier.  The cashier was just as awful as well. He didn't even hand me my receipt or change. I really love the cafe rio franchise but this location makes it difficult to be loyal. Good luck"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The person serving me rolled her eyes when I asked to not have cheese on a tortilla (I had never been given a choice). The other person literally did not guide me through any choices (he said \"what do you want?\"). Then he walked away in the middle of serving my sister. Awful awful. I asked for a manager and the person at the cash register looked at me like I was crazy. I will never go back. This place needs a manager and a major customer service overhaul."}

Just rude customer service"}
{"text":"My husband, 11month old daughter, and I came for dinner about 5:30. There was no line and it took more than 5 min for an employee to acknowledge we were standing waiting to order. My husband ordered a burrito with rice, no beans, and light sauce. He was not listened to at all. He was given a burrito with half the normal amount of meat (pork barbacoa) and then it was drowned in sauce. He's ordered it this way at other sites with no problem. 
I ordered a Nina quesadilla (which was acknowledged and forgotten) and a salad. He put the tortilla into the container and started piling the rice, beans, and meat on it. I said that normally it has the cheese melted  on the bottom to prevent the tortilla from getting soggy. The employee looked at me and said \"well do you want me to remake it?\" As if it was my fault he did it wrong initially. He threw the container to the trash from 3 feet away, threw a tortilla and cheese on the grill and walked away to the back. He didn't say anything and did not comeback with anything. He finished my salad, but only provided half the normal amount of rice, beans, and meat. We waited another 5 minutes for someone to come finish the remainder of the lettuce, tomatoe, etc. by this time my husbands tortilla was getting cold and the Nina quesadilla forgotten. When I paid I had to remind the cashier twice we ordered a quesadilla, standing waiting another 2 min. 
My husband and I eat at Cafe Rio st least once a week. We love your food. This service was by for the worst we have ever had at any location. We will not be back to this location in the future."}
{"text":"Very delicious pulled chicken tacos. The rice was undercooked, but the tacos are so good. It's my new fave taco place."}
{"text":"I usually love love love this place and had to just throw my lunch because there had to be a quart of salt in the red sauce.  It was really horrible. I will stick to items without the sauce from now on."}
{"text":"Excellent pork.  My whole family loves this place.  Wife gets a salad, I love their burritos.  And they have free cheese tortillas for the kids when you find in.  Their pork is the best I've ever had, very sweet!  We come here often!"}
{"text":"2.4/5  - How can you make Mexican food without any flavor?

Ordered the BBQ pork burrito. Heard a lot about and read a lot of great reviews about this amazing BBQ pork. Turns out it is shredded pork with a very bland ketchup/honey sauce on it. I understand it's a chain and you aren't going to smoke the pork or anything that would add flavor during the cooking process but to skimp out and get the cheapest tasting BBQ sauce? Why even try? The other meat choices are shredded beef, shredded chicken, steak, and grilled chicken. The shredded beef didn't look too bad but the shredded chicken was sitting in a bunch of grey water and looked like it came out of a tuna can. 

The employees screwed up my order a little bit, but I forgive them due to the environment they have to work in. When someone orders extra meat or cheese they all have to scream \"extra meat\" or \"macho man\" or something else incredibly obnoxious that I couldn't understand. You can see by their face they are miserable doing it and I don't understand who they are doing it for. Does a customer exist who takes great pride in everyone within earshot knowing the standard is just not enough for them? If the owner or manager of the restaurant is reading this review, KNOCK IT OFF! It's not funny, clever, or whatever else you think it is. 

If you are looking for better quality Mexican food in the same price range first go to Baja Fresh (or Una Mas in the Bay Area), then Qdoba, then Chipotle.  On the way back I thought about whether there is any reason I would ever go back. The only thing I could come up with is if you really want BBQ and your wife really wants Mexican and you want to be nice and compromise and get a really crappy BBQ Burrito then maybe you go here."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio - the service at this location was extremely laid back. Visited after the lunch rush, so the employees might have been slowing down since no one was in line behind me. Employees did not look happy - but the food was really good!"}
{"text":"Came again on a Tuesday but I swear the sign today said that the tacos were $1.95. I opted for a burrito and was fairly underwhelmed. I got the beef which was good, but when I got it enchilada style I asked for mild sauce, not knowing it was green. My fault I guess. You know when you get mild and it ends up having a little spice? Not here. Mild = tasteless. if there is a next time, I'll have to get the medium or something hotter.

The people behind the counter scream things to one another and then they all repeat...I think it's supposed to be entertaining but it's obnoxious. Maybe I'm just yelping while grumpy..."}
{"text":"It's great for a quick lunch. The tortillas are made on premises, I can always appreciate fresh tortillas.  It is not authentic Mexican food by any means but it was good!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is by far my favorite fast food Mexican restaurant. I live in Northern California where there are no Cafe Rio's. I always make sure to stop here at least once!! I'm on a keto diet and they have menu items to accommodate that! Their salads are my favorite. 

They make the food in front of you and you have your choice of toppings so you can customize it any way you would like. 

Be sure to look out for the daily specials. Their shrimp tacos are to die for... I'm not positive but it may be Tuesday's. I've tried everything but their enchiladas and have not been disappointed. 

They have horchata, hibiscus lemonade, regular lemonade and a mint lemonade. They also have soft serve drinks available. 

They have punch cards and an app where you can earn points so be sure to ask for the info on those if you live near one!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty. Ordered a burrito enchilada style and it was a huge serving for what I paid. The food was great but service overall was ok. Our food was made to order quickly but something was holding up the checkout process. Their only vegetarian option was simply doubling the amount of rice and beans in the burrito so for a vegetarian I would not recommend this place as a first stop."}
{"text":"Food is amazing (5/5), but the staff & service are horrible (1/5 - some of the worst I've ever experienced). 

I'm a Cafe Rio addict, and I fell in love with Cafe Rio food a long, long time ago. This is the only Phoenix location that's remotely close to us, so this is where we usually go. I really wish we had a different one nearby, because I'd never set foot in here again, if it were an option. Unfortunately, the cravings for Cafe Rio food live on, and I always end up venturing back, and hoping that the service here will be better than it was last time (it isn't). 

Food: The food here is great, when they get your order right. Cafe Rio is much more flavorful and saucy than Chipotle-type joints, and I like their dressings and sauces better than Costa Vida's. Their salad dressing is unreal (the creamy tomatillo, don't bother with the cilantro lime). I would recommend the salad (huge, and definitely the best bang for your buck), tacos, and enchiladas. The burrito is good, and I'm happy that they no longer charge extra for enchilada style, but it always has a little too much rice in it (and not enough flavor) for me. The quesadillas and nachos are pretty greasy. The tostada seems like a good deal, until you realize that if you want guac, it's cheaper to just get the salad, which comes with it. Both desserts are phenomenal, and worth the $4-5!! The chips often taste old.

Tip: Don't order anything with the medium enchilada sauce (burritos & enchiladas) - it has the look and consistency of baby poop. The hot and mild are both good choices! I've had all three.

Service: The workers here always seem confused, as if they don't know what they're doing or how to put the food together, and I've had multiple orders ruined because they put things on that I don't like, or am allergic to. When I tell them that they've gotten my order wrong, they never offer to make me a new one, or make amends in any way, even if it has to do with an allergy. Every other Cafe Rio I've been to has been really good at this, so it's not a company-wide policy, or anything like that. As other reviewers have noted, even if you tell the employees what you want ahead of time, you will have to answer inane questions about everything, step by step. (\"No chips, please.\" \"Okay, chips?\") 

To-go orders are never ready on time, and every to-go order I've gotten has had some sort of mistake (wrong dressing, missing dessert, etc). 

It's worth noting that I've heard amazing things about the lunch crew here, and how they're efficient, friendly and helpful. I've never been able to come for lunch, so I can't comment on that, but just FYI!

To sum it up, I can't reasonably give this place 1 star, because I will honestly be back, since I love Cafe Rio food, but it'll be a while. I'm so frustrated with the service here, and I don't understand why it never gets better, even after multiple complaints from myself and others."}
{"text":"Just save yourself that time and money and go to Chipotle! The service here was so bad and the food was, at best, mediocre. The salsa lacked in flavor and the rice was painfully undercooked. We dined in and not once did anyone come out a clean off the tables. This establishment is a dump and I would be ok with never setting foot in this place ever again."}
{"text":"Just no, manager would not speak with me refused to see me when I had an issue. Don't like when people act like your unimportant."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Mexican food so I ordered what I thought to be the \"safest\" choice on the menu- the sweet pork tacos. I would have ordere the grilled steak or chicken but I don't want to pay the extra $1. I ordrered 1 sweet pork taco meal that came with rice and beans. I thought that paying $7 for a meal with no drinks is pretty steep. Overall, I paid $8.50 for my food and drink. The pork was pretty good- it lives up to its name- \"sweet\" indeed. For all you guys out there who like your meat savory, order something else. 

Also, I felt rushed when ordering. It seems like the staff wanted their line to move as fast as possible. I felt that  giving me 3-5 seconds to decide on what I want in my taco was a great inconvenience. Overall, the sweet pork taco was good and the service was mediocre."}
{"text":"My family and I love the food here but the service is really slow! We waited in line for 30 min to place our order. The teenage kids working behind the counter are either rude or pretending to work. This place could be really awesome if they had some competent workers behind the counter. The tortillas are fresh and the burritos are amazing. Just be prepared to wait a long time and be treated like crap"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good overall. The service was adequate, though they were listening to some rap music in the back that disturbed the music overhead. Just came off as unprofessional, which is why I gave the four stars and not five."}
{"text":"Would've given them two stars, but their flour tortillas were actually delicious so plus one star. I feel the food is a bit pricey for what they offer. We paid $29 for two orders, a side of beans and a large drink. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, but was served a shredded beef quesadilla. The quacamole was OKAY. Ordered by husband some tacos. The pinto beans were a little over seasoned for my taste. I can't understand why they do not have a SALSA bar. A mexican food place needs salsa! The highlight of my visit was the flour tortilla on my quesadilla, which reminded me of the ones grandma would make."}
{"text":"Had this for the first time tonight and it was really good! I had one shredded chicken taco and one grilled chicken taco, rice and pinto beans and loved it all. It all had great flavor. Would like more meat on the tacos, but they were still filling because the shells are thick. Hubby had pork burrito with mild enchilada sauce and LOVED it. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I loved this place.

Now I was first expecting a little resturant. When I went in, it was kind of like a chipotle, but better tortillas!!!

You have the tortilla makers, then the food prep, then the cashier. Our cashier was adorable! Loved her, I think her name was Chrystal. She was very sweet and made sure our order was right since it was our first time there. 



First bite was DELICIOUS!
will certainly be going again!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good, hence the three stars. However that is only part of any dining experience. The service is pretty bad. My wife and I were the only ones in line and it took us 8 minutes to get through. The guy behind the counter kept talking to a guy who had already completed his order. BTW, we have had slow experience at multiple locations. You guys should take a trip over to Chiplote's and learn how to run an efficient line."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. I come here often and the food is always hot and fresh. Sometimes they do try to move too fast but as long as you let them know exactly what you want ahead of time you'll be good.."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved eating here for the first time! It was wonderful walking in and seeing them make fresh tortillas while you wait in line. We stopped in for dinner. They have different items and you just select the type of meat. They have tostadas, burritos, tacos and salads. We all got burritos, I went with salmon. They have a vegetarian option which is just rice and beans. They offer enchilada style burritos at no extra cost. The burrito comes with a side of lettuce and pico. I asked for a side of their cilantro dressing which was amazing on top of my burrito. They don't offer a spicy salsa but they have a selection of hot sauces to choose from. 

We loved this place. The layout was really fun and casual. I'll defiantly eat here again when I am back in town."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch today.  The portions were HUGE and the toppings were plentiful!  I ordered a veggi burrito.  It was great!  The tortilla was freshly made and the toppings were fresh as well.  Service was quick but the place was super crowded and there wasn't enough seating.  I'm likely to return for dinner but probably not for lunch if I am in a hurry."}
{"text":"I will have to say I agree with some of the posts on here. I don't understand the bad reviews. The food is really good. Salsas are all amazing and I love how everything is fresh.
I would definitely come here instead of Chipotle.  The setup is similar and the staff are friendly. They let us try a sample of the meat to make sure it was what we wanted.
Horchata is great......and I'm picky with the Horchata. 
My only downfall was the amount of grease that dripped off my quesadilla. But don't get me wrong...the quesadilla was awesome. 
I think we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but if you like imitations mascaraing as authentic this may be your favorite spot. What is most interesting to me is not the food, it's the other patrons. If you are people watcher THIS IS THE MAIN REASON TO COME HERE. There majority of their clientele have something just a little bit different about them. It's pretty creepy, and very entertaining. 

If it's between this spot and Taco Bell, come here... unless you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Not my first trip into the Rio world, but despite a pretty inexperienced and fresh faced staff, the food was still solid as usual. At $7.99 for a burrito that can last two meals it is well worth the price. I always get my salsa on the side and I like the pico, the hot green sauce (better in the frig) and the medium cold salsa. They throw cheese on top now for free so that was an easy addition and the silverware and napkin area is a great place to stock your own kitchen. They have daily specials, but apparently the only thing special is you get a free soda, but no price cut. I used to upgrade to the grilled chicken, but the stewed version is better most of the times. Tortillas are still made fresh too, so this is a good chain."}
{"text":"Expensive and I was told there would be an extra charge for salsa if needed for chips even though the salsa I did get was for my tacos (unless you're supposed to eat your tacos without any salsa on them??). First time I came here cashier was snippy and obviously didn't want to be there. This was my second time there since I figured I'd give them another try. I think I'll stick to Chipotle where the prices are reasonable, you can get salsa if needed or any other option such as beans, corn, etc. (without being charged extra), and the employees are friendlier."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio! I've been obsessed since their original location opened in my hometown in Utah. Fresh tortillas, their delicious tomatillo ranch and fountain vanilla coke. What more could I ask for?"}
{"text":"Gave it another try and I am already regretting it! 

They do not listen, they go 100 miles an hour....shredded lettuce is no sheared lettuce at all...Pieces are so not nicely chopped ... 

Instead of chicken quesodilla my boyfriend got open quesodilla. He was not happy. 

Please slow down - at least when it is not so busy and listen to your customer."}
{"text":"I was very excited to come here and enjoy my lunch as I've been to another location a couple of times and really enjoyed my meal. My experience at this location was far from that. Customer service was completely absent-no greeting upon walking in, waited in line a lot longer than we should've, weren't asked if we needed drinks with our meal. The meal in itself wasn't put together well and tasted off. I won't be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"First visit... incredible food, fast friendly service and wow... a lot of food for a great price. My new place to enjoy Mexican Grilled food."}
{"text":"Enchilada style burrito with the fire grilled chicken was amazing! First time here and definitely be visiting again. Very fresh food and great drink options."}
{"text":"While the food is delicious, the staff is extremely rude and disrespectful and clearly don't want to be working there. In addition, there is always a line that doesn't move quickly. I decided to order online ahead of time and give a good 45 minutes. Both times I showed up and waited an additional 40 minutes just for my online order. They had no organization and there was a line out the door for the phone/online orders. It's not worth the hassle or time. Going to try another location to see if it's any better"}
{"text":"I'm absolutely in love with Cafe Rio! their Sweet pulled pork salads is the best thing on the menu. Every time I go to this location I get a warm welcome and a great meal. The service is good too even in rushes it still doesn't take a long time to get your meal. My favorite worker at this Location is Cici she's funny, kind, and always hooks it up with the Guac. I seriously go 2-3 times a week to get a meal and say hi to her. Also 1.95$ tacos on Tuesday are always fire. Seriously if you want a bomb meal go to cafe Rio"}
{"text":"I've been to this cafe rio a few times now and i always get the same salad. Its a good salad but everytime i go in the employees look miserable and rarely very nice. The salad itself is good but way to expensive! I could go to the claim jumper across the street and get a much better salad for cheaper. All in all i wont be going back"}
{"text":"Good food but it takes FOREVER to order and get your food.  On average 20+ minutes unless you are lucky.  Warning: Don't try to get anything there around Dinner time on weekends.  You will be in line for about 40 min and if you order online to pickup, they don't work on your order until you get there.  Others there to pickup waited 30 min after arriving and some just ended up leaving.  Too bad because their sweet pork is really good too."}
{"text":"Went to Cafe Rio again today (Thursday at 4 PM) and the food was good, as usual, but there was a noticeable decline in service from our previous visits. The lone food line worker was clearly unhappy and would rush us for choices (even though we were one of about three customers in the entire place) and seemed annoyed when we asked for a kid quesadilla. 

The cashier was equally as unhappy to be here and didn't greet us or look at us while we rang up our order. A customer behind us asked a worker how their day was going and they said, \"I would rather be at home.\" Lol. Well, most people would rather be at home than work but if your job is customer service, that's what you signed up for. Take a deep breath, chill the heck out and start fresh tomorrow. 

The strawberry lemonade was out and all of the garbage cans overflowing. I like the food but workers this unhappy always make me wonder what's going on behind the scenes with management. Not sure that we will be back as often. See my previous review for the yummy salad that we always get. :-)"}
{"text":"Another nasty meal in Avonhell. Things were going well until about halfway through the chicken tostada salad when a giant piece of chicken skin was discovered. Luckily i did not eat this or possible choking would have occurred. The skin was tossed away, but the mental damage was done. Poor Avondale residents must endure crappy chains their whole life. I'm out of this town today."}
{"text":"Like most Arizonians, I love Mexican food! There are never too many Mexican Food places! Right? Well... not exactly. This one could fall off the face of the Earth and it wouldn't matter. In fact, we'd probably be better off. 

This was my first visit to a Cafe Rio. Normally if I have a bad experience somewhere, it's not so horrible that I wouldn't give it a 2nd chance. However, there is no way I'd try this place again. The dining room was dirty and obviously hadn't been straightened up all evening. I should have turned around and left upon seeing the 'serving bar' and 'kitchen'. Why, oh why, didn't I!!!??? 

The food serving bar was FILTHY! I mean, FIlTHY! And one of the workers took his dirty gloved hand and wiped the food from the board into the bin of food that they served from! By the time I got home with my food, I just threw it in the garbage. I was so grossed out. I opened it and it was so greasy. I took a couple of bites, and thinking about the filth, just threw it in the garbage. It was really gross.

Also, I asked for some hot salsa or hot sauce and he looked really miffed saying we have this.... pointing to something red. I said, fine, because I wanted to get out of there. When I got home and opened it, it was enchilada sauce! LOL! What?! Surely they have salsa or some kind of hot sauce there, right? I don't know. It doesn't matter. I'd NEVER go back to a Cafe Rio to find out."}
{"text":"This was my first trip to Cafe Rio. It was lunch time and the place was very busy. The servers on the cafeteria like line were helpful and answered all my questions. You could tell they were stressed by the big crowd. Normally, a large crowd is a good sign. Sadly, this was not the case. I ordered the chicken tacos. The chicken was so salty it was barely eatable. The tacos came with fresh tortillas, but they were too greasy to eat. The pico de gallo could have saved the day, but it was bland and lacked the necessary acid. The rice and black beans had no flavor. I'm very disappointed in Cafe Rio. I don't know if I will give this place another chance. The 2 stars are for the helpful staff."}
{"text":"Why would you say you open at 10:30, but then when I place my order at 10:35 you don't have half of the ingredients? After you ask me what you can get for me... very frustrated. You shouldn't have unlocked the doors if you were not properly prepared to make the items you list on your menu!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why I'm even giving two stars, history maybe? I've been coming to cafe Rio for years, I lived in St George Utah and went to Cafe Rio on a daily basis for lunch. I move back to Phoenix a few years back and was so excited when they opened a Cafe Rio here. They are pretty close to my house so a few times a week I would be here and in the beginning quality was good but slowly and surely it has become a place I might go to once a month in hopes that it has gotten better. Today might be my last day here, this place has really hit a low. Is there ever even a manager here? I'm sitting here and the place is dead! Yet there isn't a clean table in the entire place, something I've noticed my last few visits. nobody is doing anything. The strawberry lemonade and horchata I used to love are now completely watered down and no longer the yummy drinks I loved. The food is mediocre at best. This is sad. I think I'll just keep cafe Rio a special occasion thing for when I visit Utah. Here is to hoping st George cafe Rio is still what I remember"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I came here it was good.  I got exactly what I want, a vegetarian salad, and it was fine.  I go in another time and they want to charge me for putting green sauce over the rice and beans.  However, when I tell them I want a veggie salad, they give me a ton of extra rice and beans that I tell them I don't want.  How does that make sense?  When I was charged for the green sauce, I told them I have never been charged before and they respond by saying well, you should have been. No I'm sorry, or anything like that.  Sorry, not coming here again.  You people are inconsistent and charge whatever you'd like, whenever you'd like, so for the very same meal, I am either charged 10 and change or 11 and change.  No thanks!"}
{"text":"This place tops chipotle HANDS DOWN. If your in and you like sauces- there are a ton to choose from. Also- get their special sauce. I think it's a chipotle ranch. They charge 50 cents for a small side and a dollar for a large but trust me, it's worth it! The service has always been good- but let's be honest- this place is all about that GOOD FOOD."}
{"text":"Why is the medium enchilada sauce so darn sweet? Most unsatisfying \"Mexican\" meal. Flour tortillas were coated with dry flour. No likey."}
{"text":"Slowest cafe rio ever.  It's good. Still cafe rio but you'll wait an hour if the line is out the door. It's bad."}
{"text":"This place isn't that great. Their vegetables taste like they're old, and their meats don't taste they are cooked very well. 

The best thing about them is their free refills on specialty drinks like horchata. My wife, who loves this place, insists on going on a weekly basis. The thing that makes it worth going is it's horchata and MOD Pizza which happens to be right next to it."}
{"text":"First off I don't like their marketing for the bogo offer that has been circulating Facebook and other websites...it's for a salad or burrito only, not a quesadilla or tacos. The quesadilla uses the same tortilla as the burrito. Chipotle bogo offers are for any menu item, I don't understand why the bogo at cafe rio is just limited to 2 items. Secondly, I find their burritos contain very little meat, it's a lot of rice and other carbs and a lot of fancy dressings to cover the fact there is very little protein in this burrito. Third and finally, they charge extra for things like sour cream, dressing, and salsas, where at chipotle these side items are free. Until cafe rio makes some changes to their marketing and stops charging for little side items, I will stay away from cafe rio!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time today. The staff here works really hard! It was pretty amazing to see how they work. It's very impressive. The line was long and they had a sign that promoted their app. I downloaded it and tried to order while in line, but the app sucked and kept glitching out, so I ordered when it was my turn. I got a chicken burrito with habernero sauce, which was very tasty but not spicy enough for my taste. I like that FIRE! Overall it was a great lunch spot if you're on break from work. Quick and tasty without that fast food feel. Everything's fresh and it's cool to watch them work their magic."}
{"text":"Okay I always compare this place to Chipotle. Its kind of the same concept, but way more variety. All in all this place is great, but it does NOT feel as healthy as chipotle does ;) haha. What is great is the tortillas (freshly made and MUCH MUCH better), the beans, and the guac is different not better but delicious!

Tips on ordering, I love the sweet pork. its good in a burrito, in a salad etc. I know my friends like the green chile beef which is also good. You know what is great? The fact that they have taco tuesday for 1.50 tacos. Umm wow. you cant get the steak though, its not on the deal. but get one of everything if you can fit it in ya!

The tortillas are the best part. really."}
{"text":"Left produce sticker on the lines in my salad.  If that's overlooked how is the other produced prepared?"}
{"text":"This place is always so busy during the weekday lunch hours, so I definitely recommend placing an order ahead if you're in a rush. They offer a military discount and rewards program. I love the choices! Carne salad is my favorite. The tortillas are homemade excellence!"}
{"text":"Love it! 10x better and fresher than Chipotle. The ingredients are always really high quality. Download the app so you can get rewards. They add up pretty quickly on double and triple point days! I will be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"My family is obsessed with Cafe Rio and this is by far the best location. They are always nice and balance all of the different parts (mobile and in person orders) very well!"}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite place to eat in the entire world. If I was on death row a sweet pork burrito smothered in medium sauce would be my last meal. Go out of your way to try this place out. Everything is good on the menu and they have taco Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This review is for the Cafe Rio off McDowell.  Before you order, take a look at the speciality drink lids. It will gross you out. Any restaurant willing to leave equipment out that filthy in plain sight does not maintain a clean environment. This will be my last time visiting this location. Now, the location in downtown Phoenix is fantastic!  Just avoid this one like the plague or you might catch it!"}
{"text":"I think this location obviously has some kinks to work out but otherwise our meal here on opening day was nice. I'm a big fan of the location in Mesa and didn't like the food quite as much at this new store in Phoenix. I can't pinpoint it and I'm not sure where the difference was but my typically veggie salad just didn't have the same wow factor. Having said that, the customer service was great and all workers were extremely friendly. This goes for both locations but I take issue with places that charge extra for something like sour cream. Overall an OK experience, will return after they've ironed out some issues."}
{"text":"The tortillas are fresh and made in front of you. ... such a change from what passes as a tortilla on the east coast.  This takes the baja fresh experience up a level. The pork is very good though a bit on the sweet side. Standard taco was served with lettuce tomatoes and pico. Rice and black beans accompanied the meal. Drinks are mostly soft drinks, though they serve house made limeade as well. The biggest downside of the location is the high ceiling industrial look, which combined with the loud music and the tile floors makes it impossible to carry on a conversation."}
{"text":"Love the concept here.  It reminds me of Chipotle but dare I say, better??  They make their own tortillas which are super warm when you get them.  I ordered the taco salad and it was extremely good.  It lasts me 2 meals which is great if you are on a budget.  I have only tried their chicken and it is very tasty.  Def will be back to try their other meats!"}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars and 2 thumbs up! So, good and fresh! Tried both the hibiscus limeade and mint limeade along with our steak burrito and an enchilada style sweet pork barbacoa burrito. Today was our first time here and it's awesome! We will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Good solid okay.  One thing is that it is a Subway like choose what you want as you go down the line. Tjis is fine but it is so loud in there it is very hsrd to communicate what you want."}
{"text":"We tried to eat at this location again. HUGE mistake!!! Nothing has changed. Staff is rude, unfriendly and unwelcoming. They want to be out the door by closing time so they're power washing the kitchen as you eat!! People are just leaving with their food because of the noise. Super loud! All the fluorescent lights are on and they're cleaning around you. No aguas because they're dismantled (but unclean) when you walk in. No more meats available..and they've stopped cooking food for what seems like hours. Mind you this is 30 MINUTES before they close!! They act annoyed that you're there. Poor management!! Just go to Chipotle or chick fil a down the street. Better food, friendlier management and staff. Corporate needs to step in at this location because there is clearly a problem here."}
{"text":"Food is always incredible. My company ordered a big lunch from this location today, and I was told off by their catering coordinator, Jessica, for having more than 10 entrees on my order and was told I was single handedly responsible for them having a line to the door through their lunch rush. She informed me that their location is incapable of running orders larger than 10 entrees and to use catering in the future. That's not what we wanted to do, I even called ahead and asked for earlier order delivery if possible, but if not, that's okay too.  Doesn't make me want to bring our company's business back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is way better than the reviews left. It is high quality and big portions. The burrito could feed 2 people. My favorite place to get a burrito."}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place and finally did. The atmosphere and aromas were telling me it was the right choice. As you walk into the line, you can see that the tortillas were being made fresh. Big plus! 

I ordered the burrito with the chile roast beef, black beans, rice and medium sauce. Then decided to make it enchilada style with the hot sauce. It was a huge portion. I also ordered a mint limeade. 

The burrito was good but way more rice and beans than meat. The red (hot) sauce on top also had a sweet component I wasn't fond of. The limeade was refreshing. 

Overall, I enjoyed it and live really close so I will definitely be back. I feel like there is a flavor combination that will really seal the deal for me. I just have to go back til I find it!"}
{"text":"I'm glad that Cafe Rio Mexican Grill opened up in Town and Country.  We have been to Cafe Rio a couple of times now.  On Tuesday they have tacos for $1.50.  Cafe Rio is now my favorite place for tacos.  The beef and pork tacos are the best.  If you are looking for a good taco you should check out Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Not worthwhile! 

I used to go to Cafe Rio restaurants all the time when I was in Utah and I only had good memories of my experiences there. 

This restaurant is a bit different. I didn't feel the service was adequate. Passable at best.  

I had the salad. It was fresh and the ingredients were also fresh for the most part...except for the tortilla bowl - it tasted like it was made a week ago. 

With all the competition in fast food, and with Chipotle practically across the street from here (0.5 mile West on Camelback) there's no reason for me to ever come back here."}
{"text":"A friend of mine raved about the salads at this place and took me to a Vegas location for my fist dining experience. I quickly joined the fan club, and was very excited to find a Cafe Rio near my Avondale hotel. 

You order at the counter from a menu offering salads, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas, quesadillas, nachos, and soup. The best part is that they hand make their own soft flour and multi grain tortillas! I was able to watch a woman make them while I ordered. I always opt for the salad with a large soft flour tortilla draped in the bottom of the bowl. Toppings include a choice of meats, beans and rice, fresh pico, cheese, cilantro, strips of tortilla chips, sour cream, guacamole, and limes. I love the creamy tomatilla dressing, it's almost ranch like! So good! 

The salads are served as a very large portion for just under $9. For a smaller, slightly less expensive option, I have ordered the tostada, which comes in the smaller bowl with a smaller tortilla in the bottom. They run the tortilla, and rice and beans through the oven really quick, but the tortilla remains soft and fresh, and you're able to add all the same toppings the salads have. 

Cafe Rio does not have any locations where I live, but I now find myself going out of my way to eat there when I find one in the city I'm visiting. I have only tried the salads, but the fresh tortillas, toppings, and dressing is enough to keep me coming back and leaving happy!"}
{"text":"What a fun place to eat! Great decor!!! I had nachos and they were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious. This space used to be a Baja Fresh, totally blows them out of the water. I would recommend this place to anyone, and I do. COME HERE!! IT'S GREAT FOOD!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the pulled pork or chicken salad at Cafe Rio. It is layered with so much goodness. First, a homemade tortilla with melted cheese then loaded with rice, beans, meat of your choice, lettuce, pico de gallo, queso fresco, guacamole, tortilla strips, cilantro and fresh limes. Topped with their house Tomatillo Ranch. Trust me guys, if you are a ranch lover like me, it is to die for, especially when you dip your tortilla in it! It is safe to say that I am a regular here!"}
{"text":"Food is fresh and made quick to order! David is my fav person ever, he is friendly and awesome!"}
{"text":"I have been a Cafe Rio lover since the first time I had a salad there in SLC, Utah. We usually frequent the Gilbert/Baseline location and were thrilled when they opened San Tan since it's closer to our house. The food was just as good as always- I love the beef barbacoa salad and my husband loves the steak burrito. Portions are large, so sometimes we share. The queso is to die for, and we love that they give free \"nino quesadillas\" for young children. My 2 year old eats every bite and I don't have to be upset later that I spent money on a kids meal that went uneaten. Taco Tuesday is the best- and I still leave completely stuffed after just one taco.  Now, beware- this location gets CRAZY busy with the white shirt and tie crowd coming in from the Gilbert LDS temple around the corner. It's often difficult to find a table and the line can be long.  I would definitely recommend to them that they not allow seating until you have your food in hand, as there are always huge parties taking up several tables pushed together that sit around and chat when they haven't ordered yet. Otherwise this is a spot we will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times. The food is okay. The staff is terrible! I haven't seen one person that looks pleasant working there. They don't even care what you ask for they will throw it on. If you tell them you don't want something they get completely annoyed. I hope the manager sees these reviews and tries to make positive changes around there. Why do they only have one cashier?! It's usually one that has no idea what they are doing either."}
{"text":"Normally I enjoy a \"cheat meal\" at café Rio, however tonight I had a very different experience. First it was very disappointing that they did not have steak available, at all... Usually if they are out of grilled chicken or steak they allow you to wait for them to cook some up, but not tonight. Steak was not at all an option, something to do with not having someone available to cut the meat to grill it. I found this to be strange at 7pm. I can imagine at the end of the night you might run out of options so that you do not have excess waste, but I would think at 7pm they would still be able to offer all the meats. Anyway I opted for something new, the shredded beef which was okay. Once I got home to enjoy my salad I realized that the tortilla was all crusty and hard and smelled like buttery popcorn. I am guessing it had been sitting for quite some time. Their tortillas are the normally the BEST part of the meal, made fresh and soft and lightly buttered. I would definitely say that the quality tonight was not good and for sure was not worth my cheat meal for the week :( If this is the quality that I get next time, it may be my last visit which is unfortunate because I usually really enjoy it..."}
{"text":"We've eaten here three times. The first time was pretty good. But the last two times we both got sick. 
The place is dirty and the crappy music is too loud. 
The workers don't listen either. You tell them you only want a little rice, they give you a lot. 
Won't be going back anymore."}
{"text":"Not worth their taco Tuesday. For every little thing you add, like pico de gallo or hot sauce is $1. And they only put like 2-3 little pieces of meat in your taco. Food is good but too pricey for a taco this cheap."}
{"text":"Good food. Horrible service.

Went on Saturday. The employees walked back and forth in front of us without saying anything. They were laughing and talking to each other but didn't even greet us. She looked mad when she asked what we wanted. Didn't say anything just slid the plate down. Then stopped getting our food to laugh with another employee.

The restaurant was dirty. Tables were not wiped off and there was garbage on the floor.

I had the barbacoa enchiladas. They were really good. The meat was a little sweet but I really liked it. I think it would be delicious as a casadilla. 

Not sure I would return."}
{"text":"My friends love this place & I Don't understand why?? Meat is bland, tacos are always soggy, only good thing I've had here is the nachos!! Pricey too!"}
{"text":"I would say this place is the best in its catagory.  Fresh tortias, fresh meat, nice options and the price is resonable.  Try the nice selection of refreshing mexicanish fountain drinks.  Don't forget a tres leches for dessert."}
{"text":"Horrible service. As soon as I seen cafe rio I couldn't wait to eat there. I haven't had it for about two years. I went in no one in line and waited for about 7 minutes with no one waiting on me. So I walked out.   I will not be back to this location. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Normally I would give Cafe Rio 4 stars. I like their steak burritos (enchilada style) and the queso dip is tasty. I was sad, though, that they got my online order wrong. I absolutely do not like rice in my burrito. They missed that detail/request. If you place a to go order make sure to check it before you leave the store. My burrito excitement was quickly deflated as soon as I cut into the burrito and I saw rice fall out."}
{"text":"Second time here and the food is excellent . Had the fire roasted burrito and the Pork salad. Plenty of food and it all tasted great. Will be back"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on the service i received. The food was average and what you would expect from any Cafe Rio location. However, the customer service at this location is horrific. The staff is incoherent, and needs  to work on active listening. It was clear i was not the only unsatisfied customer in line, everyone seemed to have trouble placing there order. This is the conversation i had with one of the employees.

\"Would you like pico on this\"

No thank you

*employee continues to put pico on the taco*

I dont want any pico

\"Oh ok\"

*ignores what i am saying and passes the order along to the cashier and goes to the next customer in line*

 The staff consistently messed up orders, and had a very unwelcoming demeanor. As someone who works in the customer service industry i tend to be more tolerant as i do understand what it is like to deal with difficult customers, however, there is no excuse for what i witnessed at this location. I can honestly say after this experience i will never be dining at this establishment again. Yelpers beware, save yourself from a lousy experience and just go to the chipotle across the street. They have better food at a lower price and much better customer service."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of positive reviews about this place so today I decided to go. What can I say? It's great. They have a pretty good variety menu and make their fresh crispy tortillas right informs of you. It's just like a chipotle like another customer said but a better variety and I do agree tastes better, you honestly can't compare or beat their amazing tortillas. Wishing I could give this place 4 1/2 stars. I just only wish they actually had Mexican desserts like churros or sopapilla but I they sadly don't. I still won't let that ruin my outlook because it's a good choice to make to go here. Stop here, not Chipotle!"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio because of the great burritos in the amazing TAsteE they put them in pie tins to make the burritos more like enchiladas. I think they soak the pork in soda so give it even better flavor."}
{"text":"I had been here a few times which were okay experiences but this last time was awful. The whole problem began when we were about to check out. I ordered a quesadilla and chips and queso, pretty simple right? Well even though she had just rung that up with the words queso in it she forgot to get it for me which was totally fine. So I remind her and she bring me some guacamole and cheese concoction so I just looked at her and said \"um queso?\" And then she finally got me the correct thing. This was understandable because everyone makes mistakes. Now my friend comes up to pay, she waits there for 3 minutes because the girl had to take a call for a to go order. Well another employee comes up to the register and instead of helping someone who has been waiting a while, she calls the manager over to clock out right in front of her. Well the manager then walks away instead of checking her out and she just waits for the girl to finish the Togo order. It look 5-7 minutes just to have her food rung in the computer. Then we sit down and the chicken was so dry, you could barely chew it. Also the \"homemade\" tortillas tasted like cardboard. I bring it up to the manager and let him know nicely. He says \"okay and what do you want me to do about it\" so I was extremely annoyed at this point. I said \"probably give us a refund since this entire experience has been horrible and the food is terrible, that sounds like a good idea to me\". So he gives us a refund and we leave. Definitely will only be going to the tempe location from now on!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst food!  Chicken enchilada was awful  tasteless chicken smothered in a salty crappy sauce. Husband and so had the pork. They said it tasted like the soaked it sugar. Rice undercooked. This place doesn't even deserve one star."}
{"text":"I went in for lunch from a lot of recommendations. The place smelled great and was busy with friendly people. They asked me what I wanted I said 2 steak tacos . They looked around and said there was non ready asked how long and they said they were not sure. How can you be out of steak and it's not even lunch . Well thanks for the effort"}
{"text":"This place is a mixed bag for me. I want to give this place 2.5 stars so since i cant ill go 3. It reminded me of a chipotle with a trendy dining room. I like chipotle and the flavor of the food was good. So that's a good thing...

The downside was the price. I had a steak burrito with a small drink for nearly $13... that's way to expensive.  Plus the burrito is 1/2 full of rice. I'm sorry but I can get a carne asada from a local taco shack with x2 the meat for 1/2 the price. 

So all in all decent food and very high prices. Will likely just take my business to somewhere I feel I get a better value."}
{"text":"The way you order is similar to Chipotle but the taste is not similar to chipotle. This place is just so good. I recommend a try. I always go for the fire grilled chicken salad with black beans and no rice with everything else on it. I love that this meal is cilantro and lime flavored. Their cilantro ranch is basically what makes the flavor. I order it this way because the entree is quite a lot. I would always share with my boyfriend because of how much it is and how full I'd get. Place is so worth a try. There's other options of meat and different ways you can have your food prepared."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is basically a clone of Chipotle. The place is clean, the service is mediocre, and the food is overpriced & bland.
The best item they have is the sweet pulled pork - the chicken has zero flavor. My issues with the service were thus: we arrived over an hour before closing and I ordered the pork burrito. They was about a 1/4 of a serving of pork left in the bin, and if I hadn't been watching that is all the kid would have put in my burrito. He scraped the bin to get every last bit for me, but it was still not even half the meat they should be using, so he offered to replace the remaining meat with chicken and I unwisely agreed. He didn't drain the soggy wet chicken at all - so the result was a burrito in a tinfoil pan that was basically a soup at the bottom. Forget about actually picking up the burrito to eat with your hands like anywhere else, you had to use fork and knife, and could have switched to a spoon by the end. It was pretty disgusting - all that wet tortilla and soggy meats. On top of that, the chicken had zero flavor, not even salt seasoning taste. The pork was flavorful, but I only got the tiniest hint of it, maybe two bites. The black beans were equally bland with zero flavor and no seasoning. I didn't mind the rice however, and was glad it wasn't the typical Spanish rice with nothing but cumin seasoning. But for $9, the rice isn't going to cut it when everything else was a major disappointment. The burrito was a total fail. My girlfriend got the pork tacos and thought they were good - she obviously chose wisely, and also got all the pork and left none for me! lol But to run out of your signature meat over an hour before closing? That's just bad kitchen management. Then on top of all that, I had a real craving for chips and queso - and they were offered on the menu and I ordered them. It wasn't until we were paying that we were informed that they do not have any chips and cannot fulfill our entire order. They couldn't say that earlier? They couldn't put up a note on the wall menu - out of chips! Common courtesy to your guests before they waste time standing in line and actually place an order. I did not want to dine there if we couldn't get the chips I wanted, we would have gone elsewhere - so it was pretty unethical of them to get me to the very end before letting me know I am not getting what I wanted to pay for. That is bad customer service, especially if you are expecting a guest to return. Now I don't want to ever go back there, whereas I probably would have if they told me \"no pork, no chips\" and we went elsewhere and took a rain check on Cafe Rio. It's only fair, and good business practice. The other thing that really bothered me, was while our food was being prepared one of the workers, I will assume the manager because he had a really arrogant attitude, was berating a younger worker for putting too much cheese on our food! he kept telling him to place less ingredients into our meal. Excuse me, please try to be a cheap bastard while the customer is NOT right in front of you! That is incredibly unprofessional and also showed how stingy this place is going to be every time. Basically the staff itself showed me that the food there is not a good value for the price you pay. 
I appreciate the concept of this place, and even making tortillas from scratch is great, but if you are going to cheat the customer out of proteins and cheese, have completely bland chicken and beans, not be able to competently put a proper burrito together, and not be honest about your menu - you aren't going to get any return business. 
Taco Senor is about 3 minutes away and blows this place out of the water with their tasty food, amazing prices, and terrific service. No comparison, go to Taco Senor instead of lame Cafe Rio. This place is for unsuspecting people with no taste buds."}
{"text":"Had a steak burrito and it was very good, meat was tender and flavorful! Did not have rice but had pinto and black beans and it was not dry!!! Much better than chipotle, staff was friendly and helpful so I'm coming back for sure!!! More than I could eat so I would say I got my money's worth!!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by stating how much I love cafe rio in general, their pork salad more specifically. I have been eating at the Gilbert/baseline location for the past 10 years. I was so pumped when this location opened because it is 2 minutes from my house. This location is just not as good. The food is always a little off the ideal temperature and flavor. I have put up with it because I still love the *idea* of cafe rio. When my husband wants espos, I always push for the rio and I win. However, the last time is tonight. For the third time in a row, an item of our carry out order was missing when we got home! This location needs help from corporate with the small details to make it a real cafe rio experience."}
{"text":"The food is great but we always, always have to make sure we get the right charge when paying for our food there. They charge more than we are supposed to pay, EVERY TIME. Today Saturday, 10/07/17 they charged my beans and cheese taco as a beans and cheese burrito and my husband's shrimp coco taco as a full meal. Because I know the trick already, I checked the bill before paying it. Staff isn't too friendly when I point out the error everytime it happens. The lines are always long there so they have to hold it back while they fix the error. Good food but make sure you check your bill ALWAYS before paying."}
{"text":"This place gets worse and worse every time I go... they ask for your what you want and keep asking for them only to forget to put the right stuff on.. They forget ingredients but want you to pay for the hole meal..."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio used to be one of my favorite places in town until last Saturday.  I have been going to Rio in UT for many years every time I go skiing there and when one opened in Phx I have been a very loyal and consistent customer.  I took my girlfriend there on Saturday the 25th for her first time and because of the awful service we received from the two males and one female working at 1pm she said it was the worst meal she has ever had.  To start off the staff was standing around, not acknowledging anyone and throwing everyone's food around like they were pissed off to be \"forced\" to be working there.  The staff didn't care about the quality of food they were serving so the tacos my girlfriend ordered were soaking wet to the point she couldn't eat them and my burrito looked like it was thrown down a flight of stairs.  I took a picture or my burrito because of how bad it looked.   The female threw pico at my burrito then threw the tray so hard down the line it folded the container. Everyone in line with us was getting the same treatment and everyone was talking about how poor the service was.  Also because the staff had no care whatsoever the food quality was also terrible and questioning me ever wanting to go spend my money there again.  

I wrote this same letter to Café Rio's corporate through their website and I haven't had one response letting me know that their employees probably act the way to go because the company doesn't care so why should they.  

Don't waste your time or money going to the Café Rio in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"This place was ok. Just ok. Chipotle ingredients have more flavor. Just because you pay more here doesn't mean the food is better than chipotle .  The food lacks flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place! Your food is crafted right in front of you,  and you have the choice of different types of meat.  You can also order your burrito enchilada style, and it's absolutely amazing!  The only draw back was the price,  expect to pay about $11 for a burrito and a drink.  However the burritos are huge and could easily be eaten in two meals,  or shared."}
{"text":"1st time here. Homemade flour tortillas , big portions and great price. Service was fast and great. Definitely large portions."}
{"text":"Understaffed on a Friday night. Waited in line 30 min. They were out of the deal of the day and out of corn tortillas and out of horchata. The tables and floor were a mess."}
{"text":"Decent food, gargantuan sized salads in this chipotle type semi fast food place. Although there were 7 people behind the serving line/kitchen  only 1 of them was actually working on orders so it's a bit slow. Good selection of drinks at the self serve bar."}
{"text":"Half off a burrito or salad.....does it get any better than that? Well, free would probably beat it, but this was a great deal. I installed their app many months ago, and they send you some pretty good deals. I went in to grab a salad....by the way, it's not your typical salad. This thing leaves you really full. It's almost like an open burrito. 

Everyone was nice and courteous. The people on the line would be awesome if they spoke a little slower and a little louder. It's hard to understand them sometimes. Regardless, great experience and great food. Can't wait for my next coupon!"}
{"text":"Setup like subway, but Mexican food.  Average food. Average selection.  Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"More like a 3.5/5 but first...let me explain. My buddy took me here on a whim and I had never heard of the place despite there being a lot of locations around The Valley now, so I had to check it out. Being a veteran of getting food sick at Chipotle on more than one occasion I'm always looking for a new cafeteria style replacement. There are a lot more things to choose from here compared to that of similar companies, aside from the additional preparation styles I.e. Taco, burrito, etc. they have what seemed like more meats to choose from and better tasting than that of chipotle as well. The tortillas are a lot more fresh than Chipotle which I definitely can appreciate being a native Arizonan and the fresh tortillas definitely helped bring more flavor to it. And I can't forget to give them a giant shout out for having Kotija, you never see that at these kind of places. However...I can't let my experience go completely unscathed. Despite the delicious meat and toppings that went into my burrito, the prices were insanely high! It seemed like everything cost extra, we knew the Guac would be extra, but the sour cream cost extra too! Overall if I didn't have a promo coupon I would have paid over $10 for just the Burrito, no sides or drink. For me, good Mexican food doesn't need to cost more than $10 and so that would hold me back a lot from coming back in on a usual basis. Try it out though, see what you think, for me my local Taco Shops might still be the move."}
{"text":"What a great surprise, just around the corner from a closed Baja Fresh is Café Rio Mexican Grill 

There's no comparison to that former Wendy's Mexican food concept. Cafe Rio is the real deal. 

We came here for lunch and then, since we were working late we came back to grab something for dinner.  It's crazy good.  It also wasn't as packed, but the food was really good. 

As you enter, you'll see that standard Mexican cantina decor. Tin lights with punch holes (photo) in them. Bright, very bright painted tables and beautifully made iron stone plates hanging on the walls. All very familiar, but nicer than you've seen before in other places.

After a few visits now, I've ordered most item on the menu.  My favorite?  Their Burrito, Enchilada style ($7.99) with spicy sauce and cheese on top.  Yummy!.  They have that homemade press (photo) working non-stop.  The Burrito stretches to fit, since it's so fresh and the dough hasn't become hard.  Love it.

Their Tacos ($2.99) are also good, as is their Guacamole ($1.99).  But you have to try their Lime-aide drink.  It tastes like a virgin Mojito!  BYOB I guess. LOL

Now I realize this is a chain, and therefore it might not be for everyone, but... a lunch here for $10.00, is a nice alternative to that other place with the corrugated stainless steel fetish.  You know who I mean.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Cafe Rio franchise but this one is horrible. I've been in twice, since moving to the area and both times they disappointed me. This time was unacceptable though leaving me not able to finish my meal. 

I come in frequently to the Gilbert location because it's near my work,so I know what sides and extras come with meals. At this location you need to ask if you want ANYTHING. They try to rush you through the line, and if you ask for anything the workers roll their eyes and are inconvenienced. 

I was ordering for my family and didn't notice the missing items until I got back to my house. I did catch one thing in line. I ordered two tacos, and instead of asking if I wanted pico, she just started wrapping the tacos up. I asked for pico and she rolled her eyes and that's when I noticed the container was empty! She didn't want to walk back and get a new one! So instead she just decided I wasn't going to get any. I insisted and she went back and got me some. 

I get home, with my tortilla soup, missing half the ingredients, and my two tacos and two tosadas. I take a bite from my taco, and pull a foot long black hair out of my mouth. Needless to say I didn't finish my meal, which brings their cleanliness into question considering when I was getting my beverage, the brewed tea dispensers were open to the world. Disgusting. 

Management obviously needs to step it up at this location because if it's happening to me it's happening to others. And, after reading the reviews my complaints are the same as others and not being addressed."}
{"text":"My office ordered tons of food from this location, and mine was the one order that got lost in the shuffle. No biggie, it was a huge order! They said they'd either remake it or refund me, so I asked them to remake it, and I came in to eat. Food was great (chicken tacos, black beans, and rice), and the manager gave me a free trés leches cake for my trouble. Great customer service! The store was clean and workers seemed nice. I will return. :-)"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!

I mostly go for the salmon taco special on Fridays.  Can't beat the price for ALL FRESH ingredients.  Price is $10.00 for 2 salmon tacos, rice and beans and a soda (combo meal price).  Everything is always fresh and tastes awesome."}
{"text":"Positives: The sweet pork barbacoa is fantastic. The food is overall really good at Cafe Rio, and my wife and I come here probably at least once every three months because we live right down the street and we're always driving by. 

Negatives: They are a little weird in the way they go about the ordering process. Their staff has been pretty rude at times and they have messed up my order more than once. 

Overall, I'll still come back here because it's cheap and I love that pork."}
{"text":"Finally, a decent Mexican fast casual place.  Cafe Rio has made its way up north to Scottsdale!

I've been eating in the Cafe Rio in Chandler for over a year and have become very impressed with consistently high quality offerings. The food is really, really good and worth the $10 I normally pay. 

We decided to check out their new location here in the north valley. The focus of Cafe Rio is \"freshness\". It sort of reminds me of that former McDonald's owned concept that begins with a C. The one with the industrial heavy metal and wood fetish. LOL

Here, you have brightly painted tables and chairs, along with festive decorated walls. But we don't go out to admire a restaurant's decorations, we go for the food and Cafe Rio delivers. 

We ordered tonight the Shredded Pork Salad ($8.49), Grilled Steak Burritto ($9.49) wet Enchilada style (photos) and a side of Guacamole and Chips (4.99); with the bill before taxes coming to $25.16. Everything was great and yes we'll be back.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fun and tasty! We stopped in at Cafe Rio Mexican Grill (odd name, great food) and were very satisfied with the food, the service and the general atmosphere of the restaurant. The staff was very attentive, clearly motivated to do a good job with the new restaurant and it is a bright and cheerful place, fun to visit. I had the enchilada which had a good amount of very fresh chicken, the sauce was very good, just right on spiciness, and the pinto beans and Mexican rice were as good as any I've had. Definitely on my list for return visits to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"Food is great here, but the management in this place is horrible. I have been here 3x, and 3x I have been overcharged at the register.. 3 out of 3. Place is always very dirty even when slow. Time for some new management?"}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with Cafe Rio - consistently good food at a reasonable price!  We stopped in with my parents again (after checking out the Flagstaff location) to enjoy the sweet pork barbacoa enchiladas and burrito.  We enjoyed everything about our meal - the meat, the rice, the beans and the amazing drinks too (check out the flavored lemonades and limeades...so good!)."}
{"text":"This place has the most Ridiculously slow service. Stood inline for over half hour......won't do it again"}
{"text":"The food isn't very fresh and is overpriced.  The menu is very similar to Costa Vida but Costa Vida is a lot more fresh and the customer service is much better.  I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm a dual citizen and have lived in both Mexico & the U.S. so feel I'm qualified to say Yolanda's pork tamales are the BEST I've had in a restaurant! This isn't a fancy place & no liquor license, so if you need Mexican beer with your meal, get the take out & take your food home. The staff even sings! I always give a Cinco de Mayo party (not a big holiday in Mexico but good excuse for a party in May!) and this year I'm ordering dozens of tamales from the Cafe Rio!  PLUS, I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"100x better than chipotle or the like. Tortillas are made fresh, everything tastes fresh and flavorful. I had the burrito made enchilada style with hot sauce and cheese, baked. Few downsides - it's a little pricier than competitors, the salt level is on the high side for the meat, and some of the staff can be rude. But it's totally worth it for the food that you get."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to get a burrito. The portion sizes are huge and are perfect for sharing or leftovers. The restraunt is alwayd clean and they have a super friendly staff. I would definitly reccomend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"This place is what chipotle would like to grow up to be. Everything isvfresh, fast and however you want it. I love that they will put anything on anything that you want! I like some enchilada sauce on my nachos thank you, and they put it on for me! Getting a salad but don't want the big hunks of lettuce they use? Ask for the shredded lettuce, you'll get it. I like that you can customize your order because I'm a custom orderer. The prices are great for the huge amount of food you get and the staff is always pleasant. It dies get loud inside but that's because it's a  popular, casual place. I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"Omg this is the best Mexican food ever.  Everything is fresh and not frozen.  I don't understand why everyone on here doesn't love this place.  Best ever!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered a cheese quesadilla. Just cheese, no meat, veggies etc and it cost $8.25. Seriously? Worse yet, it wasn't very big. I let my husband have most of it because it was so paltry with very little cheese. We also ordered chips n queso with two drinks for a total of $18. 

Their system of ordering similar to Chipotles, going down the line where different people put various ingredients in for you. Multiple people try to take your order, no one seems to know what the other is doing and the cashier always seems confused. 

We've been here a couple times since they opened. For me, the meat tastes very sweet and the process of ordering and paying is so convoluted that we've decided it's our last trip. We will go back to Chipotles who has this process down, has better customer service and it doesn't cost as much."}
{"text":"I do not understand the bad reviews from other Yelpers. This place is fantastic, yes I agree the staff behind the counter isn't always 100% on their game but non the less, food is always delicious. Not sure about you, but I go to a quick eat place like this b/c I'm hungry and want tasty food, not to get praised and smiled at by teenagers behind the counter. If you're still leery of the reviews, go in for Taco Tuesday- all their tacos are $2 so give it a go."}
{"text":"I am very happy to have come along with my sister and her husband to get some food at this Cafe Rio. The staff was friendly. The food was delicious and prices are reasonable for the portion served. The place was also cleaned and easy to locate. I definitely recommend this location to anyone looking for a nice place with great food.

{"text":"9 out of 10 my order is missing items or wrong. Items that I pay extra for AND items that normally come on the entree will be missing. WARNING unless you are dining in and can watch exactly how your items are being made, I would not go here."}
{"text":"They would not except to my coupon that was just a few days late. Smash Burger that's right next to him except coupons anytime. Plus I prefer coasta of Vida"}
{"text":"I would give the food 4-stars and the service 2-stars at best.  I've had a few bad experiences with the workers that left me shaking my head, but I still come here.  The salads are good and you can't go wrong with Taco Tuesdays.  Sweet pork is delicious in moderation but then becomes too sweet.  Love the cilantro ranch dressing.  All in all, I'd still recommend this place.  Hopefully they can improve on their service."}
{"text":"I lived by the first Cafe Rio ever (provo, ut)and have been eating there a couple times a week since.  I used drive to Gilbert on weekends to get my fix so I was so excited when they opened up by home.  The opening crew was energetic and refreshing at first but now the crew is cranky!  They act as though you are bothering them being there! 
I can't believe how much slower they are now without the originals there. 
I will give props to the Same great food and our sweet lady who works both in dining room as well as in the back... restocking the food! Hey name falling me now,  but she is the BEST! Her love and smile is the ONLY thing that makes me come back to this location. 

Please find a crew who represents your brand better... there is no love anymore"}
{"text":"Lets Keep this short and sweet:
Food = OUTSANDING A+
Customer service = B - (at best)
Facility cleanliness = A from what I could see
Nickel and diming you to death = they are true experts at.
To get your plate just the way you want it with all the \"EXTRAs\" plan on spending $12 per plate
Extras include:
Salsa on tacos
Cheese
Sour cream
Guacamole
Chips and salsa are nearly $5 (OUCH) (little baby cups of salsa too btw.)
The plate is a good size and the food is good but I left feeling like the opportunist of this business are exploiting their customers on a daily basis."}
{"text":"I came to this location because it's close to me but the place has really gone downhill since my first visit a few years ago. While I did enjoy my chicken burrito, the prices with a drink just don't make the visit worthwhile. The aguas frescas machines are always empty or near empty. So pickings are often slim for non soda drinkers. The line employees really don't pay attention to what you tell them. On more than one occasion they've gotten my order wrong, seconds after saying it. I don't complain about it because their procedure is to just throw the entire order in the garbage (wasteful). I'd recommend offering the customer a discount on the incorrect order instead of immediately wasting it. Watch out for the expensive side order of guacamole even if they're scraping the old brown left over. Dining in is a hit or miss, none of the employees seem to be responsible for cleaning the tables. I hope this place can get some better management. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the service. Came in at 9 and 5 employees were cleaning while only 1 person managed the line and register with 3 customers. (They close at 10). The workers cleaning were also cleaning the tubs that sit right next to the food with chemical products and were seen touching food areas with dirty rags and not changing gloves in between cleaning and handling food containers. Not cool."}
{"text":"Pork tacos are real good.  My wife likes the pork salad.  All tacos are quite good."}
{"text":"I've been to this Cafe Rio more times than I can count. The food is consistently good. The service can be hit or miss sometimes, but when we've had problems with the order, the manager has been nice enough to sort things out. The place can get busy for lunch, but is usually pretty slow during the evening hours. Just like any other Cafe Rio, their pulled pork is amazing and their prices are low.  They also have a great rewards system if you get their app."}
{"text":"I definitely got a sodium overdose at this place.  I got the chicken enchiladas which seemed like a good idea at the time.  The sauce and the salsa had so much salt in it. I could barely tell the taste of the dish.   The tortilla and chicken are fine, but I just couldn't get over how salty everything is. 

The sides were rice and black beans.  The beans good, but Just average. But probably I have this place a 2 star instead of 1. The rice was really hard. They definitely undercooked it. 

The tres leches dessert was actually not bad. It's a bit sweet, but not too much. Not like how the enchiladas were salty.  They even delivered it to our table even though this is a fast food place. 

Another note: it's set up like Chiptole stores, but the glass in front of the food preparers is a bit high. Found that I had to tippy toe so the guy could here me better."}
{"text":"Always a long line during the lunch hour(expect to wait 15-20min), but the food is always great!! Pulled pork salad is the way to go and never disappoints!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Cafe Rio!! & I'm so happy they finally built one in our area! This place is always busy & will remain to stay that way! I would recommend this place to everyone! Just beware.. They get SUPER busy @ lunch time! :) finding setting can be difficult :) but great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent for a fast food type place! We got the 2 enchiladas and split them both. The shredded beef was really tasty. Pork was good but a little too sweet for me. My son didn't like his taco. I didn't try it though. The chips were kind of stale and I didn't like the salsa. It was made from real tomatoes and onions etc but it just wasn't fresh and it was really dry. Yuck."}
{"text":"Probably the best taco Tuesday deal in all of phoenix. The workers have fun while they work, they're super nice. Lighting inside is pretty neat too. They have a patio area too. Food was great, I had the chicken tacos! They also have like 4 different types of limeades!"}
{"text":"It was my first time visit here! Their guacamole was so good. I ordered a bowl of salad. It was more than plenty. Very satisfied. :)"}
{"text":"Incredibly shocked by the staff at this place.  We walked in and there was a lady at the register but no cooks.  She saw us and went back to the kitchen to find someone and came back out still looking.  She never acknowledged us or mentioned that someone would be with us in a minute or anything.  We were about to leave until the manager walked out and began to prepare our meal.  

He did wash his hands and on gloves which we appreciated but then said little to nothing as he prepared the meal.  No apology for a wait or for no staff being there at all.  He just went down the line and very sloppily put our burritos together with no care.  When we got our meal there was salsa spilling off the side of the bowls and no care was taken making our dish.  We then asked if they had keys for their bathrooms as they were both locked but he snapped back telling us no and that obviously someone else was in there.  

We also noticed the place wasn't kept very clean.  The drink station was overly wet and sticky as if someone just dumped soda and ice all over the place.  The food prep station was humbled and had ingredients strewn about into other container like lettuce in salsa.  

I determined that the food is overly sweet at both locations I've been too so that just be their recipes.  We both got steak burritos enchilada style and while not terrible, the off sweetness is just off putting.  I want spicy Mexican food not sugary.  

I won't go back to this location at all.  Staff was rude and not attentive.  The manager (only staff not wearing a black t shirt) was very short with how he spoke to us and the other staff that eventually appeared were all joking around and goofing off when there was plenty of clean up that could've been done.  The food itself isn't terrible but something strange about it being so sweet.  I do appreciate that you can get things enchilada style where you can't do that at a chipotle or qdoba.  Considering there are plenty of restaurants in the same area, I would pass and find a better option.  2 stars and that's only because the food isn't inedible."}
{"text":"This place isn't very good. Thought I would try it since I go to Chipotle the majority of the time but it's not even close as good. Their food area is sloppy and their staff is not even helpful. I won't go back there."}
{"text":"Visited 1/26/17 Poor management and understaffing is driving this place into the ground, Showed up on time for my phone order, waited 20 minutes in line with only one other person in front of me, they didn't have all the food made, so waited 15 more minutes for that. I was charged wrong and shorted about $8 worth of food, it took another 10 minutes or so to correct that ( I got the food but didn't want to bother with the over charge, my meal was already cold).  With Costa Vida in the same parking lot, it just doesn't make sense to come here."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite for so many reasons. The food is awesome. I always like the two taco, pork plate and my husband loves the pork burrito, smothered in green sauce. You cant' go wrong with this place! And, they've been promoting their locations with BOGO offers. It can get very crowded at times, but I have found the line to move quickly."}
{"text":"Pretty typical Mexican fare. Reminds me of Chipotle. Came here for lunch, got the salad with Grilled chicken, which is basically an open faced burrito with lettuce. They make their tortillas fresh, right there at the counter. Although my salad came on a tortilla and it looked tasty, I didn't eat it because it looked like it had a lot of calories. The dining area and food prep areas looked clean from what I could see.

For the health conscious, I don't think they have anything that could be considered \"Healthy\" , even the salad likely has a ton of calories.

4 stars, I will return."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is decent but not worth the high prices, hassle or customer DIS-service. When this location opened a year and a half ago I went quite a few times, than slowly started going less and less until a few months ago when it finally became unbearable to go inside this place. Today I was craving a taco salad so I decided to give it one last try. My mind is fully made up that I will no longer go here.

First of all, I strongly suggest not to go between 11am and 2pm, especially if you work nearby and are on a quick lunch break. It WILL make you late to work! Parking is nearly impossible. Whomever designed the parking lot should be fired. Not only is it difficult to find a parking spot but it's terribly laid out making it difficult to get around.This place is is a small building surrounded by a Starbucks, a pizza place, sub shop, bakery and book store. The parking lot can accommodate enough cars for MAYBE 2 of these restaurants. I understand that this isn't Cafe Rio's fault, but it does have a very strong impact on your dining experience which is why I'm putting this information in this review.

Second, the line never has less than about 40 people and the employees are incredibly slow. These unfriendly employees work like an assembly line with only 3 people making the food. One person takes your order and puts together some of it, and then it's passed along to others to complete the order, kind of like at Subway but much slower. Also, there is only 1 cashier who also needs to get the to-go orders ready. So, when you get to the register to pay you need to wait for them to put on lids and bag everything up. I waited 30 minutes today for my salad and was late getting back to work. 

Third is regarding price. My salad was a pricey $8.49. It normally comes with many things that I do not like (cheese guacamole, etc) and therefore omit, thus saving the company money. Regardless, they still charged me an extra $1 for some extra dressing. So, for $9.49 I received a tortilla, a small amount of chicken, lettuce, black beans and some pico de gallo. By the time I added a drink my meal was over $13.00. 

For the amount of time I waited in line and for how much I spent, I could have gone next door to Arriba's (with table service), had a margarita and a meal in about the same time as it took me to get my salad at Cafe Rio. 

One last thing: You can order take-out orders over the phone or through their website however, each time I have tried these options it was a failure. The orders aren't ready when they say they're supposed to be ready and they're never right. The only way for the order to be correct is if you tell them what you want to their faces.

Sorry Rio. I won't be back and I mean it this time."}
{"text":"My partner and I eat here quite a bit. I am a vegetarian and this place has options on the menu for me. I have tried multiple times to really like this place for my partner. But they can never seem to get the vegetarian options quite right. They drop meat in the vegetarian green salsa and still claim it is vegetarian. Their grill where they melt cheese on the tortillas is never clean and meat is every where over it. We are no longer going to be visiting this location. They need to get their act together. Added bonus tonight is that the person checking out tonight was extremely rude."}
{"text":"Granted I have only been here twice, but I think they have the best Nachos in the West Valley. I have tried Nachos about everywhere and Cafe Rio is tops. I prefer Queso cheese rather than shredded, and Cafe Rio's is sooo goood. Shredded Beef, Queso Cheese dip, black beans, pico, then top them off with sour cream and guacamole. Shut The Front Door. It's that good. Huge portion so come extra hungry or ready to share."}
{"text":"It's been my experience a few times now that Cafe Rio hasn't ironed out their vegetarian routine yet. Their menu at the store says that quesadillas include sour cream and guacamole, and their meat options include \"vegetarian\", which is extra guacamole, rice and beans. Which makes it sound like you can either you order a no-meat quesadilla without being charged extra for the meat, or they charge the same price that they would charge if you'd ordered meat, and give you extra guacamole, rice and beans instead. But I never seem to get those choices when I'm going through the line. Every time I go through, they're just completely confused by my choice and seem to want to charge me more or don't know how to ring it up.

Today, I ordered a vegetarian quesadilla and was given no meat, guacamole, and sour cream. I said I wanted to replace the meat with extra rice and beans and guacamole, and they told me it doesn't come with that option. I either get rice and beans or guacamole and sour cream. Guess we vegetarians aren't allowed to be more hungry than that. Asking for an extra side of rice and beans is $2, which is more than just ordering meat. 

Oh well.

Plus the food isn't that great."}
{"text":"I'm religious about Taco Tuesdays!  The barbacoa pork is one of my favorite things to eat, period.  I will occasionally go in and get a burrito, enchilada style which is great with the red sauce as it has a little spice that goes nicely with the sweetness of the pork.  I do not like their rice as they mix it with their green sauce.  I always ask for my pinto beans to be drained well because they will make your entire order soggy if you don't specifically ask for that from them.  I tend to go here about once a week and always enjoy it. 

Staff is up and down - I hear a lot of grumbling when I've been in the last few times (about their colleagues, bosses, schedules, etc.) which is not appropriate in front of customers in general.  The food is always great though and the staff have never been rude to me nor have they ever messed up my order - which is a MAJOR pet peeve of mine - so I love that.

Parking can really be horrible in the lot dedicated to this and several other restaurants."}
{"text":"Wow, Mexican food as good as I get in Vancouver.....

I have been trying to get my fill on Mexican food while here in AZ and got drawn in to Cafe Rio by their fresh homemade tortilla sign. It is kind of sad when the tortilla is the highlight of the meal. 

I ordered the Maria Enchilada with medium salsa and had pico de gallo on the side. It was so devoid of flavor, spice or heat that I would consider it the equivalent of Mexican baby food. There are so many other better places to go."}
{"text":"Love the sweet pork here!! Great service every time we go and food is always awesome. The salads are amazing."}
{"text":"This was my first, and probably last visit to Taco Rio. They did have excellent food, but the service was abysmal. The customers are rushed through, and made to feel unwelcome when asking any question. The restaraunt was in terrible shape: Trash all over the tables, the trash cans were full, there was no iced tea, there was no horchata, and out of four flavors to add to horchata, three bottles were empty. In the men's restroom, there were no paper towels. My wife reported there were none in the women's restroom either.  Obviously, the employees at this Taco Rio could care less about quality. I also did not like the way we were \"nickel and dimed\" for minor additional items (sour cream, dressing, etc.)."}
{"text":"This place is set up like Chipotle or Qdoba or any of those places. I ordered a burrito with sweet pork, enchilada style. The meat was very sweet, good, but maybe a bit too sweet. I'd try the steak or something else next time.

The rest of it - tortilla, sauce, rice, and cheese - were good but not great.

Overall, it was tasty, but I think I prefer Pancheros, then Chipotle, then Qdoba."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio doesn't reply to any concerns you email to them, so better to just post on Google and Yelp for all to see.  I used to live in Great Falls, MT. The Cafe Rio there is AMAZING.  Food was always fresh.  Service was wonderful.  The spirit of Cafe Rio was alive (\"FREE MEAL\" \"NACHO NACHO MAN\").  I ate there HUNDREDS of times.  Then I move to Arizona... Big mistake ever going to ANY of the Cafe Rio locations here.  Here was my most recent and LAST visit about a month ago at the location near Chandler Mall.  

I had a gift certificate (people know I love Cafe Rio... or used to) and went in to use it with a friend.  Ordered a salad.  I noticed the shell was already sitting out and ready to fill with lettuce; it's supposed warmed with cheese on the grill when you order.  I asked for a fresh shell because I like my shell warm and soft (they've pulled this crap on me at least 5x before, which I've never seen them do this in Montana).  Usually here in AZ they comply and make me a fresh one.. but this time she told me \"this one IS fresh\". I asked \"is it still warm, just off the grill?\".  She said, \"yes.\" So I figured she must have just made it right before I walked in.  Great.  Got further in the line and asked for Chips and Queso from another gal (aamaazingly delicious at Cafe Rio) and the lady told me \"we're all out of that for tonight\" but then turned to the back and screamed \"WE NEED MORE QUESO\" to whoever was behind her and then turned to me and said nothing. Didn't offer to have me wait for it. Just said nothing. Super awkward.  I was confused and thought maybe she was getting me Queso, but I would have to wait, but then the guy from the cash register had a bowl of chips ready and asked \"So do you still want Chips then?\" And I looked back at the girl to ask if I was getting Queso or not, but she was already gone.  So I turned to him and said \"Not if I'm not getting Queso\" and he dumped the chipped and sighed with poor body language.  Then he went to ring up the order.  We had a gift card of $15 I think.  The total was $16 or $1 more of whatever the gift card was.  My friend handed him a $5 bill and said \"for the difference\".  He looked very confused and paused.  Then accepted the full $5 and rang up the card for $11, gave it back and said \"here you still have $4 on your card\".   I told him that's not what we intended and he said he couldn't fix it and didn't apologize.  Then we went to sit down outside and eat, and I found the girl who told me \"no more Queso\" who was standing immediately outside the patio door making out with a guy leaning up against the glass window who I assume who was smoking right by the door because it smelled of it.... so we walked over to the front area to eat outside away from them and sat down underneath a recessed light that was installed above a fan, so the fan blades made the light flicker incessantly over our heads which was very annoying.  Then it got better... I took one bite of my salad shell and it was COLD and HARD. NOT fresh.  I immediately went back in to get a new shell.  I asked for a new fresh shell like they make for a salad with cheese on it and got yet more bad body language from the cashier. He didn't speak to me or apologize.  He heard me, walked back, and asked the first girl who told me the shell was fresh to make me a shell. She then glared at me. When I got a fresh shell I decided to ask her if there was Queso available and she said yes in a moment, but I just said \"oh just curious, I don't need any now\".  I should have just ordered it with my $4 gift card.  STUPID!!!!!!!!!!

On the way out, we gave someone else our $4 gift card who was just coming in.

Cafe Rio has some incredible food.  But I've had equally terrible experiences at ALL of the other locations here in AZ.  I just don't get it. One time I got a quesadilla with only meat in 1/4th of the sections (Gilbert location).  And I once got House Ranch inside my Quesadilla when I asked for mild salsa.  I saw the guy doing it and of course stopped him immediately This was also at the Gilbert location.  I'm going to go try Costa Vida. I heard they know what they're doing and the food is similar."}
{"text":"The salmon tacos are awesome. My coworkers and I are here every Friday without fail. The special drinks are great. I like the mint lime."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I'm beyond frustrated and I actually like Cafe Rio. This place was chaotic and didn't have a nice flow at all. 

I get up to the line and we had just beat the lunch rush which was nice. We get up to the counter to order and there was barely a smile from the lady and no interaction or engagement in any thing. I ordered a steak quesadilla. She begins to put the meat on it and then take 3 huge chunks back into the bin shorting me big time. She shorted me so much the whole 1/4 of the quesadilla didn't have one piece of meat in it. Fine, I just looked past it. When I sit down yo eat my meat was not hot and rather cold to barely warm. And was \"heated\" from the melting of the cheese in the quesadilla. 

I asked what comes with it and the other lady had to ask the initial person taking my order what went with it. Where is the training??? Ok no big deal. They had no fresh guacamole like the branding states they do and it was halfway brown. How fresh was it? Not, in my opinion. We get to pay and the cashier was working with another individual that had a problem with pavement or something. It seems like we waited forever. Oh and in the meantime we have ZERO acknowledgement saying \"I will be with you in a moment\" nothing at all. I mean when it's lunch, ppl have to get back to work not wait in line to deal with other nonsense. The lady was there talking to the cashier for maybe another 20+ min. Meanwhile the line was backed up to the max. If it's affecting customer experiences like that, just give the meal away it's not even worth the money at that point, it's the time. I felt bad for the others waiting in line. 

I start to eat my food and it's just ok. I wasn't excited at all. Like I said, the meat wasn't even hot and the guac wasn't fresh. The other cafe rio on Tatum was much better. This place was filthy. The counters weren't wiped down, the trash was piling up, the tables were sticky and not clean, I mean come on guys??? I get a drink and one drink was totally out at their lemonade station and for my entire lunch hour it wasn't ever refilled. Then I want a refill and the ice machine is out of ice. Help me understand this concept? The berry lemonade was a different taste from my first experience as well. Not sure what's up with that but wasn't as good. 

My overall experience at this location was absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. The one on Tatum is clean and people are super friendly. How can their be such a disconnect? Maybe they were short staffed, but figure out how to work with what you have. Tough review, but I'm not gonna sugar coat this."}
{"text":"Food tastes great. Just had the enchilada and the tortilla soup. It's a little in the salty side, but there is a lot of flavor regardless. I especially love the brightness of the tortilla soup. They put a lime wedge directly in the soup, and there are plenty of pieces of diced avocado in it as well (just enough to brighten it - not the main ingredient). I've had their taco salads, and those have always been perfect for me."}
{"text":"So my fiancé just left from there. Let's just say he wasn't pleased with the service. There was a father and daughter in front of my fiancé and the \"distributing line\" accidentally grabbed my fiance's order and just started putting every topping on both our quesadilla and tacos. The \"kids\" working behind the counter then bagged it for the father and daughter. After explaining to the cashier that it wasn't his order my fiancé had to have them remake both the quesadilla and the tacos. Also the young lady who took my fiance's order was very rude! We LOVE Cafe Rio and come here all the time! Maybe it was just a bad day but regardless there needs to be a bit more communication between the workers. The food was very tasty as always though!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with their food. Meat so tender. Tortillas are fresh. I am happy happy happy. We will definitely be back again I promise that. You have won me over Chipotle anyday. About a 4 mile drive but well worth it."}
{"text":"I went here on the 2nd day of business so I still think they are working out a few kinks.  I love the different options they have which make it stand out more than Chipotle.  I had the chile beef burrito enchilada style.  It was really good, it was so big I couldn't finish it.  The bf had a steak quesadilla which he loved and my friend had nachos which looked good.

There is stuff on the menu that I will return to try.  It looked like they hired about 100 people and had them all working!  It was kind of confusing at times but I am sure with time it will all get ironed out!  Good Job bringing something different to the area!"}
{"text":"This review has been a long time coming.  The service at this location has been consistently terrible.  We stopped in for dinner about a week ago, maybe an hour and a half before closing.  All of the employees were focused on cleaning.  The horchata and other custom drinks had all been drained while we were ordering.  Had I known this I wouldn't have purchased a drink.  Another employee was whacking his broom against the dust pan quite loudly within three feet of the table we were eating at.  I noticed I was given the wrong sauce, and walked over to the counter to get it replaced, however, none of the employees present could be bothered to stop cleaning.  Very rude behavior from the staff, and the food was warm at best.  Do not purchase food from this location.

In the past, their food has been really great, however, the last few times we've gone we have been incredibly disappointed.  We used to frequent this place for lunch multiple times a week.  We will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food for reasonable prize. I like tamales they serve here and hope they serve them every day instead of just Thursday's."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is one of my favorites! Everything I have ever tried here is tasty, flavorful and always fresh. Their tortillas are homemade and if you're lucky, you will be able to catch them rolling and pinning on the way to the hot stone.

The tacos, burritos, enchiladas are great but my all time favorite is the sweet pork quesadilla.  It is just perfect and made just right to order. Dependent on the day, I may cheat further with chips, salsa and queso.  Boy, do I love mexican food!  YUM!"}
{"text":"This place is gringo heaven, the music is much louder than it needs to be , the food is average by the time you stand in line and order, wait to pay and get to your table your food is less that hot. A co worker recommend this place trust me there are to many good Mexican hole in the walls that are clean and have great food in this neighborhood"}
{"text":"I've never been here before but my boyfriend sold me on this place with \" it's similar to Chipotle but with tortilla soup\". I'm not one to ever turn down tortilla soup so I was game! Besides the soup I also ordered a kid's quesadilla. 
All seemed to be right in the world until I had a spoonful of soup and it was ICE COLD. 
Do you know how long you need to keep a vat of hot soup off of a heat source for it to get cold? A really long time! Which tells me NO ONE was checking the temperatures of the food and no one bothered to notice the heat source wasn't on. 
So after my first bite of cold soup, I took it up to the cashier and I got a deer in the headlights look. Like they were confused about needing to fix my problem. 
I was asked if I wanted them to warm it up. Seriously? NO. Do you know what that's going to do to my avocado? 
So they offered to make me a new one from scratch. I sat down and ate my kids quesadilla and my boyfriend wolfed down his burrito. Then I was done and bored and still hungry and I didn't have any soup. 
So I went and asked for a refund. They assured me it would only be a few more minutes. At this point I had waited almost 10 min for new soup. No thank you. 

What could have been a Rock My Socks sort of experience turned into me vowing to never come back here again. The food wasn't edible, the customer service was horrible and I can't trust a place that does not check the temperatures of their food since I have no desire to get food poisoning,"}
{"text":"I should have read some reviews before because I am disappointed in the fact that I paid $12 for a damn steak burrito and a side of guac. Which I had to add salt to. Food was meh. I guess I expected it to have some boldness to it. It's was okay. I'd come back if it was in the $5-$7 range, but definitely not $12!"}
{"text":"This place has rotting vegetables on display  above the food counter and trash all over the floor. It felt really dirty. Food was good, I ordered tacos since it's the special on Tuesday. The only bad thing is, I got someone else's order. So instead of sweet pork I got green chili pork. I would have taken it back but I was already too far into my lunch break. This place is losing what made it so great. This is officially my last visit here."}
{"text":"Beats out any of it's competition. The tortillas are made fresh- which makes a huge difference in the flavor. I've never had a bad experience at any of their locations. SO glad we decided to give it a try. Definitely have become a regular. 
P.S.- that creamy cilantro dressing is so good- my husband and I have to get extra sides of it... which anything we order... try it :)"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Got the pork.  The service was not all that great.  Why do the employees look so irritated to be there?  Nobody smiles or looks up from their post.  Many of the tables were dirty and we had a hard time finding a clean place to sit.  We keep coming back here because the food is delicious every time.  It's just sad when you look around at the staff though."}
{"text":"The sweet pork is off the charts delicious! The salad with the sweet pork and their house dressing (tamatillo-cilantro) was amazing and I'm very picky about salads! Huge servings and great value for your buck!"}
{"text":"Our office staff orders from Cafe Rio at least once a month so you know we like the food, especially the chips and queso :) The reason for only two stars, however, is from our last order yesterday (owner, take note). We had 3 orders along with the chips and queso and the order was done online. Not a big or complicated order but when, back at the office, we started eating, we found that 2 of the orders were wrong. One pork salad, one chicken but they each had different requests with ingredients. Because one salad that was ordered was for someone with specific dietary needs, she couldn't eat it. She called Cafe Rio, spoke with the manager to ask that either the salads be replaced or a refund be given. She got a very rude response, the manager asked if she was knew what chicken and pork looked like, said she made the salads herself and they were perfect. Except, they weren't. They were wrong and could have hurt someone if they ate the \"perfect\" salad. Ok, we all make mistakes but this was bad, bad customer service. The supervisor did not any questions, did not apologize but became defensive and oppositional. Since I was the one picking up the order, I know it was not busy at the time of our order. They did grudgingly replace the salads to their credit and I know we will go back but please, Cafe Rio, work on training your staff on customer service! Being understanding and kind doesn't take much but it makes a place to eat more like a favorite place to go."}
{"text":"Was just in getting an order to go, we arrived at 8:25 they don't close until 9. I really have never had a more rude experience at a restaurant. Cafe Rio was great when we lived in Utah but the Arizona Cafe Rio is nothing like that. The food isn't nearly as great and the service is awful"}
{"text":"If I could give the customer service tonight zero stars I would. I was very uncomfortable at the rude change of language when I made a simple request to have fresh meat instead of the sloppy bottom of the barrel meat. Disappointing because I'm a very frequent customer."}
{"text":"After coming here since they've opened, I've had it with the poor quality. The tres Leche cake is basically dry pound cake because they don't put enough milk in it anymore, much less whipped cream. The 1.99 side of guacamole was one TEASPOON in size. The chicken used for the buritto was less than half what they used to use. It's been steadily declining for the past year. We're done going to this location."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, a bit too expensive for lunch. 

We got there, my colleagues and I to grab lunch just before 1:00pm & we're glad we did coz the line was kinda long already and it got much longer while we were in it. 

While in the line, you have the chance to look at the menu and you also can see them preparing freshly made tortillas. It was slightly hard to order with all the noise in the now almost full restaurant and the line was moving a bit too slow but we managed to order after all. 

I ordered the grilled steak burrito and decided to add the free salsa on the side as well as guacamole and sour cream (which aren't free with the burrito). It also comes with free pico and lettuce. I also ordered a small drink. Price: $16+! Not exactly the amount I am willing to pay for lunch. 

The burrito tasted very good. The meat was tender and the sauces had a good amount of heat. The salsa was slightly too spicy for me but it still tasted pretty good. Honestly the burrito was a good size with rice and beans inside, it filled me up for the next 7 hours! So all in all, good experience but I will have to reconsider going there again for lunch due to the price of the food."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, amazing tortillas, but the last two times visiting here the salsa and queso has been either to salty(like eating a salt packet)to eat or burned. They just need a couple tweaks and then it would be a great experience.   Still keeping my hopes up for some improvement."}
{"text":"Usually, we like the food here. It is kinda pricey for what it is but I think you get a decent portion for the cost. However, it seems like these guys choke under pressure and are unable to coordinate the traffic flow. The result: me paying more for a burrito with stuff I did not order (because they are being cheaper now and not putting a piece of meat on top thar indicates your order! So we asked for a premium meat thought that is what was in there- paid the premium and got something cheaper) and the burrito was  cold to boot. Of course there was this really annoying guy in front of us who decided to order extra stuff at the last minute whilr on the phone with his family -- causing our order to sit there extra long and the staff couldn't have us go in front to pay for our already completed order while he was screwing around. So we had to return the food and get our money back which also took awhile and they couldn't give us back our $5 credit we had (for not being there in ahwile- gee, I wonder why!). There is no direction here whatsoever and management seems to be MIA and/or completely clueless. Sorry, but I am over it. We aren't coming back and I am most certainly no longer recommending people to this circus."}
{"text":"I gave Café Rio a second try recently, since my friends wanted to try it out, and I solidified that I am not a fan. The concept is phenomenal, and I admire the fact that there is plenty of options but the food lacks taste; It's simply bland! I must admit that I loved their corn tortillas and salsa, but the meat just doesn't cut it. If you are a true taco fan, you know the taco filing is key. 

Overall, if you are looking for a great Mexican food experience, this is not the place. My opinion is subjective of course, so maybe I did not try the best thing on the menu, but the tacos are \"no bueno.\" 

Tacos I ordered: 
- Vegetarian - its just beans and rice and if you're vegan ask for no cheese 
- Steak - is a $1.50 extra, the steak lacks flavor but is tender 
- Pork Barbacoa - it's too sweet.. they should honestly rename it to BBQ pulled pork :)
- Chicken Tinga - this was a little better, had more flavor when you added salsa"}
{"text":"The cilantro lime vinaigrette costs $1.00. I wasn't aware of that when I asked for some but it was pretty tasty. The sour cream is $0.59 as well which is weird to me. So I ordered tacos and the only thing it came with was meat, lettuce, and Pico De Gallo. That's it? Everything else costs money? I ended up spending $13 on two tacos, rice and beans. That's not an unaffordable amount, but if I got the tacos just as they came with nothing in it, they would be boring. The rice was very plain. No flavor. The horchata was really good too.

Overall, decent food but expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for lunch last week right at opening (1030) and while my meat filling (barbacoa) was ready, my friend's (steak) was not.  In exchange for our having to wait, they comped our entire meal without our even saying anything or lodging any kind of complaint.  Plus the barbacoa was phenomenal as always.  Love this place and their willingness to \"make it right\" is refreshing."}
{"text":"I really like the salads here. The house dressing is yummy. It comes out to ~$9 but it is enough for 2 meals. My BF likes their burritos & the fact that you can get it enchilada style (no extra change). 

Unfortunately, the service is horrible. Every single staff looks like they absolutely hate being there. From the tortilla makers, the line staff, to the cashiers. I've been here 3 times now and witnessed poor service each time.

Last night was the worst. While waiting in line for nearly 30 minutes (shouldve been quicker, line wasn't that long) I heard and witnessed some inappropriate behaviors from the staff:

1) a lady asked for an extra plate because she was splitting her salad with someone else and the employee rolled his eyes and gave her an attitude about it. Same guy- the next costumer asked \"how's your day going?\" In which he responded \"it sucks\" and when she said \"oh I'm sorry to hear that\", he said \"well im stuck here, that's why\"

2) the staff was talking with each other across the kitchen about what I'm assuming an employee that quit and one said out loud \"when he left he said 'Eff this place! I'm never coming back'\". So loudly that I'm sure every other patron in line heard also. 

3) the lady rolling the dough for the tortillas stepped away for a moment and when she came back (gloves still on) she went behind the lady cooking the tortillas and began to massage her shoulders. Then she went on to continue touching and rolling the dough with the same gloves!!

4) waiting to pay my interaction with the cashier went like this: 
Me: hi
Cashier: what kind of meat did you have in your salad?
Me: barbocoa
Cashier: (rings it up) $9.15
Me: (hands over cash)
Cashier: (hands me change) your change
Me: thank you. Have a good night.
Cashier: (looks past me to the next guy) what kind of meat did you have in your salad?

The staff needs to be trained better or they overall need new staff. None of them want to be there, it clearly shows. From reading their reviews, there seems to be quite a few people who agree. I'm usually very patient but they have maxed out their limit with me. I would go a lot more often if the service was better."}
{"text":"Have you ever had a meal that leaves you equal parts full and unsatisfied? It happens to me all the time.   Here's the deal: When most people are starving they'll eat anything right?  Like, \"Is there peanut butter or maybe some triscuits in the cupboard. Oh good, I'm starving. I'll eat those.\" 

I'm the opposite.  A very common exchange in my life is:

Me: I'm staaaaarving.  
Someone (slightly) more rational than I am: Um, there's a kitchen full of food right there.
Me: No, I'm starving! I need something really good! I can't waste this!

Yes, that's right. I don't like to \"waste\" hunger.  And that is exactly what I feel like I did at Café Rio.

After reaching full-on STARVATION MODE one Tuesday Night, I set my sights on Taco Tuesday and began to research.  Yes, this is how seriously I take my bouts of hunger. It involves research.  After reading Yelp it appeared that both Café Rio and Rubio's had $1.50 tacos but Café Rio was a couple miles closer and Rubio's only had fish tacos on special so we opted for Rio.

Upon walking up to the entrance, we realized were surrounded by children, which was curious. The place seemed like Chipotle-esque fast casual Mexican. Certainly kid friendly but it's not like there was a damn play place involved. We felt like we were at a day care. It was extremely confusing.  

So we get in line and have no idea what the hell is going on. It's hard to tell if they are an \"order-off-the-menu\" place or a \"walk down the line and pick what you want you want\" place. So I just shout three different types of meat at the guy behind the counter and hope for the best.  Finally, it appears like I've reached the portion of the line where I will be dressing my tacos. 

\"Do you want lettuce and pico de gallo\"
\"Yes please\"

No other questions followed.  I saw cheese. I saw beans. I saw rice.  Were any of these offered to me? No.  Finally when it became clear this was not a \"point and get\" situation, I asked the guy behind the counter if they had a hot salsa.

\"We have our Salsa Fresca, it's the hottest we have, and it's FREE!\"

Um, yes I would assume it's free considering you are a MEXICAN RESTAURANT and it is a side of SALSA. 

Lance and I both got 3 tacos, I got an iced tea, and our bill was $16.23.  Now, I wasn't a math major, but that doesn't sound like $1.50 tacos to me. Turns out only one of the tacos we got was on special ($1.75, actually, though I did get my $1.50 number from Yelp so that's not their fault).  Grilled chicken and steak were not on special. All of the sudden, Rubio's started sounding really good.

We chose a corner table and proceeded to feed our starvation (did I mention that we were STARVING) while some Adderall-ridden 5 year old danced about 3 feet away from us.  Yes, I said dance. Girl was jumping up and down like she was at a damn Ke$ha concert with absolutely no regard for the people around her, which was probably just as well because we were too busy stuffing our faces with dry chicken, diced tomatoes posing as pico-de-gallo, and lettuce.  One thing I will say is the tortillas were delicious.

We go to leave and see a sign by the register: Children 6 and Under Get a Free Quesadilla.  Aha, mystery solved.  Probably the most satisfying part of our visit.

Moral of the story: There's a Chipotle across the street.  There's a Rubio's two miles away.  There's probably freaking peanut butter and Triscuits in your cabinet.  All of these would be better options than wasting your hunger on this place. Unless you're under 6 in which case, quesadilla party at Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"Ghetto version of Chipotle. Shredded chicken is extremely salty, red sauce is gross and burritos are always lukewarm. I only go there because I have free coupons. eh."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Better than chipotle . Had the enchilada style shredded chicken and it was delicious. Also liked that they make their tortillas fresh and  have a free quesadilla for kids under 6 which is the perfect size for my little one."}
{"text":"Normally i get good service however an employee made a mistake and added wrong items to my meal so instead of apologizing he quickly throws it in the garbage. What a waste of food!!!!!!! And man up say sorry doesn't hurt. We all make mistakes just do less daydreaming."}
{"text":"The quality of the meat and the freshness of the products definitely has me not wanting to ever step foot in the nearby Chipotle! To make things better, they make their own tortillas right on the spot! They also make sure your food is warm by running it through their conveyer belt oven. The only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars is because some of the crew members didn't know enough about the menu to make recommendations or know about what was actually included in the some of the meals. I understand if you're new to the crew, but at least pick up a menu or do something to be more proactive to provide the best customer experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food you'll have. The only draw back is that the kids who work the line and register there are a bit off. It's frequent that my order will get messed up but at least you can watch them make it so you can correct them. They simply work too fast as if their under constant pressure. 

It's still new so we'll see if it gets better. . ."}
{"text":"We did not experience a long line. Got here early though. Positives - free quesadillas for young kids, watching tortillas be made fresh, self-serve horchata and Agua frescos & other unique fresh drinks (mint lemonade), large portions. Negative - not very different than qdoba or chipotle in menu or taste, $20 for me and my two young boys for lunch (though we do have leftovers). Waive red between 3 and 4 stars - probably 3.5 if I could rate that."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here often for what we feel is our favorite comfort food. It is not exactly authentic mexican, buy wow is it good and fresh and always satisfying.

We usually split the alad and get it with sweet pork. The sweet pork is kind of what they are known for. It is mildly sweet, tender and succulent and the tortilla are hand made in front of you as you wait in line to order food. We have tried nearly everything here and I have to say nothing is bad. Everything is delicious. This is what Chipotle wishes they could have been. Fash, fresh, everything made from scratch and clean. Cafe Rio is not stuff and it is a warm and inviting family place. It is also fairly inexpensive for what you get. Most things can be split between 2 people and you both will be full.

My wife and I go about 1-2 times per week. It really is our favorite mexican food place.

Service si always 5/5 and the food is 5/5. Overall 5/5."}
{"text":"This is a place I really enjoyed, I like the food but last week I went there and they had changed the chairs and tables and the new decor totally put turn me off. I have ti feel comfortable to enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but the prices are outrageous for what you're getting  and it isn't exactly what I would call Mexican food. It's just too expensive to eat here especially considering that the taco salad is the best thing on the menu but its not really something that would make a good leftover. The decor is cute, and it's a fun atmosphere. The staff is friendly and the drink choices are excellent, but until they're going to either turn it into a nicer restaurant or lower the prices a bit, I'll just stick to a different restaurant."}
{"text":"They charge for any little exta. Want tortilla strips- on your salad that's a $1. Want a cup of cheese that's $2 I wanted some more salad dressing than the dinky little cup they give. Guess what? That's another dollar. Want steak on your salad instead of chicken or pork that will cost you an extra $1.50.  This place will nickel and dime you as the cashier smiles."}
{"text":"We have been five or six times and love the food. My wife loves the carnitas pork, and I like the fresh carne asada. I have to agree somewhat on the employees being underwhelming in terms of professionalism and courteousness sometimes, but they got my order right and again, the food is great!"}
{"text":"I thought I would give Cafe Rio a try. I had a late lunch today since I was busy fixing the dryer. So I had a chicken burrito with beans and rice enchilada style. I ordered some guacamole for $1.99 extra along with a large soda. The total damage came out to $13.25.

In my opinion, the food tastes just okay. There are way better options out there like Chipotle or Habanero's. Sorry Habanero's, I won't stray again. I ate outside today since I couldn't find a clean table. Actually it's kind of nice outside on their patio even though the outside temperature is approximately 95 degrees."}
{"text":"I was looking for something fresh and delicious for dinner tonight. I had never eaten here before so I thought I would try it out. I'm glad I did! The food was fantastic. Great flavor and good portions. I was a little overwhelmed by the ordering process, but the food was worth it. I will definitely be eating there again."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! We came a little close to close and the staff was friendly and still willing to help. Ben was very friendly and provided world class customer service. Wonderful experience, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Looks gross from the outside, I was so hesitant when my friend suggested this place for dinner! 

When you walk in, it is pretty cute looking. Casual dining but cute decor and clean. 

I ordered tacos and my friend had the quesadilla. The best part was the fresh tortillas which were fried up on the grill and nice and crispy! The carnitas I has were delightful but very greasy. The grease was dripping all over, gross. It didn't impact the taste too much however.  I had rice and beans on the side. They were not tasty. A little overcooked I think. I couldn't even eat them and I'm not too picky.

To drink they have everything you could imagine and traditional Mexican faire. I had horchata which was good. Very cinnamony and heavy."}
{"text":"Standard Taco Tuesday hangout. Just revamped the menu adding fish tacos & shrimp tacos."}
{"text":"Love this place, so much better than Chipotle. The tacos with the ranch dressing are amazing, fresh tortillas."}
{"text":"This place is 0 for 3 so far. The first time I ate here was the day after it opened so the place was packed but we had heard so many good things that we decided to wait out the line but order our food to go. When we finally made our way up to where you order they asked us the initial order questions but then continued to ask us what we wanted on our burritos even though the line hadn't moved. To accurately paint the picture for you- I am 5 foot tall standing behind 5 1/2 foot sneeze guard glass as the person making my food yells from the other end of the very loud and very crowded restaurant what else I want on my burrito. Unfortunately at this point the person making our order decides to guess what we want and completely screwed up our nacho order and was visibly frustrated when we finally made our way to our food and explained that is not what we ordered. The only reason we came back the second time is because our parents really enjoyed the San Tan location and wanted to try this location. Again, as we made our way down the line they would add items to our food before we even had the chance to say that we didn't want that. My mother in law is lactose intolerant and didn't even get a chance to say no cheese before they added a heaping handful into her burrito and then received an exaggerated sigh when she told them no cheese and they had to start over. Today my family decided to meet at this location again and even though they were not busy they still could not get it right. My husband ordered no tortilla in his salad but even though the person taking his order nodded that they understood still started the salad with a tortilla at the bottom. My husband didn't mention it because it wasn't that big of a deal but again as my mother in law ordered her burrito with no cheese they still had to remake it. To clarify: my mother in law said I would like a chicken burrito with out cheese then watched him start the burrito knowing he would probably still add cheese hoping she could catch him reaching for it but he moved through her order so quickly that even though she was ready for it she couldn't catch him. How does this place stay in business if they keeping having to remake orders? 

Pros: I love fast casual concept restaurants and the food here is good.

Cons: they rush through your order and do not pay attention to what you actually want - or do not want-  in your food."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed today! My coworkers and I ordered online ahead of time because we only have a short time to be away from work to pick up lunch and Cafe Rio is a little further away than we usually go. But we love Cafe Rio! We get there at the time we set online but our food wasn't ready. We waited and waited while the lady at the cash register ignored us. Even after we paid we waited a while. Bottom line: IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FASTER IF WE HAD WAITED IN LINE INSTEAD OF ORDERING ONLINE.  How does that make sense? Why have order ahead if it takes longer? Our stuff should have been made before the other people, not the other way around! We were late getting back to work. Not sure we will order here again, honestly. Every time I've been in to this location, the wait at the register has been a little long. They need more people at the register during lunch hour. The food was good as usual, but very unhappy with my experience."}
{"text":"Not our favorite for Mexican food but we have a friend that loves this place! This place has a pretty cool atmosphere. The serving style is similar to chipotle. We've been here twice and neither times did I really like it. They don't have what I think is more typical Mexican like three hard tacos. There style is more like soft tacos (burrito style) with rice and beans on the side."}
{"text":"As a rewards member of Cafe Rio I usually never have a problem at any location (in CA and AZ), except for this one. This location on every occasion I have been here has forgotten to give me and item and/or had to wait a very long time to pay as my food sits out uncovered. Tonight I went there to get a salad (comes in a open tortilla) i let the woman serving the food I wanted a salad she then asked me what kinds of beans and meat. I let her know. Then she asks me \"what else do you want?\" To which I responded \"lettuce?\" Not know what she was referring to. Then she says \"oh! Oh yeah okay. Do you want everything on the salad?\" I responded everything except instead of pick can I get salsa? She then piles on the salsa and still has yet to put lettuce. She then asked what else I wanted and I responded \"the salad?\"  She puts lettuce on asks again if I wanted cheese. To which I tell her yes I want everything it comes with. She then started staring off into the distance for 60-90 seconds. Then looked down added the cheese and started walking my plate to the front. I reminded her that it comes with tortilla chips and cilantro and side tortilla. She laughs and says \"oh yeah\". She adds tortilla chips. Then bring it to the register. I once again reminded her the cilantro. She adds cilantro. Then she starts to pour the salad dressing into a side cup and it is chunky because she had just dropped pick de Gallo into it serving the person before me. I notice as I get towards the end of the line and closer to the register I smell burning and the pans towards the front that would normally have beans and rice is burning. But none of the employees notice and/or care.

Meanwhile, there are 2 other employees waiting on her. One of which kept running back and forth to the bathroom he went 3 times in the 20 minute period it took to arrive and leave. 

 Never got the tortilla. Get home and the sweet pork meat is burnt probably because no one is paying attention to the heat. I will be traveling to north chandler and/or Tempe next time. The drive is worth not dealing with the horrendous service."}
{"text":"This is the kind of \"build your own\" mexican food place. There is a lot of variety, but when you make food in large quantities, then leave it out in a big pan until it is gone under some heat lamps, the quality of the food diminishes the longer it is out there. The customer does not know when the food has been replenished or how long it has been out there, so it is kind of hit or miss. Some of the food looks good to OK, some looked like it needed to be changed. Price was reasonable, but I think I would rather spend that amount or more to get food that was basically prepared for me. I see if you had a large group or had a large take away order that this kind of place would be an option, but I am seldom, if ever, in that situation. Every place has a following and meets a need, this sadly did neither for me."}
{"text":"We were so excited Cafe Rio was near our new home! Sadly, this is not the same experience you get at a Utah Cafe Rio. The work ethic is far inferior. Long lines because the workers are not efficient, not because they are incredibly busy. Many workers will be standing around while a few work hard, orders are often wrong. You have to ask for someone to clean a table and the floors. They have a rickety table that moves so much it makes you dizzy. The food is pretty good, but the poor service trade off is not worth it when there are other eateries nearby that have better, much better service. (The managers are certainly not dynamic. If I owned Cafe Rio, I would yank this a franchise.)"}
{"text":"The food is great but the service is terrible. Waited forever in a short line - they have so many inefficiencies and a poorly trained crew of distracted teenagers. There are so many people working but one 1 or 2 actually doing anything. In my 20 minutes getting through the line one worker interrupted two different workers putting together my  plate just to admire a plate she made. My other big complaint was the girl rearranging chairs, making a ton of noise dragging he chairs around while myself and others were trying to eat. The only thing that made it stop was another worker bringing in Starbucks for her. Teach your staff to focus, hustle, and be mindful. The food is too good to have such an annoying experience."}
{"text":"Great food, I would come here for the handmade tortillas. The service on the other hand is terrible. On the 4 occasions I have been here I have always had some problem with the service. They do not communicate with each other well. I wanted a veggie salad and the first guy put meat on it, than the cashier charged us for the guacamole (which comes with the veggie option) and she charged us for the meat after we told someone 3 different times that it was suppose to be veggie. 
It is a cool environment but service needs work"}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time here. 1st time I absolutely loved this place. This time nor so much. I asked to sample the beef so the girl hands me a sample with nothing to eat it with. I had to go get a fork. She did not listen to me correctly when she was making either of the burritos I had asked for. I took them anyway..  worst complaint was at the register. I waited and and waited to pay but no help. finally a guy that was talking on the phone gets a girl that was on her break to ring me up. She was kinda pissed.. So I'm hoping that this was just a off day for them.
I love the food so I will give them another chance."}
{"text":"Food is not bad, have to get the grilled chicken or steak or sweet pork. Everything else is extremely bland. Just average food for way too high a price."}
{"text":"Pretty neat place. I'd never seen this chain before. I got a burrito with grilled chicken, enchilada style. SUPER glad I got it enchilada style--that sauce is great! I wish, however, that I got shredded chicken. Oh well. The burrito is a good size; I split it with a friend and we were both fill at the end without being stuffed. I'd definitely come back!

(One thing I thought was weird though, is the price for the quesadilla was more than the burrito! Wonder why?)"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio strikes me as morph of Rubio's decor and Chipotle's (slightly expanded) menu. It was clean, brightly colored and the service was quick.

I ordered the Sweet Pork Barbacoa Burrito (pictured) and found the title to be spot on. I was a bit put off by the sweetness of it, finding the sauce to taste like an extra sweet BBQ sauce. It completely overpowered the flavor of the meat. The pico de gallo topping would have been just average, but I must say the diced tomatoes were ripe and tasted just off the vine.

Be aware, the acoustics of the restaurant and the music over speakers make for a loud environment. I couldn't even hear the employees' questions!

There are so many dining options in the area that I'm not sure I'll return. If I do, I'll steer clear of the sweet sauce, but give the yummy raspberry lemonade another swig!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  First of all it was so cold in there people were huddling together. Couldn't have enjoyed the meal no matter how good. 

Had chicken burrito. There was something sweet in it that I did not like. Salsas were not great either."}
{"text":"I come here often I would like to thank the following people for taking good care of myself and my friend who is the cancer patient that is addicted to chips and salsa. These are the people who always take such good care of us: Luis, Juan, Mike, and Rosie.

Laurie runs the place, she has managed to place together a cohesive,  professional, and friendly group of people who really enjoy their job. You can actually tell, when somebody comes in they greet them and say hello not because they're supposed to do it but because they want to really make the person feel welcome!

We normally get the chips and salsa it is very good for a very modest price. All of the food is handmade right before your eyes it is all very fresh. They have no problems here with their food their delivery or the impeccable cleanliness of the restaurant. So we like it you should too! 5 Stars. And again a special thank you to Lori and Luis they took really good care of me today."}
{"text":"I never write a review but I feel it is necessary, I came to this restaurant and while waiting in line to get my food prepared a customer in front of me handled  a tip to the girl who was preparing the food this girl should not be handling any money when preparing food,but the way she didn't bother to change her gloves after taking the money from a customer and proceeded to prepare my food, of course I didn't take the food nether I paid so I contacted the manager to explain this issue and the general manager seemed to be careless about this situation, they didn't apologize,I'll never come back to cafe rio, I strongly encourage people to to go there."}
{"text":"My first trip to Cafe Rio.  I had the sweet pork burrito, enchilada style, with habanero sauce.  It was really good.  Everything is fresh.  The tortilla soup is amazing.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This location needs help from the Biltmore location. Cilantro was withered and not nearly as fresh as I am used to, tortillas were overdone to the point that part of it was actually crunchy, and the Horchata was really bland. Asked the girl to just put the pico on the taco but she insisted it had to be on the side - not a big deal but I didn't really understand why she had such an attitude about it. I had been raving about this place to my new coworkes (after going to the Camelback location once a week for the last 6 months) and although they thought everything was great, I am sad that I am going to have to find a new go-to place for Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"The place was clean, the food prep was fresh and fast. I had the grilled chicken burrito and it was delish. 

The only reason I took off one star was I was walking out with my leftover chips and salsa, the salsas toppled over and flew to the ground, splattering everywhere. The gal who worked there just stood there and looked at me and turned away. Didn't offer to help, didn't offer to get a refill, literally turned her back and walked away. I thought that was extremely rude. Clearly my hands were full and I could have used some assistance. Typical Scottsdale I suppose."}
{"text":"If I were to just judge this place on the food, it would get 4 stars. The steak was good, and the toppings were fresh. You can get your burritos enchilada-style, or just with cheese melted on top. They have plenty of menu options--burritos, salads, tacos, tostadas, enchiladas, nachos, and seven different proteins to choose from.

My problem is that it is severely overpriced. They charge extra for too many items, including sour cream. But even without the up-charges, a simple steak burrito for $11 after tax is a bit much. You can get food of similar or better quality at similar portion sizes for a much lower cost in many restaurants throughout the Valley. I probably will not return because of this unless I have a friend who really needs to try Cafe Rio for some reason."}
{"text":"A great tasting tortillas.

If you enjoy Chipotle then you will Love Café Rio. Somewhat same concept, however Cafe Rio has much better food. The tortilla's are hand made and absolutely delicious. So is there fresh homemade guacamole. You have to try Cafe Rio's sweet barbocoa pork, it is amazingly tender and succulent.

 Cafe Rio is an excellent Mexican Grille, that's quick, however Cafe Rio doesn't skimp on the big bold flavor. I prefer to get the taco salad with the pork barbacoa or green chili beef.  Make sure you try the house cilantro lime ranch dressing, a wonderful compliments for your salad.

Homemade tortillas, daily specials and fun atmosphere add up to a great place to eat. Reasonable pricing and great service.  Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointed 

Today I Went to the Cafe Rio Mexican Grill for lunch. The restaurant was crowded, however people were moving through the cafeteria style line and receiving their entrée's very fast. 

At Cafe Rio, you select the type of food you want to eat, add the meat, beans, sauces, and extras according to your own preferences.  Everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. The tortillas at Cafe Rio are made to order so I knew I was going to order a burrito because I really enjoy homemade tortillas.

As your looking at the menu it seems as if you are being hurried through the serving line.  On my first visit I ordered  a sweet pork burrito with, cheese, black beans, rice and salsa.  As you place your order, the food is passed down the cook line and tossed behind  onto a conveyor belt which runs your entrée through an oven. 

To be honest I was somewhat disappointed in the quality and taste of the food.  My entrée had an overwhelming taste of salt, it was all I could taste.  The burrito just wasn't very good.

I assumed that Cafe Rio would be another version of Chipoltle because the serving style and food items are very similar but I think I prefer Chipoltle. 

To end on a postive note Cafe Rio is clean, well decorated, and the employees are friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Queso! Guacamole! Amazing tortillas! Freshly squeezed Mint Limeade!

I loved the environment. I felt very welcome and was totally entertained!

Make sure you tell them if it is your first visit, order nachos and get a surprise!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went for dinner in early Sept, 2012.  The vegetarian salads were loaded with romaine and white rice and black beans mixed together.  The bean mixture had a pasty consistency.  The tortilla underneath the salad is cold by the time you can get to it.  The noise level was quite loud both in the volume of music and overall acoustics.  The evening sun poured in to the entire restaurant and people were walking around shielding their eyes.  Not a great first impression."}
{"text":"Food has always been excellent whenever we've eaten here.  Had the tortilla soup for the first time and it's amazing - my new fav. The manager here is amazing, she's very friendly and customer-focused.  Last night, on our way home from a long road trip,  my husband and I arrived about 10 mins before they closed and in an attempt to be helpful to the employees we asked what would be easiest for them to make.  She made sure to emphasize (in such a kind way) that we should order whatever we want and not to worry about them or the time.  She didn't rush us or the order and made us feel like we were their first customers and not the last. We tried to leave a tip but she refused and said to pay it forward to someone in need.  We will definitely be back!  Thanks for the amazing service!"}
{"text":"A year since my first review.  Time to review again!

Over the past year we've been here a few times.  We've tried most of their offerings by now.  Stick with the burro.  The tostada didn't have much meat, and neither did the tacos.  The enchiladas were really just smaller burros (especially if you get the burro \"enchilada style\").  I don't know why they bother with the other options.  Just get the burro and be happy.  Their best is probably the chile beef (shredded) with red sauce.  At Chipotle I prefer the carnitas, but here it's the chile beef.

The burro is very good.  As good as Chipotle or Qdoba or any of those.  The staff is generally friendly and helpful, the drinks are sorta unique (in addition to the soda fountain they have horchata and some \"-ades\" like mango lemonade).  I like the diner's/stamp card (after 10 entrees you get one free).

A solid three stars here."}
{"text":"Wow...it's been almost 3 years since I reviewed this place.  Well, really, nothing has changed.  It's still quasi-Mexican, still similar to Chipotle in format and ingredients (both places boast of using fresh ingredients, and both places have an assembly line in which you tell them what you do and don't want in your burrito/bowl/tacos).  The line moves reasonably quickly, the food is pretty good.  I would definitely choose this Mexican fast-food over Taco Bell or most other fast-food places, Mexican or burger or chicken fast-food.  For what it is the food is good.

They do have more varieties of drinks here than Chipotle.

I can't quite say I'm a fan, so I can't quite go to 4 stars.  When is Yelp going to allow half stars??  This is a solid 3.5, in my opinion."}
{"text":"First time to this location today at lunch. Ordered the new spicy green chili with pork burrito. It ended up being really sweet, not sure if they gave me the sweet pork or that's the right pork for this dish but it was not good. The staff was not friendly at all. They were talking to each other more than they were talking to the customers. Gave it two stars because the guacamole was excellent."}
{"text":"This is the best Cafe Rio around.  food is always fresh and staff is very friendly.  Very crowded during 5pm rush hour."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service! An hour and a half before closing, the woman manager told us that they were out of chicken and got all defensive when we asked if they can make more... AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE. She began giving a lot of attitude for no reason so we went to Chipotle instead. Thanks for nothing Cafe Rio, we will never be going back because of your very poor customer service from that manager."}
{"text":"Their food is great, but the service here sucks. Most of the workers are rude and couldn't be bothered to give you any respect. If you catch Cici \"the manager\" on a good day she's nice, but catch her on a bad day and she will roll her eyes at you. Super awesome customer service, not. I'd rather drive 10 miles out of my way to go to the Cafe Rio on Gilbert&Ocotillo."}
{"text":"It's fine, a little pricey, but kind of upscale mexican."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio! well, I did until this past Sunday......we ate dinner there.  My dinner friends had shredded chicken and the steak.  I had the sweet pork on a salad. Within an hour of eating there I was sick.  Oh so sick.  I don't need to give further details but WHOA.  I am still not 100% better.  If you are in the mood for Rio go to the Gilbert and Baseline location."}
{"text":"This has been my second-favorite place to eat in Flagstaff, so I was looking forward to having it down in the Valley. 

It was kind of disappointing. The horchata wasn't great as it had been each time up north, although the container was almost empty. Several minutes later when staff refilled it, I tried a little, and it was probably better, although I had drank enough by then. 

I did add the hazelnut \"shots\" to the beverage and that made it pretty flavorful.

However the food itself didn't impress me, either. I got what I know I like. This time it seemed dry. I asked for more salsa, and the woman added two more scoops of pico. I think what it needed was twice as much regular salsa as they added.

I got the veggie burrito. I would have liked to see bell peppers and onions added inside it. They don't seem to have those staple Mexican ingredients. It was just beans and rice in there, and a little salsa and maybe pico de gayo and cheese.

It was good. Just dry. And not what I was used to, or expecting.

Although my aunt and uncle went there with me to experience their first visit. They both liked it.

That's why it's three stars, instead of two. Because it disappointed me (leaving me \"low and dry\"), although it was still good, just not as good as what I'm used to having from the other location."}
{"text":"Had my first experience with cafe Rio today.  It's basically a chipotle with more options and in my opinion tastes better.  It's kind of expensive. I had the tostada with chicken and a coke and it was over $9. There was a pretty big portion though,  I ate about 75% of it and I didn't even have all the available toppings.  Don't tell them it's your first time unless you enjoy being embarrassed as they sing a very long,  loud and obnoxious song while banging on the stainless steel counters.     

Overall I would eat there again but I wouldn't seek it out."}
{"text":"Great service! The staff at this location appear to work harder then any other burrito establishment.   I was flabbergasted at how hard they work, as well as, how nice they were! 

I was shocked to see that they didn't have a tip jar because I wanted to give them a deserving tip. The cashier was AWESOME, very friendly as well! 

Definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Barbacoa Pork anything is our favorite... Taco Tuesdays are our favorite... The staff is not our favorite"}
{"text":"Terrible. We tried to eat here. Not even 8 pm and they were out of steak and chicken on a Saturday night then they proceeded to tell us they can start some steak \"if we want\" No it's cool don't inconvenience yourselves on our behalf, you're only a restaurant, guess having food for your paying customers isn't a priority. And we drove all the way here from surprise for this place."}
{"text":"Good food, I waited in line for about 30 min tho, I'm not sure if it was totally worth it"}
{"text":"The food here is 'American' Mexican food, just as a heads up.  Would recommend it to friends, but it is a tad pricey and probably not the first place I'd go to if I was in the mood for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Here in Phoenix finding a Mexican food joint is about as difficult as finding an UN-shaded parking spot.
Being relatively new to the city, I haven't had the pleasure of having Mexican regularly at my disposal and at different levels of service/price/atmosphere etc.
Cafe Rio sits nicely in a niche all it's own.
First of all it's like a fiesta in there! The decor is festive and fun. It's usually BUSY!! Especially between 11:30am and 2pm and 5pm-7pm. It's kid friendly too so there are always tons of little frijoles jumping around making a racket so I generally take out. 
The food is AWESOME!! It's all homemade and with bountiful portions! The have a different special everyday and all of their tortillas are make in-house. Everything comes smothered in your choice of delectable toppings: guacamole, cilantro, salsas, pntos, black beans, sour cream, cheeses...
The drinks fountains include all the usual suspects as well as several house-made delights like mint-lime lemonade and traditional horchata, all bottomless!
The salads are perfect for those carb-a-phobes like myself who just want greens protein and fat! 
The service is cafateria-style, line up and get ready to order cuz it's fast and furious until you get to the till, kinda like Speedy Gonzales and Subway had a baby.
The prices are decent and they even have a frequent-diner card that earns you freebies. Now I know many of the more traditional Mexican places in town are dirt cheap, but uh, the key word there is dirt...you get what you pay for and you get it in spades here!
Perfect for anyone wanting something quick and deliciously nutritious. Eat in or take-out it's all good! They may not sell booze, but it's a culinary carnival just the same!
Yo quiero Cafe Rio! Con muchos amor amigos!
Hasta pronto!"}
{"text":"I can dig this place... and definitely well over any Chipotle. I still don't understand everyone's fanaticism of that place.  Not when there's places like this.  Very generous portions and good flavor. We ordered a steak burrito and a tostada  (which was like a tostada with a very large salad- bonus!!!)... quick food, good price, fresh."}
{"text":"First time here and definately not the last. Excellent location with outside seating and no passing traffic whatsoever. I had a burrito bowl and it was delicious. Very inexpensive with large portions."}
{"text":"The quality of this location has gotten better. Probably the last several times I've been there my order has been perfect. The food is always good. Employees however are always a little off. The line prep people have been great the last few times. But there's this short woman that seems to run the place. She has long conversations with me and asks personal questions when customers are around and waiting behind me. It holds up the line and while the line is getting longer she'll stop paying attention to the customer paying, and start chirping at her employees. Sometimes when I ask for my order to go, she'll say \"No, stay. Why don't you have it here?\" She has literally enticed me to stay by offering me a free drink. And it worked."}
{"text":"The food is wonderful. The tortillas are made fresh right in front of you .  Everything is made to order and the chili beef and tortilla soup are out of this world! The portions are very large too."}
{"text":"Whoever gave this place a low rating must not have been served by Melissa! (Sorry if I spelled that wrong) but she was wonderful and so full of life! Even at the end of a long shift she was still smiling! Hope she gets some credit. Thank you love!!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Utah and I am a Cafe Rio LOVER! When I found out there would be a cafe rio right around the corner from my house here in Avondale, I think I almost jumped out of my chair.  When I first went to this restaurant I was somewhat disappointed though.  When I ordered my salad they forgot most of the items, but put extremely large amounts of the items they remembered on it.  I chocked this up for \"this place is new and they are still learning the \"cafe rio\" ways\".  I went back again, and I ordered the tortilla soup.  When I got home, I found out they only put chicken and broth in the soup.  I again just chocked it up to it being so new.  

I go back because I LOVE THE FOOD, but this particular Cafe Rio is so inconsistent with their knowledge and their attitude towards everyone.  The Cafe Rio downtown Phoenix, Mesa and all of the Cafe Rio's that I have been to in Utah are EXTREMELY friendly and always aware of the menu, at this Cafe Rio, no one can ever remember what is on the menu or what size items are supposed to come in.  

Today I went back, again because I LOVE the food and I want to keep giving this place another chance, but when I walked up to the front like I usually do, the lady behind the glass grabbed a tray and just stared at my sister and I.  Then after staring for a moment or two, stated \"Can I help you\"... we informed her we would like the kids casadilla with chicken.  On the menu it says \"choice of beans or rice  and comes with chips and drink.\"  When she asked us \"beans and rice?\" we said yes please.  Then towards the end, we asked why we didn't get chips, the cashier said \"you got beans and rice\".  We then said well we are confused because it comes with chips and a drink. The lady at the front said \"no, you can pick 2 of the 3 items.\"  When we told her we were confused because that is not how it is written on the menu she just stated our total again. I don't care about what is in the kids meal, but the menu is inconsistent with what they tell us at the beginning.  

I love this food, except when it is prepared by the people at this particular venue.  
-Staff never knows the menu
-Staff rarely friendly
-Food never has accurate ingredients (i.e wrong cheese, no pico, only chicken and broth in the tortilla soup etc.)
-Poor amounts of items (too much dressing, too little chips, not enough cheese, etc.)


I will continue to go to Cafe Rio, but I will make the drive to Phoenix and Mesa because this particular venue is depressing and makes all of the other Cafe Rio's look bad."}
{"text":"BEST TORTILLA IVE EVER HAD! Love the variety of food and drinks 

Gets really busy on a Sunday though but worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"This place is an exact imitation of chipotle but a lot worse. After waiting 40 minutes in line the place was out of steak during the middle of the day on a Saturday. Employees were rude and tried to rush everyone with their orders. The least they could have done is inform everyone that they were out of a certain ingredient to avoid waiting in line. 

I ordered a burrito with chicken. The burrito barely had any meat in it and was overflowing with rice and beans. I was disgusted when I had seen their whole batch of guacamole was dark brown so I opted not to have it. The restaurant was also out of coke and their sprite tasted like water. Worst experience at a Mexican place and most definitely never coming here again. Go to chipotle trust me you'll be a lot more satisfied than eating at this place."}
{"text":"Good burritos, fresh tortillas but you did not give me my discount on national burrito day..... (you emailed me asking for me to come in to get a discount on any burrito purchase)"}
{"text":"I ordered a pork burrito enchilada style, it looked so good but when I tastes it was overly sweet, I tried to get over it but it was too much=( On the other hand I had the chips and salsa and they where delicious. Willing to go back and try it maybe stick to the enchilasdas"}
{"text":"People, stop leaning over the germ glass to place your order.  It's there for people like you :) .  Food is reliable and good."}
{"text":"I always get the steak salad here, it's so flavorful. Try it with the vinaigrette! Me and my friend came in half and hour before they closed on a Tuesday and Edwin was the absolute NICEST employee we've ever experienced. We usually just came for the food because most of the time the service was sub par but Edwin made us feel welcome, appreciated, and made sure we were happy with our meals!"}
{"text":"Food is great.  No doubt.  Don't miss the Sweet Pork Barbacoa but ... 

The line is ridiculous and only because the production line is poorly devised and managed.  At a glance this is an easy fix.  It is just a matter of how the line is organized.  Check out how it's done at Chipotle or Einstein's bagels as an example.  

Not only will this move the line faster it will likely produce better employee attitudes. Right now, they appear stressed out and unfriendly ... that is unfortunate."}
{"text":"If you are advertise to be open until 10p, how about you stay open till 10 not but everything away and cleaning by 915p. Love cafe rio but this location has workers that have a attitude."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some fast food-ish Mexican food and remembered that Cafe Rio had just recently opened a location near my apartment so I decided to check it out! 
It looked nice and clean inside which is always a plus. No one likes going to a dirty fast food joint. I really liked the tables for some reason haha thought they were cute. The other reviews were correct that it is Chipotle-esque. Obviously not as fresh or tasty as Chipotle, but still not too bad.
The people working there did seem a tad clueless, but they're young and this place hasn't been open that long so that's ok. I got the vegetarian tacos and I had very low expectations for them, but honestly they were pretty good. The guy never asked if I wanted cheese on them though and I forgot to ask. Not too big of a deal though. Also I had to remind them to give me guacamole since I got veggie tacos. The guacamole was a tad brown but still edible looking. I wish they had actual vegetables to put on the vegetarian items, that would have been awesome! 
My favorite thing was the tortillas for the tacos, they were so delicious! Yum. Black beans were pretty good too. Was just like a ton of black beans and rice for me though cause the tacos were both filled with that and it came with a side of black beans and rice. 
This wasn't the best fast food Mexican experience but also not the worst! Definitely better than SomeBurros and Taco Bell, but not as good as Chipotle. Might come back to give a quesadilla a try and hopefully the staff will have their act together a little more by then."}
{"text":"We walked in past nine in the evening and the manager, Jim, was excited to see two new patrons.  He had us try some samples of the horchata and this mint lime drink.  Everything was fresh and made from scratch each day.  He was very excited to tell us about all the great things and helped us figure out what we wanted to eat. We ordered the carnitas burrito with everything (they have fresh jalapenos) in it, including the enchilada sauce on top. It  was very filling, tasted fresh and had lots of flavors.  We also ordered the carnita tostada, with the whole wheat tostada.  It was more like a big salad, but it was pretty good.  I would get shredded beef next time because the carnitas did not blend well with the other flavors of the tostada taco.  Jim is right; the horchata is the best in town.  Would stop by just for that."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite for Tacos!!! We came on tuesday and got $2 tacos that were out of this world! The rice and beans had so much flavor, and I don't ever like beans but it was only $2 to add them to the tacos! They have a raspberry hibiscus tea that is the best I've had in Arizona and they have hand squeezed mint lemonade, delicious horchata, southwest limeade, and stevia sweetened lemonade!  I could go on but I won't,  just try it!! :)"}
{"text":"Placed an order online so I wouldn't have to wait in line because I only had a short lunch break. I arrived a couple minutes after the pick up time and they hadn't even begun to make the food I ordered. There was only a few people in line it would have been lots faster to just go through the line. I got my food after waiting about ten minutes. I had ordered extra chicken on my salad which was an additional $2 not only was the service bad the salad I ordered was really sad. All the lettuce had brown wilty edges and there was only two little chunks of chicken on the entire thing not even half the normal amount. I love cafe rio but this location never has the service or quality of any of the other locations I have been too. The employees always look miserable probably the last time I will go here!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I've grown to love this place. When it comes to fast casual Mexican, I tend to choose Café Rio over Chipotle every time. For one, there's just something more authentic about the taste. For two, I get more full. And three, Café Rio now has a rewards program when you download their app. Not to mention, their military discount is a nice touch. I eat here pretty regularly now. It's been consistently good, and I usually don't need to eat again the rest of the day."}
{"text":"I'll start off with something positive: The tortillas are amazing! I also enjoyed their fresh-made Southwest Limeade, it was really refreshing! The interior decor is bright, fun, and welcoming. 

However, the service and prices is what made me decide to rate Cafe Rio 2 stars. I was charged for every little thing they could possibly get me for: a side of a salsa, sour cream, guac (expected) etc. My thing is, if you're going to charge extra for these items, at least give me a decent amount and don't skimp if I'm paying for it. 

The very end of my experience is what really disappointed me. The girl behind the cash register was clearly beyond miserable to be at work. Before she rang me up, I asked for a side of hot salsa but she was too busy rushing me to pay and didn't hear me, so I asked again just to be sure. Without saying anything to me, she turned around and yelled,\"CAN I GET A SIDE OF HOT SALSA!\" Once I paid and received my food to-go, she didn't bother to say \"thank you\" or \"have a good night\"--instead she yelled over my shoulder,\"NEXT PERSON!\" 

I don't recall ordering a burrito with a side of attitude! Anyways, I got home and realized the 'hot salsa' I had ordered was an extremely mild enchilada sauce. Not sure if that's what they consider 'hot salsa', or if it was given to me by mistake. Either way, my experience wasn't at all what I was hoping for."}
{"text":"We love this food for a quick weeknight meal .  But this location is poorly managed and sloppily maintained.  Our call in order has been wrong 6/10 times.  The food prep seems sloppy compared to other Rio's we've visited.  And the customer service isn't what it should be.  The staff seems rushed, annoyed and short."}
{"text":"I have only been here once and I will absolutely update my review if I decide to go back, but I was truly disappointed with this place. I heard from a few co-workers that this place was AMAZING. However, then went to the San Tan location. When we found out this place opened up a mile from our house, we were super excited to try it. 

We went on a Friday afternoon at about 430 and it was dead. No customers. Not a problem for us as we like hidden gems and don't like crowds. We weren't greeted when we came in but that's okay as it is not a huge deal to me but it was kind of awkward with all employees there and no direction to help us as this was our first time. The lady we had in the line was SUPER friendly and was very willing to help us. 

I decided on the burrito, and I got it enchilada style. Like other reviews, people said their food was wrong but mine was NOT. she was very patient with me, explained things and ensure I had the right choice in mind before she made it. Burrito was HUGE and plenty. Could have fed two people. My partner got the enchiladas.

Fast forward, we did get one chips and salsa to split and two drinks. Total? $37. I nearly fell out of my chair. I really should have looked over the receipt for issues, but they DO nickel and dime you like crazy. I can get the same at Chipotle for $22 or less for two people. That kinda irked me. 

Also, during the making process, they did not offer a lot of \"customizable\" options as I guess I am used too. I am not trying to compare, but there were other things however I did not know about and would have liked but didn't know I could. And we found out, those \"minor extras\" that we could get else where without being charged, they charged there. It was a little ridiculous. 

The food itself was okay. I didn't like their medium green sauce. My stomach didn't like it either. Not their fault, just my taste buds. Their regular salsa was delicious. They did not have a hot sauce. We asked for a hotter salsa and the one they said we had was their hot. It wasn't. It was the same version of Chipotle's medium. Okay, that bugged me a little. Maybe some sour cream? Nope extra. Ugh. defeated.

They had unlimited Horchata which was AWESOME. It was pretty delicious. Environment was nice. Tables little too close for comfort and would not be fun when the place is busy. 

Overall, it was not BAD, however just the flavors in my opinion did not mesh well and I had a HORRIBLE stomach ache for a day after. Just didn't agree with me. My partner liked them. He had no complaints on his enchiladas, however he said it wasn't enough to swing on back.

Again - I need to maybe give them another shot. If I do, I will get something smaller. It's just I feel like I have to get small so I don't spend almost $40 on something I am truly not happy with. We will see. I will stick with Chipotle for now."}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed with my visit today, I get in a line to order, I stand here 10 minutes but nobody serves me. 4 people stay there to talk and laugh, 1 of them is the manager. Terrible service here NEVER COME BACK 
P/s :  I can't give them even 1 star, but the system doesn't have it"}
{"text":"Food is great! Go on taco Tuesday for awesome tacos. Chicken burrito enchilada style is my favorite. Medium green sauce. Just chill and don't be uptight jerk faces."}
{"text":"My new favorite place!  Pulled chicken and pork are really good.  The burrito and the 3 taco combos are my favorite!  1000's better than Chipotle!"}
{"text":"The meat was incredibly salty, the beans were watery, the salsa was watery, the salsa that came with the chips tasted like plastic, my burrito had clumps of unmelted cheese that didn't taste anything like normal cheese associated with Mexican food, and the burrito was completely soggy and filled with watery liquid.  It was by far the worst fake Mexican food I've ever had.  They have stolen the restaurant concept of Costa Vida, which is delicious, and have thrown together a cluster-f*ck of a restaurant.  The tables are full of chairs that are all over the place, the straws don't fit the drinks, the tables are wobbly, they charge you for those little tortilla strip crumbs and they charge you for sour cream, of which you get literally less than a teaspoon, and the meat serving was a tiny little scoop of bullsh*t.  I think Cafe Rio is the crappiest food place I've eaten at in a long time.  It doesn't compare to other casual dining places like Chipotle and Costa Vida.
The service was also terrible.  No one asked us how our food was, the staff just stood around staring at us, the staff just milled around while we waited on them to finally help us, and the dining room is disorganized.  Another issue was just being nickle and dimed for literally everything, and then paying for it, and then getting crappy little portions.  The food tasted like any other processed food and was like eating a soupy, salty cheap hospital meal."}
{"text":"Yuck! Had the sweet pork burro. asked for spicy and got bland yuck! The sauce was little more than sugar and food coloring. The meal served in a take out aluminum bowl was swimming in sugary mess. Have had far better at the horrible fast food taco huts. They charge top dollar for yuck. It seems to satisfy those that desire yuppie tasteless food. Not for me or anyone with taste buds. Any one with discerning taste buds should ignore the reviewes of people bribed to lie about how good it is."}
{"text":"Well I think we're done with Café Rio. We've had issues before with them before, completely messing up orders, unprofessional staff, etc...Tonight I drove back after I had gotten home to realize the chips and salsa we had ordered and paid for weren't in the bag. Fine, an oversight, and I drove back, to get them. The cashier who helped me both times didn't even apologize once, nothing other than \"Oh\". If this was a simple error one time  it wouldn't have be an issue. But when it seems to happen often, when not even appearing busy. And to add to it, not even acknowledging the error and offer an apology? No thanks, we'll be taking our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"OMG what a waste of a dinner the other night. Food was awful. The red enchilada sauce is disgusting tasting. The burritos are down right terrible.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. The sweet pork is amazing & on Taco Tuesday it's pretty good taco's for only $1.25.  A little better out door seating and this place would be over the top"}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food, pricey and worth it. The only thing I didn't like here is the EMPLOYEES ATTITUDE.. ( her name Cecilia)NO SMILE AND RUDE. other than that it's great Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"As a vegetarian it is hard to find fresh fast food to enjoy.  This place is awesome!  I order the tostada every time and have never been disappointed.  Especially on Wednesday when it is the deal of the day and discounted.   They have a wonderful house ranch dressing that is great on all the items as well.  My husband orders the sweet BBQ in burritos and loves it.  It doesn't cost extra for enchilada style which makes seem like you are in a sit down Mexican restaurant.  I would rather go here than any other Mexican restaurant hands down.  I also love the different drinks that they have there which you can't get anywhere else such as mint limeade and many other tasty drinks.  During lunch if you order ahead it's easy to just come and pick up your meals.  They even have a punch card so after you buy 10 meals you get one free.  I LOVE this place."}
{"text":"This is probably the greatest Mexican Grill in all of Phoenix. The staff is always friendly and the food is superb. I have never ate a dish from this place that failed to meet my expectations. I prefer the sweet pulled pork burrito but their tacos and salads are just as delicious. Shout out also to Cheyenne who gave me a free drink cup after I forgot to get one during my order!"}
{"text":"Eh. Trying too hard is the phrase that comes to mind. Why, if they bill themselves as fresh Mexican food, do they smother everything in cheese and super salty sauce? I ordered the nachos and hubby had the enchiladas. First of all, his plate was pretty skimpy for $9. Two little enchiladas and a bloop each of rice and beans. My nachos were more generous, but what the heck is the point of nachos when the chips are too brittle to use as a scoop? The running everything through the oven was interesting, but again, what about \"fresh\"?
Employees were friendly enough and sang a round of \"Nacho Man\" when I ordered the nachos. It wouldn't have been so bad if the song hadn't sounded like a funeral dirge, but there was no other silliness.
Overall it was all right, but we wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"We thought this place was going to be good, it looks like chipotle set up. The food was ok but it wasn't delicious, it lacks authentic flavor. I wouldn't go back. The place looks nice though."}
{"text":"I had to bring my mom here to try it out. Love their meat and their salads. It was as clean and tidy as any other I have been to. I was bummed that they didn't have more iced tea selections. The Cafe Rio's in California have a tropical tea that is wonderful and a huge reason I go to this place."}
{"text":"The food wasn't anything to get excited about and the rice was actually pretty gross, even my rice loving kids didn't care for it and they eat everything. The chips were  actually pretty good though. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The food looks good and the presentation is great but the taste is not that great.  They have multiple type of hot salsa to pick from but nothing good or as good Mexican salsa. I also ordered a side of guacamole but couldn't eat it because it was too salty. They also put too much cheese on the food."}
{"text":"1 steak Burrito,1 chicken quesadilla..26 dollars,,,the burritos are very sloppily put together,and you have to specify NOT enchilada style or they will drench your burrito in sauce which will cause it to fall to pieces,service was terrible,the kids working the kitchen were joking about how \"every day is a bad day at cafe rio\"?!..very odd to hear before handing over 10 dollars for a burrito,the drinks(horchata,lime etc) were gross like they had been sitting for awhile..skip this place,you can get mexican food on every block in avondale and spend half what u would here...unless you like eating a 10 dollar plate of pinto bean mush....gross."}
{"text":"This place is an addiction. Literally. Find myself here a couple times a week. The employees all have a smile on their face, even if they are in their busiest time on taco Tuesday! 
If you use their app, you get points that definitely accumulate quickly!"}
{"text":"I really like Cafe Rios but will never go to this location again. I did an online order and when I got it they had given me like half a serving of chicken instead of the steak. This was annoying because I obviously didn't get what I wanted and ordered but I also paid for steak which is $1.50-2.00 more than chicken, and there seemed to be more like half a serving of chicken anyway. I called the store and the girl seemed confused but then offered to leave my receipt at the register for me to come by in the couple days to get another meal of what I actually ordered. I agreed and came in the next day for lunch. The guy read back my receipt and I confirmed I wanted all the same things. I got home to the wrong meal again. They forgot the sour cream and I ordered pinto and black beans with no rice and instead got pinto beans with lots of rice. Very disappointed and not looking to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"What can I say....great food and crappy service. The food outweighs the service I. This case. Very rare for me."}
{"text":"Got there today at 10;40 and the regulars were lining up for the Taco Tuesday deal. I took my time and strolled over and a couple of regulars told me they get the food to go and separate the salad and tomatoes for later, so I followed suit. I ordered all but pork and especially liked my vegan one. It was all fresh.

 The place was clean and the staff was very nice, helpful and patient. 

I'll return next week too. Oh and I got my grand girl a nino quesadilla (free) sweet deal. Also down load their app.

I also like the tortilla soup."}
{"text":"It's not as good as the one in Tempe. The food tasted bland even though I ordered the same thing all the time at the Rural location, so I don't know how that happened. I didn't deal with the issues that the other people mentioned about the lack of cleanliness and poor service. The cashier could have been more friendly and welcome, but I didn't really deal with anything seriously wrong here. I would say that I need to try this place out again to see if it's decent or if the other reviews are true. But yeah, the food was definitely a 3."}
{"text":"Really good food, nice outside seating during spring weather. Price was acceptable. Biggest problem is to avoid it during the rush. Super packed."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food! 3 stars for the workers (mainly the young kids).

I am so in love with this place that since they have opened I have already received 2 free meals (they give out punch cards \"buy ten get one free\")!! I always order the chicken burrito enchilada style. I am a very picky meat eater and I will tell you their chicken is amazing! All white, tender, flavorful, no fat! Portions are huge and you can get in and out of their quick! I actually disagree with a lot of the other reviews indicating that Chipotle is more fresh and tasty! NO WAY. Cafe rio is extremely fresh and WAY BETTER than chipotle! I am a HUGE fan!

My only complaint is that some of the workers behind the bar, mainly the high school kids, either have a bad attitude like they don't feel like working, or plain just don't listen so you end up having to correct them multiple times to get your review right. Their is this one kid their that is in constant super speed mode, which I give him props for but, he doesn't slow down enough to listen and ends up making a lot of mistakes. I am sure this will work itself out once this place isn't newly opened.

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I have truly missed Cafe Rio until this one opened up!!! So much better than chipotle! Love the steak salad. If it's your first time going to a Cafe Rio, do yourself a favor and just pick a meat, pick a salad or burrito and let them make it the way it was meant to be made. They know what they are doing, it's really great stuff!"}
{"text":"1 star because the food is actually good but I cannot ever go back there. Every single time I've been to this location it's a true test of my patience. I just waited a half an hour to pick up an online order that I arrived on time to pick up. I could go on but I can't relive what I just went through."}
{"text":"Great food! I've been eating at other locations for years. I recommend the pork salad. It's fun to watch them make the tortillas as you stand in line. The place is always packed at lunch and dinner but that's because the food is good."}
{"text":"Yum! Chipotle who? Same style but so much better! Great cilantro vinaigrette for the salad. Fire grilled chicken was so good! Lots of drinks to choose from (horchata, mint lemonade, etc). They lined the salad with a tortilla. Good, fresh REAL guac. Go early to avoid the lunch rush--they get a pretty decent crowd."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint. Barbacoa is amazing. This place is better then chipotle and better then costa vita. Tortillas are fresh and so are the ingredients. Do yourself a favor and try this place out."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Cafe Rio's food but this location is incredibly SLOW! Even during low traffic hours when there are maybe 2 people in front of you it will surprise you how long it takes to get through the line and pay for your meal.  It's incredibly frustrating. Sometimes after I'm finally sitting down eating, I'll watch others go through the line and am entertained at how long it takes them to make it through the checkout process. Almost makes me feel better knowing it doesn't just happen to me.

Aside from that complaint, I highly recommend the Sweet Barbacoa Salad. It really is to die for."}
{"text":"Extremely under staffed and slow to serve.
Everytime ive come here, there are lines that grow bigger and bigger because its under staffed and workers are moving in slow motion.
I only come here still because the food is good. But they need help running the place"}
{"text":"Their food is absolutely amazing. Here is the cons: its a little pricey! The drinks dont come with the food. Its a extra 2 dollar something per drink. Their employees dont seem to all be on the same page. Sometimes my food comes with dressing and sometimes it dont. Depends on who is there i guess. And there is this one gentleman who always seems to be in a bad mood. He makes my food with so much unhappiness i can almost taste it. Lol."}
{"text":"WARNING!! THIS PLACE IS DANGEROUS!! 

Look, I love Mexican food and yes I understand that RIo Cafe is the same concept as Chipotle and Qdoba, but according to my eyes and my taste buds, this place is waaaaaay better. And according to my wallet and my checking account waaaay more expensive too, almost double =S (hey nothing is perfect). 

First of all the tortillas are AMAZING!, they are made right there in front of your eyes, all the ingredients and fresh, and they give you so much food! I confess that I am piggy, I eat A LOT, but when I go to Rio, I never finish a meal. My favorites are the salmon salad, the nachos (hey I'm a girl still growing up haha), and the tacos. I like the barbacoa, it's just that sweet kick in that pork that I love so much! 

I have to make a confession: Yes, I agree, it is DELICIOSO to eat here, but a little too expensive for my budget, HOWEVER... I keep going back.... why?? Because they have the BEST Horchata I've ever had in my life and believe me, I have tried many horchatas in my life.... just sayin'. So go ahead!! Give it a try!!! Even if you don't want the food, go ahead and try that amazing Horchata, DELICIOSO!!  RIQUISIMO!! YUM! =)  

Ps.- If you are on a diet, don't even drive near it! Even though everything is fresh, there are a lot of calories on those yummy tacos/enchiladas...even the salads. Read the nutritional facts menu before you order if you are being healthy conscious about what you eat. (see? I care people, I care...)"}
{"text":"Best flavorful food out of all Mexican fast casual restaurant chains.  My favorite two items are the tacos and the salad.  The tacos with grilled chicken rock!  I added some of their ranch dressing and special crumble cheese to mine and they were wonderful. The taco salads are great also.  Lots of flavor.  Unlike other previous reviewers I do not need a concierge to work my way through a fast casual restaurant.  Read the website, take more than 2 minutes to read signage and ask questions if needed.  Staff is friendly sometimes a little slow in the head but I don't consider this full service.  They have daily specials unlike chipotle or Qdoba and outdoor seating options.  Check out the drink options,  amazing refreshing choices like sugar free strawberry lemonade.  Delicious"}
{"text":"My favorite taco Tuesday spot ! Shredded chicks. Tacos are my favorite . $2 tacos plus $2 for rice / beans / and a drink ! Always looking forward to Tuesday nights now . Such a calm atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Went in around 7pm hoping it wouldn't be too busy but there was a line. No big deal; but man, did the line move SSSSLLLLLOOOOWWW! After about 20 minutes, finally order, ask for vegetarian enchilada's (which, on their menu, is supposed to be beans and rice) but they only had cheese in them. The food was ok and the employee's were friendly but super rushed (kinda felt sorry for them!), however the food area looked really dirty, the lettuce was brown and wilted and not many salsa choices. Think I'll stick to Chipolte instead...."}
{"text":"To paraphrase Woody Allen, \"Such bad food, and such small portions\".

Like Chipotale/Qdobe/America's Taco Shop but not as good.

The good: Fresh tortillas

The bad: Everything else. 

Service was bizarre. Weird combination of personalized, non-personalized and uncaring. I asked for my burrito as dry as possible and they made it sopping wet. Literally dripping out the tortilla in multiple places so I had to knife-and-fork it. Pork barbacoa was unique and sounded great but was not very good -- waaaay too sweet. Going down the service line, they asked me what kind of salsa I wanted (\"none, thanks\") and proceeded to dump a bunch of cheese inside my burrito without asking:
 
\"Um, I'm sorry, but I didn't ask for cheese and can't have any\"
\"We put cheese in every burrito\"
\"You asked me what kind of menu item I wanted, what kind or rice, what kind of beans and what kind of meat, but you just put loads of cheese on everything without asking?\"
*Rolls eyes and remakes burrito and begins to fold it*
\"Excuse me, can I get lettuce in it?\"
\"It goes in the oven, so we don't put it inside (places in oven), you get lettuce on the side\"
\"But.......\"

So I can't have what I want or the way I want it. Got it.

To boot, a relatively small portion and about $1 more expensive than Chipotle/Qdoba, etc.

No thanks. I'll go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has fast become one of my favorite places to eat. Service is fast and the food is really good. Consistency isn't always the best as portions change depending on who is serving you but all and all, the food is great. Plus it's one of the few places that offers free food for the little ones. Ask for the Nino Quesadilla, it's free!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has been a family tradition for me, growing up in Utah. It was the best Mexican food around up there and I I've the taste. My favorite dish is the double pork enchilada with medium sauce (it's not spicy, I promise. Just get it) all rice and no beans. I love their cilantro lime rice, and the pork is tender and sweet. They are usually friendly, but they are making a lot of orders quickly, so I can understand them being a little abrupt. Great food as always from this chain."}
{"text":"Good food, good portions but a bit pricey if you don't have coupons. Best tortillas, great salsa. My favorite is the roast beef salad or burrito."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio currently has a buy one get one off promotion, and after reading reviews - I wasn't sure what to expect. As far as I can understand, service here is hit and miss, which is similar to what I experienced as well.

My husband and I went, because we love Mexican food, and this seemed to be a similar concept to a Chipotle. It reminds me of Chipotle crossed with Rubios, since they do offer some seafood on their menu, along with sides and desserts and more exciting beverage offerings. 

I did the salad and my husband did the burrito - we would have loved to have tried something with their seafood, because that's our favorite in general. Our recommendation is to offer fish and shrimp as an option for burritos and salads as well. 

The lady making our food was really nice and offered my husband samples of the sauces so he could get the right one for his burrito. Overall we thought the food tasted way better than Chipotle, though we still like Rubios. The portions are much larger for the price than both Rubios and Chipotle, so definitely some value here. We also appreciate not being gouged for guacamole (unlike Chipotle). 

My tomatillo salad dressing was to die for, along with the fresh made flour tortilla. My husband's enchilada style burrito looked so delicious that I might have to try that next time. I also wanted to try their chips and queso and salsa, but glad I didn't buy those as well because we were stuffed after our meal. 

The restaurant itself was very cold, far too much air conditioning for that time of day. The gentleman cashing us out is the real reason I didn't rate this review higher. He was sitting on the phone the whole time with his back to us.. I did try to get his attention but it was no use. 

We stood there a good whole 5 minutes, and quite frankly I've always been taught in customer service, that the customer in front of you takes priority over the one on the phone. Quite frankly he could have asked the person for a quick hold while he rang us through - we didn't exactly arrive at peak time either! It wasn't until another woman came back from break, that she was able to ring us through. We weren't asked if we had signed up for the the \"My Rio Rewards\" which is disappointing, but luckily I was able to scan it in by myself. 

This place could be a lot better if some minor improvements were made - like a focus on customer service, because they've got most of the food part down."}
{"text":"I just came to try this place for the first time. Got the chicken tacos and they are really good. The customer service was great, everyone was very friendly. And the place is very clean. 
So why 4 stars instead of 5?  Here's a tip for the manager/owner, don't argue with your employees in front of customers it's really unprofessional."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio was a must stop for me when in Flagstaff - so having them close by now  makes me happy.  The food is super flavorful with some great combinations. True, building and training the staff at this location has been a little challenging - but everyone is nice.  Chile Roast Beef is my fave - but have tried and enjoyed most the meats.  Try substituting the salsa fresca instead of the pico - super fresh and flavorful. The queso is amazing too!"}
{"text":"So far me and my boyfriend have ate here twice in the past two day it's delious the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is just because I don't like there sauce.
The way how to ordering is done is kinda like subway and  chipotle  But omgsh the amount of food they give you 5 times bigger servings then chipotle.
I love the shredded chicken Burrito while my be loves the steak tacos. A little pricy but for us it worth it :) also I have no idea why people are saying the staff is rude or mean both times I been in there everyone was so nice,smiling and let me take my time. I love there food I might go back today :)"}
{"text":"I almost gave up on cafe rio after a bad experience last time at a DIFFERENT location. Did not want to waste my credit I had at the place so tried a better location. SO GLAD I did because for now I will be coming here instead, it is well worth the farther drive. !!"}
{"text":"First time here....decided what to get and the line staff was less than helpful. 
1. A coworker came in behind us and they were more interested in helping him and left our tacos sitting on the grill while talking to him. 
2. I made a comment and they said \"oh\" and then let it sit there. The lady at register came and finished the meal but you were out of pico and nobody knew where any was. Then the \"manager\" said some was being made but didn't offer to get us any once it was done.
3. Then we watched the entire crew eat donuts and try the pico they just made with chips. 
4. The lady making tortillas walked out onto the floor with dough in her hand looking at someone in the parking lot.
5. The lady making tortillas walked over to the bathroom area with gloves on to use her cell phone. Then go back, eat more chips and start making tortillas again.
6. Did I mention eating donuts? Because now they are doing it again, walking around the store.
7. Trash cans are over flowing and nobody is cleaning the tables....just sitting around with nobody in line to help.
8. Now the \"manager\" is putting her hair up with gloves on.
9. Now the next shift is arriving, I can only hope this crew is better!
10. Wait, I was wrong! This employee has gloves on but putting her hair up and fixing her hairnet. Then logs in and now goes and does someone's food with the same gloves on.

The manager has no control over the employees, they run her and the restaurant.
Sometimes you wish you worked for the health department so you could write them up!"}
{"text":"Their 1st mistake is that their food was bland, even with the salsa on it.  And I'm okay with merely mildly spicy food.  Good luck in your Arizona restaurants.  Then the burrito was pretty much slopped together by uncaring employees.  Then apparently, if you get the salsa on the side they charge extra for the salsa, like $50 or $1.  I'm not sure, but this much for one tiny solo cup.  And I only found this out when checking out.  Any questions that I asked, merely raised the eire of the employees..."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place off an off for the last 2 years (whenever I crave Mexican cuisine for the most part). 99% of the time I order their burrito enchilada style and the experience has always been top notch for me. They have two signs, one at the beginning and one near the end of the line before you start selecting your meal. The signs contain a menu for the items and the prices are clearly marked. Guacamole and Sour Cream and Salsa are all clearly labeled as an upcharge so you definitely know what you are going to be charged for. Yes if you upgrade to a fire grilled steak you WILL be charged an extra $1 or so. Sometimes I have gotten away with not being charged for Pico De Galio...so I am unsure if they intend for it to be an upcharge or not. I have always been a satisfied customer when visiting Cafe Rio. If you got $10-12 to spend and you want a GUARANTEED full belly then come to Cafe Rio. Try their Tortilla Soup ;)"}
{"text":"I will say the food here is tasty, however they have a confusing menu - the photos don't match how they actually make that item - as in if you order a salad it comes out like taco but if you order the taco bowl it comes out like a salad.

Also depending on who is working they'll either give you a little dressing and charge you $1 for extra or they'll give you enough dressing you don't need to order extra.

That being said the reason I give them 2 stars, is because I was suppose to meet a friend here tonight and I actually argued in favor for this place and he drives the 25 minutes to meet me here and the place is closed - it looks like they may be having a family event but if you're making your place look like a legitimate fast food or sit-down restaurant, you can't just randomly close the place - you should put warning a week a head or just wait to do the party after hours.

If this was an employee event most places will just take the staff to another restaurant so they don't have to close their place of business and inconvenience customers.

So not only did you lose my business tonight because you were closed, you most likely lost 80% of my business as I won't ever be able to rely that you'll be open when I show up so if I come in it will be by a small chance.

I hope you learn from this."}
{"text":"This place is great !! Homemade tortillas made right in front of you while waiting in line !! Every ingredient right in front of you , so you can choose what you want  to put in your burrito or burrito bowl , enchiladas , tacos. The salsa is so fresh & tasty !! There are veggie options also . I wish they would add spicy tofu to the menu"}
{"text":"The quality of food is still good in my subsequent visits but the service has been improved. If you are going at lunch time, you may encounter a long line."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience when we went yesterday! The staff was friendly and courteous and when they found out it was our first time they made it special! Prices were good, we went on taco Tuesday and our daughter had a free quesadilla (niño) the southwest limeaid was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"They make their tortillas fresh in house and it shows! They are absolutely delicious. Also, one of the few places that doesn't charge for guac on a vegetarian item, so bonus for that. Chipotle and Subway could definitely learn something from them. Try the black beans. So good."}
{"text":"Fresh, quality food at an affordable price! I love the Mexican flavours! My husband and I ordered a take-out of Veg Enchilada and Veg Tostada. We could customize it to suit our taste, and it cost only about $8 each. It was very filling, and you don't really need any extras! But you have the option to take add-ons too! I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio has a way of turning even the worst days into great days. I always get a barbacoa pork salad, or tacos.  Additionally, the tortillas are out of this world.  Thank you Cafe Rio !!!!"}
{"text":"We went here and ordered nachos. We got steak with black beans and queso. There were a few people in line ahead of us. The lady working on our nachos said what else do you want on them?  Sour cream I said. She puts two scoops of tomatoes and no sour cream. Stop no tomatoes. You said tomatoes she said. No I didn't , sour cream. She was really rude. I told her not to worry about it we would pick them off ourselves. We paid for the nachos and picked off the tomatoes. There was not enough queso so we went back up to buy a side and the queso was out. The same lady that put the tomatoes on our nachos started yelling at another lady for not telling someone the queso was out. I guess that was why we didn't get much queso on our nachos. It was an overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Not bad, not bad. I got a salad and it was really tasty! Ordering was similar to chipotle, guac is not extra! Haha you can see them rolling tortilla dough and cooking them fresh in front of you. I got a salad and it was very decently sized! Way more than enough. I chose the shredded chicken for my meat and loved it. Hubby got the sweet pork and it was flavorful but a little too sweet. We signed up for their rewards app while in line and I'm glad we did because one of our salads was free! So that's a good little tip for the frugal families :) I just wish they had more fresh salsas to choose from, I don't consider pico de gallo an authentic salsa. They had a ranch and a lime vinegarette to choose from for the salads. I chose the latter and it was alright but would have preferred a salsa. Overall, not bad for the price. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  One of my favorites from now on.  I had their shredded pork salad and the nachos, Yummy!  =D"}
{"text":"Food is great! We ordered Taco Tuesday tacos for our office and everyone loved it. Super yummy!"}
{"text":"Their food is good, but their service is terrible. They have 10 employees working and only 2 serving customers...their line takes forever EVERY TIME I go there.  Usually it's a big social scene for the employees.  Also, they water down their soda EVERY TIME I've been there."}
{"text":"Once upon a time, this place used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I'm not sure why I never wrote a review for it, but I didn't. Unfortunately, the times have changed and I finally decided to write a review.   This place has went to the dogs in the last 3 months. What were once dedicated employees has became lazy teenagers and college students with abysmal management. The food quality has greatly suffered, and that is if they even have it to order. Case in point:   I went here on a Saturday night at 6pm last week for the Coconut Shrimp Taco special. I order the shrimp special and cashier asked \"Coconut or Cancun?\" I replied asking for coconut to which I told was sold out. Then I asked for cancun \"That's sold out too\". So why bother even asking?  But the main point is why bother having a special if its sold out before dinner time? This isn't the first time either, it's always sold out.   I had to live with my desire for a shrimp taco unfulfilled and instead ordered a grilled chicken taco \"We are sold out of that too\". Really? Just before dinner time?  Ok, then I'll order the pork \"That's sold out as well.\"   Wow, does anyone ever cook here?  I settled on the grilled steak tacos and a side of pinto beans...wait, no, they were out of pinto beans too. I had to go with black beans instead.   Finally, when I go to the drink fountain . . . you guessed it, they were out of Sprite.   Bottom line: do not go here if you want a specific item on the menu. They make everything once, and only once, and then expect it to last all day. That also makes me question how fresh anything is as well.

Update: The situation still isn't any better. I tried to go last night at 5pm and they were out of grilled chicken. Why is this place always out of food before the dinner rush even starts?"}
{"text":"Vegetarian, don't get a \"vegetarian filling\" burrito, its filled with only beans and rice then lettuce on side. The  menu says guacomole but youll get charged $2 extra for it. Get salad instead!! Les s room for error and more bang for your bucks."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite chain, fast casual Mexican food joint. My go-to: vegetarian burrito enchilada style. (I'm a vegetarian so I may be biased.) Soooo good! I love the freshness of their ingredients. They even make their tortillas on site. Their salad dressings are also really flavorful. This place makes Chipotle look like Taco Bell. The portions are also huge, so you feel like you're getting your $ worth."}
{"text":"The person helping us was miserable and unfriendly. My daughter ordered no meat or cheese so the salad was super empty. Would of been nice to throw in a little extra tomato or something. If you can, try the Tempe location. Much more generous and nicer."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio and live out in the Sierra Vista area and when we come to the Phoenix area this is a must but unfortunately this Cafe Rio is awful! The person taking our order was rude and acted like she hated to be there and the food was not fresh such a disappointment and I blame management and very unclean which is shocking because all other Cafe Rio's take pride in their stores...don't waste your money on this one"}
{"text":"This is way better than Chipotle, it's tastier and they actually make their own flour tortillas. I won't give them 5 stars because: The server seemed to be in a hurry even though there was no one behind me, the cashier talked to me in Spanish right off the bat, of course I speak Spanish, but they assumed I didn't speak English. Also, the food could be a little hotter. 

*I returned to this place, and it was good, but I think they ignore the concept of \"no tortilla\"...since they don't have a brown on their menu you have to order \"burrito, no tortilla.\" So they look at you like, \"WTH!\" Another inconvenience, or call is concern or discomfort or whatever, has to do with all restaurants that serve in this manner: They protect the food from the customers, but there's no glass on their side, I feel uncomfortable with people speaking over my food. Call me picky...ind I'm probably they only person in the world who feels this way, but it bothers me!!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely crave the pork barbecoa burrito. This place is always busy since it opened. I recommend calling in your order if you're just picking up to bypass a very long wait time."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD! I love it I love it I LOVE IT! Super friendly service, quick line, custom burritos, tacos, and salads - all sublimely delicious! Oh my lanta! The nachos are good, too. 

Also, the drinks are out of this WORLD! The hot hats and the mint limeade are my favorites, although the strawberry stevia lemonade and the hibiscus limeade were also super yummy. I've gone there just for the drinks!"}
{"text":"So I went to cafe rio today to pick up just a simple quesadilla for dinner, which takes about 5 mins tops to make. There was only a couple in front of me and about 10 people \"working\" in the back. They all kept spilling things like food and cups and plates while I was watching. The total time I was in there from start to finish took 25 mins to get just my quesadilla. The couple order 1 salad and 1 burrito, which shouldn't have taken long either but they were out of just about everything and I had to wait (after they had already cooked my food and had it sitting ready one a plate) for the cooks in the back to make more chicken and beans. And again a million people working and they could have helped me but, what ever, that's not even the worst part. Here's the bad part, when they finally finished making this mans salad they spilled it on the floor, and I kid you not, the guy making it scooped it back up and put it in the bowl for the man to take to go. The couple didn't see this happen so I said something and asked if he really was going to not make him a new salad. The kid working there pretended like nothing hit the floor. At that moment I walked out and wasted 25 mins of my life. DO NOT GO HERE. I cannot believe they have an A grade in the window. They were dirty and careless. I am disgusted."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here within the first week that it opened, so this review should be taken with a grain of salt. The decor was amazing and the drink options were pretty unique, so that was pretty cool! The line to order food was pretty disorganized, but it was within their first week so you can't fault them. Food was pretty average, chipotle has more flavoring for sure. Restaursnt was generally clean minus the employee who pushed the trash down into the trash can with her foot, which was pretty gross. Prices were comparable to similar restaurants. Overall wasn't mind blowing but wasn't terrible, worth a try if you like those type of restaurants for sure!"}
{"text":"I go to cafe rio all the time I love there food, but this time I don't think I will ever go back am so disgusted! My husband got me a burrito with the enchilada sauce on it and I took it home not paying attention I started eating it. Then when I looked down there was the biggest piece of hair I showed my husband and he tells me the people there don't wear hair caps! 

I called the restaurant and the manager was very nice and said he would give me my money back. When I went back and showed him the hair I got my money back and I saw the girl and this time she was wearing a hat! I will not go to this place again until they learn hats are not hair caps!"}
{"text":"Good, fast specialty Mexican food. You order similar to 'Some Burros' and 'Cafe Rumba', on line. Small menu but big portions regardless what you order. 

I had the shredded chicken salad with the toppings I preferred. My wife had a fire-grilled chicken burrito- which will last her three meals!  Both were hearty and very good tasting. 

We also had fresh chips, salsa and guac. Yum! Very fresh in every regards. 

They also have many drink options with sodas, horchatas, and teas. 

We were surprised, yet very pleased with their food.

One downfall: some new employees had a poor attitude, like they didn't want to be there. Not good for a business that opened three days ago!"}
{"text":"Love it great value. The salads are really good. I like the various hot sauces available too."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is addictive.  Their sweet pork (marinated in Dr Pepper I hear) is some of the best I've had.  Their tortillas are fresh and taste amazing.  Their tres leaches is fantastic and I really enjoy the horchata.  

This is a much more authentic and tasty alternative to Chipotle."}
{"text":"While the food was very good, the prices were way too high!

I had the burrito, and while it was very good and very big.... it was no better than Chipotle, so I'd save your money and head down the street!!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo delicious! Their tortillas are the bomb but on more than one occasion I've found multiple hairs intertwined with my food. .... Not a fan of that"}
{"text":"I am excited to see more of these pop up around the valley! The tortillas are made fresh and taste amazing. I love the fact that you can see the kitchen and all that is going on. This is most definitely a place that you want to go when you are hungry because the size of the burritos are enormous! I will say that it can be a little salty and a bit over powering which can have you leaving feeling more bloated than if you went to a chipotle for example. That would be the one down side. I have never gotten a fatty piece of steak or a chewy piece of chicken. It does get rather loud in the restaurant due to a empty ceiling and can make having a conversation with someone rather difficult. Other than that great place to check out it is very much like a restaurant that used to be in Scottsdale called prickly pear cafe exact same concept and tastes almost identical!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 3.5 stars. It wasn't great but it wasn't bad either.

We had a BOGO coupon so we decided to give it a try. Overall, I find the food not to have lots of flavor. Maybe if I had chosen a different item my opinion would be different.

My husband's burrito was better tasting than mine. He got BBQ chicken and red sauce. I was afraid the red sauce would be too spicy for me so I picked the mild green one and the grilled chicken burrito.

My burrito was yummy, just not very flavorful. I love to see how they make tortillas just right in from of you and the cilantro dressing for the salad was delicious.

On the other hand, they nickle and dime for things that you get for free at other places like sour cream. 

I love Chipotle but I don't think you can compare these two restaurants. I mean, the concept's the same but the food isn't. Chipotle to me seems much more simple than Cafe Rio and they also offer meat  from animals that haven't been raised with antibiotics and stuff like that.. I like Chipotle much more and you can add more toppings without paying extra.

The restaurant decoration's cute. Very colorful! I loved it and there are lots of options for drinks not just sodas. 

The staff was nice and courteous. We didn't have a problem to use our BOGO coupon and their menu offers something called \"nino quesadilla\". It's just a taco tortilla with some shredded cheddar folded in half. It's free so that's good for a little kid. My daughter ate it just fine and ate some of my dinner too.

Their bathroom wasn't very clean and there was no toilet seat covers, the soap machine wasn't working... I have a 3 year old so taking her potty to a place like that kinda grosses me out.

So overall, I'm not sure we'll be back because we have better options close by. The food's not bad. It's just not great, either."}
{"text":"I come to this location very often. I usually pick up a salad for myself and a cheese quesadilla for my 4 year old sister and take it home. Not ONCE have I had my sister with me when I have gotten food and have never had an issue. It's always after work when I pick it up and am taking it home to her. This brings me to my most recent experience. I went like I always do to get a salad. The manager, ANNA did not ask me if I wanted cheese in the bottom of my bowl but took it upon herself to grab an old tortilla that had crusty looking cheese melted on it that had clearly been sitting for awhile. She then put rice and beans on it and I told her I didn't want the cheese. So then she grabbed the salad and threw, quite dramatically and unprofessionally I might add,it behind her causing not only a huge mess but a scene. I have never experienced such disrespect before. She was then very snippy and rude and acted like my business was an inconvenience to her day. The customer service industry isn't for everyone and it was very evident that it was not ANNA's expertise. I then asked for a kid's quesadilla and ANNA said I had to have a kid present with me. This makes ABSOLUTELY NO sense. So you're telling me that mom's who have children at home and are picking food up for their families cannot purchase these quesadillas because they didn't bring all their kids with them to get a to go order? Completely ludicrous. ANNA's attitude was enough to make me never eat here again and I will be sure to tell all my friends and family about this occurance due to ANNA's incompetence and rude behavior."}
{"text":"I fiiiinally made it into Cafe Rio tonight. 

TLDR: Costa Vida is better.

I will say that they had a better drink selection and definitely deserve extra points for having crushed ice, but while the food was very similar to CV, it just didn't hit the spot for me like Costa does. 

The assembly line flow was a little rough, especially when it seemed as though they had more people back there working. At one point the employees started throwing tortilla dough at each other, glad mine was already on my plate.

Would I eat here again, yes - but not if it was between the two."}
{"text":"I m writing this review for the gilbert rd/ baseline location but it seems the complaints are similar from location to location
Their food is good but god help you if you go there when its busy like we did on friday night 10/16/14
You don't get a single second to decide what you want before they sling it in your aluminum dish. Then they slide 4-5 of the same looking burrito under the cooker with no ID to the customer. GUESS WHAT?? You get the wrong burrito and they throw your food around like its a jailhouse mess hall. I watched a female employee throw a cup of guac at the cashier who did not catch it.
Its cafeteria style and when its busy.....its a freaking zoo

So.... You get the wrong burrito and pay more at the register.  Watch out for extra anything because you'll pay for it.
Even though we had a free burrito coupon....it was a nuthouse and the employees are slinging so fast that you simply dont have time to decide anything.
So you get what you get and with 30 people single file in a long line...who's gonna listen to you??

Hey Cafe Rio- time to rethink your assembly line process and instead of upchargng for grilled steak and chicken, just have them be priced as separate burritos on your menu. Grilled meat is a mexican standard??? No???

Right now....Chipolte is my go to burrito for price and service...sorry cafe rio."}
{"text":"Best tortillas ever hands down. I feel like I'm in tortilla heaven. Especially on Tuesdays. I always attempt to eat two tacos on taco Tuesday, but always ending up eating one because it's so filling. Sweet pork mmm and their rice is so good too and limey. The perfect balance. Food coma for days! If my body allowed me to eat 100 sweet pork tacos then I would."}
{"text":"Great fresh lunch for cheap. I opted for the single taco plate ($5.99) that comes with rice and beans. It's real similar to Chipotle. Pick your style (burrito, enchilada, taco, salad, etc) then your filling (shredded chicken, beef, grilled chicken, veggie... Maybe two other choices). 

They slap a flour tortilla on the flat top grill and toss some cheese on it. It cooks till melty-goodness. Then they toss the chicken on and pico and lettuce. Choose black or pinto beans. Cilantro rice. Flavors were decent. Chipotle may have better flavors, but I can't say since this was my first time and I only had the shredded chicken. 

Taco was a really decent size, I Berniece it was a 7 inch tortilla, instead of those mini 5 inch tortillas (like at El Pollo Loco-YUMM BTW.....). 

There's was quite a lot of liquid in the bottom of my tin foil that the taco was wrapped in, liquid was from the chicken and maybe some from the pico. If I had taken it to-go, it would be soggy by the time I dug in. Since I ate there it wasn't much of a problem. 

Rice and beans were sufficiently flavored. Can't say it was AMAZEBALLS, but I also can't say they weren't flavorful. 

Trusty ol' chipotle Tabasco had my back.

Oh!! And the ice is the PERFECT ice in the world, crushes real nice and smooth. Like Sonic ice. Nom Nom. Took me a nice cup o ice to go. ;)

Overall, I will return. I'll update my review as needed."}
{"text":"Neat place, they were actually making home made corn tortillas. I had the steak burrito and my wife had a quesadilla both were good. The pico de gallo was great. Very friendly staff. We almost didn't go because of so many bad reviews. Glad we went."}
{"text":"Went to this location for Taco Tuesday, as I do every week, and always leave extremely satisfied. Huge portioned tacos, for $1.98. Too easy. If you don't go here every Tuesday, you don't know quality tacos."}
{"text":"We used Cafe Rio for an event at our office and everything was great. The order was ready right at the time we requested and the manager went over the order before we left to make sure everything was there. The food was really good, and everyone raved about the quality and taste. We ordered a Nacho Bar for 25 people and it was the perfect amount of food. Really recommend Cafe Rio for company catering, good organization of the order and high quality food provided. The only minor issue were the tongs they provided all broke. However, overall thanks for helping me make a great event for my team."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican food place. I love that Scottsdale finally has its own Cafe Rio! My \"go to\" menu item is the fire grilled steak salad. The flavors blend together to. And a delicious dish. The house dressing is a must. The lime/cilantro drink compliments the salad nicely. If you're a burrito fan you will be amazed at the size of it here. Make sure to have it enchilada style."}
{"text":"So disappointed that the had no mild sauce to make my burrito \"enchilada\" style . That is the only reason why I go there."}
{"text":"Love the food. The sweet pork is amazing but the prices are getting more and more ridiculous. It seems like they're always looking for a way to add extra fees. This last time I ordered a kids meal anticipating the kids cup but now even that costs extra.."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try this place and now I have. Not again. Came here around 9pm (they close at 10pm) while the staff behind the line was helpful, it felt like they were programmed and since toward the end of the shift, they were just working in a robotic fashion. I wanted vegan so I asked if the rice is cooked with butter the response was \"yes\" so I asked for suggestions on what other vegan options they had, the staff member suggested beans and may be salad in my burrito. So I agreed, and here is where the robotic questions kick in (remember I informed the guy I want vegan) so after getting the bread and beans with no rice next question was \"what kind of meat?\" I said \"none, I need a vegan meal\" he acknowledged and moved on then asked \"cheese?\" I said no... it was funny though. 

Drinks are sold and they give you cups and you fill it up yourself. I wanted iced tea and when I get to the fountains, they've cleaned up the iced tea dispensers so I'm stuck with soda or lemonade, if I had known there was no iced tea, I would have gotten a cup of water. Oh and all the iced tea tubs were in front of the fountains for the soda so it was a challenge to even get a drink. 

Food was average, nothing special. And oh, someone decided to clean the iced tea dispenser first, but left the trash super full, so when we left and after picking up after ourselves, the bin was so full, we had to place our plates so carefully so it wouldn't fall. 

Any how, I tried it, it was not the most pleasant experience and now I know, and you know!"}
{"text":"With all of the good Mexican choices nearby, it was a difficult choice for me to chose Café Rio last week but I thought I should try something new so I stopped in.

I wasn't sure what to expect from the outside. I wasn't sure if this was going to be a sit down restaurant or a quick service. It is kind of a combo. It is set up very much in the style of Chipolte with a menu that has a choice of burrito, tacos, quesadilla or enchiladas. The addition of enchiladas is a nice one. You can then decide which type of meat you would like. Shredded Chicken, Barbacoa (pork), Green Chilie marinated shredded beef and I think a  couple of other options. I didn't notice if they had a veggie option.

I chose the tacos on this visit. I got a two taco plate with black beans and rice. The tacos are made to order. I chose shredded chicken. The guacamole and sour cream were both extra (this irritates me at a Mexican restaurant.) The best part of the tacos were the house made tortillas. They were soft tacos which were pretty big and the tortillas were delicious! The chicken was pretty good too. They did not have hot salsa so that is a downside for me. The black beans and rice were just okay. The price is very high for this type of food in my opinion. For the two taco plate and a drink, I paid $13.87. Almost everything is an upcharge so be ready for that.

Overall I liked the food here. I am not sure if I would go here over other places nearby but I would give them another shot."}
{"text":"Very tolerable food but nothing different from Chipotle or Qdoba except I liked the drink options.  Lemonades with flavor."}
{"text":"This place is really great. Homemade tortillas, wheat, corn, or white. And man on man are they great. I don't eat many carbs but I make an exception for these! I love this place. I don't  eat meat and there are many meatless options here alone with many meat options. Chicken grilled, shreaded, pork, beef. I can account for them being any good but my boyfriend and son both enjoy the chicken. I come here about once a week. If say my only complaint is they are usually not very friendly. Sometimes after a long morning a work a friendly fave or attitude at your lunch spot can turn your day around. So would be nice to see smiles and some vetter service but the food is something I'll come back for even if the service isn't up to par.."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fast and friendly service, great quality food.

You order at the window, a bit like chipotle. I tried the tortilla soup which was AMAZING. Their shredded chicken is the base (which alone is great), then they add guac, cheese, tortilla chips, and broth over the top. Great flavor, and especially loved the cilantro on top. It comes with a fresh, warm tortilla, which was honestly the best tortilla I've had. Would love to come back! Just a warning that if you choose to get the combo meal, you will be FULL. My husband got the burrito combo meal, and man...it was huge. 

Overall, a great clean, casual place to share conversation and grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"One star is even being kind.  7PM ON A Friday. No Fired grilled chicken, no salmon tacos, no ice tea and out of specialty drinks. At least 25 people came in after us.  2 kids on serving line were goofing off and not listening to what you wanted on your food.  Then to top it off they put the forks in the container with the part you eat off being the part you grab first.  My daughter said it was a good place to eat. Guess it is if you enjoy all the above. Looks like they need better management."}
{"text":"Well, where do I start?  \"Let's start at the very beginning.  A very good place to start...\"  (Sound of Music, anyone?) 

First of all, did anyone in this company compare what $7 will buy at say, a Cafe Rio and a...Chipoltle?   Because you can eat almost 2 times at Chipoltle for what you pay at Rio...and the two times you eat at Chipoltle is four times the amount of food at Rio.

What about flavor?  I don't know.  I had enchiladas.  I got the grilled chicken (vs the shredded chicken in water in the stream table) and that upgrade alone cost me $1 more.  What's up with that?  You don't pay anymore at Chipoltle for grilled chicken...anyway, I chose the \"medium\" sauce (\"medium heat\" or \"spice\", said the grill-man/manager and in fact, there was no heat at all)  because he said it \"...had the best flavor\".  It was good.  Not great.  Barely good.  Just not $10 worth of good.  Two chicken enchiladas, rice and beans, 9.86, I think and that's not with a drink, just the enchiladas..

Second, why is the place is called Cafe RIO?  \"Rio\", as in Rio de Janeiro..., right?  Let me ask you this: WHAT DOES RIO DE JANEIRO -- IN BRAZIL, MIND YOU, what does that have to do with Mexican food?  Rio de Janeiro is precisely 4761 miles or 7660.45 kilometers from Mexico City.  Wait, what?  Why not call McDonald's \"Hawaiian Hula Burgers\"?  Why not?  Because it makes no sense.  A lot like calling a Mexican restaurant Cafe Rio...just sayin'.

I ate next door at PotBelly a couple of times, good sandwich, but this Saturday, I just FELT like enchiladas and I thought it would be as good and cheaper than Arriba across the street.  I was wrong.

My order came out of the unfriendly Quizno-like toaster, and because the single line guy was busy, my hot enchiladas just sat there.  Then, when the single line guy DID have time to prep my order, the cashier simply HAD to speak with the manager, again, while my order just sat there.  Reminded me of the same kind of neglect I see EVERY SINGLE TIME AT The Habit.  Your order just sits there.  Any competent food person could figure out a system better than no system at all!

I cannot recommend this joint for anything.  And I've seen one in Tempe or Mesa.  Website is HORRIBLE.  Can't get a menu, near as I can tell.  Some guy's mug, all ego.  The free market is hard to predict, but I'll take Carolina's or Chipoltle on a bad day over this dump."}
{"text":"If you like soggy, mediocre burritos and rude service, this is the place to go. This is the Southwest.  There are too many quality options out there to waste any time or money on this place. Go to Gadzooks or Filibertos if you're looking for some fast Mexican food."}
{"text":"So I decided to go for lunch instead of dinner because some places are better at one than the other. I will say that it was better but I would stoll only give it 3.5 overall. 

I had a chicken buritto. I will give them a solid 5 for there homeade tortillas byt the meat and veggies are just ok and lack seasoning to me."}
{"text":"First time here for me but my wife's becoming a regular so I came along. I had the pork barbacoa burrito enchilada style. Delicious. My wife likes the salads. Definitely still fast food style but very good and at least some decent decor and style. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"They are out of chicken I just came to order a salad and have to leave cuz they don't have chicken.... I just wanted a salad."}
{"text":"I saw a similar review to what I am about to write from Bill F down below and I just have to agree and say the same and add to it. 

Went there on 6/12/13 ... service is HORRIBLE. Went around 9:15 at night still 45min before closing. There are 6 people behind the counter doing work, except actually helping us out. Finally one of them decides to help us (there are two of us no one else in line) Was about the slowest process I've ever seen in my life. took us over 15 min to get through. Part of the problem was NO ONE was helping him. I asked a question about the desserts (as he was making my food) so he had to stop what he was doiong ask, go get someone, etc ... instead of her just taking the initiative.

So Service was SLOWWW.

Food was OK, above a taco bell but does that really say much?

I asked if i could have black beans with my quesadilla, apparently it doesnt come with it and I can't have that. We also bought a burrito and apparently hot sauce is an extra cost, really hot sauce?

Anyways this was my 3rd time and last time there."}
{"text":"Glad I found Cafe Rio!  Not a fan of chipotle, and there are no qdoba's here so thank you Cafe rio.  Their shredded chicken is amazing!  Burritos are always huge, usually more than you can eat.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Consider it's a knock off ate at another place the other day slightly better, but really a knock off and they don't really do it that well. One visit only and only in a pinch if there's to be a next time."}
{"text":"There was a homeless man collecting the trays on the outside tables, didn't think much of it and continued in. Took a few minutes to figure out what I wanted. We proceeded to walk up to order and the homeless man was blocking my way. He smelled like alchohol and tried talking to us. He stood there staring blocking our way until I finally said excuse me and went around him. The workers could see the whole thing!! I tell the worker the man was bothering us and pointed him out. By then the homeless man was at somebody's else table bothering them. The worker did nothing so I told him to get the manager. The manager didn't want to do anything either and tried to laugh it off. Finally she went and told him to leave a good 5 minutes later. 
Then I got charged for 3 tacos instead of 2! The charge is almost $1 for extra cheese! They put the cheese on the bottom of the taco, I want cheese on top but not for an extra dollar per taco and a song that is sung when you order extra cheese. 
On to the food.... The pork was dry and flavorless.. The barbacoa was sweet and I really don't want my tacos to taste sweet like candy.
Overall I will not return or reccomend. If I want those types of tacos I will stick to chipotle."}
{"text":"I came here to try it again for the second time and it was better than last time. I ordered the quesadilla with rice and black beans. It was ok. It needed more spiced and a kick. I was expecting food that tastes BETTER than chipotle but it was not. Where is the salsa bar!? I totally need one of these here for then it would get rated higher. The tortillas and black beans are great but not the rice or salsas. I love the fact that there is so many drink choices like Hibiscus Tea and Horchata. But it needs Mexican spice to get that authentic Mexican food taste. 

I would come back though for more of that delicious homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"I want to be Contigo!#Lets Eat! Hahaha! It's so funny, because when I was in here the Firemen were in the building!!! Like Bruno Mars \"Uptown Funk\" song says \"I'm too HOT for ya\"! Hahahaha! The firemen were ordering their food as well! Cafe Rio is \"The place\" when it comes to delicious gourmet Mexican food! It's always so fresh & flavorful! They have the best burritos! My new fav is the Green Chile pork! I got half of the green Chile pork & half of the BBQ pork with extra cheese, a little bit of pinto beans & rice, and I got it enchilada style with heavy cheese on the top!!!!#Sooo good! It was so good, I've scooped it up 2 days in a row! 

I love their refreshing limeade. The key lime pie is delicious! It tastes home-made! They were out of whip cream, & I told them I got some at house! Hahaha. 

I love how on Taco Tuesday you can get 2 tacos, beans, rice & a drink for only $5.99!#The Bomb! The tacs (short for tacos) on Tues are $1.95 each, & if you pay $1.00 more, you get beans, rice & a drink! Cool deal! 

The staff is great! I'd like to give a shout out to Ruby, Beatrice, Luke, Kristen....and everyone else! Thanks for being so Awesome & always showing Excellent customer service! I will Dance my way back in here again & again!!! :)"}
{"text":"First let me say this, I LOVE cafe rio. And tonight I was very disappointed. This location is not only rude, but they don't listen or care one bit about how they are presenting and making a customers food. Granted we came by at 9:30 (30 minutes before close) but there was no one who even greeted us or and they looked at us like we were just bothering them. 

I love their steak (pretty much the only reason I come), and the guy said he had none. Seriously? Ok so you don't want my $1.50 extra for it? I understand it's a rip off, but your loss... The quesadilla was a joke, it looked like something that a child could have put together and they didn't even cut it for us!! But of course it costs more than the burrito, with way less ingredients. 

I am NOT happy. Will not come back to this location. The one on baseline and Gilbert road is WAY better. Take your money and taste buds there!"}
{"text":"BEWARE of what add-ons you get here!  Sometimes they will let you get the basic add-ons and then other times they will sneak the add-on charges on your bill and not even bother to tell you.     
Like for instance, I order the exact same thing every single time, and sometimes my total is $9.49, sometimes it's $10.49, or $12.49. 

This has happened to me, at this establishment over 14 times (yes, I've been counting). I've been told once that I get either free beans or free rice + lettuce, pico etc, then other times I've been told that I can only pick between the lettuce, pico OR beans OR rice....like seriously Cafe Rio...you need to learn how to train your airhead employees.  This is the most disorganized establishment I have ever been to.  It's such a shame because they do have decent food, but their little \"add-on\" system is either a poorly thought out scam or the employees just like to pick which days they want to be asshats."}
{"text":"Good concept with lots of choices.  Food was a bit cool for me but I think that's just a problem with this style of restaurant.  it's hard to keep it really hot when your making it right in front of the customers from a warming table. My main problem with the place was the saltiness of the food.  While it had good flavor you usually have to add salt when out to eat.  Not here taste it first. There's plenty trust me.    Overall it was good  with a great atmosphere and nice staff. Just way to salty."}
{"text":"Hmmmm .. Ordered the shredded chicken \"salad\" and I found it difficult to even call it a salad. The base of a salad shouldn't be an enormous tortilla with melted cheese on the bottom. Just because there's lettuce on something CR doesn't classify it as a salad. This was ultimately an open face burrito. 

Now, maybe the tortilla is optional (mine was just made without an offering of choices) or yeah you don't have to eat it all or even some of it but after several bites I was searching for the lettuce and for $10 it's hard to justify a return visit for mediocre food at best. 

On the plus side; the shredded chicken, and the creamy tomatillo dressing had good flavor. CR does have more selection than a Chipotle but that can leave room for more critique as we have more things to judge. I'm not big on Chipotle either but their salad bowls with the honey dressing have the slight edge in my eyes."}
{"text":"Had the pork bbq and it was TOO sweet for me.  The only thing I liked were the flour tortillas which were freshly made, floury and warm and delicious!  Rice and beans were standard, and unfortunately I didn't get any salsa with my meal so I don't know what that's like.

I called my team's order because I was afraid of the lunch line and the order was all taken correctly for about 6 of us."}
{"text":"As far as fast casual Mexican goes, Cafe Rio is average. Though they have more options than Chipotle, and seemingly fresher ingredients, I have yet to be to a Cafe Rio where the staff has their act together.

It's either short staffing, missing ingredients, lack of initiative or like tonight, all three. And when your meal takes 45 minutes, is it really fast casual anymore? No."}
{"text":"I absolutely love cafe Rio! It's been open for quite some time and I only discovered it recently. (Thanks fellow Yelpers) This place has some amazing food, festive vibe and the kitchen is always super clean!

My go to dish is the sweet pork tacos. It's similar to BBQ pulled pork and it's always very juicy and sweet. One taco may not be enough sometimes so the grilled steak is my other favorite. Never had a bad piece of meat yet and that's rare for beef! I have them pour a little of the hot enchilada sauce on the steak taco. Yum! 

When I went for the first time I went on a Tuesday. Their taco Tuesday's special pricing brings me back in each week for my sweet pork taco fix. So far I have only tried the tacos and they're all great! 

So...I had no idea they made their own tortillas  from scratch when I first walked in.  WOW what a difference that makes!!  It's like the difference between fresh bread right out of the oven vs store bought sliced bread. Both have a right to exist, don't get me wrong, but if I'm going out to eat I'd like something I can't easily make at home myself! 

Lastly be sure to scan the barcode on your receipt to get points. (I don't have them do it at the register because it holds up the line if they can't get it to scan)  Spend $100 and you get $10 credit. You can use any amount at a time and on multiple visits until the $10 is spent. 

Buen provecho!"}
{"text":"2.5* 

I liked the fun, colorful seats and decor but I actually came for the food. There are a few things to choose from like enchiladas, burrito, taco, salad or quesadilla. There's also a kids menu and some appetizers such as nachos or just chips and salsa. It's all order down the assembly line then pay. There was very few salsas to choose from and had trouble tasting the mild and medium salsas in the burrito. The highlight was the tortilla itself. There's just pinto or black beans but I like refried.. I chose grilled chicken which I regretted as I saw the employee put it on the burrito. Yes it's white meat but it was chopped fine and looked and tasted quite dry. The rice wasn't authentic which is fine but found the burrito to be bland. I tried a bite of my husband's burrito enchilada style topped w cheese and found enchilada style was a better idea. It gave the burrito more flavor. Their sauce isn't hot either and I believe that's the \"hot\" one. I personally like burritos w sour cream, pico and guac and more flavorful salsas. But mine had none of that.

It came w a side of lettuce and pico de gallo. I thought the pico de gallo was bland too. I didnt taste much citrus at all and seemed like the tomato and onion was stirred together then served.."}
{"text":"I just finished eating my take-out dinner from CRMG on Camelback.

Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of food left, unfortunately it's in the trash can.

What I noticed behind the counter was a lot of confusion among way too many high school employees.  It looked like they opened last week, yet they opened at least 6 months ago.

I used CRMG online ordering tool.  That worked.  I ordered the beef nachos and a beef burrito.

When I dug into my nacho's I didn't like that there was barely any cheese.  Also, they seem to use cheddar which once it cools changes your nachos to NACHO.  Impossible to separate.

I gave up on the nachos quickly - no flavor and a pain to eat.  Time for the burrito.

What the burrito lacked in flavor, it made up for in size.  What flavor was there, was not what I expected.  I ordered with a medium verde salsa - which it appeared to have - but it also had some kind of enchilada sauce.  The two combined to be inedible.  I ate less than 20% of the burrito before trashcanning it.

All in all, it was a wasted $18.50

Under no circumstances can I envision a return."}
{"text":"My rating is based on the fact that as a vegetarian, they charge $8 for a small mediocre bean burrito.  Maybe if this bean burrito were exceptionally good or large in size, but it was neither.  I'm not saying that if your idea of Mexican food is Chipolte, you will not find what you are looking for and be happy here. But if what you offer your vegetarian customers is deleting the meat and not adding anything else and charging full price, I can get MUCH BETTER elsewhere and pay way less.  

GRINGOS:  Take off the Chipolte blindfolds!  Go to a real Mexican restaurant and see what real food is supposed to taste like!"}
{"text":"When Chipotle ain't cutting it (and man has it been horrible lately, goes without saying), I spend my lunch hour at Cafe Rio. I love the fact that they make their tortillas fresh in front of you, and that their barbacoa has a sweet taste to it. I also like the sauces they have out for you to take to your table and the horchata/other drink options. My only gripes are that it gets extremely busy at lunchtime (which isn't their fault--they're booming! Just means longer wait) and that the horchata runs out on a fairly consistent basis. When I ask the staff if they can refill the horchata, they look at me like I'm asking them to solve a calculus equation. With minor improvements in these areas, CR will easily be a 5-star establishment on future visits."}
{"text":"A teensy bit on the pricey side, but I do so love this place. It's like Chipotle's WAY better big brother. I love that you can get your food enchilada style. The steak is delicious! And the shredded chicken is great too!"}
{"text":"Review is based off of the staff who worked the lunch  hours on Wednesday January 3rd. What a bunch of rude people! Guy taking the order was in a huge rush when no one was behind myself or my coworkers. Practically forcing everyone to get the carne asada which was gross. Then not informing us of the price increase for that specific meat. A burrito and a drink shouldn't cost $18. I expect to pay extra for guac at Chipotle where they at least tell you and give you a hefty amount not a lick of guac thrown to the side. Want sour cream? That's extra too! Asked for a tortilla on the side and got a tostada. When I told the lady no, I wanted a flour tortilla she gave me the nastiest look and walked away. We have never been treated so badly at Cafe Rio. With so many options popping up on McDowell, this will no longer be a stop for our office. Simply don't waste your time or money. Everyone from beginning to end had a nasty attitude. People have bad days, but this was more than that."}
{"text":"Came, ordered my food, as I was waiting to pay I see the girl making the food change out the trash and not change gloves before making the next persons food.

The managers at this location aren't worth their salary, they can care less about the location and how it's ran, they're just in it to collect a paycheck."}
{"text":"First, the staff does not listen very well or really pay attention to what the customer wants. More importantly, they tend to be very unfriendly and sometimes downright obnoxious with a flippant attitude. The food is ok, somewhat flavorful and a fair variety. However, it is expensive considering the size of portions. It appears they are trying to project an image of a more upscale, authentic Chipotle. However, what it really is, a cheesy, arrogant version instead. Although Chipotle itself isn't cheap, at least the staff is friendlier and portions are larger."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken and rice burrito with extra pico de gallo and my wife ordered a chicken enchilada on line. It was ready when we arrived to pick it up. The cashier applied our online payment quickly. My chicken burrito was moist and tasty with the extra pico I ordered. The enchilada looked good but my wife didn't care for the sauce.  The chips and salsa are average. Not too much salt on the chips but the salsa had a lot of cumin. A Lot. Not a fan.  I'll be back for the chicken burrito, rice and Pico de gallo."}
{"text":"This place sucks ! Everything on the menu taste like garbage and on top of that it's over priced. The only good thing is their salad. I go there once in a blue moon but whenever I do the employees seem like they hate their job, they don't even crack a smile. Today I went in for a salad and I had a coupon which was buy one get one free, the total for both salads and no drink was 15$, it was ridiculous. I will not be coming back. They need to bring Baja Fresh back !!!!"}
{"text":"Came here Tuesday night and the lady making my boyfriends burrito had an attitude. He asked her to simply addd cheese to the top of it and she was so so rude and rolled her eyes as if it was the most complicated task. Probably won't be eating at this location for awhile."}
{"text":"Terrible. Got burrito enchilada style to go. Layers of skin on all tumblers for salsa sauces etc. tried to avoid worse looking. All drained to bottom where she had to scrape to get out. 4tables were taken by 3-5 workers sitting laughing talking etc. maybe off of work after rush. 2:30- anyways guy in back wipes sweat with hand and moves on to whatever he was doing...still staying positive. Large cup is smaller than a large. Maybe medium size. Whatever. Moved to pay. Very light on lettuce. Lettuce had few rotten pieces.  Drink stations filthy. Sticky etc. juices you can see are all drained and look horrible. Get tea I hop isn't tainted and leave. Park truck to eat. Ice cold. Sauce too sweet. Steak had two bone chips in meat. Ate a quarter of. Couldn't do it. Not good. Worse burrito.  Need to have employees not partying in main dining area. Clean every 10 min. Check m at and sauces for temp. And bones cartilage etc. need fresh lettuce and tomato. Sauce stir it! Bad experience. Went back in to explain. Girl said manager not there. Whaaat?! Okay never mind. Won't return unless fix."}
{"text":"Normally a good place to eat today I was appalled at the behavior of the manager I had a coupon and he yelled at me in line that he wasn't taking it without a barcode??! That's never been an excuse today Manager Aaron claimed that he was told to not take any coupons without a barcode he kept telling me to go to my app and get the coupon there I informed him there wasn't and he yelled at me and said to tell him please and that he would do it. Really please ? This guy clearly lacks any and all customer service and should not be in a position of manager. He has a power trip as unnoticed he was only yelling at the females working the line. A company like Cafe Rio should not employ some like Aaron."}
{"text":"I Love Cafe Rio and find myself here around once a week! I love the food and have since I was in college! However the Customer Service at the Avondale location is Terrible. Everyone is always sporting a bad attitude no matter if it's busy or slow. I try to keep to online orders but even then arrive a few minutes early or late and they give you an attitude oh and make sure you go through the bag, very often they don't read the instructions and forget something. They will act annoyed when you point it out!"}
{"text":"Pretty cool new place. My Friends Dubs and Becca H. Introduced me to this place. Apparently they are everywhere in Utah. 

I ordered the special fish tacos. One of my favourite dishes anytime I eat \"Mexican\" food. They were actually really good. Great Flavor and the tortillas were a good pair. Sides were just meh...

This place is loud. Everytime someone orders nachos the entire staff breaks into a nacho inspired rendition of Macho Man.... Its hilarious at first but in the end can be obnoxious after 10 times. Then to have to go home to a 7 year old with it stuck in his head. Not the business. 

I'd go back. My kid ate free, and that's always a plus. 

Trying something different next time. Everyone's plates looked really good."}
{"text":"Always a great experience at cafe rio. This has to become of our favorite places to eat. No matter where we are in Arizona our first thought at lunch and dinner time is Cafe Rio.  They have lots of locations and the food is always wonderful.  Their reward program is one of the best ever and we love how they offer free cheese quesadillas for our kids.  Which makes this a very affordable option for us."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant, but I was disappointed.  So, let's start with the positives:

Pros:
- Most of the people working behind the counter were very nice (pretty much everyone but 1 person was super pleasant and even funny.
- Very big portions, so if you're really hungry, this is the place.
- Fountain drinks have free refills.  
- The horchata wasn't overly sweet.  My family enjoyed this.
- Fountain drinks had not only sodas, but a couple teas, and horchata and other stuff.
- Their restaurant is prepared for large crowds to be in line.
- Menu is simple and easy to navigate in case you forget.
- Lots of tables.
- There were a couple people in the eating area cleaning up areas.
- Homemade tortillas.  This was cool.
- I like that you can get enchilada style.
- Prices were reasonable, maybe slightly more than we would spend at Chipotle.

Cons:
- One lady behind the counter attending the guacamole & sour cream was a real b****.  She was incredibly rude not just to me, but to other people.  Yes, I know the guacamole & sour cream are extra charges.  It says so on the menus.  And after I confirmed the first time I knew, when I asked for those same items on another order right after the first, you didn't have to repeat that they were extra charges with a sour face.  Chill, lady!  Yes, I know I have to pay for it and was planning on it.
- The line was super long.  And when I went to check out, the guy said this is normal and what I was experiencing was typical.  If you don't mind waiting in line, though it moves somewhat quickly, then have at it.
- Restaurant is really dark.  Maybe something in between and not so dungeon looking.
- The food was okay, but some of the food was too salty and some sort of bland.  I'm a big Chipotle fan, and Cafe Rio's food just didn't taste nowhere as good.  But, maybe it was just me because they seem to get plenty of business.

------------------------------------

The food wasn't awful, but since there are plenty of other places I do like to eat at more, only if coming here was a social thing with other people other than my family, the taste of the food just didn't appeal to me.  So, if it's just with my husband and kids, we would probably opt to go to Chipotle.  Food would be 2 stars.

Everyone minus one crabby lady was really nice, so other than her, service was good and people were pleasant.  I would give the service 4 stars."}
{"text":"Can you say Holy Burrito?! Best chicken burrito hands down. I recommend enchilada style with green sauce! Tasty and huge! I usually end up taking half of it home and eating for lunch the next day and it's just as awesome the second round. If you aren't a huge burrito fan I recommend trying the shredded chicken tacos. You can make it a meal with rice or even add a side of chips and salsa or queso. I can never get enough of the limeaid drink. There's always a line and very busy no matter what time of day, but the service is fast. Very friendly and colorful tables and chairs. They also have an app you can download and every time they scan it you are closer to earning yourself a free meal. Enjoy that burrito on your first visit! Tell them Janelle sent you...they won't know who I am, but it will be fun!"}
{"text":"We wanted to order some food here and waited about 5 minutes in line without being acknowledged as 6+ employees all stood around doing absolutely nothing. An employee finally mumbled (with his back turned to us) that he would be with us soon. He proceeded to take almost another 5 minutes while washing his hands. It was at this point that we started voicing our complaints. The manager then came out and began yelling obscenities at us. I think that it is completely unprofessional that a manager is allowed to behave like that and I will NEVER go back to a Cafe Rio ever again. We were actually turned away and the store manager refused to accept our business all because we had a complaint. I guess that Cafe Rio doesnt want our money. Hopefully the owners know that this is how the manager for this location is running/representing their business. It was at that point that she became extremey nasty and even used a racial slur. A female employee was also picking at her nose which was absolutely disgusting and against health codes. I would not trust the food at this place because it was such an unclean environment. No wonder there was not even a single customer in the store at prime dinner time (6:15pm); they probably all got chased away by the rude employees (if they were even offered service here) and they probably walked in and were ignored for 5+ minutes (just like we were) and then denied service and cursed at."}
{"text":"I ordered a quick chicken burrito and they made it right in front of me. Chicken was fresh off the grill and tortilla was handmade right in front of me. we did half red sauce and half green.

Daiel was our prep guy and he went crazy on service building me the perfect burrito.  Stephanie at the register wss friendy.

first bite was hot and perfect amount of spice.  Hates off guys to a great meal! I will be back for sure. Jim"}
{"text":"Quesadillas with steak are good, although they are a bit pricey. If it wasn't for the price I'd be here more often."}
{"text":"This is a new location for Cafe Rio. I have been a die hard fan since it opened up years ago in Gilbert off Baseline and Gilbert Rd. It is really busy so best not be starving as it will put you in a funk real quick. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the food and my fav are their salads and house dressings. Both the dressings are delish!
Now with this new location.. the parking sucks due to having way too many businesses jammed in one area. And their service line has not been fine tuned yet. They will eventually get it. My only complaint really is they are typically slammed (because the food is freaking delish!) and it takes some time to get through the line. But worth it at the end. No problems with the workers there either. They seem to be friendly."}
{"text":"Total bad meal,  did not bake cheese on shell, meat cold, wrong cheese on top, no cilantro.  , no dressing. NO bueno."}
{"text":"The food is very inconsistent.  Employee's not engaged.  My tostada was the worst. The .99 tostada at taco bell is more tasty. Vs 8.00. Asked what dressing I chose vinaigrette,  they were out. Why did she ask?  I would give zero if I could."}
{"text":"Tuesdays are always good for Tacos. Cafe Rio has good and healthy selections for tacos, burritos, tostadas, salads, quesadillas and more. At most locations, you can save $1 per Taco on Tuesday. On the Cafe Rio mobile app, you can earn about $1 for every $10 spent."}
{"text":"Good stop for a quick, relatively healthy lunch. The salad entree comes with guacamole but some entrees do not. Beware: small side of guacamole is $2.00. This location is usually extremely busy on weekdays between 11am and 1pm."}
{"text":"I really love cafe rio. Especially on Tuesdays when it's $1.95 tacos! The sweet pork tacos are amazing and have so much flavor. The tortillas are probably the best tortillas I've ever had in Arizona. The reason I give them three stars is because the staff is horrible. Maybe it's because I only ever come on Tuesdays and they're busier, but it seems like I always have the same experience. Every time I go there the staff is rude and rush you through the line- which makes it shorter but it makes it hard to decide what you want. My first visit I had no idea what to get (especially since a lot of stuff is extra) and they seemed annoying I was asking and confused. They also give you a ton of the toppings, which can be a plus for some people but when I ask for \"a little pico\" I don't want two scoops. Half the time I have to take a spoon and scoop out half of the toppings. Like I said above, I do love the food at cafe rio, but I have to prepare myself for the horrible customer service I am about to encounter."}
{"text":"Placed a phone order to go for 2 grilled chicken salads Saturday night. I was quoted 20 minutes but salads weren't ready for 33 minutes. Because I was waiting I got see our salads literally thrown together before being packaged up. When you dine in the salads look like a work of art. Not so much when you get it to go. Our salads were weak and missing components. Mine had everything but was lacking in quantity. It didn't even clear the lip of the foil pan. My husbands was missing his guacamole and only had a few crumbled remnants of tortilla strips on it.  And was also lacking in quantity of everything else. The girl preparing also put the pico on top of the strips so they were soggy when we got home. When I dine in I can't finish a salad by myself.... I ate all of this one and was still left wanting.  Disappointing experience when you spend $22 bucks for salad."}
{"text":"So my husband and I dropped in for an early dinner and I always mean to post the great experience we have every time we go there! We start off with Eunice who is all smiles and friendly and then it's onto Joanna who is super fast and to the point  then we ended with Ashley who made sure we had everything we needed! Today we were able to get a problem fixed with Tex who is the manager ...a no problem get it fixed kinda man! We enjoyed our meal as usual and loved the wonderful experience today! Thanks you guys for the wonderful service and great food you provide every time we come !! Luv luv luv Cafe Rio!!"}
{"text":"I almost went to chipotle but this place is right next to my bank that I was also visiting so I figured I'd try it. I'm impressed and not easily so. Employees were super nice, helpful and really friendly. The restaurant looks immaculately clean and my salad tastes great! (Try the pork!) Yum!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I ate here a few days ago and I love the food! I highly recommend the chicken tortilla soup. However I'm upset that this last time I went they forgot my entire family's side of tortillas and this isn't the first time it's happened too. I recommend cafe rio just make sure all of your food is there before you leave!"}
{"text":"Love this Cafe Rio! First of all, our dinner tonight was fast, fresh, delicious and affordable.  I've visited other locations previously and never wanted to return, but my husband talked me into tonight's visit and I couldn't be happier with our experience.  As a bonus, after a 700+ mile drive from San Francisco today, in my exhausted stupor, I forgot my purse and didn't realize it until we got home.  Even though the restaurant had closed a few minutes earlier at 10pm, a very nice lady answered my anxious call and reassured me that they had it, which was a great relief.  Five stars for awesome service? Good food, and awesome employees!"}
{"text":"The food is great and the portions are better than the one in Tempe. I love the Limeaid with mint and how they offer a Nino Cheese crisp for free with an entree."}
{"text":"Café Rio puts in work! 
They don't offer just any regular ol' Mexican food, this is crave-drool-drive outta your way Mexican food. 
I ordered a salad today and it's not even a regular ol' boring salad. It's cilantro and guacamole filled with the sweet barbacoa pork, so many flavors in a big ol' bowl! It'll set you back $11 but it's worth the splurge!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location they mess up my food. And It is not like it's a complicated order with any special instructions nor has it been when they are especially busy and overwhelmed with people. It's now happened enough times that I am now yelping them a bad review. If you are particularly inclined for their food, I would go to a different location."}
{"text":"I called in an order for pickup, and the person that took the order didn't put the order in to the kitchen. I was told the order would be ready by 6:45 (20 mins from the time of order) and my boyfriend showed up to pick up, and the order had not been submitted. Rather than being apologetic for the mixup, the manager on duty was very rude, and threw the food together himself, acting as though it was our fault his employee didn't submit the order. The burrito I ordered was falling apart, and the grilled chicken quesadilla was made instead with shredded chicken. It was a very simple order, nothing was as it was supposed to be, and we weren't able to eat it. We will not come back here again. Great managers can make unhappy customers happy, but bad managers can ruin a business."}
{"text":"I got the pork quesadilla and was a little disappointed in the amount of meat they have a good selection of drinks in there mint lemonade is really good! also the chips and Queso are a good side!"}
{"text":"This place has two things going for it: the variety of $1 store hot sauces to use and the mint limeade is one of the best drinks ever.  Skip soda and try it!  

I went here with friends and all I was able to get was the vegetarian burrito.  Black beans and rice.  Nothing much extra with it to add pizazz, extra filler, or even flavor.  Everyone agreed that even the meat stuff was bland and lacked something.  The hot sauces didn't save their food either but, I would go here again just for a jug of the limeade."}
{"text":"I originally started going to the Cafe Rio in Avondale. My family and myself enjoyed it. I have gone to the Chandler location twice now and both times it was bad. The first time the food wasn't very good and it looked like the same food had been sitting all day. The beans where all crusted over along with every single sauce they had. The rice was clumped together. I took it home to my family anyway and they were very disappointed. My family asked for Cafe Rio again and I thought I'd give it another shot. STUPID ME!!! This time everything looked a little fresher. I ordered a salad with steak and a quesadilla with steak. They guy asked which one I wanted steak on, I replied both. He told me no I could only have 1. I was confused so I asked why, he said we only have enough steak for 1. I told him I could wait for more steak and he replied that they won't be making any other meat for the night to just pick another one. I thought this was odd because it was 2 hours before closing time. Well I picked another meat (beef) went to the cashier to pay for it and waited and waited for my food. I asked if the quesadilla was done......they couldn't find it!!! Finally they bagged what they said was my quesadilla. I get home take the kids meal (no beans or rice), the salad (no cheese, sour cream, dressing, pico) and a quesadilla WITH CHICKEN. The lady behind me had ordered a chicken quesadilla so for what I'm gathering when they lost my quesadilla they just gave me hers. 
The food was better then last time but definitely not worth $35. Not to mention the staff was rude when I asked questions. 
I learned my lesson I will not be back to this location!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with a friend one weekday afternoon. I'd heard him talk about this place a few times as its' close to his office so I had high hopes. It's very latin themed when you walk in, bright and cheery colors. I would describe it as a closer to authentic Chipotle. They have burritos, tacos, enchiladas, etc. and you make your meat selection and choose your sides. I had the taco combo with fire grilled chicken, rice, and beans. My mouth started watering as I saw them hand making the tortillas. I paid for our meals, stopped by the drinks and got some horchata (they're selection of jugos looked great), grabbed a seat and dug in. I really liked the tacos. I've never had Chipotle's tacos but these were a mix between street tacos and your taco bell fare, and I thought they were great. The rice and beans were okay. I wish there was one closer to where I live but I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio just isn't up to par for Mexican food.  I ordered 3 tacos with steak/guac and a small drink, total $14!  Seriously, way over priced tacos for so little. The tortillas may be homemade but I can get tortillas just as good or better at other Mexican food establishments.  I had asked if I could get cheese on the top of the tacos, it would've cost extra.  You got to be kidding me!  The lettuce was poorly cut, huge pieces that makes it hard to eat it in a taco or even a salad.  Really messy prep area and the staff pretty much lazy about how they prepared the tacos and other guests meals.  People were not that friendly nor seemed to like their jobs.  Good location to be in, yet not worth the trip."}
{"text":"HOLY WOW !!! Never eaten there before until last week and man oh man wow! I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food but the next time I crave it, this is the place I'm going to! 

Ordered a steak burrito with only rice, beans, guac and cheese and what I got was outstanding, huge and plenty tasty! 

Given the amount of other Mexican themed places in the area that have all really let me down (Raul and Teresa's, Arriba and the worst Chipotle) this was a very welcomed experience! Not to mention filing up here before hitting Costo's probably saved me 100 bucks, you know that they say, eat before you shop!!! 

About the only negative, EXPENSIVE!!! 

Excellent can't say that enough."}
{"text":"The sweet pork burrito was great. I've had the steak salad, which was also good. Consider sharing since portion sizes are huge. They seem to do much better when it isn't busy. It's located in a strip mall, so ambiance isn't the best. It has a chipotle feel to it with cafeteria style serving, concrete floors, etc. pretty typical prices for fast casual."}
{"text":"Came in near 2pm on a Wednesday. My order of the shredded beef burrito felt rushed. The man at the counter asked me what kind of meat I wanted and if I wanted cheese then automatically threw my order in the toaster. What if I didn't want my burrito toasted dude? I wanted to add pico and lettuce in my burrito which I had to get on the side but since the burrito was already assembled it was hard to include my now side items into my already assembled burrito. Kind of disappointed since they'd like to replace their competitor but are not able to provide a consistent customer experience."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty!! Came here for lunch but the line was horrendous so instead I grabbed a table, ordered my meal over the phone and then walked to the take-out area and got my food fast. Kind of cheating but it was a brilliant idea! And it worked! I love Costa Vida and the sweet pork at Cafe Rio is identical so I loved it. Prices are definitely way too high so I wouldn't come often but if I'm craving it then it's a win. Service was friendly and the restaurant was clean."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rios food. For fast food it is the best. The ingredients are very fresh and the flavors are amazing! The reason it doesn't get a higher score is because of the service.  Every time I walk in there are three or four employees at the register area on their cell phones or talking. No one ever greets you. Then go in line to order and again rarely does anyone say hi. They just make your order. Then you go out to sit down and the tables are dirty. They have time to sit around and talk but not enough time to clean things up. I am not just rating this on one visit.  I eat here alot.  Anyway, at least the food is good, right?"}
{"text":"My feelings about Cafe Rio turned dubious when I saw prices higher than Chipotle or Qdoba, with fewer meat choices (no carnitas!). The dubiousness doubled down when  I got a look at the fixings.

It was a long look, as the large staff seemed utterly uninclined to wait on me. After a long while, one gal pointed me out to another, who smiled at her coworker and went back to whatever she was doing with the grill. At this point, I gave up and left.

The idea that checking off store tasks is way more important than waiting on customers probably comes from management, so I'm not going to blame the very young and probably inexperienced staff. But if it's your business model to figure that customers can damned well wait until somebody gets around to them and there's no hurry or need to even acknowledge them waiting, then you'd best be either way cheaper or way better quality than your competition. There is no reason I'd give Cafe Rio a second chance.

I went to one of the other restaurants in the same strip and had a very nice experience there."}
{"text":"I have been here 2 times and this was the better of the two. Both times I got a chicken salad with the tortilla, beans, shredded chicken, lettuce, pico, and guac. The first time, the lettuce was not shredded very well and there were huge leaves, making it really tough to eat. The second time it was much better. I don't like how they put the beans down first; I have to dig for them and then there are a bunch on the very bottom after I've eaten all the lettuce and chicken. The food is pretty fresh, but the drink area and sitting area are kind of a disaster. Could definitely do more to enhance the ambiance. But like I said, pretty fresh, fast, healthy and does the trick."}
{"text":"My supervisor recommended Cafe Rio because he and his family love going to the location by their house. I got the pork salad. I like it. It's a BIG salad that definitely leaves you full. The restaurant was busy so I'm glad I ordered ahead online. The only drawback I had was the pork had kind of a sweet taste to it, but I still enjoyed"}
{"text":"This place is the greatest. Food is great. The energy is fantastic. Everyone working there looks happy to be there because they're always having a great time. Today I had someone help me out who was learning for the first time and his coworkers were so nice and encouraging. I was very happy and will go back any day."}
{"text":"Food is good but it is sooo hot in there. It leaves me no desire to eat there with it being so hot in that restaurant. Management if you see this something needs to be done. My friends and I have both noticed and said we won't be going back. You are losing business."}
{"text":"It sucks.  Guy making the burrito refused to put pico and lettuce in the burrito.  I know how it goes normally, but refuse?  That's just strange.


Update:  It tastes like a brick of salt!

DO NOT GO HERE"}
{"text":"Like a lot of reviewers here, I have to agree.   The staff really does not have their act together at all.  

The flour tortillas are homemade and the best part of the meal.  The specialty pork has a soda marinade which is really sweet, and its like honey that gets all over your hands.  And its not good, its just sweet.  

This is a place if you are hungry and close by it would be ok.  If you are not in a hurry.  I definitely would not set this up as a destination stop.  They have serious issues to fix."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fast food with a sit down dinner feel. Staff is super friendly and the food tastes like real Mexican but not greasy and heavy like other places. Get the tres leches cake!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, I am a fan.
I like tacos, I like cheap tacos, and I like to not have to talk to a lot of people when I am hungry. This place fits my needs.

I enjoy the warm fresh tortilla's.

I don't ever get my phone to get a good signal in this place though. Not saying it's their fault, just a fact. Sucks. 

My suggestion is to NOT go at the lunch rush (especially on Tuesday's)
When I say rush, I mean 30-40 people waiting in line in front of you. So if you are really hungry it will be a wait, even if they go as fast as they can."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The Mexican food is made fresh everyday and the food is high quality. There is no reason to rate this place less then 5 stars unless you're too cheap to pay a little extra for guacamole. I definitely recommend this place and one of the best Mexican food places in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This cafe rio is a little stingy with their portions and there is just not that much love in this place."}
{"text":"Omg this is my favorite Mexican place and favorite cafe rio in town!!!!! Love the employees here as well!!"}
{"text":"I work close to this location and they had Cafe Rio cater lunch. It was amazing. Best catered lunch I've had in a long time. The chicken, rice, tortillas, salsa, guac, pico, salad.... everything was BOMB. I recently downloaded the app and can't wait to try it. I hope I am not disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place. The hot salsa (fresco?) is not SUPER spicy but spicy enough to please me. I love all the fresh ingredients. I always get the roast beef tacos, and their corn tortillas are to die for. I don't think this place is anything like Chipotle, like the other reviewers say, it offers slightly more authentic Mexican food (AND Horchata, YAY!)
Now that they have a rewards program we go all the time. I highly, highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Café Rio is your average Mormon gathering spot for halfway decent \"Mexican\" food, but it's nothing new and in my opinion doesn't trump Costa Vida or Chipotle by any means. It's your standard wait in line, black or pinto beans, what kinda meat (sweet pork obviously), yada yada yada. The biggest difference (and my biggest problem) with this specific Café Rio is the time spent in line. During my last visit, I didn't move more than a foot for almost 10 min. The attitude on the serving line was pretty lackadaisical, and it looked like it may have been greenie training day because orders were being mixed up, ingredient containers were empty (hence the long wait until supplies were replenished), and there was just a general lack of hustle or even concern, I guess? Perhaps my impatience was quickened by my hunger but I ended up leaving the line and went to Firehouse Subs across the plaza. I had eaten at that Café Rio before multiple times, but every time I finally get to the cashier to pay after a grueling wait and stiffened knees, I catch myself thinking, \"I could have driven across town to Costa Vida, eaten it, mastered the violin and returned here by now\"."}
{"text":"I don't do this very often, but Cafe Rio you're on my sht list. Keep not paying attention, and wrecking my order. Three times I have been given the wrong order, in the last month. It's a simple matter of, 'you only have one job\". Listen. That's it. Love the food. Awful service. All the way down the line."}
{"text":"So I was in Vegas on business and my client took me to eat here (at the Vegas location).  It was awesome!  When I got back to AZ i Googled them to find a location close to me.  Well there are none that are really close to me, but I went out of my way to eat here and show this place to my wife.  For some reason it was not as good as the location in Vegas but it was still very good. Whenever I am in their neck of the woods I will hit it up."}
{"text":"I hate beating down on large franchised establishment because I'm sure it's a struggle to run one and deal with the large volume of customers on the daily. However, they usually seem to do OK and do damn well at serving their purpose -- you want something a step up from McDonalds, yet not have to dress up and go sit down somewhere with waiter service. 

Cafe Rio is particularly bad. Their food service station is an absolute mess. They somehow still messed up our order after being corrected twice, probably something to do with their bizarre and disorganized grill situation. None of the veggies looked appetizing. Most disappointing of all, you can't even say you're getting a decent taco because the whole thing is soaked in red, translucent grease and you can't really taste much else.

Look elsewhere for a decent meal."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a quick, easy option like cafe rio. Keeping it health with a fire chicken salad still satisfies the taste buds."}
{"text":"Solid place if you're looking for a good meal that is cooked to order. Located in a strip mall, quiality food and customer service, plenty of on-site parking. You walk through a section and order your meal while they prepare it in front of you. Enjoyed their attention to detail. Liked the grilled steak burrito, loved their hot sauce, and liked the amount of space in the seating area. Liked it enough to return a few days later, knew what I was getting and they delivered it just as well. Limited atmosphere, storefront with plenty of tables."}
{"text":"I have NEVER had such a terrible experience as I did tonight at Cafe Rio. My son like the large cheese quesadilla, and he doesn't get anything else but tortilla and cheese. No rice no beans no meat, nada not even a garnish!!! They have always since the start of Cafe Rio (and I am old and went to their first store in Utah) only ever charged us a nominal amount like $3.50 or so. Tonight they insisted that the cost was $8.49. I had this girl manager be super short and flippant with me and make a scene about it. Very poor customer service today, I am completely appalled. I so can't wait till Costa Vida opens up, they know how to treat customers."}
{"text":"I've eaten here about three times now, and I have to say I'm a fan. I've eaten at their location in Gilbert several times before, so I knew what to expect when walking in.

The place is colorfully decorated, with different colored tables and chairs of all sizes for seating.  Their food is cooked fresh, they will make what you want to order on or off the menu.  I usually go with the shredded beef taco with some kind of beans and rice.  This is a hearty meal, and let me tell you, its filling and delicious. I love their shredded beef, as its really moist and juicy. Their tortilla's are made fresh by hand, and you can watch them  make it as your standing in line.

Overall I love this place, but at times, I feel rushed through line. I also have a hard time hearing the guys behind the counter when they ask me stuff like what I want on my taco.  Honestly, I know my hearing is good, so I think its the noise from behind the counter that drowns them out.  I have to ask them a lot to repeat themselves, and its not that they aren't loud enough....but in between the glass that's separating you and the noise from the kitchen, I have to keep saying \"HUH? ONE MORE TIME PLEASE.\"

Also, sometimes i feel rushed at the register when i pay. I take my time and put my money back in my wallet and make sure I have everything before I take my tray, and sometimes I feel like they want me to hurry up so they can keep the line down, and not have it pile up.  (I know, fussy, right?)  LOL

Overall, I love their food here and I really enjoy eating here. I plan on coming back in the future to eat more, and even though its on the pricier size, I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"4 stars only because I hate waiting in line. Offset by great fresh food at a very fair price. I had the grilled chicken salad. Fantastic. Highly recommend. Sofas only though."}
{"text":"Sloooooowwwwwwwwwwww

Did I mention that they are slow

Good is usually good.  Team members are usually stressed out.  How is this location such a problem when others are awesome"}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I've ever had in a cafe rio and I don't even know if I want to eat my food after seeing the conditions in there. 

First off I love cafe rio. It's one of my favorite restaurants and I actually worked at one years ago in Utah where the chain started I believe?  I drove out of my way to go here because it's my birthday and all I wanted was cafe rio. 

What I got was not cafe rio. The culture of cafe rio was not there at all and the cleanliness of the place was bad. It's a brand new store so how can it be dirty? It's not! The employees all had horrible habits that they had no problem sharing with the whole restaurant. Let me break it down. 

Walked in, no greeting, ok that's forgivable I'm not a secret shopper. Standing in line the lady making tortillas was extremely nice and sweet and the only person in the store that I had a good experience with so I wanted to point that out. 

Once I started ordering is where it all fell off. The kid taking our order had a look on his face like I just peed on his shoe, but it didn't really brother me until he rolled his eyes when my girlfriend order a kids quesadilla. She wasn't really hungry but wanted to try Cafe Rio. I had never taken her here and I doubt she will ever want to come again. 

After we ruined the burrito rollers day it was time to witness the worst salad girl in the history of salad girls. Seriously this one needs to be addressed because it's a health issue. She was dropping all sorts of cups into the containers and putting them back with the others like nothing. The sour cream was covered in lettuce and my girlfriend got all sorts of random lettuce in her side of it. I get it that stuff spills into them but it shouldn't spill into guests cups. The worst thing she did was she kept scoping pieces of tomatoes and random stuff that fell out onto the counter back into all the containers. 

Also I ordered extra meat, do you guys not call that out anymore? I had to yell extra meat when I worked there, you can too. It made it fun. This was anything but fun. 

The lady who checked us out was just rude. We were just a number. Just a card to swipe. She didn't even hardly look at us. I was reaching out for the card and the receipt and she handed them to no one both times because she wasn't even looking at us. 

I'm so incredibly disappointed. This is one of my favorite restaurants. I really hope this isn't all trickling down from the top and it's the ownership not pushing the culture and putting correct expectations on employees but idk what else could be going on, because no one in that store is was acting like they worked at cafe rio. I will happily go to the location in chandler next time."}
{"text":"I love options. I'm the kind of person that when I have chicken strips, I want 4 different dipping sauces.

This place fulfills my need for options in a way that their competitors can't.

The menu is a little confusing, and the daily specials board doesn't have prices or explain that it includes a drink.

I had the special, the chicken tostada salad, a tostada with rice and beans, piled with romaine, chicken, pico de gallo, a dollop of sour cream, tortilla strips, and some dressing that tasted EXACTLY like the jalapeno ranch I covered everything with at Chuy's when I lived in Texas. 

I also ordered chips and queso, which came with a pretty good salsa and more pico.

Drinks! Vanilla coke! Horchata! Tea and lemonade! (See what I mean about options?)

Everything is served in foil \"to-go\" containers, with lids on the condiment bar for easy transport.

Next time I go I think I'll try one of the tortillas they seem so proud of. 

Oh, and visit their website and click \"I don't care\" down toward the bottom. You'll thank me."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Horchata is horrible, tastes gritty like it was made from a powdered mix.  

Portions good, enchilada style burro was tasty; however, I should have been told that I would be charged the same price for a cheese only quesadilla as a quesadilla with beef or chicken upon ordering not at checkout.  I paid $8 for a cheese crisp. Very pricey and not offered any options until it was too late.  

But/for the cheese crisp issue, I would return.  Being treated dishonestly and hoodwinked leaves a bad taste.  No mas Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Cafe Rio. I was so excited to sit down and eat my tacos but was soon disappointed. Within the 3 minutes it took me to get my drink and sit down both my tortillas were completely soggy and gross. I couldn't even enjoy my tacos cause all the ingredients kept falling out of the ripped soggy tortillas. Very upset with the way it turned out. I will say that the sweet pork was super delicious but doesn't excuse the sogginess."}
{"text":"Shock & Awe.

It must be in their business model somewhere. You'll be shocked when you get up to the register and $12+ for a simple chicken salad with a tortilla. And once the shock value wears off and you finally take a bite of your salad you will be in awe that you didn't pay half the price elsewhere for a better salad. The only thing that was enjoyable about the salad was the cilantro vinaigrette (which by the way when I asked for an extra side I was given two options. \"Do you want the $.50 or $1.00 extra?\" How about this is an $11.50 salad and an extra side of dressing is the lube before I get violated in exchange for some romaine lettuce?"}
{"text":"My family has been a fan of Cafe Rio for years. The food is delicious and we enjoy everything on the menu. However, I have not enjoyed the customer service since this location has opened. One night in particular was especially bad when my family came in to eat. I ordered a pork salad, as always, and the salad was completely drenched with an inch of water from the recently washed lettuce. I'm glad it was washed lettuce...but my salad was drenched and pretty disgusting.  I took the salad back and received so much grief from one of the employees saying he did not see what the problem was. I asked to speak with someone else and he walked away outwardly groaning and rolling his eyes. Unbelievable! Finally someone kinder offered a new salad, but even after this I had to wait 30 minutes for a new salad to be made. I had to get up four different times to ask if my salad was ready and the employee seemed to forget each time to pass on that a new salad had to be made. This was an extremely disappointing experience. I know not every experience is going to be absolutely perfect, and I am more disappointed in the unkind employee that rolled his eyes at me. I will always be a Cafe Rio fan, but this was very upsetting!"}
{"text":"Five stars for their food. Zero stars for their customer service. I guess that averages to about a 3 star place. It's not just one location that has awful customer service, it's literally every place I've tried from Chandler, Tempe, Scottsdale and now Tolleson. They all have one thing in common and that is the \"death stare\" they give you anytime you ask for something. Also the fact that nobody ever says \"you're welcome\" or \"have a nice day\" or any simple phrase that should just be common sense to use when working in the food industry."}
{"text":"I ordered the tostada and it was basically a pretty salad with tostado chips in it. I tried their pork burrito and is wasn't too great either. The horchata was good though. And the staff were very kind. It was a nice place but I don't think I'll come back here again, very underwhelming \"Mexican food.\""}
{"text":"Food was ok, had to ask staff multiple times in order to get my order correct. Items are very pricey, burritos are definitely huge, but probably not worth a second visit"}
{"text":"I'm really surprised Cafe Rio has low ratings. I thought it wasn't bad. I went here because my friend is gluten free and she had a BOGO. It's more of a Tex-mex, not authentic Mexican food but it's pretty good for what it's for. The portions are huge and very filling I couldn't finish my food, but I'm happy I have left overs for the next day hehe"}
{"text":"Food is fresh, but service is slow & facilities are dirty.  With Smashburger, MOD, & Kneaders nearby, there's no need to stop at Rio."}
{"text":"The kid cashier was horrible! I asked him a question on how much something was.. He stated.. Don't ask me... I don't know pricing !!!! I said.. You are the cashier!!!!!! He got pissed at me !!!! Immature and needs to be fired! Horrible customer service! 
.. Food great.. But watch them .. Like to be very stingy on what they give u!!!!"}
{"text":"First off I have to say, great location and I love that on Friday night at 7pm there is plenty of seating! The atmosphere is fantastic and very authentic. Lights and decor that definitely match the food you're eating.

The staff are very friendly and it would appear perhaps the manager is right in the line making food with the rest of the employees which is a good sign of a well run place.

The kitchen is immaculate, I mean, very clean. Which is hugely impressive for a fast food place.

The prices are very reasonable and they make their tortillas fresh, on the spot! Very cool. I had a chicken burrito enchilada style and it was fantastic!

Great experience, I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We love Cafe Rio we love their salads and their burrito's. They are the best and very filling. They have great customer service if you have an issue with anything you email them and get a response back in no time. I will wait in line when it is super busy or order on line and it is always ready when I get their, this by far is my favorite place to go for Mexican Food."}
{"text":"Americanised Mexican food \ chipotle restraunt. I honestly don't like a lot of the stuff on the menu,I only prefer the taco shrimp Saturday special.its delicious! The quesadillas are very good with grilled meat and chicken only.but truthfully in my opinion this isn't a real Mexican restaurant and it sucks. Id pick filibertos anytime over cafe Rio american food.just because you add cilantro doesn't mean its Mexican food lol  anyways the tortillas are bomb by the way and that's about the only thing that's worth tasting."}
{"text":"Shocking service and food. Should have left when I walked in.  Did not get better. How can you not make basic Mexican food??"}
{"text":"Thankful that this location is open and close by.  The burritos and the chicken salad is what we usually get and it's just perfect for satisfying that hunger.  Watching them cook the food is always fun for me to watch, but on top of it..the food is very good..the chicken is seasoned perfect and very juicy..must try"}
{"text":"Shocked by the low star rating of cafe rio! My friend recommended this place to me and I now have a slight addiction. I got the shredded chicken salad bowl, without pico, without beans, and white rice! Amazing! The bowl is wrapped in an amazing fresh tortilla and filled with a mouthful of goodness! I highly recommend this place and look forward to coming back! Way better than chipotle, qdoba, rubios, and so on!"}
{"text":"Cafe Rio is a close match to an Authentic Mexican Restaurant. 

I came here for taco Tuesday, $1.95 tacos, $2 for a side of rice and beans. They offer a large variety of ingredients that you can add to your tacos. Tortillas are flour and fairly large compared to the corn tortillas at Chipotle. The steak was very flavorful and cut to medium sized strips. The barbacoa was a little too sweet and very wet, making the tortilla nearly rip but was still good. Chicken had good flavor and wasn't dry. 

Pinto beans are good, rice not so much. 

They offer a ton of hot sauces and fresh fruit waters (aguas frescas) as well as flavor shots. 

Atmosphere is low lit and colorful, making it feel like a cantina. This place might be the new spot for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Solid little restaurant. Had the fresh tostada salad with fire grilled chicken for 5bucks. The meal was large enough for two. Start with an oversize tortilla, choice of beans, romaine lettuce, pico de gallo, tortilla strips, sour cream, cilantro lime vinaigrette dressing. It's a good place."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio & their food, but this location is terrible. They recently renovated which is a plus. My husband refuses to go here because it's dirty. The cashier seems the be the only person to do the cleaning and restocking, but they never have down time. So every time we have been the trash cans have been full, the tables dirty, and napkins and utensils are always waiting to be stocked. It's so bad that they leave boxes of utensils and napkins out so that customers can refill them. The floors are always covered in trash as well. I wish this location could find a manager that cares or maybe have a person dedicated to cleaning and restocking."}
{"text":"Horrible food, horrible service. Trash can is over flowing. This is absolutely disgusting! On the positive note, the tortilla was pretty good."}
{"text":"Would the owner/operator please step in and take care of your business! You may want VALERIA to go through training again. This young lady made our food and was quite rude I felt like I was in a soup line and like I was being an inconvenience to her for being there. She threw the ingredients in the tin like she didn't want to be there when I ask her a question she literally just stared at me answered and rolled her eyes! WOW!!!!! It seemed like she didn't want to be there and honestly she shouldn't have been. The cashier Alejandrin was pleasant and when I ask for a survey card she actually took initiative and went and found a prior receipt with the information for me. The restaurant had 2 other tables dining other than my family and 4 employees including a manager and the dining room was a mess. Mr. or Ms. Owner we know that no one can run your business like you do but anyone can run it into the ground. Word of mouth travels fast... I've eaten at the Cafe Rio location in Scottsdale several times and even the food at the Avondale location wasn't as tasty. Then again it could have been the girl making it, over kill on the red/enchilada/ sauce ruined the burrito. My daughter got the quesadilla took one bite and threw the rest in the garbage. My husband said Chipotle would have been a better choice. I honest believe it was the location. We won't be back..."}
{"text":"Top reasons to go: Great drink bar with horchata and some other interesting options. Tortillas are good. Steak was tasty. Ingredients nice.

Reasons not to go: Overpriced and nickel and dimes you for everything. Food is decent, but not exclusive. And parking in this center is awful.

Used a BOGO for a steak burrito ($9.50), got a kids meal ($5.99) and 2 drinks and the bill was still $22. For that price, I can go get sit down Mexican and a better carne asada burrito 2 miles away."}
{"text":"Settled on this place since Snooze was packed. This place is average at best. 

Their sweet pork burrito was overly sweet, didn't let you enjoy the pork or anything else in it. That item gets 2 out of 5 stars. The grilled chicken tacos were leaving you wanting more flavor. Yeah, the lettuce mix was leafy and crunchy but the Pico de Gallo wasn't up to par. The last thing we tried were the chicken enchiladas and they were just okay. But, at least the chicken wasn't dry. But the sad part was that there wasn't any guacamole to be had.

The service was just okay, nothing special. The young man that made the food was polite and the young lady at the register was also polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Whenever our valiant Firefighters locate a place to dine - you can
be rest assured that the place is top shelf. This healthy Mexican fast foot joint has all fresh ingredients, staff is hospitable, & the food tastes quite good. I have been there MANY times before - & it seems as if the next time is always better than previous trips. Do check out this dynamic healthy Mexican food establishment!"}
{"text":"Where to begin.. 

Well first we go in and it has just recently opened so I'm going to try to give them the benefit of the doubt.. So me and my father are in Line waiting to order and a woman comes up and says \"what's your favorite here?\" To which we reply \"oh it's actually our first time\" so she yells out \"FIRST TIMERRRRR!!!\" And the rest of the staff yells that as well and it was a bit embarrassing but I understand it's a gimmick so I went along. 

NEXT: I go to order a vegetarian burrito, and keep in mind everything is laid out and you choose what you want JUST like chipotle, so the guy goes to throw cheese and enchilada style just assuming that's what I wanted and I had to tell him \"no none of that either please\" so then I get to the part where they put the Lettuce, tomato, etc and before I can put anything IN my burrito the guy puts pinto beans on TOP of the burrito then puts it through a cooker and I say \"oh I wasn't done building the burrito\" and he replies \"you actually get it all on the side and put it on yourself..\" So I get the salsa, lettuce, and \"one free scoop of guacamole\" on the SIDE which is already annoying because any Mexican food place I go to ESPECIALLY where you build it there the stuff goes IN the burrito so there is no hassle and the woman says \"you have to ask in advance for us to put it on for you\"

NEXT: my dad gets a chicken quesadilla which is literally a kids size, and when I go to pay I also add 2 drinks, and the woman says \"since that's a kids size I can only sell you a kids size drink...\" Are you kidding me???? Not to mention no one said it was a kids size, he asked just for a chicken Quesadilla and that's what they give him? I guess you have to ask in advance for a regular size? And as we go to sit down the woman behind us with a distraught look on her face passes us at the drink station and says \"wow why does this Place have to be so confusing?!\" 

FINALLY: we sit down and at this point I need a SECOND plate just to build my own burrito (litterally) and when I go to pick it up, the salsa liquid got UNDER the burrito causing it to be soggy and it literally breaks apart all over the place and turns to mush.. At this point I asked for a refund so I could leave and as I'm waiting for the money back the woman from earlier who yelled \"first timerrrr\" asked me how it wAs, and when I said I got a refund she replies \"you should have got it enchilada style like I said...\" Keep in mind I did take a bite before refunding and I will tell you it is the exact same spitting image of chipotle... Just more exspensive and more of a hassle and a lesser size of a burrito... Just go to chipotle across the street and save yourself a headache and a bad dining experience."}
{"text":"I love the food at Cafe Rio...but this review is for their online ordering service and general customer service. It was terrible! I don't think I'll ever order online again. Not only was my food cold, but it was terribly assembled, my chicken enchilada had barely anything inside of it and half the order was missing. I guess it's part my fault for not checking while there, but you just trust that they're going to make it correctly. :(

Sad state of affairs - lost a lot of respect for Cafe Rio today. It seems they pay even less attention to guests' online orders than they do to guests who are ordering in-store. :("}
{"text":"Just had lunch here at Cafe Rio. I ordered the taco meal. Youu get to choose your own meat and I chose shredded chicken breast. The meal comes with a tiny bit of rice and beans. They are not generous with the sides.  The signs claims that the food is natural from scratch.  Kind of like Chipotle. What's cool is that a lady is making tortillas from scratch. I think this place is okay, worth trying."}
{"text":"3 words: blah, blah, and blah. Food is bland. Staff demeanor was poor. Would go back only for the homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"Food was good and the price was great but I'm not a big fan of the cafeteria style dining.  When you get your order, it comes in this metal dog bowl looking dish on a traditional cafeteria plastic tray... yuck.  

Why can't they just bring your order to you in a nicer dish?"}
{"text":"Good spot for lunch

My work crew is a big fan of Cafe Rio for lunch. Line takes a tad long, but the staff is cool, they nailed the order, and the food is actually tasty.  Never a fan of staff singing.  In this case though, they actually seemed to be having fun with it.  Oh, note that the parking lot can be somewhat crazy.

As an experience, I'd compare this straight up with a Chipotle or Qdoba, but with more cheese and less cost.  Lunch specials are a good value.  Decor is enjoyable and cleanliness was good.  

Extra star for the staff's really good attitude and the pride they were showing in their city. I liked seeing the Avondale gear while they smiled, joked, and filled our orders.

We'll likely keep this as one of our go-to places."}
{"text":"I love cafe rio, but this location is horrible. Called for takeout and said over 2 hour wait! This place is always short on staff. I drive an extra 10 miles to chose a different location."}
{"text":"great food and fresh tortillas made daily."}
{"text":"I have been a HUGE fan of Cafe Rio and went to the Gilbert location many many times when I lived in the East Valley.  I would actually drive more than 10 miles each way to get there I enjoyed it so much.  

Once I heard they were opening a location on my new end of town I was thrilled to say the least.  It was going to be my new regular place to go for Mexican food each week.  

Well......that is not exactly the way it turned out. 

I've been 3 times since they opened and have had identical experiences each time so I write this review in confidence that I did not simply just catch them on a bad day.  

Each time the line to get through was painfully slow.  The last time there were about 10 people in front of us and it took more than 20 minutes (yes I timed it) for us to be served.  I'm not amused by their singing in the least.  That does not show me that the staff is enjoying their shift.  In fact, they seemed stressed,  grumpy, and less than enthusiastic about interacting with customers.  

I'm willing to bet a big reason for that is the fact that they were understaffed each time.  Only 2 people working the front line?  Come on Cafe Rio. You guys are too busy to only have 2 people up front on the make line.  They did not have a runner refilling the bins either; not surprising that they were out of nearly everything.  Hey management/ownership, you are stressing your workers out and aggravating your customers by making us wait that long.  

Once we navigated the line and survived the slow service, we get to the end where we were asked if we wanted guacamole on our nachos.  They only had a tiny bit left, and they put that on top.  We looked at them and said, is that all you have?  We were told they would bring some more out soon.  When we slid over to the register and the girl at the register said that was the normal amount and if we wanted any more it would be an additional charge. So, they charged the $2.50 (or so) for it and said they would bring it out to us.  

By this point we are bugged and not enjoying our experience and were discussing how cheap they have become nickel and diming people.  In this case, an extra $2.50.  then they brought us out a little 2 oz cup of guacamole.  $2.50 for that?  Hardly....we took it back inside and got our money back for that.  I know food is not cheap and good food really is not cheap, but come on, stop being so chincy, CR. 

I've just noticed the meat portions have become smaller, the prices have gone up, the service has gone south, and now we are no longer loyal customers."}
{"text":"It would've been nice to know the gross rice and beans cost extra before they were thrown sloppily all over my plate. The food is just average and I regret not eating at the taco bell next door."}
{"text":"The food is amazeballs. I love their tacos and the Tuesday specials. The app lets you preorder and earn rewards for free food. It gets hectic busy during lunch and often line is out the door. I do recommend using the app to pre order and pick it up either to go or to eat there. I don't like many crowds and the tables with chairs are kinda snug put together. People have a hard time getting out of there dodging sitting areas. The freshly made tortillas and soft tacos are made in front of you while you're in line waiting to order, I love it. There have been times when I pre ordered online and my food still wasn't ready in time because they got really busy. The food is totally worth it though. Love this place"}
{"text":"The food is good. I love the sweet pork. They always give nice portions for the price. However, they always seem to run out of queso. I paid for it prior to them informing me they were out. The wait time is 15 minutes for another batch. So now my burrito is dying becoming cold and the lettuce wilted and they don't seem to care. The staff does offer guacamole as if it's the same as queso. The fact that this isn't the first time it's happened is what makes it so frustrating. They need better prep and better customer service. I'm not sure how you completely run out of an item that's directly in front of you. They definitely need better communication. Oh and take out the trash please."}
{"text":"I am beyond excited that this new location is open! I LOVE Cafe Rio! I went in on opening night and they were doing a great job keeping up with the long line. I will be back often! It's almost a bad thing that I work right across the street.. Almost :)"}
{"text":"I use to go to Cafe Rio when I lived in Utah and it was a favorite. So needless to say I was real excited when I found out one opened 6 blocks from my house! My favorite is the enchilada plate with sweet pork and medium sauce. I don't like rice and beans but they will give you lettuce, pico, and sour cream in place of that. Make sure to get a stamp card at the end to earn a free meal! 
The main reason I didn't go 5 stars is because sometimes the staff get a little sassy when they don't need to be and won't listen to what you're trying to tell them before interrupting you. Food rocks though :)"}
{"text":"My wife and noticed this place had recently opened and wanted to try it out.

At first I was pleased because it's possible to order a burrito enchilada style.  I ordered it with the pork.  When they asked for my sauce preference (mild, medium or hot), I chose medium.  The medium sauce was a chunky green sauce.  They put some cheese on it and put it through their little oven.

When I tasted it, I was very disappointed.  First, the pork is overly sweet.  It's like honey barbecue sweet, emphasis on \"honey.\"  Second, the medium green sauce has no spiciness to it.  I went back and asked for a small cup of the red sauce which they called \"hot\" to put on my burrito.  The red sauce isn't that spicy and would probably qualify as mild at most other places.

Overall, my lunch was a big disappointment.  I likely won't go back.

Rather than give 1 star, I'm giving 2 stars because my wife liked the taco shells for her 2 tacos, although she found the pork to be way too sweet."}
{"text":"We go here about once a week for a grilled chicken salad. Normally it's pretty good, but the last two times have been pretty bad. We order online. So the order shouldnt get messed up. Two weeks ago, half the order was way wrong and didn't notice until we got home. Last Sunday was not much different, but this time half chicken was rubbery as hell and some was burned so bad I threw it away. 

Note to Cafe Rio: consistancy in a restraunt is paramount!!! There are many choices for Mexican food and one in this same shopping center. You need a better free on Sundays if you want people to come back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.. I'm super picky when it comes to Mexican food but thy won my heart over."}
{"text":"This Cafe Rio location is the worst. In fact, Cafe Rio is a shell of its former self. I was a faithfully Cafe Rio supporter while living in Utah over 10 years ago. They food was great, dinning area always clean and the staff knew their stuff. Always fast and efficient. Now it's the complete opposite. I don't think I'll ever come back to Cafe Rio. This location is filthy. Old food sitting on the tables while employees eat. Nothing wiped down or clean. I got a steak salad and a soda (almost $14). They skimped of the steak and the salad was super watery. Just didn't taste good. The lady working the line was struggling. Didn't even use the tongs to put the chips on top of the salad or the cheese. Just reached in with her hand. Glove was on but she didn't know what she was doing. Not happy and seemed bored. Unfortunately I've have similar experiences at Cafe Rio the last couple of year. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Very tasty food, on the pricey side. Nice employees, clean facility and comfortable. WAY BETTER THAN CHIPOTLE."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and ended up trying the green (mild sauce) enchilada dinner. In addition to enchiladas they have burritos, tacos and salad bowls. Corn and flour tortillas are made from scratch in-house in front of you - pretty cool. The corn tortillas used for my enchiladas were amazing. The green sauce (mild) was well seasoned and blended great with the shredded cheese and chicken. The rice was undercooked but I could tell it was seasoned just right. I got refried beans instead of black beans and they were cooked to perfection. They don't have refried beans here. Drink options are Coke products, different kinds of teas and Mexican Favorites like Horchata and Jamaica. 

I'll come back when I'm looking for a quick Mexican meal. Friendly and fast service."}
{"text":"Delicious and fast! What more do you want? :) I always get the tostada with a soft tortilla"}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio but I hadn't been in for awhile because I had it catered for a party (which was awesome!) and I was eating the leftovers for several weeks (froze and reheated), so I had to get through all of that first. Asked for a shredded chicken burrito with rice, black beans, mild sauce, and cheese, but I didn't notice until she was rolling it up that she put grilled chicken, so she had to throw out that burrito and make another one... Oops! Guess I should have been paying closer attention. Meal was free since we had enough rewards points. The iced tea was out so my friend let one of the employees know and she refilled it right away. When it was ready she even offered to fill up our cups for us. What a nice lady! My burrito was delicious and made me very happy."}
{"text":"Love cafe rio for taco Tuesdays.  The barbacoa. Pork is the best. It's a wonderful sweet sauce. The chicken can be dry. Everyone gives the best service with a smile and you get your hot food quickly
. They heat a little cheese on the homemade tortilla made right in front of you. The salad dressing is amazing and a tiny bit spicy and  creamy at the same time. The plethora of drinks are fruity. U can help yourself and make any combo u want as well as diet coke and such. I can never finish my salad it's always full of good stuff just the way I want it."}
{"text":"After a disasterous experience at this franchise last week, i was credited a gratuity and decided to give them a second shot. Instead of the tempe location, we went to camelback and 20th location around 8pm on Sunday. 

It was pleasant to still see fresh food being made and an energetic crew. The server was vibrant and clearly explained all of my options. The food was fresh and the tortillas were still warm. The final product look like a magazine example; a complete 180 from the bottom of the pan meat i was served. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"This place is so yummy. Best sweet pork burrito in town. I swear to you. Nice Chipotle competition."}
{"text":"This place is way better than Chipotle hands down. Real, fresh tortillas that are made in front of you. Delicious and flavorful rice and sauces. It. Is a fast food restaurant so don't expect wonders. I would pick this over Chipotle any day though"}
{"text":"The food was not inedible but I did not enjoy it.  Even if something is a \"3\" star place, I'll still finish what I've bought, but I didn't even finish this.

I ordered enchiladas with roasted chicken.  They came with rice (which looked fantatic) and choice of beans (I chose pinto).  I got excited at the prospect of Limeaid to drink.

The food had no flavor.  There was a slight initial taste of lime in the rice that was never repeated.  There was not a hint of spice anywhere in any of the foods, salsas, or anything.  Even the limeaid was 2nd rate.

I will not suggest a return trip."}
{"text":"Yeah.. I'll stick with chipotle, at least they are honest and upfront about what they charge, unlike Cafe Rio."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with cafe rio. I've eaten cafe rio probably over a hundred times in my life. Their food is always consistently great. This location, however,  is usually packed and I've just had back luck with staff on ordering pick up over the phone. My order was wrong a few times, but they corrected it just fine."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The cashier was a little behind and each employee serving the food was yelling to the next customer that was 5 people down the line. I had to repeat what I wanted 5 times. I have never seen more rude employees anywhere. I honestly felt like they hate their jobs and were treating us like dirt. Store was dirty and the line was out the door. Food is marginal. If you like  extremely Americanized Mexican food, poor service and a dirty atmosphere packet full of people with horrible parking you will like it. You would think that they would put an employee on the second register and get people through but they don't. Workers are talking about random things to each other and saying they want to go home right in front of the customers. I did see 2 employees who were nice and polite but the other 3 I dealt with were complete jerks."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and very hearty portions. I love their sweet barbacoa on just about everything. Their taco Tuesday is absolutely not to miss! You can't beat their $2 tacos - super yummy! Just a tip. Their app is giving away free stuff when you sign up. I got a free drink and my fiancé got $10 off his order."}
{"text":"I would give this place 0 star is there was an option to do that.  The food here is just ehh! Is basically a wannabe Chipotle.  I want to say the best thing was the soda, but i can get that at the Circle K for 89 cents.  This place is WAY overpriced. Lunch for 2 people get ready to pay $25 for two.  I think is funny that they say the food price if under $10. Lies!  The service was worst than going to Mcdonald's the person who took the order looked like she was annoyed and was like anything else tapping her finger on the table \"How Rude\".  Over all you know this place is not worth it when it came to pay i saw the price $24.50 and even the employee was like.  I would never eat here, the food is great but not worth the price and is way to expensive.  That says a lot!  We eat and left and will never come back."}
{"text":"I like this location a lot. I've been here a few times and also had ordered online to pick up in person. The service is alright, sometimes when there is a line it can move slower than expected but that's alright, things happen! The customer service could be better, I've never had a bad experience here just sometimes the employees don't really look happy to be working. The food is always good though which is a plus!"}
{"text":"So, corporate finally responds to one of my emails from 5 months ago with a curt apology and offer me a free meal. Yeah, no. How about a refund from the last 6-8 terrible meals and equally horrid service. 

I don't miss you Cafe Rio!"}
{"text":"Don't order online and pick up. Just go in. My boyfriend just picked up our food after ordering online and the order is wrong,  it's missing all the pico and lettuce and good side stuff we asked for and my food is COLD. I'm super disappointed because I love the barbocoa burritos."}
{"text":"I love this place, it is a tad bit pricey, but you do get a ton of food so it's worth it. I would definitely recommend getting a stamp card and using it each time so you get a meal after the 10th time/meal.  Plus we used a bogo free coupon earlier and got a ton of food for a little under $10. Food quality is top notch every time. Love the drink selection. Great staff, never had a problem. I don't eat here all the time, but I love it when I do!"}
{"text":"This location of Cafe Rio is below standard. Every time we go there the kitchen area is so dirty, with food splattered all outside of the containers. The service is SLOW. We have walked in when there were only 3 people in line and 6 employees and they took forever to make our order. They just waste time and are not efficient. Their guacamole was visibly brown and they still served it. We have gotten take out and they always forget to put an item in our bag.  Although I like the food at Café Río, the cleanliness and service is horrible so can only give it a 1 star."}
{"text":"Currently having the worst experience I've ever had at Cafe Rio. The line was incredibly slow and the employees seemed to not even care (or notice??). The person putting the meals together didn't know what he was doing and the crew seemed to just be goofing off. The line was almost out the door! On top of that, every table was dirty and the floor was disgusting. Giving 2 stars because my food tastes yummy but other than that this has been a bad experience! Loud ringing noise (phone??) nobody answered the whole time I was in line and on top of that a guy was using a power drill on one of the posts of the line!! What????


Update: 10 hours later and I'm still annoyed telling my husband about lunch today so changed to 1 star."}
{"text":"LOVE Cafe Rio. After living in St George, UTah, we were very happy to see one here in Arizona. The food is awesome and is freshly prepared. Love the soda station with all of the selections. This location is one our favorites as it is close to home and it reminds us of Utah."}
{"text":"I had a char grilled chicken single taco platter for $5.99. $1.50 extra for char grilled chicken. I guess grilling is so much more expensive than... It came with rice and beans.  Looked like about 2oz of chicken were on the tortilla, which was more than enough because the chicken was so dry I couldn't eat it. It was like chicken leather. pretty sure it wasn't grilled that day. $6.49 for a taco rice and beans that were inedible. I guess the $1.50 extra is to cover all the extra gas they use to ruin chicken on the grill.

Obviously they don't pay attention or care what they are serving people."}
{"text":"Love this place. I take my friends and employees here all the time. Customer service is great and humorous. Food is awesome. Priced right. Just need a few more options. Can't complain even over that. Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"Service here is awful!! Tonight I went in and they were totally or of chicken and would not be making more even though they would still be open for another hour and a half. Then I waited for over 10 min to be checked out because A staff member was on a personal phone call at the phone across from the register and would not help me or check me out. My receipt says her name was Alejandrin and when she finally came to check me out she was still on the phone. Very unprofessional and for what this food costs you think you would get decent service. No thank you cafe rios, I will stick with chipotle who will not only make more chicken but they are always happy for my business and provide good service. Don't waste the money here!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the food at Café Rio!  I first found them when I was living in St. George UT, and was excited to find out that they were opening this store so close to my current location.
My Favorite:  Chicken Burrito, rice, pinto beans, medium sauce, sour cream inside, enchilada style! 
If you are nearby, give it a try...you'll LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Service has become horrible at this place! Todays date..May 31st, 2013 at 8:16pm. I usually go about 5-6 times a month to this location in particular and have noticed it going downhill. Finally this last experience inspired me to write my first Yelp review. Two people in front of me and it took twenty minutes to get through the line. They only ordered one dish each so it's not like I was behind a football team or something. 

Kid behind the counter was as inefficient as I've ever seen plus looked stoned. Eyes half shut and glazed over. He struggled to put together each meal. African American kid.. All smiles and chatty but to the staff talking and talking to the girl sweeping the floor while the lines just stacking up behind me. 

Management didn't do a thing.. Most of the people were in back slicing and dicing oblivious to the front. Finally I get my time consuming order 3 tacos. Lol. It's been carried around the kitchen, half forgotten on the grill. 

Now it's time for checkout. Standing at the register for 5-10 min.. What appears to be a manager rolls past me to grab a drink at the soda machine. Starts chatting up the girl restocking the lids at the soda fountain who I later find out is my cashier.. After they joke around for awhile he rolls back past me and heads back to slicing and dicing in back. 

Cashier finally comes up.. No sorry for waiting nothing.. Asks me what I had, I reply chicken tacos and ask for a drink. She runs my card, bags the food and walks away.. No have a nice day not a word. 

I'm home now.. Live less than a mile away started writing after finishing 3 luke warm bland tacos.  Probably not going back. Until they upgrade their staff.  

One more thing... Get rid of the singing.. It's demeaning to your staff. I'm sure they don't make a ton of money and to have them drone out some half hearted song about cheese or a new customer is revolting.  And really...after waiting for the length of time it would take to wrap up a meal at a fine dining restaurant.... Do you think my moods going to improve with the staff taking time out to sing?? It only perpetuates the situation. Putting a little more feeling behind the droning isn't going to be the solution either.

Definitely need to train your current staff to kick in when there's a wait or higher some new people. I'd get rid of whomever the manager was... Ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time ordering online from here. Ordered 1 salad and 1 burrito. The salad was completely wrong. I order shredded chicken salad with no flour tortilla, no rice, no cheese, black beans, extra pico and a side corn tortilla. I got shredded chicken salad with flour tortilla, rice, pinto beans, cheese, no pico. I paid extra for sour cream and extra black beans on the burrito and they didn't add either. I called in and Rachel answered. She was sweet and apologized, said they are training new people. Don't know how hard it is to read a screen and put some ingredients together...She said  to mention her name and we'd get a free meal next time. She was very kind and my fiancé thought his still food tasted good otherwise prob would of given a one star. Such a bummer after a long day and trying to just pick up dinner!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving a star is because the food is good... The staff however is so rude. They consistently mess up to go orders it's almost a guarantee. 
If you'd like to speak to the manager don't waist your time she is as rude as her staff."}
{"text":"For whatever reason, last night, I had a HUGE craving for some Cafe Rio Barbacoa Nachos.  I have only had them twice before so I don't know why/how this strong craving came about.  Granted, the nachos are freaking delicious and are definitely some of the best nachos I have ever had.  Still, it's a random craving to have out of nowhere.   I Yelped Cafe Rio and found out that there was one semi close to my house.  Guess where I went to lunch today?  Yup........nacho, nacho man......I want to be, a nacho man!

Rolled down here and got in line and placed my order for my pork barbacoa nachos.  Whenever you order nachos, the staff sings the nacho man song.  Its pretty funny yet a bit uncomfortable to hear all of them bust out a tune while making your food.  Anyways.......I got mine topped with  all the usual stuff (pico, guacamole, sour cream, cheese, black beans,  Dr. Pepper soaked pork barbocoa).   Total for nachos and a drink was a little over $11.50.  Here is how they were.................

Pork Barbacoa Nachos-  These things are possibly the best order of nachos out there.  They pile a grip of tortilla chips into a little tin foil container.  They then top your chips with a grip of cheese and meat of your choice.  They send it through a little conveyor belt to melt the cheese and then load it up with the other toppings mentioned in my previous paragraph ;-).  Everything works well.  The sweetness of the pork barbacoa, the crispy chips, the stringy cheese and the heartiness of the black beans all blend together perfectly.  They are a bit skimp on the guacamole and sour cream but they still give you enough to mix it around a bit.  Overall, they are just excellent nachos...some of the best nachos I have ever had.  Oh yeah, they serve Coke products which is sweet!  

Once again, I was very impressed.  I have not had anything else from here, and doubt I will ever get anything else from here besides the nachos.  Stick with a winner, right?  These nachos are fantastic and are a must order every single time!  Trust me ;-)"}
{"text":"Second time eating here, and I felt I needed to give a review with all the bad reviews. 
I love this place. I'm addicted. 
I used to really like chipotle but their continued push towards non-sustainable GMO and there general downward spiral of quality have made me fall out of favor. Even chipotle on a good day isn't half as good as cafe rio.
They tortillas are fresh here, and wow does that make a huge difference. 
Whenever I'd get chicken or pork and chipotle too, it would always have big globs of fat. 
And cafe rio, they have shredded chicken breast, and I'm not sure if it's because it's all white meat or just better quality control but I haven't gotten big globs of fat. 
AND they have the option of enchilada style. Immediately better. 
And this is the first place I've found where I prefer the red sauce over the green. 
Only down sides 
1) when they run out of stuff, they don't seem to make more. It was later in the evening though, so it's not completely out of the ordinary. 
2) their chips aren't as good as chipotle. They're really cheap, stale, store bought in taste."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. It's all about the sweet pork and the steak. I also recommend the mint lemonade. I'm not crazy about the chicken."}
{"text":"Can you guys please use like half to 1/4 the salt you are currently using???
Your food is WAAAAAAY too salty!"}
{"text":"I will start by saying the food was as expected. My salad with pork was fresh and delicious. I was a little caught off guard by the to Go order hostess \"ATO 2\" She was very short with us and lacked customer empathy. My friend thought he had entered the \"free drink\" code online but upon arrival and receiving food he noticed that it did not work. Instead of offering a free drink, since the offer applies to all online orders, the hostess responded with \"you'll need to buy a drink.\" Not, \"I'm sorry\" or \"I really wish I could honor it but I can't\" 

I also realized after opening my dressing I got the wrong one. I went up to the front to ask for the other dressing and she said she wouldn't be able to give me the other dressing unless i exchange mine. I don't know who in the world would want an opened, touched dressing. 

This lady needs a lesson is customer service because with someone like that behind the counter you'll sure be driving people out the door."}
{"text":"First time here, chipotle and rubios is deff better.. My chicken was burnt food was over priced $37 for 2 burritos and employees seemed confused and annoyed (learn to smile)..Not a fan"}
{"text":"So let men start by saying the food is good at Cafe Rio. However, today when I went in for take out the customer service I received compelled me to write this review. While my order was being prepared the cashier and food preparer proceeded to talk across the customers about a party they were wanting to go to tonight, to the point that they couldn't talk and work at the same time delaying processing my order. Yes, not professional but I can let that slide, they're young. While I was driving home my order tipped over so I pulled over to make sure my order didn't spill out in my car. I noticed the tortillas I ordered on the side for my tacos were not in the bag. I drove back to get them. What comes next is mind blowing to me. When I walked in to ask for my tortillas, the cashier proceeded to tell me they were in the bag. She then called over to the food preparer that she was talking about going to the party with and asked him about the tortillas. He said that I would need to bring in the bag so that they could look through it. As if I'm lying to score two extra tortillas? I went back out to my car and brought in the bag. She went through the bag and saw no said tortillas. Instead of apologizing and getting me my tortillas, she proceeded to argue with me that she knows she put them in there and that they must be in my car. Seriously?!? She was defiant that she put them in there. It wasn't until I asked her \"why are you arguing with me over two tortillas.\" \"I am not lying to you to get two extra tortillas.\" \"Can you please get me two tortillas.\" She reluctantly asked the same food preparer to get me two tortillas. Apparently customer service is not a priority at Cafe Rio, but those tortillas that cost them pennies to make are. If management reads this and cares you can figure out the employees in question as I was there at approximately 2:30 on Saturday, October 29th."}
{"text":"National Taco Day - busy at Cafe Rio today but they still moved us through quickly and quality meal!!  Good service, good food, clean!!"}
{"text":"I had the bean and cheese burrito. It was not flavorful and was rather salty - and I slat and pepper almost everything. The queso side for the chips was also salty, a little sweet, and overall underwhelming. The tortillas are fresh made and probably the best pare of the meal. 

 service was quick and the dining are serviceable if not super comfortable. Family friendly and fairly busy so people seem to like this place. I wouldn't make it a regular spot. Chipotle is superior in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great as usual. This time I got the red sauce and I enjoyed it better than the tomatillo sauce on my burrito. It was so big I had to save half for later. Very tasty and reasonably priced. Definitely recommend this restaurant. My first time at this location and I like it better than the Baseline location.  Fresh and fast."}
{"text":"This place is great. Each time I visit the Phoenix area, I have to stop in... preferably on \"Taco Tuesdays\". Their pork is killer!"}
{"text":"Their food isn't bad, but you can't say you're open until 10pm and someone shows up at 9:20pm to locked doors with customers still sitting in there and staff in the background. 

I called and she said \"we closed early\". I didn't realize this was a mom and pop operation."}
{"text":"We went for lunch today,  I had the chile roast beef taco  with rice and pinto beans. I like how they made the tortillas fresh in front of you.  The meat had a great flavor. The rice and beans were nothing to write home about.  While we were ordering I saw the group in front of us ordering chicken and beef nachos.  Those looked delicious,  I wish I would of gotten those.  For every nacho order that is placed the whole crew will sing \"nacho nacho man\" song. Javier got the Chile beef burrito enchilada style.  He said it was a little small but that thing looked huge. The taste of it was really good.  It's a little different then chipotle, which I'm getting tired of anyways.  I will be going back soon for those nachos."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but maybe I had my hopes set too high. It was clean and the employees were friendly but the food really lacked for me. I definitely did  not feel like it was fresh and delicious. It felt like heavy smothered mexican food. It was salty and the shredded chicken was greasy to top it off. I doubt quite seriously that we will return. I would much rather have Chipotle."}
{"text":"Today was my third time going to Cafe Rio. This was strike 3. I have gone back to give them a chance because their food is pretty good, but I am done. The staff is very rude. The ordering process is very confusing and they are so rushed that I feel like I cant ask any questions so I just keep my order as simple as possible. Today, I asked for a side of guacamole since it is on the menu. The lady serving me asked if I wanted it on the burrito and I said no. Then she put my burrito to the side and continued helping the people behind me. I also told the cashier I had asked for a side of guac so she called out for it. The first lady walked over to her coworker and both were looking at me like I'm asking for something crazy. She finally said they don't have any and looked away. Just poor customer service. I am a restaurant manager and I would never hire those people. Not sure if bad service is part of the culture for Cafe Rio or just this location."}
{"text":"I love it. I went two days in a row! Both times had the vegetarian tacos with black beans. I can't wait to try their quesadillas. You must have the mint lineage to drink. The food is super fast and much better than anything I've had at Chipotle."}
{"text":"Our family loves Café Rio. This review has nothing to do with the food (which is great), but everything to do with the service. We had placed an online order that was to be picked up at a specific time. When we arrived, precisely at that specified time, we were told that the order was not ready. I waited and watched as several other online orders were filled, despite having shown up after me. 45 min later, (yes, 45 min later!!) we were given our food. I could have stood in line 2-3 times and still gotten our food faster. Needless to say, we will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Really good and really fresh.  A bit hard to find tucked in beside Costco but glad I found the place.  I had a vegetarian salad and loved it."}
{"text":"Loved everything about the tacos, especially the sweet pulled pork. Fresh handmade tortillas also taste delectable. If I had any drawbacks it would be that they are sort of stingy with toppings/sauces. Otherwise you are best advised to come here on Taco Tuesdays for $1.50 tacos and buy a lot of them! Sweet pulled pork is out of this world!"}
{"text":"Bad service, rude staff. 

Came in 10:55, everything was ready to serve but the rude waitress said \"we open in 5 mins\" and turned back\" 
Ok, I walked out and did some shopping and came back around 11:30 and same waitress who served my salad, completely rude like I owed her 100 bucks. This is the worst cafe rio locations I have ever been to in terms of service and work ethics. They deserve a 0 star if that is one to be given. No wonder they get this crappy review overall. 

Shame on you sucka, if you do not to know how to be a good server, then do not work!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the staff that is working tonight. I asked for extra meat, and did not receive extra meat. Then I was charged for double beans when I did not ask for double beans. The girl asked if I would like beans only and I said yes. Double never came out of her mouth. Then when I asked the man working the register to clarify my order he did not give me the \"Taco Tuesday\" special even though I had explained that was what I had wanted. My food was on the grill for about 30 seconds which resulted in half melted cheese and the meat still cold. Then I asked for chips and salsa and never received them. Over all what should have cost me just a few dollars turned into about $18..."}
{"text":"I have loved cafe Rio ever since I was in college in UT and was so excited about their arrival in the Arizona years ago. When they first moved to the valley I it was exactly as I remembered it: prompt and fast service, friendly and fun employees, with yells of \"First Time\" and \"Free Meal\". Even if the line was out the door I never waited much longer than 15 min to get through the line and pay. I have noticed a trend in all the Cafe Rio's over the last two years. The employees all look like they are being held captive and hate working there. They no longer are fast moving through the line, despite there being short lines when I have been. The drink bar and restaurants appear dirty. And I see people standing around. 
The last time I went I ordered online through the app. I ordered at 7:30 and was given a pick up time of 8:00. More than ample time to make mine and my wife's salads. I arrived at 8:00 and had to wait until 8:20 to get my order. While i waited I observed workers standing around or not helping out behind the counter. 
I think the only reason people and myself keep coming back is because the food is still dang good! That's the only reason this is two stars and not one. I'm not sure it's worth the hassle anymore to go in. In the future I might just continue to order online or go to Costa Vida."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is so worth it. The ingredients are fresh and I love the stevia lemonade. So I love cafe rio food! Thank you for existing! Best Mexican food!"}
{"text":"First and foremost I would like to state how much I really love this place. I love the vibe of this place as well as the staff that are amazing , except for 1 staff member when I was there this pasted Saturday 12/17/16, I came in and started to place a order to go. The Hispanic woman with a thick accent could not get my request right and then when I asked her again nicely I requested he red sauce not the mild green looking sauce on top of my burrito , she has the nerve to roll her eyes at me and speak to me rudely. I would have let it all go if she had not rolled her eyes at me , that to me is a sign of disrespect. I said \" Wait , did she just roll her eyes at me or did I am just seeing things ? \" , the lady right behind me stated \" Yes honey , she rolled her eyes at you , that is not cool \". I requested to see the manager, I got two . They were both very nice and sweet , I told them what had happened and why I was upset . Karen , one of the managers , was so apologetic and could not believe one of her employees did to . I only requested that the Mexican lady and I pointed to her , that she not touch my food for fear she would do something to my food, Karen said she would personally make it and she did. Karen the manager went way and above the call of duty for me and made me again believe in Christmas magic, overall human dignity and kindness. For that Karen, I will pay it forward in your honor Karen for being so sweet with me and showing me that you do care about your valuable customers. THANK YOU KAREN --- YOU ARE A ANGEL ,, I promise , I will be back ........"}
{"text":"This could be a 5 star for me but honestly its been months since they have been opened and they have yet figured out a way to keep the line flowing. My suggestion is to use the other register and put no reserving seat signs like Zuppas. I can hardly ever find a seat after i order my food and half the people in it dont have thier food yet. I know that its quality food everything is fresh but when waiting over 30 mins or long in line kinda turns you off! 
Beside that i loveeeee the food here!! Unfortunately i dont come as often as i would like for the reasons above."}
{"text":"Im sorry but I rather go back to the chipotle I got ecoli from. I am a major fan of a place called costa vida but the drive is awful. I was told to try this place and my husband had to go in my place since I am doing chemo. He goes in and I am on the phone with him telling him what I want to order. The lady didnt acknowledge him at all, and ignored him as he ordered. I wanted sweet pork and chicken and she put just chicken on it, and when he said and sweet pork, she rolled her eyes, and said nothing but muttered something to the cashier. He wasnt paying attention and when he brings the food back here I look at the receipt and it was 18$ for a goddamn burrito!!!!!!!!!! Why? Because the charged us extra for the meat (chipotle and costa vida dont it called half and half), then charged for the GREY COLORED guac that I literally couldnt choke down, and extra for rice and beans(comes with your meal at costa vida) the Cilantro lime rice was brown/grey, and had no taste of cilantro or lime, and I ended up throwing out my entire plate after a few bites. Then that evening BOTH my husband and I were extremely sick. Thanks but we will never come back here."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times in the past. I really enjoyed the food, when it wasn't too much trouble for the staff to build it the way I like it, which I do not make very difficult.

Since Baja Fresh closed I have been searching for a carne asada Burrito and par with them. I thought Cafe Rio was going to be it, and just based on the food it would have been. Problem is, one of employees needs to put it together. My order is always basic, a carne asada with steak, cheese, beans and rice enchilada style, no pico, no lettuce. Instead of the pico and lettuce I ask them to put chips on the side of the burrito with red sauce and cheese along with the burrito. Seems pretty simple right, I thought so, but the staff seems to hate replacing pico/lettuce with chips because man, they get irritated. 

One time, I guess the guy (tall dude, bad attitude) thought he would be funny, instead of chips he put strips, the ones you add to tortilla soup. Other times I was told that is not how they do it, which I understood and even offered to pay more for, though for what I wasn't sure, the chips I guess, but I was willing to none-the-less. 

I kept giving this place a chance, but each time my order was met with resistance, or simply made wrong, likely on purpose. Too bad since this is right around the corner from my house. I miss Baja Fresh, hopefully the new Costa Vita across the street will be better."}
{"text":"Usually no problems when I've eaten at Cafe Rio except at this particular location. When I was paying for my Taco Meal I tried handing my punch card to the cashier who told me he couldn't punch it for taco meals. I asked why and he shrugged his shoulders and said, \"I don't know. I guess because it's one of the cheaper meals.\" If there are rules behind the whole punch card thing you might want to consider enlightening the cashiers because this kid didn't have a clue."}
{"text":"It was my first time here, so I had to figure out ordering.  It's kind of like Chipotle style ordering, but with not so many options.  One mistake I made was that I didn't tell them not to put cheese on my tacos (I'm lactose intolerant).  I didn't realize they were melting cheese onto my tacos until it was too late, so I ended up just kinda trying to eat around the cheese....

As for the food, it was okay.  I really liked the fresh tortilla -- that was the best part of the meal!  The meat I ordered (chile roast beef) was alright, but a little greasy and overall the strongest flavor I got from the meat was salty.  In fact my whole meal was pretty salty.

My taco meal also came with beans and rice, which I wasn't that fond of.  The rice was just regular white rice mixed with cilantro, not the smaller grains you usually see with Mexican rice.  And the beans were not flavorful, other than being a little salty.

Would I come here again?  maybe, but probably only if someone else wanted to eat here."}
{"text":"Love this place, they usually are pretty fast and accommodating! I would say that their fire grilled steak is the best. But we all have our favorites. 
Get the Fresca it's delicious."}
{"text":"\"Thanks so much for being a loyal customer and almost filling up your punch card but oh sorry, we don't care about that anymore and do take those\". 

Me: does this kids quesadilla meal come with more than just disgusting looking orange?

Cashier: Nope!

Menu: kids quesadilla comes with drink, chips and choice of rice or beans...

Might be kinda over this place since last time they also accused my mother of stealing a drink even though he was the guy who handed her a printed cup instead of a water cup.... Oh and by the way she was drinking water in the printed cup!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite salads I've had around town and I'm not even a salad kinda guy. I get a mix of the sweet pork and the shredded beef . It includes rice beans two dressings lettuce and pico. If I do the right thing I would share but I love it so much that I dont. I don't even get rice but it still filling but I do add the fresh hot salsa instead of pico on top. They have daily specials and I think Friday is fish taco and I have yet to have that. I do remember having the enchiladas and loving it. Whether you get tacos burritos enchiladas they make the tortillas fresh in house heat it up right behind and melt the cheese on it before filling it up.  A little bit more expensive than Chipotle a great choice when you wanna mix it up. Handful of food places in this strip but parkin usually isnt an issue. Lotsa of hot sauces in bottles and all the drinks that are not soda are amazing. My favorite is the mint lemonade. Its got a mojito kinda vibe and no one would judge if you chose to throw a few plastic bottles of rum in there(once you get home of course :) )"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill. I use to go twice a week. Every location has sucked. Disappointing. I asked for no cheese I get cheese. Ok. And I had no lettuce for my salad , enough for 4 bites. I paid $8 something for that? No thanks."}
{"text":"Food is 4/5. Price is 5/5. Service is 3/5. Could be cleaner and the line could move much faster. With competition being restaurants like Chipotle, you will only catch me here when my friends drag me in."}
{"text":"I've been here twice.  The tacos are good but both times they were out of salsa AND pico de gallo.  I ordered a side of chips and salsa. They didn't tell me they were out of salsa until I was paying. They said they put diced tomatoes in a container instead. And they charged for chips and SALSA. I asked if they were still going to charge the full price and they answer provided was that technically they are charging for the chips because the salsa comes with everything."}
{"text":"This is the worse Mexican food I have ever had. Why are the enchiladas sweet? The rice is horrible. I'm from Los Angeles and I'm Mexican American so when I here Mexican food I have a high expectation but this is horrible. The best thing was the horchata"}
{"text":"Updating my review from 3 to 4 stars after a few more times eating here. If you're going to get enchiladas, get the tasty red sauce or their medium (sort of brownish-green sauce). The mild green sauce is super sour and just plain nasty. The tacos are simply scrumptious. Their shredded chicken is so tender and flavorful! Portions are generous for the affordable price tag. They hand make the flour tortillas before your eyes. Service is a little gruff but quick and the food is so good, I don't mind."}
{"text":"Food was alright. Service was terrible. I was only standing in line for a total of 5 minutes and got nasty looks from the cashier. Then, when I needed to ask a question, was only semi-acknowledged and pointed in the direction of what I needed. Overall experience was not worth the price or having to put up with attitude."}
{"text":"Wannabe chipotle? Feels like cafe rio tries to be a more \"authentic\" alternative to chipotle by offering different meats and styles of dishes but falls a bit short where flavor and tastefulness are concerned. While the handmade and on-the-spot cooked tortillas is a nice touch, The barbacoa is way too sweet. Cafe Rio seems like a place that can't decide if it wants to go the more traditional Mexican food route or if it wants to lean towards \"fusion\" leading to a not so enjoyable eating experience."}
{"text":"First time here. Place is clean , staff greets you, staff is pleasant. It's build your own style so you pick the ingredients as you go down the line. Flavors are good and satisfying. Homemade tortillas is a blessing. Hot sauce selection is good and flavorful. The soda bar includes jogos juice like limeade and lemonade and horchata. Good for people like me not drinking soda. Overall a good experience and recommend."}
{"text":"Cafe Rio usually puts out a good product within the fast casual genre but this location is horribly managed and it shows in the quality and service. I placed an online order at 7:20 pm for an 8 pm pick up. I arrived at 8, and it took about 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge that I was standing there. It soon became evident that our order hadn't even been started. 30 minutes later, we were handed our order. Got home and opened the bag-our nachos were meat and cheese, that's it. No sour cream, salsa, guac, side of jalapeños that we ordered. My salmon taco was inedible - soggy tortilla, fish was from a can. The other orders were good though. I've been to other locations and it has always been good so it definitely seems to be an issue with this location."}
{"text":"Love this place! Such tasty burritos. What's not to love? Fresh made tortillas right in front of you, tasty meat choices ( I like the sweet pork!) and make sure to get it enchilada style to get it smothered with awesomeness! Then get ready for some tasty hot sauce variety to choose from. I'm proud to say I overheat every time I come here. Thanks Cafe Rio, I heart you"}
{"text":"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, the front kitchen servers are terrible.  The only nice person here that greets you with a smile is the older gentleman who I assume is a manager but the rest are rude and just not polite.  If you are working here at least fake a smile and pretend to be happy if not leave the job.  You're lucky I don't see any name tags or I'll make a complaint to corporate with your name tagged along."}
{"text":"On Tuesdays this is our favorite tacos house. We had 18 and it is usually crazy busy at 5:30.  Alexis has done such a great job getting our special order the last two times.  We are snow birds and enjoy this  cafe in 2016 and will be back in 2017"}
{"text":"It should be called \"Cafe Wrong\". The girl at the checkout counter was taking two phone orders while trying to ring me up. I placed a BOGO coupon on the counter in front of her. After standing there for a few minute she still made no effort to ring the sale. I loudly cleared my throat and she looked up and said \"what kinda meat are they?\"  I let her know and she said nothing until she finally rang it up. She said $23.00. I picked the coupon that was about 3 inches from her and showed it to her. She said \"oh\". Then belched out the new amount. 15.09. I gave her a 20 and she said they were out of 1's and needed to get the manager who was on break. Oh, it was dinner time. As the line backed up, they finally got the manager to the register. Then she promptly gets on a call and now I'm looking at them both in calls and my food is getting cold. I offered to give here 3 5's and a one dollar bill and she said \"no, I already put it in\". After 5 minutes of literally doing nothing she took apart the coin machine and gave me 16 quarters. Brainless employees working for a brainless manager."}
{"text":"I don't understand the poor reviews.   I've been here 4 times now and everything I've had was good.  The singing thing is goofy and it looks like some of the staff enjoy it and some dont...but it has zero impact on my dining experience. 

I've had a salad, a burrito, nachos and enchiladas. ..each was good and plenty of food.  The restaurant is clean and I love that they have a wide selection of drinks you can refill yourself. 

Any adjustments to my food were handled perfectly by the line staff,  just had to ask.

I'm sitting here right now at lunch rush on a Friday and the line is moving just fine.  

I wonder sometimes if people have ridiculous expectations for a buffet style eatery."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would.  Everytime I leave this location I'm so frustrated. Formerly we lived close to a cafe rio in Nevada and loved it. We have been to several locations and always had great customer service. This place is the worst I've ever encountered. The staff is young and careless it seems like they just hired a bunch of 16 year olds and didn't train them. The wait is often back to the door thanks to lack of efficiency. Example, tortilla maker was too busy talking to care that they were out of tortillas while their line of 30+ continued to pile up to wait for her to do her job. For some reason this location is the skimpiest on portion size that I've ever seen. Why is this so inconsistent from Cafe Rio to the next Cafe Rio??? Presentation is aweful, you seriously have some shaggy haired kid throwing tortilla strips on top of your salad with no matter what it looks like he just grabs a handful and throws it on there. I have no problem paying extra for the different sauce that I want or cheese etc. however there is no reason to rudely state it the way this staff does. Seriously where is the training here?? If this wasn't enough to fire the entire staff and start over new then the hair in our salad should do it. Yes that's right a nice long long piece of hair halfway through the salad. Seriously so disgusted and disappointed.  I'm a huge cafe rio fan but after many chances at this location IDE rather starve than go back to this staff. Seriously, fire them all and start over."}
{"text":"Food is over priced and very bland.  Husband had the steak burrito and I had a chicken quesadilla.  Both of us agreed that it was bland and needed flavor.  The place was packed which leaves to believe that either it is new and people are trying it out or there is a market for bland Mexican food.  The drink bar did have a nice selection of options, that would be the highlight of our visit.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great food just love this place go there one a week maybe more. Some if the best tacos I have ever had love the sweet pork a must try the service is always good fast and this place is always clean too. Once you go here you wi never try anything else"}
{"text":"Not clean, employees on break sitting at tables, way too salty, food not hot. Disappointment for sure."}
{"text":"Dinner last evening reminded me of the last time I ate at Rio Cafe a few years ago. Food was not hot; in fact tasted mushy. Food serving area a bit messy. Descent service and OK taste, however $10 enchiladas with drink did not hit the mark."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Rio and the salad have always been great.  It would be nice to not be rushed through the line, especially when no one else is in line, but that is a minor complaint.

Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE cafe rio for its food - delicious and tasty, that everyone can enjoy. This location however has a LONG LONG way to go for customer service. I am here in line now because when I went to call in an order I was hung up on twice. When I finally got through the third time, the other person said 'oh sorry' but yeah didn't sound too sorry. It always seems that their staff at this location just hates their jobs. They just look exhausted and frustrated. But again, food is amazing so I keep coming. Just gear myself up for a not so pleasant customer service experience."}
{"text":"Staff was dismissive, throwing food at each other and lazy. Unwilling to make more queso because they were \"about to close\" at 7:45pm. Costa Vida is worth the 30min drive."}
{"text":"Love everything cafe rio has to offer. I could drink the salad dressing, the chili beef is stellar and the horchata is the best around!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Get the pork salad! Seriously delicious!! But the pork burrito is also amazing! Get it enchilada style if do get a burrito. The line seems long sometimes but moves pretty quick and it's so worth it for fresh delicious Mexican!"}
{"text":"I'm giving my rating based on the customer service.  I start ordering and automatically realize that the asshole making the food was exactly that...an asshole.  I felt that I was inconveniencing him when ordering my food.  I was flustered because of his negative ass energy.  He didn't crack a smile and looked like he hated his job.  That's not my damn problem, hunger is.  He just rushed me to order and it shouldn't be like that.  Next time if he's there, I'll walk out."}
{"text":"There was nobody in the store as my family walked up to the counter. Then all of a sudden more people came in and it seemed overwhelming for the staff. Yet they performed beautifully, despite some negative reviews. They orchestrated the perfect meal for us. Delivering a symphony of flavors in an uptempo rhythm. No screw ups, just pure Mexican flavors... Delicious. What a great experience. I believe the staff is making progress, I was a witness tonight."}
{"text":"Short Review: Wait can be long because of long lines or customer service is really slow. The food is great, I usually never have any issue eating their cooked food. The tables and chairs are all decorated in a flashy manner that I cannot tell if it dirty or clean, but probably is just their theme. All in all, everything is good enough for me to come back once in a while, but customer service definitely needs improvement, especially at night."}
{"text":"Walking in here, the atmosphere was great. Very vivacious, clean and there was a line but it moved quickly. This restaurant reminds me of an overpriced chipotle. Their structure of how you build your entree is exactly like chipotle. I took my mom here for her bday today & my mother dislikes cheese because it hurts her stomach. She ordered 3 tacos & the lady immediately put cheese on them with the meat!!! SHE DIDNT EVEN ASK MY MOM! It was VERY RUDE!! Then, to top it off the lady gave her flour tortillas instead of corn like she asked in the beginning. Seeing as how she was on her lunch hour she settled for that. The food was great but the service here was TERRIBLE!! They really need to have their staff communicate better with the customers, the staff needs to listen to the customers and their requests. Not just make choices for them! I'm considering going back to eating at Chipotle and risking getting sick from Chipotle rather than going through Cafe Rios service again. It was that bad. Good-luck to anyone who goes here."}
