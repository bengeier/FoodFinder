{"text":"Usually love School - longtime repeat customer. This morning, took my parents visiting from out of town and had a very disappointing customer service experience. It was 9:30am and the music was loud to the point where we could not hear one another. Asked our server politely if she could pls turn it down. Explained they have a set level but would do what she could. No change so asked another server, same response. Asked for the manager who then firmly informed us that we were \"not the only table here\" (3-4 tables were occupied on the patio - we were inside) and that it was just how they keep their atmosphere. Asked if possible to adjust even for the 20 more minutes we were there and told \"I didn't say I wouldn't do it\". We reasoned that the other tables would likely not even notice if the music was mildly adjusted, and he oddly agreed, which did not make any difference to his confrontational behaviour. Never encountered such a level of escalating customer discomfort like this manager did in Toronto before, one of the most accommodating and classy food and hospitality cities in the world. What began as an innocent request on a Friday morning unfortunately resulted in a situation that I will not take the chance to repeat."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but felt compelled to do so after my visit to School for brunch with some girlfriends. We arrived at 10:30am and waited an hour and 45 minutes to be seated. That alone seems crazy for brunch and we are a bunch of moms who never get to go out without kids. We were told one hour which seemed somewhat reasonable for the area. Once we were seated the server asked about any food allergies. I explained my two food intolerances and then they sent over a manager. The manager told me they take allergies very seriously etc but then told me there could be no modifications at brunch. Seems crazy because if you care so much about allergies or have any understanding of them you know that we always have to modify. It would have been great to know this before we waited almost two hours to eat. We probably wouldn't have hung around. After almost 45 minutes more we got our food. They refused to remove the egg off of my salad or cook it any longer so I would be able to eat it so when it came it was my job to remove the hot egg onto a separate plate. I mean seriously? But of course the kitchen is very specific and cannot cook an egg longer or remove it if they can't accommodate you. Makes no sense to me. The food was excellent so no complaints there, but if you have any food issues or are following a specific diet I would not recommend going here. I felt the staff was really pretentious when dealing with me and it left me feeling like I had just wasted three hours on a Saturday. All the moms out there know how precious any time \"off\" is. I will most definitely not be returning, but I imagine this doesn't really matter considering the place is beyond packed :)."}
{"text":"ok seriously. i've eaten here often enough to review them.  i still stand by service is slow because it must have been an anomaly the initial times we went. it takes FOREVER to place your order and don't even get me started on them taking your credit card for the bill.   now what's changed:  overall - the score is the same.. but for different reasons.  FOOD - i give them 4 - an improvement from my last review SERVICE - i give them 3 THE UGLY - PLEASE GET SOME VENTILATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i feel sorry for all the workers there. their poor little lungs. i actually had to step out to get some fresh air!  although, sadly i will be back again and definitely in the summer for their sangria drankssssss. just saying."}
{"text":"The best brunch in Toronto! No reservation and you should expect a half an hour wait at least on weekends. I love the cheesy French toast. Almost every table order it. Also the chicken waffle. It's perfect with the maple syrup and its buttermilk cream. Pancake is soft and good to share.  Remember to have a double shot latte:)"}
{"text":"This place rocks - its got character and the food is genuinely great!  been twice and the standard is consistent - unfortunately so are the lines. in typical toronto trendy fashion - yet another brunch place which unfortunately doesn't take reservations. the first time we waited at least 60min for a table ... argh.  the 2nd time we went earlier and beat the rush! Sat morning, 1030am (it opened at 0930) got a table, no wait.  great variety in the menu - eggs, pancakes, maple, salad, french toast - check out the mouth watering menu on their website. AND it does taste as good as it sounds.  we had   huavos rancheros - fluffy eggs cheesy french toast with salad pancakes with peanut butter and crunch bananas (deep fried bananas coated in cinnamon sugar - sinful) + sugar coated bacon ... (perhaps a touch excessive)  servings are large coffee is better than average for toronto smoothies are like a small meal  service was friendly, prompt ... and yes in a tartan skirt.  would definitely return. would have been 5-stars without the lines"}
{"text":"Horrible experience ... Arrived today at 2:15 The host informed us the restaurant was closing at three. We asked if she thought we would be seated and she said yes. We waited for a 40 minutes to be told there were 17 people ahead of us and that we could still wait.. I would have much preferred honesty instead of wasting my time"}
{"text":"Scoff!  They're not open for the dinner crowd.  Finally made it there for lunch one day and there was a lineup of 3 couples.  Nobody so much as acknowledged anyone in the line.  I noticed a few of the wait staff glanced over but didn't make any effort to serve us or let a host/hostess know we were there.  After waiting 20 mins without even being acknowledged, we left.  TERRIBLE first impression.  TERRIBLE service.  Never setting foot in there again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to School for dinner the other day and it was great. We loved the decor and could tell a lot of thought went into it. The hostess desk is actually a raised old school desk, the menu comes printed on a sheet of looseleaf, and there was an apple on each table as a decoration. (At least I assume they were decorations because nobody was eating them).  I'm a notoriously indecisive orderer and our server was very good about making recommendations. We started with the calamari which was a larger portion than we had been expecting. It was good, especially the ancho chile dipping sauce, a bit too salty for my taste but we liked it. The large ceramic bowl it came in was nice but I thought the checkered paper lining took away from the presentation.    What we loved however were our main courses. My wife had the tomato cider vinegar meatloaf with jalapeño mashed potatoes. It came beautifully presented with a small side salad. She said it was delicious and the portion was big enough for her to bring half home and have it for lunch the next day. I had the chicken pot pie. It was served in an individual cast iron dish on a plate with a side salad and small dish of rice. The filling was akin to a Thai red curry (which I love) with a perfectly flaky seemingly homemade crust. I would definitely order it again.   We will undoubtedly return to dine at School, perhaps we'll also check out their brunch which most of the reviews on here seem to be about."}
{"text":"Four of us went at 10 A.M. for Sunday brunch to get somewhat prompt service. Too bad we didn't pay more attention to it's name and mistakenly ordered their breakfast entreés. We eventially discovered that it's just a good bakery disguised as a restaurant.   The bakery items we sampled were competitively priced, interesting and tasty. The omelet and various eggs bene that took 40 minutes to produce were very ordinary to awful. The omelet was burned black around the edges but our guest insisted that it was OK and just ate the center so we didn't return it. All the mains were served on heavy cold plates that immediately sucked the heat out of the food. At $13 for a couple of eggs on bacon and a split biscuit with a splash of sauce and a few hash browns ought to result in something of superior quality. That was a case of extortion.   We'll spare you gentle Yelpers the details of the service atrocities we experienced only to ask if anyone else is getting tired of the increasingly common practice of having to suffer through a food auction when served?   It's disappointing if our experience is going to be typical of School's future efforts. With its creative design and detailed operational concept it could well be the prototype of a successful chain or franchise operation if they could deliver the food quality its menu infers, Wait, they're already operating like so many of the restaurant chains with a studied ignorance of service quality without going through all the extra expense and work of an expansion."}
{"text":"The theme is great! It's worth going for the experience, 90's music, Saved By The Bell on TV, my drink came in a beaker and our bill was a report card. The patio is awesome and their is plenty of seating.   If you are hungry, don't get the Krispy Crunch French Toast. It's disappointing and you leave feeling hungry despite it being huge. It's really more of a desert than a brunch item.  Despite my experience, I still recommend this place, we had a great time! Your conversation will never be dull because the place is filled with conversation starters (perfect for a first date)."}
{"text":"Absurd brunch experience. An hour wait for food which ultimately was mediocre at best. Will not ever return."}
{"text":"Loved the decor and the food was fresh and tasty (would have liked to try more than one item on the menu). Not happy about the price of drinks - sangria was $14 each! For one glass! And my friend wanted to take off the toppings on a burger (specifically hold the pickles), but they said no customizations were allowed, so she had to pick something else. The service was OK, but on the slow side, considering we were on a lunch break time frame. Would have preferred it to be a little more timely."}
{"text":"Food quality is good, service is fine. Just make sure you go 30 minutes before lunch/dinner rush hours, otherwise you will be stuck in lineup for over 45 minutes. The place is pretty neat, a nice cozy restaurant for your out-of-town friends."}
{"text":"Booked this place for 30 of my friends for my 'See You Later' dinner.  I chose School because I've enjoyed their brunch, wanted to try out their dinner for awhile, remembered that they had a great pack patio and free parking behind the restaurant after 5pm! Originally I booked the patio but Toronto weather being itself, it was too cold so we were moved into the room just beside the back patio.  It was perfect for my party - everyone fit into the space without it being too cramped.  I worked with Sarah who helped minimize the menu so that we'd be served more quickly & efficiently.  I confirmed the number of guests & menu a couple of days in advance so the staff & kitchen would be prepared for it.  There's a $10/person for each no show but this is really if a large number of people didn't show up (ie. if 15 of the 30 showed up) - so no biggie.   One thing to note is that if you're planning for a large group - try to make them get there on time! The wait staff tries get in all the app, main & dessert orders at one time so the kitchen can prepare everything in a timely manner (as opposed to jumping back & forth between apps & mains).  Luckily, some of my friends weren't too late.   Everyone enjoyed the food.   The stand outs were the English Fish & Chips which apparently had a slight curry flavour that one of my pickier friends really enjoyed.  I had the Pumpkinseed Crusted Salmon with Salsa Verde Pesto, Pablano Rice & greens.  There was a generous pumpkinseed crust that gave a good crunch and the rice was awesome.  It was as though the salmon was there to compliment the rice.  I could have had an extra serving of rice.  I had the Cinnamon Churros with Ginger Caramel & Vanilla Ice Cream - churros were nicely fried but a bit too spicy for me - of the 4 churros, I could only finish 3 of them.  Maybe it was from the ginger?  My best friend had the Kiwi Raspado with tropical fruits & toasted coconut. He loved it and thought it was great after a heavy meal. It's probably really refreshing on a hot day too.   Half way through the meal, the guys wanted to change the Betty Boop cartoon that was playing on the TV to the NBA finals and they were nice enough to accommodate them.  It's not really a sports place but glad that they were accommodating my friends.   Had a great time and the staff were friendly.  Thanks School!"}
{"text":"I've been twice now, and while they're still trying to figure out the service thing (we'll give them some grace time), it's a funky, nice place for brunch / lunch.  The concept is gimmicky but great: school is out (or in..): The waitresses dress like private school girls, the menus are served on clipboards while the specials come on tiny blackboard-esque sheets. Sunday brunch is called Sunday school, you get the idea.  While they're getting raves for their brunch, the hamburger with guac, monterey and bacon was fantastic, as were the fries. The sandwiches aren't spectacular (Sicilian tuna with olives and fennel was better then the roasted eggplant and mozzarella), the tenderloin sandwich was great.  Glancing over at the mac 'n cheese extravaganza going on at the table next to us was enough to make me break my no pasta diet of the past week...  Great patio and cool vibe in Liberty Village. Enjoy before it gets over-populated (on its way...)"}
{"text":"So I had heard about this place for a while as well.  I don't have a car, so I wasn't in a rush to try this place out considering I would have to take transit there.  Obviously I waited for a friend who has a car to suggest we go try it out.  Like everyone else said, the wait/line up is horrible!  I also noticed that people really dress up to go for brunch.  They try to pretend that they just sort of woke up and meandered over for brunch, but I saw through it.  Anyhow, back to the review.  While waiting in line, my brilliant best friend went and got us a white chocolate and blueberry scone to nibble on while we waited for our table.  You need coffee with a scone, so we asked the hostess if we could sit at the counter and have our scone and coffee.  She said yes, which made our wait much more enjoyable than standing in that line.  Once seated, I noticed that our water glasses had lipstick stains on them.  Seeing as I wear gloss, I knew I didn't do it.  We asked for new glasses, which came back cleaner, but mine still had lipstick on it.  So I had to get a third glass, which was finally clean.  I hope.  I had the Parmesan-Asparagus Omelette with home fries and greens.  It was very tasty once I got it because out server originally brought out something else that I did not order.  So there was my friend sitting across from me, starving and staring at her food, while I had to wait another 15 minutes to get my omelette.  In all, it is a nice building to sit in.  It's cute that there are chalk boards, an apple on each table and that your bill comes in the form of a report card.  I don't think I would make the schlep often, especially with the line up, the mistake with my order and the dirty glasses, but I would go back for the food."}
{"text":"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!!! I went to Toronto from the US to visit some good friends and they took me to School!!! OMG did I enjoy this day and I still have anxiety moments just to think that back at home I do not have a place that compares to School. We started our day with some Cheese & Chive Scones, everything about these was perfect. The texture, consistency, taste, mix of flavors, everything was calculated to perfection.  Then I decided to order the Krispy Orange French toast. (Don't remember the exact name on the menu) This dish is Heaven on a plate. Carefully cooked in a way that the crispy puffed rice stayed crispy the entire time. The Male butter accompanying my toast was delightful.  Everyone on the table was just enamored with these. I paired these with a White Chocolate Coffee. As well carefully crafted. Some other dishes that caught our attention where the Chicken & Waffles and the Frittata.   I am looking forward to go back to Toronto just to visit this place at least twice before I go back home.  My fellow people of Toronto, you are very lucky to be able to have brunch at this old car shop!  Envy you from the bottom of my jealous belly!!!"}
{"text":"So, where to begin? Dumb theme.  Slow service.  Bad manager.  Mediocre food.   All done."}
{"text":"I've been to School three or four times for brunch now and each time has been consistently good.  The wait has not been long, the staff are super friendly, the lattes are great, and the food is pretty tasty.   I've had.. - the spiced Benny on a chedar chive biscuit - the over stuffed Toasted croissant -  the bacon bit wild mushroom Brie omelet -  the Parmesan asparagus omelet   My friend had the crunchy French toast which was awesome too.   A great place for brunch with a fun atmosphere. Worth a try. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a nice atmosphere, but they basically do not serve eggs and bacon in a simple way on a sunday morning, for example poached, boiled etc. I did eat the fancy egg dishes they offer, but wasn't that excited."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Liberty Village and I almost gave it 5 stars. Unfortunately, the service is hit and miss. Last time we were there, we loved the service and were quite happy that the restaurant redeemed themselves. Cocktails stand out and the fact that they bake their own scones and pastries, elevates the place to another level."}
{"text":"First visit to this super cute brunch place. I really did feel like I was back in school. The ambience is really nice and the place was pretty packed even on a weekday. Food prices are pretty reasonable and our server was extremely nice!   I ordered the freshly squeezed blood orange juice and they had run out of so I ended up getting the spiced pear juice and it was delicious! My friends got the mulled wine and really enjoyed it as well.   The most popular items seemed to be the hashbrown poutine and cheesy french toast so I went with the cheesy french toast which comes with bacon but I got it without the bacon. The food took a while and when it finally came - mine had the bacon which I had asked to be removed. So they had to remake mine again for which I ended up waiting again for quite a long while. My server and the manager did come and apologize and even offered a free biscuit which was very nice and I really appreciated the gesture. The cheesy french toast is quite good- really cheesy and quite heavy so I had a hard time finishing it but it's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"This place is solid for the area since there really isn't much there.  It's a bit on the pricier side for what you get unless you go with the big boss.  The pancakes is always a winner, same with their waffles."}
{"text":"The cheezy french toast is so good! I seriously dream about it sometimes. The staff, service, and atmosphere were all very appealing."}
{"text":"This place is so cute!!! When you walk in the smell of the desserts baked goods distracts you from waiting... So goood too cute!! Love this place jus make sure u get there early enough bc it's busy!!"}
{"text":"I will have to re-write this review. I'm keeping the star rating so you can be clear on my vote but I will make a more tasteful review. I was not comfortable with the review I wrote last week slamming the place, even though it was accurate.. Sorry. Back soon!  Okay...I'm back! Place looks like it was cool when it opened, but no love seems to have been given since. Gimmick get tired quickly. Service is mediocre; lacks care. Menu hasn't been updated online and lots of items on current menu \"ran out\". Things like, dirty menus, dirty salt and pepper shakers, old scratched water glasses, etc.; things that could be easily dealt with if someone running the place was slightly interested. Also...woo! Food was lacking big time. I may just post my original review. I'll look it over. I felt it was mean, and I wouldn't want to read that about me. But at the same time, I've really benefitted from online reviews warning me before I wasted my time and money, so....I should probably tell it like it was, and then let you decide for yourself."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Portions sizes are perfect. There will be a line on weekends so I suggest arriving for when it opens. A brunch spot that has two patios is rare so this spot gets busy in the summer. The downside of this place is the price. You can easily spend $25 on brunch with your meal, coffee, tax, and tip."}
{"text":"I\"m a fan of the place and food hands down.  Went with a group of friends for brunch (5 of us in total).  With the exception of our server, we were all quite impressed with the food.    I had the cheesy egg souffle with bacon and it was amazing.  the salad on the side was soggy by the time it was served, but it was really our server's fault.  Wasn't too impressed with her either when we wanted to pay we saw her giving change right at the table if you paid cash.  When we did the same - she went all the way back to the cash register and made us wait another 10mins to bring our change back.  Initially she didn't admit that she had forgotten to put our orders in....but 3 tables around us that arrived later than us got their food before we did.  When she finally came around to bring our food she had ordered the wrong dish for my friend and he waited another 15 mins for his pancakes.  mini muffins - the apple pie and chocolate espresso were delicious.  drinks -  i had a large mocha to drink and it came in a beaker.  they had taken the time to layer the milk and espresso so that it looked great.  smoothies were yumm too and also came in a beaker.  we've added this to our fave brunch place along with mildred's temple kitchen."}
{"text":"Waited for 1.5 hours (estimated wait time was 1 hour). Food took 40 minutes to come. The food was alright, nothing special. Service was not the best, sure they were busy but that's not an excuse.  Received a $25 gift card for the delay and bad service.  To add insult to injury we could not even redeem it when we wanted to pay. \"Its for next time\" they said.  Interest Atmosphere: Yes Amazing Food: No Would I go back: No Would I EVER wait longer than 10 minutes: NO!"}
{"text":"After coming here for years we were told today during brunch they're unwilling to modify their menu to accommodate persons with allergies. \"No cheese on the omelet please\" ... \"sorry we can't do that \"... WTF man? Even after talking to the manager we were told \"tough shit basically \". After waiting over an hour for a seat on a busy Sunday morning.... wasted our time. What a shame. School used to be good. Now it seems they are a bit too pompous."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon around 3pm and had to wait 45 minutes. Our waiter was pretty inattentive (took really long to get to us, didn't fill our empty water glasses or refill our empty coffee mugs). We ordered the cheddar chive biscuits, which were pretty good and reasonably priced. Also ordered the smoked salmon scramble and hash brown poutine: both were average tasting, nothing amazing, poutine gravy was bland and boring.  The decor in this place is really cool, but that's all it's got going for it based on what we ordered. Wasn't a horrible experience but probably not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"School is cool!  A friend and I went on a Saturday morning, right in the thick of brunch time and were seated within minutes.  The food was delicious - we had the SBC benni & the potato sausage omelette served in a sizzling skillet. The best surprise was the sweet potatoes in the home fries! Delicious!  I would recommend this place for brunch if you are in a small group.  The ambiance, buzz and open kitchen and baked goods are highlights here. The clipboard menus and report card receipts are a hoot!  I'll definitely be back (just not in a big group)!"}
{"text":"Walking down the street, my boyfriend and I saw a large crowd from afar...unfortunately it was the line for School Bakery & Cafe. We put our name down and braced ourselves for a long wait. There was actually a couple who had arrived just a few minutes before us, and after noticing they were called, we were expecting to be seated right after. However, there were two more sets of twosomes who had arrived after us who were seated. After inquiring with the hostess, she said she already crossed us off - apparently she had already called us and nobody answered, which was odd since we were standing there the whole time listening for our name. Luckily, she was able to seat us immediately after discovering the mix up.  This is a really popular (and trendy) brunch destination. The whole time we were there, there was a permanent line of about 20 people waiting for seats. I also noticed everyone here was very well dressed!  The restaurant has a small patio facing the street, as well as a larger one out back (which was closed on this visit - likely because the weather forecasted rain).  I started off with an iced coffee. The server asked if I wanted it sweetened and I said yes. Big mistake - it ended up tasting like syrup. What a waste... I'd recommend getting it half-sweet.  For my meal, I ordered the spiced benni - served on cheddar chive biscuit with back bacon, chipotle hollandaise and home fries ($13), which was delicious! I especially enjoyed the cheddar chive biscuit it was served on. I love it when restaurants replace the boring English muffin with something a bit more interesting. The dish was served on a cast iron skillet and came with some chunky home fries, which were just okay. I prefer my home fries a little smaller and crispier.  My boyfriend ordered the Black and blueberry buttermilk pancakes - stacked high with whipped cream & maple syrup ($12). After digging into them, he noted that they were too thin to be pancakes but too thick to be crepes. We prefer our pancakes fluffier... Taste-wise, they were decent, but nothing special.  Since we noticed a counter full of fresh baked goods by the entrance, we wanted to get a few pastries to go. I asked the server for some scones to-go, but unfortunately they were all sold out. Maybe next time!"}
{"text":"I'm on a weekly quest to try new brunch places and I'd heard good things about School. Considering the cool name and even cooler website, I had to try it.   In Liberty Village, I got there well before the crowd and was seated right away. The decor, from the signage to the menu to the furniture, is pure \"schoolhouse\" -- it was awesome! Even the bill comes in a little report card-looking envelope. Cuteness abounded.  Every single thing on the meny sounded delicious, but I settled on the SBAC Benni and a Diet Coke (yes, I'm *that* American). My food came within 5 minutes of ordering and it was piping hot. However, it was drenched in hollaindaise sauce -- I scraped at least 1/2 cup off my egg and still had plenty on top. It was way too much for me. The biscuit it was served on was yummy and, while it's not School's fault, I just do not like back bacon no matter how many times I try.   All in all, it was an average meal. My bill was $16.95 before tip, which, imo, is far, far too much for two eggs, a biscuit, and a DC. I'd probably try School again -- if someone else pays. ;-)"}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere of this spot and plan to return once the patio area is open. Service was slow but I expected this with how busy it was (even though we arrived early). Food was really good and so was the coffee."}
{"text":"The best blueberry pancakes in Toronto! The hashbrown poutine with pulled pork is so savoury and packed with flavour. Pastry basket was also perfect. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch at 10:00AM (table of 2).   Had a great time and would definitely go back. I would even go so far as to say better than Mildred's Temple Kitchen brunch which is just around the block.   We waited about 20 minutes for a table. The only fail is that they have a small area to wait in - which got overly cramped as no one wanted to wait outside.   The Jalapeño cornbread is an absolute must. Warm, spicy, cheesy so good!  I had the cheesy french toast with bacon and salad. It was very good - next time I would try the Chicken and Waffles or poutine which I watched the servers prepare (looked amazing)!  My friend had the blueberry pancakes which she said were great.   Staff was very friendly. Service wasn't slow - and it was very busy."}
{"text":"Had been meaning to come here for some time and was excited about the menu. What wasn't pleasant was being hungry when I got to the table, and then still being hungry after sitting at our table for over 1 hour without our orders. We were asked and plied w more alcohol than food. It took our server a severely long time to realize we didn't have food - the restaurant is not that large to not lose track of you. It was well past busy brunch time. When the waitstaff realized the chit hadn't gone into the kitchen properly, we soon had our meals in another 15-20 mins. No comp, no sorry.   The meal however was delightful - Krispy krunch French toast - would recommend. However, would not recommend the restaurant due to slow service and poor attitude."}
{"text":"I visited School for brunch last Sunday at noon with a group of six.  This was during the heatwave and it was HOT out.  Fortunately, School is an open and airy environment, and it wasn't too hot under the umbrellas on the large back patio (there is also a smaller front patio).  It was crowded with a casual, hip crowd, but not so much so that we had to wait to be seated.  There were a few problems with the food.  Our coffee cream was curdled, my waffle wasn't hot (though still quite good) and our food did take a very long time to arrive.  The consensus seemed to be that the baked goods are awesome (lemon scones were a hit!), as well as the delicious sangria.  The breakfast dishes got a mediocre reception.  Our service was very good and attentive, which surprised me considering how crowded the place was.  The price was a little on the high side, but not too bad, especially for such a nice environment.  I would definitely return, and hope that they can iron out some of the food kinks in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere! My favourite place for brunch in Toronto, and definitely a hidden gem in Liberty Village. The staff was very friendly, and the nostalgic decor brought me back to my elementary school days. I love restaurants that put the extra effort in the decor, and it really shows at School Restaurant. From the lockers, textbooks, and globe around the restaurant, to the clipboard menu, everything fit the theme perfectly! My favourite is the mini report card they give you with the receipt inside. Absolutely adorable!   Now onto the food. The black and blue flapjacks are my go-to every time I come here! The pancakes were fluffy and extremely filling! Perfect amount of sweetness with the blackberries and blueberries on top with whipped cream, and syrup on the side. To tie in the \"school\" theme of the restaurant, they even put the maple syrup in a tiny beaker! I was sold by the detail and thought put into this restaurant.   Just a warning, there will definitely be some wait time if you plan coming for brunch on a weekend around 11am. We waited around 30 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. They have a great system to text you when your table is ready, so it is very convenient!   In conclusion, great food, great place, and I will definitely be coming back again and again!"}
{"text":"excellent atmosphere yummy biscuitslove the decor.."}
{"text":"School was recommended to me by an acquaintance, and it did not disappoint.  I decided to have a late lunch here with a couple of people on May 26, 2014. The service was pretty good and the food was phenomenal. I had a classic Belgian waffle \"Served Straight Up w/ Quebec Maple Syrup & Brown Sugar Butter\", and turkey-apple-sage sausages, as well as the fruit juice of the day, though I can't remember what it was, and plenty of water. The music selection that wafted from their speakers was also really nice.  My only qualm was with the price, but I can't reasonably deduct for that because it wasn't inappropriate for the selection and quality of the food and the quality of service, though Yelp should really have the price categories in half increments, because this was definitely at the high end of \"moderate\"."}
{"text":"The Brunch Bunch checked this place out. The patio was great and was seated quickly. The menu looked fantastic. I was struggling to decide which item to get. Thats where all the good news ends. I ordered decaf coffee and was given a choice of  drip or americana(cool).. I ordered drip , got americana which is $3 a small cup ( no refills) For a coffee monster that can get expensive. Did i mention I waited at good 10 minutes for that coffee? When  more friends joined  they got their coffee quicker than I did but had to ask two servers for milk. Moving on... when we got our food it looked nice on the plate but  its' taste did not match its' appearance. 2 friends had a souffle omelette. Niether finished their food. They said it was dense and had a weird taste; suprising since souffles and omelettes are usually considered light in texture. My food was good enough but iI found the sausages -meh. One friend had the star anise crepe and said it was good except she hardly knew it had star anise in it.  Overall the  server was polite and I really dont fault her so much for the slow service as I think they might not have enough servers on the floor  and the kitchen might not be big enough to accomodate the amount of seating. Our unanimous decision about School is its like a cheap present wrapped in an expensive looking box.  I would go again for a coffee and muffin  but I wouldnt waste my money on the breakfast. I'd also make sure I had plenty of time  to hang around and I'd drink at least one cup of coffee at home first to appease the coffee monster inside of me."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots in Toronto. I've been here twice for brunch and once for lunch and had great food every time. This weekend I gorged on the coconut-caramel pancakes and could barely stop talking about how amazing they were. I also ordered a side of home fries, which I really didn't need considering how wicked the pancakes were, but those home fries were realllllly great. Nice little portion - the perfect size, lovely seasoned side dish of my dreams.  Also, get there early. We got there at about 10.15 on Sunday and got seated right away. By the time we left at 11.30am, the line was about 20 people deep and all the way to the door."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! (unless you're looking for a light/healthy meal to start your day.   You can get a phenomenal assortment of pastries, delish chicken waffles, pancakes, you name it. The coffee is also really good. Ambiance is awesome too.   Arrive early for brunch!"}
{"text":"Decadent Sunday brunch. Nice maple lemonade to start and organic coffee. The cheesy French toasts were excellent, lots of cheese, crunchy bacon with a nice spicy kick. The blueberries pancake were fluffy and very filling. The portions were very generous, the staff super friendly. The only problem is that the place gets very crowded so you will have to wait in line for at least 30 min. But I didn't mind the wait."}
{"text":"I like the theme of this place, to me it's fun. In the theme of school, each table has a apple (for the teacher), the menu comes as lined paper on a clipboard, and there are what looks to be written pieces of homework in various languages used as part of the lighting.   Food was great too. I had the chicken and waffles and tried my very very best to polish off the entire plate of three pieces of chicken and three waffles (I almost made it). Really like the spicy honey they served with the chicken and waffles, it's a nice twist from your typical honey while keeping with tradition. I didn't even get to try anything else on the menu, our entire table ordered the same thing, that's how much we love chicken and waffles. Service is sweet and efficient. No complaints there.   Only downside was the drinks. My caesar was rather small for $11 and barely tasted of alcohol."}
{"text":"When you eat here for the first time you will ask yourself \"why haven't I come here before?!?!?\" It's a great place to grab new twists on your regular breakfast/brunch fair.   Being the smartest person in my party, I ordered the French Toast grilled cheese. Amazing pairing. The bacon was cooked exactly the way I like it and was spliced onto the French Toast using generous amounts of cheese. It was almost like a science experiment gone very very well. Add in the side of maple syrup and you end up with a meal you want too tell your friends about. My wife had the chicken and waffles which is pretty hard to mess up. I'm a glutton for crispy stuff and the chicken skin and/or batter did not let me down. Our eating companion had the poutine without any extras meat wise. The egg on top was a great touch and changed the meal almost putting it into a different category versus your traditional poutine.   The ambiance was great as it was a beautiful day and the windows/doors were wide open. I personally don't like eating on patios but having that outside feel while inside was great.   Wait staff was great. We were served promptly and checked on just enough to meet our needs without bothering us. We had a time limit to get out of there because I had work and there was never an issue of us getting out on time. I think we were there for 45mins to an hour and it was packed the entire time we were there. They basically don't cut corners when it comes to staff. Parking was also a dream with a whole Green P directly across from it as well as tons of street parking.   If you aren't scared of trying something different and new make sure you head to School soon. Every minute you don't is wasted time!"}
{"text":"I went on a weekday in the summer at 1130 am. There was no lineup and the food was served at a perfect pace.   I had the Krispy French toast and it was awesome. The brown sugar butter on top was so good I ate it like ice cream.   Only downer was the jalapeño cornbread muffins.   They were a little too dry / crumbly.   Maybe they were baked first thing in the morning and just left out.   They probably tasted great fresh.   Coffee was great,  service was awesome.   All in all,  if you haven't been here,  you should go!"}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy the best that this restaurant has to offer, you need to be prepared to make it work. The restaurant is small, and fills quickly. Also it attracts a high number of \"difficult\" to please diners due to its location and popularity. Trust me on this, and you won't find yourself in an unpleasant situation. 1) Come hungry, and leave your caloric guilt at the door. 2) Spend money, its not a greasy spoon diner. 3) Come early before 10:30, or on a weekday. Want to sleep in and show up, be prepared to wait in line for 40-60 minutes. 4) Don't walk in with a group of 12, the place will not be able to accommodate it properly.  2 is obviously best, and leave the kids at home. 5) Lots of parking, with free STREET (only) parking before 2pm on Sundays only. Officers do ticket the area aggressively afterwards. 6) Be friendly to your wait staff, and empathize that there is a good chance they are being insulted or challenged unfairly by another more complicated table. 7) Don't loiter at your table afterwards. That's what the caffes in liberty village are for. Go walk there next and digest, people are waiting for your table. I did not visit the wash rooms, but the eating areas and the open kitchen appeared to be well maintained and clean. Service was awesome, thanks Lorraine! I had the Cheesy Chive biscuits, and cheesy bacon French toast.  Incredible. Food was served promptly and hot. Fresh Squeezed OJ to round it out. Atmosphere/Theme was fun and creative.  Spend more time savouring your food, and less time taking pictures of it.  Enjoy"}
{"text":"I love this place.   I'd heard great things about it, but never ended up getting there for a few years. I've been missing out.   The food was all incredible, I recommend the mushroom toast soldiers or corn crusted calamari. I didn't love the ceasar - a huge tablespoon of horseradish in it, but other drinks were good. The staff were really passionate about the food and wanted to make sure we had a great experience."}
{"text":"School's report card:   Food: B Service: C- Atmosphere: B  Okay, my negative experience is partially my fault. I didn't notice the word souffle in the \"gooey 4 cheese omelet souffle\" write-up, so I was expecting a straight up omelet, or at least something closer to an omelet than the weird pancake omelet hybrid that came. I had ordered carefully, because my blood sugar is strongly affected by refined carbs, and I wanted to be awake for the remainder of the day. I had a bite, realized how odd the meal was, thought it tasted... okay, and thought that maybe I could eat it. Another bite in I realized the payoff was not worth it - if I'm going to have a crazy sugar crash I want it to be due to something really really delicious. I called over the waitress and let her know my issue, and asked if I could potentially just trade the omelet thing for two fried eggs. She said she'd talk to her manager, and came back about five minutes later to let me know that it would be fine to make me a couple of eggs. Five minutes is a long time in brunch minutes. It was a Saturday at prime brunch time, so they were super busy and I did my best to be patient and friendly, but twenty minutes later the eggs hadn't arrived to our table. I called our waitress over (she hadn't checked in with us in the meantime) and asked her to bring the bill. Again, I was super friendly and let her know I realized it was busy and wasn't upset about it.   This backfired.   She came over with the bill, apologized, and let me know that the muffin my friend and I had ordered to share (which I hadn't eaten any of, because the sugar without any protein and fat to balance it out would have been an awful idea) was going to be comped. Woo. I was really not impressed. If she had comped the omelet souffle thing, or even offered a substantial discount, I would have been totally happy.   Thoughts on the food: I had a bite of my friend's eggs benny - it was okay. I ate the muffin (the banana espresso) at home - it was actually prettty good. A little soggy, but tasty. The souffle thing was mediocre...   I was really hoping to love this place. The layout is adorable, although it is quite loud. The server was friendly enough, but overall the experience was substandard. Oh well."}
{"text":"There was a huge wait to sit down but tables were moving pretty quickly. I had the omelette which wasn't as good as I thought, but the ambiance and everyone elses' food was amazing! The bacon stuffed french toast was a winner."}
{"text":"If you get there right at open the ring the school bell! Small but good menu that satisfies both sweet and salty breakfast preferences. \"The safe bet\" was indeed a safe bet with eggs, bacon, and a waffle - delicious. Pricing is similar to Mildred's. Customer service was very attentive and friendly. Smaller place good for 2-4 people."}
{"text":"It's easy to see why this place is so popular for brunch. They have an interesting menu and tasty baked goods at the counter. The space is airy and turns into a big, open patio in the summertime. They even have a fun schtick! There are school-themed objects scattered throughout the restaurant, such as apples and clipboards.  I used to go here fairly often because a friend of mine absolutely loves it, but I haven't returned in several months because I got tired of the service. Not because our servers were rude or anything--the restaurant just seems to be consistently understaffed and therefore everything takes longer than it should.  I don't mind waiting in line for a table. Loads of my favourite brunch places in Toronto always have long lines. What's frustrating about School is the inefficiency with which the tables are served, bussed and cleared. Despite long lines, tables will remain empty for ages because there's no one available to help bus the leftover dishes from the last group that left. Hot dishes from the kitchen will sit, cooling on the counter because no one is readily available to serve those dishes to their tables. Meanwhile, it typically takes multiple attempts to catch your server's attention to place your order, get coffee, and even to pay the bill, because they never have enough help to do all of the other work that needs to get done."}
{"text":"On the weekends you may have to wait to be seated, but let me tell you IT IS WORTH THE WAIT!  The decor and atmosphere inside are warm, welcoming, and fun. They do the schoolhouse theme well. The food is all home made from scratch, filling, and tasty. Sometimes when I get my meal, I look at the serving size and think I may not be full, but as I start to eat, I realize that I am stuffed halfway through! I love the breakfast sandwich on a homemade biscuit! And just tryyyyy to walk out of the restaurant past all of the baked goods without buying any, I dare you.  The latte, coffee, and tea drinks are great, and I love the tea steeper you get with the green tea! They also have boozy latte drinks, for if you're having one of those mornings!  The patio in the summertime is pretty rad too! I think everyone should check out school!"}
{"text":"I was there for dinner on a Friday night around 7:30 p.m. The 2 patios were barely filled and the inside seating was practically empty. Despite the fine reviews on yelp, that should have been our first sign.   My dining companion and I each ordered alcoholic drinks, my dining companion's request could not be accommodated as they had run out limes. Really? On a Friday night you've run out limes?   The food was good. I would give it a high meh. We had:  The Corn Crusted Calamari - it was tasty, nothing to rave about.  Jerk Shrimp 'n Pineapple Kebabs - Thumbs up.  Indian Tandoori Style Halibut - Thumbs up, tasty, again, nothing really to rave about.  Mexican Fish Tacos - Again, thumbs up, and nothing really spectacular.   My last disappointment was with the service. Our waitress was quite slow and very distracted. We had to ask for water multiple times and did not check up on us during our dining experience to see if we required anything.   I can forgive a restaurant with ok food and stellar service, unfortunately, this was not the case. Too bad, I was looking forward to trying their brunch menu."}
{"text":"I do not usually write reviews on restaurants, but the service/experience my girlfriends and I had today at School restaurant was truly terrible! We had been wanting to try School for a while, but were always deterred by the long lines. Finally today we decided to stick it out. We had a party of 4, but one of the woman was running a few minutes late. There was a table ready for us, but we could not be seated until our whole party had arrived (a practise that usually  is used at high traffic trendy bars and restaurants- NOT a breakfast joint on the outskirts of liberty village). Being hungry, and tired of waiting, we noticed the table we were being given had four place settings (with one chair missing). We figured we'd sit there and then grab a chair once our 4th party arrived. During this whole seating debacle, the hostess was entirely surly and rude - \"hipster entitlement\".   Finally we were seated. We notified our waitress a 4th person was coming and we needed a 4th chair whenever available. She claimed that they don't seat groups until the full party arrives so there isn't a wait for everyone to order. We explained we would order our 4th person's meal at the same time to fix this issue. Fine. She took our order. (The menu states NO modifications due to not delaying order times... Again this is a breakfast joint, not a Michelin star restaurant) My girlfriend asked for the breakfast burger and simply asked for the egg to not be runny. The waitress claimed this constituted as a \"modification\" and could not be done. She then came over a minute after taking our order and said the burgers were \"extra thick today\" and would take a bit longer.... (maybe the same time to cook an egg a bit longer).   Finally before we received our meals an \"official\" looking hipster came up to us and said \"I hear you have a question\". We said no, no question. He proceeded to tell us basically our 4th person could not join us and they would not move a chair. (Even though a table was being cleaned beside with extra chair) I finally had had enough. I stated that we all have previously worked in the restaurant industry and that the service up till that point we had received was horrible and not right. We felt completely uncomfortable with the long list of strict rules. He then said, and I quote: \"maybe then this isn't the restaurant for you then\".  In shock, we ended the conversation with Deputy hipster. I did remind him this was breakfast and not the military.   The food came, our 4th friend did not (even though many chairs opened up... But what did they care.. They had the money from her order since we had placed the order previously). The food was average, not worth $18 a dish.   The only remedy to the situation was our waitress taking our $2 scones off our bill. \"Thank you, that was the issue- your bakery goods\".   Long story short: too many rules, rude entitled service and over priced food. We will never be returning. Toronto is full of fantastic breakfast joints and School is not one of them."}
{"text":"great brunch spot!! love the ambience. nice and cosy. blueberry buttermilk pancakes were delicious!! i also recommend the spiced benni. prepare for a 30-45 minute wait on weekends. on the plus side, you are served complimentary delicious baked goods while you wait. :-) check it out!"}
{"text":"Best brunch place in Toronto.  (Been there for dinner once, and it was ok.)  Menu is straight forward.  Sweet or savoury?  I've had the: Very Berry Lacey Crepe, Caramelized Banana-Nutella Crepe, Crunchy French Toast, Chocolate-Orange Buttermilk Flapjacks, Spiced Benni, Egg White Frittata, Overstuffed Toasted Croissant.  They were all fantastic.  I make a mean french toast at home, but their crunchy french toast is amazing.  Their baked goods are also awesome - nutella scones, and apple pie muffins to name a few."}
{"text":"School is definitely a great place to go for brunch.  Creative/cute theme, delicious eclectic food, and pastries.  However, this place is always jammed for breakfast/brunch and the service is sub par.  The nutella scones look and sound better than they taste.  Otherwise it's a fantastic little brunch spot."}
{"text":"3.5/5! A great sunday brunch spot in Liberty Village. The Omelets are fantastic. I've heard amazing things about the french toast as well. The biggest downside is the wait. We arrived and the hostess said it would be 30 mins. Apparently, she forgot we were standing right there and she gave our seats away. It took us about an hour before we finally got our seat and that was after asking the hostess about our table. I'm not sure if its work the long wait."}
{"text":"School Bakery & Café is undoubtedly one of the more popular restos in Liberty Village.  That being said, my visit there with a friend a few months ago started off with a nice 30+ minute wait outside in the snow. Thankfully it was one of those sunny winter days. Admittedly, the servers did try their best to keep the waiting custys happy by serving warm beverages/ freshly squeezed OJ. We eventaully got seated at the bar area but no biggie, it was just me and a girlfriend. I tried the Upstream Benni - essentially poached eggs with salmon but instead of the cornbread bun I asked if they wouldn't mind using the cheddar chive biscuit from the Spiced Bennis dish - It was great. I believe my friend had waffles (no longer on the menu?) or pancakes with nutella and fresh fruit...regardless it was good.  School also sells an assortment of scones - MY FAV!! - white choc+blueberry, lemon, coconut carrot + nutella are listed on their website...  I'd go back but perhaps only occasionally as I'm not a huge fan of waiting in a line up for brunch."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but the customer service is horrible. For a busy restaurant you would think they would have top notch customer service, unfortunately it's horrible and bc of that I will never return."}
{"text":"I wasn't too sure what to except because of the people who wrote this place had bad customer service. I was initially told I had to wait 85 minutes to be seated, but got called back an hour later. The food was amazing, i would give it a 4.5/5. Customer service was amazing, i would give it a 5/5, somehow my order got messed up, they not only fixed it but also took the charges of my bill, further someone (i believe the manager/supervisor) not sure exactly who it was,  came up to me to apologize. I really felt like they went out of their way to make sure we had a positive experience, our service (Jennifer/Jenny) was also amazing :)."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the staff attitude wasn't the best. Their policy of no modifications but yet still taking 30+ minutes to cook a burger is unreasonable. When I asked for the garlic aioli on the side the waitress laughed and said no modifications. With premium prices you expect premium service. They also claimed there was only one beer available but we saw that there was another table drinking a different type. Not offering separate bills also made paying a real pain."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and loved it both times. Had spicy scrambled eggs in a popover and it was delish.  Brought my husband the second time and he too is a fan now. He had the eggs benny and loved it.. We didn't get any fruit in little cups though -  didnt know we were suposed to."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try School Restaurant for a while now after seeing mouthwatering photos on Yelp, and man the photos do not lie.   I went to School for weekend brunch with 2 friends on a Sunday around 12:30 pm. We were told that our table would be ready in roughly 45 minutes and ended up waiting closer to 55 minutes- 1 hour but that was okay since we were enjoying our time on the patio outside. While I'm not a big pancake fan, I was convinced by my friend about their famous pancakes. So I ordered their Black 'N' Blue Flapjacks Stacked High w/ Black + Blueberry Sauce + Brown Sugar Butter ($16)and holy f***, I died and went to pancake heaven. They were the best pancakes I have ever had, the black and blueberry flavours worked perfectly with fluffy yet satisfying textures of pancakes, and the brown sugar butter left a lingering sensation in my mouth. I spent the entire week after craving for more pancakes!   My friend ordered their Buttermilk Fried Chicken +Waffles($20) and forced me to take a bite. Sure enough, they blew me away as well. Although this place is a little pricey for brunch, the portion sizes were definitely shareable so I do think that it's worth the price.   My advice would be to come earlier and to anticipate an extra hour of wait so you don't get frustrated."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for work. Cute little brunch/lunch spot. Food was good. Had a salad and friend choose chicken and waffles. Great service."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 or 4 times before the Williams landing opened up. The food here is amazing but the service is atrocious. I being a server tend to be way more critical of service than the average person but no one could argue the horrible service.  There is always a line up to get in, once we are sat at our table we start placing bets as to how long till someone serves us.  I always get the same thing. The smoked salmon eggs Benedict(salmon on the side) and without fail its amazing"}
{"text":"Wait staff are super friendly and the food is delicious... definitely recommend the blueberry pancakes. A bit overpriced though but the food, people and atmosphere were worth it. Playlist was ."}
{"text":"The School is definitely a place to check out. Don't be fooled by the name. It indeed looks like a School but no strict teachers with threatening rulers here. Just yummy food with bake goods that will make your mouth water while waiting for your meal to come.  This place is located in the neighbourhood where I work to but I've never been here before today. I decided to stop in for breakfast.  First thing I noticed on the way in was the baked goods. We'll talk about that some more later.  I ordered the \"You're the boss Eggs\". It's your standard Eggs, Bacon, Toast and Home Fries breakfast but it comes with some neat extras like Fruit Salad and Greens. The meal was delicious and I ate everything except for the greens (not a veggie person).  One thing I want to point out is the service. When I entered I noticed that there was a big group of over 10 people already there that didn't put in their orders yet. I figured that I've be waiting awhile for my food since I was by myself. I was surprise when only about 5 minutes after putting in my order my breakfast was sitting in front of me waiting to be eaten (The group received all their orders very shortly afterwards).  Now lets get back to the baked goods. I had a Blueberry and White Chocolate scone to go. I swear the baked goods was calling my name as I was finishing up my breakfast. It was delicious and I may find myself dropping in from time to time just to try their other baked treats as well. If you don't get one yourself, you may regret it. It was that good."}
{"text":"I remember when School used to be the Warehouse about 4-5 years ago (Wow! I can't believe it's been that long *moment of silence for Warehouse and the BEST potato hash I've ever had).  When they switched over to School, a lot of the cooking staff also stayed on, so I decided to stop by for a \"walk down memory lane\" so to speak.  I'm sure some or all of the staff may have changed by now, but I'm a sucker for nostalgia.  I've been to School before, but never for a meal.  Always for a mid day snack - not sure if they still make the root beer cake, but if so, TRY IT!  On this occasion I came with TM for brunch.  We both ordered the spiced eggs benni on a cheddar chive biscuit with back bacon, chipotle hollandaise & home fries.  First off, their cheddar biscuit is amazing!  Definitely a reason to come back.  It was soft on the inside and fluffy and delicious!  The eggs were poached perfectly, and you can never go wrong with back bacon!  The potatoes were good, though nothing special.  I was slightly underwhelmed by the chipotle hollandaise.  I didn't really taste any heat, and the hollandaise missed that zing/acidity I look forward to.  However, it was overall a good meal. The table beside us had the egg white fritata and it looked amazing, so that's what I'll be ordering next time.  As others have mentioned, the atmosphere is fun and creative.  Their patio area is also wonderful.  It is secluded with greenery - a nice little escape.  On this particular day, I found the service to be friendly but on the slow side.  The restaurant wasn't at capacity and there were plenty of staff on hand, but I found things were delayed.  That being said, we didn't have any plans for the day, so it wasn't that big a deal.  Who knew that after all these years, I'd want to go back to School... glad this time around, it's in a tastier form!"}
{"text":"The food tastes good and the restaurant atmosphere is really cool, but the prices can be quite expensive for some dishes. Be prepared for a queue if it's Sat/Sun morning."}
{"text":"Awesome for Sunday brunch - its the second time I have eaten here and both times have been great.  I had the Cheesy French Toast and its super good - the coffee they serve is so-so but the food is excellent.  Its a nice quiet spot with a couple of great patio's and although it was pretty full we didn't have to wait very long at all.  Next time I come I'm bringing my latte from Starbucks and then brunch will be perfect !"}
{"text":"Saw the photos on Instagram and HAD to come here!!   Came here with my roommate Sunday morning for brunch, after a night of dancing. Even though it took us an hour to TTC there, and about a 20 min wait for a table (Even though they told us it would be over an hour wait!! YAY for people eating fast), and an hour to TTC back BOY WAS IT WORTH IT! We both got pancakes, mine the Cinnamon Sugar Pecan Pancakes, and my roommates Black n Blue, and sides of bacon and breakfast sausage and they were sooooo good.   Only negative was the bacon :( It was good, don't get me wrong.. but like, I could have made better.. But our server was super nice and hilarious, and people came around very often asking if we wanted water and coffee refills. Will for sure be back!!"}
{"text":"I've been to School several times because I work in the area and the experience is consistently the same.  Very good food, but very slow service although the waiters are generally very friendly.  I do not recommend School to watch a sporting event, specifically World Cup, unless you are a Netherlands fan.  When Netherlands are playing, it's an all out party at school.  Any other team?  They won't turn on all the TVs, won't turn up the volume, because other patrons won't like it, etc.  So they are rather inhospitable to non-Netherlands fans.  On that visit they also didn't have 3 of the beers that were asked for, they brought my colleague the wrong beer he ordered, which he kept since he waited 20 mins to get that one and didn't want to wait another 20 and the food order took 45 minutes for simple sandwiches.  So not a great experience overall.  If they could speed up the service (a lot) it would push the score to a 4.  Since it's not a sports bar, I won't hold that against them too much, although it is off putting that they behave differently if it's a team the owner supports.  There are far superior options in Liberty Village to watch sports anyway."}
{"text":"My third time here. Food is tasty, but today I learned how little they care about their customers. Went with my wife and ordered the rice dish with 2 sunny side up eggs on top. I asked for the eggs to be cooked well done and they sent me the manager to say that they don't allow variations on weekends. My wife is 6 months pregnant and cannot eat raw eggs. They 'guided' me to another choice. I understand they are busy and variations cause delays, but I'm not asking them for a change in recipe or ingredients. Simply cook the egg for an extra minute... I couldn't believe the manager wouldn't make an exception.  We ordered something else and got over it. Today was also $2 off Caesar's so we had a Caesar, but a virgin (pregnant wife). Got the bill, no discount... asked the waiter why and he said the discount was on a regular Caesar not a virgin Caesar. So not only did they save on cost of liquor, they charged me extra!  You lost a customer. Shame on you."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday Brunch around 11ish and was able to get a table right away, come around noon I saw the restaurant started to get jammed packed with a back log of customers waiting. It's an interesting atmosphere where the theme is...you guessed it...School. They supposedly have an onsite bakery, we decided to try the Cornbread and Honey to wet our appetites, verdict: I've had better but it was interesting to have it with honey on the side for spreading. We ordered the SBC Benni and the Gooey Four Cheese Omelet Souffle. The SBC Benni was pretty standard and had a spicy chipotle sauce instead of the traditional hollandaise, and the Omelet Souffle was interesting and definitely stood out, tasty as hell. A pretty solid Brunch spot, and as I was sitting I saw a lot of orders of pancakes and cheesy French toast that looked ridiculously good. They serve illy coffee and it is bottomless and we found the service to be passable, not spectacular. The place is a little pricey so it'll definitely be a spot we go once in a while."}
{"text":"Considering I had EGGSHELLS in my benni and it was cold...I think i'm being pretty gracious don't you think? I think 3.5 is more accurate. Let me explain... The potential for this place is great. All things considered, I went with 4 other people who were quite satisfied. The waitress handled my situation fantastically, apologized, comped the dish, and gave me a free baked good on the house (delicious banana expresso muffin!).   We ordered: potato-sausage omelettes, smoked salmon on croissant, sausage and bacon sides, the SBC benni with potato and sweet potato home fries, and the toblerone banana waffle and strawberry shortcake pancakes. I'm a savoury kind of brunch gal...but sharing those sweet dishes as our \"desserts\" was perfect. They were so yummy! Fluffy buttermilk pancakes, lovely waffles... Be forewarned. I guess when I think biscuit...I think, the chunky kind, almost scone-ish. This cheddar-chive biscuit that came with my benni was very thin, almost looked like a hash brown. It was pretty tasty though...this variation.   FYI: the online menu is slightly different than the actual menu.  I love this whole concept. It's cute. My favourite: the upholstery. Black fabric made to look like chalkboard and chalk designs? Yes please.  I won't lie that I was disappointed about the eggshells...crunching on eggshells, spitting out eggshells...is thoroughly NOT enjoyable. But I'm also optimistic that had that not happened, it would've been an A. So let's just say...B+ for now.   SBC's first term report card: Service: A Food: B+ Atmosphere/Decor: A  I'll be back for some more grading that's for sure."}
{"text":"The worstttttttt !!!  I joined some friends of mine on their patio - they had just ordered and had an empty seat. I was told I couldn't even order a drink, let alone breakfast. I will never go back. The server (who said they were a manager) wasn't even nice about it. I have worked in the service industry for over 10 years and was floored by this behaviour. I cannot believe they operate like this."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today and waited for only about 10 minutes.  Not bad considering we heard the line ups here can be quite long.  However, I did notice while waiting that there were a few tables that could have been cleared and cleaned and customers could have been seated but weren't.   Regardless, we ended up being seated on the patio which wasn't bad until the torrential rain started.  Thankfully we were seated on the inner side of the patio so the awning covered us....some water did end up on me but that is not to the restaurants fault.   Anyway, we ordered the smoked salmon scramble and the pulled pork and eggs.  I really enjoyed my smoked salmon scramble.  It came on a delicious scone and the eggs were a bit runny which is how I like my scramble cooked.  Who wants to eat a dried up old egg? The pulled pork was ok...not spectacular.  The flavour of the meat was a bit sour....we thought it was probably the tomatillo sauce that it came with??  I did appreciate the fact that both meals came with a side of greens.  It makes me feel that much healthier when I'm having brunch!   In terms of service, it was a bit slow.  As previously mentioned about the slow clearing of tables...I also noticed that we waited a bit too long for the food - probably over 20 minutes after ordering.     Overall, I liked School but I wouldn't order the pulled pork again - it was definitely not worth the near 20 dollars!"}
{"text":"I visited School for dinner and drinks this evening with a large group and the restaurant was very accommodating. We did have reservations. The service was great--all of the waitresses were incredibly helpful.   The main room features long tables (communal dining) and the offshoot room has smaller tables (you can have your own). The interior is nice and pretty comfortable with the \"school\" theme everywhere you look--chalkboard paint, globes, textbooks, the works. However, I wouldn't recommend going here on a cold night as it seems they haven't sorted out their heating very well. The outer wall of the restaurant is a garage door which, I imagine, would be lifted and quite lovely in the summer, but as it's now February, it provided very little respite from the cold. Quite a few of us kept our jackets on throughout the meal.   I ordered the tomato & cider meatloaf with jalapeno mash and side greens (either $14 or $16, can't remember). The presentation was simple but nice, with the meatloaf and mash in a little cast iron dish and the greens in a bowl on the side. The meatloaf was sumptuous and saucy. The mash was good as well, though the \"jalapeno\" aspect of it was non-existent.   Overall, quite a good experience, and I'm curious to try other dishes. Would go again--but only in the summer!"}
{"text":"For a restaurant that calls itself \"School\", the consistency of its brand is grossly in need of revision. It's unfortunate that this restaurant relies so heavily on gimmicks. The all-female service staff are styled as Britney Spears-esque school girls (we watched a server playing with her schoolgirl braids before handling plates of food). Personally, I'm of the mindset that any establishment which aims to provide a reliable and professional level of service to its customers need not discriminate as to whether a server can fit into a miniskirt and baby tee. There is potential here -- evinced by their capable kitchen staff (though to be frank, there really is too much butter, sugar and grease in everything)-- but the schoolgirl-Coyote Ugly- waitress-vibe really kills it."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a fun new brunch experience so I thought that I would give School a try. Don't forget to check out the pics so you know what the meal looked like!  Meal 1. Cheddar chive biscuits - Wow! And we're off to a great start! It was like eating....  A light, fluffy all dressed baked potato. Absolutely delightful. The only way that it could be improved would be if it was served warm(er).  I'm already thinking that I will come back just for this. Heck, I might even stop in and order these for takeout if I happen to be in the area again. 2. Fried chicken & waffle - Meh. Here it's just a matter of personal preference. The fried chicken was made very very well. It was not oily. It was crispy. And it was even deboned! But, I prefer my batter to be saltier and more savoury. The batter here was a lighter sweeter taste - but to each their own. Caveats? I like the fried chicken at popeyes and the Thompson Diner. The waffles were ok but not memorable.  They were both served with tobacco pepper honey - again it's a personal preference. Maybe it's because I'm not a complicated man, but I didn't think the tabosco/honey combination added anything memorable to the experience. 3. My gf ordered the four cheese omelet souffle - Don't be fooled, this is not your dessert soufflé experience! Or a regular omelet experience! The soufflé was interesting and had a texture more like pancakes than eggs. So.. it's heavier than you think. My gf and I thought it was too much of the same taste. The dish probably would have been just as effective if it was half the size - but hey, should you really complain about getting too much food? The home fries were incredible. They actually resemble real vegetables that weren't deep fried! Fried (or roasted) perfectly.   Service Nothing to write about here. I mean it was good -but it's not like the menu needed particular explanation or we were very needy. And the coffee wasn't bottomless so it's not like we needed top ups. Certainly not at $2.75 a cup.  Ambiance - Super cute. Everything has a school theme! On their menus, private parties are referred to as \"private school\", after work drinks are referred to as \"detention\", dinner menu is part of \"night school\".   How much I paid - $60 for two. That's... not cheap. So it's a bit too expensive to be my \"go to\" place every weekend. Coffee was $2.75 for a large with no refills.  Tips: There's LOTS of free parking (at night and on weekends). Don't go to the pay lot across the street! The entrance to the parking lot is tucked behind the restaurant on Liberty St.   Will I go back? Yes, overall the menu looks great and it looks like there's lots of interesting things to try.  You can't tell it from the menu online, but in real life, the apple pie muffins, nutella scones, and white chocolate blueberry scones look incredible. I can't wait to try them! (And will also have something with home fries and the cheddar chive biscuits again)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Tried the Krispy krunch french toast and super cheesy bacon french toast with the apple sausage. Skip the sausage, it was not good :( The French toast was amazing! Lots of great texture and flavor!  Service was lukewarm, I had a stroller and hostess was going to squeeze me in a spot where people are constantly walking in and out. Asked for another table and got it.  Went on Monday around noon and the restaurant was about 75% full. Fairly busy!"}
{"text":"What a superb and fun concept!!! \"Night school\", \"detention\", \"dont skip school\", etc. Also most importantly the food is amazing. Beautifully put together and tastes delish! I got the fried chicken and pancakes. Highly recommend it. It's not some greasy diner. It's well crafted upscale brunch!"}
{"text":"We came here for a company lunch today with 12 people.  They don't usually make reservations, but they were accommodating since it was a large group.  They weren't set up for a group this large, so they pushed a few tables together; not exactly ideal, but it worked.  The food was good all around with the burgers, fish and chips, and chili getting very positive reviews.  I had a pretty standard breakfast spread (eggs, bacon, regular and sweet potato home fries) and they were pretty good.  I liked the home fries in particular.  I don't know if I would bring as large a group back, but I would go there again.  The dining options in Liberty Village are limited and I wasn't much of a fan of the Warehouse Grill (previously in the space), so School is a welcome addition."}
{"text":"after Sunday's second time visit, my family will definitely not be returning to this restaurant until their servers get re-trained; it seems like everyone is running around and not catering to their customer--- how would you like to receive the following answers from your \"sweet, goody good lady server\"; after a 35 minute wait for our breakfasts from order time - i asked her where our meals were, and she replies 'we aren't the only ones in the restaurant; and the food she delivered was cold particularly the egg meals; and then placed an order for cocktails at 11 am and 15 minutes later, we were wandering again and she replies 'there's 50 drinks b4 us --- wow she was just a very bitter person this time around; i guess she failed her course in home economics ---- nothing will get us to run back there for a while --- this one needs a suspension not 'detention' known as 'happy hour'"}
{"text":"Don't come here with empty stomach! It's been 1 and 20 mins wait for Sunday lunch still no food showed up. Very had attitude from the waitress. Only 3 people worked on the kitchen. Jeez ."}
{"text":"Yes. Chicken and waffles are amazing here! Really incomparable to the same yet disappointing dish at harlem. This is also coming from a friend that lived in texas and craves southern food!    We also ordered french toast with bacon, yum! Who doesn't love sweet and salty? And the spanish omlette with chorizo.  Good but the other two dishes took the prize!   Downside was the wait in line and it made me realize I really do appreciate the restaurants that are willing to call your cell phone when your table is ready...which surprisingly they didn't do..."}
{"text":"CHICKEN & WAFFLES - 2/5 I'm surprised this is one of their most popular dishes. I'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 as the fried chicken was surprisingly not oily, but the chicken was very dry. I believe they use chicken breast. It was still tasty though. The waffle was average. Nothing to write home about.  SUPER CHEESY BACON FRENCH TOAST - 5/5 You'd think that maple syrup + cheese wouldn't mix but this dish is delicious. It is very heavy though as it is covered in cheese and bacon. I recommend sharing. It comes with a side of greens, if you need to make yourself feel better after indulging in this.  PAN-FRIED HASHBROWNS WITH JALAPENO SOUR CREAM - 3.5/5 My friend and I got this as a side since we had wanted to try the skillet too. The hash has a bit of a spicy kick which is nice, but still a fairly average dish. It was fine but nothing too special.  Overall, it is a decent brunch place. I would come back for the cheesy french toast and maybe try their other dishes. The staff are great and the decor is cute but as many people have noted, get here early or you will have to wait along time for a table. They also will not seat you unless your entire table is there. My friend and I got there shortly after 10am on a Saturday and they were able to seat us immediately, but our entire table wasn't there so we had to wait. By the time our friends made it there at 11, the wait was about 40-45min. So seriously get there early."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty packed but the line moved really fast. Our waitress was really nice and super attentive. I ordered the captain crunch French toast with orange marmalade and brown sugar butter for 14 dollars and a side of bacon for 5. It was really good and worth the money. The vanilla late was really good too."}
{"text":"I have eaten here in the past and enjoyed the food but the strict refusal to change any part of a dish due to allergies caused my party to leave hungry yesterday. A request for egg whites was denied, even after a conversation with the manager, that it was due to a severe allergy. The alternative option given was to order the sweets and pastries OR even worse to order the egg dish and they would provide us a plate to put the eggs on the side. You wouldn't even just take the egg off the salad. This antiquated mentality is selfish and not customer focused, to not offer slight changes to a dish, or something simple as egg whites due to allergies is troublesome and I am sad to say I won't be coming back to eat here in future."}
{"text":"Had brunch at School on Saturday, in the early afternoon.  Thankfully, no line-ups, but, it was relatively busy for the time and date.  Very cool vibe to the place, good service, but, a bit unclean (i.e. crumbs and dog/cat hair on the benches).  As for the food, which it is ultimately all about, being a foodie and all, I was underwhelmed.   Given that Brad Moore is the chef, and, had a great brunch at Xacutti, I went in with high expectations, but, was disappointed.  I tried the SBC benni and the souffle, neither of which were anything to write home about.  The special sauce on the eggs benni ruined the dish.  Too many flavours that did not go well together, between the spicy sauce, the eggs, and, the biscuit on which it is served (and I like spicy).  As for the souffle, it was flavourless, as, the cheese overwhelmed the eggs, and, it was not seasoned at all.  Very bland.  With that being said, with all the places to eat in Toronto, I would not return.  The decor and concept is cool, but, the food is underwhelming."}
{"text":"this place is simply HORRIBLE!!! starting from wait time and rude waitresses and ending with overpriced food which was nothing special, just a regular burger, crispy chicken nuggets (McDonald's style deep fried) and caesar.. dont go there if you appreciate quality/value ratio"}
{"text":"I've been to School twice, and unfortunately the second was my last. The story is we waited 50 minutes for our food (a burger and a frittata), and when I said to the manager who served it to us \"that was quite a long wait\" she replied with attitude \"yeah, that's what happens when we have 65 people all ordering at the same time\".  As I was starting to explain to her that the table beside us arrived 20 minutes after and got their food long before us she gave me a dirty look WHILE walking away. Not only did she not apologize for the wait, she walked away while I was talking.  The food is pretty good, but in a city like Toronto that is full of brunch places I would recommend several Queen West spots, only a few blocks away with equally good or better food and management that appreciates their customers."}
{"text":"This lovely little establishment is now open for dinner. Luckily you can go and be treated to bad service and bad food into the late hours of the night. Someone really needs to explain to them that scones are better served warm and fresh, not week old and cold..   The staff albeit is always smiling and pleasant but just try and find one that is an adept server and can move faster than a land tortoise. The kitchen staff doesn't know what the heck is going on. Shouldn't they check to see if their chef actually knows how to cook prior to hiring him?? The fish was served raw, it was sent back twice only to be returned still raw. Are the grills turned on? I could see my order sitting up ready to be served for several minutes before it was brought to the table. As a result everything on the plate was cold. Someone finally figured out that they're not a self serve cafeteria and brought it to the table.   Sadly their patio has remained almost completely vacant all this long hot summer. Word must finally be getting around.  Oh and someone really should explain to them that celery is not an exotic vegetable and therefore is easily stocked.  I shan't be returning to School and opt instead to patronize one of the many excellent restaurants the Liberty Village has to offer. In other words play hookey and play it safe."}
{"text":"Go early for brunch! Can't go wrong with fried chicken and waffles. Strange combination but works very well."}
{"text":"The food was decent but over prices. I went during the winter of 2013 and the temperature in there was almost as cold as outside. Pretty basic restaurant principles; creat a nice environment for your customers."}
{"text":"the food here was great!  would definitely go again. my friend and I came early at 10am and sat on the patio. we didn't have to wait in line which was great.  but when left around 11:45 a line started to form. our server was really friendly. my friend had the French toast which was delish but is very heavy so better be very hungry to order this. I had the smoke scrambled smoke salmon. all very good. the best part was the blueberry pancake. they put Brown sugar in their butter. genius. the only con was it took 20min to get your food. it's worth the wait with the quality of food ur getting."}
{"text":"I'd heard that the service had gone downhill recently, but my recent experience at School was appalling on *all* fronts. Our appetizer never arrived, my burger was barely cooked to the legal minimum, and my friend's burger was full-on bloody. When he sent it back to get a properly cooked one, they threw the patty back on the grill and then re-served it with a new bun and toppings - which is not just incredibly gross, but also incredibly unhygienic. My other friend's french fries arrived with some surprises - they looked like maybe crispy bits of batter that had been left in the deep fryer from cooking someone else's fish and chips? Again, gross."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for brunch with girlfriends on the holiday weekend. Right from the beginning we got an awesome vibe, we were checking out people one the patio's food and it looked delicious, the hostess was bright and happy and the wait went fairly well. We decided to order a \"flask\" of the margarita punch, which realistically was just a margarita (no punch) in a beeker (not a flask), but was great nevertheless. I ordered the cheesy French toast, my girlfriends ordered the cinnamon strawberry French toast and the egg white frittata. Everyone cleaned their plates. It was so delicious - if not extremely fattening, mine anyhow. The cheese was baked into the toast with maple syrup and bacon. The side salad had an excellent dressing on it, sort of mustardy. My friend said her frittata was amazing, with a baked almost French toast texture bottom with a balsamic glaze.  When we spilt the bill we each paid about $30 which I was happy with. I got about 3 drinks out of the flask and a huge plate of food. I definitely recommend this place to any brunch fan."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with some of my friends. This place is definitely not the place that you will just come across and will decide to try, the location of this place is not easy to find and not within regular road way. So it is safe to say that those people who goes in this restaurant obviously plan it ahead of time.   This restaurant do not do reservations, you would have to go in there and register to be put in line. When we got there, we were told that yhe wait time would be 40 mins.!! but because we planned to actuality eat here, we have no choice but to wait. The weather was cold and they do not have enough space for people who are waiting, so we decided to go to the nearest Starbucks. We were called to go back after 20 mins. As we were walking, some of us walked slowly and some of us were already there, but the lady won't let us to be seated until everyone was there which I found ridiculous as we all would be seating at the same spot anyways.  Other than the wait times and this place being overcrowded and understaffed. The food was amazing! I ordered chicken and waffles, the chicken was so good and filling! My other friends ordered Super Cheesy French Toast with Bacon and Black and Blue Flapjacks which both taste sooo good!! The wait is definitely worth it! Their food sizes can be for sharing as well, so if you are going with a group it is best to order different things and share!   So if you are planning to try this place, keep in mind the wait times and make sure to try those food that my friends and I ordered!"}
{"text":"Saturday brunch @ 1:30. Black & blueberry pancakes stupendous, not overly filling. Stuffed croissant is a specialty and deservedly so. Lovely bldg and atmosphere. Service spotty and distracted (waiter came back to ask us to repeat our order). Bathrooms disgusting. But I'm sure they can take care of that."}
{"text":"Last time I came here to try for brunch but it was such a long wait, we went somewhere else instead. This time, we tried to go on a weekday hoping that it will not be crazy. We were right, no wait, straight into getting a table. We were seated at the back of the restaurant with the sun shinning in. I was deciding between eating a breakfast dish or a lunch dish. The last minute, I decided on the waffles & fried chicken ($19) dish.  Even though there wasn't many tables, the food did take awhile to come. Luckily we were not on a schedule and had all the time in the world. The plate was good. The waffles was freshly made, the chicken was hot and crispy with Tabasco-Pepper honey. The chicken had good flavours on the crust. I was quite full after eating the last bite. Overall, it was a good dish but it was quite expensive so not your every week brunch place."}
{"text":"Food is alright....The clientele is full of douchey, pretentious hipsters which made for a bad ambience."}
{"text":"Ok. So  will get negative stuff out of the way first. Line is extremely long. Had to wait an hour and a half. Second, it is NOT cheap. BUT I still give this 5 stars for three reasons. 1) Vibe is great. They were playing old school hip-hop with full house on TV on Sunday morning. 2) Staff is very friendly and make sure you are taken care of. 3) Three the food and drinks are great! Their special caesar comes with a piece of bacon and if totally worth the money. Their French Toast with Cheese and Bacon was very good as well. Want to go try more stuff on their menu and see if they are any good, but guessing from the food that I had, I will definitely go back and try rest of their menu."}
{"text":"We arrived at it opened at 9:30 and that seems to be key as there were plenty of tables but they all full within 15 minutes and an hour later there was a line-up out the door.   As one of my brunchmates admitted, she likes her brunch joints to be pretentious and this place fits the bill. It's very hipster stylish and fits in well with the Liberty Village crowd.   Fortunately it has the cooking talent to back it up. I had spiced eggs benni which I highly recommend. It's a herbed scone topped with peameal ham and a perfectly cooked poached egg with hash browns on the side. It was so massive I could not finish it all so they gave me a box to take the rest home.  Friends had the Melted Gooey Four Cheese Omelet Souffle ($14),     Parmesan-Asparagus Omelet with Cracked Pepper, Home Fries & Greens (add Bacon $3) $13 and the Breakfast Salad Avocado, Crispy Pancetta, Frisee & Arugula in Lemon Pepper Vinaigrette ($13).   Everyone really enjoyed their meal although my friend who had the salad didn't rave about it, I think it's good they have a healthy option on the menu and it's not their fault she's on a diet and would rather eat bacon and eggs.  We didn't realize there was a line-up but the server was really anxious to turn the table which is kind of annoying. But once we saw the line was felt badly for lounging around but that's the privilege you get for waking up early.  All in all I'd definitely go back as there were a few other things I wanted to try. But I'd only go if I could be there at 9:30 as I hate waiting for breakfast."}
{"text":"Service is nice  Floors are dirty.   Food is overhyped.   Egg nog was a disappointment. Served Luke warm. Not hearty enough.   Chicken with waffles was a 6. Chicken had no flavour. Coleslaw had no flavour. Syrup had a weird flavour.   French toast was good. A solid 8 dish.   Bottom line - not worth the wait. Over hyped. Under delivered."}
{"text":"Second time at School (went a few years ago) and impressed once again- definitely one of the best brunch spots in Toronto in terms of food quality/creativity, service and atmosphere. Arrived around 10:15 am and though there was a bit of a line/wait to get our names on the wait list, the free mini cookies handed out to us made up for it.  Table for 5 was ready 30 minutes later (to the minute of when the hostess estimated it would be) and we were promptly seated on the front patio where the shade/breeze kept it comfortable despite the summer heat.  Everyone enjoyed their meals, including two friends visiting from NYC who had never been. Highlights included the freshly squeezed juice (Pear Basil), Pecan + Basil Mascarpone Pancakes, Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast and the Buttermilk Fried Chicken + Waffles.  Service was attentive (water was regularly refilled, orders taken without delay) and friendly, and though it IS a busy place, we never felt rushed.  Don't let the long wait times deter you- would suggest going early (e.g. before 11 am), and venturing off for a coffee in the area while you await the text notifying you of your table. Will certainly return again soon!"}
{"text":"Being a new business I'm the neighborhood our first opportunity we took a walk around the block and see what's around. We stopped at School for a tea and salad. We were well received and as I watched staff doing what they do,  I liked what i seen. It was ia really easy flowing establishment. Great atmosphere and im sure that the patio will be our future Friday afternoons meeting location when this weather changes.  Great service.  Great salad. Great staff."}
{"text":"If going on a Sunday, expect it to be busy and have a wait time. The earlier you go, the better. Service was good and the food was excellent. Ordered the black & blue stacked flapjacks, Krispy French toast, hash browns, and a raspberry lemonade juicy lunch lady. Everything tasted excellent! It was a great experience for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Large portion sizes and food looks great especially in photos... But I think it looks better than it really tastes. Over half hour wait is the norm too. The cheesecake filled French toast is just some cheesecake smeared in between the 2 toast bricks..., not stuffed INSIDE"}
{"text":"Favourite West side brunch spot. Everything on the menu is delicious and love how it's served, drinks in science beakers and receipt in a report card envelope, they have all the details and great decor. The no reservation 1 hour wait is the only minus, but you can easily head there first, put your name down and head to Balzacs for coffee or walk around West Elm in Liberty Village while waiting for your table text. Really cute secluded and quiet patio too"}
{"text":"The food is soooo yummy. I ordered the four cheese omelet souffle and I feel like that should be my go-to, but I will definitely be back to try other menu items. I went around noon and the restaurant was busy with a line to the door. My friend was already seated but I noticed the hostess handing out shot glasses of what looked like a smoothie to those waiting in line. Very nice touch. Because School was so busy, it lead to our server rushing around and not giving our table enough attention. I'm low maintenance enough that I can forgive this, but it might be something to keep in mind if you decide to go on a weekend morning/early afternoon."}
{"text":"The overall grade for School Bakery & Café is a C- for me.  I like the space design and layout of the restaurant.  Awesome outdoor/patio seating.    Items on the menu are diverse with interesting ingredients.  We ordered the egg white frittata, chorizo potato omelet and black and blueberry pancakes.  The frittata came out hot and crispy around the edges, the way I like it.  Just a bit disappointed with the overall flavors, both the frittata and the guacamole were bland.  The omelet was nice and fluffy.  The creaminess from the goat cheese complimented the dish nicely.  However, a spicier and more flavorful chorizo would have made this dish a hit for me.  Pancakes were decent.  Love the way they serve syrup on the side in a cute shot glass-like container.  At 2:30 PM, there was no queue.  The restaurant was half empty, yet the service was extremely slow.  Also, we feel that the restaurant was on the expensive side, particularly for an omelet and a tossed salad."}
{"text":"Pretty good but not worth the 45 minute wait. I did see Rachel McAdams there once but she didn't even get a table!"}
{"text":"We had Ian B as our server. He was awesome, very attentive and got everything to us as we needed it. He was very polite and happy the whole time. The food was great, big portions and the coffee wasn't bad either. This is one of my new favourite breakfast places to go in Liberty Village!"}
{"text":"This was my first time at School and I think it was fantastic overall! Definitely a place I would come back to in order to try their other dishes. We came here for Easter Sunday brunch had a great time!  Wait time: Knowing full well the notorious wait time for brunch here we were mentally prepared to stand outside and brave the April rain/snow (welcome to Toronto). We saw a small line up out the door but went in to try our luck anyways. A very friendly staff greeted us right at the entrance and told us that the wait time was going to just over an hour (We got there around 12:35pm). To our pleasant surprise he was able to take our name and phone number so we can hang out somewhere else and get a text when our table was ready (every restaurant should do this!) so we can come back. He was very nice, and I did not feel rushed at all, another pleasant surprise given the restaurant's popularity. We hung out around liberty village market just a block away and got a text 50 minutes later.  Parking: There is a huge green P parking lot that has the new mobile pay function right across the street from the restaurant, super convenient and hard to come by if this was right in downtown. Parking is $3 for an hour.  FOOD: Everything other reviewers have said. I really liked the fact that the menu was small so making a choice is (relatively) easy. I got the special pink lemonade, smoked salmon breakfast salad, my boyfriend got cheesy french toast, and hash brown with jalapeno and sour cream to share. My salad was very fresh, crunchy, and refreshing, with just the perfect amount of dressing. The fingerling potato I thought was a bit on the bland side when eaten alone, but if you eat it with the smoked salmon it would be perfect. There is a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of the salad and though it may seem like a strange combination, it all works really well. The salad is actually bigger than I expected as I walked out absolutely stuffed. I had a bite of the cheesy toast and yup, every bit as delicous as other reviewers have said. The bacon is cooked just right, not too crunchy, and a little bit sweet fromt he maple syrup that was served alongside the dish. You can still taste the smokey pork flavour which I think should be the new golden standard for bacon :)  Service: Very friendly, very geniune, not pretentious or snobby AT ALL. The staff made me feel very comfortable, not rushed at all (even though people were constantly lining up all the way to the entrance). They checked up on us just the right amount without being intrusive or pushy and I saw that they all gave the same amount of care to every other customer which I think is amazing.  Price: average $30 a person if you are getting a drink with your order, I thought it was very fair given the experience. Not exactly a bargain but I definitely didn't feel like I was ripped off, especially given the fact that parking was convenient, inexpensive, and the wait time wasn't terrible.  Would I come back again? 100%."}
{"text":"This is place is cool and fun spot for brunch or lunch.   Our waiter was Richard and he was very friendly and attentive.   We ordered the salmon scramble sand which which was very flavorful.   The kale salad and breakfast bowl was also great.   I highly recommend the hash browns with sour cream and jalapeños. :)"}
{"text":"this was the first time my friends and I decided to come to school. we have wanted to go for a very long time and it was worth it. although it was a trek and not in a very convenient location, I'm glad I went.  I ordered waffles and my friends ordered pancakes. they were placed very nicely on the plate and the service was quick. most importantly we were seated right away and checked on. I recommended eating at school for brunch."}
{"text":"Food was great. 70 minute wait time for a table for two was not ideal.   There are few things I will wait an hour or more for and brunch should not be one of them. A place that is notorious for hour wait times should figure out a better system. I saw a LOT of people leave after being frustrated by the long wait time.  I was with a friend who was okay to grab a coffee at a shop around the corner while we wait.   We waired the full 70 minutes.   Once seated our time was quick. And we were rushed out after paying; our server coming and taking everything off our table indicating he was not enjoying our post lunch conversation as much as we were.    If you don't have an issue waiting....   The food is quite delicious.   $10 drinks- including a delicious ceasar, creamy in colour which I've never seen but it was great. The bacon was n added delight on it.  I split the chicken and waffles and buttermilk pancakes with my friend so we could try both.  The pancakes were fluffy and delicious with a wonderful maple butter. Portion is 8 smallish pancakes. $12   The chicken and waffles were great. Perfectly fired chicken and  fluffy waffle. The syrup left a bit to be desired. Agave and pepper? Not sure. Overall good but not worth $19."}
{"text":"Been here for brunch a few times and all the dishes I've tried are great - my favourite dish is their golden hashbrown poutine; the jam is an excellent part of the dish as a serves as a bit of tartness to offset the \"heaviness\" of the dish.  They don't take reservations, so the wait can be a bit long - but sometimes they'll hand out baked goods to pacify the hungry brunchers in line.  There was one time we had to wait over 1 hour to be served our food - the restaurant wasn't that busy so suffice to say we were less than impressed."}
{"text":"I went to School recently to catch up with some former work colleagues. It was the first time I'd been here since it switched over from The Warehouse Grill.  Now it has table service, and a revamped layout and decor in side, while still preserving the character of the former warehouse. I really like the new decor and theme!  I ordered the School Burger, made with organic beef, and I was impressed and pleased with the selection of organic items on the menu. My colleagues had the mac and cheese (the only item she orders - so that's testament to that dish) and the chilli (which I tried and it was great). I had asked my burger to be medium rare, my preference - light enough to still taste, dark enough to kill any nasties. The burger, although still tasty with all their fixins, was more on the medium well side. Both the burger and the fries (and the chilli) were waaayyy too salty, but tasty. I think they wouldn't be sacrificing any taste lessening a bit of salt.   Service was a bit slower (we had lunch) than what a lunch crowd (read: busy) might expect. I think there was only one server for the whole place. 3 stars is a good rating. The best compliment I could say is that I would go back. I'd try a few dishes, it's a cool place, and could benefit from a few tweaks."}
{"text":"I love this place. Despite the extremely long wait on the weekends, it is totally worth it. They have the best chicken and waffles and the best pancakes i've had thus far. Even thought it can be packed at times and you have to wait for about an hour to be seated, theres a little waiting area outside where you can order drinks while you wait which is super cute. The only downside is that they don't do any substitutes or anything like that which sucks for people who want something simple (ie: eggs, poutine, toast) but other than that, the food, atmosphere and service is great !"}
{"text":"Been here quite a number of times and I've always been impressed with their food.  Music is great, portions are very generous and servers are very laid back yet attentive.  I do have some criticism following my most recent visit which I'll leave to the end.  Let's start off with the goodies first.  Golden Hashbrown Poutine - Not your average poutine but definitely worth a try if you love any form of potato and like to try new things.  Their gravy is on point and if you also don't mind runny eggs, this is definitely a must try.  The two compliment each other quite well.  With the runny eggs, do keep in mind that if prefer your eggs cooked, they can't cater to this.  Alterations are actually not accepted here so be sure to read the menu to avoid disappointment.  Anywho, although this wasn't my order, I would personally go back for this. 5/5.   Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast - If you can't decide between sweet or savoury, order this.  Not only will this dish satisfy both palettes, it'll keep your belly happy for most of your day.  What also goes perfectly with this would be their side of greens which, I find, helps cleanse your palette after every bite.  Think of it as the ginger slices with your sushi.  5/5.  Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles - This was the first place in Toronto where I've had chicken & waffles.  Although I've had *the original* c&w at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles, this is not too shabby.  Waffles are nice and fluffy, chicken is nice and crispy on the outside yet juicy on the inside.  Roscoe's is still my fave but this is definitely next in line.  I have however, have yet to try other places. 4/5.   I've had a few other things here but they are no longer on the menu.  But if you're curious, they were all still quite good.  Place is also great for small events including small weddings.  Had actually attended one a couple of years ago and the purpose of my last visit was to also scope out the place for another potential wedding.  It was my friend's (bride to be) first visit here and hopefully the experience during that last visit didn't take them off the list.  Now I'd like to just go over the little criticism that I had first mentioned.  The only criticism I have about the place is the fact that they don't take reservations for brunch but then again, that's the norm at Liberty Village restaurants that offer brunch.  However, when you're waiting for your table during the colder days of Toronto, it's not exactly pleasant. They have this nice patio area at the front which would be very ideal for people to wait so perhaps management would look into investing in some of those heaters for their waiting customers? I understand that you can get a text when your table is ready but you need to also consider the fact that your customers are paying for parking and there aren't too many places to kill time around there that aren't restaurants.  And speaking of waiting for your table, when we went here this past Sunday, the host told me that they generally give those next in line 5 to 10 minutes to get back before they release their table.  Well, over 20 minutes had passed when the party finally arrived.  Quite unfair to everyone else who have been waiting in the cold and/or cramped up waiting area.  Also with the \"waiting area\" which is really the space between the door and the host being cramped, there must be some fire code violation here. Anyway, maybe just something for management to consider."}
{"text":"This year has been a year of lists and one of those includes hitting up every buzz worthy Brunch location and that included School Restaurant.  We arrived just after noon and the place was packed. As expected, we walked in ready to conquer the wait. With about a 15 minute wait our table was ready, not bad given the time of day!  Our server was friendly and offered up some great suggestions. Although School is known for their Chicken and Waffles, the plate looked dull and dry with mixed reviews from previous yelpers.   I opted for the Cheesy Omelette Soufflé served with a huge bed of greens and bacon. The egg was airy and light however heavy as the main protein. It was my first time trying an egg soufflé so i had no expectations.   My friend ordered the Smoked Salmon Salad served with an egg, smoked salmon and on a bed of mixed greens. The dressing was light and slightly coating the greens without drowning the lettuce in sauce as most establishments do.   The portions were generous however the prices were more than I'm usually willing to pay starting at $14-20 a dish.  The menu offered little variety and choices especially for vegetarians for those that are interested.   Overall, I enjoyed School Restaurant and would dine again. For now, off to the next Brunch hotspot!"}
{"text":"Food: 8.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10  Service: 7.5/10 Overall experience: 8/10  Brunch is a fickle thing in Toronto. Guaranteed if you are gunning for some good eats on a Sunday, the wait time will be at least an hour.   Bearing that in mind, me+3 headed to School a little bit earlier, around 10AM and managed to grab a table right away.   The decor is very cute, tying into the school theme. The service was just okay - the food took quite a while and the waiter did apologize but didn't do anything further. In comparison, Mildred's Temple kitchen gave me a couple of baked items to help compensate.   The food is good, not amazing as some say. I would definitely go return but wasn't running back the next day.  THE BOTTOM LINE: good brunch food but it won't necessarily blow your mind."}
{"text":"This review is based on two lunches and a few drop-ins for cookies and such.  The good: Mmmm-meatloaf! Tomato cider meatloaf, to be exact. Moist, interesting - delicious. Coconut-kafir chicken pot pie tastes like a Thai chicken curry inside an English pie shell. Interesting... but a bit gimmicky. Fish and chips - not bad at all, but a bit more fish and less batter would be nice.  The bad: the coffee is awful, both espresso and brewed. I don't understand the fetishization of Illy coffee - as far as I'm concerned, it's just a step above Maxwell House. When there are so many other options available -- locally roasted beans from I Deal or Dark City, micro-roasted imports such as Intelligentsia, etc. -- there's no excuse for serving Swilly.   And the baked goods... scones and cookies are just OK. The last thing I had - a nutella chocolate scone - had a cardboardy texture. The Roastery is a better bet for an afternoon sugar hit."}
{"text":"I would go back to School in a heart beat. Reservations are not an option here. They do not take them.The inside of the restaurant is decorated with friendly traditional school house elements.The food is certainly the main attraction at School.

{"text":"***4.5 Stars***  I was at School yesterday for brunch and I had such a fabulous meal!  My friend and I arrived at 1:30pm and the place was packed.  We decided to eat at the bar versus wait for 45 minutes for a table.  The bar seats were great, we were able to watch the kitchen prepare our meals.  School had a great laidback atmosphere.  Food  I ordered the Parmensan-Aspargus Omelet with side of Maple Sausages.  Oh so good!  The Omelet was light and fluffy.  The greens that the omelet came with were lightly dressed and the potatoes were lovely.  I loved loved the sausages.  My friend order the Cheesy French Toast - it was delicious.  They serve the maple syrup in a little shot glass.  Service  Great service, quick and attentive.  Our waiter let us chat and catch up as our meals were being prepared.  They had some yummy baked goods on display.  Unfortunately, I was too full to take some home.  They even have a patio.  I will be back to try out their lunch and dinner menus."}
{"text":"The food was tasty but the service was less than stellar. The drinks came after our meal and we had to ask for coffee that we had ordered. The coffee mug was stained on the inside and needed a good cleaning. The atmosphere was neat and the menu was interesting, I think it has just overgrown the size that they can offer with a high standard of service."}
{"text":"If you feel like getting gluttanized and you are planning on taking a fat nap in the afternoon then this place is a great place to go.  Located by Liberty Village you have a small old body shop building across from Lamport Stadium. When you first walk in you will notice the crazy line. With their hours only being 9:00am - 3:00pm every day, everyone is cramming to get a bite. You'll see the baked goods while waiting in line along with the live action chefs working. To the left you'll see two rooms for seating. On a busy day you may need to wait for an hour or so.   The food is quick to arrive and the drinks are very refreshing. It is very heavy but delicious.   Don't forget to order some baked goods to take home as they are unique and homemade fresh. The cornbread was my favourite.  Once done take a walk to Liberty Village to do some shopping and grab a few drinks."}
{"text":"I need to come back here to try some more menu items but I have to at my first experience here was great. Make sure if you go that you have your entire party with you because you need them to be seated. Food was great. Fun atmosphere and beautiful patio. So many good menu options. TRY it!"}
{"text":"Brunch review: Design/atmosphere: 4/5 (very cute inside, airy and clean) Service: 2/5 (slow) Food: 1/5 (reality did not match the menu) Coffee: 2/5 (needed lots of cream/sugar to be passable)   We were seated on the patio almost right away, coffee and water came quickly. I ordered the \"Crunchy French Toast with Orange Infused Honey & Whipped Brown Sugar Butter $12\", my boyfriend ordered the \"Spiced Benni on Cheddar Chive Biscuit with Back Bacon, Chipotle Hollandaise & Home Fries $13\", plus two regular coffees.   We then waited 45 minutes.  The wait itself wasn't that bad because the patio was very nice and airy, there were opportunities for people watching because a TFC game was starting at the stadium nearby, but the coffee refills were few and far between. Coffee itself was a good size but needed tons of cream and sugar for it to not taste bitter.  When the food came the Benni was almost completely cold and the home fries were actually small potatoes that were boiled (but not completely cooked) and then briefly fried. The sauce was nicely spicy however.  My friend toast was a sandwich situation, with four thin slices of white bread smacked together, covered in Rice Krispies and briefly fried. When I peeled the slices apart there was nothing in the middle (why do a sandwich then?)....and the bread was dry, without any of the egg having made it into the center :( I couldn't really taste the orange in the honey, and it was a little overpowering when combined with maple syrup. The brown sugar butter was a nice idea and tasty, but again just too much if you combined it with syrup. I only ate a couple bites before giving up, I asked the waitress to remove it from my bill and settled for stolen bites of Benni and my coffee.  The Crunchy French Toast disaster: http://i54.tinypic.com/vy5le8.jpg"}
{"text":"Food is really overpriced for the location.  Many better alternatives nearby, a constantly changing menu and food that didn't seem like it was made fresh.  Avoid."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times, and both times the service was slow. So if you are looking for a quick lunch, this probably isn't the best place. However, the food is fantastic and worth the wait. The fish and chips are AMAZING - and so are the desserts. The iced tea is $3.50 and awful - none of the 4 people at our table could bare to take more than a sip.  Looking forward to trying brunch one day!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. I had the buttermilk chicken with waffles, cheesy bacon French toast, and juice of the day. The French toast was a bit too thick and very heavy. The juice was a little watered down. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, it was busy but never too loud and the decor looked very clean and refreshing (school themed)"}
{"text":"It was a brunch meal for me and my friends. We all ordered different things from the menu and they all tasted amazingly delicious.   The ambience of the place was casual and fun. It was cute how they had an apple on every table, they had book shelfs, they uses measuring beakers as pitcher for drinks, last but not least..they have clock that strikes 3 on the wall which all help indicate a \"school\" feel. I also like how the kitchen was so open that you can see the creation of every dish right when you walk in the door.   Service was friendly and attentive. The only downfall was that the food didn't arrive in timely manner; it felt like a long wait for it.  Didn't have trouble looking for a spot. Street parking is available across the street and if it's full, there is also a public parking lot available."}
{"text":"I used to love going to School but they've gone downhill. I ordered the burger with a kale side salad and the burger arrived burnt. The kale had a mouldy taste so I only had a few mouthfuls. Some other pet peeves: parking is a nightmare in Liberty Village, budget 10-15 minutes of driving around before you find a spot. The restaurant also never answers their phone so if you need to change a reservation to more than 6 people (which you can't do through their online reservation site) you are out of luck. When you email them they take a number of days to reply as well. Sigh. Thankfully we had a reservation because there were 10 people waiting in line to get in around lunchtime and the place was jam packed. And the kicker: my friend and I asked for no bun with our burgers and got a long explanation about how they absolutely don't do substitutions. I tried to explain that this wasn't a substitution, that we just didn't want the buns to no avail. So they brought the buns which we didn't eat. Such a waste of food. Never again!"}
{"text":"Favorite Toronto joint for brunch just cause I'm a bold flavor kind of a guy.  I like how they've got some guilty pleasure food for you there.  It's worth it.  I would recommend their chorizo dish or their fried chicken and waffle.  The jug of teas are nice but not unique enough for the premium.  Their dishes also come with a nice side salad and I still can't figure out what the dressing is made of.  If you are in the area, be sure to check out their baked goods section - they're good when you're on the go. So, go."}
{"text":"I picked this place to take my NY cousins visiting for the day (one of the few brunch places that takes reservations) and was a little unsure about it based on the ratings. However, I'm glad I went with my gut ;) ( pun intended ).   We were running a little late so i was surprised when I got a text from the restaurant asking how far we were and boy was I impressed with the service (also, I did go on a weekday so it there wasn't really a line).   The ambience is really cool and the staff really sweet. We tried the Fried Chicken and Waffles, the Cinnamon Pancakes, the Black and Blue Flapjacks and the Gooey Cheezy French Toast (I tried that). I have to say my dish was absolutely delicious, so good in fact that I've been dreaming about it afterwards (can't type about it more cause I'm busy wiping the drool off my face). My second favourite was Fried Chicken dish, it was great and the hot sauce they give is amazing. The pancakes were good too but I wasn't in the mood for sweet. All of this is served with a side of Maple Syrup and the bacon is maple glazed too!!! My cousins and I had the juice of the day (litchi and some other mix) sooo good!   I would most definitely go again.... (gooey cheezy french toast.... droooooool...)"}
{"text":"Went with a friend today for brunch it's a beautiful cozy place. It took them some time to seat us but the food came fast. We ordered the waffle and crispy chicken and butter pancakes. Definitely recommend the waffles they were delicious however the pancakes were a disappointment they were a bit  cold and had bitter after taste."}
{"text":"Lovely thematic cafe bistro and bakery in the heart of Liberty Village. The theme of school is shown through everything they do so it's got a great atmosphere and awesome patio section.   They're known for brunch but have great food and cocktails too. Parking is easy here so don't worry.   Also a bakery, you can grab your fav treats to take home with you for 'after school'.   Love their unique french toasts which are prepare sweet and savoury and they have a great sangria."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and its been good. The service has always been friendly. I've had the rosemary chicken, which is delicious and savory as well as the burger and meatloaf- both equally good. My bf who does not usually order salads, orders one each time we go. If you are looking for a casual but trendy place to eat in Liberty. Stop in at School."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and waffles are delicious!!! I've been to this spot for breakfast a few times, the food is always great - the coffee needs some work though! Will recommend to Yelpers! :)"}
{"text":"When the host quotes you 1hr and 15 minutes you must know that your table will be ready in exactly this amount of time. They use an app that will automatically call you when the specified time (that the host/hostess quotes you) is up. So there's no point in hoping your table will be ready in a shorter amount of time despite the growing number of empty tables in the restaurant.   Other than the hefty wait time I found the food to be quite good. Not your typical Bennies and sunny side up eggs with bacon and sausages.  Here you'll find your greasy pountine,  fried chicken and waffles, pancakes, french toast etc. On the menu.  Even thought most of the menu items sound like you'll most likely be sitting g in a food coma for the rest of the day, I actually found the dishes to be executed in a really delightful, fresh and clean tasting way.  I had the breakfast pountine which was a potato hash with cheese and light gravy topped with a egg.  I ate the whole thing, it wasn't greasy, overly salty or heavy.   My partner had the chicken and waffles and it was very nicely fried. Waffles were light and fluffy and the maple syrup (instead of corn syrup) added the perfect touch.  The price is a bit more than your usual brunch joint ($16-$20 per dish on average) it's worth a try."}
{"text":"A cool spin on traditional brunch food - one of my favourite places in the city. It's great to go for a special occasion but maybe not as an \"everyday\" brunch spot.   My favourite dish is the hashbrown poutine. They even put some jam in it (sooo good).   Only con is that there's usually a very long line up but I think it's worth waiting for the experience."}
{"text":"Will always be one of my favourite brunch spots - delicious food, cool food and décor concepts, and good service!   I typically order the chicken and waffles, which is what made me fall in love with this brunch place! This time, I ordered the Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast, my boyfriend ordered the Chicken & Waffles (one of their classics!), and we got an order of fries to share. The Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast is a perfect balance of savoury and sweet - I love the cheese, bacon, and maple syrup combo! However, I wish there was a little bit more cheese and bacon. It also comes with a side salad, which perfectly offsets how greasy the french toast is. The fries are nice and crispy and hit the spot nicely. The portions here are really good. I highly recommend the Chicken & Waffles and Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast!   The interior is super cute since it plays on the theme of \"school\". I love the wall with clocks, the apple on the table, and the menus on clipboards.  It's definitely on the pricier side of brunch, but worth a visit once in a while!   Note: They don't take reservations for brunch, so expect a wait! OR, just do weekday brunch here, since they still have the brunch classics - there's little to no wait.   Tip: If it's sunny, ask for a seat in the back patio - it's really cute!"}
{"text":"Came in for breakfast. Ordered the \"Boss\" which comprised of eggs (any style), home fries, toast, bacon and either green or fruit salad. Eggs, ordered scrambled, were PERFECTLY done. Bacon was chewy neither under nor overcooked. Homefries were a pleasant change up of sweet potato instead of regular potato, moist and tasty though could have used some seasoning or spice. Side green salad was fresh and delicious. Finally the toasted bread was also very fresh, the bread was most likely baked this morning, yummy. Service was friendly and attentive.  All in all very positive experience. I would recommend."}
{"text":"I went to School today! The brunch line already began right when is opened and I was in time for the restaurant to play their signature school bell ring when the restaurant opens! I got the pecan pancakes and were they big! There were four gigantic pancakes stacked on top of each with marscapone cream on top. The plating was beautiful! The maple syrup was served in a small beaker, so I felt like I was in my chemistry labs again. The pancakes were very filling, so take your time as you are eating them. I would love to come here again and try their blueberry pancakes."}
{"text":"My son brought me here for brunch. I don't usually come into Toronto and I haven't been to Liberty Village before. I thought it was pretty cool area. I had the pancakes and they were decent, though I thought it was expensive... Good thing my boy paid!"}
{"text":"Everyone is so much nicer in Canada, so customer service was definitely a plus. They were very prompt and making sure we were okay. They didn't forget we were there. They have a limited menu specializing in brunch I noticed, but it's okay I already went there with a mission of trying their cheesy bacon French toast. It was delicious. Definitely going back when I go back to Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch. The wait was about an hour and change... we decided to wait and get a coffee in between since I'd was so nice outside.   So our wait was exactly an hour and 15 minutes.   We got a text and got seated as soon as we showed up.  We were seated at a table for two,  but the bench wasnt the cleanest.  I got the sweet and salty banana, nutella croissant and my friend got the chicken and waffles.  We both opted out of another coffee and werent feeling to have an alcoholic beverage. However, it felt like the waitress was on comission to sell the booze because she kept coming around and asking if we had changed our minds, and not just once but a few times. My friend actuallh turned around and said \"i dont drink\" ... after that we were finally not bothered.  So my friend enjoyed her meal, she has no complaints and finished it all. I, on the other hand found the food to be too much like a dessert and couldn't finish it because it was too heavy and the tastes of the combination of flavours was too much.  overall, it was okay."}
{"text":"Read about this place on Pinterest and had to come visit. The place is small but popular so the wait times can be over an hour. I came alone and my wait time was an hour and a half. I chose to sit at the bar if it was available first and was seated in about 25 mins. The staff was really pleasant. I ordered the chicken and waffles. It was really good. It comes with a house sauce that I was skeptical about but it was really good and paired well with the meal. I took a point off bc I really wish they offered smaller portions as well. That way I could've tried more than one dish without buying another meal. I would definitely go again if visit Toronto again."}
{"text":"YUMMY!!  While visiting Toronto, my friend took me to School for brunch and I fell in love and had to go again when I visited the summer after! The food tastes home-made delicious, the presentation of the meals make them that much more mouth-watering and the portions are large. Both alcoholic and coffee drinks are great.   The only con this place has is the wait until you get seated, especially on the weekends. But the bar is always an option to go for while waiting!  If you're into Instagram-ing 'pretty' foods, check this place out.  Will be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"School is a cute little restaurant in Liberty Village, which will typically takes 45 mins to an hour to be seated. The good news is there are a lot of coffee shops around which don't have any lines so you can sit around until it's time for you to head back for for your table.   When I got there to put my name down for the reservation, she hostess said she would text my number but it didn't end up happening. Luckily, my friend and I timed ourselves perfectly and got there right before she was going to seat other people.  This place is PACKED. It is loud, and they blast hip-hop music, and 90's jams all throughout the restaurant. There are also screens showing movies, and today there was an old Winona Ryder movie playing. I'd be worried if I had a hang over from the previous night.  The best part is the different clocks set to 3:00pm, the magical school hour for children. I'm pretty sure one of the clocks that hung in my elementary school was there too! The small details like the apple on the table, and the receipt coming in a report card envelope are very cute too.  I ordered the black 'n blue flapjacks, which was served on a pretty vintage plate (see picture). The pancakes were very thick, fluffy, with blueberry compote, whipped cream and butter on the side. I definitely fell full afterwards, but would have loved for a thicker whipped cream.   My friend got the kale salad and a side of french fries which she was very happy about. She kept saying how it felt like they \"massaged\" the dressing into the kale.  Our server Rich was super friendly and quick. I was really impressed with the service. He had split our bills without us even having to ask, which saved us time.  Overall, good food and great attention to details. I wish they had their patio open today on this beautiful sunny day, for us to at least get our drinks outside and then come inside to sit for food. Also, if they had more options on the menu that would have been fantastic!  Would I come back here again? I'm not sure, I'd definitely like to explore more of Liberty Village before I make that call."}
{"text":"Every time we say we will try out a new brunch place in downtown Toronto we never actually do. It's been about three years since we've been exclusively coming to School (and Mildred's Temple too) just for brunch. We just can't NOT come here for brunch, from the drinks to to food, everything is so frigging delicious!! And we've never had a bad experience here, especially with the service! The servers are always making sure we're enjoying our meals, and if we ever needed anything. Oh and the old school hip hop that they play here is always the icing and dulce de leche on the cake! I always want to dance while I eat...LOL   I ordered the {Brunch bowl} ~  The scrambled eggs with their jalapeño sour cream was my favourite part!! It sounds weird but so so good when you taste the two together!!  The fiancé ordered the {Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles} ~  Ok so this is THE BEST chicken and waffles we have ever tasted. We've been here so many times but this is our first time trying it! The spices on the fried chicken goes PERFECTLY with the hot honey sauce and sweet vanilla butter altogether with waffle. It sounds weird I know, but you have to try it to understand. It's a sweet and savoury dish without crossing over to the weird taste zone. The crunchy slaw really helps refresh your palate and gets your taste buds ready for the next bite! 100000/10 (that's really how I feel the rating should be like for this dish )"}
{"text":"The restaurant is quite popular so if you arrive on the weekend hoping for brunch the only way you won't wait is if you're there before they open. Our group were in the first seating of the morning and by the time we were leaving 90 minutes later the line was out the door and the waiting time was more than 45 minutes.  The menu is heavy on sweets, pancakes and waffles, there are few non-bread options. If you're gluten intolerant or celiac I would steer clear, though they do make sure to ask about allergies.   I ordered the breakfast poutine option and asked if it was possible to get the egg fully cooked because being pregnant I'm not able to have runny egg yolk. I was told that the restaurant is very busy and they're not able to make any modifications to menu items (like leaving an egg on the flat top for another 10 seconds).   When the poutine arrived (two of us at the table had ordered) it was at best lukewarm. The cheese was all stuck together in a clump because it was no longer hot enough to keep the cheese melty.   Because we were a large group there was a gratuity added to our bill which is totally fine. That said, when I gave the server cash to pay ($30 for my $22 portion of the bill) he asked if I needed change. Given that the gratuity was included, yes I did need my $8 in change. Frankly this may be a petty detail but it seemed just to be indicative of inattentive servers, of whom there are likely too few at this too busy brunch joint."}
{"text":"Awesome French toast and hip vibrant atmosphere. Apple pay to boot! I would be happy to stay in remedial class here"}
{"text":"This is a great spot with a fun menu. Brunch is rich ans always a crowd pleaser.  Their baked goods to go tantalize you on the way in and I dare you to leave without them.  It might not be the most perfect of the perfect but the food and atmosphere are great and it's a fun place to bring visitors without it being kitchy. Standard spot for when out of towner's want a taste of Toronto hipster brunch.  The pancakes? STUPID"}
{"text":"Every item I've had has been delicious. The service is fast and friendly. It has two patios and a great atmosphere. The food is a little expensive for brunch but it's worth it for a treat. The menu changes every few months. The salmon scramble is my favourite dish."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 or 4 times before Williams Landing opened up. The food here is amazing b ut the service is atrocious.  I being a server tend to be way more critical of service than the average person but no one can argue the horrilbe service at School. There is always a line up to get in, once we are sat at our table we start placing bets as to how long it will take till someone serves us.  I always get the same thing. The smoked salmon eggs benny with the smoked salmon on the side....it..is..amazing."}
{"text":"The area is great and the place looks really good. The service is slow and the food is ok. Nothing to write home about. They have the standard brunch classics but their twist on it actually detracts from the originals. Not to mention its pricy. Not going back."}
{"text":"Arrived around 11:30am on a Saturday, waited for about 1 hour to be seated. Ordered the chicken and waffles and the pecan pancakes. The food took around 45 mins to come, which was unexpected considering how busy this place normally is. You would think that they would be able to generate food faster, knowing you're going to be busy.... however, Both chicken and waffles and the pancakes were delicious! Would definitely order again!   Good brunch, questionable service..."}
{"text":"D'après mes amis locaux il s'agit d'un des bars brunch tendance de Toronto. School est perdu au milieu de Liberty Village et il faudra vous armer de patience pour vous y rendre en streetcar depuis downtown. L'originalité de l'endroit c'est que le personnel fait partie d'une école de cuisine et viennent donc faire leur apprentissage dans cet établissement. Leurs burgers et salades sont servis en quantité plus que raisonnable et sont de bonne qualité. Le service est souriant et rapide. C'est un endroit idéal pour prendre le brunch si vous habitez le quartier sinon inutile de traverser la ville, les plats ne présentant pas vraimment de nouveautés."}
{"text":"First time here. Had the super cheesy bacon French Toast and I must say it was phenomenal.  They wait is a bit long as it is a very popular brunch spot. Music is a bit load but overall worth the wait. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I dropped by on a Wednesday afternoon and we were seated right away. I ordered the buttermilk pancakes and my friend the orange marmalade french toast with a side of sausages. The sausages were delishh, my friend kindly allowed me to sample one and I was jealous I didn't order a side myself. However, the jealousy soon turned to relief on my part since I found it difficult to finish my very pretty plate. The pancakes were good but after the fourth one, I was quite full. Service was also nice. Nothing special but nice. One complaint is that there wasn't enough maple syrup for my pancake platter. It came in a single shot glass and I tried to ration it evenly but eventually I ended up asking for another one. And even that second shot glass didn't hold me through. I love slathering my pancakes with syrup so this was a bit annoying.   rating: 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The proprietors of School don't need no education! When it comes to brunch and they are most definitely not just another brick in the wall.  Located in liberty village this fantastic brunch emporium has it down.  The aesthetic of the restaurant is charming, interesting and fun.  Exposed brick walls, giant old school chalk boards, garage door style windows and so many delightful object d'art throughout.  The interior is kitschy in the most tasteful way.  The menu is very creative and balanced with some complex flavours.  I was very impressed with the execution of the meal from all aspects including: presentation, creativity, and taste.  Prices were slightly above market value but well worth it for such a pleasant experience.  It appeared to be very crowded on the weekends. Timing may be an element of importance and a factor that may hinder service.   I know I act a fool, but I promise you I'm going back to School."}
{"text":"Got there around noon on a sunday and there wasn't a wait at all.  The place is kitschy and they really play out their school theme.  While waiting for our friend to join us we got some coffees and a pitcher of lemonade - freshly squeezed and incredibly fresh.  The table beside us ordered a french toast which piqued my friends interest. We were then informed it was \"one of those days\" and they had run out of bread, didn't have eggs benedict all morning, were out of everything... so while the manager was running out to get some bread, he decided against the french toast.  friend arrived and we all decided on getting the exact same thing - spiced benni on a chive biscuit with chipotle hollandaise and back bacon with a side of home fries. Friend asked for the egg to be hard poached, while we wanted ours regular - nice and runny!!  It took a while for the food to come out and when it did - ALL of the eggs were overcooked, one of them was hardboiled. The fries were cold, the bacon was cold - just awful. We sent two of the three plates back and the food came back in less than 5 minutes - they just scraped off the overdone poached eggs and replaced them. Everything else was cold. Also very flavourless. Super unimpressive.   The only reason this place is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is: our server was warm and friendly and upfront about the disasters the place was having that day. And because they were out of bread for the french toast she gave us a pb and jam cookie on the house - delicious cookie.  Will never return here again!"}
{"text":"Usually when I'm dying to try a place, I leave a little disappointed.  I gave it a name: premature excitation.    I have been wanting to go to School for many months now, and finally went on the weekend with two of the best eaters I know, Saltine and Miss J.  Here's the final report card of my first visits in the fall of 2010:  Hostess: F (Mousey-blonde little thing needs an attitude overhaul.  I would have given her one but I wasn't about to embarass my company.)  Service: A  Menu: A+  Taste: A- (the minus is because the baked goods look and smell better than they taste.)   Here's an updated report card from a few weeks ago:  Hostess: A Service: A (the kitchen was back up but she told us that in advance and did her best) Menu: A+ Taste: B-  (the soufleé omlette is still the bees knees but the food is overall way too greasy now.)  The winner is always the four cheese omelet soufleé which, in one word, is OMGDELICIOUS.  A fluffy pillowy omelet with bacon in the middle and a dirrtyyy good cheese crust.    I got the omelet with chorizo and goat cheese.  Chorizo-can't-go-wrong :)  My sister got the super cheesey french toast with bacon - probably my least favourite, but that's because I don't like savoury french toast.    We shared the black and blue pancakes which were ahhhh-mazing, and ordered a side of cranberry sausage, which knocked my socks right off.  I will have to go back to try the spiced benni, the lemony pancakes, and well...  This place serves good (not too much, not too little, just riiiight) portions of well-made (not too greasy, seasoned well, and tastee, yes, double-e tasty) brunch.  All the favourites with a fun spin.  The coffee is good and their assortment of baked goods are a great take-home treat.  Gimmicks can take away from the fare, but in the case of School - the concept works so does the food"}
{"text":"This was the worst food and experience I have had in a long time. The service was bad from the start.  We didn't get menus until ten minutes in,  ordered teas and coffees and were never offered top ups.  Server barely stopped by the table for anything at any time so I constantly had to keep askin them for things which seemed like a complete inconvenience to them but it really became unbearable when we got our food and the burgers were over cooked and salads soggy. When we went to pay, we mentioned that the food was not great, the server retorted that he could have done something if we had mentioned it earlier. We would have if he had bothered to check on our table and done a quality check the way you are suppose to. I work in the service industry and I am definitely understanding when it comes to restaurants being busy during their \"rush\" time but all it would have taken was some communication from the server. Bottom line: food sucked, service sucked and I will never go back there."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Toronto I have had. Get there early or you will be waiting. It's on the higher end of the price scale for breakfast but well worth it. I recommend the French toast smothered in cheese or the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised to see such a low average rating for this place, but I think it's mostly due to the wait times. I luckily live close by, so I've been going a bit earlier to put my name on and come back when I get the courtesy call when the table is about to be ready. The food here is AMAZING. The decor is so good and the music is totally my kind of music, which is 90s hip hop and R&B.   The chicken and waffles here is to die for and so is the flapjacks. I was obsessed with this place so I went there every weekend for a month and thought maybe I should ease up, since the food is very gluttonous.   The key with this place is managing the wait time and the hunger. Obviously, the seating is harder with bigger groups, but even with 2 people, I've had mixed experiences in regards to wait times. I think the best strategy would be to budget at least 35-40 min for wait time. Another great thing about this place is that they're really accommodating with food allergies, but not so much for the maximum number of people (I think the minimum was 5 if I remember correctly)."}
{"text":"There's usually a wait but you get a table faster than they estimate most of the times that I've come here.   INTERIOR: Everything is school themed. The bathrooms have sign-out sheets, the clocks are all set to 3pm... etc.   FOOD: The black and blue flapjacks are ah-may-ZING!!! I usually prefer the salty food, but couldn't resist the flapjacks. They are the perfect amount of sweetness. Comes with whipped cream and brown sugar butter on the side, along with maple syrup.   Since we were told there was a wait, we grabbed drinks close by at a cafe shop. Turned out, no outside drinks were allowed, but the staff brought us mugs to pour our drinks into."}
{"text":"If you can get into this place, go! But I assure you, don't plan on getting a table right away during prime-brunching hours (10-2)- you wont. They are helpful in that they do take your name and number and text you when a table is available, so explore around Liberty Village. They do a good job with their menu of offering innovative meals, which are decently portioned considering you may be pretty hungry after the wait. As a vegetarian their options are slim, and honestly, not very good. I opted for the breakfast poutine. I was hoping for more of a heartier meal, but the \"gravy\" was more of a jus, and just watered down the rest of the meal. It seemed everyone around me was ordering the chicken and waffles, which looked so good I almost thought about going against my morals for a taste. The crowd and atmosphere was fun, and felt like you were almost sitting in a up-scale school cafeteria considering the open kitchen. Trust me, the \"lunch ladies\" are much better looking. The details in the restaurant did follow the school motif. Trendy young-professionals seem to be the \"student population\". As a side note, I certainly wouldn't take your kids there considering the boisterous vibe and loud music."}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch today; not only was it not  crowded (the cold weather might have helped), but we also got a sunny warm corner. Tried the bacon French toast with extra cheese, as well as the poutine with pulled pork. Sensational and unhealthy as always."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of brunch and I heard that School Restaurant's brunch is one of the best one in Toronto. We knew that the restaurant did not take any reservation. In order to avoid the crowd, we arrived the restaurant at 2pm. However, there was a long waiting list ahead of us and the wait time was 75 minutes. Since we came all the way from uptown and we did not have any plans that day, we decided to walk nearby and wait for their app to notify us whenever the table was ready.   The table was ready at 3:05pm. When we headed back to the restaurant, we noticed that a pair of couple walked in and they hoped the restaurant could give them a table; however the guy at the front said they were no longer taking any new customers and asked them to come back another day. (Last call was 3pm, so I guess whoever wants to visit this restaurant on weekend should drop by 2:25pm latest).   We ordered a Super Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes (with Maple Syrup and Brown Sugar Butter) and a Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffles (served with Tabasco-Pepper Honey + Crunchy Cabbage Slaw). The Chicken and Waffles was my favorite for sure. The chicken was crispy on the outside and very soft and tender inside. The outer layer was very crunchy and not oily at all. The waffles were not very sweet and it matched the savory dish a lot. The tabasco-pepper honey sauce worked perfectly with the chicken and improved the meal experience. However, the cabbage slaw wasn't very crunchy. Nonetheless, I will come back for the chicken and waffles for sure. They named the pancakes dish perfectly. The pancakes were very fluffy and very filling. I cannot even finish the dish.   I like the decor of the restaurant and the servers are very sincere and helpful. Originally my husband would like to order their burger. However, they were running out of it. The server spent some time to explain to us why they were not serving the burger that weekend. Another thing that really impressed us was the server asked us if we have any allergies issues. Since I am allergic to kiwi, the managers came and ensured there won't be any kiwi in our dishes. I am happy about how the restaurant is really caring about their customers.   I would definitely go back to visit School Restaurant for more brunches."}
{"text":"So we weren't even supposed to come here for brunch, we had planned to go to Mildred's just a couple blocks over. When we arrived though on Saturday morning at 11:45am, they said the wait would be 1hour and 40 mins. RIDICULOUS. And keep in mind its December 30th, -20 degrees, with only waiting room outdoors... no thanks. Because of this, we walked over to School (it was our Plan B) and put our names down there. Thankfully, the wait was estimated for only 30 - 45 mins. Still a long time but way more reasonable than the Mildred's.  We were browsing the menu while we were waiting so we sort of had an idea of what we wanted, keep in mind while they serve brunch, none of the other lunch menu items are available. Only brunch items can be ordered. So we got the famous black n blue pancakes and the hashbrown poutine.   PANCAKES ARE A M A Z I N G. Just order them and you won't be disappointed. Maple butter, blackberry and blueberry sauce, whipped cream, maple syrup, all with soft buttermilk pancakes. The portion was also really generous and well worth the $17 price tag. I feel like any of their pancake dishes you can't go wrong with. They had an apple crumble pancake as well as a cap'n crunch french toast that also sounded great.  The service was also very good. Even though there was a line waiting for tables, at no point did we feel rushed or pressured to leave. It was a great environment to catch up with friends and enjoy some excellent brunch.   PRO TIP: If you ever go to School and you're waiting in line, take a look at the plates coming out of the kitchen to get an idea of what to order.. The popular dishes will be very apparent."}
{"text":"Finally I made it for breakfast/brunch at this spot. Previous attempts just resulted in moi checking in on the mobile app and heading to other spots nearby as the wait times were atrocious on the weekend.  So on a Monday morning with my dinning companion in tow we showed up at the restaurant. Sure enough we were seated immediately. I was looking to try the chicken and waffles but alas they don't serve them till 11 AM on weekdays. After a bit of debate we settled on Krispy Krunchy French toast and caramel coconut pancakes. The service was slow to start with then just disappeared when more people came in.  Ah well all this could have been acceptable if the food was decent. Nope not here I don't understand the fixation here the line ups on the weekend defy logic as there are better options nearby. The coconut pancakes were a sorry mess. Think thin pancakes one can make at home. Just a hint of coconut and caramel with the only decent thing being real maple syrup on the side. French toast though visually appealing was devoid of taste. Not eggy or krunchy enough IMO. A poor attempt at this simple dish.  My friend ended up getting a scone as well that I didn't try as already had had my daily sugar fix. Major flaw here is the service as after several minutes of trying to get the servers attention to get the check we ended up going to the counter to get our bill. 0.5 star deduction for that. 2 stars! (will try and come here for the chicken and waffle if the lineups are not krazy) Otherwise school is out!"}
{"text":"Great place!  My friend and I came here for a late lunch.  They were out of chicken & waffles so I suggest going earlier if that's what you're craving.  I ordered the Super Cheesy Toasty Toast.  It was slices of thick French toast with gooey cheese, delicious smoked bacon, and a shot of maple syrup to pour over all of it.  It was so good.  Hard to go wrong. I love bacon & I find a lot of places are stingy with it, but this was the right amount.  My friend had the coconut pancakes with a side of maple sausages.  I tried a sausage & it was good but not too memorable.  She liked her pancakes but needed to add some of my maple syrup.  The wait was long to get a table, but our server was nice & attentive.  Saw people with the pulled pork & eggs which looked really good. Will def go back."}
{"text":"I love the food but hate the service.  I have been going to school on and off for a few years and there's def some dishes that are super delicious and unique, that I keep going back (their brunch is so fabulous also)  But the servers! omg, its not that they're rude or anything, they're just incompetent! They're always forgetting something, or really slow or always messing something up.  EVERYTIME I GO. and I've been there 10+ times. Like I said, the food is great and the servers are nice people, just not very good at er.... serving.  ps. their baked stuff is to die for. so delicious!"}
{"text":"The first couple of times I came here for lunch I certainly found the food delicious, and the selection of beverages is cool too. A nice boost to your reputation if you take someone here either for business or pleasure. The problem is the busyness, but also how they handle it. For lunch, you either get a table or you don't; fine. We were seated after some wait for brunch out on the patio on a beautiful sunny day. So anyway, this appears to be my second review of School. We waited at least 45 minutes for brunch to appear - beyond a long wait - no explanations or ETA's given. The treatment was so shabby, we were expecting something like half off the bill when the server began winding up to tell us about the discount we were about to receive. And what we did get was a complimentary croissant or bun, or something. Hey, food is important, but service matters."}
{"text":"If I had just come across this place on my own, I would have been drawn by the playful schoolouse theme and walked out the door at the sight of the young girls in mini-kilts. Since I didn't think my friend was likely to have tricked me into going for breakfast at a Hooter's, I sat down and had the chance to review their tempting menu of savouries, sweet indulgences, smoothies and baked goods. My asparagus omelet was an attempt at a healthy choice without defeating the purpose of going out for brunch - I was rewarded. My friend had the much-mentioned chive biscuits underneath what she said were perfectly poached eggs. The service was friendly, efficient and courteous - our waitress was mindful of needing to keep the patioful of patrons hydrated during the hot weather.  School definitely seems like one of the more interesting options in a surprisingly quiet area (all this hype about LIberty Village and it was deserted on a Saturday morning! Maybe these westenders don't leave the house until mid-day), but I'm not sure I think they would do as well in a busier area with options that don't dress their servers like strippers. As it is, It is probably the place I'm most likely to visit for brunch if I was coerced into going to Liberty Village on a Saturday morning. Maybe I should come back to see if the girls get longer skirts in the winter???"}
{"text":"What happened?? :( this place has been our go-to brunch spot since it opened but both quality and service has gone down.   Waffles used to be light and crispy and now they're just bulky. Fried chicken is slightly sub par. The banana and berries waffles were missing the berries - they were going to bring the menu to prove us wrong - good they did because it clearly included the berries.   The waiting system is seriously flawed. They'll have tables empty for 30-45min waiting for people coming back notified via text but customers right in front of them would've finished eating by then.  Servers are unmotivated for some reason and just don't enjoy working there."}
{"text":"3 words - cheesy french toast.  I mean, they have other tasty items on their menu, like the chicken n' waffles, black and blue pancakes, fried banana on waffles... but there is just something about that french toast that is culinary perfection. Sweet, salty, savoury, it has it all, and it'll become your new brunch craving.   I prefer to go on weekdays since there is generally no wait for a table (when I have a day off from work), and I know that the weekends can get pretty packed. But i'd say it's worth it for the food.... just be prepared for a wait. Bonus, they have delicious baked goods to tide you over. Amazing chocolate chip cookies..."}
{"text":"Tried out School for the first time after years of hearing about it. We got there by 11am and had a 25 minute wait (short compared to their typical wait times of 30min-1hr+). A I would have rated them a 3 but the extra star goes straight to our server Dora. What a little gem she was! Super friendly and attentive, we felt like our own dear friend was serving us this holiday Monday. On top of her general kind service, I approached her regarding an error with a side order (which was our mishap, not hers), she apologized, let us keep the first and brought out our intended order as well.  We ordered the headmasters omelet, huevos 101(my personal favourite), chocolate chip pancakes (typical) and a side of bacon.  Overall I can't say that the food is anything out of this world but I felt that a lot of passion went into this place and I personally appreciate that. I'd come back!   Suggestion to management- On the super frigid days like this past weekend, perhaps throw in a couple of portable heaters to keep the place toasty. It was quite chilly the entire time and even after a hot cup of coffee, we couldn't kick the damp chill from the wait. It's no ones fault but it would just make the experience a bit more comfy:)"}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes. Waited an hour to get in but we went into the back patio to have drinks and wait and time passed quickly. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"This is a great brunch spot.  I'm a little partial because I ordered the same thing both times I came here:  Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffles.  I've also tried the Ranchero, which was solid, but the chicken and waffles were better.  It's a small restaurant and smack in the middle of liberty village so expect to wait a bit.  When you first walk in, the right side is essentially all their baked goods.  I broke down and had a chocolate scone that was ridiculously tasty.  I asked and they apparently bake them all in-house.  They also have a small patio and a few tvs + projector.  Great place to catch an afternoon baseball or soccer game after lunch."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto visiting from NYC/NJ and wanted to brunch with the locals. The food here was freaking AMAZING! The wait was literally 2 min long and the outside seating area was so fun. I had the crispy French toast I can't recall the actual name but it was very delicious. The sangria was so good too. My friend had the chicken and waffles and she was raving about it our entire trip. LOL. You know what I absolutely loved? That they weren't watching their clocks in order to get us out of there. We spent 2 hours talking and never once were we rushed to leave. (I might be too used to NYC service) but that was a huge plus. Everyone was very kind and friendly. Prices were really good comparable to what I'm used to paying over here for not so good food. LOL I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I took my daughter here for her birthday at her request and was quite excited to check this place out after hearing rave reviews.    Made a reservation which was not necessary for a Friday afternoon, but got a little spooked after hearing how busy his place can get.  Seated quickly and greeted by a super friendly server. He told us all the daily specials and took out drink orders immediately. Chose a prickly pear, lemonade with something else I forgot but it was pretty awesome. Should be for $6 a teeny glass.   Nice simple menu that was easy to choose from plus I had an idea of what I wanted to try after drooling at y'all yelpers pics.   Daughter ordered apple crumble pancakes and I ordered cheesy bacon French toast. My order arrived looking like a weak version of the great pics I've seen, but my kid's looked pretty great.   I'd have to say the highlight of my meal was the maple syrup. I don't even like it but this stuff was great! Daughter was quite pleased with her meal-yay cuz it was her b-day!   A tad bit overpriced for what it was but was glad to have tried it out. Not sure if I'd return but pretty sure my kid will be back."}
{"text":"I am a fan of School for sit down service, but not a quick cafe type of take out.   I have dined here for brunch before with Christine \"olive oil extraordinaire!\" C., and had a great experience. But during the cupcake crawl today, I was disappointed by the lack of organization and flavour that was abound.   When I heard that they have donut muffins (donuts are my kryptonite), I was so excited. The muffin was blah. Nothing special. It actually kinda reminded me of mmmmarvelous mmmmuffins (actually the MM would have been better). The muffin was dry, and the only resemblance to a donut it had was the bit of jam it had inside. The jam amount was so tiny and you could tell it had been inserted after it was baked.   The iced coffee on the other hand was amazing. Actually, it was one of the better iced coffees I have had in a long time. Not too strong, perfectly brewed. Just right! The only downfall is the paper cup it comes in. School needs to get some plastic cold bev cups for take-out.   If you are in Liberty Village and want to have brunch at a fun spot - go here. If you are in Liberty Village and want to get an iced coffee for take out - go here (but expect it to be slow and painful). If you are looking just to get some baked goods - go elsewhere."}
{"text":"An A+ place to be for a Sunday brunch. This is a place where you can brunch hard while listening to a good 90s play list! The food is great and wonderfully present. My boyfriend and I shared the Home Room Skillet, Cheesy French Toast (the bacon was on point, soft with crispy edges), a scone, a muffin and tons of mimosas. I have a complaint... about none. The food was excellent.  The \"back in school\" theme the restaurant carries is cute, wonderful and unique. It literately is like YOU ARE back in school. Drinks are served in a flask. The food menu is print on lined paper and the drink menu printed as though it were chalk on a chalkboard. The old quartz clocks are hanging on the brick wall; all pointing to 3 pm (SCHOOLS OUT)! The flat screens are dazzled with the cartoons we would run home to watch... the shelves are decked with the books we would read for our book projects, the receipt comes as a report card... I could go on and on and on. Heck, even the pancakes are staked as books.   If you do come to this place... come early around 10 am or come during peak hours with a coffee and small snack in hand to help wait out the 45 to 90 minute wait. It's worth it though.  I've been twice and see myself coming \"many'a'moore\" times.  Xo Gaby"}
{"text":"I have been dying to come to the school for brunch since forever.  The pictures online always look amazing. Had a 45 minute wait on a Sunday and I have to say that it was EXTREMELY disappointing.  I don't understand the hype at all and it was pretty much a waste of time :(  I had the famous black and blueberry flapjacks.  As beautiful as they looked, the pancakes were less than amazing.  They were DRY and NOT fluffy.  Maybe I came on a bad day, but I'm really not sure why everyone says they are so good! The pancakes at mildreds temple are 100% better than at the school. Go there instead!!  If it wasn't for the whipped cream and maple syrup on the side I would not even be able to cough them down.  I also shared the cheesy bacon French toast.  I have to admit that this was GREAT! The bread was soft and super cheesy. I'm very particular about my cheese now after coming back from Paris, so I don't think the cheddar jack was the greatest, but it will do for the place, price, and concept.   I would come back to eat this again IF there was no wait at all.    Also I ordered the \"freshly squeezed\" apricot and peach juice.  I am pretty sure it was mixed with fruit puree.  Not worth the $6, though it did come in a really cute glass.  I have to note that the service is fantastic once you are seated, but honestly the wait was not worth it the food at all.  There's too many better brunch places in Toronto!"}
{"text":"An overall delicious brunch experience. I came here on a Monday at 130 pm and was seated immediately. The service was friendly and the staff members were helpful with reccomendations, etc. My only complaint with service is that we had to flag our server down a few times for water refills despite there being only few tables to attend to.   The food was delicious overall, some aspects were hit and miss, but definitely good enough for a repeat visit.  - SUPER CHEESY BACON FRENCH TOAST  - Everything about this was perfect. The bread was light and fluffy and the cheese was ooey gooey deliciousness. This is definitely the dish that made the trip worth it.   - Roasted Cauliflower, Red Quinoa, Crispy Chickpeas, Arugula, Radish, Pumpkin Seeds, Hummus Dressing and Feta - There was nothing special or noteworthy about this salad. I wouldn't order it again, it was overpriced and definitely something you can easily slap together at home.  - Black and Blue Flapjacks with Blueberry Sauce and Brown Sugar Butter - The pancakes were made really well and the presentation was beautiful. The overly sweet Blueberry sauce ruined it for me. I would order pancakes again, but with a different topping."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place at least 4 stars because the food was delicious! Unfortunately the service took my rating down a bit. Service was very slow and our waitress barely checked on us. Other than that the food lived up to the hype of the pictures. The blueberry pancakes and chicken and waffles were amazing! If I knew my next time visiting would have faster service, I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This is not a brunch review, but a lunch review. It is clearly a popular lunch spot for those people who work in the area during the week.  The restaurant is cavernous, with  high ceilings, the tables are very close together, and with the piped music the ambient noise is high. It is the opposite of a quiet intimate spot: it is a clattering efficient come in have a quick lunch leave, sort of place.  The food is expensive for what you get. Nevertheless, it is good. We had an mountainous kale salad with Quinoa and walnuts. You would have to be a complete herbivore in order to get through it all. The avocado that came with it was large and delicious, perfectly ripe.  They charged an additional two dollars for hot sauce, really? The chicken was covered in herbs and somewhat dry but well grilled. The leak and potato soup which looked rather like brown sludge and arrived cold was taken away because it was cold... And we weren't charged.  The service was pleasant and enthusiastic as well as being efficient."}
{"text":"After a long, but expected 1.5 hr wait, we we're finally seated on Easter weekend. As per usual, I ordered everything on the menu: chicken waffles, buttermilk pancakes, and the cheesy bacon french toast. If my taste buds could orgasm it would have thanked me for the amount of greatness it felt when I bit into all the gluttony goodness. It was porn in my mouth, literally I moaned with every bite lol. I'm a sucker for sweet and savory, so I was in my happy place. The chicken was nice and crispy, not oily and seasoned perfectly with a kick of spice hidden under the maple syrup mix. Pancakes were a little disappointing to be honest, not buttery or milky but rather doughy and dry. I had to drown it in syrup and whipped cream to get through one and had taken the rest home. Cheesy bacon hit core to my heart. Read the ingredients, its cheese combined with bacon, on french toast soaked in maple syrup. If you didn't salivate reading that we cant be friends. Our waiter was really upbeat and friendly. He listed the drink specials, and recommended best drinks to order. I opted for a lavender mimosa, delish!! Overall, aside from the regret of calories I had in one sitting, I'm pretty damn happy with School. Best school I've been too yet hah!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was really polite, the only reason they're getting a 2 and not a 1. We waited about 45 minutes for our food. I got the crispy chicken sandwich it was really bland, and dry and the fries were cold.... the theme of the restaurant was cool, but a serious disappointment."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go here for brunch this past weekend. I've been to this location before so my review is based on two visits. Overall the look of the restaurant and the ambiance is amazing. I absolutely love the theme amongst the whole restaurant from the Apple on the table to the chalkboards outside... It's a really fun environment to be in. The food was also good, not the absolute best but good. I would recommend giving this restaurant a shot mainly if you want to go somewhere to take some really cool pictures but keep in mind that the food isn't amazing. Another thing to note is that the servers are very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! and very cute servers (specially the one in the white hat!) Had their Krispy crunch French toast paired with a mimosa (juicy lunch lady) made with fresh blood orange juice and it was one of the best brunches I've had in years"}
{"text":"Foods great , love the atmosphere, great themed items to incorporate the name ... Must try place"}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere that has little items that truly tie in the \"school\" theme. Definitely give this place a try if you are looking for insta-worthy food pics.   I went with a group on a work day for lunch and we were able to be seated right away. The place is small so if you are going at a peak time (eg. the weekend), make sure to make a reservation or arrive early.   The food items we ordered was the chicken n waffles, the blue n black flapjacks and the cheddar n bacon French toast. The chicken n waffles was moist for white chicken and flavourful. However, the waffle was nothing special. The cheddar n bacon French toast is something special that takes you on a different road than your typical French toast. It isn't sweet so just enjoy the savoury side of French toast. What's nice about this dish is that it comes with a side salad that helps cut the fatty side of the French toast. The blue n black flapjacks are definitely worth the insta pic, however, this dish get very sugary after the second pancake.  The service was amazing, with our server always coming around for coffee top ups (big plus) and always answering our questions."}
{"text":"Always busy during brunch, which is always a good sign about the food but constantly trying to get a hold of the wait staff. I keep coming back for the Super Cheesy French Toast! The sides are always seem to be the back burner of the dish and could use some work. Coffee is good and love their peanut butter banana smoothie. Bakery is terrific.  The burger... I love that it's organic beef but it's too pepper corny. It takes away from the rest of the burger."}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a lot of my friends who love brunch and hipster breakfast joints.  I kept playing hooky until finally I was called into the Principals office for being a punk student. When I walked in here it definitely goes with the entire theme.  Everything from the books (do kids even have books anymore?) to the clocks all set at 3pm (SCHOOLS OUT BITCHES!!) and to all of the graded letters on the wall....I was kind of disappointed they didnt have the most common letters I saw when I went to school which were \"D\" and \"F\" but I guess this school encourages everyone to do well.   Being back in school made me really want a drink so I ordered the Vodka Lemonade cocktail and it was so good I had to order another one. My classmates ordered Pancakes, Chicken and waffles, and I got the Safe Bet because I knew I could not afford another failing grade on Brunch. They were all spectacular and made to A++ Perfection. The fries were on point and were a nice side order.  This School is definitely not cheap and I can tell you that you get nothing but the highest quality of Ivy League Food education here. I will be back for Detention next time and maybe even use my Spare and get a Hall Pass to dine here."}
{"text":"Probably would've given this place 4 stars if it weren't for the ridiculously long wait. A table of 3 was about an hour and 15 minute wait on a Sunday.  I had ordered their Pecan Pancakes ($16.50) and their Pear Basil freshly squeezed juice ($6). The Pancakes were delicious but quite filling. I only finished half of my order!! The marscopone creme on top of the pancakes was to die for. The Pancakes itself were light, soft and fluffy and paired quite well with the creme and the maple syrup on the side.  To be honest, my friend ordered the croissant with eggs and smoked salmon and I found that MUCH tastier than the Pancakes. The Pancakes were too filling for me, whereas the croissant came with a small salad and a healthy serving of smoke salmon. The smoked salmon wasn't too salty and balanced the sweetness of the pastry. The egg in the middle was airy and gave a perfect bite every time.  Overall, I'd choose to come here again and SHARE my croissant and pancakes with someone."}
{"text":"Outstanding brunch place. Weekend line up in the morning can be crazy. Make sure you get there by 10am if you don't want to wait for an hour while starving."}
{"text":"Second time time. First time was amazing. Poutine for breakfast? Absolutely! Must try. Add pull pork and the tomato jelly is sweetness that adds a perfect balance to the savory.   Second time here. Pancakes were very dense, it happens. Felt bad for sending it back but if you're gonna charge $13 for pancakes. It should be amazing. They offered to remake but a really long time and complete buzz kill waiting.   Hostess was a little short and borderline rude (nose ring was interesting) First point of contact important for any service driven business. No business should take their clientele for granted. It was just an off day for us. Our waitress not very good. The manage was quite awesome.   If you don't mind the long wait for food, I think it's worth a try if it's a place in your agenda. If it's a Sunny day and you're on the patio, get partial shade. It gets hot out here!"}
{"text":"Heard rave reviews about this place so we went for brunch. Very trendy, cool decor, friendly and quick staff. I ordered the Huevos 101 which was great and the boyfriend ordered the Salmon salad which was disappointing for him because he found it to be a random mix of food.  If you're looking for simple, easy, inexpensive brunch this is not the place. If you're looking to splurge a little bit for brunch with girls, or for an occasion or date in a great location this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great location with a cute patio.  They have a great Bully burger with a ton of meat covered in guacamole mmm! So YUMMY!   Slightly expensive but reasonable for Liberty Village. In my experience it's very busy on the weekend so you have to arrive early or wait in line."}
{"text":"When you walk into School, you immediately feel a cool vibe from the trendy decor and laid back atmosphere. The clocks on the wall and an apple on each table are a great touch.  I was particularly hungry on a Friday at lunch, needing the extra energy and a pick-me-up to get through the rest of the work day. I ordered a mimosa-type drink where I was able to select the type of juice to accompany the prosecco. I opted for the raspberry blueberry juice and was not disappointed. I wish I ordered 5, but had to get back to work.  The chicken and waffles were very filling, but nothing special. The chicken was juicy inside and crispy on the outside, but was bland. The syrup tasted like a sweeter and spicier version of sweet and sour sauce - I didn't particularly like the combination with the waffle. The maple butter was by far the best thing on my plate.  This is a good spot to eat if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine here again."}
{"text":"Went two days in a row!! Sooo yummy wish it wasn't so far away from me"}
{"text":"I went to School this weekend, hehe, I just wanted to say that...  I thought it was overrated.  I was excited to go, since it was rated a top brunch spot to go.  The atmosphere is funky and cool, right in the heart of Liberty Village, but meh.    EGGS BENNI with BACON: it was just a plain ol' eggs benni.  I thought it was a touch on the runny side, with the egg yolk and the Hollandaise Sauce... Home fries were meh...  friend #1 had... EGG WHITE FRITATTA with SHRIMP.  This was quite delicious I had to admit when I tried a bite of hers, if you go, order this, it's the best we had.  Full of flavour and shrimp is good in the omlette.   friend #2 had... POTATO SAUSAGE OMLETTE.  It wasn't anything special.  friend #3 had... OVERSTUFFED CROISSANT OF SMOKED SALMON AND SPICY SCRAMBLED EGGS.  Holy moley, spicy, spicy, spicy.  If your looking to get an ulcer in the AM, get this.  On a hot day, not the way to go!  Tried some sides...  MAPLE CRANBERRY SAUSAGE: the sausage that keeps on giving. It was so rich and compacted to the point where it felt a little dry.  BACON: tasted like regular bacon, nothing special  Overall: - Good ambiance - Friendly staff - Good BAKED goods - Overpriced (breakfast is a relatively cheap to make) - Food was mediocre at best.  Good thing I had great company!"}
{"text":"The breakfast portions are small and very unsatisfying. There is ONE item with eggs in it on the menu. Worst of all was the customer service. When the hostess thought we were seated before our full party arrived (in fact, a friend walked away to take a work call) the hostess very rudely told us to get back in line. When we explained the fourth friend was about 2 feet away, she just stormed away. I've never felt the urge to review a brunch place because that's an easy meal that doesn't disappoint, but School is overrated and has awful, awful customer service. Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"I love this place for weekend brunches. The atmosphere is great, the food is creative and extremely good.  They actually have proper tea's. Desserts are great.  The only bad thing is the line, expect to wait 30 min during prime brunch hours on the weekend."}
{"text":"This past weekend I went back to SCHOOL.  Long gone are the bullies of my adolescence, though if you take a look around the room cliques are still everywhere.  Cheerleaders have been replaced by servers donning tartan-printed school girl uniforms and geeks have been replaced by hipsters.  Overall, a very young and trendy crowd.    I love the school-themed decor with the plain looking school clocks plastered against one and library shelves filled with booze instead of books.    The wait at 12:45PM wasn't excruciatingly long for our table of 4 but tables for 2 seemed to be a different story.    For those of you who don't know, there is FREE parking on weekends towards the rear of the restaurant - don't be tricked into paying for parking at the Green P.    Pitchers (called flasks here) are available and we opted for a flask of Orange Mimosa ($35) - a very expensive pitcher of Fanta :p  There are a daily selection of baked goods available so be sure to ask your server about those.  These range from cookies to scones.  We ate:  Krispy French Toast with Orange Infused Honey & Whipped Brown Sugar Butter ($12) - with flecks of Rice Krispies coating the bread.  The citrus honey was a nice departure from the usual maple syrup.  Absolutely delicious!  Spanish Scramble ($14) with Chorizo, Caramelized Onions, Tomatoes & Pepper Jack Cheese with Cheddar Chive Biscuit & Pumpkin Seed Greens - the Chorizo wasn't the best and there was almost too much going on in this omelet for you to taste the flavours.  I probably wouldn't order it again.  Melted Gooey Four Cheese Omelet Souffle ($14) with Home Fries & Greens - I added the bacon for $3 more.  Their menu reads \"the best bacon in the city\" - that's not false advertising, even if it is on the side of embellishing.  Light and airy with gooey CHEESE and extremo tasty home fries.  Definitely recommend!  Super Cheesy French Toast with Double Smoked Bacon, Maple Syrup & Greens ($13) - I wasn't a fan of the sweet and savoury combo in this case.  While it wasn't bad, I felt the cheese and maple syrup were clashing like a mismatched outfit.  It didn't taste horrible but it didn't quite go right together.    Side of Maple Sausages ($5) - Sweet and savoury done right (redemption for the Super Cheesy French Toast).  Not too oily, with a hint of sweetness that doesn't overpower the saltiness of the sausage.  NB.  The greens that accompanied the dishes were underwhelming to say the least.    At the end of the day, the damage was about $35 each.  This place was packed and therefore, servers were running around all over the place and not always available when you needed them.  I will definitely be back for some more brunchin' and to reminisce about my school days..."}
{"text":"Such a fun and lively brunch restaurant. I had the pecan and basil mascarpone pancakes. The pancakes were so light and fluffy while the basil marscapone was definitely the perfect spread. My girlfriends who ordered different things were also very satisfied -- they ordered the super cheesy bacon french toast and the bacon cheddar burger. With this said, I think it's safe to say to just order what your heart desire as the food is probably going to be well done.  BONUS: the interior has a 90s vibe if you dig that kind of stuff."}
{"text":"Amazing Brunch. Excellent Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie."}
{"text":"This place is very trendy, which makes sense as it's located in Liberty Village. I've been here twice. The first time was horrible because we had to wait for nearly 2 hours. The second time was a lesser wait time. Unfortunately, they don't have reservations, only walk-ins. However, it's totally worth the wait. They also have a cramped setting for seats. Everything is very cute, following a school house theme. The food is so rich and heavenly. Definitely not for the health concious eater. I would recommend the breakfast poutine. It's a savoury dish that has braised leeks, sunny egg, tomato jam and gravy. I love my brunches, and this place is on my list of faves."}
{"text":"For me the most important part of a good brunch place is how good their coffee is and School served one of the best cups of coffee in the city. Everyone at our table really enjoyed what they ordered. My cheesy french toast was delicious.  Our only complaint was the service... We had a super friendly waiter, but he tended to forget stuff. He was very apologetic and didn't charge one person for coffee and threw in a side of bacon for another person at our table. None of us were in a hurry so it really didn't bother us too much.   I will definitely go back, but this isn't a place to go if you want to grab brunch in a hurry."}
{"text":"Despite the long wait, this place is definitely worth the hype. Love their mix of childish favorites with an upscale twist. School is a gem hidden in Liberty Village, one I would highly recommend taking your foodie friend to impress ;). Try their captain crunch french toast... it's terribly good."}
{"text":"The School Restaurant in Liberty Village is a great brunch place with a retro feel. The design of the restaurant tips a hat to retro classrooms and cafeterias. Juices and drinks are served in flasks - a novel touch. The pop is served in retro glass bottles. The service is attentive.  The restaurant serves traditional brunch food with a twist. I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was savory - crunchy outside and soft and juicy inside. The waffles are fluffy and sweet. The dish comes with maple syrup mixed with sriracha - sweet and spicy. The contracting flavours are works well together.   During a hot summer day, I would recommend sitting on the patio."}
{"text":"I had been waiting to go to school for a long time. Wow, I think thats the first time I've ever said that, although now being a full-time work bot, I miss the days of fluctuating schedules, morning sleep ins and summers off. *Deep Exhalation*.  I was never the best student in school...but when it comes to food, I'm an eager teacher's pet. Ready to soak in everything there is to learn.  Before heading over to School Bakery & Cafe, there was a lot of hype from friends who loved this Liberty Village jaunt.  A few weeks back, on one of those fluke nice weather days, my partner and I jumped on our bikes and went on an adventure across the lakeshore. Not too long after we were hungry...we're not much of the sporty types. We veered our bikes in the direction of Liberty Village and decided we would 'take a break' for some brunch. I was pleasantly surprised by the decor. It wasn't overtly school cliche, but played with iconic items. An apple on each table, the menu written on lined school paper, girls dressed in American Apparel esque school uniforms, projection screen playing  Betty Boop, and a few school items adorned on the walls. It was the perfect use of school. But now the important part, how did they interpret school on their menu. I was scared I'd see cafeteria favorites like: jamaican patties, subs, poutine, and dehydrated burgers...But of course not. School's menu is a creative interpretation of brunch classics.   We ordered: FRESH SQUEEZED JUICES - Pineapple & Mint and he got Grapefruit. Really good. It's actually 100% juice. Nothing better in the afternoon then a juice kick.  SMOKED SALMON ENDIVE SALAD which came with a Fried Egg, Home Fries in a warm Lemon-Dill Vinaigrette. I was surprised by the generous portion of salmon. It was a loaded salad but the flavors complimented each other; the endive balancing the creaminess of the other ingredients. Who would have thought to put home fries in their salad - Must have been a smart student.  PARMESAN-ASPARAGUS OMELET with Cracked Pepper, Home Fries & Greens. Enjoyed this all around. Egg was fluffy and was perfectly cooked. Love when its all yellow without any burns...hard to find in brunch spots. Would order this again.  I kept eyeing the spread of fresh baked goods on the counter but I had a long ride ahead of me and I don't think a gooey chocolate chip cookie would have served me so well. May have had to take another one of those 'breaks'. The bill came in a report card. How appropriate. Except this time I know I was a very good student! No 'S' or 'NI' for me! For School, I give them a G to VG for ambiance and food. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before for brunch. Each visit was always great and the food was delicious. I've tried the chicken waffles, the blueberry pancakes and the hash brown poutine..you can't go wrong with those! So I definitely would recommend those dishes.   One thing is that the wait is ridiculously long! So it's better to come as soon as they open. However, they do take down names on their iPad and will notify you by text once a table is available. But even when your table is ready..they still need 5-10 mins for the customers to pay and clean the table."}
{"text":"The space is small so if your in a large group it might be awkward.   I would definitely recommend the French toast.  I got the French toast and the chicken & waffles. Hands down the best French toast I have had, the chicken and waffles were good too but nothin special."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food. -1 star for the wait. Sigh. This is what happens when a popular restaurant doesn't take reservations.   Sunday morning. 11:30am, there was already a huge line up leading to the patio outside.  With two huge groups inside, they do take up quite a bit of space, so the parties of 2-4s had the extra wait because of this.   After about an 1 hour wait in line, we finally got seated.  The food came in decent time, no complaints there.   What I like is the super diverse menu. Everything on here appeals to me, and makes me want to come back.   We got the mango smoothie and the jungle fruit smoothie which looked pretty similar and I'm surprised if they didn't taste the same.  The jungle fruit was a little watery and actually tasted like mango. 2 stars  The coffee was okay. They claim it's Illy, but it was a bit watery as well. And no one came to ask me to top it off.   The mains were great.  I got the Spicy Eggs Bennie on a Cheddar Scone and Chipotle Hollendaise. ($12)  Yum. It was a great twist on a classic, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  Not a bad price point either. 4 stars  There was also the to die for Crunch French Toast with Brown Sugar Butter. It was very sweet, and I love the Rice Kirspy baked on and caramelized on the top to give it the crunch kick. However, the Challah wasn't soaked enough to grab all the egg flavour. 3 stars.  The Parmasean Asparagus Omlette was light and fluffy and comes with a salad.   Overall, it was a great place, and I would come back - but be prepared for the over and hour wait, or come back on a weekday."}
{"text":"If the food here was really great, then I wouldn't mind waiting over an hour for our food.  Food is good, not great, so I'd prefer to go elsewhere like Mildred's Kitchen - get same, if not better food, and have it arrive in 15 mins.    The place was only 2/3rds full on a Sunday morning but it was moving at a snails pace.  After we if finished our meal, the waiter said, oh sorry I forgot your goodies appetizer!  Ya right, wait another hour, no thanks.   Then because we have 6 people we are forced to give 18% tip!  The tip should express our displeasure."}
{"text":"Uniquely themed brunch place. Food and fruits are very fresh, the staff are all friendly. There is a wait time, we were told 45-50 minutes but got seated before that."}
{"text":"Came for an afternoon dinner. So good! Order the chicken and waffles. Alessia was our server and she was super sweet and very accommodating. Made some great recommendations for us since it's our first time in Toronto. The waffles were a little on the too sweet side but it wasn't anything to take away from the 5 stars. Great decision coming here!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this restaurant and was left disappointed. Long line to wait for a table; which is ok but they never tell you to sign in with them or come down the line to ask for names. Pricey food for food that didn't quite deserve it. I ordered the pancakes and was told it would be a bit longer for our food since there was some kind of hold up with pancake orders (a staple on the menu). A bit of a hold up was an understatement. I was ready to leave when it finally came. People that had been seated after us had eaten and left before our order arrived."}
{"text":"Hubby and wifey bravely checked this place out for brunch on a Saturday with their little porkiebun. Wait time was supposedly half hour but thankfully the wait wasn't that long.   Everything in their menu looks so tempting that hubby and wifey had no choice but to indulge! Hubby had the Bacon Cheddar Burger with fries on the side. Nothing extraordinary really for the price you pay. Wifey got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken + waffles with slaw on the side. Chicken was slightly overseasoned but was still pretty good in combination with the delicious syrup and brown sugar butter. Slaw was underwhelming. Hubby and wifey also shared their Super Fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes, which absolutely did not disappoint. Loved that brown sugar butter!  Would definitely want to come back and try other items from their menu."}
{"text":"Just celebrated my birthday here with friends & family this past Sunday.   This place is kind of part \"Hipster Heaven\", what with it's industrial decor and $15 eggs, but what, pray tell, is with the waitresses dressed as school girls?   Yeah, I get it, smart ass, it's called \"School Bakery\" and you get your cheque in the form of a \"report card\" and there are apples on the table which, given the ridiculous length of time I waited for my breakfast, I was oft tempted to eat, but wasn't sure if they'd been coated in some kind of shellac or whatnot, and therefore didn't.   But, real talk, I find the school girl outfits off-putting. A little Pink Floyd-ish, a little \"The Craft\"ish. Like, ew.   Had the \"Spiced Benni\" which, once the clock struck midnight and it turned 2015 and arrived at the table, was pretty good. Not that spicy, though, which is fine by me. But if you're a discerning palette and want things hotter than hell for breakfast, this is not the right choice. The cheddar-herb biscuit it was served on was delicious, but a bit doughy and a bit gargantuan. But seeing them rising in that cute little oven was heart-warming and made me think of Christmas, grandmothers, elves and Cindy Loo-Who. Yes, in that order.   We were with a large group, which I don't recommend. It might be better as a one-on-one place, because the menu is lovely - sweet and savoury options- and they have a pretty diverse beverages menu, complete with fresh-squeezed orange juice and smoothies.   I'm not saying it's not worth a try, but they must do something about those uniforms."}
{"text":"Overpriced and not even that good. I'm really surprised that breakfast for two with no drinks came to 50 bucks. These guys are out of touch."}
{"text":"We've only ever been here for brunch, but both times, it's been pretty good, and not super-crazy-busy like so many other places are that serve a meal that can't decide what it wants to be.  Menu not particularly huge, which I appreciate, so we've basically had it all, and I'd say I could happily order any item and be very satisfied.  We'll be returning."}
{"text":"If school was this good, I probably would've went to more classes. One of many brunch options in Liberty Village, this place is dressed like a school with lockers and coat hooks that will bring you right back to your school days.   The food is your classic brunch options, but they do their own spin on classics like French toast and pancakes. My friend and I got the savoury French toast and the fried chicken and waffles. Both of these were rich but very satisfying.   They've got plenty of indoor and outdoor seating so  make the most of the nice summer weather and take a seat on the patio."}
{"text":"Went to this place on a whim before a TFC game because we were hungry, it was close, and we were in a hurry. Didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The school theme is really apparent throughout the restaurant. Chalk boards, apples on the table, the menu looks like lined paper and is on a clipboard, some drinks are served in beakers and the waitresses are dressed in cute kilts. The patio is not huge but is very nice as well.  I ordered the rosé sangria which was served in a beaker and was quite good. They also have red and white sangria and it`s all by the glass or pitcher which is nice. I also ordered the Mexican jalapeno chicken with buttered corn and biscuits and it was incredible. Did not expect to enjoy something as simple as chicken so much but it was cooked and spiced PERFECTLY.  The prices aren't so cheap but that's a very minor complaint as they're hardly unreasonable. I'll surely be back the next time I'm in Liberty Village."}
{"text":"Great food!  If you are going for brunch, go early as the wait can sometimes be extremely long.  It is definitely worth the wait.  The French Toast is amazing."}
{"text":"It's true what Spence said, I came on a sat afternoon during lunch, there was no wait for a table but the food took an hour to come! I know because we had to renew our parking! We ate in 10 mins! But the food took forever! And honestly was not even worth the wait. The juices are premade and comes from a jug ($5.50) a small cup. The food was not worth the wait or coming back a second time. The only good thing was the large parking lot right in front of the place."}
{"text":"It was just okay. I think this place is too hyped up. Wait time took approximately 10-15mins, not patio because that would of taken longer. We ordered the blueberry pancakes and bacon and eggs with a side of waffle. We also added the sausages and jalapeños hash. I think both the sides were pretty good, but the jalapeño sour cream should of been served separately as it was quite spicy and I couldn't even avoid it as it was ontop of the hash. The pancakes definitely LOOKED fluffy and was instagram worthy. I think that's what sucked lost girls into ordering it. However it's not fluffy, it's dense and quite cake like. I've had better. I couldn't even finish it despite the price because it was so filling and it was so dense. Service was definitely lacking. We had to wait forever (40 min) for our food which was served cold to us. When we were done we had to wait another 30min for our bill and for the machine. Our waitress saw us gave us eye contact and nodded, I assumed she'd come and check up on us. However she just went to get food and eat behind the bar so we just ended going to the front to ask for the machine to pay. It was a disappointing end to. We spent like $70 here for brunch when service and food was just not up to par."}
{"text":"The sign reads \"lost children will be given an espresso and a free puppy.\"    I can attest to their ability to pull together a full breakfast, from the good hot coffee, to the cheesy omelettes. They have a lot of batter-type things on the menu - pancakes, waffles, etc., which is not celiac friendly, but they have a Chili-Chip omelette that is 100% gluten-free and is delish (omelette stuffed with veggie chilli and cheddar cheese), served alongside a nice side salad. You just have to make sure the kitchen knows if you have any food allergies.   School is cool!"}
{"text":"Very satisfied with their food flavour wise and presentation wise. Will definitely come back if I get the chance. Id give their service was two thumbs up as well. Good job!"}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes are amazing as for the rest of the menu I'm not completely impressed. The service is extremely slow every time and pretty much spend about 1 hour waiting for the food and then add another hour waiting for the bill. On the plus side this place has great coffee and desserts so if you work in the area it's a good spot to run in and pick up a coffee and a treat."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday afternoon for brunch and it was quite packed (luckily we made a reservation!). Atmosphere of the restaurant was very aesthetic and the decor gave off a very rustic feel. Service was quite quick...we were seated immediately and our server always came by to check on us. However, our food took a very long time but, I guess its understandable given how popular the place is. I ordered the blueberry and blackberry flapjacks. They were absolutely PHENOMENAL! I particularly liked the brown sugar butter as it added a great taste to the pancakes. We also ordered the smoked salmon salad and a side of fries which were delicious The portion for the salad was very large so we took the rest home. Overall, I loved this place and I will definitely be back. Highly recommend to make reservations before you go as it will be very packed!"}
{"text":"Simple reason for a one star... u cant modify your food? Ordering a burger without bacon is a right. Specially when its a religious reason...you cant say u cant remove it cuz its ur policy! What kind of customer service is this?"}
{"text":"$20 for chicken and waffles. You get three pieces of boneless chicken well-fried and delicious. The breakfast is definitely worth it. However a 90-minute wait for Sunday brunch is what we had to go through to engage in said deliciousness. Service was quick. Would certainly recommend visiting on a non-weekend day for good eats. Their $13 Cesars are also delicious!"}
{"text":"School has taken this space to the next level.  This restaurant used to be the Warehouse Grill.  Warehouse was chaotic trying to serve cafeteria style and still make custom-made quality food.    School has realized that vision.  They've introduced table service, narrowed the menu a bit and introduced decadent deserts and snacks.  Note: they can get really busy, and when they are, they don't deal with it well (read: expect to wait)."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, heard good things about this place.    The service was terrible, and just about the worst I've ever experienced in this city.  This is directed towards our server who should not be allowed to serve in any restaurant.  Our hostess was great, attentive and made us laugh.  We complained about the coffee multiple times and server told us no one else has complained.  The coffee tasted like water.  And replaced our coffee from a fresh pot, which still tasted like water.  How can you be known for brunch place and serve such terrible coffee, is beyond me.  The food was good and their was attention to detail and quality ingredients is the only positive thing I can say.  But we waited over hour to get our food...need I say anymore.  Because of the service, the length of time we had to wait for our food, and the terrible coffee I will never return to this place."}
{"text":"When we went, there was a huge line. So i would definitely suggest making reservations or go early.   Bf had the chicken and waffles and I had the omelette souffle. Don't think this is a healthy restaurant. It's not.  So don't come here if you're looking for a light option. All the food is pretty heavy imo.   I love the theme and the ambiance of this restaurant. It's very much like a school. I love when a restaurant sticks to their theme."}
{"text":"Really fun atmosphere, and the staff were great, but the food was lacklustre. Ordered the sirloin rare and I received it medium. I don't think it was a sirloin either. Avoid the quinoa risotto, does not taste good. Delicious bruschetta and biscuits though. If they could fix the mains 2 stars goes to 4. Also expect a significant wait before you receive your food."}
{"text":"It has been a long time coming for myself and best friend to visit \"School\". We are unofficially on the hunt to eat our way through all of the brunch places in Liberty Village. We were so thankful that because of the cold, rainy weather we walked straight into School and we were seated right away. Instantly we were both in awe of the vibe and decor. Definitely hipster central - there were antique expresso machines as decor, books on the shelve, graded papers lining the light fixtures. \"Saved by the Bell\" was playing on the televisions which gave me flashbacks to my mornings before elementary school.   We were seated to our table where they had an apple as decor (didn't look like anyone was actually eating them). The theme of the restaurant runs heavily, right into the menu with punny food names and the milk for your coffee coming in a beaker! We appreciated the commitment.  Now for the important stuff - food. So I've heard that the Black and Blue flapjacks were very popular but I'm a traditional girl at heart. Both my bestie and got their traditional breakfast option called the \"Safe Bet\". Half a Belgium waffle with brown butter, scrambled eyes with creme fresh and chives and bacon. I know it sounds basic but it was AMAZING. A classic elevated for sure. To be honest though, while we both left full I felt like I was missing potatoes or something. Also, the prices were higher than I anticipated - between $16-$25 per plate, so bare that in mind. You are paying for an experience.   All in all, we will be back to School Resto soon!"}
{"text":"I was joining some friends for sunday brunch in Liberty Village and heard many good things.  Maybe it was the hype but I was somewhat disappointed.  We had a group of 8 and with walk-ins only, we asked to be split into 2 tables of 4. We ended up waiting close to an hour but saved of the mandatory gratuity of 6+.  With such a wait, my expectations were high especially with the long wait in line for the table. The conversation with my friends was great and the staff didn't rush us despite more patrons waiting. It was maybe the other table in our group was still eating. They serve alcohol starting at 11 am but most of us ordered their juice. I wasn't too impressed with the juice considering the price tag.  My food order was the smoked salmon salad.  They were generous with the portions but lack the taste in the salad. Maybe I should have asked for more dressing.  My table mates were happy with the chicken & waffles but I wanted something healthier that day.   Although it was raining, I noticed they had a patio and offered a dinner menu for the weekends.  I may give one more chance. On Sundays before 1 pm, you can find some free street parking near the restaurant. If not, Lampert stadium had a parking lot."}
{"text":"I went to School Restaurant recently with 2 friends who had raved about going there before. The first obstacle was that we went for Sunday brunch and waited about 45min for a table, probably due to the rain causing the patio to close. Normally I would not wait if I was alone, but I was willing. Once inside, the place was crowded of course, very noisy, and far more trendy than I care for.  The food however was fine. I had the Cheesy Bacon French Toast. Thick french toast, lots of cheese and bacon, maple syrup, and green salad on the side. My friends had a mixed skillet meal, which was good, but apparently not as good as their first visit. With drinks, the bill was about $25/person.  Admittedly, the food was good, but the atmosphere was not what I want for breakfast. There was assorted school memorabilia, which should have appealed to the nostalgia in me, but it seemed more like they were trying too hard to build a theme restaurant. Overall, I would say not my kind of place, but okay for a one-time visit."}
{"text":"Very good, a bit pricey but your also getting a feeling of being bad at school.  The music is a kick back to the 90's biggie, DMX, snoop.....ya listened to that back in tha day? Ya gonna feel right at home.    I came here for the chicken and waffles....I left full and very happy. Tha slaw had a spicy bite to it but it seemed to go with the meal. Even thou it looked like there was bone in, it was in fact boneless. The butter was a nice change on the side which it was infused with maple I believe. Fluffy waffles and crispy chicken delight.    I would definitely come back here but maybe later on seeing how it is a hoping place. My Daughter and I  got here at about 1:45 on a Saturday and there was a 45 min wait to sit. Luckily there was seating at the bar and the food was received within 15 of ordering."}
{"text":"So the concept of the restaurant is cool and the food itself is great however the service ruined it for me not only did we get checked on a total of 3 times but it took about 20-25 min to get my bill and pay for everything. But the saving grave was the amazing pancakes & chicken and waffles. Its worth checking out for those food items but the service left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Was visiting the area for holidays and went to this place (wish we picked another one). The place is okay (or worse), but way overpriced in relation to the quality of the food. The worst part is the service - it is absolutely terrible. The waitress was extremely rude and \"demanded\" high tip... bye bye School Restaurant - will definitely stay away..."}
{"text":"School's current average rating of 3.5 stars is spot-on. The atmosphere here is cool, unique, and playful - way better than any school environment I've ever been in. The theme runs well throughout the restaurant with drinks and syrups served in beakers, fake grass padding some of the picnic tables in their patio area, a wall of clocks (like those you'd see in a typical school), chandeliers with papers hovering near the lights, shelves with books and pieces near the bar, and an envelope with your bill - your \"individual progress report\" served at the end.   At the time my friend and I went, she ordered a Brunch Bowl ($18.00) and I ordered the good ol' classic insta-worthy Black & Blue flapjacks ($16.00). The brunch bowl was plated and served nicely with tortilla slivers and a sunny-side up egg on top of the main goods. It was an overall delicious dish that made my friend full (and we entered with empty stomachs) however it was missing something to make it an amazing one. The flapjacks are oh-so-good and are stacked high. They're fluffy too which I prefer and are served with a side of brown sugar butter, vanilla whip cream, and Ontario maple syrup. These are definitely recommended for those with a sweet tooth and a love of pancakes - both of which I have.   School is a must-try - it's especially nice checking out during patio season because the patio area is well-shaded with umbrellas and some sections lining the walls come with comfy pillows. Service is relatively quick considering the amount of people that were there and the food aesthetic is beautiful. School gives you better treatment that you'd find in any school and the food is beyond cafeteria-quality."}
{"text":"Love love love the chicken and waffles. Definitely worth the hype! The salads are also really good and are surprisingly filling. My favourite is the Roasted Cauliflower (with School's famous fried chicken of course). One thing that could use improvement would be the service...the servers are sometimes inattentive and it can take a while to get your bill. Overall, if you are in the area, definitely stop by School. You will not regret it!"}
{"text":"The blueberry flapjacks were amazing, the batter used is different from traditional pancakes, these are definitely much more filling than regular pancakes!  The poutine was flavorful, the potatoes were a little mushy, and cheese curds are a little lacking, but overall okay!  The bread used for the cheesy French toast was really good, but the cheese and bacon were just average, would have been nice to have more bacon!  Get here by 10:00 on Sundays, we saw a huge line as we left at 10:45!"}
{"text":"For 1 scone, cheesy toast and a blood orange drink, it cost $38. The restaurant floor was very dirty, no place to hang jackets or purses. concept is cute, restaurant décor and detail to the ambiance. Service was slow, and 30min wait time for a table on a Sunday morning. Loud Blaring Hip Hop music, could not conversate without yelling. Wont be coming here again. Many other breakfast spots worth going to before this one."}
{"text":"You walk into this small restaurant and have something to reminisce with all of your friends about. The decor is strictly grade school themed, it's great. I came in a large group of 9 and we were greeted with open arms.   I only had some green tea and the Black n Blue Flapjacks, it was pretty. I enjoyed the shot of syrup than I slathered my bites of pancakes with. The food was delicious and make great models for instagram photos.   The only downside is when you look at the prices of the food, it is expensive."}
{"text":"One visit for lunch and I really want to go back! The choices on the menu were really fantastic  - from soups to salads and sandwiches to Mexican and more - I had a hard time deciding what to order. Everyone I was with was really happy with their choices, and we all had different dishes.  The service was also really good for weekday lunch, which was moderately busy. I haven't been for the brunch on weekends, which sounds like the craziest time. I love the patio! Can't wait for my return visit."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quiet patio this is the restaurant. With at least 60% of their entire seating situated outdoors, you're ensured an spot on the patio. The food was ok and the service was ok."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Best place for breakfast it's a good place to go in Toronto. Prices are good, quality food is good and plates are enough to don't be hungry  for 6 hours"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and atmosphere at School. I'm glad I gave this place a try but was a little disappointed. I odered fried chicken and waffles with flap jacks.  The food was really good but had better elsewhere. And I also found it to be a bit over priced.  That with the long wait to get the food I'll probably not return."}
{"text":"Went on a random Monday around noon and there was no line up. If you work or live close by, this place is a nice brunch spot. It is more pricey than usual brunch places though.   I had the cheesy french toast ($19) that had melted cheese on top, salad and a cute little beaker of maple syrup to pour over the french toast. Yum! French toast was thick and cheese was nicely melted. I saw blueberry pancakes being carried out from the kitchen, which also looked really good.  It is a very busy spot so even at noon on a Monday, the restaurant was mostly filled. Chatter is louder than the music so this place is ideal more for casual lunches/brunches. Customer service is nice if understandably busy. My server did ask if I was allergic to anything (a nice touch) and they checked on me twice with refills of water. At the end of my meal, when I was looking to pay but could not find my server to flag down..one of the staff nearby noticed and helped me out too.   In the end, I was happy with my experience. I would definitely go back if I wanted to splurge as menu is at a higher price point than what I would usually go for."}
{"text":"This is a very trendy spot! It was such a fun place to go for brunch, especially being on vacation. It has a school house theme so the atmosphere and decor is very cool. All of the servers seem to be fun good looking gay men. We got here at 930 on a Sunday morning so we didn't have to wait but as it's creeping to 1030, it's getting pretty full in here. Okay. Now the food! It's the 12 days of Christmas menu and it was so fun!! My sister got the eggnog waffles, I got the Rudolph burger (exactly what you'd imagine it to be) and my other sister got the special which was a beef cheek hash. We were all very pleased. A very unique and fun menu. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to eat here after seeing all the rave reviews on Yelp. Their blueberry pancakes looked amazing in pictures and their outdoor seating area was nice. So we found parking right away and got seated immediately on a Friday. Had to wait forever for a waiter to come around. We actually had to wave down someone to take our order. Finally someone came around and we said we have a question because one of us has allergies. She immediately took on an attitude with us and said she'll get the manager. The manager came and had no sympathy for the fact that the person I was eating with has allergies. She's allergic to blackberries so we asked if the blueberry/blackberry pancakes have blackberries inside the pancakes. He totally misinformed us and said yes they are mixed into the batter and no he cannot hold them. I told him I don't want butter or whipped cream on the pancakes and he's all \"sorry bitch we cannot hold even one item\". He didn't actually say bitch but you know what I mean. I said it would take less time for them to not put on the whipped cream and butter and he's like hell no we can't even modify one item. Really??? It made no sense. As I said it would take way less time to not put on those items. The person I was with didn't order anything because the manager was not able to accommodate her allergies whatsoever. Our pancakes arrived pretty late after ordering and the manager was wrong. There were no blueberries or blackberries inside the batter. If he had informed us correctly we wouldn't have gotten annoyed and just split the pancakes like we had planned. Let me just say that the pancakes look incredible in pictures but were nothing to write home about. They were dry, bland and tasted like bread with blueberry jam on top. Go to school if you want to receive the worst customer service of your life. I'm serious. We left without leaving a tip and we never do that."}
{"text":"School has everything i look for a in a brunch place: Decent wait time, Good Chicken and Waffles, Amazing Pancakes, Great environment and service.  - There was a lineup on Sunday, but nothing too ridiculous, 2 people can get a table within half an hour, maybe even earlier if you don't mind the bar table. Their bar seats were actually pretty comfortable so I would go for the bar seats again.  - So from their Chicken and Waffles, their Waffles were just PERFECT, fluffy and light, and very easy on the stomach. Their chicken, while it wasn't bad, it wasn't as crispy or flavourful as other Fried Chicken joints, but it would do. Their sauce was pretty good as well.  - Pancakes? Best i have ever had! take it with a grain of salt as i am not a super fan of pan cakes in general but I really loved their pancakes, they were very fluffy and they give you a really good maple syrup with it. My girlfriend, who is a fan of pancakes liked it very much as well. One thing to definitely order when you're there.  - Service was pretty quick, the person who was taking care of the wait line offered us the bar seats and we took it. Our server was just behind the bar so we had easy access to her and she kept checking on us.  Will definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"Came here last Tuesday to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. We came around 1 and there was no line-thank the heavens because we were starving. There's ample parking across the street at the green P lot and on the street!  My sister and girlfriend ordered peach-mango mimosas, I got a green tea which was loose leafed which I like rather than the bagged tea. Anyways, I started off with their chive cheddar biscuits (2 of them with 1 order). Honestly, they're your basic biscuit, buttery, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside. But it wasn't anything I haven't tasted before.  My sister got this cheesy, bacony French toast dish. It was HUGE and came with a shot of pure maple syrup and a side of greens. I got their caramel pancake and my girlfriend got their chicken and waffles.  The portion size of the pancakes looks big on other yelpers pictures. But they were smaller but stacked high. The ginger-something sauce on the rims were really delicious (sorry, forgot the name of the sauce). One thing I didn't like was that it didn't come with syrup, I know it has caramel all over, but pancakes aren't pancakes without syrup. The shot of syrup was $2.00 *side eye* The chicken and waffles is your basic fried chicken, nicely seasoned though, and waffles with a shot of syrup. It was tasty.  The show stopper was the cheesy French toast though. UGH so good!! Extreme cheese on a thicker-than-Texas-toast bread. I wish I could've turned back time and ordered it.  Total with tax and tip was a little over $110. Kind of steep for brunch. But it was a good experience!"}
{"text":"Very cute brunch space away from central downtown.. I loved the decor and the outside patio is perfect for Sunday mornings. All of the ingredients tasted really fresh and it was nice to see bakers as soon as we walked in. Love that they serve bottom less Ily coffee!  I would have given five starts except price was a little high and service wasn't great."}
{"text":"One of my friend recommended us trying this place. We came here to grab brunch, and when we got there, we already saw people waiting. Luckily, we were a party of 2 so we didn't have to wait at all, me and my bf both got the buttermilk fried chicken waffles. It was pretty good, the fried chicken was crispy and tender, and with the spicy honey sauce, it was delicious. This was actually my first time having chicken and waffles together, I actually liked it a lot. My bf also ordered regular coffee and maple latte, I tried the maple latte and it was good. Not too sweet with a bit of maple syrup taste. We both got really full after awhile, and we had like a piece of waffle left each. The portion I would say is good, but I would suggest get something different between two people, so u guys can share, so it won't end up being too much food. I would definitely come back here if I visit Toronto again! FYI, by the time we left which was around 1130? The line was out the door, so be prepared to wait a good 40 mins."}
{"text":"Came back & had the cheesy french toast and most of my husbands chicken & waffles. OMG, both were outstanding, I am still talking about it weeks later! The french toast is stuffed with CANDIED BACON - and the waffles are topped with a delish honey-chili syrup. Worth the drive, worth the wait, worth the calories."}
{"text":"Two & a half stars.   Pit stopped back in to School Bakery & Cafe before hitting up the One of A Kind show. Figured it was better to fill our gullets up prior to the hours of walking up and down the aisles of Exhibition Place. The SBC was packed to the rafters and it was easily a waiting time of anywhere between 20-45 minutes. Finally after 35 minutes we got a table for two.   On my last visit I opted for the Big Boss and took that route again. I've always been your basic eggs and bacon kind of girl. For whatever reason my tummy cannot bear the heavy sauce of Eggs Benny so I shy away. Just as well, I'm sure the waistline of my jeans appreciates it as well.   Anyway, I've dropped a star from my previous rating because frankly the scrambled eggs were not cooked. The outside of them were cooked but the inside was sort of runny and that set my stomach off. It's like they tossed them on the grill and let them sit, not breaking them apart as scrambled eggs should be. As well, again, no seasoning on the eggs whatsoever, a point I brought up last time. The platter had no little glass of fruit salad or green salad as stated on the menu and which was what was plated on my last visit here.  I realize they were busy but the people next to us got these sides and we didn't. As well I had to ask for some butter for my herbed biscuit which had some burn char marks on it.   The coffee (Illy) was good. I really want to like this spot for brunch but between ridiculous lineups and inconsistent plates I think I'll start hunting for an alternative downtown brunch go to."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. The wait was about an hour long but totally worth it! Ordered the cinnamon sugar pecan pancakes and the blood orange juice. The pancakes came with a shot of syrup and brown sugar butter! I ate about 2/3s and was completely stuffed. My friend ordered the pancakes as well and she only finished half. You can definitely share this with someone. I'll be back to try that croissant with salmon next time!"}
{"text":"School....it just felt like I did go to \"School\" when I entered the place.  We were 6 of us who went to the School on Sunday around 11:30 am. One of our friend lives 5 minutes away and was on her way when we requested for a table, only to be told by the hostess that we cannot be seated till everyone is not there in person. So we had to wait 5 minutes and then another 10 minutes cos now our seat went to someone who cam after us.  Food - Our server was good and friendly and was quick at taking orders. Not your typical brunch place but food was good. We had limited choices to select from. Ordered the Salmon Scramble sandwich which was good and the Tea cheese and chives tea biscuit that was delicious. However the coffee and iced coffee that my friend ordered was too bitter to our liking and didn't taste fresh.  Overall don't think it was worth the money we paid!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken waffle: 5/5. It's to die for. The brown butter is the perfect pair with the soft puffy waffle, and the chicken is crispy and full of spice, with juicy centre.   Blood orange juice: 4.5/5. Pretty refreshing, would be a good combination with greasy/salty food.  Blueberry pancake: 4/5. Not my personal fav, but people with sweet tooth definitely should try it out.  Fries: 4/5. Nice Cajun touch.  Poutine: 2/5. Literally eating mud."}
{"text":"GIVE ME THOSE CHICKEN & WAFFLES SIR!!!  Great brunch. Always come here when I want a full tummy after a late night.  Came here a few times, didn't enjoy my first plate, but the menu has changed since.   The waffles seem to be most popular.  GET THERE EARLY. Before 11... Or things will get cray and you'll wait shoulder to shoulder listening to which hipster smooshed who last night.  Usually a 30-45min wait during peak hour."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday at 10:15am for a table of 2, they estimated 30-45mins. I walked over to balzac (1block away) to grab a coffee and at 11:15 was texted that my table was rdy. It took me 8minutes to walk back but if you aren't back within 5mins they give your table away even though I replied I was on my way. Nonetheless they put you top of the queue and I waited 10 more mins; not that bad.   The goods: - Cinnamon Pecan Pancakes are amazing! It was a bit dense so I couldnt finish it all but the flavours all together worked really well.  -Bacon Super Cheesy French toast are to DIE for. I killed it all w.o even realizing. Delish!  -Their bacon caesars are so tasty too, definitely recommend.  My friend and I gave each other half of our dish (family style) so the sweet pancakes with savory french toast + tasty refreshing caesar was the perfect brunch combo.   Parking was easy, huge GreenP across. My only issue is that if it's in the fall or winter they should allocated more than 5minutes to walk back because they can't expect people to wait 45-1hr close by outside in the cold. Other than that service was amazing. I enjoyed my time here and would come back a few more times to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food and drinks, awesome staff.   The smoked salmon eggs and the burger were our choices, and both were excellent!  All the food looked and smelled amazing. I also had a mango peach drink that was as good as the food.   This places makes me wish I lived in Liberty Village to go for brunch every weekend!"}
{"text":"Really tasty breakfast this morning! Ordered soft scrambled eggs instead of the over easy standard on the BBQ pulled pork and eggs with tomatillos salsa and sour cream.   Nice hash browns, Jalapeño muffin and some greens rounded out the plate. Not cheap @ $17 but delicious and well cooked. I will be back."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We waited 45mins and we still had no food. I asked 2 separate waiters to follow up our order and they kept telling us we were next. Our waitress had the nerve to tell us to \"I know you're hungry, just be patient\" when I told her two big groups that came at least 15mins after us already got their food and were finished eating. I finally had enough and went to the counter and told the cashier that I was going to pay for our drinks which tasted terrible btw. They weren't fresh since they came from premixed containers and were mixed horribly and I felt was overpriced.  I told him that I had waited close to an hour and he argued with me and told me that the order was only placed 25 minutes ago. I told him that were were sitting since 2pm and it was already 2:50 and people who came after us were done eating. He didn't apologize but just said \"I understand.\" He gave me the bill and asked if we could wait to see his manager. Our waitress comes with the machine and passive aggressively asks if we were in a rush. We all stared at her blankly (it was a Sunday and non of us were in a mood to fight). She just said \"I put your order as soon as you ordered it\" and did not even apologize. Which was a lie because the cashier said it was placed 25 mins ago. I paid and did not leave a tip and she had the nerve to make a face at us. I always leave a tip even when I feel the service is bad as I used to work retail and I understand how stressful it can be.  We waited 5mins for the manager just to be polite and he never came. I knew I shouldn't have come to this hipster nonsense restaurant. Food smelled good tho too bad we never got to eat it and we never will. Staff was so unprofessional."}
{"text":"The wait time is ridiculous! But I was with friends so I behaved.  I think it took 45 min, but once seated, the server came over and one thing she inquired on was food allergies. I mentioned my allergy. A host came over to fuss over my allergy! I was surprised and taken aback because I have never had someone fuss so much about it. I don't even fuss! I just know to not eat that particular food item. That was a bit of a shock to the system.   Eventually our food came and my buttermilk pancakes were so fluffy, filling and so yummy. Sometimes, you want floury goodness to fill your tummy!  The maple syrup comes in cute, tiny science beakers (if I remember my terminology correctly), the organic fair trade coffee has a good taste. I don't do brunch often, but I did enjoy this one!"}
{"text":"somewhere between 4* & 3.5*. because apparently, schools very inconsistent w their food & their service. bleh. we only ended up here because aunties & uncles was closed for some reason DURING brunch time on a SATURDAY !?!?  anyways, when i went to school, on a hot bright sunny saturday noonish, i fell in love w their patio. and their cute school atmosphere . and their cute helpful servers in cute uniforms . and ..... their peanut butter banana smoothie. mmmmm (we only ordered one at first BECAUSE my brunch date said one of the two times he had it before, it was just gross & disgusting. we tested out the first one to see if its good that day, and it was :) YUM) . i love how the menu is divided between savoury & sweet. i LOVE how the bill comes in an envelope.   i had the spiced egg benny. it was amazing compared to cora's, subpar compared to bonjour brioche/lady marmalade. average (pretty big for me esp for a first meal of the day!) portion. before we ordered, i was suggesting between the two of us, we get 2 savoury dishes and 1 sweet to share but good thing we didnt! i was soo full by the end. i dont know why i always get so greedy w brunch. :P"}
{"text":"This place is kind of a rip off. My friend ordered bacon and eggs because of allergies, and they charged her $25 because \"it was made up of the sides menu\" she had to fight with the manager to get him to charge her the same rate as what all the other breakfasts were. My other friend ordered a dish and it came topped with a nice long hair... they didn't really apologize or even comp her tea. She didn't ask but it would have been an appropriate gesture. I will admit, my food was good to very good. My bill was for a tea ($4) and a salad ($17) and pastry ($6). I thought it was over priced and won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is jam packed! You will have to wait at least 30 minutes for  table but I can tell you it's absolutely not worth the wait.  The food takes forever and I am an extremely patient dude. We're talking about like 40 minutes kind of wait here. This wait only makes me hangry and builds up my anticipation. And usually with great expectation...comes great disappointment.  There's really not much to rave about here. The place is busy, loud and slow as molasses. The food is not worthy of any of the aforementioned.  2 stars because I am a nice guy and the menu items sound so epic but in reality they suck. :("}
{"text":"I try not to write a review based on one visit, but this place left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Which is unfortunate because I really wanted to like this place based on the overall vibe I was feeling when I walked in. They had live DJs on the patio playing soulful hip-hop and house. It seemed like it was going to be a great moment.  We sat down and our waitress was over rather quickly and left us some menus (which were three-hole punched and looked like writing paper - nice touch) and she also took our drink orders. Unfortunately we had to wait 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive. Nothing more than some bottled beer and a glass of wine so there really seemed to be no excuse for taking that long... There were a few other waitresses working so even though it seemed busy it should not take that long.  We placed our food order when the drinks arrived that that seemed to take another 30 minutes to arrive. Mind you we could see the food sitting on the counter when it was ready and our waitress grabbed it almost immediately so no fault to her this moment... But wait, the order was wrong. Ordered two different kinds of burgers: one of one kind and three of the other, and she flipped them. We were so hungry at this point we just ate them and she offered us a discount, which ended up being 10%... Not really a lot when your bill is over 100 bucks.  I was half done my beer but ordered another one knowing how long it would take to arrive. Sure enough I had finished my drink before my second one reached me. Our waitress was lovely and polite, just not really on the ball. She might have been new and I am willing to try this place out again and give them a second chance.  But overall the service, average food and final price isn't exactly going to get me to run back to School anytime soon. Grade: C+"}
{"text":"Always a long wait over the weekend - but always worth it. We were a party of 2 so we shared our dishes. We had the chicken and waffle (our sweet servers favourite) and it was a great choice. And our second dish was the sweet French toast dish - which was to die for. The concept and the school theme in everything make the experience worth it too."}
{"text":"I must say, the all over branding of the ``school``  idea is done so well. Everything from the apple on each table, the cushions upholstered with chalkboard writing to the bill coming in a small manila envelope really solidifies the grammar school feel.  Other than those touches of chalk board white, the place is decorated in black. This did take me a bit by surprise. I kinda thought it would be more in the shade of the old school desk like they have as their host station.  I did not get a chance try their brunch which is available seven days a week (weee!!!).   I tried their baked goods and coffee. All of it had this wonderful home baked taste. Moist and flavourful. Highly recommend the pumpkin spiced whoopie pie and giant chocolate chip cookie.  The cheddar chive scone was a nice savory addition to my sweet kick.  The chives made me crazy some mashed potatoes and gravy.  They use Illy coffee which is already a plus in their favour. A good cup of Joe.  I recommend this venue for their baked goods and coffee. I can't give you a full idea on how their brunch or dinner menu ranks but I can say it is promising. If what I have tried so far is any indication of how the rest of the things they make are, I cannot wait!!  PS...They have free wi-fi!!"}
{"text":"I don't see how this place isn't at least 4 stars. This was my wife's and I first time going to a Canadian restaurant and it was very nice, cozy with a really nice atmosphere. The servers were very courteous and attentive. The service was nice and fast no more than 15mins for our food (so that gave us a chance to converse and soak in the atmosphere.... and see the other plates of food so we could see what we were in store for ) I found out about this place on @tastetoronto instagram page and the black and blueberry pancakes  reeled me in. They were as delicious as the pictures I saw! Great flavor and to give it a added touch I ordered a side of brown sugar cured bacon. That's a great combo! I should've asked them to break the bacon up and put it on top of my pancakes. My wife had the chicken and waffles which were really tasty as well. Being from the U.S. I like my chicken with a little more seasoning to give it that flavor but I guess that's how Canadians like their chicken.    I recommend checking this place out especially if you're in town from the States, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Just had brunch In the courtyard.  Unique interior, pretty courtyard and great service.  We got there at 1030 on a Sunday so no wait but started to get packed at 12 when we were leaving.   Coffee and water came very promptly but food took a while. We had the cheesy French toast with bacon and chorizo omelette.  French toast was ok but tasted like cheese on bread, prefer actual French toast.  Chorizo omelette was delicious with fluffy eggs and a yummy sour cream dip. Good interior and option to check out brunch with a twist instead of the usual bacon and eggs.  SUMMARY:unique restaurant interior/concept, great service, different twist on traditional brunch."}
{"text":"I love going to School for brunch on weekend. You will have to wait a bit but what good brunch restaurant doesnt have a long line. My girlfriend always has a mimosa with lunch. I'm not a big fan of sweet drinks but she said it's always good. My fav is  the steak and egg. can't go wrong with steak and egg. And the decor is fun and refreshing, you dont feel so stuffy in other brunch places."}
{"text":"Go here for Breakfast. They open early! Get the Cinnamon-Vanilla French Toast. Thank me later.   YUM! I finally went here for breakfast this week, and I'm sooo glad that they open early! This french toast was absolutely delectable. It was thick. It was perfectly cooked. It was melt in your mouth good. And it was festooned with strawberries and whipped cream. Oh man. YUM!  Service was great too, our server even seemed to be fully awake and not hungover at all - if you've been out to breakfast lots of other places in TO, you know what I mean. :)  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to school several times but not in the last year or so. I was so disappointed when I went recently. Less menu options and all of them were on the overly sweet side. I won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Every one remembers that feeling when the school bell was about to ring,  when you get to School early enough, there's a cute bell that's rung to start off the day. I would suggest getting there early on weekends, there can be a line.   If it's a nice day, I would suggest the patio - hella cute! I've been here twice and both times the food and service were good. You can't come here without ordering the Black n Blue Flapjacks - Hella insta worthy and pretty damn delicious! Stacked Pancakes topped with Blueberry sauce, brown sugar butter and maple syrup! If you still have a sweet tooth after that, then try the Chocolate Croissant French Toast - really good but very sweet, w/ Caramelized Bananas, Toasted Coconut, Warm Nutella, Vanilla Whip + Fresh Mint.   I think the next thing I would try is the Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast, sounds amazing.   Keep Eating,   Angela"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch when visiting and really enjoyed it. There was about an hour wait which is kind of standard for brunch on the weekends so it didn't deter us at all. Once we were seated we were able to see the cute decor of this small yet elaborately designed restaurant. The whole school theme is a great touch.  I had the stuffed french toast with cream cheese filling topped with strawberries and the sugared bacon. The bacon was sooo good - once my friends tried it they wanted a side as well.  My friend had the poutine and I had a bit of that - that was really good as well. The service as well was great.  I definitely advice checking this place out if you're in the area and considering it for brunch!"}
{"text":"Yes it's true, you'll wait for your table at this hot-spot brunch resto in LV. We arrived at 11:30 on a Sunday and waited an hour (but we were a party of 7, so smaller tables may get seated quicker). But they put a few 'waiting' chairs outside and there are also a bunch of benches around...on a beautiful day we didn't mind too much. We bought various coffee drinks (lattes, cappucinos, etc) from the bar and brought them outside while we passed the time...all were top-notch.  60 minutes later we scored a great table on the back patio.  The brunch menu is drool-worthy...so many creative choices. School doesn't fuck around; some of the sweet creations are over-the-top indulgent, such as the smore waffles covered with chocolate, marshmellow and graham cracker bits. The savoury list is no less indulgent, with buttermilk fried chicken or french toast covered in melted cheese....but healthy folks have ample choice as well, such as egg-white/goat cheese/asparagus fritata or egg atop endive salad, etc.  All 7 in our party thoroughly enjoyed the brunch.  For me, the wild blueberry pancakes were ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING and probably some of the best bb pancakes I've ever had. Much better than the famous ones at Clinton Street Baking Co in NYC. But the sugar-cured bacon (\"best bacon in the city\" says the menu) was ridiculously disappointing. I asked for it well done and it arrived fatty, chewy and greasy as all get-out. Like, off-the-charts greasy. I recommend getting your panackes with sausages, which were better. Unfortunately, the white sangria was also disappointing but the juice du jour was lovely.  Overall the food was an A+ and I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Friday afternoon and got seated right away. Location was easy to find with a parking lot right across.   Restaurant had a rustic feel with an open kitchen concept. So you can see cooks at work.   We ordered the bacon cheddar burger, grown up grilled cheese and the black and blue pancakes to share. We also had a flask (1L) mojito special.   Bacon cheddar burger was VERY tasty with lots of flavours going on. The bacon was thick and cooked properly, not too crispy and not too chewy. The flavour of the bacon didn't overpower the rest of the burger either. There was also melted cheese, and pickles as well. The burger was juicy, and cooked just right, with the middle still pink (some may not like this). It was messy to eat but filled me up. I had the daily soup as the side which was the beef stew and it had tons of ingredients and big chunks of beef. It tasted homemade and warmed the soul. Overall the burger was oily but tasty. 3.5/5  My girlfriend ordered the grown up grilled cheese which is really just a grilled cheese with mushrooms, arugula and carmelized onions. It was okay, nothing special and not a must try. It was on the dry side and didn't have much flavour. The mushrooms overpowered everything. She got a salad as her side but she did not enjoy it as the dressing was also too oily. 3/5  Black and blue pancakes - they were the star of the meal. Blueberry topping was SOOOO good. Perfect amount of sweetness and blueberry taste. The pancakes themselves were fluffy and full of flavour. When we cut them open they were steaming. My girlfriend also loved the brown sugar butter. These are VERY good, comparable to a certain temple's pancakes. GET THIS to share!!! 4/5  The snowball mojito was served in a glass beaker but the mint and like were not muddled in properly so you couldn't really taste it. They also came with small beaker glasses with cinnamon sticks in them, we both removed them because it was very weird tasting and overpowering in the mojito. Presentation was good, taste was subpar. 2/5   Overall this brunch place was an interesting visit and I would say it was worth it for the pancakes. We didd not have to wait, so I guess that added to it. May eventually try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the chicken and waffles for brunch. Found this to be better then the Drake. Friendly service - make sure to get there early. Parking is easy to find across the street as well.   4/5*"}
{"text":"One of my favourite, go-to brunch places! I've been countless  There's usually a long line on Saturdays, so I opt to go Sunday's, which still has a like but not as insane.   My absolute favourite from them is the cheddar chive biscuit with maple butter, nothing is better.   The portion size is very generous and they do tend to change up their menu semi-frequently.  You can't really go wrong with anything on their menu, although their chicken waffle is slightly on the drier side.  Overall, love! Solid choice if you want Canadian comfort food!"}
{"text":"I've been to School Bakery and Cafe twice now for brunch.  The first time I tried the waffle which was decent as far as waffles go but it came luke warm.  The second time I went back,  I tried the yogurt + granola parfait which was gross.  There was barely any granola and the chopped fruit was too liquidy which made the yogurt liquidy.   The people I went with ordered different egg dishes and both reviews were mediocre.  Very heavy and greasy food.   Their tea is good though.  Nicely presented and it is loose leaf which I am always a fan of.  The interior decor is also funky so the ambience of a mediocre brunch is pleasant.    I would not rush back to School for brunch especially since you have to get there before 10:30am if you want to get a seat and not wait in line."}
{"text":"Came here for a Saturday morning breakfast and had a tasty meal. When my friend called dibs for the fried apple waffles, I was annoyed. Decided to go with the French Toast (a little pricey at $15). And boy was I happy to have gotten it instead.  Two large pieces of French toast, topped with grapefruit slices. On the side was some jam, spread across the plate, and a ball of rich maple butter. The key to this French toast was the texture. Coated with Rice Krispies, the outside was crispy and crunchy, as advertised. The inside was soft and chewy - a delicious juxtaposition of textures that's as satisfying for the teeth as it is for the tongue. Absolutely excellent French toast. Couldn't finish but I wish I could've eaten more. Not so much a sweets fan and get sick easily. But for how sweet this was, it was delicious.  3.5 stars. The service wasn't too friendly and the food took a while to get to us (over 20 mins) - the place was packed though. At any rate, worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time visiting, and really wanted to love this place....nope, didn't happen. Great food, but crap service."}
{"text":"this place was super cool!  i ended up here after the first breakfast place i went to was closed.  the atmosphere is super nice and of course \"school\" themed.  loved the prickly pear juice which came in a cute little beaker cup.    i was torn on what to get but i ended up with the black and blue waffles... they were delicious!!! the berries were super fresh and even tho they didnt need syrup, it was soo good! i couldnt not eat some of it!  server was super nice and helped me choose when i couldnt."}
{"text":"Was looking for a brunch place in Liberty Village and thought we'd try out School, not only because Julia's grade 5 graduation is today :-)  The menu looked great and I'll definitely be back some day after 1130 to try some more things that weren't available early AM..  Ashleigh tried the Cinnamon-Vanilla French Toast, which had just the right amount of strawberries topping it off.  Julia had the Black&Blue Berry pancake stack, which had so many berries it looked like one of those muffins with the fruit all exploding out the centre when she cut through it.  I had the Super Cheesy French Toast and especially liked that the bacon was actually crispy without having to expressly ask for it as such and the melted cheese all over it was amazing.  The only thing I could recommend would be that the dressing on my side greens would have been perfect with either a tangy-er dressing or maybe more of it..  The decor was really cool with all the clocks set to 330, shiny red apples for centrepieces, chalkboard for daily specials, bill comes in a small report-card-like envelope, and even the schoolgirl uniform on our waitress looked great.  I'll definitely roll by again -- 'Night School' anyone? ;-)"}
{"text":"Went to a restaurant for brunch today for my daughters birthday- it's called School and it's in Liberty Village Don't go there! Place is nice enough but they have certainly drank their own koolaid. Imagine this- I asked for an order of their pancakes but please put all the berry topping on the side instead of all over the pancakes- Server says sure- that will be an extra $3.00 Why I asked Because it's a modification and we are so busy we can't be doing modifications Not sure how $3.00 changes either the busy part or the modification So she says they have to put it in a separate dish and they give more so there's an extra charge Put it on the same plate but just not on top of the pancakes No we can't do that Then I'll have plain pancakes - (isn't that a modification btw) So asked to speak to manager He says it's an inventory control issue- are you kidding me??? Will never go back $85 bill btw Here the customer clearly is not on charge So this is an example of penny wise and pound foolish  #school#dontgo"}
{"text":"The wait is long! Try to come early, but I will say the wait is worth it! this place has the classic shows playing, current hot music, food is made in an area where people can watch you, proper sanitary habits and great customer service....last but not least...the food is amazing!!!! I had the apple crumb pancakes and it was delicious! I do my best to find the hidden gems of everywhere I travel to and I must say this is one of them! A great brunch spot whether you are by yourself, in a group of people or just one on one with someone!"}
{"text":"We (a group of 4 people) came here on Canada Day for brunch (It is good that they are open!). School restaurant is located at the liberty village. As the name suggests, decoration is school style and the container for drinks is actually the beaker that students use in chemistry class! Service was ok. The waiters / waitresses were ready to help. However, food came super slow, which took half an hour and we started eating the cherries we bought from farmers' market... 1. Black and blueberry pancake was filling but too sweet.  2. Fried chicken with waffle was a lot, but it did not taste as good as other restaurants.  3. The safe bet was indeed safe...and it came with a warm cheddar chive biscuit. It is still warm! But the one in second cup (right, the coffee chain) tastes better... 4. We also ordered the millennial toast. It looks nice but I personally didn't try.   Overall, I like the short waiting time to get a table, decoration and the time they gave us to catch up with our friends... However, there is room for improvement for food service and quality."}
{"text":"Everything about this place was fabulous, except for the 90 to 120 minute wait. There are no reservations or call-ahead seating. I guess I wouldn't bother if I were them either since people are obviously willing to wait. You can leave while you're waiting and you'll get a text when your table is ready, but you only have 5 minutes to return and claim your table.   I had the cheesecake French toast and a mimosa and it was absolutely to die for. It would be better if I didn't want to go back because I don't like waiting, but alas... My husband had a skillet and fresh squeezed OJ, which he liked, but it wasn't nearly as good as the French toast.   The school theme of the restaurant was fun. The decor matches, they serve the drinks in beakers, they are playing Saved by the Bell on tv, and the music had an 80s and 90s vibe. It was a fun throwback to my childhood. Also, they have an open air section and small patio. Second patio not yet open.  Additionally, a bit pricey for brunch and no substitutions allowed on the menu."}
{"text":"Arrived for Saturday Brunch. Music was at a very loud and uncomfortable level. The place was full so we sat at the bar. I had to fight for space with a waiter who was using the spot beside me to fill little cups with Maple Syrup.   The Pancakes were pretty blah. They were dense and very dry. Both the regular buttermilk and their \"Black and Blue\" pancakes were NOT good.  We also got a side of Breakfast sausages and they weren't very good. More of a dinner sausage than a Breakfast sausage.    ...and it was pretty pricey for such lackluster food. We were quite disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't get what the raving is all about this restaurant - and the always-lineups during popular times - the food is average.  Yes the 'School' paradigm is interesting, including the 'report' you get as a bill, plus some of the dishes try to be 'inventive' but for the price, one could do better in Toronto.  I suspect it is all the hipster-wannabes from Liberty Village who are jamming this place and raising its status.  I had brunch here (no wait! I never wait!) with a friend - had the chicken (blah, blah, something hipstery) - it was good, the chicken was moist and tasty, but was it worth $22? - probably not.  My friend had some fancy-named french toast - again, good, but not worth $17.  The service was good, though the attitude was there.  If you want really amazing food and farm-fresh local ingredients - go to Canoe, the prices are not much higher.  In liberty village both Caffino and Midred's serve better food for cheaper.  If you want to see lots of wannabe hipsters gushing over an average food (after waiting an hour to get in) - please go here."}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday at noon and managed to get a seat for two right after we walked in. The service was good, our cups always had water and they graciously let us know all the daily specials.  I ordered the cheesy french toast which was absolutely delicious. The bread they used was especially thick and soft and it was covered with a gratuitous amount of cheddar. Tasted delicious with the maple syrup.  I would come back again to maybe try the Chicken and Waffles next time as it looked quite good."}
{"text":"So far, it's my fave place for brunch in Liberty Village and there's enough stuff on the menu that sounds appealing that I'll come back and try them. The two of us had cheesy french toast w/ double smoked bacon, and the four cheese souffle omelet. The french toast was smothered in fried cheese and topped w/ flavorful chopped up bacon. The omelet was indeed cheesy although I couldn't tell you what 4 cheeses they use.   The wait for brunch was about 25 mins when we rolled up at 2:30 and service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday at around 11. They gave us an estimated wait time of an hour so we went back to the condo (an 8 minute walk). They texted us when the table was ready and told us we had 5 minutes to bring the whole group back or we would lose our spot. I find the 5 minute time rule a little extensive.  In the summer, waiting an hour in nice weather isn't so bad but in the winter.... where would you even wait? There entry way fits about 6 people standing... there are no coffee shops or seating area outside. They should at least do 10-15 minute return rule.  The food was good. After having been to Mildred's temple kitchen, the pancakes at school were quite heavy and filling.  I also ordered the grilled cheese French toast. It was very a very heavy meal. Smothered in cheese. A little too much cheese. The flavour was good.  The prices for their dishes was a little pricey. In my opinion they should have smaller portions and lower their prices. Many of us couldn't finish our meals."}
{"text":"This place is always packed for brunch! There's deff a reason for it ! I love their waffles and the decor is super cute! The wait is a bit long but worth it!"}
{"text":"It's been 60 mins since we ordered our food. We've been advised their head chefs walked out a couple of days ago and their general managers are now cooking in the kitchen. I get it, shit happens and you gotta make do. But they couldn't even get us an order of fries to nibble on while waiting for the food because even that would \"take a while as well\". This was disappointing for a first experience.  Update: we got the food another 20 mins later and was told it's on the house. Thanks, but that still doesn't make up for the lack of honesty with the whole situation.  Now the food, pancakes were delish. Chicken was tender, however the grilled cheese was overly greasy and the bread was too hard."}
{"text":"Three stars for food. Four stars for the casual, trendy atmosphere perfect for weekend brunch.  We visited on a Saturday morning at 9:00 AM and were seated right away (by the time we left at around 10:00 AM, the place was full). Note that parking in the lot attached to the restaurant is free on weekends (we couldn't understand why people were paying for street parking?). Decor was cute, with the quirky school theme represented pretty much in every facet of the restaurant, from old Saved by the Bell reruns, to the beakers they served drinks in.  We ordered the: a) Krispy Krunchy French Toast ($16.00), b) Black N' Blue Flapjacks stacked high with black and blueberry sauce ($16.00), and c) a glass (or small beaker, I should say) of apple cider ($6). To be honest, we weren't too impressed with the food. The french toast was a bit bland, and overtly sweet - while the texture of the Rice Krispies was interesting, the bread was a bit tough to chew, and overall, kind of dull. The flapjacks were definitely eye-catching, but the pancakes weren't as fluffy as I was expecting, and were a little too sweet for my liking. It was all sweetness, with no real body. For the price, I was expecting a lot more in taste and flavour - it ain't all about the looks, you know?  The atmosphere partly made up for our disappointment over the food - it's a charming space, and the decor exhibited wonderful attention to detail.  For two people, with tax and tip, our total was $48.53."}
{"text":"Love the service and food, we had the blueberry pancakes and chicken and waffles, only downside to this breakfast/brunch place is that it's usually really packed. I love the ambience of the place!"}
{"text":"Easily the best spot for brunch in the city. Huge portions and the food is incredible. I've gotten the chicken and waffles almost every time and i have never been let down. it's a popular spot so the wait times can be long but it's worth every minute."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a cool, trendy vibe following a school theme. We were seated right away during lunch time and were served food in good time.   I order the chicken and waffles with a maple latte. The maple latte was good but a little too sweet for my tastes. Chicken waffle was pretty good but I would have liked a lighter, less dense waffle. The chicken was cooked well at the right crispiness. Their hot syrup sauce had a mild kick to it which was interesting.   The downside to the food was that I found several pieces of hair or some sort of fiber deep fried into my batter. I took pictures of a few pieces I could find but I'm pretty sure there were more that I ate because towards the end of the meal, I just keep finding new pieces of fiber. Not appealing at all. They definitely weren't chicken hair or anything that you would find in a dish. That's why I'm giving this place a two star instead of three. The food was otherwise acceptable in taste."}
{"text":"We arrived by 10:15 on a Saturday which was awesome because it seems we just beat the brunch crowd by a little. (They serve alcohol at 11am so we noticed the line start to grow by 10:45).   We got a beautiful seat in a booth by the window. The light and atmosphere is great. The food is excellent  My ONLY complaint is that they do NOT let you ask for sour cream on the side of a plate. I dislike sour cream so much and can not understand why a restaurant would not allow you to ask for your dish without it. I understand no substitutions but I will never understand why a restaurant won't let you ask them to omit something they simply plop on the top of the dish at the end before they serve you. (yes, I would understand if it was baked inside or pre made).  The best part is I went to order the dish and I ask without sour cream and the waitress says,   me \"What is your best dish\"  waitress \"the huevos rancheros\"  me- \"I'll have that without sour cream\"  waitress- \"But our sour cream is really good\"  me- \"That's okay, I really don't like sour cream\"  waitress- \"but It has jalepeanos in it\"  Me \"thats okay, I'll just have it without\"  waitress \"they really don't like when you do that\"  me \"really, is it baked in?\"  waitress \"no, but they don't like when you do that\"  me \"okay, I'll have the pancakes\"   Everything we tasted was delicious. (cheddar and chive biscuit, pancakes, Huevos rancheros (I tasted my sister in laws who ordered this WITH sour cream, but I was able to pick some from the side).   Anyway, let me take the sour cream off my order and this place would get a 5. Or at least just tell me from the start that the kitchen doesn't allow it and don't give me the run around."}
{"text":"Cool brunch location. Long wait on a Sunday, about an hour long but definitely worth it! The restaurant has a laid back vibe, it's not super fancy looking like Mildred's but the food is similar. The chandeliers are very artistic! My pecan pancakes were delicious! Thick and soft, with pecan chunks, maple syrup, mascarpone cheese and whipped cream. There were 4 pancakes, and I could eat only 2. These weren't fluffy like Mildred's but scrumptious, in their own way.  The chicken and waffle is also a popular thing to order, however I wasn't a fan of the maple butter or the waffle as it was slightly bland. Great experience overall, will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Some of the best french toast I have had. My girl loved her eggs benni. Devin was attentive and funny. Overall great experience"}
{"text":"We went for brunch on a Saturday, I was delighted with the fun atmosphere and the variety of creative brunch items. It was a tad pricey but worth the splurge. The cheesy french toast was delish, although I wish I tasted more \"french toast\" than cheese. It tasted like delicious cheesy bread."}
{"text":"School bakery does fairly well on quality food, but is overpriced for what you get. Furthermore, the service left a bit to be desired.   Before we even got our food, we sat on the patio where we were absolutely assaulted by wasps. I know that the place can't be expected to control the wasps, but when given the option to sit outside or inside, they should have told us about the wasp situation outside. I noticed that they didn't tell anyone else about this either. We asked to be moved inside, but the manager came out to inform us that there wasn't any space inside, and that since we had already ordered, we had to stay outside. We noticed that there were tables being cleared inside, and so this was more about them not wanting to switch servers, and less about there being space inside. Also, her tone and explanation was not one that should be used when explaining something to your customer.   We perused the menu, hoping for a breakfast sandwich, or any sort of normal breakfast, but the menu was comprised solely of over-the-top dishes, replete with adjectives such as \"buttermilk fried\" or \"local\", etc. We asked if we could just get some bacon and eggs, but they informed us that they didn't serve plain eggs on the weekends. I guess this is because you can't add as many fancy adjectives to a plain egg, limiting your ability to add a substantial mark-up on your menu items.   We had chive biscuits, a side of sausages and a banana chocolate muffin. The biscuits and muffin were quite tasty, but the turkey sausages looked undercooked. The meat was pink, and there was a dodgy pool of juice at the bottom that looked like juice that comes from meat that hasn't been cooked fully. We informed our waiter about this, and again the manager comes out and tells us that it is in fact fully cooked, and that it just has a different colour. I do quite a bit of cooking myself, and that sausage was questionable. I was pretty shocked that she would have rather risked us eating raw turkey meat than get the cook to put it back on the fryer for a few more seconds, or to just give us a new one. This is unacceptable customer service.   Finally, after we finished eating, the table next to us noticed that their was condensation in their water glasses, and they asked for new ones. The waiter told them that because they were so busy, the dishwasher doesn't dry them as well, or it was because of the humidity outside. He didn't get them new glasses. By this point, that had been 3 separate occasions where the staff of this restaurant denied a request from their customers (no seating inside to escape the wasp, no taking back turkey sausage that wasn't fully cooked, and no replacing a wet water glass). This is just simply not how to treat your customers.   With breakfast dishes in the $15-20 range, and poor service, I don't think I'll be eating here again anytime soon. The baked goods here are quite good, but I wouldn't recommend dining in."}
{"text":"This place is going downhill.   Went here the other weekend and they had their patio area and inside area door (large garage doors) wide open. The temperature was 12 degrees.   When we asked the server to close the doors we got some excuse about this being a transitional season..or as we interpreted they can seat alot more people if they use their indoor and outdoor seating.   Anyways the food was also, so so. Cheesy french toast was almost instantly cold because of the weather and not at all gooey as it usually is."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I was a little apprehensive about coming here, but I was not disappointed.   I ordered the cheesy bacon french toast and my friend got the grilled cheese sandwich. The french taost bread was delicious, with crispy bacon on top and sooooooo much gooey cheese melted on top (and covering every inch of it). The maple syrup comes on the side, which is a nice touch (as I hate when my syrup touches my food). It came with a side warm arugula salad, which was delicious as well.  My friend said the grilled cheese was delicious as well!   I will definitely be coming back to try the pancakes and the chicken and waffles!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch, had the chocolate croissant french toast.... OMG! Just amaze-Balls!  Wife took the crunchy french toast... just ridiculous!! Price is great, location is great, staff was perfect!"}
{"text":"Customer service skills are lacking. The kitchen refuses to make simple customizations, as stated on their menu. Unfriendly, but fair enough; however when you ask for something cooked less or without specific ingredients (read: less work) and the server gives you attitude and tries to school you (see what I did there?), it's a turn off.   Infrequent visits and no refills on water. Her excuse? It was \"busy.\" Were there people? Yes. Were there many empty tables in all sections of the restaurant? Yes.  The salads are glorified, unimaginative, overpriced piles of kale. There were maybe 2 tablespoons of quinoa. This was dinner. Perhaps they're only good for brunch.   We took people from out of town here. It was embarrassing. And for the record, we kept it civil."}
{"text":"The black n blue flapjack was very good; the jam, syrup, whipped cream and butter combines for multiple layers of flavour. Also had the cheesy French toast and the friend chicken burger, both were good, but not nearly as amazing as the pancakes."}
{"text":"Went there last Sunday and it was a beautiful day so we sat on the patio. Everything that you look for in a breakfast/brunch spot is at School. The food was outstanding, service impeccable, and atmosphere was just great. I would go back in a heartbeat, especially because I got the hashbrown poutine but I just HAVE to try the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Really yummy food. You can't go wrong here no matter what you order. I recommend coming with the anticipation of a wait, but you can remedy that by putting down your phone number and starting with a coffee elsewhere. It's in a nice suburb so good for a short walk.   The super cheesy French toast is pretty damn good. I don't want to know how many calories are in it lol the chef told me that was his favorite dish, so I guess I recommend starting with that one and moving your way through the brunch list on subsequent visits as you most definitely will return!"}
{"text":"The food is nothing out of the ordinary. It's good but maybe a little overpriced. They charge extra for every single thing (like hot sauce) which is redundant given the food is already priced so high. When we got our meal it did not taste fresh, some of it was a bit cold even. And the service was not great either. It wasn't a terrible experience but there are many great spots in the city so I would not go back here."}
{"text":"Eh service and food is just good, not that great in my opinion. Presentation is very good though"}
{"text":"This place is a decent spot for brunch. First thing you'll notice is the nostalgic feeling of second period when you enter. Chalkboards, clocks, and rulers are plastered everywhere to remind you of your favorite class and that Walkman with the duct tape to harvest your batteries. I would recommend you get there early as there is no reservation and our wait ended up being over an hour long.   I ordered the tower of cinnamon sugar pecan pancakes. While the pancakes were certainly worth an upload to my Instagram story, they could have been a bit more fluffy. There were times I felt I was cutting more into the pancakes than I should have. The accompanying maple syrup was lackluster as well as it was not very sweet.  I know, was there anything good about the place? Well, the highlight of that cloud-filled afternoon was the x factor: the sugar cured bacon. Let me tell you, this was  easily the best piece of bacon I have ever had in my life. No, seriously. It is without a doubt worth the extra credit."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but just everything that could have been bad about my experience was:  - I was in a group of 3 and we lined up for around 20 mins, which wouldn't have mattered if anything else was good...  - I ordered blue and blackberry pancakes and they were too sweet, but disregarding that, it wasn't very good overall.  - My friend ordered bacon with her omelette, and when it came there was none to be seen. She asked our waitress if there was some inside, waitress told her to cut it open and check and that she would be back. It took 15 mins for her to finally come back, and by that time I and the 3rd person had basically finished eating already and the omelette was cold.  They did give her an entirely new omelette but they didn't offer to comp it or give her free dessert to apologize for what happened.  Based on this experience, there is no reason for me to come back here: long wait + not-so-great food + terrible service."}
{"text":"Just came back from brunch here. My friend and I arrived at noon, probably a bad idea in terms of planning... Brunch in the city requires some strategy and it's usually best to try for either early (10-11am) or late (after 1). So we did end up waiting for about 30 mins., but luckily we were brought mini apple pie muffins and shot glasses of mango lassis to tide us over while we waited. Waiting in line also gave us lots of time to admire the baked goods at the front -- blueberry white chocolate scones looked amazing, and I was curious about the \"tomato soup\" cupcake (?) but wasn't bold enough to try it this time. They were bringing fresh brownies and cookies from the oven, everything looked so good...   I ended up having the chorizo/goat cheese omelette ($13), which was filling and delicious. It came with a side of greens. I also had the maple latte which was nice. They do have lots of interesting drink options, hot and cold, alcoholic and non. Maybe next time I'll try the \"jungle fruit smoothie\".   Nice place with cute details in keeping with the school theme (e.g. menus on clipboards, drinks from glass beakers). Service was decent. Great place for a relaxed weekend brunch. Be sure to get some baked goods to bring home after!   *Free parking after 5pm or all-day on weekends."}
{"text":"Interesting menu options, they do not allow modifications. I've been a few times never disappointed but never blown away for the price. Cute place to go if you're hungover on a Saturday AM with friends"}
{"text":"Potentially a new fave.  A+ on aesthetic.  Every aspect of design matched their \"school\" theme. From menus printed on loose leaf-esque paper, to a wall of clocks all pointing to 3 o'clock, I could appreciate all of it.   Went with a friend this morning and it wasn't busy when we first got there, around 9:45am, but an hour later it was pretty packed.  Started with coffee - nothing special about it, other than cream being served in a beaker.   We got the black and blue flapjacks and the chicken and waffles and split them because we couldn't decide on having a sweet or savoury breakfast - all of their options looked great. Both orders of were really good and portion size was worth paying for. The chicken may have been a little on the salty/over seasoned side, but paired with the fluffy waffles and coleslaw worked well together. The flapjacks were served with a really yummy blueberry and blackberry compote and the cutest little beaker of syrup. The flapjacks alone were also nice and fluffy - but don't let the \"lightness\" fool you we left stuffed."}
{"text":"Oh boy this place is so good! Tried the cheesy French toast and was so yum! Located in Liberty village and it super cute inside! It's always packed on weekends but it's defiantly worth the wait. Great coffee too! Service was great."}
{"text":"I really like how they set it up into a school like theme. One of the rooms was a cafeteria and the other was a library. You get your drinks in beakers and each table as an apple! How cute. My favourite part was getting the bill (i know right?) obviously not the bill itself but rather the fact that it came in a school style report card. I havent had a report card given to me since highschool lol. so it does bring back heaps of memories and it was very cute. As for food, we had the blueberry flapjack pancakes which were yummy, but not as yummy as Mildreds i found. The chicken and waffles were interesting. This was my first time having those two together and it actually goes well. Next up we have the burger. Not the best choice but was craving for a burger!"}
{"text":"Now the food has been delicious both times I have been.  The waffles were amazing the first time.  Their bacon served on the side is so large of a portion that I shares with my table.  The breakfast poutine is the best to cure any and everything.   The only down side s the wait....with no chance to reserve in advance it's frustrating if you are hungry but totally worth the waitm"}
{"text":"I have driven past this place a million times especially when shooting in the area not to mention I had heard some pretty good reviews about this place so when I had the opportunity to pop in to grab a quick coffee I thought why not? I didn't have time to eat, I was early for a shoot and while the photographer set up I decided to grab us some drinks nearby. Liberty village is a little bit limited in choices and unless I wanted to walk a few blocks this was my best option.  First of all I have to say that the place seemed EXTREMELY small, the patio was literally all the seating they had and this day was particularly hot and humid so even sitting inside you could barely breathe. The setup seemed odd as the patio and indoor fused literally as one making it impossible to control the temp indoors I would assume and so I sweat like a pig waiting for them to hand me a bottle of water. The decor itself I found dark and dreary, the cluttered counters and makeshift coffee station where you get to make your own coffee and tip them for it was less then desireable to say the least.  The outfits the servers were wearing were also questionable for the area they are located; Liberty Village is supposed to come off as upscale and many establishments have maintained a pride in doing this but having the servers dress in school girl type outfits gave the place a \"hooters\" or \"jack astors\" feel. And when your paying the kind of money your paying there I find it a wee bit out of place and almost tasteless, dragging the perception of the place down even further in my eyes.  A big thing for me is parking and they do not have ANY.... just paid parking in a super crammed lot where they have parking vultures circling non stop. But my biggest complaint about this place would have to be the service, I found all the staff I encountered in that short period of time snobby, unattentive and generally unfriendly which really put the finishing touch on the place for me. I wanted to rate it 3 stars as I have not tried the menu and that may have a positive influence on my interpretation of this place BUT with all the negative things I've already mentioned I highly doubt the menu will be worth the trip back."}
{"text":"BEST Brunch Place I've had so far! The menu items are tastier than Mildred's Temple Kitchen.   Wait Time & Service -  Although the wait times were long (40 minutes for two when we went on 11:30 am on Sunday in the summer) they took down our number and texted us when the table was ready.   We sat down and the server was very attentative. I had mentioned my lactose intolerance, then the manager came over to clarify what the allergy was (e.g. anaphylactic versus GI intolerance) and discussed the potential for cross contamination. I was so impressed that they were concerned about the wellbeing of their customers.  Food took long but was well worth the wait. We ordered Black 'n' Blue Flapjacks Stached High (five pancakes!!) with Black and Blueberry Sauce and Brown Sugar Butter. The maple syrup came in a shot glass, and the brown sugar butter was delicious and unique twist.     Ambience -  They really played to the school theme which I loved! Menus on lined paper, school clocks that I remember from my childhood set to \"3:30 pm\" (when school is out!) and fun menu items (\"Teacher's Pet\").   I'd really recommend coming to Liberty Village just for School Restaurant. A bit of a wait, but come prepared by eating something small before you go for the wait!"}
{"text":"Here's the deal....It is Friday and I am stuck at my desk and hungry, so I decided to order delivery from The School Bakery and Cafe.  Ordered a Peppered Cheeseburger and a Large SBC Rosemary Parmigiano Fries, a large soup of the day, a Jerk Chicken Salad and a Large coffee.....Total cost: $43.28 tax included plus a $7 tip....so $50.28 total.  This was for me and my partner and the food sounded good so I did not mind paying the price.  Then once the delivery girl left (she was sweet) we sat down to eat........then enters disappointment:(  They brought the soup, which was adequate.  The fries were decent.  The Illy coffee was so bad I threw it out.....and I love Illy coffee.  Then comes the salad....not Jerk Chicken like I ordered and it even says it on the receipt!  Instead i get a tuna salad which is too heavy and semi disgusting tasting....ate some and threw it out:(  And my partner's Peppered Cheeseburger.......well that did not arrive either.  Instead he received a plain burger....nothing peppered about it and no cheese:( I understand that this is a new part of the restaurant....but give me break.  How hard is it to check the food that goes in the bag?  Qaulity control definitely lacking in this new venture.  I would have called back up to have it taken back and new food delivered, but we said, well they are new and we are hungry....big mistake. This place is now on my permanently banned list.  So sad."}
{"text":"Pretty good brunch. Line-up/wait for a table can sometimes get a bit ridiculous. Wish they took reservations!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time and it was an amazing experience.   Service is very hospitable and food's presentation was great.   Highly recommend the pan-fried hash browns with jalapeno sour cream!   I got the Belgian waffles and my friend tried their Mexican skillet. Would definitely recommend their skillet options!   Only downfall is they have limited seating so their wait times can get super inconvenient"}
{"text":"Went to school for the second time within a year and have to say it kept to it's great standard. Went for brunch during the week and was lucky enough to get an order of the sausages (usually just a weekend item), and had them alongside the chicken and waffles. Chicken was perfectly fried and the waffles were sooo light and fluffy, my only issue was wanting more syrup! So ask for more when you order.   We also tried the sweet and savoury - cheesy French toast. Although an insane amount of cheese came with this dish, it was so filling and tasty, the French toast itself was thick cut and had a great flavour.   Had the freshly squeezed juice of the day and the server was so nice and friendly. Great experience through and through - weekend or weekday!"}
{"text":"I had the nutella waffles and a side of sour cream hash browns.  The hash browns were pretty good, but then again I haven't eaten any that has met my standards yet.  If you do order the nutella waffles, be sure to have lots of water at hand as this super sweet dish will make you thirsty as hell.  It's amazing for what it is, but you'll be super thirsty from all the sugar.  It did taste awesome and the presentation was amazing.  Only gripe is that the wait and serving time did take a while."}
{"text":"Love this place for the decor and school house theme throughout the entire place (even down to the table candles in science beakers). We had the mexican fried chicken and fish & chips, good and reasonably priced. Staff was friendly and helpful. On a early Thursday evening (7pm) it was not too crowded.  This place made our first trip to Toronto a pleasant one."}
{"text":"I enjoy the location more than the food and service here but I've been a number of times for brunch and always leave satisfied if not over the moon.  As a vegetarian there are few dishes for me to choose from without being one of those people asking to change everything in a dish. That said, the four cheese omelt souffle and parmesan asparagus omelet are my faves. I love brunch - typical brunch and fancy brunch and this place offers it for meat eaters for sure. The salad greens are a nice touch and the homefries are pretty good too. The coffee is strong which I like but the flavour isn't my favourite - the cup is huge though!  There's almost always a line up but it moves quickly and they smartly place freshly baked goods - muffins, cookies, scones on a bar right at eye level to get you salivating.   The staff is cutely dressed in school girl/guy uniforms with short skirts and knee socks to add to the ambience. I like the dark wood and black decor in a beautiful old brick building that I remember as the warehouse grill from some years back. Staff is friendly, the vibe is cool, I like that about it - young, attractive crowd, kid friendly. Nice brunch spot."}
{"text":"To be completely honest I was dragged here on a Sunday morning to stand in the longest lineup of all time (in February might I add). It smelled amazing inside but the food was not worth the hour and a half wait. It's honestly people just hyping it up because of the decor inside. I had the chicken and waffles because it looked like everyone was eating it, but to be honest it wasn't completely satisfying or good. It was something about the chicken that tasted off. I also got a side of the potato hash and it was okay at first but after a few bites it started to taste gross and I got tired of it. I wasn't that impressed and the look was cute but it doesn't make up for the foods taste, I will probably never come back here. Save yourself the hours of waiting and go to another breakfast joint that will seat you right away and actually satisfy you."}
{"text":"Do you love brunch? Do you love being blown away by brunch? School is the place for you! I've never had such a well rounded brunch anywhere else. Any item you get is a phenomenal take on brunch classics. My personal favorite is the Cheesy French Toast and the Hashbrowns. Fresh made juices and perfect coffee every time? What more can you ask for. It's got your typical brunch wait but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Very unique and creative restaurant. There are school themed decorations all around, even drinks come in chemical beakers. We ordered chicken waffles and flapjacks for two. The foods are really delicious and servings are generous. We were stuffed by the end. I did not gave 5 stars because the service is extremely slow. We waited about 45 minutes for the food to arrive and it looks like the norm for other ppl as well. For a brunch menu this long wait is very frustrating."}
{"text":"The brunch here is very popular, in a very hipster environment, so you are fore warned!  Here is also another warning, if you don't arrive by 10 am or earlier, get ready to wait anywhere from 1 hour to 1.5 hours. The wait for this place is borderline ridiculous.   After we were finally seated, the servers are very friendly and the food was very good. I ordered the Smoked Salmon Croissant and it was simply delicious!!! At about $18 for a croissant, they were very generous with the amount of smoked salmon. I would recommend this place only if you did not have to wait. Would I wait another hour and a half to eat here again? Probably not."}
{"text":"Got here around lunchtime and it was pretty busy. We had to wait for probably 40mins? Once we got seated, the service was really good. However, the food was just ok. I tried the poutine and chicken and waffle but it didn't really give any wow factor. Also, they didn't have that many savory dish on the menu. I'll prolly go back once they add more things to it. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience at all."}
{"text":"School is one of my favourite brunch places. In the summer, if you're lucky, you'll score a seat on the patio which makes for a great morning meal outside when the temperature is just right. Regardless of when you go on the weekend, there is usually a quite a long wait (20-40mins) for 2. They do take your number and text you when your reservation is near. I've walked around Liberty Village for the two times that I've gone while waiting.  The decor of the restaurant is pretty cool. Everything is \"school\" themed - from the clocks and bookshelves to homework flying.  Now onto the food...its DELICIOUS.  Their menu is split so that those that have a sweet tooth can easily identify the sweeter items. I've tried:  - Stack'd High Buttermilk Pancakes - The pancakes are rich and its quite filling. Recommend sharing this dish with another friend's as the pancakes are just so fluffy and rich for one person.  - Fried Chicken Waffle - This is one of the most popular dishes at the restaurant (as you glance over other tables). Not sure when putting chicken on waffle became a thing, but School does it just right. The waffle is soft and the chicken is nice and crispy making for an ideal combination.  - Hashbrown Poutine - This veggie dish was a mixture hashbrown and some veggies. Tasty but I recommend trying the Chicken Waffle or Buttermilk Pancakes if its your first time visiting!"}
{"text":"Came here for its brunch. Ordered the pancakes that it's famous for, the krispy krunch french toast and hash brown. I was really looking forward to the pancakes, which turned out to be a bit disappointing. It was really fluffy but were very dry. The pancakes i tried at mildreds were way better.   The krispy krunch french toast is easily the best french toast ive ever had. Its perfectly flavoured with honey and hint of orange, krispy on the outside and the rice krispies just took it to a whole new level. It more than made up for the disappointing pancakes.   The hash brown is pretty standard, but it's all mashed up and with sour cream, not what my sister was expecting.   The waiting time here was pretty long. Waited for half an hour for the food to arrive. Also the food here was quite expensive. We spent 50 bucks on a brunch here so dont think we will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"3.5/5! It is never too late to go back to School!!   Naturally, the first thing I noticed is the decorations that reflect the \"school\" theme of the restaurant. All the clocks are set to 3:30PM, there are papers with scribbles hanging on from the ceiling, and of course, an apple on each table! Their menu are printed on lined papers and on clipboards, how cute! There are also chalkboard walls that explain the different meat cuts of a cow/pig.  -Chive biscuit - $3.50: I have always gotten sweet biscuits/scones so I was surprised to receive a savoury biscuit. It was hot and flaky, super delicious with a small hint of chives, and you can definitely tell these were homemade  -Blueberry Watermelon Lychee- $5.50  -Black 'n' Blue pancake - $12: These pancakes were ah-okay. I found them to be a bit denser, doughy and not as fluffy as the ones at Mildred. The pancakes were more of a plain pancake as they didn't have the blueberries incorporate within the mix, and the sauce is sweet with a hint of tartness. Nonetheless, I appreciate that they offer the syrup in a short glass as I can control how much sweetness I want. Also, the brown sugar butter was not needed, it served no purpose and didn't add any flavor to the pancakes for me.  -Headmaster Omelette w/ Gorgonzola - $16: The omelette was exceptionally tender, light and moist. While the omelette itself is bland, the gorgonzola cheese is quite salty so make sure to get the melted cheese with every bites :). I didn't think the omelette was worth $16 though..."}
{"text":"Was taken here on a business lunch on a week day. I must say I am quite the fan of anything with history and character, and this little one-room schoolhouse with its exposed brick, antique clocks on the wall and an apple on every \"desk\" warmed my heart before I even sat down at our table.  There was quite a long line as we went just after noon, but we had our names taken promptly and were sat in 15 minutes or so. Watching the chefs in the exposed kitchen and the cafeteria-style display of treats at the front counter got my mouth watering and kept me very well entertained. It also gave me ample time to food-creep.  There is quite the list of unique cocktails, many of which featured Bourbon if that's your thang. It wasn't a Mad Men work lunch for me, but I LOVED that their ice tea is fresh brewed and you can get it unsweetened and sweeten it yourself, American-style. One star just for that! The lunch menu wasn't very extensive, especially if you're not a brunch/eggs person (that eliminates half the menu right off the bat). That said, I had the jerk chicken and mango sandwich and my co-workers each had a salad and an egg dish, and we all really enjoyed our meals.   The only draw back was the service was incredibly slow, we waited over 30 minutes for our food and nearly missed our after-lunch meeting (a shame, really). That said, the place was packed and a waitress had apparently cut herself and they were one man down. The owner came out and spoke to everyone to make sure their meals were good, to explain the situation and offer her apologies. She even tracked us down after we paid and gave us a coupon to come back next time, apologizing again. I thought that was super sweet, and she seemed genuinely apologetic.   Overall, I would definitely come back to this cozy, quaint little hipster joint in Liberty V. They also have a small patio that will be calling my name this summer."}
{"text":"Finally made it here for brunch! Service was a bit slow on the patio for a late brunch, but the food was delicious and the drinks are amazing. The fried chicken in the chicken and waffles was quite tasty, especially with the house hot sauce, the sangria was great and the Safe Bet (three scrambled eggs with half a waffle) was good and filling. My only real complaint is that I wish my waffle was cooked a tad bit more. One more minute and they would have been perfection on a plate. The brown sugar butter is really, really hard to resist!"}
{"text":"Spot on. School is in session and I've just been edumacated. Hands down the best breakfast in liberty village. We're talking extraordinary culinary handiwork here ladies and gents.   The menu is straight forward. You get sweet or savory. The French toast is an inch and a half thick. The skillets and hash mixes are jammed full of awesome. The black and blue berry pancakes make the leaning tower of Pisa look like child's play.  Waiting twenty to thirty minutes for a table on Sunday at 10:30am is really not that bad compared to other places. If you haven't been to school yet then you need to go get your degree in brunching now."}
{"text":"Gord and I went to School for a late lunch/early supper today.  It's been a few years since we've been there.  It was such a nice day (sunny and 26C) so we sat on the patio.  I ordered the smoky BBQ chicken sandwich and Gord ordered the cheese burger.  My sandwich was delicious and I would order it again.  Gord said his cheeseburger was good and he would order it again.  Our server suggested Gord try their mojitos ... he did and found it delicious.  The food and service was good ... we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Made it over to School Resto with a couple friends on Saturday and had an amazing experience. There was a bit of a wait, we we had prepared ourselves for, but it only ended up being about 20 minutes which is rare for such an in demand brunch spot. I had trouble deciding because everything that was walked by me looked so incredible, but eventually chose the black and blue flapjacks. They were a bit too sweet considering I poured all the maple syrup on immediately, but the sourness from my blackberry, black cherry, ginger and lime juice of the day balanced it out really well. There is so much sweetness with the pancakes on their own, next time I'll add the syrup with a little more caution. If you can't decide between the sweet and savoury options, the hash brown side is a perfect choice."}
{"text":"Consistently good quality food. There's always a wait for brunch but their estimated wait times are usually bang on or shorter than what they say. Service is awesome and the food always arrives hot and fast."}
{"text":"I have tried many times to make it to this restaurant, it was worth the wait.. I had he blueberry flap jacks and they were outstanding. Great atmosphere, great customer service !! A+++"}
{"text":"So people say this is the best brunch place in Toronto. I don't think so, but it's up there.  For sunday brunches, i need some bernaise baby, and yes their benedict was amazing. I modded my brunch to add spinach and asapargus, but well worth the extra bucks.  The drinks are also really interesting, though i still think a traditional ceaser is what i need for a hangover.  go early, it gets busy, and it's perfect if you live in the area or are in the area. I would not however go with  a large group."}
{"text":"Good place for brunch. I was there for the first time right before Christmas, I got the chocolate croissant French toast and it was so good I came back the next weekend to make my friends try it. The decor is cute - all schoolroom-themed but in a nice, non-tacky way. If you're there when the place opens you'll hear the school bell too! It gets really busy though so be ready for a bit of a wait, and they won't seat you until your entire party is there, which is not really customer friendly. My friend asked for no coconut on her dish and was told they didn't make any substitutions/alterations so that was a little annoying, but otherwise the food was good and the place had great ambiance."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here two minutes until closing but they still welcomed us and even told us to take our time.  Drink refills were frequent food tasted great. The prices were a bit too pricey but the nice staff made up for it"}
{"text":"School has branded itself well. I like it! I also like how they're very integrated into social media channels and care about its business. That said, it's a pain in the ass to get to, especially if you live in the east end.  Homework time:   VIBE  The light in this school hall is fantastic as the decor is black chalkboards and black accouterments. The details from the bookcases to the report card envelope the check comes in are spot on.   Customers are hip and trendy Liberty Villagers, whether it's family, friends or a date. Staff are outfitted in school uniforms. A bit gimmicky but it works.   WE ATE  Well, it's all about the food here and I really enjoyed their brunch! We started off with berry smoothies that were made with items brought from the market that morning. Super fresh and a more interesting take than an orange juice (not sure if it's freshly squeezed here).   Nutella scones are spot on if you're waiting for a while. Our neighbours had the mini muffins and they looked delish.   We ordered the two most popular items on the menu: Cheesy French Toast - the perfect dish to have on a rainy, grey day like today. You could taste the freshness of the challah and the chewiness of the bacon on top added to the texture of this dish. The maple syrup in a mini beaker was a sweet ending. The side mixed salad was a good palate cleanser and obviously healthier than homefries.  My dining partner had the spicy eggs benny. The chipotle sauce had a kick to it; though the potatoes could have been cooked better they were a comforting indulgence.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK If this is school, I'll have perfect attendance. Their food isn't super original but it's comforting and made well. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'll start this review with a recommendation that if you are really really hungry, go somewhere else because the wait times are pretty crazy and that is the reason School dropped a star rating for me. To put things in perspective, we arrived at 1145am on Good Friday, and actually got our food somewhere around 230 pm. The wait to get a table was way more than an hour (they initially quoted 45 minutes so we walked over to get a balzacs coffee a few minutes walk away). The wait to get the food was very long too.  Onto the food. We were ravenous at that point but the food was pretty darn good! I had the bacon cheesy (done with jack cheddar) french toast which came with greens and a shot of maple syrup. I didn't need too much maple syrup but it was a nice touch to dip the French toast into. A lovely salty sweet combination. The mixed greens were ok, nothing spectacular but let's be honest, I wasn't there for the mixed greens! Meal was 18 dollars.   My friend got the poutine which is 15 dollars and added pulled pork for 3 bucks more. It had an egg on top which was a great touch! I got to have a bit and it was really tasty!   To finish off the meal we got the blueberry pancakes which had a delicious blueberry compote, brown butter and a shot of maple syrup. The compote is made in house and the brown butter was delicious too. There are 5 pancakes but they are really small so perfect to share as a dessert in my opinion, depending on what your main is.   For the 4 of us, with 5 main dishes if you include the dessert pancakes, 2 coffees, 3 boozy drinks at roughly 10 bucks each, the total bill with tax and tip came to around 150 bucks.  If you have great company (like I did!) and are perfectly fine spending time chatting and waiting for great food (again, like we did) then check it out! If you are in more of a rush, you may want to hold off for another day."}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. Arrived at the place with two friends at 11:50 a.m. on a Sunday after it was recommended to us. Got put on a waiting list and told to come back after an hour or two. We come back an hour later and get told it'll be another half hour to an hour. We leave and come back almost an hour later and witness the host seat two groups of two, both of whom arrived after us, at a table for four. When we questioned him about it, he fully brushed it off and told us it'll be \"just a few more minutes!\".   At this point we've been waiting for over two hours, so we decide to look at the menu and all chose the burger, seeing as we were starving at this point and there's limited meat on the menu. When we finally get seated and are ready to order, we get told we can't have the burger cause their kitchen is undergoing reno. And then when we finally get our orders of chicken and waffles and two egg skillets, the former tastes bland and the latter taste awful. It of course all ends with me having food poisoning for the next 2 days.   Incredibly long wait and hoity toity service with nothing good to fall back on cause the whole meal was disgusting. Simply not worth it. I'd give it a 0/5 if I could."}
{"text":"I was at School on a Friday afternoon with a revolving group of 10+ people and the service was exceptional. From 1:30p to 5:00p, when the staff switched over, we were taken care of by several courteous and attentive servers, enjoyed a tremendous meal (everything from eggs to salmon) and even offered separate bills.  As we worked through the cocktails list, the bartender came out to greet us and ask how we were enjoying the mixes, trying to get a better feel for how the new cockails list was being received. Smart. And later in the afternoon, he brought us all a taste of a new cocktail to try out. Brilliant.  Maybe it was the right time to go (I've heard issues about the weekend brunch service), but it was a fantastic experience and I'd be happy to return. And hopefully that banana cinnamon muffin tasting cocktail will be on the menu when I get back. Tasty!"}
{"text":"The rating is more of a 3.5 rather than 4 but the wait wasn't too bad and the service was quite fast hence they deserve the extra half star.   Came here with a friend on a Saturday afternoon. As expected, there was a line up and despite being told that there would be a 15-20 minute wait, we only waited about 10 minutes. When seated, we were promptly informed of their mimosa and caesar specials.   The drinks were good and the food arrived quite quickly. I ordered the chicken/waffle and it was quite tasty. It came with a side salad and sweet butter and syrup. The sides were also a very good size.   Overall, I would come back and do recommended this place for brunches!"}
{"text":"Soooo it's a rainy cozy fall morning, and the last place I want to be is at School or do I (-; The best part is they already had a bright red apple waiting for me at the table :-)  Ordered their Maple Pecan @ $16.50 Pancakes and Honeycomb tea $3.50 lets see if the hype is fake or am I about to get schooled by School..  What the F, OMG, are you freaking kidding me---as I am trying to get my brain and taste buds out of utter shock of this the best stack of pancakes I have ever laid my taste buds onto and why on earth I didn't come here soon enough!  As I like big butts and I can not lie, plays in the background , I am shaking it for their Maple Stack pancakes!! And yes I have been officially schooled by School!!!"}
{"text":"The food is quite good and a cool concept .   But,  be prepared for a wait.   Open tables and still  a 45 minute wait?   Service is also painfully slow.   Still waiting..."}
{"text":"When Richard M. and I FINALLY got together for a much needed brunch date, School was our first choice for venue. We had both been before so we were prepared for the somewhat slow service, but the Spiced Benni and Black & Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes were well worth the wait.  With schoolhouse touches like informative blackboard art, a wall of clocks, and apples on the tables, School has a fun, laid back vibe. There was lots of patio space and shade to be found, and luckily no wait for us on a long weekend (which is usually an issue at this spot).  The menu is divided into Sweet vs Salty and I can never choose between the two so I recommend bringing a friend to share with. Also, the coffee is not stellar - maybe try a smoothie or iced tea instead.  I'm impressed enough to go back again to try dinner."}
{"text":"This place is always packed so come a little early. Love the menu! So many things we wanted to try. I was deciding between the Millennial Toast and Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast. I asked for the server's recommendation. He said Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast so I went with that. Glad I did! The dish had great balance and variety of textures and flavours. Crispy and salty bacon, sweet and sticky maple syrup, savory and gooey cheese, eggy and soft french toast. We also ordered the Bacon Cheddar Burger. It was thick and juicy. Came with thin cut, crispy fries. Will definitely be back to try other items. Service was also excellent."}
{"text":"First the good: - Food.  Excellent quality and very fresh, - not too expensive  Now the bad: - SMOKE.  This place will ruin your clothes.  They have absolutely no ventilation on their cooking. Your hair, clothes will smell of bacon or whatever else they are cooking at the time when you leave the place.  You will smell as bad as if you had stood right next ro the kitchen and let the smoke hit you dead on.  I will not return here till they open the garage door in the summer so it's nicely ventilated.  Would have got a higher rating from me except for this major point."}
{"text":"I was looking on Yelp for a great place to go for breakfast.  I dont why School doesnt come up right away,  i had to search a long time before i came across it.  School is easy to get to with public transportation, just take the King street car, and then it is just a short walk from the stop.  Their are so many little elements to this place that have been so well thought out.  They use clipboards, chalkboards and apples in the most creative way.  Their menu was great, i chose the cheese french toast with bacon and a side salad.  You would think that they just use cheese bread, but they dont, i tried to create this dish at home and failed.  It was so good, and the bacon was thick cut and cooked perfectly, and the side salad was an unexpected treat.  My sis had the blueberry pancakes with real maple syrup.  There was a lot of fruit and the pancakes were light.  I cant wait to come back to this restaurant for supper next time.  BTW, when eating at School, sit outside if you can, they have a great patio."}
{"text":"i've been meaning to try this place as i'm in the area occasionally. a friend and i didn't have the time to sit down and eat so i went in and grabbed a cookie. the place was adorable, with two patios (front and side) which looked great. the inside was nice too, and their t-shirts were cute and said \"school\" on them in caps. very trendy. i was HORRIBLY disappointed in my cookie though. it was kind of raw i think. very gross. kind of like raw and wet at the same time... but burnt around the edges... it was very bizarre... i don't think i've ever seen cookies that bad. needless to say, as cute as it was i won't be returning for anything. all i can say is good thing i didn't have a whole meal there. it's also important to note that the service seemed a bit pretentious... you honestly have no reason to be... it's not like you're a swanky resto in yorkville, you cater to hippies and trendy scenesters, no need to be so stuck up. plus, you need to have some good food if you're gonna sport that attitude.. and the cookie was awful. i'm sure the other stuff isn't as bad (because, really, it would mean you'd have to be awful if you can cook food worse than that cookie... HORRIBLE cookie)... i don't think i would go back."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times have been spectacular. Be warned that the line is 30-60 minutes wait for the weekend brunch. The second time around my friends and I ordered a bunch of items so we could try a bit of everything. I ordered the Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast and it was heavenly. It comes with a little shot glass of maple syrup that I immediately drizzled all over my french toast. The cheese was melted all over the french toast so every time you took a piece of the toast, the cheese would become super stringy. My friends ordered the Millennial Toast (super flavourful with a bunch of different spices mixed into it), Golden Hash brown Poutine (definitely different than the traditional poutine because it did not have crispy fries but more of mashed home fries drizzled with gravy), and Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles (super delicious since the chicken was extra crispy). Each meal was a good portion for one person. Despite getting a meal each, we also ordered the Black n' Blue Flapjacks to share. The pancakes were thinly made and once again included a shot glass of maple syrup. We did not add as much maple syrup on this dish since the blueberry/blackberry jam was quite sweet itself. Overall an amazing experience and would 100% come here again."}
{"text":"The pancakes are as good in real life as they look on Instagram! Went here for brunch and loved everything. There was of course, a lineup but it moved quite quickly if you get there early enough. We waited for maybe 30 minutes. Fresh juice, great coffee, and delicious dishes! Found the staff to be personable and friendly. I didn't need to eat for the rest of the day!"}
{"text":"Visited here for the second time last week. Attempted to come here? 4 times.  The restaurant isn't huge, so their seatings are limited, if you come on the weekend, be prepared to wait for over one hour.  Hence why I've attempted to come here 4 times but only dined in twice, because I couldn't wait that long.  Especially in the fall/winter time, the patio is closed so their space is even more limited.  Luckily I came by on a weekday about 45 mins prior to their closing time at 3 and got in without any wait. The food here is expensive for brunch, that's for sure, but worth it, because it's phenomenal!  Service is pretty good I would say.  My favourite dish here is definitely the chicken & waffles!  If you haven't tried, the West Avenue Cider is bomb, by far my most favourite cider of all.  I remember asking my best friend after bringing him here for the first time... \"Would you come back again?\" (because that's usually how you know if they liked it), and he said...\"I'm going to have to come back so many times to try all the other dishes on the menu\".  So if you're looking to try this place out, come on a weekday, maybe even close to their closing time like I did that way you don't have to wait join the hour wait crew, plus you'll get the food quicker too!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much I made a trip from NY to Toronto so I could have my birthday brunch here! The atmosphere is just as awesome as the food: all \"school\" themed, from menus that look like notebook paper to drink/food names (the high school dropout Caesar), and my personal favorite element - they bump strictly hip-hop/rap. In my opinion, the best brunch item is their chicken and waffles. The breading is unlike any I've ever had (even down south) and the hot honey they serve with it is to die for! I've also tried the pecan/mascarpone pancakes, the brunch bowl, and the cheesy bacon French toast. Nothing here ever disappoints and the cocktails are super artsy, you should definitely give it a try if you're looking for a fun way to brunch!"}
{"text":"Worth the Sunday wait :)  I've been drolling over the Weekend Brunch dishes at School for years and finally made my way out during my Birthday weekend for a special treat...and boy was it special!  It was a beautiful sunny Sunday so I did not mind the 35 minute wait time.  Blood Orange Mimosa's to start! So refreshing. The Coffee was hot and fresh and the servers were great at doing their rounds for fill-ups. The Apple Crumble Pancakes -- I'm still drooling. A definite must have! The Chicken & Waffles - a great option for someone that likes sweet with a hint of savory & spice.  Can't wait to go back to School! :)"}
{"text":"Great place in a neat neighborhood. We were staying at the Gladstone and it was about a 10 min walk. Saturday morning it was very busy but we got there at the right time and didn't have to wait. Lots of outside seating. Sat on the back patio. Variety on the menu is awesome and most things savoury are served with greens which I love. My husband had the chicken and waffles and I had the extra cheesey French toast. Both were incredible. Also right next to two pokestops if u are into that. Service was excellent.  Worth the trip."}
{"text":"Crazy wait times BUT we got lucky and just asked for the booth / bar seats and skipped the line :) We only had a party of 2.  Chicken and waffles had Good taste and Texture. First time eating chicken and waffles. Coffee had refills and the bartender dude gave great service. Friend ordered Extra cheesy bacon french toast which was pretty good too.  The decor was very nice and trendy. Open kitchen concept brings a lot of great smells when you are eating.   Need to try more before considering upgrading to a 5. It's close even from going there once :)"}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to try this place this weekend and honestly I'm disappointed. It was myself and two other guests, who are both lactose intolerant. I got the chicken and waffles which was good, nothing amazing. For my guests however, we were basically told that the restaurant could not accommodate their allergy as there are no substitutions on the weekend! The odd thing was they had asked if anyone had food allergies upfront!My boyfriend had to have a Kale salad. You can imagine how happy he was with that...  Service was also really slow although our waiter was really nice.  This place has a cool vibe and the food is good, but with the amount of people with various food allergies these days, restaurants really need to take it into account or at least advertise that they're not allergy friendly so we don't waste our time and money."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch place in Toronto. School Restaurant gets super busy on weekends and you'll have to line up if you go late but it's so worth it. In the summers, you can sit outside at their patio too!  I highly recommend the Black and Blue Flapjacks - loaded with blueberries, maple syrup and whipped cream. It's amazing. We also got Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast which was a great savoury order to the sweet flapjacks!"}
{"text":"Get ready for an amazing breakfast.  Would suggest  planning on going to the gym this day as well... this place is all taste but high on calories!   Be sure to get the hash browns on the side, otherwise you will be regretting it when you see others with it at their table.    There will most likely we a wait but don't let this change your mind you can walk 5 min down the road to BALZACS coffee and they will text when your table is ready....  hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday morning. Once seated and orders taken the food took 45 minutes to come out. The food itself was mediocre, and for fairly expensive breakfast food (18 dollars for bad French toast) it is not worth the price. Service and venue is good and nice however. But it is hipster paradise."}
{"text":"Visited on a week night, and got the kale Caesar, super cheesey French toast, burger and artichoke bites. The French toast is the perfect altitude of sweet and salty with tonnes of melted cheese, the burger was juicy and fresh and the artichoke bites were so good I could hardly tell i was eating vegetables. Amazing service and clever decor. I've never had my ice water filled so rapidly and had such beautiful flower petals in my drink. MJ our server was polite, attentive and was never too close nor too far away. Washrooms that are designed in a way that represents a school as well as the wall of clocks added such a nice touch. Staff seem relaxed, happy and well treated."}
{"text":"The heaviest brunch meals are always the most memorable ones - the epic super cheesy bacon French toast ($18)  This dish was a heavenly sweet and savory combo. The layers: cheese, bacon, French toast, cheese, bacon, French toast and lastly with a crusted cheese layer at the bottom. The French toast was flavorful and I liked how it was served with the crust ends keeping it's crisp and not soggy. They were really generous with their bacon servings. The salad was a good refreshing side to compliment the heaviness of the French toast. If you ever pass by here for brunch, I highly recommend this dish!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was listed on a few sites' best brunch in Toronto...which kind of added to my disappointment.   First, I love the concept - a restaurant based on the idea of going to school; it even closes at 3:00pm!   Then I looked at the menu. This place is on the expensive end for brunch. Prices average around $18 per plate, and the drinks aren't cheap either.   Then the food. I got the skillet - eggs, sour cream, chipotle pork hash. It was good, but it wasn't good enough for the price I paid. The waffles looked pretty good - maybe I'd have been happier that way, but still, the price...  After our server took our order, we didn't see him until after we asked someone else for the bill. It was busy , sure, but I just expected at least a check up.   School is like, pretty good but not great - especially since elsewhere you can get food just as good or better at half the price."}
{"text":"Having already tried Aunties and Uncles as well as Bonjour Brioche a quick browse of the Toronto e-magazines led me to \"School\" - a seemingly worth the trip given the hours, online menu, and my enjoyment of long morning walks in the city.  Arriving shortly after 8:30am the restaurant was largely empty with only 4 other groups divided between the two main rooms.  Having walked through the rather redundant collection of condos, coffee shops, and gas stations en route I honestly had to wonder how people ever even decided to come to School given its location.  Browsing around the small main room I eyed the bakery counter as a tall, thin man yelled from across the room \"you can sit anywhere ya like.\"  Taking a seat in the middle of the dining room I browsed around at the kitschy concept - clocks, apples, chalkboards, bookshelves - and waited nearly 5 minutes before finally deciding to get up and help myself to a menu - a single piece of paper attached to a clipboard.  Browsing the \"all week brunch\" menu I instantly felt the bait-and-switch at play - the menu was approximately 1/3 the size of the online menu and lacked three of the items I'd considered ordering.  What was left on the menu, aside from oddly high prices given the lack of high-end ingredients, was admittedly interesting and as such I decided to sample two of the more unique choices.  With my decisions made easily 10 minutes before my sleepy-eyed (and questionably hung over) waiter made his way to my table I picked up a copy of the newspaper and entertained myself by reading about the Leafs, the HHoF inductions, and the game I'd been at the day before.  When my server finally arrived I placed my order for a coffee and two items - the coffee was Illy and was as good as expected - finally, a decent coffee at a brunch spot - unfortunately the selection of artificial sweeteners was \"nutrasweet only, bro.\"  Returning to my newspaper and listening to the awful children-singing-crappy-music soundtrack of the restaurant I next watched my server flirt with a young lady who'd entered only 1 minute ago, filling her coffee eagerly and taking her order for a parfait within 3 minutes of her sitting down.  Waiting only approximately 15 minutes before my pair of dishes was delivered my server brought the dishes to me and asked if I wanted a refill - assenting to this offer I set down my paper and settled in to enjoy.  Beginning first with the hot option, Orange Cinnamon French Toast with Valrhona Drizzle I was instantly displeased - the bread was essentially an undercooked (IE, doughy inside) thick white bread with minimal flavor, the oranges were no better than those sold at the local Wal-mart (No-Frills for the Canada crowd,) and there was so little chocolate sauce (note, the menu calls it \"sauce\" while I prefer drizzle) that I wondered how it could even be counted as an ingredient.  After many great breakfasts on previous trips I can undoubtedly state that this was the worst French Toast I've had in years.  Fairing somewhat better than the bread was my second dish - Toblerone and Banana with Frozen Nougat.  Essentially a whipped caramel-milk parfait topped with perhaps an ounce of Toblerone and 1/4 of a fresh banana the dish ate like a light ice-cream and was plenty sweet.  Tasting this early in the meal and being so bored with the \"toast\" I actually spooned nearly 1/2 of the nougat atop the French toast - the combination of the two, at $18, was actually pretty good - albeit lukewarm.  Thoroughly unimpressed with the service and food I requested another cup of coffee to go and having heard from a friend that their cupcakes were excellent decided to take a chance - selecting a Viva Puff and a Peanut Butter Banana to go.  Paying the bill I left a better-than-deserved tip and made my way out to the streets, saving the cupcakes for later.   While the Peanut Butter Banana was heavy and dull with a frosting that tasted largely of sugar crystals, banana flavoring, and an oiliness reminiscent of Crisco, the Viva Puff was actually quite superb with the fluffy marshmallow topping complimenting the deep chocolate cake well.  An additional surprise of the Viva Puff occurred on further mastication when a bite released a large pocket of delicious raspberry filling that made a mess of my hands, but a great memory on my tongue.  Overall I cannot imagine a single intelligent reason why one would go to School for breakfast unless perhaps they were a young female who only wanted a parfait.  While the cupcake was good and it was nice to finally find a diner/restaurant with good coffee, the service, scene, music, and food was vastly below average and the location obscure at best.  While Monday breakfasts in Toronto do appear to be few and far between, I personally think that even Tim Horton's is a more educated choice than School."}
{"text":"This restaurant is SO GOOD. We sat at the bar, so our service wasn't fabulous, but you could tell that the servers waiting tables were very attentive and helpful. We sat night next to the kitchen and got to watch the final touches be put on food. You can tell that the chefs are very passionate about what they do and you can definitely taste it too. The spot is great and the theme is so cute. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's me, but I haven't seen many themed restaurants in Toronto.   School Restaurant definitely gets an A in my books for that however! Best not be tardy though as this place is packed when it opens.  The decor makes the dining experience much more inviting than your traditional place. The menus are lined paper menus on clipboards, some drinks come in beakers, and your report card bill comes in a tiny little envelope.  On their menu, they've got a little bit of sweet and a little savoury. And some of their menu items change from time to time.  I got the Brunch Bowl: Spicy fried rice, Brava sauce, blistered tomatoes, spring onion, peppers, jalapeno sour cream and two sunny side up eggs. Probably wouldn't order it again (I really missed the meat in this one), but the rest of their dishes are excellent.  If you're a first timer, I would recommend their chicken and waffles, or the blueberry pancakes!  If you're in the area, give it a shot! It makes the grade for me."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to their avocado toast all week and when I finally had my first bite I was extremely disappointed. The bread was hard as a rock and I was given a flimsy butter knife to get through it. I had to request for a sharper knife because I kid you not, my hand was cramping up trying to cut this thing. I was excited for the mushroom bacon in the sandwich but disappointingly, I did not like the taste ; it was sweet with a weird texture. Along with this, the sandwich tasted like it had just been taken out of the freezer. So gross. It was over priced as well at $17+ for nothing spectacular. I would opt for a homemade avo toast any day. I will likely never return or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"OK - so it is shocking that I'd never been here ... it's just so damned quaint and cool.  Alas, I finally make it here for brunch at noon on a Saturday.  I'd been warned to expect a 30 minute wait.  There were only 3 groups of 2 ahead of us upon entering, and took over 10 minutes to be seated.  NOW - my confusion (aka beef) is that we easily could've been seated within 3-5 minutes, as there were 3 open tables when we walked in ... and 2 groups left in that time as well.  The hostess was not quick at firing patrons into these empty tables.  It didn't appear to be a staff shortage issue of any server getting slammed ... I think it is just their vibe that they are 'too cool for school' and want to have a bit of a queue. Onto the food ... cheesy french toast was great - with greens - not overly filling.  Fortunately, I sampled one of my hot date's eggs benny with peameal on a cheese scone, which was stellar.  So I was fully satisfied in the food department on this day. Decor was simple and clean ... school themed.  Not overdone.  Just right.  The small touches like b&w cartoons playing, an apple on the tables, chalkboards (one said \"i'm hot for teacher\"), or the servers outfits ... the theme works for this place. Toronto doesn't have enough great brunch spots like this ... the patio looked sensational, so I can't wait to hit this place during summer.  I'll gladly serve some detention here :)"}
{"text":"GOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Germany scored another goal against poor hapless England. Just like Germany who scored 4 goals, School Bakery & Cafe scored 4 stars. This place was rockin' with rabid German fans cheering on Deutschland and with the awesome brunch that School served.  This place is just plain AWESOME. Great scene -- the restaurant reflected the back-to-school theme with apples on the tables as centerpieces and textbooks on the shelves. They also have a really nice patio. Great place to eat on a nice sunny summer day.   I had the Overstuffed popover, which is scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, and hot peppers inside a split popover. Sincerely, this is one of the BEST brunches that I've ever had. I don't say this lightly because I LOVE brunch and I've had some incredible brunches. But, yes, this is right up there with THE BEST of them. The eggs were perfectly cooked, soft and tender, and so full of flavor with the hot peppers. The scrambled eggs on the crispy exterior and yet delicate and fluffy interior of the popover was a gourmand's nirvana. It was the best popover of my life. I whimpered when it was gone because like a crack addict, I wanted, nay, needed more.   School would receive a perfect grade from me once they get better coffee. Seriously, it's an insult to have such bad coffee when you serve such great food.   Don't bother ordering the maple-cranberry sausage if you actually want maple-cranberry sausage. It tastes like plain sausage. No maple or cranberry flavor whatsoever. Disappointing.  I think they must have been a little overwhelmed by having so many people over for the German-England game. The service wasn't the greatest. I don't mind waiting for the food, as they have an incredible number of people who all wanted their food at once, but little things that shouldn't have happened did occur, not only to my table, but surrounding tables as well. Someone had an item missing. I didn't get my sausage that I asked for. Another person wasn't given a spoon for his yogurt. They would come over give coffee to one person and then disappear with the pot before asking if anyone else at the table also wanted coffee (This seems to be a typical Toronto problem because it's something I regularly experience in TO, and not so much elsewhere.).  The baked good are really good. They're baked fresh on the premises. I would like them to be a little lighter and moister, but overall they're very good.   Big HD screen everywhere meant that you didn't have a bad seat in the house for watching World Cup.  GOOOOAAAAALLLLLL!!!!! Germany and School just scored again."}
{"text":"Been waiting to try this place for brunch for so long! First time here and it was such an amazing experience I'm definitely coming back and recommending it to others.   The food was amazing. The blackberry and blueberry flap jacks was really good. Really fluffy pancakes and loaded with fruit. Tastes amazing with the maple butter ?   The chicken and waffle was really good too. I could taste the chicken was a little bit dry but still better than most places. I can't wait to come try more of their menu items. I tried these two items cause I hear good things about them and it seems like popular items off Yelp. I wish I had the stomach for more!   The ambiance was fun, energetic, and casual. Just very positive vibes. The decor was cute and creative. The service was top notch. Everyone was very attentive and friendly. We got greeted and seated right away, and our server came around several times to check on us and top our water. Manager/supervisor also swung by to ensure everything was perfect. Food came out in a timely manner. Definitely an ideal place for brunch with a date or just catching up with friends."}
{"text":"This place is famous for their weekend brunch and the wait times reflect it. If you have a group of more than 2, go super early or get in around 2:30 (they finish serving at 3pm). The location is pretty small and groups are rarely in a rush to give up their table as long as the coffee is flowing. One side has a garage door that offers a nice breeze and opens up to a little patio. The extra seating in the summer doesn't seem to speed up their wait times, it only increases its popularity!  I highly recommend the chicken and waffles. This includes a side of spicy maple syrup - a combination that tastes delicious with everything!   There is easy street parking and a big parking lot across the street if you don't live in liberty village.  Don't feel like waiting in line? They offer breakfast and lunch on weekdays and its usually just a local crowd. They are never open for dinner - missed opportunity?"}
{"text":"I had never scored a restaurant before. But last Sunday was my worst rude brunch experience in a restaurant EVER!!!! That was not the first time I went to their restaurant, and they were doing ok before. Last Sunday,  I went there with several friends and we were kept waiting for our food for an HOUR after we were seated by a mean waitress. And during the waiting, no one even came to tell us what was going on with our f**king food. So after the long time waiting, we decided to leave cuz we were starving like hell. Then our food was magically placed in front of our face by the time we asked for the check! you know what, I knew their food, I've been there at least 3 times and every time I ordered the same thing, chicken and waffles. But this time, the food was the most ugly food I have ever seen. I would say that the pop eye chicken is WAYYYYY better than theirs! I only got 3 slices of waffles..... suppose to be a round shape....... I was so angry, they ruined our Sunday morning.... btw, I am always a big tipper, but I didn't give them a dime. The waitress did not even dare to ask why? cuz she knew why!!! I will never go to that restaurant again. BAD food and BAD services."}
{"text":"It's really hard to find places open mid-day for food in Liberty Village. After shaking my fist at a closed Chuck & Co. I decided to give School a chance to redeem itself from my last visit two years ago.   I was pleasantly surprised with both the menu changes and my cheery attentive waitress. I ordered the Chocolate Peanut Butter Banana Smoothie which was to die for along with a few sides : Cornmeal battered calamari and manchego fries. The calamari was great but I thought the fries fell flat.... still quite the improvement.  My boyfriend ordered the jerk chicken salad and it tasted fantastic. So for now I will bump School up to a three star..."}
{"text":"I like name of the restaurant very unique. This was my first time visiting with friends. I believe i ordered the chicken and friends. My first time having chicken in a different country. I love the juicy taste of the chicken. I love how they have an outside inside table structure  for the guest.  Most of the items on the menu are named after school related themes. I recommend coming back to this place but when it's cool outside because it was extremely hot outside when i went."}
{"text":"Terrible wait time but consistently good food and service every time. The hostess likes to combine lists while scores of people wait for the table and that makes for a lot of arguments between whose higher on the list. They need to adjust the waiting system.   The atmosphere is a must see for any new comer to Toronto- MUCH better than the likes of Wiliam's Landing. If you're going for something light, the smoked salmon salad hits the spot. I go once every few weeks to School and enjoy it almost every time. Take it from me though, go on weekdays and away from peak times."}
{"text":"This place has the BEST drink! It's a Blood Orange Juice, and it is phenomenal - highly recommend.  There is usually a long wait, so I'd plan ahead or make reservations.  The food is superb, and the portions are just right. Everything has a little kick to it and tastes very different, which I like. They spice things just right, and they are plated so perfectly.   One thing I did not like... the Candied Bacon.  I LOVE Bacon, but was not a fan of the candied bacon with my breakfast. However, my SO enjoyed it - it's just a personal preference.   Would definitely recommend going. Perfect spot for a Girls' brunch!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place a lot more.  We waited less than 10 minutes for a table despite being quoted 20-25 when we arrived.  The menu is a great mix of sweet and savoury dishes. They definitely put more thought into it than most places do for brunch (though I suppose they should, given they only serve brunch). Lots of meat and non-egg-based choices for people who don't want to eat huevos rancheros and eggs florentine every time they eat brunch.  I had the chicken and waffles, billed as a \"Chef's Favourite.\" Lots of other people seemed to be ordering them as well. I wasn't that impressed -- chicken and waffles were both a little dry, though I did enjoy the Tabasco-maple syrup.  Better than most for brunch -- but that's not necessarily saying much."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch, I love this place.  And it's literally looks like a classroom. I got my usual the super cheesy bacon french toast.  And I'm not a fan of sweet breakfast,  this is the perfect mix of sweet savoury and great side Salad to balance out the flavours.  Had the blood orange mimosa. My Friend had the skillet and that was really good taste as well, the chorizo was well flavoured. My only gripe is the long wait for a table and they only give you 5 mins ro get to there once they text/call.. But totally worth it."}
{"text":"About 3 years ago, I went there and left with a great impression and wanted to go back for their hash browns.   So I did and left disappointed and it was certainly not worth it.   Happy:  service was good. I had the waffle and chicken entree. The chicken was hot and came with a nice dipping sauce.   Not happy:  waffle wasn't crispy. Nothing special about it. The coleslaw of red cabbage and carrot was not fresh as it had a certain sourness to it. My partner had the French toast and at the end he said it was mediocre. Just a piece of thick toast for like $15.   Verdict: Too expensive for an entree dish. Wished I had the lunch menu. Definitely not worth the money. Won't be back unless someone is treating me.  Some fruits would have been nice since it was a brunch menu."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and I am glad I did. The place has a great comfy atmosphere and played up the school theme very well, down to the apples on the tables and the waitresses in their cute school girl outfits.  I ordered the coconut and kaffir lime chicken pot pie and it was excellent. The flakey buttery pastry was perfect and the stewed chicken was delicious -- I love pot pie and I love curry and this was an excellent combination. The only criticism was that the chicken was a little overcooked. The pie came with a side salad which was nicely dressed with a sharp caesar dressing. I had a chai tea which was served loose with it's own little steeping cup which was a nice touch.  Service was excellent. Attentive, courteous and prompt.  Their brunch menu looked really good -- I will definitely be back for that. I was there one weekend morning, but didn't want to endure the hour wait for a table, and the place seemed very smokey and stuffy from the poor kitchen ventilation. In the summertime they have a very nice patio and the garage doors at the front of the restaurant opens up, which creates a very lively after school happy hour."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm SO happy I came here for brunch last weekend.   To begin, the wait time is horrible! We had to wait around 1-2 hours, but we didn't mind. It's better to go check-in with them after 30-45 minutes though, just incase there is space.  Our waitress was super kind, even though the service was a bit slow, she was helpful and checked up on us here and there. I wasn't super picky on how often she came to check up on us and what not, because the restaurant was crazy packed!! I was surprised our waitress was even coming around checking up on people the amount of times she did.  For drinks, I got the blood orange mimosa, which was so good! My boyfriend got the maple latte and apparently that was really good.  For food, I got the apple crumble pancakes and let me tell you this.. out of my 23 years, these are the BEST pancakes I have ever tried in my life (sorry mom, yours is still amazing though)!! The pancakes were so fluffy and much bigger than regular pancakes you'd get at brunch spots. Definitely worth the money. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles and WOW, it was SO good! I never had chicken and waffles that good before. We also got pan-fried hashbrowns with jalapeño sour cream. Again, it was the best hashbrowns I have ever had!!  I'm telling you, the hype for this place is real! You have to go! Thank me later :)"}
{"text":"I am a brunch enthusiast and if you love bruch - this is the place to be.  I love eggs, pancakes, waffles, sandwiches... and their food is delicious, savoury, fresh, local!  I'd like to mention that I love to go on weekdays as weekends are crazy busy.  Staff - friendly, fun and professional.  Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"School is just about everything that brunch should be. My friend and I were visiting Toronto a few weeks ago and were given this recommendation by a random stranger that we ended up talking to the previous night. And I'm so glad she told us!  I love the quirky schoolhouse theme, with apples on the tables, clocks set to 3:30PM, and Saved by the Bell playing silently on the TVs. This is clearly a popular spot, as we walked into a crowd of people waiting for tables. Even on a busy Saturday morning our wait was only about 45 minutes, which is about what we expected.   To fulfill a desperate need for caffeine, I ordered the maple latte. I'm not usually into flavored lattes, but being a visitor in Canada for the first time, it just felt right. I'm glad that I did--the latte was very well made, with a thin layer of silky foam atop the delicious and creamy milk and espresso. The drink was not overly sweet, with just enough maple flavor to compliment the espresso.  I couldn't resist ordering the Golden Hashbrown Poutine. The idea of poutine for breakfast sounded pretty awesome, and the dish certainly delivered. The generous portion of hashbrowns (the shredded/chopped variety) contained braised leeks, with a fried egg on top and tomato jam on the side (all, of course, served atop savory gravy). The combination of flavors was delicious. I liked the nontraditional take on poutine; they really did a great job of taking those familiar flavors and elevating it to a unique brunch/breakfast dish.  The only thing keeping me from giving five stars on this one is that the food took a looong time to come out--probably close to 45 minutes. That being said, if you have the time to spare it'll be worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. They got yummy scones out and different brunch dishes to choose from.  we ordered a bunch of dishes which were different and tasty.   Gotta get there early on the weekends cus it can get pretty packed and you might have to wait long for a table."}
{"text":"I had the chicken and waffles and it was so good!  The tabasco sauce added just the right amount of spice for the chicken.  I ate the entire plate.  I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to go if it's your birthday and you need to make a slight menu alteration! Such horrible experience when we simply asked to \"hold the bacon\". Not sure why the manager and owner was adamant about no substitutions but we got up and left immediately! Turned a birthday celebration into massive disappointment. Absolutely inexcusable. It's not like this kitchen is a Michelin Restaurant.  I would advise anyone contemplating visiting this establishment to go elsewhere. The owner has a misguided sense of entitlement...."}
{"text":"What to try:  Definitely try their most popular brunch items including the buttermilk fried chicken waffles, the cheesy bacon French toast or the Black n Blue Flapjacks. We tried the chicken waffles and the French toast and if you're a die hard chicken and waffles fan, you can try the seasoning they used for their fried batter. Might be different from the other restaurants you've been to. I was more of a fan of the French toast not only because it was really gooey with cheese, but I liked the maple syrup soaked bacon that came with it. But I have to warn you, the French toast can look like it's drenched in oil because it's covered with a spread of butter too! Both served with Ontario no 2 maple syrup! Finally, I t was hard not to get the Flapjacks too because I wanted to compare its taste with Mildred Temples! The stack of pancake just looked so mouth watering good when I saw it come out from the Kitchen.  Last tips:  Try to go after 2 pm if you want to avoid a line up, or get a reservation ahead of time or else be prepared to wait 20-30 min to be seated! The Caesars are $2 off on Sundays!! What a great way to compliment a brunch! Finally, try the Flapjacks if you have a sweet tooth and love pancakes. Def make a good food porn picture!"}
{"text":"Been hearing a lot of hype surround school so decided to give it a try. Went with my two girlfriends and we split three dishes. The chicken and waffles came with perfectly fluffy and light waffles and this amazing salted butter on the side. The seared tuna salad was light and tasty with sliced mangos  which were a perfect touch. The cheese and bacon French toast was nothing special. The salad on the side was not as good as the seared tuna salad as it came with a different dressing. Each dish was $18-$19. Would definitely recommend this restaurant for some light brunch with friends."}
{"text":"This is quite a unique place. Good place to have conversations about your school days if your an old-timer (aka not a millennial HA!). There's plenty of patio space and average room indoors. We got a table pretty quick considering their steadily busy. The service just took a little while (we came in hungry but waited patiently for someone to come and take our order). I had the pecan pancakes which were okay and my boyfriend had the cheesy french toast. They were both okay (i preferred the mascarpone more than the pancake itself though!)"}
{"text":"Overly complicated brunch options, offered at high prices. The dishes are ok, but I don't understand why there is no standard bacon, eggs, toast, or omelette or eggs Benedict on the menu at a brunch place. Plus the music is cranked up super loud, which is fine in the evening, but not at 11 am."}
{"text":"Liberty Village is a very nice neighbourhood, particularly on a warm, sunny day. School had the perfect atmosphere for a lazy brunch.  Out of the two dishes, my favourite was undoubtedly the spiced benni on cheddar chive biscuit with back bacon, chipotle hollandaise and home fries. The chipotle hollandaise was simply divine! The chipotle really gave the sauce a great kick. As well, the eggs were nicely poached and perfectly runny inside. The only thing I wasn't crazy about were the home fries, which were rather chunky and dry.  I also enjoyed my super cheesy French toast with double smoked bacon, maple syrup and greens. I loved the combination of the savoury cheese and maple syrup, which made the French toast all the more decadent. The refreshing side salad was much needed to counterbalance all that fatty richness.  For dessert, we got a chewy chocolate chip cookie to go, which was super chocolatey but not that chewy. I couldn't eat this without getting chocolate stains all over my hands. I wished that the cookie was more chewy and less chocolatey. But all in all, it was an enjoyable, coma-inducing brunch."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday around noon, and did NOT have to wait. Got a table for 2 and was seated immediately. Pretty awesome since i was anticipating some kind of wait time.   Service was great. Our server and the manager i guess were attentive and made sure we were okay. Their service was appreciated as the restaurant was PACKED and they still made time to check on us.  The $2 off Caesar was not good at all. It was almost tasteless and super watered-down. So I would recommend getting just a coffee or a juice here and going to a bar after brunch for some real drinks.  The food:  Chicken waffles: 5/10 - the chicken pieces were dry, waffles were just waffles - nothing special. The coleslaw I think was the worse coleslaw I have had in a long time. It was almost tasteless but had a bit of a buttery taste, and had a really bad after-taste. The waffles came with honey as opposed to maple syrup, and this may have been the reason why everything just tasted a bit off.  Breakfast burger: 6/10 - the burger was okay but once again nothing too exciting and unique. However, the fries were great!  Everything here seems to be plated nicely to make the food look exciting and delicious but once you take a bite of it, you will soon realize there's nothing special about the food here. I think the pictures I have seen of the foods served here have got my hopes up about this restaurant. I was quite disappointed but I was happy that we did not have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in West TO. As long as you are prepared to wait or come when it's not busy.  Staff is always friendly even when they are slammed. Try anything on the menu it will mostly likely be bomb."}
{"text":"I'll actually start with the negative, to get it out of the way: The prices add up quickly.  On average, expect to pay about $18-28/person. That would be for a main ($11-$20), a non-alcoholic drink ($3.50), and a baked treat.  The main would have been filling enough.  We ordered a muffin to tide both our toddler and myself over.  Food takes a reasonable amount of waiting time.  Drinks were served promptly.  Our group had 4 adults and two toddlers.  They do not have high chairs but they do have booster chairs there.  The place was quite full, but we were lucky and they were able to accommodate us.  We had family from out of town, and they were pretty satisfied!  They ordered the waffles + chicken; an omelet? sandwich with bacon and cheese; we had fluffy buttermilk pancakes and huevos rancheros.  The toddlers split an order of the buttermilk pancakes and had some fresh fruit salad (pineapples, blueberries, strawberries, ...).  Everything was SO good.  Again.  I'm a sucker for maple syrup and whipped cream.  (We don't usually buy whipped cream, so I go a bit nuts when I'm able to have it every few or more months).  Yes, I'd recommend this place.  Also, I'd come again.  I would try to not come too often, since everything does add up pretty quickly.  Still, it was a meal to remember, and I was proud that our out of town guests were able to experience quite the positive meal!  The decor is pretty school too.  I mean, pretty \"cool\", too.  Large sizes of OJ were served in beakers!  Open books, were used as partial lampshades, the bill arrived on a school like report envelope.  Decor details... were great and amusing.  Final thoughts: Expensive but Gourmet place.  Trendy hotspot that locals and non-locals alike, appreciate."}
{"text":"Summary: Horrible wait time, many ridiculous rules, a bit pricy, the food does not worth the wait Place: 4/5 (has nice patio, good environment) Food: 3/5 (good, but does not worth the wait, and does not worth the price) Wait time: 2 hours for us. 1 hour in line and 1 hour from sitting and getting our food Service: 2/5 (friendly service, but ridiculous rules) Price: over 20 per person  We got a large group here. About 7 of us. We came around 11 am on a weekend, it took us 1 hour in line and 1 hour to get our food. The wait time is ridiculous and the place got interesting rules as well. We got 7 people and apparently we could not take table with more than 6 people. Then what do we suppose to do? We still sit at same table, but we got 2 waiters serve us separately. One our us made the comment \"it is like a German school\". I ordered the famous Fried Chicken waffles. The Friend Chicken was good, but the waffles is just OK. The dish took us 20 minutes to finish because we were so hungry. Some of us ordered French toast, which was way too sweet. This is a popular spot. I would probably not come back, since it requires some travel for me. Not recommend. Recommend if you are in the neighbourhood and the wait time is short."}
{"text":"This was my first time stopping by school. No reservation and quick service was key, as most restaurants in the area had hour long wait lists prior to the TFC game. $2 off Muskoka draft was necessary, considering the steep $8 regular cost. It's obvious that the menu is creatively crafted - delicious and unique. Food pricing is fair based on quality and taste. Would definitely recommend and stop by again."}
{"text":"L-O-V-E, LOVE!  I LOVE this place. Honestly, I went there for the first time last Saturday and I can't stop raving about how great my breakfast was and how I can't wait to go back.   Let's start with the decor. It's called School, so think chalkboards, book shelves, apples sitting on small plates as centrepieces for the table, super cute. They also have 2 patios one at the front and one at the side.  Actually, now that I think about it, the patio may just wrap around.  Regardless, there's a patio and it's big.   As I mentioned I was there for breakfast so I ordered the Spiced Benni. I HIGHLY recommend this plate of deliciousness. I asked for the chipotle hollandaise on the side (that was the only modification I made) but really it kicked the eggs up to a whole new level. As if the hollandaise wasn't enough the cheddar chive biscuit, DELIGHTFUL! Not only was my meal perfect but the people I was with all had the same enthusiasm for theirs as well. Not to mention the food being delivered to the other tables looked just as good.   As for the baked goods, I'll be honest and say I didn't really get to the try them except for a taste of the Banana Espresso Muffin. One word: delicious. Try it.   I wanted to order sangria however, it was before 11:30am so we were unable to do that. The upside, you may ask, their coffee was just as good as their food. Now to you non-coffee drinkers this probably doesn't mean much to you but for those who can appreciate a cup of java, you won't be disappointed.   I didn't get a chance to check out that bathrooms and as every seasoned restaurant goer knows that's key on your overall judgement of the place, I'm still giving School 5 out 5 stars.   The staff was very friendly and our waitress was great. She answered any questions we had about the menu and made sure everything was to our liking. If I could remember her name I'd just here a shout out here because she was awesome.   I'd suggest you check out the website as well to see what's happening since they seem to have different events that go on. However, every Monday - Friday from 3:30 - 7pm there's \"Detention- good drinks for bad kids\"  and \"Night School\" which is then serving dinner from 5 - 11pm Wednesday  - Sunday. But check out what's going on from their website, they seem to keep it up-to-date.   Basically here's how I see it. School uses the theme of school throughout the whole restaurant and I love it. The extra effort with the small details really ties this place together.  If it's for breakfast, lunch or dinner I'm giving School 5 stars. Love it."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. The food alone would have resulted in a four star rating. However, he place is a little understaffed. Waiting times are quite high, we had to threaten them with an allergy to get the Gorgonzola out of my wife's omelette.  If you come with a group of friends, make sure you all come together since they won't sit you otherwise. We had to wait at the bar for 20 minutes until our friend arrived. Had she come a little later, all the tables would have been fully up and we would have to wait for another 30 minutes!  One of the meals was prepared wrong (no bacon for vegetarians!) which can always happen. They promised to \"put it at the top of the line\" but we had to wait for another 30 minutes until it arrived. At he same time we saw the same dish being delivered to 5 other tables!!  We talked to the waiter (who was really nice BTW) about this and suggested an improvement. A short time later, the manager arrived at our table to apologize. However, when we wanted to give him his feedback, he was just rude, interrupting us: \"I know what you are going to say\" and not willing to listen to anything. Every MacDonalds employee is more professional than this guy."}
{"text":"I wish eating pancakes was part of my homework back in the day, because I would get A+ in all my classes.   Walking into this restaurant, the interior decor immediately took me back to my elementary school days (no responsibilities, stress-free). Everything from the lockers, chalkboards, and all the clocks frozen at 3:00pm (that magical time of the day) reminded me how quickly time has passed by, and how old I feel. I've only been to a handful of places for brunch (Mildred's, Starving Artist, Insomnia etc.), and School is definitely up there on my list of top favourites.  Go early, otherwise you may end up waiting an hour for a table!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best breakfast places in Toronto that I have experienced. The line was a 40 minute wait on a cold Sunday morning but (excuse my language) GOD DAMN was it worth every minute.   The French toast and pancakes here are unreal! Huge, fluffy and delicious. The sugar bacon is to die for!   Very hip and relaxed. The perfect place to eat breakfast, relax and have a cup of Joe after a night out partying/drinking my self to sleep."}
{"text":"Long line ups but got in fairly quick this time. Ordered chicken and waffles. Delicious!! Fresh squeezed juice. Pear ginger and orange. Needed more zip of ginger.  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes such as hash brown poutine and cheesy French toasts..... Drool. This place knows my heart lol  4/5 for presentation , service, food"}
{"text":"A friend came back from here a couple weeks ago raving about how good the breakfast was. We decided to check it out based on the glowing review and we were not disappointed. It look really busy when we arrived but were seated immediately. We were waiting on a friend so our server took out drink order right away. Drinks were served quickly! As soon as our friend arrived our breakfast orders were taken. The food did take a while to come, but when it arrived it was hot and delicious! I ordered the Super Cheesy French Toast, my husband got the Spiced Benni on a Cheddar Chive Biscuit,  and our friend got the Melted Gooey Four Cheese Omelet Souffle.  How good do those dishes sound!  All three breakfast dishes were amazing. I would come back and order any one of these dishes again or try something new. Its a bit pricey, for breakfast, but worth it in my mind. The bakery at the front looked great too. Next time I need to pick up some tasty treats on the way out :)"}
{"text":"This place was hands-down the cutest restaurant for brunch. The whole place is school themed and is perfectly cheeky with how it's done. Their menu is labeled with school related things like principals office and first period etc., their juices come in beakers, all the clocks on the wall are set to 3 o'clock when schools out, and your check comes in a report card. If that wasn't fun enough their food is also amazing. Their juices are fresh fun flavors that taste delicious. I ordered the pair basil and it was perfect. Then we received our food and we were not disappointed at all. The French toast with rhubarb was as good as it sounds as was the apple crumble pancakes. They give you generous portions and it's definitely worth what you pay.."}
{"text":"Well, it's definitely worthy the wait. The cheesy bacon French toast brought me to the heaven. :-)"}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriends for a Saturday morning brunch date.   Was told that our wait time was going to be ~45 minutes, turned out we were seated after 30 minutes of waiting, which was great.  We ordered the teacher's pet (11$; 4 freshly basked goods of your choice-- 3 jalapeno chive biscuits and a corn bread), 12 hour braised pork (18$) and egg and the cheesy bacon french toast (18$).  The food was mediocre, at best. The biscuits were served cold. What a disappointment as they were advertised as \"freshly baked.\" Their corn bread was nothing left to be desired. It had a huge corn flavour, though I personally found it slightly dry.  40 minutes of waiting later, our food arrived.  The 12 hour braised pork and eggs was a huge disappointment. I figured if braised the pork for 12 hours it should be flavourful, but boy was I wrong! It was soooo terribly bland tasting. The only thing that really gave it any flavour was the runny yolk mixed in from the eggs. The hash served with the meal was meh. There were nacho chips placed on top of my dish, which seemed weird and out of place to me... I didn't know how to eat it with the rest of my meal.  I had a taste of my friend's cheesy bacon french toast and it was something I could easily make at home myself. There was only one slice of bacon that was adorned on top, which doesn't make sense if you knew just how BIG the portion of french toast was... and for that price? Think again.  Our server was really attentive, and the atmosphere was fun and quirky with school paraphernalia located all around the restaurant, rightfully so. With that said, I would not come here again. SCHOOL is overrated, I'd go to Mildred's instead for brunch.  Bonus: there is free parking (!!!) on weekends BEHIND the building on Fraser Ave. DO NOT give in to the $$Green P$$! Just note, the alleyway is hidden."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Sunday with a fairly big group. We waited maybe 20 minutes for a table which really isn't too bad of a wait considering it was Sunday at 1 pm (prime brunch time).  When it comes to the food, this is a place that does really decadent meals. So if you want some eggs and bacon, this is not the place. I ordered their Super Cheesy Bacon French Toast. It was French toast slathered with cheese and bacon and maple syrup. It was rich and not the nutritious healthy breakfast you may be used to but quite tasty. My husband ordered their burger which was decent. Our other friends ordered the Chicken and Waffles which was pretty tasty and the Smoked Salmon Scramble which was probably the healthiest item in their menu.  One thing I did not appreciate about this place is how strict they were with changes or substitutions. One girl wanted to change a croissant for a toast and they said they don't have toast. And my husband wanted to have a bun less burger and wanted his fries replaced with salad. They said he had to removes the burger himself once he gets it because they can make it bun less in the kitchen. And they also said he had to order the salad separately. Even though my meal came with a side salad so not quite sure why they couldn't just give him a salad instead of fries. So my husband had to order a separate side salad and the fries just went to waste.   All in all, food was good but nothing great and service was good for the most part until they started to say no to everything we wanted."}
