{"text":"It was late, and I was hungry. This place was down the street from my hotel, and open. I didn't want McDonalds. There was only one guy in the place, so I figured I'd get some take-out. The proprietor came out, took my order, and promptly disappeared to the back. The Patron left, and I was alone in this dimly lit, frankly scary restaurant. All the other businesses surrounding it were closed. Here's what was weird-there was really no sound coming from the back room. Usually in a Chinese Joint, you hear the scraping of Spatula against Wok, but tonight....silence. No talking, no radio, nothing. Spooky! And it took a long time to get my stuff. I entertained the thought that the rude owner had ducked out the back door to go to another restaurant to get my food. I had some Cantonese chow mein which was boring, and an order of Crab Rangoon which weren't bad. So there."}
{"text":"I wouldn't suggest anyone to go here unless you're really desperate and hungry for absolutely anything. This is not a place where you take a person to a date, doesn't look great and the servers are sometimes unfriendly. This place gets filled at lunch time by the near by high school so i would suggest any over over the age of adolescents to find somewhere else to have your lunch break."}
{"text":"My cousin has been referring me to this restaurant for years until I took it upon myself to give them a try. There wasnt much on the menu to start with, so i ordered fried chicken and chips. I was upset in the little amount of chips they gave me. The fried chicken was not chicken. They served me duck. In addition, they gave me no name brand ketchup. I found that so desrepectful. I wouldnt recommend anyone to eat from them. The dining area was filthy, the floor needed to be mopped, the table was dirty and the chairs were wobbly."}
{"text":"I'm a fan because of their Spicy chicken are Awesome..  The place is sort of ghetto tho..    I wouldn't eat in during night time.. take-out is fine tho.

They are licensed and close late for a restaurant so you can grab a beer here if convenient.. 

Lunch menu looks good and not expensive."}
{"text":"During my four years as a high school student at Woburn Collegiate Institute down the road, this was a restaurant we frequented. Looking back, I have no idea why.

Food isnt even mediocre. It's actually pretty gross. The rice is stale and dry, the chicken/beef/ whatever meat you get feels like it was made yesterday, and the sauce is pretty disgusting.

The atmosphere is akin to the restaurant featured in the Godfather, where Michael Corleone shot those two guys. It feels grim and dark, and pretty ghetto. I legitimately wouldn't be surprised if someone got shot here.

The hygiene of the place is great, if you're a director looking for a scene of a disgusting dump. Unmopped floors, smelly toilets, flies all over.

Once, during lunchtime hours, when 12-15 students lined up for food, I saw a group of 3 students walk in and call the store owner some provocative names. The store owner then took a broom and chased them out, while yelling some not so kind words. That fiasco lasted over 10 minutes, and I didn't get my food in time for class that day.

The one redeeming quality is the lunch special - 5$ for a boxed lunch + drink. It tastes like crap but you'll be full and you'll only have paid 5$.

If anything, come to Woburn Garden for the experience, not for the food."}
