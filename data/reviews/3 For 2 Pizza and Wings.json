{"text":"My niece goes to class at the music academy, so one day when we left she asked for pizza. I saw this place and that was it. She is in love with it, she even said it taste better than pizza pizza, and for a 5 year old as picky as her thats impressive. She ate 5 slices by the time we got home which is down the street. 

The pizza is so cheesy and tasty you have to try it at least once for yourself."}

{"text":"This is a nice and bright pizza joint located in a strip mall in Mississauga. At first, I was underwhelmed by the service as I found myself standing for 5 minutes alone in an EMPTY restaurant, no staff, no other patrons, I was ready to walk out. However, just when I was going to turn around and leave, the store clerk returned to take my order. This place is advertising all over its store a new creation of a panzerotti with a hot dog cooked inside, along with the traditional tomato sauce and cheese. Those ads peaked my curiosity and I had to give this dish a try. I decided to splurge and get a combo. The service continued to be fairly latent as I could tell they hadn't put my panzerotti in the oven until I returned 15 minutes after placing my order to pick it up. Still there were no other customers in the store. As bright as the restaurant is, it's needing a renovation badly. The panelling is falling off the walls, the menu is burnt out and they had literally only about 10 cans of pop in a 4 door fridge.

Up until I left with my food, this place was a clear 1 star. However, I opened the take-out container and my whole opinion of this place changed. The fries that I was hesitant to order were delicious, crispy and golden brown. They reminded me of the type that Red Lobster served before their most recent upgrade. The panzerotti on initial glance was not golden brown but pale white (as if they took the cooked panzerotti and covered it in flour). I thought to myself \"what did I order?\" until I tasted it. My opinion definitely changed, they're onto something with this creation. The hot dog had a street dog taste wrapped in a delicious cheese pizza. The price for a combo was very reasonable for the amount of food received. 

The majority of their menu is priced to encourage those to order three of whatever it is they want (3 pizzas, 3 portions of wings) but none of their prices are unreasonable. I wish I could rationalize travelling the 20 minutes it takes to get there more often but unfortunately I know there are equally as good pizza places closer to home. However, for those who are in the area, I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The appearance is pretty underwhelming with barely any staff or other patrons around BUT as cliche as it is, you truly can't judge a book by its cover because the pizza here is delicious! I'd pick this place any day over the traditional pizza pizzas, dominos and other chain pizza joints out there. I find most places tend to overcook the crust till the pizza is a hard, chewy mess but the pizza here was cooked just right. It's also very affordable compared to a lot of places out there! Don't let the empty store turn you away because the quality of the food here for the price is really hard to beat!"}
