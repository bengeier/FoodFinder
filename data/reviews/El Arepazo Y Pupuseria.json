{"text":"The Steak Arepa here is my favorite. The fries are excellent, but I prefer the Yuca substitute for .49 more. You get an excellent arepa, which is better than the ones at Barroco's in Lakewood, IMO, and so much delicious steak. It is a great dish. The pupusas you get from here are another dish you can't go wrong with."}
{"text":"The food was awesome!  Loved the cheese and flower papusa, guacamole, pico de gallo, yuca and taco. We will definitely be back. They were super busy, so service was a little slow, but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Went for the arepas, but wasn't too thrilled with them.  Barocco in Lakewood is much tastier.  The empanada we had was good, but not enough to make me come back.  The decor is a bit strange & the server we had was not too bad but wasn't the most pleasant either.  Bottom line - if you are looking for arepas, go to Barocco."}
{"text":"We visited this establishment a few months ago, midday on a quiet afternoon.  The interior is basic, kind of small which is fine because the focus here is truly on their wonderful food. The waitress was attentive and our food was brought out quickly.    There were many items on the menu I wanted to try but I really love empanadas and arepas so that's what I went with. Hands down the best I've ever had.   We started with the cheese empanadas. The corn pastry dough tasted so fresh and flavorful. They were served with chopped veggies like tomato, onion on the side. They added great flavor and some crunch to the empanada. Next was the vegetarian arepa.  Just heaven on a plate! My father who is most definitely not a vegetarian (and ordered a pupusas) was so impressed he said that's what he wanted to get next time.  And not to be forgotten, the sauces..As other reviewers have said just incredible. They should really bottle and sell them! So delicious.   The prices are really very reasonable and the portions are huge. I was happy to have leftovers so I could enjoy the food again.   Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We come here for pupusas, and can't really vouch for the rest of the menu, but their pupusas are worth it. Quick friendly staff and good prices. Inside restaurant is ok. Clean, and restrooms are clean.   If you come we recommend the Pupusas revueltas (pork, beans and cheese) and the Queso con loroco (cheese and loroco flower) sweet plantains and cream are good too."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!  My partner and I traveled to Colombia a few years ago, and have been searching for delicious Colombian food ever since. We were THRILLED to find this restaurant. It is small and very casual. The Bandeja Paisa is awesome and we would recommend it to anyone. We were delighted to find that they even sell come of the Colombian beers and sodas we had while we were there. We tried Pupusas for the first time at this place, and we really enjoyed them. Sometimes it can be a little slow, but this is a small restaurant, so you gotta be understanding. And the food is well worth the wait, and very reasonably priced.  This place is great for people who are familiar with Colombian or Salvadorian food, or want to try something new!"}
{"text":"A close friend treated me to dinner at this restaurant for my fortieth birthday. He said it was authentic Latin American cuisine. He should know, he's from Uruguay. I had a pleasant meal. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Final had a chance to try this place and it was fantastic. Everything was great and my girlfriend loved the tostones especially. Definitely a fan and will return in the future. If you have not tried here yet, put it on your list as a place to eat."}
{"text":"A hidden gem. This place has friendly service and great food. I started with tostones with guacamole which were delicious. I had an arepa with shrimp and it arrived steaming hot and fresh. The French fries served with it were also great.  I hope to return in the near future."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Actually found this place by mistake the first time we came here. Now it is a place we come to regularly and would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness! If this place gets discovered by more people, they would have a line out the door and down the street! This food is like being on vacation in a tropical climate. All genuine and authentic. We are definitely always looking for unique food and flavors and they make every little simple thing so perfect and fresh that your tastebuds will sing! We will definitely be making this a regular place to go!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret around.  The food is delicious and authentic.  Prompt, courteous and friendly service.  Good drinks, great value.  Makes you feel like you are on vacation!  We will return over and over again.  Very nice dining experience.  Try the Pupusas loca.  Yum!"}
{"text":"The Long and Short of it: The Pupusas are way too rigid with a hard texture, the curtido was extremely dry, the yuca con Chicharron was not what I was used to: the Chicharron was cubed and deeply fried vs. a generous piece of chicharron, fried enough to still pull apart by hand and remain juicy. Being transplants from Southern California,  my wife and I know the standard of great Pupuserias. We were greatly disappointed here. One star because they did have \"Pilsener\" (beer from El Salvador)."}
{"text":"This place is so damn good. The pupusas were off the chain delicious. We are from Seattle and so we don't get to go here until we visit family again but I wish it was close to where we live - I would be there all the time."}
{"text":"Hilariously unassuming location given how absolutely delicious the food is. Don't overlook this little family run establishment! Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is great! We tried the pupusas, the beef soup, el sabrozon. All of the plates were excellent, and pretty good size too. The service was also excellent, very prompt. The horchata and tamarindo juices were delicious as well. Usually we only come to this city for my kids hockey games, but now we have another reason to stop. Great combination of excellent food and service."}
{"text":"Don't know much about Columbian cuisine but food was delicious and service was friendly and fast. Very simple and enjoyable."}
{"text":"Probably the best restaurant in Fairview Park. The staff are great and the food is absolutely fantastic. I recommend this place to anyone who might be in the area. You will be so happy you stopped to eat here!"}
{"text":"After reading so many favorable reviews, I was excited to try the Bandeja Paisa, and I did.  Folks, it's perfectly fine, but nothing extraordinary.  Components of this dish are plain--a fried egg, a slice of avocado, a plantain, an aptly named \"plain arepa,\" etc. The more novel foods that came with my meal, like sausage, were solid, but not something I will likely crave in the future. This dish is fun, arriving with so many foods to try, and clearly freshly made (with a corresponding wait).  Our waitress was pleasant, helpful, and attentive.  I would visit again, maybe for lunch, just to try a papusas or specialty arepa, but I would go there with modest expectations."}
{"text":"It was by far the most uninspiring meal I have had that is supposed to be representative of South American cuisine. They had mozzarella cheese in the arepas.... It felt like I was eating at Pizza Hut. The cerviche felt like it had been pickling in the lemon juice for a few days. I love South American ( Columbian, Venezuela cuisine ) and have been to some excellent places in both the east and west coast. I fail to understand how this place has the rating it does on yelp"}
{"text":"Love this place, and I come here all the time. I have only ever done pick up orders. It's small, but they have a private lot, and looks like there is ample seating. The service has always been fast and friendly, and the prices are more than reasonable.  The empanadas are delicious. Not what I was expecting, but stuffed full with a chewy outer corn shell. Make sure to use the chunky salsa they come with. I had the cheese.   The arepas with beans and cheese are delicious as well. The arepas come with 2 different sauces, one sweeter and one spicy with a tang. I like the spicy one. I could probably even eat the corn shell without the filling, but I am weird. They also come with a side of fries, which are cooked to perfection. Long and firm, crispy on the outside, just how I like them.   The star of this place is the pupusas. My favorite are the bean and cheese. I like to drown them in tomato sauce and cabbage slaw.  I recently tried the steak tacos they offer as a side, and those are delicious as well. They are simple, with 2 small corn tortillas enrobing the meat. They come with a side of chopped onions, cilantro, and lime on the side. Nothing fancy, but they really hit the spot as a side or an appetizer.   The accompaniments really make the food here, and I know I will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Went with a friend.  She got the meat platter and loved it.  She said the food made her happy!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant, service was good, but food was lacking taste. I tried the Bandeja paisa, and some empanadas. Wont be coming back :("}
{"text":"My wife are always looking for something new and different so we gave this a try and were extremely impressed.  Great comfort food in a low key setting. Not being familiar with the various dishes offered, we asked for suggestions from the very friendly staff. The pupusas we had! chic hadron and con loroco were unusual but awesome.  We also added the pork empanadas.....excellent and complimented well everything else. Our main courses were then the tostados de piñata no con chorizo and the tilapia.  The platter was very good and offered numerous items and was more than filling.  The tilapia was very tasty and well prepared. All in all a worth while visit for great prices.  We will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"This winter when visiting my parents who live in my hometown we stopped here and were very impressed. We've lived in Houston Texas for the last 5 years and have come to know authentic delicious Latin American food. This place would be right up there with the best. Very friendly and quick service. Extra points for being paleo friendly as they offer their arepas served inside plantain and corn tortillas. I'll make sure to stop by each time I'm home, probably multiple times."}
{"text":"Delicious. I always forget about this place. Glad I remembered before going with the usual fare. Arepas with chorizo and tostones today!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! This place would do well in Ohio city or Tremont...I can't believe it's tucked away in fairview park! The empanadas and pupusas are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Delicious! The waiter was great, and told us they are working on a liquor license. Half the clientele was speaking Spanish, which is always a really good sign. We'll be back for sure. I had chicken arepas, and my boyfriend had bandeja paisa. His was so amazing. We scarfed everything down along with a delicious, flaky empanada. The pico that came with the empanada was absolutely amazing. Yum! i thought this was way better than Barroco Grill, which seems generic after eating here."}
{"text":"Probably going to spell it wrong , but their arepas ? are absolutely delicious . Just how I like them , crunchy and  sloppy ."}
{"text":"After reading such great reviews we decided to check it out for my birthday dinner. This place did not disappoint. The food was hot, fresh and delicious. I ordered the Mojarra Frita ( fried whole fish) it was amazing. I'm Haitian so this is reminded me of my mothers cooking and it did not disappoint. My fiancé and I will deff be back again.   Only tip is possibly turn up the heat. It was 14 degrees out in everyone had their coat on due to the draft coming in through the windows and door."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. We've been here many times. It's a hole in the wall. It's a mom & pop family business. They're focused on creating great food, and that they do!"}
{"text":"Our first time here.  Service was fast and friendly.  The food was amazing!  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent experience. The pork empanadas are the best I've ever had - delightfully crisp outer shell giving way to a delicate, almost creamy filling of potato and pork. I should have come hungrier so I could finish the beef arepa, served with both chipotle and garlic sauces. This was my first visit, but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and needed some tasty lunch. Yelp reviewers said this place has some good food and so we went. AWESOME flavorful food at a good price. Customer service was on point too. Great place :)"}
{"text":"So amazing!! Didn't know where to begin. Everything is fresh and delicious. I loved the seafood arepe and the margaritas are fantastic. Great food, great atmosphere. Will come back many times."}
{"text":"If you want an out of Cleveland experience with exotic flavors you can't find for hundreds of miles, this is a must try."}
{"text":"This place was so delicious! The cheese papusa was awesome, and the chorizo and the chicken arepas were tasty too. The fried plantains were o addictive...and those sauces, wow! We would definitely come back the next time we're on the west side!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for a quick, inexpensive lunch. Although I wish the Arepas came with plantains or beans instead of fries, they are still delicious!  I like mine filled with eggs and veggies and doused in the red and green avocado based sauce. The pupusas are also pretty good and don't let the price fool you, pretty filling in my book.  Nice change up from a regular sandwich or wrap."}
{"text":"The horchata was too sweet. I had the pollo arepa, and it was way too salty and greasy. The sauces were nice. I'm still waiting for a Venezuelan arepa joint to open around here, much better than Colombian."}
{"text":"I went here with my sons and we absolutely enjoyed it! The service was good and the people were friendly and helpful explaining the menu items. The steak tacos were delicious!!"}
{"text":"If you come and get just the cheese empanada and cheesy corn, you won't be disappointed. But don't forget about the wonderful arepas (I had the arepa con pollo) with two sauces to choose from. I had an issue not just drinking green garlic sauce from the bottle. My girlfriend had the black bean and cheese papusa which she devoured. The tomato sauce (salsa?) that came with the papusas I could honestly eat on any of the food, and by the spoonful. The service was great, attentive and helpful with any questions. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Terrific small place.  Loved the tasty sandwiches (Arepas) and the zucchini Pupusas! Not fancy."}
{"text":"I was super happy to stumble upon a new Salvadoran restaurant in Cleveland. I saw this place on my way to another restaurant and google could not find any reviews for it.   Me and my wife still went and had an awesome dinner there. The lady who was waiting on all the tables was very friendly and mentioned the restaurant is very new. I took a couple of photos and added it to Yelp.  I can't comment on the authenticity of the Colombian food, but I can tell you their Salvadoran food is amazing!   I recommend ordering some Pupusas. They are $2 each but they are big. We ordered cheese & loroco and  revueltas (mixed pork and cheese) and they were both delicious.  Don't ignore the slaw and tomato sauce! Curtido (the vinegary spicy slaw) and the red tomato sauce is meant for your Pupusas. Some people prefer to put some on top of their pupusa as they eat it while others just have it on the side.  Loroco is a green herb that makes the cheese pupusas perfect. I remember my older brother hated loroco when he was a kid, so if you're with someone who is picky you might want let them stick with straight up cheese pupusas.  We also ordered some Atol de Elote, which is a hot sweet creamy corn drink that is also has cinnamon in it. It was spectacular and tasted just like I remember. They served it in a bowl like a soup, but I asked if I could put it in a mug because I'm used to drinking it like a hot chocolate after dinner.  We also tried their Colombian Empanadas which were outstanding with the cilantro and tomato salsa that it comes with.  The atmosphere of the place is very similar to any small hispanic restaurant: few tables, loud music, and a TV with a soccer game on. If you are familiar with this kind of restaurant then you know you are mostly coming for the delicious food served by a friendly staff. Compared to the other two Salvadoran restaurants in Cleveland this restaurant has a much more welcoming ambiance.  I can't wait to go back and have some fried plantains and other Salvadoran staples!"}
{"text":"Tasty, solid food here. Can't speak to the authenticity of it, but I found it to be a welcome change of flavors from your average American fare.   I got the steak Arepa with fries and an Orchata. Orchata was very good with just the right amount of cinnamon. The arepa was stuffed with veggies and meat, all held together by a toasted corn pocketed flatbread. I topped the arepa with each of the sauces they give you, which are fantastic! The only thing I was sad about was the fact that I had forgotten to order the plantains in place of the fries. Something to look forward to next time."}
{"text":"I thought the oil they fried everything in destroyed the taste of the fresher ingredients they made the food in.  It seems like it didn't take long for them to start substituting with cheaper ingredients.  If they have used the same oil all this time then I would say the other ratings were done by people who don't cook or by the owners themselves.  I would pay more for better food but not for food I have a hard time swallowing."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat on the west side of Cleveland. The food is spectacular and the fact that it is BYOB only makes it better. The tostones with guac is my favorite. Arepas are great and I haven't had a bad meal yet. So affordable and a great menu."}
{"text":"The arepas here are just AWESOME! I eat here in this small family restaurant every time I come to town. The food is home cooked and original."}
{"text":"Place is awesome. The pupupas are amazing. This is a hidden gem. You cannot go wrong with an Arepa sandwich. Equally incredible. Great eats here."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews and loving latin food me and my wife decided to give it a try and it did not disappoint. The prices were very reasonable and we both left very full with plenty to bring home. i will def be back to eat here again."}
{"text":"What a great find in Fairview Park, Ohio! They food is delicious and the service excellent. The restaurant is small, with parking in the back. It's nice to have this food available in the suburbs, so we don't have to go into Cleveland for this type of food."}
{"text":"Super excited this restaurant is right up the road from me! Have been there quite a few times since it's opened, trying a verity of different menu options, everything excellent! The rice and beans that come with most of the dishes are incredible and the service and ambiance is exceptional. Happy to have this little gem in Fairview Park! Highly highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!!! Arepa con chorizo fresh, hot and super tasty.  The provided sauces rocked. The sevice was excellent. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very very tasty, reasonably priced and not overly greasy.  Got the chicken arepa, a pupusa, one of the specials and a flan and everything was great. The pupusas are these beautiful stuffed flat breads if you've never had them before. I liked it way better than the other Columbian restaurant in Cleveland and I'll be going back."}
{"text":"Having never had El Salvadorian food prior to coming here I am now a convert. So much so that I am pretty sure I met god on one of my visits here and her name is Pupusa. For those who don't know what a Pupusa is it's like a pillowy, soft, corn tortilla with a savory filling inside that comes with pickled slaw and a vinegary hot sauce. Everytime I come I have to get the black bean Pupusas with avocado and every time without fail they are super warm, fresh, and flavorful. The menu also includes Arepas and other Latin American fare and is quite extensive. For what this location lacks in decor it makes up for in delicious food with no pretense and excellent service."}
{"text":"4 1/2 stars thru 110 reviews cant be wrong and they certainly were not. I got the arepas carne, and chicken tamale, and my lady friend got 3 beef empanadas. The food took a bit longer than what one would expect but it was definitely worth the wait. You could tell everything was made to order just by how hot everything was when it came out. My arepa stayed hot all the way thru me eating it as did the empanadas. The flavor in my steak arepa was beyond description. Imagine the best philly cheesesteak you ever had and multiply that by 1000. The tamale was also very good. They bring it out to you still wrapped in the banana leaf. The texture was different than a mexican tamale in that is was softer and the best way i can put it without making it sound offputting is mushy, but it was still delicious. I will definitely be coming back until I have tried everything, thats for damn sure. The prices are also really low given the quality and authenticity of the food."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations. Very flavorful. Service a tad slow but not bad. Would return. Arepas very great"}
{"text":"Very authentic and yummy. We tried empanadas, pupusas and Arepa with chorizo and stake. All of them were delicious. I am definitely gonna go back and try tacos and other stuff.  I also must add that this place is very clean and smells good. Definitely worth the long drive."}
{"text":"The servers are very friendly and attentive, even though the place was packed on Sunday afternoon. The food is DELICIOUS and at the right price. We had a lot of things. The arepa de pollo was very flavorful and with lots of ingredients that enhanced the very generous portion of chicken inside it. Yuca frita is very good with a tender inside and freshly fried. I am definitely going back for more... next time I will try to the steak arepas. Awesome experience. I wish they were closer to downtown... the west side always gets the best food (jealous)."}
{"text":"Just found this place the other day.  It's great!  A real hidden gem.  I wish I could remember the names of the entrees I got, they were both great.  One from the Columbian side of the menu:  chicken in a corn tortilla thing with a great sauce.  Came with fries.  The other was this potato / chicken delicous thing all cooked together.  We got those plus 2 pupusa's (one of my new favorite foods), all for $21.  Great deal, great food."}
{"text":"Pros: - service was friendly and attentive  - the food (especially the fried plantains) was DAMN good  - food is clearly authentic - the ambiance is ticky tacky in a good way  - proximity to great northern shopping area  Cons: - food and drinks were just a tad overpriced.  When I go to a little neighborhood spot with paper napkins I hope to at least not be paying $15-20 a head for lunch.  $10-15 would be more reasonable, I think.   Go here for: Lunch/ a break from Chipotle or Panera"}
{"text":"This place was a surprise find. Probably driven by it thousand times..... Did not notice until this past weekend. Not much to say about the ambience of decor. It is a very homely place. Service was good, prompt and friendly. Since this was out first time eating at a pupusa restaurant, we got three items from the menu to be able to sample a variety.  I loved the pupusa. Corn based bread tasted awesome. The sauce it came with was also very good - mild but tasty. Fried yuca was a novelty for us. I liked it.... But would not order again unless there are 4-5 pl in my group. It is a large portion and the fried greasy-ness can get overwhelming (at least for me). Good item to share. The potato empanada was also good. I will go again to try the arepa and few other items that interested me on the menu. And of course, you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on my mother's whim a while back and oh my goodness it is so good. I just keep coming back.   The food is all prepared very well and with a lot of care. I've so far tried a decent portion of the menu, but my favorites are the cheese empanadas, the pupusas (can't choose a favorite!), the atole, and of course, the fried plantains. But really, everything here is worth getting.  The service is great and the prices are good for the portions and quality. Only downside is no liquor license, but the selection of drinks and the delicious coffee make up for it. Definitely try it out."}
{"text":"When you choose 5 stars it says \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" well that explains this place exactly!   My boyfriend and I recently came here because we heard how amazing it was (he has even been back for take-out orders) and all the reviews were spot on! I can see ourselves becoming regulars.  The Arepas were light and not too heavy so you can focus on all the other ingredients that are stuffed into these beautiful hand crafted piles of deliciousness. The Pupusas are large and you get 3 per order. The two of us each had one and we were almost full! The filling is so simple and executed phenomenally. The one thing that stood out to me the most and I get a daily craving for are the plantains! The caramelization on these succulent gems just melt in your mouth. I almost cannot explain the brilliance behind these.   I also may have purchased a bottle of the garlic sauce (chimichurri) because you can buy any of their sauces.  *Apologies for all the buzz words to describe this delicious place."}
{"text":"Very gracious server with a sense of humor. My middle son spilled three glasses of water and we moved tables twice.  Papusas were fantastic! I prefer a spicier cabbage slaw but they had hot sauce you could add.  Arepas were delectable. A first taste for us. Columbian sausage (chorizo) was a link accompanying our arepa and it was delicious. Smoky , crispy outside and tender, juicy inside. Don't have anything to compare them to.  Tamales were a bit heavy and not quite as sweet as others I've had from El Salvador. The sour cream was American style and not my favorite. The beans however were a taste of heaven in your mouth.  All three of our boys ages 12, 15 and 16 loved the food. Would be appropriate for much younger kids because it is not extremely spicy.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding flavors, well executed.  I lived in Venezuela when I was young, and the food here is highly authentic."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here the other night. The place was super affordable, BYOB and friendly service, so where's the line out the door? I had ordered a bunch of food to try and I didn't meet an item I didn't like.   To start I did the chicken, pork and cheese empanadas. I loved them all, especially with the house pico they are served with. The cheese was my favorite, then the pork was probably my second favorite and so on. For our entrees, we did the bandeja paisa and carne asada. The bandeja is like a sampler in my opinion, due to all the different items that come on the plate. Rice, beans, plantains, over medium egg, avocado, chicharrones (pork skin and meat deep fried, extra crispy), Colombian sausage (kinda like chorizo) and even though it's not listed on the menu it even had a thin piece of steak. What a value and every thing on this dish was really yummy. The chicharrone was the best I ever had, I even ordered another one a la cart. The carne asada was a steak cooked medium, I added egg, rice, beans and avocado. The steak is on the thinner side, but was still cooked medium in certain areas. It was seasoned very well and I did enjoy it.  I cannot wait to go back and try the pupusas and the arepas. This place is a real gem, and there was plenty of parking when I was there. I can't wait to go back with my semi frozen six pack of beers."}
{"text":"I haven't had access to a home made Pupusas in years and this place did not disappoint! I also loved the fried yucca appetizer with their garlic sauce. My daughter loved their carne asada and my dad loved his steak quesadilla fajita and my dad's wife loved a little bit of everything along with their coleslaw type of salad. The prices are very reasonable and the staff are pleasant. I'm definitely coming here again, soon :)"}
{"text":"Great blend of cuisines. Whole fish here is prepared perfectly and fresh tasting with avocado salad. Recommend the tilapia shrimp ceviche"}
{"text":"Moving this up to a 5-star review...food is just too good not to.  Finally brought my wife here recently and she was blown away by the food quality and choices available.  We sampled two different kinds of arepas (one chicken and one chorizo), a bean and cheese pupusa and shared a flan for dessert.  Everything was off the charts delicious and I swear I'd drink both their sauces if I could.  A fantastic meal every time I've been there."}
{"text":"Unreal. Service was friendly and helpful, the food was fresh and excellent. We tried a little of everything on the menu and were thoroughly impressed. You could taste the love and pride that went into making our meal and that's what we look for in a restaurant. Highly recommend and will be bringing our out of town visitors."}
{"text":"Pure perfection. A hidden gem . Nothing else needs to be said I never give 5 stars but this place is that good . The service is great , the staff is pleasant and helpful , the menu is simple and delicious."}
{"text":"Everything is so so delicious here!! My first time stopping in tonight and I already want to take everyone I know here.  The empanadasss are so yummy!  The pupusas are perfect! Tamale was excellent! And this may be a very small detail but they have the best Pico de gallo I've ever had.  The two gentlemen working tonight were so incredibly sweet and welcoming.  Can't wait to come back and try more things!"}
{"text":"Just simply the best. Pupusas? Perfect. And so cheap! Tostones? Perfect. Arepas? Phenomenal. Cheesy corn? Duh. Casamiento lunch combo is my go-to, lunch or not. Eggs, rice and veggies, and a plantain. Seasoned just right.  Next time I go, I'm getting that entire fish. Saw a guy eat it the other day and he loved it.   And the Dr Pepper is always top notch."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much.  I know people always say that but damn, it's so true.  We wanted a taste of something different and Cleveland and so we decided to come here.  How could you not order the Bandeja Paisa? The photos of it are amazing! Colombian sausage, steak, beans, plaintain, egg, avocado and don't forget the big ass chicharron strip that will leave you wanting more.  Uggh, I was frustrated when I saw the actual plate arrive at my table.  Everything was tiny.  The avocado was a thin slice, the sausage and plantain was the size of my pinkie but by far the MOST disappointing was the chicharron.  I'm looking at all of these pics that people are posting and what they get is something that is the size of my arm.  When my plate came out I literally thought the waiter forgot the pork skin and was going back to the kitchen to get it until I looked closer at my plate.  It was no joke, maybe 2 inches max and super thin (that's what she said). By the time I gave a piece to my bf, I had maybe two bites left.  That's why I got the dish in the first plate; because I'm a crispy pork skin whore.  Yes, everything tasted good.  I'll give them that.  But I felt cheated.  I did.  Just a heads up the \"steak\" was more like cube steak and not like a ribeye or anything. It had a super familiar taste to it like the McDonald's secret burger sauce.  Try it and argue with me!  I don't know if they just didn't think I could throw down and eat all of my food or if they just really decided to cut back lately, but I was pretty disappointed that I didn't get the same experience as everyone else."}
{"text":"Stopped here today to use my entertainment book coupon.  I'm so glad we came here.  The food was wonderful, everything was so tasty.  I pretty much hate any type of bean ( the one can I bought almost 10 years ago is still in my basement), but I loved their beans and ate all of them.  I can't remember the name of the dish I got, but it had a tiny piece of Columbian Sausage (which is to die for) a small skinny, chewy piece of steak (that is poor quality but extremely full of flavor) a fried egg, avocado, the beans, fried pork belly (even yummier if dipped in their garlic sauce) a quarter of a plantain (which I gobbled down and didn't share) and rice (along with those beans).  For an appetizer, a the pupusa locola (the flower one) was split.  I thougth the Salvadoran restaurant in Old Brooklyn was tasty, but this place blows it away.     My mom had a chicken dish that had onions and peppers in a corn pita type thing.  Her first bite and she exclaimed how delicious it was.  Then tried it with the garlic sauce and was blown away.  I tasted it and also thought it was quiet good.    The restaurant is tiny, with about four booths on one side of the ramping entrance and a few table and chairs sets on the other side.  It was clean and simply decorated with the flags of Columbia and El Salvador and other wood nick-knacks.   I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I went there today for lunch with my wife we had the empanadas, which were good but felt it needed more bite in the seasoning. The ceviche was fresh and acidic as it should be the sauces that came with it a chipotle and the other was like a garlic and cilantro aioli which was delicious. The ambience was very Latin with the Laliga football (soccer) match and the music was at about an 8.  We are planning on going back to try a dish called Picada Columbiana and Seafood arepas. Ran into some friends who known in the Cleveland food scene and this one of their little place they like to go."}
{"text":"I really can't compare this to other Columbian/Salvadorian restaurants because this is the only one I've ever been to.  What I can say is that every time I've gone I was glad I went.  Every time we've eaten there the food was top notch.    What I can't get over is how inexpensive the place is.  For what you would spend on junk food at a drive through you can get high quality, incredibly good tasting food here.  Honestly, if you're low on funds, it's probably cheaper to eat here than to go grocery shopping.  And even with that, it doesn't taste like \"cheap food\".  Excellent! Excellent! Excellent!  I need a 6th star to accurately rate this place."}
{"text":"Very disappointed on our last visit.  Seem to be using the same bread for pupusas and arepas.  Cheesy corn was thin and runny.  Prices have been raised beyond quality of food and experience.  Likely will go to Barroco next time we're in the mood for Colombian food."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp! Out shopping with my wife and looking for some place to eat that was different and boy did we find it! The plantains were perfect, not dry like a lot of places. We had Arepas with veggies and cammorones. The fat Columbian tortillas were delicious and the fillings were awesome. We will bring our Columbian sister-in-law next time she is in town. Muy Bueno."}
{"text":"The food was delicious, not too many pupuserias in the CLE area but this place by far the best! Ahuevo"}
{"text":"Excellent tasting food. My fiancé and I split two entrees which we both loved and had a cheese appetizer which I don't remember what is was called, but it was delicious."}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem. Love the pupusas, especially laroco (spelling?) and the slaw for the top. We get take out all the time although I love eating there. Never busy which I don't get. You can get a feast for about $10."}
{"text":"Great food! We always order and eat too much. 3/ cheese empanadas, a pupusa loco, and a chorizo arepa. The portions are large, so we usually have leftovers. Get a flan to go as well."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic. I recommend the chorizo arepa. My only small complaint is that the prices have steadily increased since opening. But I will continue to pay for delicious authentic cuisine."}
{"text":"El Arepazo y Pupuseria was a great find for a quick meal before departing from Cleveland Airport on my one day business trip. Had the arepa con chorizo and a pupusa. I've had better pupusas in the SF Bay Area (where it's hard to find any arepa options) and better arepas in Miami but considering I was in Cleveland, I was pleasantly surprised they were both offered at all. I'd say the arepas were much better than the pupusas here. One arepa was quite filling and had quite a bit of ingredients but the maize flatbread was a bit thicker than I'm used to."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this restaurant.  Loved the tamarind drink, then papusas and the platters of food we got.  Didn't really like the warm corn dessert or the banana candy, but of the savory foods we got, we liked everything.  Prices are very reasonable and the waitstaff was polite and helpful.  Will be back."}
{"text":"This place is just freagin' awesome! The scaled down atmosphere simply made me appreciate the authenticity of my meal. I went here with my boyfriend who never tasted Colombian or Salvadorian cuisine and he was so impressed. We like our food spicy...well, hot as haydes (ie...a fire hydrant needs to be near by), but the sauces, which were all amazing didn't have that kick. That's the only thing I would ask of them is to please make me up a batch of the hottest habeneros sauce you have. We had the chicken arepas, papusa and the steak entrée...we shared. YUMMY! Fries...super YUM. Everything was good...well seasoned and they don't  skimp on the portions. We were the last ones in the restaurant and we never felt rushed. Totally would be back again."}
{"text":"Went with my husband and teens to try something new. We ordered a smorgasbord of items to share. There was nothing we wouldn't order again! Very positive for a family that doesn't have Colombian food very often. Chicken tamale was my favorite. We left very satisfied after paying a quite reasonable bill. Recommend and will return."}
{"text":"This was great! We took a friend from El Salvador and he said that the papusas were 10/10 like at home. I liked the reveultas, bean and cheese, and cheese better than the chicken. 2 is a good serving size unless you are very hungry."}
{"text":"This is truly a hidden gem.  The building is tucked into a busy street - it's easy to pass over, but it is well worth the stop.  The decor is average - but you are coming here for the food, not the \"experience\".  I LOVED the pupusas - it was my first venture into this stuffed corn tortilla of bliss.  I love both the queso, and the queso con loroco (an edible flower from a Salvadorian vine).  At 1.99 - you can't go wrong.  Also, look for their chicken soup... this is like no soup you have had before.  A friend had to clue me into ordering this, otherwise I would have never chosen it.  Out comes a huge bowl of broth with corn, a starchy vegetable (maybe yuca), and carrot.  On the side was a beautifully seasoned half of a grilled chicken.  As I disassembled the chicken and added it to the soup with the rice - I was amazed by how incredible it was.  It seems like they have this soup every other weekend - it alternates with the beef soup, which is not nearly as good.  The arepas are great, the sausage is also excellent.  The only thing left to be desired is their frozen bland french fries they serve with many items - skip these!  They will happily trade them out for plantains!"}
{"text":"So delicious and authentic.   The food is fresh and flavorful.   Bring your own alcohol!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, we knew we had to try this place last week. The service was great, the margarita was excellent and the pupusas were OUT OF THIS WORLD. the cheese one was like a commercial with the pull apart cheese. Unbelievable. Also loved all of the sauces they put on the table. We're headed back for lunch soon!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a fantastic meal here.  We tried a variety of items.  The Tostada de Ceviche was fantastic.  We also tried the Pupusas, Arepas and Empanadas and everything was delicious.  This is a real gem with a menu that is different than the typical Cleveland fare.  We plan on being regulars."}
{"text":"This is quite the gem and I found this place near my parent's house on the west side.  I never expected something quite this delicious to be found near in the suburbs.  Bare in mind this review has been long awaited and my last visit was over a month ago.  The El Salvadorian delight is quaint with a slightly divey appeal to it, which typically will tell it- it's good and run by true El Salvadorians.  The TV will play Telemundo on in the background with Spanish soap operas running. The service was fairly good, but slightly hindered by the English barrier.  It's much easier to just point to the item on the menu than try to tell them what you want (unless you speak decent Spanish, but I'm a Frenchie).  The papusas were on the spot with the right of amount of filing and thickness like a delicious papusa should.  The pork, cheese and beans hit the spot.  The empandas were delicious.  I ordered 2 more after the first fried little delight.  The papusas and empandas are AMAZING WITH THEIR SALSA, SPICY CABBAGE SLAW AND DIPPING SAUCE.  I got extra sides of all three, it was soo soo good with them both.    For entrees we got the Bandeja Paisa (Chorizo, Chicharrones, Rice/ Beans, Plantains, a Fried Egg and Avocado).  The Bandeja Paisa was really delicious and the rice/beans were fairly delish (seasoned and creamy)!  The fried plantains added a nice light sweetness to it.  The Chorizo provided the savory and spicy protein.  I was a bit disappointed with the chicharrones (fried pork belly)- the pork belly was a little hairy for my taste and the it was very chewy and overdone.  It was unfortunate since I love fried pork belly.    We also got the Carne Asada Steak, which was decent, not the best we ever had.  I found the beef to be slightly bland and chewy.  The flavor is there, it just needs a touch more seasoning.  It came with plantains, lettuce, rice and beans.  Lastly, we got my favorite thing of the night, fried fish.  It was a FRIED WHOLE FISH, bone and all.  It was crispy light fried smelts and nice amount of salty with a mix of moist and flaky fish meat.  The limes they provided help cut some of the heaviness to the fish and rounded it out nicely.  The fish was super fresh and oh so tasty  The menu is moderately priced and definitely worth a drive / try, especially the empandas and papusas!!"}
{"text":"Expensive Food with mediocre taste to the best. Between 6 people spend $150( no drinks). Should have gone somewhere else"}
{"text":"The Pupusas and Tamale is on point. I travel a bit and am always on the hunt for special eateries. This is the only memorable dining I've had in Cleveland. That Arepas garlic sauce is outstanding."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  The empanadas and pupusas were fantastic!  I plan on trying everything on the menu!  Next time you are driving on Lorain Road don't pass this place up!  It is a must try!"}
{"text":"I love different kinds of food. I had heard rave reviews from friends (Thank you Andy,) about this little place, and I'm really glad that Patty and I got a chance to stop off.  The restaurant is very intimate, I'd say only seating maybe 25 at the most, but if I had to, I'd stand to eat the great foods here!  The arepas, empenadas and other fare are fresh, delicious and simply presented, with good prices and good service. My wife and I were really impressed. I have to say, I'm going to go back MANY more times just to try to sample the whole menu. They also have a small bar with mostly beer and limited wine selection, but still very satisfying.   So, if you looking for a little place with BIG FLAVOR, try out El Arepazo, and give your taste buds a treat:)"}
{"text":"We had a late lunch there on Saturday. about a 30 min wait but not bad. Room at the bar for a couple of margarita's. Bartender transferred the bill so that was nice. Great options to build your own or select their special. Great service and the tacos were awesome. Get the guac with the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar on a recent Friday night.  Good selection of beers and tequila.    I wanted to try a little bit of everything so I started with a cheese empanada.  It was nice and crispy but frankly didn't have much flavor.  Not sure what I expected but the cheese was really bland.  I'd recommend getting some tasty stuff inside.   Also tried a pupusa filled with beans, cheese and loroco flower.  Loroco is similar to spinach I suppose.  I can best describe the pupusa as a type of quesadilla that isn't as cheesy.  Was tasty and very large.  Plenty of leftovers.   The star was the arepa. Forgot what I got in it but it was the first one on the menu (loco?).  Not me, the arepa.  This by itself is a meal and I barely ate half after loading up on the other goodies.    Overall very good. Nice find.  I wasn't sure what Pupuseria really stood for but considering where I'm typing this from (3rd \"visit\") I think I have a good idea."}
{"text":"Great, authentic, cozy, quaint and unsuspecting restaurant. One of the best Latin places I've been in Cleveland. Columbian and Salvadorian food."}
{"text":"It has really good service, but basically everything is the same. The sauces are great though. Have had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant.  I was very disappointed.  I had a platter that different meats.  They had one piece of meat that was some sort of hard pork.  It looked like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle.  It looked and tasted disgusting.  The other part of the meal was just so so.  It was not that busy and the staff could have been more friendly.  The decor of the place, very plain could have been better.  Looked like they did not have enough money for decorating."}
{"text":"Having lived in Venezuela for some time, and since I am constantly making arepas regularly at home, I have been hesitant stopping by this gem.  Boy am I glad I did!!   Although in my opinion, the curtido could use a little more heat to it, the food was out of this world.  Everything from the rice and beans, to the empanadas, to the pupusas, to the arepas con tostones are awesome.   We even got a chorizo taco, and were very happy we did.  If you are in the area, hell, even if you aren't, swing by and give this place a try.  The staff is super friendly, and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"I had a very delicious Pupusas Loca:  pork, cheese, beans and loroco flower.  And a pupusas de Ayote:  zucchini and cheese...there's nothing to say but it was yummylicious."}
{"text":"This is the spot! Willie was on point quick with service and the food was excellent, went there with two friends and everyone was stuffed and I think we paid $15 each. I had the ceviche and the Colombian sausage. Perfect. Place was very small and for an average height guy at 6' the booth was a little tight but I'm just glad we got a seat."}
{"text":"I've never had Columbian and Salvadorian food before my visit here, but my tastebuds know what they like and they REALLY liked the food I was shoving in there!  I had a pork papusa to start with, and it was served with some sort of orangish colored sauce and what I can only incorrectly describe as a spicy creamless coleslaw hybrid.  Simply put - AWESOME.  The masa was flavorful and tender, but griddled to a crisp perfection.  The pork wasn't the star in this dish for me, but was good none-the-less.  The masa is what really left me wanting more.  I also had an arepa.  I can't really remember which one I had, but it was loaded with meat, peppers, onions, and stuffed into a corn based dough.  The dish comes with a side of fries - whatever.  It was served with a mayo/salsa thing.  I'm not sure if I really liked it, but I know I didn't not like it.  What crossed my mind as I walked out the door after eating my meal was, \"I don't know what the hell I just ate, but I loved it and I'll be back.\""}
{"text":"After a long time of this restaurant being on my unofficial bucket list of places I needed to try, I met my boyfriend up here for a quick lunch. As he has already been to actual Colombia (a f'ing blew that potential trip because I dragged my feet on getting my passport), he is a little bit more of a connoisseur on Colombian cuisine. He ordered the \"farmer's breakfast\" which I forgot the actual name of the dish (see picture), and I thought it was delicious and big. I ordered some kind of loaded pupusa and it was cheesey, rich, flavorful, and delicious. The plantains were a little bigger than I'm used to (hehe) so when they were fried in big chunks which left the insides starchy and a bit tough. The horchata was very sweet and tasted more like a juice than the traditional, creamy, spiced drink that I'm used to. The interior is a little odd, and I think needs some changing (think random pops of color and very cheap furniture). I will be back to try the fish and some of the other flavorful, traditional dishes they have there.   Now I'm obsessed with calling people I love \"little pupusas\". Sounds like an insult, but it's actually adorable and it rolls off the tongue! Hehe..."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this wonderful little jewel of a restaurant!   We tried little bits of everything. Luckily, the daughter knows the owners.   Everything was wonderful and I can't wait to go again.   Almost couldn't finish my lunch, as it was so filling. I had the arepa con loca. Pictured here. OMG. I was so conflicted! I COULD NOT STAND LEAVING IT BEHIND.   And they have these incredible sauces to accompany the food. One is a garlic concoction, and the other is a chipotle mix. Pick a favorite? Impossible.  The place is low key, and tiny. Blink, and you'll drive by.  Cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with lots of vegetarian options available.  But every single thing I ate needed salt.  Still, authentic Latin American food is a good thing to have in Fairview Park. The staff was incredibly friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  This place, while the size of a large closet, had GREAT food!!!!  The service is friendly. If you speak Spanish, the conversation is entertaining...but if you don't, they won't hold it against you.  Great little secret in Fairview Park!"}
{"text":"This place is great. My brother and I took a trip out to North Olmstead/Fairview Park for lunch on a Monday. This place is a combination of Colombian (arepazo) and Salvadorean (pupuseria) food!  We got a bunch of things to share and had plenty leftover. We had..  FOOD:  4 - Tamale - their tamale comes in a banana leaf. Amazing!! We shared this - make sure you put the tapatio sauce on. We liked it so much we ordered one to go. $3.99?  3.5 - Beef empanada - order comes with one. The shredded beef was fresh, and it came inside a crispy fried shell with some tomato salsa on the side. It was a little expensive for a small empanada - $2.25  5 - Arepa de Chorizo - my brother ordered this. It's a small Colombian street food sandwich. The flavors all melded together really well. I think the best part was the arepa shell - it was grilled perfectly. It comes with a side of fries, as well as with sauces. $8.99 (same quality and much less expensive than some *other* locations that get more press. I guess you don't have to pay for the \"trendiness\".)  4 - Pupusas - 1 cheese + bean and 1 cheese + bean + pork. I had the cheese + bean - the texture was a little too soft on the inside of the pupusa. The shredded cabbage could have used a little more flavor too. My brother tried the cheese + bean + pork and said that the pork added much more dimension, so we definitely suggest getting that one! The pupusas were pretty sizable. After all this food, we were really full. $1.99 each  SERVICE:  Really attentive service, really friendly too. Our waiter checked on us regularly and really wanted to make sure we had a good time, and we did. Very clean but basic interior (small tables + chairs and a few booths), good for small groups.  OVERALL:  The location is a little far for us, but if we are in the area I definitely will come back. Or make special trips. :)"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong! Very friendly and prompt service. The menu is extensive. Played it safe and ordered the Carne Asada with Colombian sausage. Yes! Fantastic little restaurant and bar."}
{"text":"This is a gem. I've lived in Cleveland my whole life and this is one of the best places I have eaten at in all of Cleveland.  Must try the Arepa and the Pupusas. Those are both 5 star dishes. Had the Tostones Fajitas too, which were great but I would give that dish about 4 stars. The Tostones(fried plantains) didnt have much flavor but was a good platform for the fajitas. Also the white creamy garlic sauce was phenomenal, I found myself pitting it on every bite.   Everyone must try this place at some point in their life!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! I'm always on the hunt for delicious pupusas and this place is the jackpot! I came in a little after the dinner rush and ordered take out--very fast and very friendly service. I had the bean and cheese pupusas and tried a choirzo taco--both were wonderful. I'll be ordering from here over and over again! Delicious food and the friendliest servers you'll ever meet!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  We had a mango margarita, an order of pupusas, and arepas with fries.  Everything was delicious!  Their creamy sauces would make a piece of cardboard taste good!  Service is friendly and efficient.  If you're tired of the same old food, try this place!"}
{"text":"amo este restaurante me recuerda mucho a mi hogar, Bogotá Colombia. Mi vida, todo lo que sé.  The inside is small but i like it that way. The food smelled amazing from the street so i took a quick u-turn and entered the world of colombian heaven.  The menu is simple and straight to the point, with some of the most authentic colombian food around. Papusas and arepas, rice and beans, omg my mouth watered while ordering. All the food is made to order and is prepared in a kitchen that is visible from the little bar they have set up. It takes a bit of time but its so worth it because the quality and authenticity of the food is not comparable! They are both spanish and english speaking, good for groups and families, and they take credit cards. They have a bar as well serving alcohol. Its very affordable and convenient, they have take out and order ahead available as well."}
{"text":"How glad am I that we live 5 minutes from this delightful place?! We can pop in for a quick bite whenever the craving strikes. The craving for cheese empanadas strikes often. These are not to be missed and they are larger than the 2 bites another reviewer complained about. Or perhaps I just take daintier bites out of a 2\" by 3\" crispy pillow of melty cheese.  On Saturday they make soup. Whatever it is, try it. My mom loves the beef and the chicken versions and she makes the best soup I've ever had, so that's high praise. The portions on everything are big enough to share, or to fill up a hungry teenage boy. Luckily for me, they always graciously box up my leftovers.  My best advice is to come often, try everything and enjoy. Use the condiments they give you to season things to your taste. That's the point. You have it your way. I have it my way. If you think something is bland, ask for some chipotle sauce. That'll perk it up.  This place feels like I'm eating at someone's home. Someone who's a really good cook and makes great flan."}
{"text":"Bad service. Good food. We ordered so and so, waitress didn't understand but she wrote down what I had told her and knew this because we got the slip she had written at the end of our meal. So instead of what we ordered we got somebody else's food. Another guy said that he wasn't going to charge us and we were still getting the food we ordered. He brings a check for the things we DIDNOT order. He first told us he was only going to charge for the things we ordered and we were still going to get them, then, so he lied twice. Then I told him this and he says he can't give us even one free meal for the food we got charged for that we didn't even originally ordered. Food was still good but was highly disappointed the guy lied and couldn't cover the mistake. Not good business and won't be returning because who knows what'll happen next time"}
{"text":"Oh my this place is amazing! I should have taken more pictures but it was so good I forgot. Anyhow everything we had there is already a picture of on here. But I did manage a picture of the sauces they give you with the arepa. The hubs got a chorizo arepa that looked so good I was jealous. I got a cheese pupusa which was way better than I thought it would be based on the pictures and description. Now I see what everyone is raving about. And the ceviche which was so fresh and served with their perfect pico. And an empanada which also came with pico. Ends up all three of these things together are about the same price as the arepa and I wanted to try more than just one thing so it worked out. They were all some of the best I have ever tasted. The service was excellent too."}
{"text":"I was looking for place to eat lunch , I call place my order and when I got there it was ready The place was so comfy that I stay there to eat !!! This place is awesome !!  El arepazo y pupuseria is the place !!!"}
{"text":"Holy moly! This food is big and it is filling! I knew I was going to bring leftovers home though, so I figured why not taste everything. We basically came and ordered all the arepas and papusas! I had the chorizo arepa and a pork papusa, a bean & cheese papusa, and loroco & cheese, plus a size of yuca fries. My favorite part of the meal were the fries and the thick tortillas. So delicious with a crispy outside and tender insides. The sauces were so bomb. I even liked the Cole slaw (which I usually hate). It was very strong in lime flavor and a little bit sweet; it also had a few jalepenos slices. The loroco is supposed to be similar to zucchini or broccolini I believe.  I didn't think it had too much flavor, but I am not opposed to a plain cheese one so that was ok.  My only complaint, (or note rather) is that my pork papusa was basically identical to the cheese and bean one. Delicious--But I expected shredded meat. It is entirely possible that I got two bean ones, but I asked the waiter and he said it was one of each. Anyway, I was going to bring the leftovers home for my husband but I think I will go start munching..."}
{"text":"It was just ok. We went with friends and shared empanadas, pupusas, arepas and my husband ordered the bandeja paisa. It was almost like eating at a friend's house - the pupusas and arepas came with what seemed to be ore-ida fries. The fillings were not as spicy or flavorful as I anticipated - I don't even like spices and I thought it was pretty bland. My husband thought his bandeja paisa was ok, nothing spectacular that one would think, \"wow, this is delicious\". I had read about the corn dessert drink, which came in a styrofoam cup. I took a few bites/drinks and asked for a lid to go. It was like a corn pudding (with whole corn) and cinnamon spices. It wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  The owner was friendy, gave us a free cup of a horchata type drink to take home."}
{"text":"Tamales tacos pupusas what more can a Californian ask for. Priced extremely well!!!! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see a new Pupusa place open in Cleveland.  I grew up in the DC area and there is a huge Salvadorian population and a lot of Pupusa places there.  I don't know if my expectations were too high, but I was sorely disappointed in El Arepazo Y Pupuseria.  First, there is absolutely no atmosphere.  I don't need anything fancy and I enjoy most dives, but the night we went (Sat. night) there was no music playing.  The booth we sat in was directly under the television which had on the news.  It is too brightly lit and the sparse decor is odd.    All that aside had the food been great, I wouldn't have cared a bit.  But the food was not great, not good even.  We ordered two pupusas revuelta, platanos fritos, two potato pies and two epandas carne.  The epenadas were fried hot on the outside but still slightly frozen in the middle, the pupusas are huge but these too were crispy on the outside and not cooked on the inside. I didn't care for the flavor profile of the curtido, nothing like I've had in the past.   I understand the need to make things ahead and keep them frozen..but when you can't bring them to a proper temperature, it's a problem.  The potato pies and the plantains were just okay.  We did not send our food back and we still ate it all.  We did not try any of the Arepas and based on this visit, we'll likely stick to Borroco grill for arepas.  For a $18..so you can't complain about the prices.  The other food looked good, other patrons seemed happy.  Maybe we hit an off night or time so I would consider trying it again if I am on that side of town...but I wouldn't make a special trip there."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I love Barroco Grill, but this spot is even better. It's pretty inexpensive, but the quality is top-notch. I highly recommend the arepas, and the plantains are delicious, too."}
{"text":"Excellent! Delicious and tasty. Arepa and Pupusas is a must try. Friendly people, nice music in background and a very good service. Reasonable price. You won't regret it. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Excellent value for the money. We started off with a half pitcher of Margaritas and it was very good. The Pupusas were delicious. We had a chicken and sausage Arepas and a chicken Pupusas. The meat and vegetables were freshly saute'ed and was very tasty. We would surely come back again."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews on yelp we decided to try them out. The restaurant itself is pretty plain, very loud paint on the walls, a nice little bar with stools  and limited seating. The service was great, very friendly and happy to explain everything on the menu.   To start we ordered the cheesy corn with chorizo and arepa fries. The cheesy corn was nice and creamy and had a ton of chorizo in it. The arepa fries were really greasy and tasted like the fryer had not been changed in a while. Also tried their famous Pupusa stuffed with chicharrone. It was very delicious and the side of homemade coleslaw and hot sauce was a nice compliment. For the entree we ordered the Bandeja Paisa. (rice, beans, plantains, chicharrone, Columbian sausage, avacodo, egg, steak and a plain arepa). While I love pork belly and they fried the hell out if it and it was awesome, it had a nice crunch as well as still having tender parts, the sausage was the star of the dish. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The plain arepa was underwhelming but I guess plain means plain. Over all great experience. Food overall was good as well as the freindly staff."}
{"text":"Low key, authentic, and cheap. The margaritas are great. The food is fresh and fast. A definite place to try!"}
{"text":"Great Meal!  I've been hooked on Columbian food since returning from Fort Lauderdale, this past fall.  I've been looking for really good Columbian food in the Cleveland area, and this fit the bill.  I visited at lunch time, during the week and there was a steady flow of customers, but I was seated right away.  The server was super nice.  I knew immediately that I wanted the Bandeja Paisa, a combo of the most tasty choices.  I also ordered a chicken empanada, which arrived first.  Not at all what I expected, but was very tasty.  I expected a turnover type item.  This was more of a ball of beautifully seasoned goodness.  There was so much flavor.  My entree arrived a short time later.  Seasoned rice (instead of the traditional white rice, nice touch), deep fried pork belly, red beans, avocado, chorizo, fried egg and plantains, all on one plate.  Everything was delightful, although the beans had a particular flavor that I couldn't quite identify, but pretty tasty nonetheless.  I can't wait to return to try some of the other offerings."}
{"text":"Service fast and friendly. Food cooked perfectly. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to offer great options."}
{"text":"After all the hype surrounding this humble Salvadoran and Columbian joint, bae and I had a profoundly lackluster experience. Not to say that anything in particular was done wrong, but no part of the meal really stood out.   It was quite a slow evening, so parking in the little adjacent lot was no trouble. We had to wait in the entrance for a while to get seated, but used the time to take in the short bar area and lollipops being sold for a quarter each. We opted for a booth table, hoping it would offer some shelter from the draft that blew in each time the door opened. Be careful with the booth seats as you might be bounced around if the neighbors are particularly boisterous! Menus and water were served.   Of course Pupusas, right? We got one with Chicharron (fried pork belly/skin) filling and one with Pollo (chicken) filling to split. They bring you a jar of curtido, spicy pickled slaw, that is a staple condiment of Salvadoran dining, but beware if you have a low spicy tolerance. Both were pretty bland, even though the ratio of filling to tortilla was good. We didn't feel like drowning the pupusas in sauce, so we turned to an order of Ceviche. It turned out to be a mound of fish on a large corn tortilla chip with a side of salsa. Not bad, but could definitely have used some more lime.    On Pupusas and a tiny Ceviche order alone we couldn't subsist, so we also got the Yuca con Chicharron since we love fresh starchy yuca and um, deep fried pork, duh. The yuca unfortunately was dry and disappointing and the chicharron pieces were overcooked so that I was more focused on trying to chew through the meat than the richness of the pork. We could have used some more water to wash down these dry morsels, but no water was forthcoming.   Bae and I were excited to try out this Latin American restaurant because it seemed authentic, but left feeling pretty meh. I'm keeping the 3 stars since they fill a poorly underserved niche and it could have been an off day, but it won't be my first choice when I need my next pupusa fix."}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic. They have both a Salvadoran and Colombian chef. Can't go wrong if it is what you are looking for. Service is good as well."}
{"text":"I have to say I was very impressed!  The tamales and pupusas were incredible!!! I was really impressed.  The food had excellent flavor!  I would highly recommend this place.  The service was outstanding!  And the prices are great too!!!"}
{"text":"Great food.  The chicken tamale was a delicious surprise.  It was wrapped in banana leaves keeping it moist and it was full of meat.  We got takeout as we were on the road and having it later.  Was wishing we had gotten more.  While there for lunch we had ceviche, arepas and sausage.  All good.  And I need to mention the tasty side sauces.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Cleveland. We always get our food to go and it is still piping hot when we get home. Literally everything on the menu is delicious. You cannot go wrong. They also sell their garlic sauce, the green one, separately. We get that and put it on everything."}
{"text":"This is a cozy little restaurant on Lorain road in Fairview park that has few tables and friendly service.  The food was fresh and very flavorful. Prices are reasonable.  Kids enjoyed their queso papusas. The pollo special with the special garlic sauce was really good. The arepa con Camaron was tasty as well but could have used some spices. They provide a chipotle and a verde sauce by the side.  Nice place and wort"}
{"text":"Great Colombian and Salvadorian street food. The pupusas were delicious and very big! Don't let the cheap price fool you, they are big! The arepas are a must try, very tasty and filling! One of the most genuine spots you can find in the Cleveland area. Will return at this place for sure!"}
{"text":"We ordered an arepa con chorizo with plantains and a pupusa with pork, beans, cheese and some kind of flower. The arepa was filled with chorizo, peppers and onions and the corn tortilla had been grilled which gave the shell a nice crunch and bit of smoke to complement its fillings. The plantains were good, we had no problem finishing them, but we're a bit greasier than I care for. The puposa was huge! It filled my plate. It was quite cheesy and had lots of beans and less pork. Overall we were rather pleased with our lunch and wouldn't hesitate to come back!"}
{"text":"This was a great discovery! A definite gem in authentic, Central American dining. The restaurant was clean and well lit. The ambiance is unassuming, but pleasant. The service was courteous and attentive. Our food was amazing. We tried several things from the menu and all of it was fantastic! I was recently in El Salvador, so I had a legitimate reference point for comparing the food from this restaurant to genuine cuisine from this area of the world. It certainly reminded me of my time abroad. The prices were also very good at El Arepazo y Pupuseria. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Has been on my list of places to try for a couple of years.  Got my chance about 45 minutes before closing and ordered the Camarones al Chipotle.   Order was up quickly and I inhaled it.  I'll be coming back to try out more of the menu as soon as I can - yum!  I ordered flan to go but they had just made it so  it hadn't cooled and set. Hey it's flan - of course I took it anyway and can't wait to try it later after I give it a couple of hours in the fridge."}
{"text":"Very good food very good service I really enjoyed everything is delicious   My favorites are the pupusas and Arepaz I recommend them are delicious I love"}
{"text":"Despite all the great reviews, our group left rather disappointed with the food we'd tried. Perhaps our expectations were a bit high due to the amazing ratings on their Yelp page, but the dishes were a bit dry and not seasoned well at all. I'm generally not the type to knock a place after only trying it once, but our experience was so negative that I really doubt I'd come here again. It's unfortunate, really. Hopefully it was just a bad day and others have a more positive experience here, but I don't want to risk it again."}
{"text":"Got a dinner here and order Mojarra Frita and Tostada de Ceviche. This is really authentic the food and great service too. Server is William and he is fast, quick and great service. Is a small restaurant in quiet neighborhood which and I live nearby for for my work trip. There are so many great for they have and I will definitely come back to try again."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch yesterday and I was very disappointed by my experience. I ordered take out - 3 steak tacos and 1 chicken & cheese pupusa. It was awful! The steak was dry, gummy & tasteless. The tacos had very minimal filling in them. The pupusa was less than desirable as the chicken seemed minced ; it wasn't apparent at all inside of it's flour shell and it was nothing else inside. No cheese. Nothing. I typically eat at the Pupuseria La Benedicíon on W. 105th. Their food is exceptional! They happened to be closed yesterday , which is why I came here but never again. I gave it one star because I had too."}
{"text":"Seriously the most amazing food! The food is well seasoned and high quality. You're eating something wholesome and traditional for a very good price. The waiters are awesome and very knowledgeable of the food they are serving. I recommend branching out from anything that looks familiar, and definitely try something different that you haven't tasted before. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Can't vouch for any of the food besides the arepas- I get them every time! I've tried a few different meat fillings, which are all delish.   Only complaint is their soggy fries. Fries seem like a weird accompaniment to the arepas - maybe it's the traditional side? Regardless, I'm not a fan."}
{"text":"Awesome food , the pupusas reminded Me so much of my Tia's . Mom wanted some pupusas so we drove 20 mins out of our way totally worth it ! Will for sure be back and bring friends too . Thanks for staying open late on a Sunday even tho we were the only ones in the restaurant."}
{"text":"From friendly waitstaff to fresh delicious food. Wr started off with empanadas and poupussas...they came out fresh and flavorful...for the main dish we had the deep fried whole fish for around 10 bucks... definitely a 5 star...the pollo con arizo was great as well... Must have the orchata as a beverage..."}
{"text":"Great little joint serving central and South American comfort food. Prices are almost too good to be true. Menu has something for everyone. Arepas, Plantains, yucca fries, papusas etc. The food is delicious and the portions are more than generous. Service is helpful if you aren't sure about menu items although the menu clearly describes the items.  I had the Arepa al pastor with tostones.  My wife had th arepa vegetales with plantains. Left feeling stuffed and quite happy. Definitely recommend this place to anyone. Will be back.  Btw they also have a full bar with a good selection of tequila and bottled beer."}
{"text":"Delicious. Period. If I lived closer to this place I'd probably not bother with cooking at home anymore! Everything we have tried has been really fantastic."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the quality of the food and service at El Arepazo Y Pupuseria. I came here for dinner on a week day. It was not crowded, but there were a couple of other tables full. The restaurant was neat and clean and had a very authentic feel to it. We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful waiter who asked if it was our first time trying out the place, and offered suggestions and help with deciding what we wanted to order. For two of us we ordered a pupusa to share and we each ordered an arepa. It was plenty of food!! The pupusa was filled with pork and cheese and it was melt-in-you-mouth delicious. It came with a little cup of salsa and one of slaw. In fact it was so tasty that I would order the entree size 3-pupusa's next time.   The arepa's were also delicious. We tried steak and chorizo. The meat was good, and melted cheese and grilled peppers complimented it. I don't really care for french fries, but these were fine. All of the arepa's come with fries.  I would definitely recommend this place and I am glad that it gets well deserved good reviews on yelp. Next time I would like to try some of the entrees that look fabulous in yelp photos!"}
{"text":"The pupusas were great, my family said the arepas were great, but I'm here to rage about the bandeja paisa.  Bandeja paisa...what is it? What isn't it!? Rice, beans, avocado, fried egg, an arepa, sausage, pork, chicharrones, and fried plantain...oh my. Surely this feast would cost a fortune? Nope, $11. And it wasn't like it was low quality food that you can pile on a plate to charge a low price for, no. This was good, VERY GOOD. Try this place!"}
{"text":"Whole fried tilapia is one of the best things in the world and this place rocks it! I've been here 3 times since moving to the west side and I'm in love! Great prices and great service."}
{"text":"I arrived with a recent Groupon in hand at 6pm tonight. I'm usually off put by all of the deep-fried goodness that comprises this type of food, but I was ready to indulge.  The server was very nice and informative.  We had the cheese empenada- it was good, but a little bit crispier that I like- usually prefer crisp and chewy.  The cheese & bean Pupusas was very tasty and i like the coleslaw served with it.  for entrees we had the grilled chicken & mushrooms over garlic rice and my guest had the bandeja  and was impressed.  I like much better than Barocco.  when we departed at 745pm every table was filled.  next time i will try an arepa. the prices are great and let you try many menu items!"}
{"text":"Best Hispanic food in the westside! I honestly think their street taco rival the one in LA. The people are super friendly, and it is a great place to watch the champions league.  Tip -order ahead even if ur dining in the restaurant. Your food will come out prompt and fresh right when u sit down."}
{"text":"Delicious pupusas and sweet plantains! The sangria was nice and light, but if you like yours more alcoholic, you'd probably prefer the margaritas. Their guacamole is also delicious--very fresh despite the distance from any avocado-growing climate."}
{"text":"A Celebration of Food from Colombia and Central America, good food at fair prices. We started off with two different wonderful Pupusas, only $1.99 each. The Pupusas de Queso con Loroco a cheese and Loroco (a small green unopened flower buds used as an herb for flavoring in Central America) and the Pupusas Revueita a pork, bean and cheese one. We also had the wonderful Arepas de Chorizo which was overstuffed with a wonderful mild chorizo, cooked with onions, bell pepper and tomatoes served in a grilled Arepa, along with some perfectly cooked French fries. We also tried a Empanadas de Carne, a fried stuffed pastry with meat, actually more beans than meat, but still ok. But the high light of all the dished served was the two fabulous sauces served with all the food, both so good they would make a old shoe taste good. One was a Salsa de Ajo a popular  Colombian sauce made with a mixture of mayonnaise, fresh garlic, lime juice and cilantro. The second was a Chipotle Mayonnaise. For beverages try a Latin American sodas, Mexican Coca Cola (made with cane sugar) or a Jarritos Mexican fruit flavored sodas. The service was friendly and efficient. The pace itself is small with only eight or nine tables and a small six seat counter. Note: The place was one of the cleanest establishments I have been in awhile, and the only reason I even noticed it was because how clean it even smelled. On my list to try, are the Tostada de Ceviche, a saw one come out of the kitchen and food envy set in, and I also want to try the Tamales de Pollo, a great reason to go back soon."}
{"text":"What a delightful, thoughtfully plated meal and experience I had at this little hole in the wall place! As evidenced by the name of the restaurant they specialize in arepas and pupusas. However, I tried a couple other menu items and they were authentic and delicious.  Full disclosure I've been to El Salvador and tried street Pupusas, these were a lot better. We started off with an appetizer of the bean and cheese pupusas (3) and they were huge. They came with a mild salsa and the traditional cabbage mixture that you put on top of the pupusas. Que rico?! It was so good, and easily could have made a meal out of that alone.  Next up I ordered two steak tacos in corn tortillas. The presentation was nice with parsley, lime, and perfectly cooked steak. It had a rich texture to it, I sensed some butter (never a bad thing).   My date had the plantains, a great side dish and/or dessert pairing. They had that hint of brown sugar(?) and cinnamon, with butter. It was excellent!  The portions were huge and the price was little, my kind of place! The staff were pleasant and this is definitely a place I'd like to frequent whenever I'm in the mood for authentic Latin cuisine. Next, I'll definitely have to try the arepas!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars because the next day I was so happy to wake up to leftovers, it was like a magical food birthday delight. Simple but good cooking hit the spot just right for me and my friends on a Sunday afternoon. The place had just opened for the day and it smelled clean when we walked in. There was a little boy who helped greet people and seat them which I thought was cute and showed this is a family run business. Now on to the food...   The food here is simple but all of the pairings work so well together. The empanada was a cheesy fried treat well complemented with the side of salsa. The pupusa was plain but the slaw and sauce gave it a boost of flavor. The Bandeja Paisa was the star of the show and a ton of food; rice, beans, steak, avocado, fried plantain, egg, Colombian sausage, a piece of bread?, and what looked to be a large pork rind."}
{"text":"The papusas, al tol, and epanadas were very good. Staff was extremely friendly.  I suggest you get the plaintains, eat them with the beans and sour cream, sounds weird, tastes great. And yes, that is the way they are meant to be eaten from what i have heard."}
{"text":"Great little find while traveling through Ohio. Fast service and good food. We all had an assortment of various items and everyone was so pleased. The sangria was very good and large!  Prices were very reasonable.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Upping the rating from 3 - 4 stars. As I had said initially, I was new to this cuisine. \"Flavorless?\" Hardly. You just need to know that the slaw and the sauce that comes with the Papusa are all to be eaten together. I've really grown to love this place. It's in the rotation of weekly dinner with my kids. Check it out and enjoy!"}
{"text":"An awesome place unlike anywhere we've been state-side. Very authentic and delicious. We had the pork empanadas (delicious and crispy), the guacamole with the fried plantains and the signature dish so shared on yelp that gives you a taste of everything. Margaritas were a great addition. We will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and have to say it was great.  Just a small place, two rooms with about a dozen tables, mainly booths.  The restaurant is clean with bright colored walls; not the kind of decor that will impress you, but serviceable enough.  Service was good, attentive and friendly.    I ordered the tostada de cervice and the pupusas lorroco.  The cervice was a large portion of shrimp and tilapia pieces with onions marinated in lime juice served on a tostada shell with a side of salsa.  It was tasty and tangy with just enough acid, delicious and well balanced.  The pupusa was a large patty of corn meal stuffed with mild cheese and lorroco flowers  with a side of sauce and a crispy slaw.  After being griddled fresh it had a wonderful taste with the sauce adding just enough heat.    I was impressed by the food and the portion sizes, especially at the prices they are charging.  I will definitely be back when I am on the west side of town.  Check it out, worth seeking out."}
{"text":"Much needed Latin restaurant in the Cleveland area! They offer something that I personally have not come across a lot in my many travels.   The food is excellent, you won't go wrong in whatever you decide to try here as the food has lots of flavor and I'm fairly certain you won't come across a lot of this commonly in the area. Glad to have them around.  I would suggest trying a few different things so you can get a taste for what they offer. There was 5 of us and I really got a great feel for the menu since we all tried different items. I'm glad they offer different Latin style items and is a change of pace from the typical. We loved every bite of our food and had us wanting more the next day.  This is a great place and I would recommend trying it out at least once."}
{"text":"Service and preparation are impeccable. I started with the Cheesy Corn with Chorizo and Arepa fries, a Pupusas de Queso con Laraco and then the Bandeja Paisa. I'm telling you now that this was enough for at least two people.... but I wanted to try a number of things. Everying I put in my mouth was FANTASTIC! The sauces are great, too. And if you ask for their hottest sauce, they might bring you a fantastic salsa made with sorrano and ghost peppers with a little fresh onion and cilantro. Not too hot - just right!  As an update to earlier posts I read, they now have a liquor license and the margaritas are good and strong. I saw signs stating $1.99 bottled beer during Happy Hours 2-6pm."}
{"text":"Very unique and delicious food, I recommend this place to everyone! But I recently found out that our bill got double charged. An honest mistake, I'm sure, but if we didn't check our credit card statements, it would have just gone right through without notice."}
{"text":"We were looking for something different after a day filled with meetings. The local yelp reviews lead us here. We had no idea what to order, but our Very helpful waiter gave suggestions.   I began with a frozen mango margarita that hit the spot. The fried beef empanadas were great as starters. I added a little tapatío salsa picante that nearly took my tongue off!  Lol. For meal I had the arepas con chirorizo, but was too stuffed to enjoy it. I'd definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I'm not very well versed on Columbian food, but I have eaten a lot of food so I hope those credentials are sufficient enough to let me convince you that this place is a gem!  The service is great - everyone is so friendly!  The cheese empanadas are what I daydream about and the pupusas are delicious too.  I've kept it pretty simple so I can't speak for the rest of the menu.  It's ridiculously cheap too.  The location is a little hidden, but it's worth a visit for those cheese empanandas alone!"}
{"text":"The service was very excellent and so was the food. This won't be my last time coming here. Everything is so fresh and authentic"}
{"text":"My parents loveeee pupusas, and they love this place.   The zucchini pupusa--who knew?!?! It's AMAZING! The sweetness of the zucchini balances so well with the salty cheese and the acidity of the slaw!   The bean ones and cheese ones are also good! I think they also have pork.   They also have arepas, I'll definitely have to get one next time! I get so focused on the pupusas that I forget!!   Great local business definitely go get yourself a pupusa immediately! I love CLE's multicultural food experiences!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Come here for a good \"casada\"- homemade meal with a protein, rice, beans, and plantains.  Everything was well made, the service was great, and the prices more than reasonable. I'll be back when I get my next latin american food craving."}
{"text":"I only came here for takeout so I can't say much about the establishment itself, but the place was super clean at the time, and the worker who took our order was welcoming, friendly, and helpful with the menu.  I ordered the chorizo arepa, a pupusa with pork, beans, and cheese, and a pork empanada.  It was my first time trying both an arepa and a pupusa, but I did my homework before coming here and figured they'd be right up my alley. The pupusa was huge and had an irresistable aroma of buttery corn that I was immediately reminded of theater popcorn... in a good way. Add to that the filling, and DON'T forget the slaw and sauce, and it was a party of flavors in my mouth. I seriously couldn't get over the aroma and flavor of the corn. It was like crack. I have yet to try that other, more popular pupuseria in Cleveland to compare, but I do know that I loved this one.  I was less enthused with the arepa. It was simple and good but nothing spectacular. The fries were average at best. I probably wouldn't get it again.  The Colombian empanada comes in a smaller size than other variations. I did not know this. It was about the size of one and a half oreos around, and maybe 2 oreos thick (why aren't oreos an accepted unit of measurement?). Don't underestimate it though. It was packed with savory goodness in a super crispy shell. The potato and pork filling had a bit of cumin or some kind of mild curry flavor in it, and that along with the nice puffy shell actually reminded me of a samosa... in a good way. This was probably my favorite part of the meal. I'm a sucker for emapanadas though.  I'll definitely be back for more. 4.5."}
{"text":"Stopped for a short meal before a long flight. Great food, great service, great price, was in and out in 20 minutes. Not too loud. Free parking. Also, the flan is real flan, not custard or clotted cream. What more can you want?"}
{"text":"This wonderful little gem is a great place for a date night when you want to try something off the beaten path.  The staff is polite and attentive and it is usually quiet.  The menu is small but deciding can be hard.  The arepas are a favorite here.  Don't be afraid to try the dinners.  A giant hunk of bacon-style meat, an egg, rice, spicy sausage, saucy beans.  Oh so good.  One thing you must try is their home made sauces that usually come with the Arepas.  That giant bottle of hot sauce is amazing."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write this review for some time now. El Arepazo Y Pupuseria is my favorite!! It's somewhat of a 'hidden gem'. It's located in Fairview Park and is not only FP's best restaurant, but I realized it is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. Every dish I have ever had has been amazing- you can tell they are passionate about their food as everything is always fresh, authentic and presented beautifully. Every time I have eaten there I always leave satisfied. The cost of the meals is very reasonable. We always like to try something new each time we visit. Today I ordered the  Camarones Al Chipotle, a shrimp dish with a slightly spicy red sauce, salad with tomato and avacado, and rice. My husband got the chicken soup which was a large bowl of soup with vegetables served with rice and a huge piece of chicken on the side and he also ordered an empanadita. Our son got a cheese pupusa, rice and beans. We have always had great service as well, everyone is always very friendly. I hope El Arepazo Y Pupuseria staysail in FP forever! We plan on eating there once a week!!"}
{"text":"I'm not very familiar with Columbian & Salvadorian cuisine but after seeing all the wonderful reviews on yelp about this place, I knew I had to check this place out.  I'm so happy that I did, the food was great! My boyfriend got the arepas filled with steak & it was so tasty. The arepas was STUFFED with steak, cheese, peppers, & onions. It also came with fries & those fries were some of the best fries I've ever had.  I ordered all 3 of the different empanadas (cheese, pork, & beef). All 3 were stuffed with filling. My favorite was the cheese. I also got the pupusas filled with pork & that was pretty good as well.   The meal was so affordable, we couldn't believe how inexpensive everything was. The customer service was great too, the waiter was very attentive!  This place is definitely a hidden gem in Fairview Park. This place should be packed! There is no doubt that I'll be back again...and again."}
{"text":"Excellent taste ! The food was fresh and well prepared ! The servers where 2 for the entire place ; yet the did a great job!"}
{"text":"I'm Salvadorian and I went there today for my first time and must say that everything was pretty delicious and authentic. I had the pupusas and the bandeja paisa. The service was great and the place was very clean. I definitely want to go back and try other dishes I saw on the menu. I live about 40 miles away but would definitely make a trip out there again for this place!"}
{"text":"Food is outstanding!  Margaritas are good too!  Bathroom left a little to be desired. A quick wipe down of the inside of the door would make a world of difference. Overall food and drink very good!"}
{"text":"Hard to find/ easy to overlook, so pay close attention and go! It's small, nothing fancy, but the food is amazing. Their guacamole is so fresh and flavorful, that it's perhaps my favorite I've had. My favorite is the cheese zucchini pupusas. Usually we will split the 3 pupusas and each get an arepazo. The chicken one is amazing, so rich, creamy, and filling! We always end up with leftovers."}
{"text":"Two very hard working servers.  Small and packed at 3 PM on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. Wonderful food with booming take out."}
{"text":"Loved the plantains!  Was a great option instead of fries. The papusas were really big, like a pancake. I would go here again."}
{"text":"100% authentic. Pupusas are excellent.  If you're hungry and on the west side, hit it up."}
{"text":"Delicious! Wish we'd came here long time before! We ordered the bandeja paisa, the picada Colombiana, and pupusa de pollo. I could barely finish. My wife took half her meal home."}
{"text":"Yum!  The arepas were fresh and flavorful and the empanadas were delicious and a bargain at $2 each.  A must try."}
{"text":"This place is a gem you wouldn't expect to find in Fairview. The zucchini and cheese pupusas are delicious and the chicken and steak arepas are phenomenal. But, my absolute favorite item from here are their empanadas, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I like to smother mine in their avocado sauce but to each their own. The servers are always welcoming.  Definitely gives Barocco some competition."}
{"text":"I have literally dreamt about the cheese empanada I had here. The outside SO CRISPY! And very thin, not the frozen thick dough. There was literally so much cheese inside it blew me away. Not like a little bit at the bottom and on the sides, leaving you for empty bites. It was full bites of cheese and crispy hot outside. So good.   The pupusas are also soo good. What kind of cheese do they use? It's stringy like a melted mozz but tangy and salty like a blanco queso. Ugh it's so good.   The fries are probably pre made but we're fried in clean oil, tastes fresh and hot. The sauces are good - garlic sauce on everything!!!!   The place is small and looks hole in the wall/family restaurant but it's cozy. Don't judge a book by its cover (or decor).   I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Just a great little place with great food. The pupusas are top notch and prices are great to boot!"}
{"text":"We live within walking distance and never tried it because didn't notice it. Went one Sunday with friends that highly recommend it and i was very pleasantly surprised. Great papusas and arepas and really big portions. The guacamole was fresh and tasted very good.The interior is not appealing but the food is amazing . Will go back soon"}
{"text":"I have to laugh at the review that wouldn't give 5 stars because they thought the exterior of the building wasn''t what they liked, LOL. It's actually a quaint tudor style storefront that had been a local bar for years. The interior is clean and bright, not full of tacky \"latin\" decorations.   Staff was friendly and helpful. The food was excellent. I tired three different dishes and found them all well done and flavorful. The Pupusas are a treat.   Go next door to El Rodeo if you like Gringo Mexican... you can't miss the building ;)"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try the Pupuseria on 105, but for some reason, I have yet to go. And while I still plan to, I was lured to El Arepazo via a Groupon. I hadn't heard about the new place, so I hit Google for some more info. I liked what I saw, and couldn't wait to try it!  OH. MY. GOD.  Why did I wait so long??  We headed over early on a Friday, as I heard it could get a bit crowded. And we DEFINITELY beat the crowd (by the time we left, each booth was full!)  We were greeted by not only wonderful people (including the kids!) but sounds and aromas of a kitchen that took pride in their love of serving authentic, fabulous food. And fabulous? IT WAS.  We decided to family style it and ordered:  Empanadas de Puerco, Pupusas de Queso con Loroco, Bandeja Paisa, El Sabrason and the Conserva de Plantano for dessert (I am such a sucker for plantains and bananas!)  The pork empanada came out first, and it was shaped & fried to perfection! The side of pico was a delightful balance as well.  The pupusa...SO FLUFFLY and good! I call pupusas the Salvadorian Polenta :) Be sure to enjoy it with the slaw and sauce...and if you want to kick it up a notch, add some of the hot sauce on the table. Simple? Yes. Delicious? OH YES.  Our entrees were a sampler of complete awesomeness!  Starting with the El Sabrason: Scrambled eggs, black beans, plantains, sour cream and cheese. Although visually it was a little plain, the flavors were amazingly wonderful! Score for the fresh cheese too! WOW!  The star of our menu choice, IMHO, was the Bandeja Paisa. OH MY HEAVEN. A platter of rice, beans, plantains, pork, Columbian sausage, avocado and egg. Not to mention the surprise beef steak and small corn biscuit. The plaintains were AMAZING. And the columbian sausage won my heart! But layering the flavors with the biscuit, beans, and cracking the egg atop? WOW.  Ok. HIGHLY recommend trying this as your first entree..  Our dessert? A wonderful surprise of \"banana candy\" which I simply must find a recipe for :)  I will be back. And you? Should go.  PS...Be sure to tip the young wait staff. They are adorable :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Only problem was the waitress had a terrible attitude.  It was almost as if she was dreading any more customers for the night. It was 6 pm.  Major \"CBF\" (c h r o n i c b i t c h f a c e)  enjoi betches!"}
{"text":"My entire family loves this place. Nice selection of regional beers and damn fine cocktails.$2.99 a beer on Saturdays. Empanadas,especially the cheese,are one of kind delicious.My 86yo German mom is addicted to them,good thing she lives in the neighborhood. Pupusas are all great.The curtido gives them a nice crunch to go along with all the gooey goodness. The tamales are cooked in banana leaves and are the best,I can't eat other tamales anymore. Arepas are all good,chicken is my favorite.I usually get the plantains instead of the fries.The sauces,Chipotle and creamy Chimichurri, would make an old sneaker taste good. The entrees I've tried have all been just outstanding,it's like your grandma's cooking for you..Bandeja Paisa is my favorite so far. Prices are nice,portions are large. A family run place that treats you like family."}
{"text":"This is my first review on yelp , and i want to say that the  arepa and  empanadas are to die for i had a veggie arepa and the bean pupusa.  They were excellent . I will definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"The food was really great. I can't describe the amazingness of the cheese empanadas. Also ate the arepas de chorizo; which was amazing plus the garlic arepa sauce was really good on top. We got the tostones instead of basic fries, good as well. All around great food, great small feel. We came in on a Saturday night around 8, no crowd. I will be coming back here to sample more of the menu."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic taste of El Salvadoran and Colombian cuisine, this is the place to go. Located in an unassuming house in the corner with a small parking lot in the back, it can be easy to miss the first time you're going to visit.   Once you're there, there's tables and booths available to sit at. The menu offers a variety of options. I have tried the cheesy corn with chorizo and ceviche appetizers, the Pupusas revueltas, and the fried fish. All of their food was great, but definitely don't miss out on the cheesy corn with chorizo and the Pupusas. They have different styles of Pupusas, so it shouldn't be hard to find one you like. For anyone that doesn't know, a Pupusas is a sort of thick fried tortillas stuffed with cheese and meat. They're variations include stuffed with vegetable, cheese, meat, beans, and combinations of the above.   Do yourself a favor and check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic arepas and pupusas, plus they have yuca fries, horchata, fried plantains... This place is great! The only negative thing I have to say is that the service is quite slow; with 1-2 people, you may be able to be in and out in an hour, but once you get up to a group of 4-6, you'll likely need close to 2 hours, so this isn't a place you want to go under a time constraint."}
{"text":"We have eaten here since they opened and have never been disappointed! The empanadas are crispy & full of flavor, the plantains (whether you get them sweet or savory) are little nuggets of deliciousness. Try the chorizo arepa or any of the pupusas and don't forget to save room for nuegados for dessert."}
{"text":"People who work here nice guys! Food is good. I would recommend getting Pupus and fried banana with guacamole. It's a small place but that's good won't get over crowded."}
{"text":"We stopped by before heading to the airport. Small place and we were the only people there at 5:30 at a Tues.  The waiter was very friendly and attentive. The food come out quickly but was all fresh. Delicious pico and guacamole.... Husband literally ate it alone with a spoon. The pupusas Loca was so delicious, like a quesadilla, but so much better.  Highly recommend this place for something new!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a good mexican restaurant when we stumbled upon this Columbian/El Salvadorian gem.  It's a hole in the wall kind of place, but well worth checking out.  The service was great, the food was authentic, high quality, and quite delicious.  I highly recommend this establishment if you're looking for something unique and out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"A very kind Yelper told me that this place was still open so I decided to give them a second chance.  So here's my updated review.   I visited this place during the dinner service 01/11/14.  The place was empty so I had plenty of tables to choose from which was good because I was starving.  I ordered a few of the menu staples like pupusas, empanada de queso, tostada de ceviche, and yuca with chicken.  I was pleasantly surprised when the food was served about 10-15 minutes later, but then again, the place was empty.    The pupusas were the cheesiest pupupas I've ever had; the cheese just oozed off of them.  Eating these pupusas reminded me of eating a slice of New York pizza with extra cheese.  The curtido (a mix of vegetables with a vinegar concoction) was fresh and tasty.  There's a sauce that goes on top of the pupusas as well which was good but I've had better.  In my opinion, La Casa Tazumal in Cleveland still has the best pupusas around, so even though these were good, there are also much better pupusas in town.   The cheese empanada I did not like at all.  It's basically a fried ball of cheese that's not cooked all the way through.  Some of the cheese was melted but when you got to the center the chesse was cold and firm (no bueno).    The ceviche tostada not good either.  I've had some pretty amazing ceviche in my life and this was by far the worst.  If you like oregano and hate lime this is perfect for you.  The oregano overpowered the dish and the lack of lime just did not give it that ceviche feel that I was expecting.  The yuca was good.  However, I have to admit that I've never had fried yuca before so I really don't have anything to compare it too.    All in all, I would recommend this place if you really have a pupusa craving and you don't want to have to drive to Cleveland to kill it.    Cheers!"}
{"text":"First time here today. LOVED the steak arepas  !  So delicious! Also enjoyed the pork, bean and cheese pupusa. Will be back for more soon. And don't forget to try the sauces. Yummy."}
{"text":"On a cost/value basis, this is easily five stars. I came here famished with my husband on the tail-end of what may have been the greatest pub crawl ever (west Cleveland dives for the win). We stuffed ourselves silly for less than $20. The meal included the namesake pupusas, a great empanada, and a spectacular chicken soup that came with a mesmerizing fried leg and thigh. Good, cheap, fast. You get all three here."}
{"text":"Took the wife and kids here and can honestly say the food was amazing. hands down the best Arepa's I've ever had and I've had quite a few in my day. definitely a good choice!"}
{"text":"Had one night in Cleveland, and did not expect to find killer pupusas and excellent sangria. The arepas were also excellent, and the service super friendly. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall is something special. The arepas are the best in Cleveland. I like them better then bracco's, and reason being I feel at bracco's the bread they use is harder. The pupsas and empanadas are great as well. The prices are very reasonable and great for the family."}
{"text":"Great arepas, and the garlic sauce is full of flavor. A little pricier than you would expect."}
{"text":"This small, friendly, family-run Colombian & Salvadorian restaurant is a West Side Cleveland (Fairview Park) GEM!  The atmosphere is simple and inviting, with a few quaint booths and tables, complete with some cool latin music in the backround.  The food is DELICIOUS, and priced very reasonably (they even have a kid's menu for finicky ones).  I especially loved the pupusas and shrimp arepa.  So flavorful and well balanced... MMMMM!  The special sauces that complement many of their foods were fantastic as well.  The staff is very friendly too.  This place is why I support local 'mom and pop' eateries, and I can't wait to come back here again!"}
{"text":"Enjoy the caldo de res delicious also try taco of steak green chili GREAT all with ice cold modelo I'm happy"}
{"text":"Holy Cow....my friend was in from Kansas City and so I selected this place based solely on Yelp Reviews and my faith in Yelpers being accurate....I am super glad I did! It looks like a lot of the Mexican restaurant interiors, but don't be fooled, this food is very different!  I selected the especial de pollo with garlic sauce-this chicken arrived on a mound of steaming white rice, with mushrooms and four large slices of freshly cut avocado.  I took one bite and I immediately made my friend eat some, and he agreed that it was amazing!  He ordered two of this interesting pancake-like items called papusas, which encased your choice of filling- he chose chicken and beans.  These are extremely tasty and filling.  Margarita was great! I've never had the opportunity to try Colombian food; and I'm glad Yelp gave me the chance to find this place because I immediately told three more people about it the same day we went.   If you're on the fence, please do yourself a favor and visit because the menu is large and there's something for everyone....this is also the perfect place to go if you don't know what you're in the mood for."}
{"text":"I am sans computer, so I find it a pain in the \"you know what\" to write a review from my phone. But this place is damn good.   I had two pupusas, one cheese with loroco, the other mixed with pork and cheese. My fella had similar, plus some empanadas (which I of course snuck a bite or two from). So tasty! I always love the red sauce that comes with pupusas, but the spicy slaw was better than other places I've tried. The pupusas themselves were filling yet less greasy than when I've had em in the past. And the empanadas? Super flaky! The service was prompt and friendly without being overbearing. I hope more people try this place out, it's super tasty. Plus $20 dinner for two ain't bad either!"}
{"text":"This place was close to the hotel we stayed overnight on our way to NJ.  We never had Colombian food, and the Yelp reviews were great, so we decided to give a try.  I ordered Seafood Arepa and fried Yuca. The Arepa shell was kind of hard. We also ordered other dishes including grilled tilapia (excellent), Bandeja Paisa (great) and pork chop (too dry due to over cooked). The Pupusa was okay, it might be an acquired taste."}
{"text":"I've been having a serious craving for arepas after having them in Albuquerque, NM about 2 years ago so I was happy when I found this place. I travel for work and eat out all the time so I'm always looking for good food and this place has it! Very authentic, very flavorful and very fast. This prices aren't bad for the amount of food you get either. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Being fresh to CLE from the SF Bay Area, we have been deprived of the usual requisite of Latin dishes that have become staple parts of our diets (we lived near Fruitvale in Oakland for eight years--one of the last Spanish-speaking neighborhoods to be gentrified in the Bay). After a hike by the Rocky River, we found this pupuseria. It satisfied our hunger and made us feel at home. The pupusia were bigger and higher quality than what I was used to and the slaw was great. The only thing I found wanting was the hot sauce--not spicy at all, but even a little bland. But other than that, this place is the real deal. Happy to call this one of our new favorite places!"}
{"text":"I've had El Salvadorian food a few times, and this was definitely the top outside of homemade by a friend. It's an excellent little inexpensive restaurant with homemade food, good service, and a friendly staff.   Pros: - The Pupusas are quite good. Freshly made (it does take a while, so don't expect to get out in 5 minute). We had a bean & cheese and a pork, bean & cheese. Both were excellent alone, but after adding their spicy slaw, they're elevated to something else. Wonderful, and only $2 each. You could easily get 3-4 to feed 2 people and both leave happy. - Everything was wonderfully fresh. It was quite obvious that all the food was made especially for us - not left to sit in a warmer drawer all afternoon. - The server was quite nice. I'm assuming he also made most of the food, as he disappeared while the food was being cooked, but came back multiple times to check to make sure everything was just perfect. - The sauces served with the arepas. OH MY GOSH. I loved the garlicky sauce. Chipotle isn't my bag, so pass. The mustard, though. Wow. It brought a whole new level to my arepas (corn meal pancakes with meat and veggies inside.) I was super impressed. The server said all three were homemade at the shop. I believe it.  Cons: - Their Horchata wasn't very good. I'm not sure what was off about it, but I didn't like it. Not enough spice, I think. - The arepas was very oily. I got chorizo, which I'm guessing heavily contributed to that, but I could have used a towel to keep my hands clean as I ate it.  Overall, for under $25 we had way too much food for 2 of us and our 2 year old son. I think we easily could have gotten out of there for $15, but we wanted to try a bunch of things. It's not a fancy restaurant, but not a dive. Really just a local place serving good, fresh food."}
{"text":"What a nice surprise during a long visit to the area. We were looking for something different and so happy that we found this place. Ordered a good smattering of the specialties and the service was quick and pleasant. The food was delicious. I especially enjoyed the pupusas as well as the housemade chipotle sauce. What a value, too. Large portions for very reasonable prices. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This is such a good find for super hearty El Salvadorean and Colombian food. Pupusas and tostones are divine obviously, but their bandeja paisa is great and less than $15!!! They do also have good lunch specials. I think the arepas are better at Barocco, but the other dishes here are just as good and a better value."}
{"text":"very good empanadas and pupusas. we tried the pork empanadas, pupusa revuelta (pork, cheese, and beans), and pupusa de loroco. they were all delicious for a price that can't be beat - $2/pupusa, $2.5/empanada.  we also tried the bandeja paisa ($11.95) - a combo of rice, plantains, pork belly, chorizo, beef, beans, an avocado, and a fried egg. the dish is nothing out of the ordinary. you won't find new exotic flavors from this - which some people may complain about. however, that's what it's meant to be. it should simply taste like a wholesome homemade meal.  great food + great prices + great service earns this restaurant 5 stars"}
{"text":"Amazing! My girl friend brought me here a few months ago to try some new cuisines since I am very interested in trying new foods. At first I was a little skeptical but once we got our food I was in heaven. I highly recommend any of the pupusas, they are out of this world. Our server was very nice as well. It made it such a great experience that we are meeting there for dinner again tonight. For the price and the quality of food, you cannot go wrong."}
{"text":"I love the whole fried fish. I always ask for it extra crispy. They're very friendly and it always has a very clean aspect.  Their pupusas are very authentic and tasty. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants authentic Latino food!"}
{"text":"My happy place. These pupusas are so divine. I go for the just cheese and pork. Ask for extra slaw and make sure to get the sauces."}
{"text":"Intimate yet casual place. Very cheap and large portions. I was in El Salvador for a week and I had to try it once I came home. Not quite authentic, but pretty darn close. Eat the spicy vegetables!"}
{"text":"This is a must visit for anyone looking for some good Latino food in Cleveland.  The arepas and pupusas were amazing.    This is not your typical Mexican food joint.  It is Colombian and El Salvadoran -- so adjust your expectations and be ready to be amazed!"}
{"text":"We found this gem using Yelp search as we wanted to find Columbian Food!! This place was just the ticket!! Food was great, Drinks were tasty, and Service was great!!  I will be returning here again to satisfy my Columbian cravings!!  Hey!! The Margaritas are Top Notch!!"}
{"text":"Love all the new menu options!! Delicious and crispy tostones with guacamole appetizer! The chicken arepa I ordered was twice the size I expected and stuffed with a humongous amount of chicken, cheese and vegetables!  I always love the empanadas and my family members loved their chicken and chorizo tacos loaded with cilantro and onions!  Make sure to look for the nuegados - soft, thick donuts in a brown sugar-honey sauce! Also, my mom wants to make sure you order the side of beans - it's the whole bean and not that refried mush! I can't wait to go back and order the sweet tamale!!"}
{"text":"To say I love pupusas is an understatement. The pupusa is buried deep in my DNA. No, my soul.  I am pupusas, and pupusas are me.   I heard Juanes playing when I walked through the doors and immediately felt at home. I ordered what I usually order when I evaluate an El Salvadoran restaurant: 3 different pupusas, and plantains with beans and crema.  The Plantains were perfect. They were as good as the best I've ever had. Split in half and fried to the perfect consistency and texture, with the sugar of the plantain caramelized on the outside. People can really screw up fried plantains! These couldn't have been better.  As I ripped into my pupusas with my bear hands, like some kind of animal, the waiter sneakily slipped me a couple extra napkins and gave me a nod of approval. With more quesillo than you typically find in a pupusa, I was pleased.   Are they the absolute best pupusas I've ever had? No, but I've eaten enough pupusas in my life to fill up 4 large taxis.   Are they authentic? Yes.   Did I have a spiritual experience, where I temporarily left my body and saw the quartet of Salvadoran pupusa gods singing praises and showering my soul with the cheesy frijole laden everlasting warmth. Yes. Yes, I did.   I will be back here"}
{"text":"I had the Bandeja Paisa and a cheese filled empanada. This was extremely salty and greasy. The cheese in the empanada was cold in the middle. The Columbian sausage was the best part."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations.  It's very small and unassuming but sooo good.  I started with the cheese empanadas which were really good.  They were bigger than I expected and so gooey.  Then I had a steak taco which had some of the most tender steak I've had in a street style taco.  The fried plantains were great and the pupusas were awesome. The prices were good too."}
{"text":"First time dining here at this tiny little place. The business is so close to the road it is almost in the road! The building could be viewed as a house. Now to the food. Grande delicioso!"}
{"text":"Good day for me as a Yelper! Hit the spot  for us. My husband and I have been big fans of Colombian food and this place was the bomb. Servings are huge yet tasty. Dishes tasted like what your abuela (grandmother) will cook for you. Even if it's a 30-minute drive for us, we will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Yup.  I'll be back for sure. I have never had pupusas or arepas, but we were feeling adventurous so gave it a shot.  The portions were more than generous, service was friendly and swift and the price was right. I spent about $43 for lunch for 3 people- included drinks, 1 single pupusa, the chorizo and egg lunch (with rice, beans and tortillas) a plate of 3 pupusas, a chicken tamale, 1 arepa with fries, fried plantains and avocado on the side.  I had to sample everyone's food, but mine was so delicious I certainly overdid it. The slaw and picante sauce they served was so fresh and flavorful. My cheese pupusa was a perfect pillow of cheesy goodness. I even sampled the chipotle and garlic sauce they brought with the arepas. I am personally not a fan of plantains, but my friends said they were cooked perfect and deliciously.  Not only will I be back (Must have an empanada) but I can't wait to rush home from work today and have my leftovers.  :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome fresh food. Great clean place. Friendly staff. Will definitely be on my short list."}
{"text":"I had dropped of my son at the airport and was looking for a decent meal without breaking the bank, so I turned to Yelp and discovered El Aerpazo Y Pupsaeria, at first I will admit I was a skeptic because of the bar, size and low lights illuminating the restaurant .   However, OMG... I was pleasantly surprised, I have sampled Pupusa's in the Mission District in San Francisco, Ca which are very authentic but these were not only comparable but excellent, I opted for a seafood Arepa and I don't believe I can do this culinary delight any justice, it was a incredibly amazing culinary experience with positive results. The freshness combined with the flavors were extraordinary as well as delicious, the chilled sauce (orange looking in the squeeze bottle) complimented the meal with zest.  I definitely  will be returning to sample other items on their menu.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A must-visit.  Started with cheese empanadas, which turned out to be bigger than I had anticipated. Fully stuffed with delicious melted cheese, three of these were more than I could handle with the arepa I also got. The empanadas come with diced veggies; they added a great, spicy crunch when sprinkled on the cheese.  I'd rate the arepa just behind Barroco Grill, but it's a close call. Arepazo's came with a couple of sauces. I tried a bit, but ended up deciding the arepa was so good on its own that I didn't want them. Mine was the arepa con loca; peppers and meat were prepared very well and the flavors blended perfectly."}
{"text":"So right off the bat I'm willing to admit I didn't know what an arepa OR pupusa were before entering the doors of this fine establishment.    To sum it up for you, arepas are magical and pupusas are their bewitching brother in law.   We tried an arepa with fries and my god, the corn like sandwich filled with meat, cheese, and veggies was so delicious.  I would say it was like the Colombian/Salvadorian version of an overflowing cheese steak.  As for the pupusa, if you stuff anything in anything you're pretty much set up for delicious success.  I don't care how that sounds, but I stand by it.  The dining room was small and plain; it was perfect.  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"We've been planning on going to dinner here for three weeks now. Thank goodness we made time tonight. I'm not going to lie, hubby and I were both thinking we made a mistake when we walked in. It's very small, booths all taken so we sat in front of cold window. Let's just say, after drinking my huge mango margarita I wasn't feeling the cold. Hubby didn't know what to order because he's very picky but with a little help we both ordered some delicious meals. We couldn't get through half our plates because we were stuffed but it wasn't stopping us from trying the flan. Service and food were excellent. We will be back for more."}
{"text":"Great food!! Loved the plantains, empanadas and black beans. Simple, flavorful food. A few unique flavors I've not encountered in Mexican food... The woman serving me was very pleasant and welcoming, answered all my questions. The pricing and items on the menu need to be clearer, not so easy to understand what I was ordering. For two people, spent $29.00 before tip...  If the menu was easier to read, I wouldn't have spent so much."}
{"text":"Good stuff.  Good service, good Papua, and plantains.  Stopped here with the family after picking up our rental car at the airport.  Happy we stopped."}
{"text":"To start off, this place is amazing. It's this small gem on the corner that's easy to miss. I've been there at least 15 times by now and have tried just about everything on the menu.   To start, the papusas are divine. Perfectly filled and the slaw and salsa that accompany it are wonderful. The empanadas are crisp and hot. And the start of the show is the cheesy corn with chorizo. It's perfectly seasoned and comes out very hot. It is served with fries and a spoon.   The Bandeja Paisa is a sampler of everything. The rice and beans are cooked to be creamy and flavorful, the steak is tender, the sausage is spicy, and the pork is crisp.   The arepas are filled beyond the edge. Simply seasoned and very tasty. But the sauces that it's served with are reason enough to order one or two.    I have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing!  In town for biz near airport.  Yelpers totally steered me to the right place.  Totally simple but so good.  I think it was made fresh upon my order.  Stayed warm the whole time.  Arepas with fries and those sauces was one of the best meals I've had in a while.  Hoping for another biz trip to Cleveland soon just to try other things on menu.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently.  I tried 3 pupusa's and they were very very good.  I tried a pork, chicken, and pork and cheese.  The outside of these delights are somewhat crisp, or crunchy, while the interior is tender and delicious.  They are served with a side of slaw and tomato sauce.  Server told me to eat them however I wanted.  That in Columbia people eat it with tomato sauce on top with some slaw.  Or nothing.  It's a personal preference.  I enjoyed them with both the tomato sauce and slaw on top.  Only reason I give it 4 and not 5 stars is the ambiance.  It's in an old building and you will pass it by easily unless you are looking for it.  Old brick exterior and the inside isn't anything fancy either.  Old tables, booths, etc.  Truly a dive.    I'll go back for the food.  There are more items on the menu I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Outstanding - and I am obsessed! On my first trip to El Arepazo Y Pupuseria, I enjoyed a chicken arepa with plantains - devouring every bite with groans of pleasure and a smile from ear-to-ear. The corn arepa is chewy, crispy, and satisfying and the meat-and-vegetable filling is spiced and grilled to sumptuous perfection. Along with the chipotle and avocado aioli sauces, this arepa is a perfect comfort food. This first visit will certainly not be my last!"}
{"text":"Very impressed by the arepas and pupusas.    We came on a whim, having driven by and my love for pupusas drew me into the building.  The building itself is under decorated, minimal and seemed to highlight La Mega and ESPN-Espanol.    Though the service was a little slow, our server was excellent.  Trying his best to single-handed keep a very busy restaurant happy.    We ordered pupusas and arepas (of course) and everything was jam packed with yummy goodness.  The vegetarian arepa was a strange goo of beans, rice, cheese and vegies, which though looked rather unappetizing, was actually quite good.    The table behind us had some of the \"Casa\" specials.  They smelled amazing and it made me realize we'd gone the easy route.  I'd love to be back and next time we're going for full entrees!"}
{"text":"Our dishes were all hits including...  Arepas with chicken  Arepas with mixed meat  Pupusa with black bean and cheese  Best of all were the chipotle sauce and avocado / garlic sauce. They'll do their magic on anything.   Great service and Latin music made for the perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"I tried a few things I have never eaten before a me enjoyed them. Kind and attentive service. Table by the window. Small but spacious. I asked the waiter to recommend and he chose a meal with lots of variety. It was served with half an avocado that realm added to the flavor."}
{"text":"I love pupusas. I've had them made fresh for me on the side of the street in El Salvador. What I wasn't the biggest fan of ? This place. Everything was mediocre. The cabbage had no flavor. The sauce was runny. The service was barely tolerable. The restaurant was dingy... and possibly borderline filthy. I don't think I will be back. Too bad..."}
{"text":"This food was delicious. I popped in for a quick lunch while running errands in the area and I'm so glad that I did. I ordered the arepa con chorizo and substituted the fries for yuca. Every bite of the arepa was bursting with savory flavor, from the chorizo (completely approachable spice level) to the sauteed onions and peppers, from the crisp-yet-soft arepa to the melted cheesy goodness. The yuca was fried to perfection: lightly golden on the outside and soft on the inside. Don't even get me started on the sauces...both the creamy garlic sauce and the chipotle sauce went well with the arepa and yuca. I couldn't pick a favorite, and trust me when I say I sampled quite a bit trying to pick.  After my lunch, I decided to take home some pupusas for the fam and they did not disappoint. I chose queso con loroco because I'm always looking for something new or different to try. We had the pupusas for dinner and they were amazing hours and hours later. I'm sure I was missing some of that \"fresh off the griddle\" crunch, but the flavors were still rich. I liked the loroco in the pupusas and thought it added a nice \"green\" flavor. It reminded me a little of very mild broccoli rabe. The slaw (cabbage, carrot, and what seemed to be jalapeño) added a nice crunch and the sauce that comes with the pupusas has a great spicy kick!  The young woman who took care of me at El Arepazo y Pupuseria was very sweet and even entertained the questions I asked in my endless search for Colombian buñuelos. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try something a little different!"}
{"text":"For my first time not bad at all I might stop again. I ordered a sandwich it was really good but a little salty and empanadas were ok cheese didn't taste that good but beef wasn't that bad."}
{"text":"Comida latina auténtica y deliciosa. Entre pupusas y arepas, algo les encantará en el menú."}
{"text":"Im from columbus oh and i happen to be in cleveland this weekend and i got very exited when i saw a Colombian restaurant but i can honestly say this is the worst Colombian restaurant i have ever been to!!! I have ate in New York and last month in Chicago and they have been super good but this place is the worst!!!!! We got a bandeja paisa and Picada Colombiana and they are supposed to have steak and this is not steak and  it tasted old too!!! Oh and the empanadas are hard to eat since the pastry is hard. Im from Ecuador and i know how good Colombian food is suppose to taste and this is not how is suppose to taste. The bill was $50.40  waste of money!!"}
{"text":"This wonderful little place was a surprise to find on my yelp nearby places. I couldn't resist trying it out and really enjoyed my food! I'm Colombian, so you know I was being picky! It was a small place with big flavor and fresh food! Yummy! The prices are great and really cater to a full me up crowd. Needless to say, I would recommend it and come back myself next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Nice, quaint spot. Nice diversity for the west side. Super polite service and a little bit of everything on the menu. Delicioso!"}
