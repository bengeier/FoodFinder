{"text":"I came here with two friends and my girlfriend on a Sunday night a couple hours before closing. For a restaurant that had only six occupied tables including our own, the service was horrifyingly slow. It took 15 minutes for our miso soups to arrive, and another 20 minutes for three plates of sushi and a bento box to come. I asked how many rolls of dynamite rolls came in each bento and she said one. When it came, there were 8. Our waters were never refilled once for the hour or so that we'd been there. We waited for the server to attend to us once we were finished and give us the bill, which she never did. Instead, she avoided our table like the plague and attended to every table around us instead. It took three attempts to flag her down and it took 10 minutes for her to bring our bills, although we could all see her standing around, doing nothing. When it was time to pay, I had to do two separate transactions for my girlfriend because they couldn't put our bills together which didn't really bother me. I left her a 10% tip on each bill which I thought was too generous for being ignored by our incompetent server. 

Furthermore, our food was disgusting. We all received miso soups but my girlfriend ordered the bento and got a small bowl of soup with noodles that tasted like Mr. Noodles with spring onions. The miso had no taste whatsoever. The soya sauce was different, sweeter than the standard Kikko sauce, which did not go well with any of our sushi whatsoever. One friend and I ordered spider rolls and while I was impressed by the size of all of our portions, my excitement quickly diminished at the foods' tastes. Everything was sour. There was barely any crab in the roll, instead being filled 90% with rice. The dynamite rolls in the bento tasted sour too, and the shrimp had no taste. The pork cutlet, which I assumed would be served with katsu sauce, was drizzled with some sour brown sauce and, surprisingly, was not too bad. The gyozas were the best part of the meal and there were only two. 

All in all, I will not be returning. Ever."}
{"text":"Nice service, but the fish was not fresh at all"}
{"text":"The fish on all the nigiri sushi was paper-thin.  and lukewarm.  Just say no!"}
{"text":"I end up at Sushi Hana 3 or 4 times a year and it's always A-OK (as Yelp likes to describe a 3-star rating). The prices aren't the cheapest, the quality isn't the greatest, and the service is mediocre. On the other hand, I've had poorer quality sushi for more money elsewhere in the city.

Sushi Hana is consistently average. I don't seek it out, but I don't avoid it.

Note that at sushi places I pretty much only order rolls so my opinion is solely based on their maki offerings.

As for a recommendation, I enjoy the spicy salmon dynamite roll. The sushi pizza is decent too - thinner than most places so it's not as filling with a thin slice of salmon on each wedge."}

We found out this restaurant from Yelp. Although it has only a few reviews, we've decided to try it because we love Japanese food. Unfortunately, we made a mistake.

We went for a $25.50/person all-you-can-eat dinner. As soon as we stepped inside the restaurant, we smelled a very strong grease/oil smell. I guess it was from the deep-fried food. A lot of the sushi are limited to one order per person such as uni (ok), amaebi (ok, but super tiny), fresh scallop (good), white tuna (bad, no taste at all). And they no longer include the toro, which was very disappointed. All the deep-fried food like soft shell crab (the legs were ok, but the body did not cook well, still cold inside), the head of the amaebi (super tiny), and the agedashi tofu (taste arrrh...), did not taste good at all. Overall, the only \"eatable\" sushi were uni, hamachi, unagi, and fresh scallop.

I was disappointed with their food, but happy with their services. The waitresses were polite. Dessert was included, so we had green tea ice cream which was pretty good. I don't think I will come back here again though. I rather pay a little more and try the buffets in the strip."}
{"text":"The worst service we've ever had in Toronto. Drunk patrons and safety violations."}
{"text":"Mind-bogglingly slow service. Decent food. Will not visit again.

Eight of us showed up on a Wednesday night. The place was by no means full. We got seated and we let them know that we were waiting for two more. It took 15 minutes before they took our drink order. After 10 minutes, we got our drinks and gave our food order. Our two friends finally arrived, and they put another table on and another two seats (why didn't they give us the extra two when they knew they were coming?) Our food came about 20 minutes after we ordered it, which is kind of a long time for a sushi restaurant. We had to ask them for chopsticks, as there weren't any at our table. After that, we had to ask them for napkins. Since the last two people ordered after we had, their food came WAY after the rest of us had finished our food. At no point did anyone come by to ask if we needed refills of our beer, tea, water, or ask if the food was okay. All in all, we were there for two and a half hours, and we were by no means dawdling. We had plans to have a quick(ish) bite and head out to the bar. It was painful.

We noticed other diners were also not impressed by the service, particularly since everyone had to pay at the counter in an otherwise very nice looking restaurant.

The food itself was pretty good, but the lack of service really killed the place for me."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant about 7-8 times over the years and it's always been one of my favourites.
The waitresses tend to be young 20-something girls, so you don't expect them to stay there a long time, and in the past the service would be hit or miss depending on who the waitress was.
Today there was only one waitress, but I've never seen anyone move so quickly and efficiently, without having that 'I'm running a race' feel that you get at Chinese restaurants.
What amazes me is the value of their bento boxes.  For 12.95 I ordered a bulgogi bento box.  They give you a complimentary crunchy noodle soup, then a miso soup, bulgogi, salad, 8 pieces of a dynamite roll (which is usually 7.00 alone), 2 gyoza, and rice.  The qualtiy is very high - everything is always done well.
The only thing that didn't really work for me was the dessert, they gave you frozen grapes, which I've never had before.  

I can't understand why this restaurant is always empty.  While I wouldn't go specifically out of my way, whenever i'm in the Yonge/Bloor-Wellsley area, this is my go-to place.  
The waitress was the most capable one I have ever seen and should be commended 

What I also like is that the tables are spaced out nicely.  I don't enjoy sitting on top of people I don't know like at Japango, Yuzu, Wow Sushi or Guu.  I just want a quiet experience."}
{"text":"Soooo...I really really WANT to like this place.  I do.  The decor is cute.  The lunch specials are cheap.  The servers are amazingly nice.  

In fact, I was all set after my miso soup, and the first couple bites of my bento box to give this place a glowing review.  I don't even usually really like teriyaki, but this was doing the trick.  Good salad. Good dumplings.

But then...the california rolls...I do not know what happened there.  I do not know what happened at all.  There was some strange mayonaise-esque sauce involved.  But it wasn't like anything I've seen in sushi before.  Kind of sweet, mostly off-putting.  And those California rolls took me down a couple levels.

I may go back and try again, because the rest of the meal was great.  But I'm not sure how someone can mess up that essential part of cheap Japanese food."}
{"text":"Can't comment on the food, but the customer service from management is lousy.

I wanted to use AMEX (their reservation folds have the AMEX logo), but was told by the waitress they don't accept it. Hmmmm, so I debate the issue with the manager. He gets frustrated and FORCEFULLY pushes in a nearby chair out of frustration. (He also made a ridiculous excuse that because the place didn't buy the folds, that's why they don't accept AMEX.) Issue is escalated to the owner who lies by saying they do accept AMEX, but my card is faulty. Remember, both the waitress and manager just said they don't take it.

Not a big issue? But, what if AMEX is all I had? Completely reasonable to assume they accept it if they advertise the logo. My main gripe was how they handled the situation. Rude manager and fibbing owner.

Nothing wrong with my card, btw. Used it just before and after."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night when I needed a quick bite before going to a concert. I've been staring at it for months and was pleasantly surprised. The decor was modern and comfortable and the sushi was definitely the best in the neighbourhood with nice fresh fish that was neither chewy nor too cold. The avocado salad was also fresh and flavourful (although I would love to find a sushi place that doesn't use iceberg lettuce). The price was also very reasonable. I will definitely back and I hope others will check it out too so that it lasts longer than the last place!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good as was their soup but the waitress we had couldn't of cared less about us. She was totally inattentive and seemed to not care at all about serving us. We had to constantly ask for water, and once we were given our food she ignored us. She just seemed to really resent her job and was out to lunch mentally. I won't be back. What a disappointment because inside is really nice and they had nice candles."}
{"text":"Me and m BF were really hungry one night and stopped by here on a whim. The food is good and the atmoshpere is nice. We had Bipimbap which kinda reminded me of the Bipimbap we had in LA but still didnt compare. Its good for a quick bite if you need something quick and dont know what to eat lol"}
{"text":"I used to live walking distance from this sushi restaurant and have definitely had my fair share of all you can eat meals here.  Nothing to complain about, but nothing to write home about either.  Fair service, fair sushi, and a below average selection of rolls to choose from."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday before the long weekend with my girlfriend. The price for the specialty rolls were quite expensive, but the portions were nice. The food was fresh and tasty. Will come back."}
{"text":"Nice local sushi place with all you can eat. Nice attentive service with lots of selections. Not as many fancy rolls as some other places but everything was very fresh. Favorites were the rainbow roll, Tri-color, and anything with spicy tuna or smoked salmon. Finished with strawberry mochi. Can't get better than that.

Edit: Went back recently it seems like quality is falling in the Sushi Dept. Go figure, corners being cut on some items (lemons etc.)"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've never had any problem with the mayonnaise sauce. If you don't like the sauce, however, you can always ask them to put it seperately. :) The food their is delicious and the prices are reasonable. The decor of the restaurant is very relaxing and nice. I love coming with my boyfriend! He loves it just as much as I do. The service is good also. 
I go there all the time so I highly recommend it. :)"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I was able to gorge myself on sushi, and lucky me, I was able to this weekend.  After visiting two other sushi restaurants only to discover they were only doing a la carte, the BF and I decided to try out Sushi Hana.  

With its tinted front doors, you have no idea what you're getting yourself into until you open up.  Inside can appear daunting with his mint ice cream color paint and minimal decorations.  Upon entering, the sushi bar is laid out in front of you and to the left, while tables and chairs make up the right of the restaurant.  

Dinner buffet is $25.50/pp, while lunch is $19.95/pp.  Standard rules apply with no sharing among non-buffet eaters, no leftover rice, etc.  They limit you on your orders of Amaebi, Uni, and Toro, which most sushi buffets restaurants tend to do.  (It's a smart choice actually because we can easily eat a few hundred dollars worth of amaebi, uni, and toro.)  

The toro nigiri was so succulent!  It wasn't a grand piece in terms of size, but it was definitely good!  What a fabulous way to start our meal.  We were even surprised with our uni order, noting there was a bit more uni than we usually see at other restaurants.  The amaebi is standard, but I do love that sweet shrimp.  Don't forget to ask for the heads deep-fried too!  (Who doesn't love a little head?!)

Among the appetizer menu, we ordered some Agedashi Tofu, Soft-Shell Crab, and Seafood Poke.  The tofu came with four pieces and was lightly deep fried and how I like it.  The BF noted a strong ginger taste though, which I didn't seem to notice.  The crab came out in three pieces and was good too.  The BF was pleased that this restaurant offered it as an appetizer as other sushi buffets only offer it as a Spider Roll.  The poke was more like a seafood poke salad with the lettuce greens thrown in.  I could have passed on the salad greens, but I guess it kinda helps fill you up to.

We noticed on the \"Specials\" board a Kobe nigiri, which was also limited to one order per buffet diner.  Of course we had to get it.  It's a tender cut of beef that's rare.  The BF ate his all up and part of mine!  We also had Ikura, Hamachi nigiri, Hirame nigiri, and Negitoro.  The ikura and hamachi were standard, as well as the hirame.  (Hirame is just extraordinary in Peru for some odd reason, I can't quite find the same quality here!)  The negitoro came as a suggestion from the sushi chef, and it was a yummy piece.  We decided to pass on the rolls today, except for the lone Salmon Skin Roll the BF had to order.  It was generous roll with plenty of skin in it.  They also offered tempura, teriyaki, and other hot dishes.

Service was good, we didn't have to ask for our beverages to be refilled.  They actually came with a new glass of soda before the BF could finish his first, and he definitely appreciates this.  My water glass was filled too!  Dishes were cleared at a steady pace, often without me noticing.  

It was also nice to note that our sushi chef was Japanese as well as some of the waitresses.  Believe it or not, hearing dialogue in Japanese does give some creditability to the restaurant still.  

As our bellies got rounder, we decided to call for our check.  The waitress asked if we wanted any dessert, and we asked if it was included in the buffet and it was!  Yay!  (We had sadly noticed no dessert listed, so assumed there wasn't any.)  They had green tea ice cream, mochi ice cream, lychee sorbet, and plum sorbet.

Overall, we were pleased with our experience there.  Sure, they don't have a ridiculously huge menu with a million rolls, but we were happy with the quality of sushi we got, and that's what mattered.

They are open late - until 2 am! 

They also offer a frequent eater card - with ten visits, get one free!"}
{"text":"Sushi Hana is a good place to go to if you are craving some run-of-the-mill Japanese fair at CHEAP prices. The quality is good, especially for the money. The selection is average, but GREAT for the money, once again. The lunch specials are extremely affordable and although all-you-can-eat is priced the same as most other sushi places, you will actually be better off ordering separately and then it will be cheap for your wallet.  The decor is bleak, but the servers are super friendly. Few of them speak good English, but passible, they understand most simple phrases necessary. Service is super fast and the hours (until 2AM) are great for those who don't sleep early. Sushi Hana is definitely my stop when I am craving sushi at any time of the day/night, don't have much time and don't want to spend too much money."}
{"text":"The chef selection of roll was incredible I tried the black dragon roll, and fire! Hot damn..
The music...wow..its so delightful and very authentic The atmosphere was cool.
Meh i would go again but alot of choices in the city."}
{"text":"I don't finish work til 11pm most nights so this place is FANTASTIC!! An awesome sushi buffet open til 2am every night???!?!  Are you kidding me?!?! Raw shrimp?  Toro?   AWESOME.  They even have natto for the wife!"}
{"text":"I love their price on all you can eat sushi.. but I didn't get all you can eat this time. Because my bf didn't want to do all you can eat and in order for me to share my sushi I can't eat all you can eat. 
I ordered Uni and few other rolls and I have to say the Uni was fresh.. very impress with the roll also. I liked the Spicy Scallop roll also. I would love to go there again when I visit Vegas again."}
