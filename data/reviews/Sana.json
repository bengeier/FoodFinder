{"text":"I am from Pakistan and I know what good Pakistani food is and how should it taste. So take my word for it \"Sana is the best Pakistani restaurant in Canada\". I have been a regular since 2009 and I've sampled everything on the menu from Aloo Keema to Nihari to Seekh Kebabs and Haleem. Everything is delightfully delicious. If you are a first timer, try their \"Chicken Ginger\" with Nan and Mango Lassi with their Kheer as dessert, you won't regret it. Oh and I forgot the BBQ Fish Tikka that they do, try it with a paratha and you'll know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"One of the better Indian restaurants...  Butter chicken on point... naan ... mango lassi ... everything I tried was very good.."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Pakistani/ North Indian food in Montreal, this is the place. I could imagine getting the same food in Lahore! The haleem (lentils cooked with grains and meat) is amazing as is the Biryani rice. That said,  everything I've eaten here,  and I'm a regular, has been delicious! Including appetizers, desserts and breads... The ambience could definitely be improved, it feels like a canteen, but service is good and prices are very reasonable. Well worth a trip to jarry. They deliver also!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Pakistani food in North America! Place is crappy.. But the food is CRAZY!!"}
{"text":"There is effort here. The Nihari is stellar. As is the chicken sizzler Bhoti. the saag (spinach) is simply the best in town IMO. Nans are a  little dense but that's a good thing for all that heavy scooping. Halleem and Biryani are tasty but I usually go for white rice instead, easier to digest. Dhal Mash is good too.  Prices are very reasonable as are the portions. Decor is not so great but I just go there to eat. It reminds me of road side Dhabas along Goa Mumbai route. lighting is harsh and decor barebones. Their kulfi and Kheer are great.  I hope they don't change a thing, including the decor because it's a great experience."}
{"text":"Best Indian restaurant in Montreal.  I've been to many places, but Sana consistently delivers the tastiest food at the lowest price.   Their amazing naan is only $1 each and most of their main dishes are less than $9.  Tip: Get the butter chicken!"}
{"text":"Food arrived after 1 hour and 45m, cold and missing stuff. I called 3 times 1 hour apart and they say they'll send it but never do. Buncha crooks  Note: I tipped the driver 25% you'd think he'd have the decency to come back deliver a refund or the missing food"}
{"text":"Below average food. Tandoori chicken was roasted and then lightly based. The view if the restroom was undesirable.  Stay away."}
{"text":"Restau copieux très bon prix correct  Bon service par contre il y fait froid c'est le seul point négatif le reste est top je vous le recommande"}
{"text":"Sana is an Indian restaurant that appears to be a hole-in-the-wall, but if you know anything about Indian food you know these types are the best restaurants. While the decor is minimal and cleanliness skeptical, the food is unbeatable, and that is coming from an ethnic Indian person! I have recommended this restaurant to almost everyone I know and have not heard anything but good reviews. The food is absolutely fantastic, I wish they had one downtown!"}
{"text":"My parents love Sana's food. Any dish they make with lamb is pretty delish! We had lamb curry and naan, lamb biryani, and a lamb curry thali with 2 tandoori roti instead of naan and rice. The prices are good, $28 plus tip for all we ordered. Everything was good except the chana on my thali. The chana had no taste, texture, colour :( But since everything else was very good, it didn't bother me. The service was good. My dad likes to joke, our waiter was enthusiastically responsive. Over all it was a pleasant experience :)"}
{"text":"What a gem! Reasonably priced and as close as you can get to 'British Indian' food in Canada. The chicken tikka was great, as was the lamb curry, and garlic nan - succulent, delicious, tasty. Very modest in terms of decor, etc - the focus is on the food. Friendly, but no-nonsense, staff. My only regret is that it took about a year for me to find!"}
{"text":"I am all about great food for a reasonable price. The restaurant is ok nothing too fancy. The waiters are not very customer centered and it seems to be a family run place. There is a bollywood song channel playing in the background.     I came here for my bday and we ordered bhindi, butter chicken, and lamb sizzler. The food was delicious! There were two of us and we finished all the food! Ever since then, I have been comparing everything I eat to this place. I highly recommend it!   Overall: Pros: Food and Price OK....: Decor and waiter service"}
{"text":"Food is OK, but the service is poor. The waitress didn't know what tea they have available. They rounded up my bill to the next dollar, besides adding $2 for \"table service\", and (of course) took the tip too."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my lunch here...the thali plate (is that redundant to say?) for $5.99 was an amazing value. I joked with my lunch companion that \"sana\" in Kiswahili means \"very much\", and there was indeed very much food on my plate.  My vegetarian thali came with chana (chickpea curry), mixed vegetables, a tiny bit of salad, a huge mountain of basmati rice, and an entire naan bread all for me. My mixed veggie curry wasn't all that exciting, but the butter chicken I mooched from my friend was delicious, as were the chickpeas. Also, my lime juice drink was lovely and sour and tasted like real limes, not like limeade.  Very friendly and prompt service. I especially appreciated the jug of water that immediately appeared at our table on a very hot, sticky Montreal day.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Crappy decor , friendly service with a smile and the smell of 1001 spices!!!! Probably the cheapest and best  indian- pakistan dishes out there !!! The mung dhal and the eggplant dish were Outstanding....  Yes I will come again !"}
{"text":"First of all, it was very difficult to order by phone. The food took an hour and a half to arrive and was cold. There were bones in every meat dishes. I'm not sure if this is an authentic indian restaurant, but if you're looking for indian food don't go here. It's not the typical indian food \"format\" that you get at Bombay Mahal or Maison Indian Curry on Jean-Talon. I'd recommendd going there instead, althought, they do not deliver."}
{"text":"Tastiest Pakistani Halal Indian  food I've ever had in a long time. Their alou stuffed garlic naan with butter chicken is must have. Love their fish and chips with was marinated with Indian delicious spices.   I didn't like their mango lacchi which taste like cheap canned Indian lacchi you but from grocery stores. Their Lamb biriyani little spicy and have little smell; I didn't like overall taste.   Very good customer service. Good price is reasonable. Restaurant environment is ok."}
{"text":"I wouldn't change a thing about Sana's sketchy front façade because that would make longer wait times in what is already a hugely popular restaurant among local Pakistanis. I was the only non-South Asian patron when I entered the door and was immediately greeted with the scent of great spices (picture the air inside Pho Lien, except the aroma's authentic/no MSG). I took the Chicken Tikka Boti (grilled boneless chicken served on a sizzling plate) with their regular and whole wheat naans. The chunky pieces of chicken was so tender you could pull pieces off with a fork. The fumes from the sizzling aren't just for show - bite into the meat and the exquisite blend of spices brought out by the grill will overwhelm both in taste and aroma. It's a bit on the salty and piquant side and for the better, because what underlies the piquant is the aromatic spices of cumin and lemon marinade which puts American style spicy to shame. The breads were below average - the regular naan was fluffy but not crispy and tasted too much baking soda, and the whole wheat naan was almost a warm pita. They're only $0.99 a piece.  One of the reviews here sums it up pretty well: \"Hidden gem, small tiny place, with no customer service. BUT cheap, AMAZING food\"  Paid: $14 + tip (used a 15% RestoMontreal.ca coupon), they take debit Rating: 4/5 for now It's a sure repeat with a potential for a 5 star."}
{"text":"Uber eats did it again it struck gold.  What a great resto first time hearing about it and we really enjoyed it. Food came pretty quickly a little cold but it's Saturday night I get it.   Butter chicken was really good, a little kick to it but not to spicy. The chicken was shredded which was cool I've only had cubes before.   Will for sure be ordering with them again."}
{"text":"Soooo underwhelming! After moving from NYC to Montreal, I was excited to try Sana, what most colleagues and friends called the 'best Pakistani food in Montreal'. If this is the best the city has to offer, I'm anxious about my other options. :O  I ordered the nihari, butter chicken, and goat biryani. Everything hung on an equal level of bland and hum drum. The butter chicken was literally sweet, not something I was expecting or something I appreciated. The nihari meat was dry and tasteless and the broth left me feeling disappointed. I didn't even finish or pack my left overs!  Because I needed some dessert to mask the flavor of this tasteless food, I ordered some mithai (gulab jamun and barfi) which was average.  I heard that they updated the decor, and I was actually impressed with the ambiance. It was modern looking and didn't remind me of typical Pakistani American restaurants where you're hesitant to even use the restroom.  Overall, I wouldn't say the food was terrible- but I think I'll be able to finish my PhD in this city making my own Pakistani food."}
{"text":"C l'endroit préféré de mon mari et moi  quant on a envie de cuisine pakistanaise et indienne .  L'endroit est Propre la salle est acceptable les serveurs et serveuses accueillant sauf une fois ver la fin de service on nous a installé à une table mais personne n'est revenue un bon 1/4h !!!!! On avait même pas le menu ca ma énervé quant j'avais faim, mais  une fois que les plats sont arrivés je me suis calmé mais l'erreur est humaine  je vous conseille le poulet au beurre ( butter chicken) j'adore"}
{"text":"Ordered take-out from this place twice in the last week. The first time around, the food wasn't packaged properly - the items were flipped over in the bag. The food itself was passable. The second time around I ordered a Lahori chicken - much to my surprise, it was just a rotisserie chicken with a bunch of fries haphazardly thrown on top. Food was cold, and as before, flipped over with grease everywhere.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"4 of us had lunch delivered at work from Sana.  I usually go with the vegetarian options with Indian food and today was no exception.  I ordered the aloo ghobi (cauliflower, potatoes and spices) & saag paneer (spinach with cheese cubes).  Unfortunately they ran out of spinach and I couldn't replace with eggplant dish as they were out of that as well.  She suggested the lentil curry dish and I was happy she did.  Wow, it was nice and spicy and perfect for eating with a piece of naan bread.  All my colleagues loved their dishes and like that the spice level is on the high side.  This will definitely be on my list of top Indian restaurants in Montréal along with Pushap.  The samosas are huge and very generous for the price.  Delivery was about an hour and all our bills were lumped together in 1, so we were left to figure out who owed what even though I asked for separate bills.  Furthermore he didn't have change!  Cash only.  Despite this hickup, I'm looking forward to my next dish."}
{"text":"I had Chicken Biryani and Chicken Curry with Mango lassi at this place. The quantity was alright and the taste was pretty similar to a homemade Biryani, Chicken curry. I presume the ingredients are fresh and curry is not that spicy is sign of freshly prepared meal. Will not recommend Mango lassi from here. The service was fast and the price moderate.  Music was loud with some tracks from Bollywood 90s."}
{"text":"So delighted that Sana opened a second branch - in downtown Montreal itself. Yes it is a little off the beaten-path but hey, still way better than making the trip up to Jarry.  The husband and I are big fans of the restaurant. From the many Indian Pakistani restaurants in Montreal, this has to be one of our favourites due to the food being very authentic and of good quality.   Despite being a basement restaurant, it is neat and cosy with a nicer décor and ambiance than the original on Jarry. Though it was a busy Friday night when we went, the staff were all very polite and attentive. They seemed to be getting an endless amount of UberEats & JustEat orders - great for those cold winter nights.  We have tried most items from the menu but our favourites will always be the Channa Samosa (delicious!) for starters and Nihari, Haleem or Lamb Karahi. Nothing better than a good old spicy curry to warm you up in freezing temperatures and to end it all with a hot cup of chai (Indian tea with spices). Prices are very reasonable and they even offer Student Discount.   Highly recommend :)"}
{"text":"Visited Sana this evening for initially a bite but ended up having dinner! We had heard a lot of good reviews about this place and recommended by friends on many occasions so we thought we would finally try it out! From the outside it is nothing fancy - you could easily walk past without even noticing it! But once you step inside, you are overwhelmed by the delicious aromas of various spices and grills that fill the cosy and homely interior. It is a simple place but we felt very welcomed and comfortable as the waiters were very hospitable. We ordered the famous samosa chana chaat, nihari, naan and roti. Everything was cooked to perfection, the flavours were just delicious! I am a super big fan of samosa chaat and they did it just right! The nihari was also a good decent portion - a lot for one person so two could even share it! They even give complimentary salad and homemade mint sauce with the meal which was a bonus! The stone baked naan and roti were also very good. Our order arrived very quickly despite there being many people. Overall, we were extremely impressed with the food and also the price! It is definitely a lot more affordable than most indian restaurants and also better taste wise too!"}
{"text":"Wow... This was quite possibly one of the most underwhelming meals I've had. I ordered the samosas and palak paneer with naan to go on the side. The samosas were okay, but definitely not the best I've had and were more on the average side. The palak paneer, however, was very sour (like one of the other customers mentioned). As a result, when I ran out of naan and there were no more pieces of paneer left, I had hardly any desire to finish it or take it home. I traveled quite a bit to try out the food here, but I can safely say that I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Go there for two things: hands down the best butter chicken and chick peas channa in Montreal. Get the 6$ thali with butter chicken that comes with a naan, huge portion of rice and salad for an incredible value."}
{"text":"the best indian food ever, so yum, must try the chicken masala, the prices are amazing try going on monday were they have the most discounted food,, the naan is amazing too"}
{"text":"Hidden gem, small tiny place, with no customer service. BUT cheap, AMAZING food and HUGE portions!!!  I can't emphasize enough about the price, portion and quality of food. Go, try and then thank me later."}
{"text":"Given Sana's cheap sign and tacky décor, you wouldn't necessarily expect quality food from this halal, Punjabi/Pakistani restaurant. But when I first arrived at Sana the feeling that I struck gold hit as soon as I looked around and noticed the place bustling with other Indian people. Indians who would choose to eat out over eating at home?? Dang, this place must be good.  Sana was recommended to me by \"Bob,\" a Pakistani green grocer who's a bit of a legend on the city's Parc Avenue. Basically, locals know to trust his wise opinion, me included. When I go out for Indian, my expectations are usually low because the best Indian food is home-cooked. For a cuisine that is traditionally healthy and flavorful, even the recommended Indian restaurants are often junk food style'y, cutting corners wherever they can i.e.) substituting oil for butter, reducing cooking time, sacrificing flavor for portion size, etc. But Sana is home-cookery at its best: simple recipes, made with fresh ingredients.   The pakoras and samosas have the right ratio of potato to herbs and spice. I always get the dahl - perfect for sharing. The saag-paneer is the bomb - I recommend having it with naan rather than rice. The naan isn't as quite pillowy-thick and chewy as it often is elsewhere, so you're able to eat more of it without getting full too fast. I usually don't do butter chicken but Sana's is cooked just right. The only dish I don't love is the biryani - it's a tad bit on the bland side. Order a side of raiita (yogurt with cucumber) to cleanse the palette. The mango lassi's good; the chai tea isn't robust enough (but that may be a regional way of brewing it), and the gulab juman and  barfi dessert are yummy town if you don't mind embracing cavities!  People complain about the service, but I come here for an awesome meal under $10, not affection. If anything, the lack of care from the staff is kind of entertaining because it seems unintentional rather than deliberately rude.   After having tried all the other listed Indian restaurants in the city, Sana is the only one I would recommend, and I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Great Pakistani place and nice that it's downtown.    I'm a big fan of Chicken Achar and Sana makes a great one.   I'll add more to this as I try more dishes.   But the chicken was so good I had to post early."}
{"text":"My Pakistani friend brought me here. It's a bit out of town -- 30 minutes of bus ride from McGill (#80). Otherwise, the food is superb! My friend and I ordered the grilled chicken, naan, saag, and lime juice. The price was reasonably cheap -- we paid around 40 cad."}
{"text":"Of all the restaurants, Pakistani and otherwise, that I have visited, Sana is the overwhelming champion. The humble decor belies the unfailingly exceptional food. Even the simple desserts, such as a nut ice cream in a paper cone, were packed with flavor. You can lay down a ten-dollar bill and still eat like British Royalty. The goat curries were my personal favorites, but try anything from butter chicken to bitter melon (and I do mean bitter) and you won't be disappointed. I would come back here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"its a small indian restaurant.. nothing fancy.. Just eat and go. Good price! Good food.. Okay service.. The food was okay! I hate it when they clean the table where they  bring out the big bucket and while everyone is eat. Kinda gross."}
{"text":"I don't know how to write about Sana without involuntarily salivating excessively, so I'll keep this brief.  If you like Indian food, but don't mind them on a little bit spicier side (or not, just avoid the spicy ones). If you don't mind medium speed service or needing to transfer to a bus after the metro to get there, then this is hands down, the most mouth-watering indian/pakistani restaurent in town.  And it's comparatively much more affordable too and generous portioning."}
{"text":"Same delicious food, now with a fresh coat of paint.  The grilled plate is delicious and so is anything else you can point to on the menu. The naans aren't what I would like them to be, but it's serviceable for dipping.  They recently renovated, making the place a little more lively and clean."}
{"text":"This is my friend Noah's favourite place in all the land and you know what, he's pretty much right. The staff is funny and charming, the room is mellow and unfancy, and the chicken thali is massive and crazy delicious. There probably is no better deal in town for under ten bucks. My friend ordered the vegetarian and this was a bit of a disappointment to be honest, kinda tasteless compared to the bangin delight of the butter chicken. But the naan and lentils were still perfect and pleasing, and we had sour fresh lime juice that made the muggy outside world fade from memory just long enough for us to feel floaty and happy, and very lucky to be lunching at Sana on Jarry. Go!"}
{"text":"BBQ meat plater is the only thing that is good here. Otherwise palak paneer was sour, Chana was flavorless. Waiter over sold dishes which held no overall value for the money. Restaurant has no atmosphere, horrible service. Outdated tables, washroom was dirty.  I'd recommend trying other places. Went here because of the reviews sadly never again."}
{"text":"It doesn't look like much from the outside, so what a surprise!  Their lamb thali was very well made, simple and delicious.  You get to choose from one of their vegetables dishes: mixes veggies, spinach, chickpeas, etc."}
{"text":"Cheap good and quick, not a date restaurant but definately a tasty one, i had nihari, very soft meat in a spicy sauce ! I love going there when i am in the area ! Quick, cheap and yummy in my tummy"}
{"text":"OK so we were in Canada for three nights. We were traveling from Maine through Montreal to  Toronto. We ate at several restaurants and have to say this was our favorite. The quality of the food was outstanding. The Nihari was incredible.  Thie  flavors of all the dishes were unique and rich.  This was the type of restaurant when you know you're eating authentic regional food from Pakistan cooked by folks who know how to do it the right way. The ambience was also uniquely authentic to an ethnic restaurant  located in a multicultural western location. If you want  to have the perfect dinner, in the perfect location, and the perfect climate, but the perfect waiter... Stay at the hotel have a drink at the bar and eat there. If you want some authentic food from deeply authentic people in the really cool   Authentic neighborhood then try Sana."}
{"text":"Not too big of a fan here...environment is pretty crappy but food is as good as it gets. Everyone else in the family is a huge fan of this place so go fig. A good place to try out for fast service and desi food :)"}
{"text":"This is the first time we've been to Sana. The neighborhood is pretty dispirited. However, the inside is pretty clean and spacious.  We had samosa for starter. Mixed grill and lamb karahi as main courses. The dessert was home made Kulfi, traditional Indian ice cream. I like all the dishes. The samosa came with a sauce which is quite flavorful. The grilled dish offered 3 different meats. The karahi is medium spicy to my taste but probably the most spicy dish there. The Indian spices married with flavor of lamb, the curry is so rich and intense flavored. It goes very well with rice and naan. The frozen dairy dessert Kulfi was a surprise. We both enjoyed it.   The prices is inexpensive. Main course varies from 9 to 11$. I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"Food was great and reasonably priced. Service was great. Glad to have found an authentic Indian restaurant during our stay in Montréal!"}
{"text":"Ne vous fiez pas aux apparences. Sans l'application et les avis, je ne serais jamais rentré dans ce resto. Avec ma compagne, nous avons vraiment très très bien mangé et copieusement. Le service est très agréable, nous avons un peu attendu nos plats, cependant cela est généralement signe de préparation minute. Tout était très frais. Je n'ai pas encore reçu l'addition, toutefois les prix sur la carte sont très chers.  Pour synthétiser allez y les yeux fermés !"}
{"text":"Food is very average. Was delivered cold for the most part, and taste is very disappointing. I don't understand why this place has good reviews. Bombay Mahal is much better!"}
{"text":"Hope i could give 0 stars, i ordered naan and they delivered frozen naan by heating them in the oven i suppose, charging $1.50 per each. So i never ordered again and will never ever reccomend to anybody( the one 's u get at any indian or even other stores, in frozen section or pre packed found in bread section)"}
{"text":"We chose Sana based on the many positive reviews. We were encouraged by the number of people from East Asian cultures also eating at the restaurant. The samosas were good and filling, sauce that came with them was awesome. I had chicken thali (chose butter chicken and mixed veg) tasted more like chicken cooked in tomato soup with frozen veg mix is spices! I was super disappointed in the meal. My wife had lamb thali with spinach. The cuts of meat had multiple bone fragments and the spinach was mush! The spices were good in her meal. We hoped for the ice cream - all out, booo! The staff were like maniac squirrels running around, the new guy (I felt sorry for him) was not getting any guidance about what to do to help with the busy evening. Not going back, sorry!"}
{"text":"Best Indian/Pakistani food in the city, simply amazing. Chicken Tikka Bina, Sag Paneer, Lentil Curry dish and Alou Gobi, Salty Lassi - all amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This is an average indian restaurant in my opinion. Plenty of others having better to offer. Lamb biryani was very salty with too much food coloring (not talking about the turmeric), but the Jalfrezi chicken was good and so were the sweets."}
