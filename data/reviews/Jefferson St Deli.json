{"text":"Friendly staff, great food, reasonable prices, chill environment to be in. My favorite place to be in waxhaw"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. I'm always on the hunt for a good, local sandwich place.  The fresh-baked focaccia on my Italian was a fantastic, unexpected touch.  My wife really enjoyed her roast beef as well; both sandwiches were huge, and we had to save half each for later.  Creative, great quality, nice folks, everything I want from a local deli. In a world of chain restaurants, I'm glad these guys are here. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Both times we've eaten Jefferson St Deli it has been to go, so I will say that the food is good size for a fair price. What we've had there has been worth it and it will become a fairly regular spot for us now that we have relocated."}
{"text":"Food is a little pricey but decent. My biggest complaint was the cleanliness. The floors had not been swept or mopped in a while. And while the staff was friendly, the owner is not."}
{"text":"Great value, great food, great service. I had the Sunset sandwich with the softest focaccia bread I've ever tasted. The avocado was perfect and it was big enough that I took half home. My husband had the Santa Fe salad and it was huge and delicious. We will definitely come and would absolutely recommend it."}
{"text":"Best Italian sandwich I've ever had! Staff was friendly and the place was very clean. Great selections and the sandwich is huge and a great value. Highly recommend!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fries were good, tuna was ok. Came in about 45 min before closing. Food was delivered in take out box then they started putting chairs on tables. Felt like they wanted me to leave. Red headed guy was pleasant bonus!"}
{"text":"A must to try. I have had the Miami and the southern lane. Big on taste and big on helpings. The sandwiches I've had have been delicious."}
{"text":"The workers are always very friendly. The food is consistently good. It's a great sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Visited this deli for the first time. The Miami was awesome. My son got the ham and cheese. The bread was good. The ingredients were all fresh.  Will be back here again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a high priced \"gas station like\" deli with unfriendly customer service, then this is for you. Go next door to the grocery store and get a much better quality deli sandwich. This place won't last long in Waxhaw.   I would like to add that one of the workers was extremely rude and made anti Semitic remarks because I asked for rye bread. He said, \"we do NOT have Jewish rye\". Good god....."}
{"text":"What a great find! We happened upon this deli by accident and we're pleasantly surprised. The food was wholesome, fast, and delicious. Prices were spot-on too. Everything was seasoned to perfection. Flavors just danced in your mouth. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed!"}
