{"text":"Fantastic food, laid-back atmosphere.   All around a wonderful Sunday morning brunch experience!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service. Lovely brunch, and I'm amazed this place usually has no wait. The cinnamon rolls are divine."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful brunch this morning.  Bloody Mary was interesting, lots of fun stuff in it.  Had steak and eggs, the chive hollandaise sauce was perfect.  A cinnamon roll for desert... WOW...  The warm Irish sweater coffee is to die for.  Cozy atmosphere.. Great service...  An all around perfect experience! Give Oliver's a chance... You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, fantastic food, fabulous beverage options!  I am looking forward to coming back to try other dinner options as the menu was very impressive."}
{"text":"If you appreciate fresh quality food, this is the best restaurant in Madison.   Love this place for cocktails and dinner. Great fish dishes and cheese pairings. Also enjoyed brunch. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I thought the cocktails were excellent. The staff was friendly and knowledgable. The food was great. I had a full course dinner. The ricotta fritters were sweet and savory. My tagliatelle was spicy and cooked al dente. Churros were good for not being in Mexico.   I read other reviews and one person said they wished they had cheaper options like a burger. But do we really need more of that in Madison? I'm glad the price point was where it was. And happy to not see another burger and standard bar food. We have enough low quality bar food out there.   I'd go again. So happy to have something good on the west side."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Quality food. Quality service. Absolutely delicious. Good ambiance and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was the worst place I have ever been. The bartender was racist and sexually aggressive towards my wife. I have never been so publicly humiliated. If you have any respect for humankind you will never go here. I have never posted anything online before and created a yelp account solely for the purpose of alerting people to this abomination of a business."}
{"text":"Dinner for 4 last night. Halibut, trout, steak, and pork tenderloin over gnocchi for mains, salads and green gazpacho for starters. All dishes fresh and nicely prepared, with lively flavor profiles that highlighted the core components. One of the best meals ever in the Madison area."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced for what it is, and it seems like they're trying too hard to make the food fancy and it isn't working.  If they stuck to more traditional recipes and increased the portion size, it might justify the cost.  But until then, I'll eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Limited menu but great food and nice selection of beer and unique cocktails. Liked dinner so much we went back the next day for lunch."}
{"text":"Ricky was an excellent bar tender. Amazing veggie Benedict! Delicious bloodys. Was fun to see all the craft cocktails being created. Great food for the costs! Recommend this place to anyone who loves brunch :-)"}
{"text":"Solid all the way around. Big fan of the burger and beet salad. Nice lunch spot if you happen to be by the university hospital. They serve real coke (out of a glass bottle with real sugar) if you're into that kind of thing too."}
{"text":"This was our first time visiting Oliver's Public House. The atmosphere is very nice, the decor is very welcoming. It's definitely on the smaller side, but not too crowded that it's uncomfortable. There was a group of six of us and we all ordered different items. I ordered the Pan fried trout which I thought was delicious. The portions were small and pricey, my husband ordered the $19 Pappardelle and ate it in 4 bites. I will admit it was quite small. The drinks were good, but again very pricey. The service was very slow, I ordered a drink and didn't get it until after our bill had been received. I think there are a few kinks to work out, but I am not sure the food was good enough to warrant another visit."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beers and other creative cocktails! The food is outstanding; favorites being the salmon, whitefish and amazing tomahawk pork chop! Crazy good glaze and seasonings. The staff handled our special occasion celebration flawlessly and helped make the night perfect!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my brunch at Oliver's.  As a person who only opportunisticly eats meat, I tried the veggie benny which was made with mushroom \"bacon\".   I quiet liked it and the housemade english muffin was nice and sour.  My girlfriend had the veggie BLT which was less exciting with no tomatoes, but gets around that by including sun dried tomato aioli - not my thing...  The bread it was served on was excellent, however.  The side salads were good as well.    So, my bloody mary was strange, but uniquely great.  Not sure what they're doing, but it was boozy and flavorful - excellent, really.  Comes with spicy green bean, olive, celery,  and part of a meat stick though...so I ate it."}
{"text":"Really great lunch!! Had world traveler relatives with me, and they live their meals. Potato trout soup was yummy. We had the bison burger, green goddess salad, three been salad, bluegill sandwich, and they were all great. Ian did a fine job waiting on us, even being new to the food service profession. We will be back, sure to be a highlight of our monthly doctor visits."}
{"text":"We went there for a weekday dinner to celebrate our anniversary and absolutely LOVED it! The waiter was extremely patient and really nice. Ambience was very romantic for us. Food was hands down delicious!!! A little pricey for entrees but that is expected.  The waiter asked the chef for all necessary info that he didnt have and the chef obliged without problem! Overall lovely experience from food to service!"}
{"text":"Had brunch for the first time here yesterday. It wasn't too crowded and we were able to get a spot at the bar right away. We split the Belgian Beer Waffles and Willie's omelet. Usually I'm not a sweet person when it comes to breakfast foods, but the waffles were so good! Very light and fluffy with the flavor combos of both dishes being pretty phenomenal. Also had to try the mimosas which definitely didn't disappoint. The bartender was knowledgeable and attentive. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was really excited for Oliver's to open but was pretty disappointed when I ate there on their opening night. I had read that Oliver's price point was supposed to fall between nearby Lombardino's ($$$) and Blue Moon ($$), and was pretty shocked when I saw that most main courses were actually in the $18-$30 range. I ordered one of the less expensive dishes, the macaroni, and found it to be a little burnt. When I ordered the macaroni, the waitress asked me \"would you like a soup or salad with that?\" so I requested the soup, assuming that it was included in my dish - I was then shocked to find that an $8 charge for soup was included in my bill. I thought that this was pretty misleading.   On the pro side, the soup, bread appetizer, and cocktails were really good. But again, they were a little too expensive (minus the bread, which was complimentary). I really really hope that Oliver's lowers their prices or adds some cheaper dishes (e.g. burgers and sandwiches). The neighborhood is mostly medical students and residents, and in my opinion, a menu and price point similar to The Old Fashioned would fare much, much better."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch and it was really good.  I had one of their Anna's  omelettes and my husband tried their veggie benedict and both were really good. Coffee hit the spot as well!  I would love to go back for dinner and try that as well!"}
{"text":"We celebrated our anniversary at Oliver's Public House and couldn't have asked for a more perfect evening. From the awesome service to the exceptional food, Olive's did not disappoint. We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"We love Oliver's. We have been there several times for brunch , lunch and dinner.  Great food with unique  tastes.  Staff are always very friendly and attentive. Love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"If you've eaten dinner at a number of decent restaurants in Madison you will be disappointed at Oliver's.  If your meat is good the portions will be too small. If you order something that sounds delicious they will have run out of it. If you order a drink it will take longer than you expect. If your server strikes up a conversation with you it will be a little weird. If you want your date's attention you won't get it because the room is too loud. Not sure what exactly it will be in your case, but something will definitely go wrong.  My hot coffee was cool, my beer glass was dirty, my carrot tasted freezer-burned, the beer I ordered first (from the chalkboard list, not the printed list) was gone (and I was simply served a different beer at first...seemed like an honest mistake though), the table we were offered first was the worst of the two available, my boring 38 dollar steak was a few strips that could fit in my palm and one of them was all gristle. A few stale, crispy onion shavings didn't help.  My wife had pretty good salmon, and a nicely roasted, though completely unadorned, piece of broccoli. Her (yummy) beet salad had so few beets that I thought she got served the wrong thing.  We felt like the meal should have been priced around $60 or $70, but it was $110 (there are many better restaurants at that price).  Not a horrible place. Just not good enough for dinner. Sounds like the brunch is better(?)."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a late Sunday brunch and wasn't disappointed.  The atmosphere is nice: calm and casual, not at all presumptuous.  The '90s soft rock playing was kind of silly but also kind of charming. I really liked the large bar; we generally prefer to sit at the bar and chat with the bartenders.    The food though, was amazing.  I had the biscuits and gravy, and the boyfriend had the corned beef hash and they were both very, very good.  The gravy was a brat gravy, and the meat wasn't overwhelming.  The hash was mashed potatoes and had rutabaga and some other sweet additions that gave it a great taste.  Both were large portions.  Also got to try a cinnamon roll - I don't even care much for cinnamon rolls but it was ridiculously good.    In talking to the bartender and one of the owners who happened to be there, we learned they source their food locally and menus change frequently based on what they can buy.  Granted, there are a lot of places like that in Madison, but it's something that I appreciate, especially when the food also tastes so good.  It's been on our list to try but we never get passed Lombardino's which is an all time favorite.  Brunch was so good though that now we can't wait to try it out for dinner!  The lack of a wait was nice, but I hope more people discover this place and give it a try. The food was fantastic, so I really hope they can make it!"}
{"text":"Overall: great food and good drink menu  We were excited to try this newer restaurant. The second we walked in we knew that the atmosphere was perfect for us. Even through we went to dinner at 6p on a Thursday, their dinning room was already pretty full. We didn't mind taking a table in the bar next to the full length windows. My husband was impressed with the beer list and wished he had spent more time looking at the liquor list. Our waiter was very kind and polite. We decided to go for the monkfish and steak. They were amazingly done. The steak was savory and mouth watering. The monkfish was light but rich and the same time. To top it off we ordered the chocolate cake which was rich and heavenly.   We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, friendly atmosphere,  great cocktail and beer menu. The food is amazing. Do. Not. Miss."}
{"text":"We had a beautiful experience here. Our waiter was extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. The food was mostly local, organic and delicious! Definitely coming back next time we visit Madison!"}
{"text":"Have been there twice and can already tell this will be a regular happy hour stop to meet friends.  Great service and atmosphere, and the space is REALLY beautiful.  Favorites are the scallops, tagliatelle with sweet corn and smoked mushrooms, and the pork shoulder.   Despite what another commenter said I thought the wine list was exceptional and had some really reasonable prices on some great bottles. And obviously the cocktail menu is something that sets Oliver's apart from almost any other restaurant in Madison.  On my second visit the bartender said they rent parking space from some neighboring businesses for customer use, make sure you look that up on their website if you prefer not to park on the street."}
{"text":"Great service, nice location, terrific bar! Good place to go for a night out or family dinner.  They keep the menu fresh. Parking can be a challenge."}
{"text":"I was really excited for Olivers to open, as it's within walking distance of our house and seemed like it would be a great addition to Lombardinos and Blue Moon. It's very warm and welcoming, and our waitress was really nice. However, I thought it was very overpriced for what you get. The food was pretty good (the bread was excellent), but there are many, many other places in Madison I'd prefer to go for a $25 entree. I was really hoping Oliver's would have a great sandwich/entree combo menu that restaurants on the near west side seem to do so well, but sadly the less expensive option is completely missing from their menu.  Also, their wine menu is small, unexciting, and super overpriced. There were only a handful of options for less than $9-10, which would be OK if any of the options were a bit unusual. Unfortunately, almost every wine on the menu was one I routinely see at the grocery store and could buy a bottle for the same price (or less) than a glass at Olivers. A plus side was the cocktails were interesting and really good!"}
{"text":"Healthy food, good size portions (not too much)!  Went for 2nd time: tried churros again, this time was deep fried! I think it would be better to fry the dough a bit less. The espresso ice cream was very good! I also had cappuccino, which was awesome!  Went for 3rd time: smoked trout omelette; very good! Loved the side salad; very fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, very busy. Over priced, small portions. Left hungry even after having appetizers (not even enough for a mouse), and entree and dessert!!! Had to drink a lot of water to feel full and refrain from devouring our neighboring table's meal.  Easy on the stomach, harsh on the wallet!"}
{"text":"Cute restaurant with high and low tables. Clean and organized bar, which is refreshing as they make a wide variety of cocktails and non-alcoholic drinks. Bloody Mary's are smokey and made spicy, taste as delicious as the sausage garnish. We had two orders of frites with our brunch. The plates were smaller than your normal Wisconsin brunch plate. However, each dish was creative, fresh and flavorful. Breakfast steak was a good cut and correctly cooked to order. Brisket hash was hearty and delicious. We tried the Belgian beer waffles and thought they needed work. What looks like whipped cream is actually a more savory/sour cream topping. Additionally, the bananas were a bit too sweet and the pairing was slightly off. Waffle itself tasted great. Fantastic bread made in house, but no gluten substitutes. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I read reviews indicating \"Trendy\", but was greeted by a very sterile atmosphere that reminded me of my grandmother's 1970 living room.  The service matched the atmosphere as well.  The staff was very aloof and seemed like they wanted to be anywhere but there. That could explain the number of empty tables at the height of the dinner hour (only 1/3 of the tables were occupied). Looking past the atmosphere, I hoped the food lived up to the 4 stars but was disappointed again.  It took a good 40 minutes to our food...with a restaurant only 1/3 occupied. My steak was burnt on the ends, medium ion the outside and raw, not rare, but chewy raw on the inside. I should be thankful for the burnt ends as they were the only part that had any flavor. The buckwheat crepes were a disturbing grey color that my friend said had no flavor.   Save your money and hop across the street to the Blue Moon Bar and Grill which has much better food and great service.."}
{"text":"Went on Tues evening during resturant week. There were 4 of us. All of us had an excellent meal. The service was excellent asking in a timely manner about drinks all the way through the meal of 3 courses. The food was brought out as we finished a course. The place was very busy. We did have early reservations. The only problem that could be is parking. We were able to get a spot in a nearby parking lot. The streets were full and everything is 2 hour parking."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Tuesday night. Even thought the place was basically empty our drinks took a ridiculously long time to arrive. Server never offered us drink refills even though we were there for over 2 hours. Food was way overpriced and mediocre at best. Huge disappointment overall."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Drinks and food were both amazing and the service was perfect. Attentive but laid back and left you alone to eat your food. Try the Milwaukee Breakfast, Bloody Mary, and Irish Sweater for drinks and the Biscuits & Brat Gravy, Steak & Eggs, and Veggy Benny for food."}
{"text":"We came here seeing this place had pretty good reviews. We went for lunch. The drinks were alright. And the soup had some good flavor we ordered the chicken sliders but what I noticed when they came both my girlfriends \"squishy buns\" were pretty dark and the buns I had one light and one dark. Ate the light one first which was my house as how it should be... \"squishy\". But when it came time to eat the second of my sliders I could barely bite through this one. I assume my girlfriend had the same issue. I confronted our waitress about this and she let the manager and kitchen crew know of this. The manager never came and talked to us but I assume talked to the kitchen. About ten minutes later he confronted and apologized, but seemed like he didn't care. I found that the manager not even talking to us about the issue a little distasteful in management. It was nice to take a drink off our tab but that wasn't the issue. The food was absolutely horrible for the both of us and only take one drink off our bill. Take a drink off, not the food because it's cheaper? Not like our bill wasn't already high enough at $65 for lunch. Could have been handled a little more professionally."}
{"text":"I really liked the vibe of this place and was excited to finally give it a try. I  had the pan roasted trout and the beet and rye berry salad. The trout dish was not bad (but still pretty underwhelming and unimpressive). But the beet and rye berry salad was simply... B.A.D.... I didn't understand it at all. I'm generally not a picky eater, and I enjoy most salads, but this one.. I couldn't even get myeslf to finish it. Spinach, beets, mushrooms, and the rye berries-- these are all earthy ingredients. Why would anyone think its a good idea to put those ingredients together, and sell it for 8 dollars? soft mushy spinach, soft mushy beets, soft mushy mushrooms.. Everything had the same texture and the same flavor.  I mean OK maybe the rye berry added a bit of a crunch/diff texture to the dish, but flavor-wise it added nothing. Yeah, the beets were pickled but it did not add nearly enough acid to counteract all the earthy bland flavors. The vinaigrette was also more oily than vinegar-y. I really felt that this salad was incomprehensible. It just felt like something you force yourself to eat because its healthy and not at all something you would eat for enjoyment. Maybe I don't have a sophisticated enough palette to appreciate the subtleties of this dish, but my experience was bad enough that I will not be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great and love the decor. It's so nice to have another good quality neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Atmosphere = A+ Waitstaff = A Drinks = A Food = A Food for the price = Meh  Oliver's is a great place to drink, super friendly staff, good cocktails and awesome vibe. However, I'd only go there to eat again if Tempest, Cento and Tornado were an hour or more wait.   The food is very good but is way too expensive for the end product. If I'm spending close to $100 for two people in Madison, I want a more high-end experience. Totally fair pricing if we were in Chicago, but we aren't."}
{"text":"We hit up Oliver's for brunch regularly- probably once or twice a month. Always meant to try their dinner menu, and as I'm a sucker for a good Friday night fish fry, we ventured over there last Friday night to sample their take on it.  I'm sorry to report that dinner simply does not compare (at all!) to the fabulous brunches we've experienced there. The third star on this review is a nod to their brunch because if based solely on dinner this would have been a two star review at best.  My fish fry was covered in a mushy (not crisp) breading and it was 4 very small pieces of skin-on perch- slimy, overly fishy, and a tiny portion in relation to the price.  I did like the coleslaw that accompanied, and they were nice about subbing in some tasty brussels sprouts for the potatoes... but there was an upcharge on an already-$18 fish fry for the veggies, arguably the best part of the meal but not worth spending almost $20 on a fish fry.  My boyfriend's burger came slathered in their \"secret sauce.\" Based on the rest of the menu description (two beef patties, pickles, cheese, etc) we were thinking maybe it was supposed to be Thousand Island dressing... but it certainly didn't taste like it.  It tasted bizarre and not in a good way. Almost like pickled onions mixed with blue cheese? Had a chalky consistency as well.  My boyfriend couldn't even finish his burger.  I thought maybe I'd try it since I was still hungry- but the flavor was just off.  It tasted gamey.  And the meat was way overcooked.    We spent too much money to leave hungry.  Sorry, Oliver's, but we'll probably stick to brunch."}
{"text":"Meh. Drinks are very good.  But the food is overpriced and not great. My date ordered the steak, which was very heavily marinated. The fries were super greasy and over salted.  I ordered the cornish hen, which I couldn't finish. It was really small, super greasy and had no flavor. It came with these really bland shredded potatoes that were also greasy, even though they said that they were baked. We spent $80 on a meal and we weren't very satisfied.   I would not come here to eat. But I would come back for a drink."}
{"text":"Olivers never lets me down! They have a great atmosphere, locally sourced menu, and delicious cocktails. I would highly recommend choose a cheese board with a variety of cheeses (you choose), and a \"Oaxappens in Oaxaca\" tequila cocktail. It's a great place for dinner or happy hour!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. We've had both lunch and dinner here and were blown away by the meals. Can't wait to go back. Loved the seared scallop and shrimp appetizer as well as the cucumber gazpacho. This place is one of the best kept secrets in Madison."}
{"text":"A MUST TRY!  Lunch, Dinner or Brunch! I stumbled upon Oliver's last summer and have been back several times.  Friendly staff, warm and contemporary setting and last but not least a  imaginative menu that has brought us back again & again.  I love the atmosphere...young, old and every age in between make it lively but not overwhelming.  I'm from Chicago and travel a lot for business so suffice it to say I get out a fair amount, Oliver's ranks among my all time favorites! During our last visit, my enthusiasm caught the attention of our waiter and got us a visit from the Executive Chef himself, Patrick McCormick. He is as warm and charming as his restaurant.  Prices are incredibly reasonable and the quality is without question. I love the farm to table values of Oliver's without any of the pretentiousness you commonly find in such an AMAZING restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this more stars...I love the farm to table concept, fresh ingredients, and interesting food at Oliver's, however... This is probably the loudest restaurant I've ever been in.  My head still hurts.  I had to shout across the table at my dinner companion.   We ordered a few starters and enjoyed them, but the entree was terrible.  Shrimp/scallops that were cold, and served on luke-warm greens that were so tough we couldn't even eat them. Maybe we'll go back and try brunch when the weather is better and sit outside where we could hear ourselves think."}
{"text":"Slow service and small, overpriced dinner portions. My husband refuses to go back even though it is so convenient to where we live. Nice outdoor seating area and a decent brunch menu."}
{"text":"As a VA hospital employee, I am ecstatic to have a close, decent place (that takes credit cards) to wind down with my co-workers.  The atmosphere is warm, inviting and clean; the staff attentive, knowledgable and pleasant.  A perfect hangout much needed in the area!!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian it was nice to see some effort put into the veg dishes.  In many places there are salads and cheese dishes  which just seem to be an afterthought.  So I was delightfully surprised to see that on a very small menu that there were 3 entrees for vegs!!  We went with the crapes and were very happy.  Plus the staff was simply wonderful.  Our hostess was also a veg and shared with us that she made the butter.  Which I must say tastes more like frosting then butter!  Simply wonderful.  Oh, and the bread!  Yum!  It went very well with the squash soup."}
{"text":"We arrived at Oliver's on Friday evening around 5PM, just as they were opening for dinner.  The atmosphere was modern and elegant, the kind of place you go for a festive evening meal.  We were greeted warmly by our server.  He was helpful during the whole meal, but we never felt any hovering.  We ordered drinks, and when they arrived, we ordered the beet salad, the buckwheat crepes, and the Cornish hen.  Service was prompt, and we found all the food beautifully presented and delicious.  The beet salad was especially yummy, with a variety of beets and greens in a sweet vinaigrette.  The crepes were tasty and unique with a squash purée and roasted brussel sprouts.  It sounds odd, but tasted very good.  We shared everything, including the hen.  The half bird was sitting on what tasted like a large potato pancake.  We found the bird about what one would expect considering the portion size, price, and quality of the entree.     As we finished off the meal by sharing the bread pudding (reminded us both of a thick French Toast with a serving of sorbet), the bar area started to fill up.  A couple even sat down there with their newborn.  The clientele was a mix of young folks looking for a drink after work, and couples looking for an elegant meal.  This is a place we will keep in mind for future special occasions out."}
{"text":"Nice place for weekday lunch, they have a small menu and concentrate on doing those items well ! A nice Smokey bloody Mary. The OPH burger was good and the fries were great! A small parking lot was nearby for easy parking."}
{"text":"This place is our consistent go-to spot for a nice dinner out where we know everyone is going to enjoy their food. No worries about someone being disappointed here - all the dinner entrees we've tried have been great. Oliver's can definitely compete with the downtown restaurants despite their more off-the beaten path location. They do accept reservations with the exception of their outdoor seating which is first-come first-served.  There are two vegetarian entrees, the buckwheat crepes ($14) are my favorite. The veggies are fresh, not overly cooked and not overly greasy (win win). The mister loves the mac n' cheese (I can confirm, it is quite good) and is also a super fan of the pan roasted trout. We normally have stuck to beer (they've got a nice selection) but the cocktail list also looks great. My teetotaler friend (she is expecting) was super excited to find a non-alcoholic list of craft cocktails that she could enjoy as well.       With excellent food and consistently good service, this is a place I'm happy to go with out-of-town folks because I know everyone will leave having enjoyed the experience. No risk here, and that's a good thing."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch this morning. My mimosa was not good, I couldn't finish it. It had no fizz at all. I ordered the biscuits and brat gravy. The biscuits were so dry and tasteless. My side salad was almost not dressed at all and I only took one bite because it was basically plain spring mix. I really enjoyed the hash browns and my server was great. However, this was just not a good experience for me. I have had positive experiences here in the past."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely love this place for lunch! (Have not been here for dinner yet).  Stopped in after a doctor visit at UW Hospital as its right around the block from the best western (within walking distance).  The food was delicious and the service was really good too!"}
{"text":"I arrived at Oliver's quite skeptical... A review of their website had turned up a 14 dollar \"children's pre fixe,\" which struck me as crazy and fussy. But we left the kids at home and had a lovely meal. (I think now that might be a ploy to keep the numbers of kids low, which is fine!)   The cocktail menu is a delight to read, with inventive twists on standards. The beer selection is very solid.  All our dishes were delightful. My porkchop entrée was absolutely delicious. A dining companion was pleased with the trout. Another dinner found the salmon special to be a little overly acidic.   I want to make special mention of how wonderful the service was. Our waiter was familiar and confident with the food and drink menus. He looped by the vicinity of the table to see if we needed anything but never once interrupted the flow of our conversation. That is so incredibly rare these days.   Oliver, you won me over. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We came here when it first opened to check it out and grab some drinks, and we liked it! It had great potential. Then we came back for dinner and brunch where we had the same server. The dinner menu and brunch menu both seemed to be experimental trying to go for the pricier feel. It was a fine experience, but there were kitchen issues and the waitress gave a bunch of excuses and tried to cover it up with her friendliness and service (doing her job, of course). Honestly though, it didn't cover it up for me very well. This all happened months ago, when they first opened. Then, we came back for brunch today and noticed that the menu had changed quite a bit. I got the roast beef sandwich with a salad and my friend go the classic benedict. Overall, the food was all tasty, but I wasn't super impressed with either dish. I'm usually not a big fan of ham, but the ham on the benedict was pretty good (thin, tender, not too salty). I'm happy that they serve Colectivo coffee too. :) I thought the waitress' service was decent today, but it was a bit slow (when the restaurant wasn't very busy)."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit and would recommend it for anyone who enjoys a great meal with out the \"downtown\" pricing. Greats drinks, beet salad and oh ya Scallops, shrimp and grits!! Yummy"}
{"text":"I also had an opportunity to visit Oliver's for brunch, but the experience was not quite the same. I highly recommend the delicious cinnamon roll, but advise against the smoked salmon bagel until the dry salmon debris is replaced with something edible. Also, Oliver's served old, stale fries as side dishes to two people in our party, for which there's just no excuse. Too bad, given my great first impression."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now, and have been impressed with the service, the food, and the awesome Old University cocktail (do yourself a favor and order up a couple of those). We were there on a very busy Friday night, and the bar waiter (I believe his name was Guillermo) was wonderful. He made our perched-at-a-bistro-table dinner feel special and fun.   It's perhaps a little pricey for the setting. But really, the food was delicious, the service was perfect, and have I mentioned the Old University cocktail?"}
{"text":"Yum! I took my friend here for lunch on her birthday during a spring time snowstorm! Three cocktails and two lunches will run you $56 so be prepared for that. It was worth every penny, everything was SO WONDERFUL! I had the grilled cheese on focaccia  with homemade tomato soup, my friend had a OPH burger with greens. We tried the 1931 cocktail  and another delicious one that had vodka, guava, strawberry shrub and grapefruit?! Anyway it was awesome! I hope to return soon!"}
{"text":"High hopes but was disappointed overall. Place looks great inside and out. Service was meh. Food was overpriced for the quality and portions too small. Salmon overcooked, pork chop and gnocchi tasted charred. Uninspired all around. Much better restaurants to drop $100 at in Madison."}
{"text":"I finally came back here to try their dinner service for my birthday. Besides one hiccup, my boyfriend and I enjoyed our meal.   I ordered the Oaxappens in Oaxaca, which I had tried before so knew that I liked it. It's perfectly sweet and spicy. For our appetizer we ordered a trio of cheeses recommended by our waiter. I loved all of them, and my boyfriend especially enjoyed the Bleu. It was served with poached pears which complemented it really well. I also LOVED the bandaged cheddar combined with an apple compote. They were served with some crisp crackers. It was really, really delicious.   Now comes the hiccup. My boyfriend ordered the Mac n Cheese...it was honestly gross. The noodles were too thick, sauce tasted like nothing, and I'm not sure who enjoys turkey in their mac. We really hated it. There was no essence of cheese anywhere in the dish. However we mentioned it to our waiter and he happily brought my boyfriend another entree, the steak. Now the steak. Holy crap what a delicious meal. That is something we would come back for. I also loved the Buckwheat Crepe I ordered. The succotash was full of brussel sprouts, asparagus and red onion, and it combined with the mascarpone into a fork full of yumminess. I would return to have it over and over again!  So, had the steak and crepe dish not been so good, this review would have 2 less stars. However Oliver's redeemed themselves after a disastrous mac attempt. I'll be back to try the Brunch!"}
{"text":"I've met my cocktail soulmate and it is Oliver's Public House. Oh, I order cocktails sometimes. But I almost never really like them. Too sweet, too bitter, too watery, too boozy... there's always something off.  But not at Oliver's! I had the Monkey Gland and FINALLY get what people are talking about when they strive for \"balanced\" cocktails. Ah, you mean I don't take a sip, make a face and grimace at the thought of another sip? Novel cocktail concept indeed.  The bar was also made of some fascinating and shiny material.  The food was okay. But I'll go back to see if my cocktail eureka was for real."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and dessert on a week night. I love the atmosphere here! Trendy but not pretentious , clean,comfy, relaxing, and laid back with good lighting. Service was great; since I am very specific about my drink and dessert, both times when we order our waiter had to inquire more information for me from the bartender and chef, I appreciate him being so attentive. I couldn't be more happy having warm Irish coffee, flourless chocolate cake with double chocolate ice cream. The space is nice that it offers outdoor sitting,regular tables, bar area and also for more intimate settings there are tall stools against the wall for smaller parties. It was a great time!"}
{"text":"Good cocktail menu; nothing in the near west side area does nice drinks so we're excited to have it in the neighborhood. Nice decor. Food was good (tagliatelle and Cornish game hen). Staff is certainly new; they were polite and all but reading from a script and walking past our table a bunch without a glance and generally feeling stiff. I'd go back for food or drinks. Improved service or a signature food item would bump up my rating."}
{"text":"Best atmosphere great drinks very slow night but my simple order which included a sausage didn't come until 10 minutes after my daughter's and then was not that good.  Some parts were good others not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch. No surprise - truly excellent. The veggie omelette has some awesome red pepper.  And ohhhh the cocktails. This really is by far one of our best new restaurants."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with a friend. It wasn't very crowded though I found the acoustics such that it was difficult to carry on a conversation sitting across the table from one another.  I had the beet salad with chicken added. It's presentation was very nice though the taste was nothing special. My friend had the Caesar Chicken sandwich. The house bun it came on appeared to be a homemade ciabatta roll that was hard and difficult to bite thru; she ended up eating it open face with a knife and fork. The chips were plentiful and tasty."}
{"text":"Recommended by FB friends when I asked for suggestions. I would also recommend this place too.   Easy parking on the street and I think there's also parking off to the side. Staff are very friendly and nice. Everyone helps out. Nice place for a meet and not noisy at all. No decor and settings.   Food was good. Soup du jour was delicious! The tuna bruschetta was good in taste and ok in presentation. It is basically everything as described on a toasted slice of bread. I didn't know how to eat it. Without cutting, things fell off the bread unless I held it horizontally to eat. I also have a small mouth.   I made the error to cut it into fours. The bread is only hard around the edges. The center is very soft and everything fell onto the plate. :-( tip - fold it in half and open up the mouth.  I had expected bruschetta as small pieces of toasted bread slices with stuff on top. That would have made this dish perfect!  Everything tasted good, even the coffee. Not salty with balanced taste, I.e. Nothing over powering the other.   Nicely done!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Oliver's last night. I had the Tagliatelle which was so fresh tasting and nicely prepared. Service was prompt and offered with a smile. The Potosi Lager on tap was a nice complement to my meal and although a bit loud the atmosphere was stylish and warm. There is no doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends who were all excited to try this place!  As we walked in and took a seat at the nearly empty bar, we were immediately greeted with an obvious harshness. Feeling as though we weren't really wanted at the bar, we quickly sat at a table, again, in a nearly empty restaurant.  Our table ordered a gamut of apps - frites, all the meats and several cheeses, which also came with pretzels! This was an interesting twist I had never seen before and while all the rest was delicious, the pretzels failed.  For dinner, the ribeye, pork shoulder, risotto and scallops and shrimp w/grits were all ordered, along with another app, the risotto fritters.  After what seemed like a long time to be waiting for dinner, our food arrived. Everyone agreed that mostly everything was tasty (other than the shrimp - four people ordered that dish and all agreed they were awful), however, extremely salty. I was surprised at how heavy handed they were with salting the dishes. About half way through our meal we realized we never received the fritters, figured she'd forgotten about them, and just went on with dinner. Shortly after, they arrived. They are doughy and sweet and just not good. We were at a table of 8 people with 4 fritters and they weren't finished, if that gives you any clue.  We decided on sharing a dessert of churros and ice cream. A few minutes after ordering, our server came over and gave us our checks. Since we never received our dessert we made sure to check the bills, and one of us was charged. When asked about it, she said it was still coming. I've never felt so rushed to get out of a restaurant that, at this point, was only about 1/2 full. I also thought it was awkward that she would bring our bills but not ever mention that dessert was still coming. And when it came, we had to flag her down to get silverware since she had taken all of it when she cleared the plates. We didn't even finish the churros because they looked like they were uncooked in the middle.  All in all, I think my friend said it best with, \"this isn't a place I would need to return\"."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Love the service, food, cocktails.  I have been twice, once with family and once for work dinner.    It is similar to Lomardinos in price, and very worth it.  I agree I would like to see the menu expanded to include gourmet sandwiches, and I hope this happens when they expand their hours to lunchtime.   This is a great addition to near west Madison dining and cocktails/happy hour!    If you're looking for burgers and beer go to the Blue Moon across the street."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place is rated so low, the food was fantastic. Way better than some of the places downtown. Had the trout and a fabulous cocktail. Great intimate ambiance."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now - all for drinks and appetizers and each time has been great.  Love the atmosphere, drinks, food etc.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood - can't wait to go again next weekend."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had Oliver ' s Valentines Day Prix Fixe menu. Service and cocktails were 5 stars, food ranged from 2 to 3 stars unfortunately.  The food was OK, definitely not bad, but for the price I expected more. The crab appetizer (kind of like crab fritters), we're good. The Wild Rice cakes with duck ragu, while creative,  sounded much better than they tasted. The Brisket entrée was hearty and solid, and probably my favorite dish of the night. The monkfish, while covered in delicious sauces, was over cooked and chewy. For desserts,  also a mixed bag. The chocolate cake was delicious,  this is probably the only thing I would order again. However,  the financier (a small cake) with apples, was really, really dry and completely underwhelming.   I am definitely not giving up on Olivers,  as I feel it is headed in the right direction.  I just hope they figure out what they do well and let go of what they don't do well."}
{"text":"I really want to like Oliver's, but something always seems to be a little off (either with the food or service). There is a creative, entreatingly named list of non-alcholoic cocktails. The menu is relatively small, atmosphere is fine (if a little dark), but it feels like everything feels a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"We had another great experience at Oliver's. The seasonal comfort food was perfect for a cold night. My partner had the brussel sprouts, farrow and lardon salad and the beef cheeks entree. I had sweet potato soup and mac and cheese. We shared the apple fritters with caramel ice cream (made on site). Each dish was spot on and delicious. Our server was informative, attentive and friendly. Oliver's keeps getting better each time we dine there."}
{"text":"Perfect, and I do mean PERFECT eggs during Saturday brunch. I had the Willi's omelette, with delicious mushrooms, Hollandaise sauce and oven roasted, herbed potatoes. I've never had mushrooms so flavorful, and I like the way they thinly cut the roasted potatoes.  We found easy parking because Oliver's has rented the lot at the former Import Auto Clinic.  No trouble finding a table and had wonderful service.  We attended a Yelp! Elite event here on St. Pat's and it was off the charts great. Couldn't wait to return for brunch, and so glad we did."}
{"text":"I was disappointed but maybe I should blame Yelp for the high reviews. After further review, I should have notice they were focused on the brunch not dinner.  I had the whitefish and it was awful.  Also, I didn't appreciate the waiter trying to overdo it with recommending drinks. Too much talking and interrupted us numerous times for no reason. The place was pretty empty for a Saturday night so I hate to feel rushed unless people are waiting on a table. So we left to have a drink somewhere else instead.                    But I had to give it 2 stars since my wife actually enjoyed her meal."}
{"text":"Olivers Public House started out promising, as a lunch date with my wife. There was one other table of four in the restaurant when we arrived. Our drink order was taken by the waiter almost immediately. He took our food order about ten minutes later. In all, it took us about 35 minutes to get our food. This struck me as odd on a Monday, at lunch time (12:30 pm).  My wife was pleased with her bison burger (cooked medium well), served with ample greens as the side. She found her food good; but, the vinaigrette coating her greens was mostly vinegar with some salt.   I had my Reuben made special: no Russian dressing, add aioli. The Reuben was advertised to be pastrami served on house-prepared rye. The pastrami was corned beef, which would be the most disappointing thing, if there had been more than two ounces of meat on a sandwich that was about 16 square inches in size. However, the distinct lack of sandwich filling, combined with the fact that the filling was not as advertised, made this sandwich singularly disappointing for me. The bread was taste-free. My side, the chips, were decent.   Prices were disappointing, making me wish I had stuck with my original suggestion to go across the street."}
{"text":"Ate there a handful of times during Oliver's early days. I was seriously turned off by inedible crepes, grease hardened fish fry, and doughball gnocchis. Cocktails were also annoyingly amiss. Seems like taste and skillful cooking got lost in the menu and aspiring ambiance. Hope leadership evens it out."}
{"text":"The dinner descriptions say BLAH WAH WAH but flavor says YAAASSS MAMA!!!    Even the pork chop knocked my socks off! I don't know about you, but I think pork chops are usually pretty sad and dull and meh.  Think Merchant quality when you think cocktails. The signature list is strong - a bit on the sweet side for me, but the bar staff is on point and ready to mix up something different and exactly to your liking.   The decor is classy and the atmosphere is chill. I've never had to wait for a table. The servers are friendly and they might bust your (pork) chops just a bit."}
{"text":"In one word: meh. Service and atmosphere was fine, but the menu is rather small and some prices are larger. That works at some places in town, but it means every bite needs to knock it out of the park. My boyfriend and I shared the scallop app and the shrimp app, both were good and pretty huge for appetizers. We then shared the crepe, which was bland. The thing is, at this price point, there are better places with more menu choices in Madison. If we ever came back it would be for their eclectic wine selection, and we would just stick with apps."}
{"text":"I wasn't especially impressed by Oliver's. The french onion soup with burnt. The beet salad was missing soul. The restaurant was pretty empty. The reuben was good and the mocktails are pretty cool, but overall, I was really disappointed with the whole experience. Service was ok. I definitely would not be interested in returning."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch this week with my mom and I really enjoyed it! Our server was extremely attentive and the service was quick. I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The bread was the perfect amount of crunch and the tomato soup had vegetables mixed in (which pleasantly surprised me). My mother ordered the Oph burger and really enjoyed that as well. The prices are a little expensive, but the food is delicious. Although I came during lunch, it is worth noting that they have happy hour specials throughout the week. I will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"Liked this place a ton. Went with friends for brunch.  I first noticed the lack of a 90 minute wait, like most places in downtown madison, and the warm and cozy feeling of the interior due to all the wood decor.  The sun lit up the place, the collectivo coffee rocked, and my breakfast Sandwich was served with... thick cut bacon!!! Awesome! They've got vegetarian options, twists on classics, biscuits and brat gravy come on, various forms of eggs benedict and about 6 things you'll want to try all at once.  The service was happy and at just the right place, they let us chat about for and couple of hours and never rushed us. I will be back to try their dinner options as well as the bar, in the near future."}
{"text":"Heirloom tomato and cucumber special with sour cream dill and feta with garlic panko crumbs was excellent.  We had the seared scallops and shrimp and asked the scallops to be cooked through and they were perfect.   Cooked yet not dried out.  Ended with the rhubarb strawberry crisp with homemade ice- cream.   Ate outdoors,  our waitstaff, Clara was very attentive, and was warm and friendly.   All in all a very good dining experience."}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to an already impressive food scene in Madison.  I was home in Wisconsin for the holidays and decided to visit Oliver's Public House with my husband and some family.  The atmosphere is clean and modern but also capture's a very warm feeling.  I loved the large black and white farming print on the walls, it went so well with what this place is all about.  We started at the bar.  My husband had straight bourbon, of course, I know he enjoyed it.  I tried their house old fashioned and really liked it.  It was different than the \"Wisconsin Style\" old fashioned I'm used to; it was very light and refreshing, something you could drink in the summer and as well as winter.  When we took to our table we were greeted by our waiter with home made bread and the most delicious butter ever.  Our server gave us their run down on how the restaurant works.  A true farm to table experience, everything is made in house, down to the bread, butter, sausage you name it.  They do all their butchering in the back on site.  I noticed a few comments about the prices, but people need to understand this is why, lot's of work goes into these meals, more than what other restaurants can say.  Back to the bread: the bread was so fresh and unbelievably soft.  The butter was laced with honey to give it a hint of sweetness and we couldn't get enough of it.  For our starters we ordered the ricotta fritters and the sausage du jour.  The fritters were good, though not what I was expecting.  There little fluff balls of cheese instead of the pancake style.  They were good, but I thought the sausage was way better.  Again, made in house it was packed full of flavor, was nice and juicy and didn't have any unsettling fatty bites that sometimes sausage can have.  For dinner I had the Cornish hen,  it was baked very well, nice and tender and the veggies and potatoes it sat on were delicious.  The sauce it all sat in was my favorite.  My husband ordered the steak, and it was absolutely delicious.  Very tender, cooked to perfection, he loved it.  The steak comes with a \"pound\" of fries, which is needless to say, a lot.  But with the whole table munching on them because they are so delicious, you're going to need a lot.  We really enjoyed our visit, the atmosphere is so nice, the food was fantastic and the service was wonderful.  The bartender was the nicest guy, he was so patient with my extremely indecisive aunt.  Our server was awesome, he explained everything on the menu and the objective of the restaurant so well.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Tried Oliver's because my husband found it listed on some \"Hottest Restaurants in Madison\" list. I was quite impressed with the service and quality of the food.  Our server was great, personable and attentive.  The farm-to-table concept is a favorite of mine since I don't like the idea of food being highly processed and/or traveling long distances. We enjoyed the flatbread pizza as an appetizer, salmon and steak for entrees, and the churro dessert. Those churros were GOOD!  The flatbread pizza was slightly overcooked (or possibly overbroiled) as the broccoli pieces on the pizza were completely black. Other than this, the flatbread was very tasty.  I am not clear on what I should wear at Oliver's? I went to Oliver's wearing black pants, boots and a tailored blazer. But other people there had on dirty tennis shoes and t-shirts with holes. So I don't know if I was very overdressed or if the others were very underdressed?  I must admit that I've been more impressed by other restaurants in Madison, but all in all, I was quite happy with my experience and would recommend dinner at Oliver's."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal at a cool looking place. We made advance reservations for a large group and came to find only one server for the whole place. Maybe that should've been a tip off that at lunchtime there was only one server.  Predictably, ordering and receiving the food was a slow process.  I ordered the house burger which was a decent sized burger served on a tiny bun. It came with fries that were way over-cooked.  The burger was OK. The fries were terrible. Another one of our party got the bison burger, which looked a little bit better than the house burger.   Also, another one of our folks ordered A side order of french fries and they weren't over-cooked...Lucky her!  2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Would definitely go back here. Had a rustic/trendy feel to it. The crowd is a bit older, more university folks. I went Sunday around brunch time. They sat us right away even though it was quite busy. the drink (thyme and lime) was really good! Brunch menu is unique and satisfying. I would definitely go back here!"}
{"text":"Each time I have been here I am disappointed. This time I was with a group of six and we were all were annoyed with the food and service. To start off they offer a homemade tonic that goes with a gin and tonic that was terrible. I was warned by the waitress that it is \"different\" and it was. There is ginger in it among other things that ruined the gin and started the evening off with a bad taste in my mouth.The tomahawk pork chop which comes with a long bone attached to it was excellent. The others that were with me complained about the dry  un-interesting burger and a noodle dish that my wife thought was tasteless and didn't eat it.(our server ignored uneaten dish)The waitress that served us was not very attentive and looked like she would prefer to be somewhere else. The drinks were very slow in coming as it was the first time we were here. (Maybe they need two bartenders or a faster one.) The noise level is as bad as the first time but at least there was no music playing to make it worse. I think they try hard here to make things really different but unfortunately they go too far and ruin the taste of things like a gin and tonic. Not my favorite place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have a tradition of getting a sitter for Christmas shopping and dinner. We look forward to it every year. This year, I was thinking about all of the local shops we wanted to hit, and wanted to go to a new Madisonian restaurant. I've been intrigued with Oliver's, as I work nearby. We arrived at 5:30, to find a lovely, cozy place with literally no guests. Imagine our dismay when the host walked us past dozens of empty tables to a 2-top by the kitchen and bussing station. There literally were no other guests at the time. Not a great first impression and we asked to be moved. The waitress was lovely - savvy, smart and well informed. Menu is quite limited, but I prefer that since the quality is often better. We had the nightly sausage appetizer, pork shoulder and crepes. It was good - not great. Returned the sausage to kitchen because it was cold. They brought a new one. Hoping that as this new place gets up and running, they work out the kinks. I'd love to bring my team here for dinner but am not quite ready to pull the trigger on that yet."}
{"text":"I thought Oliver's Public House was excellent. The food was fantastic (I got the smoked trout omelet with roasted potatoes and small side salad) - Oliver's creatively and expertly uses top notch local ingredients. I loved the light hollandaise sauce with the omelet. Overall, the meal was delicious, but not too heavy, and I feel that a person on any diet could find something fantastic to eat here. They offer Colectivo coffee, which is also generally good quality and brewed well.  The restaurant itself feels extremely classy yet still casual, with trendy design elements.The little details here make a big atmospheric difference: the French-cafe-reminiscent water bottles on each table, minimalist white teacups, and marble bathroom accents, etc.   Personally, I am already looking forward to my next visit. This restaurant is perfect for brunch and great for warming up with good food a cold fall day."}
{"text":"BEST. BREAKFAST. SANDWICH. EVER.  Your choice of bacon, ham or portobello  \"bacon\" plus one perfectly cooked sunny side up egg plus the most delicious garlic aioli ever plus your choice of cheddar, Swiss or brick. I had the bacon and cheddar and whoa, drrrroooooolllll. Delicious to the max. I've never had so much bacon included on a bfast sammie before! There had to been 5-6 slices. Swoon. Plus it was some of the highest quality bacon I've ever had. It comes with your choice of potatoes or salad. The salad was fresh.   This was my first stop in and I will definitely be back. Homemade pastries, Collectivo coffee and Radiohead (even the obscure stuff) playing in the background. Friendly waitstaff. What's not to love?!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent.  I had the buckwheat crepes which were amazing especially if you like brussel sprouts!  My table also ordered and raved about the scallops and grits and the pork!  The bar menu seemed like it was carefully picked as I had a hard time deciding between the excellent beer, wine, and cocktail choices!  The tap menu was very reasonably priced.  They have really cool tables that can be easily transformed from a 4 top to a 6 top at the drop of the hat which makes it easy to meet / not meet some of your most flakey friends!  The atmosphere is very nice and it is nestled in a very neat neighborhood.  Parking can be an issue, however, since it is in such a nice residential area it's not impossible to find a close FREE spot!   The bar is a nice wrap around and plenty of options for seating!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to a neighborhood bereft of any nice restaurants or bars, but a few kinks still need to be worked out.   The cocktails are reasonably priced and creative, but most non-classics end of being far too sweet. A friend ordered a rye-based drink in which the citrus was more forward than any smoke from the whiskey. The manahattans are good, but again a bit on the sweet side. Spirit selection is great here, however, so that (or beer) may be the way to go.   The food is interesting. Totally fine overall, but nothing noteworthy. I agree that the entrees seem a bit overpriced, though the appetizers aren't bad. Some of the best things we had were the ricotta fritters and cheese plate, both of which had a great honey drizzled over them. But I ordered the mussels and clams as a main and was genuinely puzzled to find what looked like patatas bravas dumped on top of the middle of the dish. Yep -- mayo and (undercooked) potatoes right in the middle of what was otherwise a delicious dish (sauce was great!). Hopefully, the menu gets simplified and the chef sticks with simple but good dishes rather than complicated and lackluster ones."}
{"text":"Somewhat disappointed after finally checking out Oliver's and have a fairly \"meh\" experience. After waiting at the entrance for five minutes and trying to locate  someone who might seat us, we flagged a waiter who came by and showed us to the table. (We figured out later that the hostess was chatting at the bar with her back to the door.) The waitress was friendly and prompt, but the food itself disappointed. When the fish fry arrived at the time I almost asked, \"where's the fish?\" because it was scarce on the plate, vastly outnumbered by potatoes and slaw. My boyfriend's clams and mussels were similarly lackluster, with a musky sauce that didn't match up to similar fare at Brasserie V or Graze. Why was the patio packed, and the bar similarly so, we wondered? Maybe there's a Star Bar phenomenon where people who live in the building form the basis for the clientele. Going to give it another try and hoping next time will be more successful."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I was initially concerned. Everything has animal meat and I am a vegetarian. But when I ordered the flat bread with out the ham, they not only accommodated my request but offered to add other veggies in exchange. It was a very pleasant surprise. Many places hate substitutions... The flat bread was also delicious. The crust was obviously handmade and was thin and crispy but still had a really nice chew to it. The staff was awesome and the drink list has solid variety."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a classic case of \"They Almost Got It Right\"  The atmosphere is really nice, but it is very loud...they almost got it right We went for the brunch, which offers both breakfast and lunch items. My wife and I both thought the smoked salmon with chive cream cheese on a bagel sounded good, so my wife orders that and the waitress says they are out of cream cheese!?! Are you kidding me, we are in Wisconsin, The Cheese State, with Cheese Heads, that make, buy, sell and eat loads of cheese everyday...send your bar back down the street to the Whole Foods Store and buy a dang container of cream cheese. They offered her a garlic aioli as replacement and it was just ok...they almost go it right. I ordered the roast beef sandwich, the description sounded good, it came on the plate and looked good, hoagie-like bun, with cheese, and stacked with lots of roast beef, lots of over-salted roast beef, like way over-salted roast beef, almost-couldn't-enjoy-it-over-salted roast beef...they almost got it right.    I looked on the drink menu and they had an eclectic mix of nice sounding drinks. It was around noonish, so a Bloody Mary was sounding good, but I looked at the price $8 seemed a little steep, since there was a \"call\" vodka in the description, I said I'll just have a rail bloody. When the bill comes the bloody is still $8. Every bar in the world charges like an extra dollar or two for called spirits, and less for cheap rail spirits, except Oliver's. The host informed me that the cost of the bloody comes from \"the labor of making the spicy mix\"...HA HA HA HA. Are you kidding me? You are kidding me right? No...they almost got it right. $40+ for lunch? save your money and time, go across the street to the Blue Moon, get a good old burger and a rail bloody, then pocket your other twenty and think to your self \"Hey, they got it right\""}
{"text":"I enjoyed the drinks and cheese plate; the atmosphere is lovely. I would never pay that much for Mac & cheese again, I loved the idea of poached pear in the dish however there could be much more done about a cheese flavor and texture in the dish. The churro does not have a particularly good taste, however the espresso ice cream it is paired with was absolutely delicious, and possibly the best part of the meal. I sampled a bite of the steak, not to my liking, which in my opinion came with an over-abundance of tasteless, boring, yet- crispy fries. The Pear of Aces drink was well made and delicious. Complimentary bread, which was good as well. Overall, I would definitely go in for drinks and MAYBE an appetizer, but I would never specifically choose to eat a meal there again."}
{"text":"We came here for a happy hour snack. We got two macha teas (which were delicious) and a selection of meat and cheese. The meat and cheese came with bread and crackers, respectively, which was a pleasant surprise. Each dish had a garnish to accompany it (mustard for the meat, special sauces for each cheese). We loved both selections, however, we were expecting there to be a larger sample for each cheese. All in all, a pleasant experience and we were forward to trying the dinner menu, which looked wonderful."}
{"text":"0 for 8.  Nothing was terrible. All was odd. It's restaurant week so tons of time to get your best foot forward.  The patio setting was non descript. The waitress was plastique. The service was adequate but a bit \" off kilter\".  The food. Our 2 first dishes, main courses and deserts - all 6 - were a \" this flavor combo doesn't quite work\" result. Hard to go 0-6 in anything.  Two days earlier we had another Restaurant Week first time experience at Heritage Tavern and that was 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"It's great to have a nice place in the neighborhood.   The decor is very professionally done and it looks like a fabulous place for a date or nice night out.  I met some clients at the bar where we had drinks. I found the service at the bar professional, but somewhat ambivalent in attitude. I don't want to be fawned over, but I do expect staff at a place like this to be a little more engaged and present. The selection of tap beers was short, but nice.  Afterward, that same night, I met another client there for dinner. The service was good and the menu looked great. My guests all enjoyed their food. One had a large dinner salad, another had the buckwheat crepes, a third had the grass-fed steak and I had the Cornish hen, which the wait person had recommended because it was a family recipe. The presentation and appearance of all of our dinners was excellent. The flavors in my Cornish hen and the sides were delicious. What I am in shock over is the portion and the price. The menu states \"Cornish hen\", it is $23 and there is no mention of the portion. It was not a full Cornish hen. It was not a half Cornish hen. It was a 1/4 Cornish hen. One very small leg connected to one very small thigh. That's it. I've seen more meat in an average size chicken strip.  I will try Oliver's again, but will be more careful when I order."}
{"text":"Had a lovely solo lunch outside. Attentive but non-intrusive wait staff, nice ambiance, luscious eggs Benedict with wildly fresh salad. Short walk from Frank Lloyd Wright Unitarian Universalist church-- 10:30 your plus stroll to restaurant = great morning!"}
{"text":"This is my husband and my go-to spot for when we want to go out and not feel terribly icky after eating out without spending a ton. We like their burger (the sauce is a different consistency but the flavor is good and the housemade pickles are excellent), the pimento cheese (lovely - my family is from the Mississippi delta, and pimento cheese is a big deal - would recommend the pretzels with it), most of the happy hour food menu, and every.single.cocktail. The bartenders here are fabulous!! We like the churros for dessert - the ice cream is probably more of an ice milk based on the texture, but it is not overly sweet and has good flavor. Plus then you don't have to feel so guilty about eating it. The only thing we haven't been super impressed with is the brisket on Sunday (but the creamed corn was excellent). It was good, but I prefer Texas-style brisket and this was not that."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here. I liked our server she was nice and knowledgable! I ordered the steak and mash potatoes and a glass of wine. I started with the corn soup. Good flavor.  My steak was cooked perfectly. The mash potatoes something was off about them not sure if it was too much cheese? I enjoyed the sauce drizzled on top. Menu was different to what I'm use to. Looking forward to trying new things. Overall I like this place I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Best, most quality farm to table restaurant in Madison. You will definitely get your money worth. I love all brunch, lunch and dinner dishes. Brunch and lunch are slightly cheaper than dinner. But the portion is still huge regardless. The cocktails are pretty diverse and tasty. Everything is fresh and quality. I definitely love the special events they had on a Sunday night every month. It is not well advertise so make sure you check their website because you don't want to miss out on that. I went on a Spanish wine and dine special event and it costed $65 in total. I couldn't be more satisfied. They chef just traveled to Spain and he went back and created Spanish themed dishes that were absolutely amazing. He explained the dishes and the wine that went with it. It was a great learning experience for me. As a foodie, nothing is better than learning about what you eat and drink while enjoying it"}
{"text":"Nice meal and fine drinks. The service was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, perfect for brunch. The food was fantastic, and they have lots of special cocktails. Get a mule! They have house-made ginger beer on tap."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! Drinks were poorly made and insanely small. Food was over priced and only mediocre. I'm more than willing to pay a high price for good food and drinks but these didn't measure up. I feel like this restaurant had an identity crisis going on."}
{"text":"Brunch at Oliver's is much better than their dinner offerings. I dig the atmosphere here and recommend it for gatherings with friends-- you'll actually be able to hear one another. The drinks are pretty good (they obviously care a lot about the bar situation), so don't pass up a chance to partake."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Very nice clean, trendy.  However extremely LOUD, they really need some sound absorption inside.  Service: This was the best part.  Our waitress was very attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly.  Food:  On the average side for the price point.  I had the butternut squash soup (ok), pork chop (good pork, but could have used some more flavor), brussel sprouts (very good) and sweet potato (excellent flavor, but a lot of butter).     Drinks:  Friend had the Old Fashioned, which I am not sure why they don't make a Wisconsin style Old Fashion?  Sad to say the glass was very small, full of ice and not even filled to the top with the drink, for $8 was very disappointed.    Won't be going back, but I wish them the best of luck in a very tough market!"}
{"text":"This place was just good enough. Great people. Great service. I had the fried bluegill. It was salty but good. It came on a bun the wouldn't fit in my mouth. Fish was cooked right. Not anything too special. Roast beef was too salty and over cooked. We went here only because we were moving and took a break. Too many food options in Madison to be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love Happy Hour at Oliver's - great deals and apps. Good and drinks are great. Lunch/brunch services food has been a little slow from the kitchen, but service is great."}
{"text":"Oliver's is the place I take someone for a nice upscale meal when I don't feel like driving downtown. They have a nice rotating menu based on seasonal ingredients, and I really appreciate that they take care to let the ingredients express themselves rather than conform to cuisine orthodoxy. When I come here, I somehow end up gravitating to their fish entrees, and despite Madison's distance to the ocean, their seafood is pretty fresh. The veggies work with the meat, and the sauce adds a layer of flavor without overpowering the expression of the other parts of the dish. The things just work well, without trying too hard.  While their wines by the glass never impressed me, their drinks are fantastic. The bartender there is passionate about what he's doing, and it shows in the care he puts in each drink. For example, the tonic used in their gin and tonic is made in-house, infused with aromatics and herbs like ginger, anise, and thyme. A gin and tonic with that tonic creates such a much more complex and interesting drink experience. And that's just the start - every drink is made with care and forethought. The bar holds its own as much as the kitchen, and it might be worth coming here just for drinks.  In short, Oliver's, alongside Lombardino's, is a great food opportunity located on the West side. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Am I eating in someone's Pottery Barn condo?   Food was predictable. Prices are presumptuous. The space is semi soul-crushing. I mean, it's just really boring for a \"public house\".   They do have ginger beer on tap for drinks which is cool but the booze pours are more Utah and less Wisconsin. Cheese plate is decent, speaking of obligatory Wisco Yelp comments.   If you moved the entire place to Willy St for a year, made it smoke every day and then put it on a truck back to Its current location it may be closer to a public house than a hotel lobby bar. At that point everything tastes and feels better.   Probably too harsh, but I'm growing tired of these contrived, street-level condo restaurants with little soul."}
{"text":"My third time at Oliver's, but my first time for restaurant week. I'm glad we made reservations because it was packed! Given the busy atmosphere, it wasn't a surprise that our food and service was a little slow. This just gave us time to catch up with our friends. We were lucky to find a parking spot in the lot next door, as our friends had to park several blocks away. It's located in a great neighborhood off of old university, just a bit inconvenient for winter. We each ended up having three courses as part of their restaurant week special. The food was absolutely delicious and definitely somewhere I would return... although, they are a little in the pricey side. I appreciated that vegetarian menu items were offered... and they are willing to customize your food to meet any dietary restrictions. Drinks were delicious as well!"}
{"text":"All right, brunch lovers, listen up! I have good news to share. I met a friend for brunch yesterday and she recommended we go to Oliver's. It was my first time there and from the minute I stepped in the door, I knew she had led me in a classy yet relaxed & very tasty direction.  Our server, who's name happened to be Oliver (I know! What are the chances...), was attentive and lovely and patient and helpful in a very balanced & nuanced way. We really appreciated him. Our coffee cups never went cold and he had great ideas on what to order. I also want to make note that they make all their own meats, in house, people! Pretty great!!! And boy howdy, is it wildly apparent.  Their corned beef and hash, wow! The meat just fell apart and my friend was practically silent as she happily ate her meal. I'll be getting that next time. I ordered Willi's Omelet which has sweet, caramelized shallots, thick-cut, house-made bacon, spinach, tiny bits of apple and cheddar inside with a luscious, but light chive hollandaise drizzled over the top. The omelet was insane. INSANE! One of the best I've ever had. And I've had a lot of omelets. Just sayin'.  Along with that I got the rosti potatoes and some lightly dressed greens. The potatoes were just okay for me. They are finely shredded potatoes, not very flavorful, that were dark on the outside and stacked a bit too thick so they weren't as evenly finished inside as I would have liked. But they were all right and I had added cheddar to them so that helped. Next time I'll get the roasted potatoes instead. Now that I think of it, Oliver recommended the roasted, but I was apparently too curious about the rosti. Next time. And there will be a next time. Oh yes!"}
{"text":"It all depends what you are coming here for:  Local beer - good  Dinner - colorful Beet Salad with lemon vinaigrette was tasty though I personally didn't care for the bitter mixed greens   House flatbread with ham, pistachio pesto, etc was tasty  Ribeye and sliced potatoes were perfection  Good conversation - impossible! And not because of the music - there was none. It was just so loud, people were shouting across their own tables to be heard! For that alone I subtracted a star. When I'm seated at a corner table for two and it's impossible to carry-on a conversation because of the level of noise, it's highly unlikely I'll ever return, regardless of how good the food may be. Especially when our food and 2 beers total was $65 before the tip!"}
{"text":"I have been itching to try out Oliver's since it opened, and finally found the time to do so. I went for brunch, and had no problem finding a table for two at 1pm (late brunch!). The menu offers a surprising amount of vegetarian-friendly meals, and even though I'm not vegetarian, I went for the Veggie Benny. Replacing the meat with portabellas was an excellent choice!  The only item I did not care for was the roasted potatoes. Seems like something easy to do right, but somehow they were completely oversalted. I had to douse them in hot sauce to make them palatable.   Roasted potatoes aside, I was nicely surprised at the affordability and atmosphere of Oliver's Public House. It's definitely a place to plan your next brunch, and make sure to try their bloody mary, too!"}
{"text":"A decent choice for brunch, especially in the near West side of town.  There is a big emphasis on farm to table sourcing, and there are a few standouts. The Big Island Breakfast brunch entree offers house made lamb sausage patties, eggs, mushrooms, grains, and salad greens.   Housemade sausage is always a plus for me, and the lamb patties have an earthy flavor without being overly gamey. I think dinner is where things fall apart a little bit--the service and food is good, but the price point can seem a little high.  On the other hand, one must consider that many of their dinner entrees are centered around locally sourced meats, which costs more than conventional meats,no doubt about it. I've always been satisfied with the service and Oliver's offers a strong beverage program (including a non-alcoholic beverage menu), a rarity in this neighborhood.  Overall, this is a good choice in the neighborhood and I would recommend brunch and drinks as the strong points."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We had gone for brunch on our hotel's recommendation, expecting a pretty standard buffet...instead we had wonderful tableside service, and some unusual, but fantastic, food!  The corned beef breakfast was really fun and filling, and the multiple people in my party who ordered the beer waffles were very happy with their choice.  Very highly recommend."}
{"text":"I braved the cold and decided to return to the restaurant to see if the kinks that were ever so present during my first visit have since been worked out.  My reaction is mixed. I am definitely a fan and will be back for a drink (or three) at the bar.  The bar staff is super attentive and the drinks on their menu all hit the spot.  I am also digging their tap beer selection as they feature some unique and different ones. I am not, however, sold on their food.  At the price points, I expect better executed dishes. As it was cold and blustery, I opted for the Glazed Pork Shoulder that sat on top  of a white bean puree, accompanied with roasted apple and bacon lardons.  I can respect the farm to table element but for $21, I found the pork shoulder to be a little tough and dry (neither of which I would expect from a Berkshire hog). I still feel, over time, when the bright shiny feel of a new restaurant wears off in the community, Oliver's will have difficulty pulling in the customer's.  Let's face it, there are many places in Madison that espouse farm to table at similar price points which execute and deliver more solidly than Oliver's.  I will be back for drinks but methinks not for anything food related."}
{"text":"We went to Oliver's Public House for brunch.  I ordered the Willi's omelet ($10) and it was amazing!  Great coffee as well.  Although, the server poured me a cup and then asked me to try it to see if it was cold because it was the end of the pot.  My boyfriend ordered the corn beef and hash ($13) and it was pretty good too.  A bit small in portion.  The service was pretty bad this day though.  The girl barely talked to us.  We have been here for drinks on a different day and were very impressed."}
{"text":"Brunch? Sure! Best bloody in town. Smoked tomatoes in the base.  Omelet? You want the Willy's. Why? House-smoked bacon lardons, spinach and diced roasted apple folded into the middle with the cheese.  Only on weekends and select holidays, like the 4th of July!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at Oliver's. While the person that seated us wasn't very knowledgeable about the wine list they gave us a taste of the two wines we were interested in (both were quite good). They have an extensive selection of cheeses on their cheese board to choose from. My only disappointment was the Hook's Bleu which I have had before but this batch just wasn't as good as I remembered. They also brought out some gluten free bread for me without me asking when they realized that I had a gluten intolerance which was a nice touch.  My pan roasted trout was delicious and my companion really enjoyed her mac and cheese. The chocolate mousse for dessert was pretty scrumptious too. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Not ever, have I written a poor review. That said...here it goes. I love supporting local businesses. However, in this instance...will not be returning to Oliver's. Here's the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. First the good....our waitress was great. Super apologetic, prompt, pleasant. The bad....my husband, a beer connoisseur...was slightly put off by the option to only order a 12 oz IPA (Founder's) and was steered towards a porter named \"shake\". It was listed as an \"American porter\"....failing to mention it tasted like a milkshake. We'll, let's just say, my husband who has NEVER sent a beer back...did so. It was absolutely not his taste. Any normal bartender would usually exchange the beer...give a taste of something different...nope, not at Oliver's. He was informed that the beer would not be \"comped\" and he was welcome to order something different...but would need to pay. Not the same at vibe at other places found on Monroe St. Now for the ugly....check out pic. Beautiful view from the seating in the corner. Sorry for cheating on you Monroe St. Never again"}
{"text":"Excellent drinks! Really appreciate their many house made bitters, sodas, syrups & such. (However, my husband did order a beer that was $8 and maybe 8oz. Tiny a@& beer. I also got a martini only 3/4 full. More on this later)  Super friendly staff! Well knowledged and happy to make your visit as pleasurable as possible.  Great atmosphere! Warm and inviting.   Food? The reason we're all here: Nothing to write home about AND stupid expensive, especially for the miniscule portions. For example, we ordered a cheese plate during happy hour. $4! Banging!...  they tell us its $4 a cheese. Oh. OK! We picked three. When it arrived, smallest portion of cheese I've ever seen! I honestly get more cheese when I ask cheese mongers at the grocery for a sample. This is Wisconsin! C'mon, don't stiff me my dairy goods. My husband I each split the 3 baby bites of cheese. We decide to supplement by ordering duck confit. Came with 2 peices of small toast, 1/4c bland bland white beans. My husband's half had MAYBE 1oz of duck. My peice had none. Zero meat. Bean bread. $12. As my husband said, it's some egregious S#%@.  The meal continued like this. $80 with tip in and we left hungry and underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I've seen mostly positive reviews for Oliver's - but mixed nonetheless. We ordered a couple of the specialty drinks - the Wiskey Smash and the House on the Rock. They were both really good and worth returning for.   We opted for a couple of appetizers - mostly because the rest of the menu felt a bit uninspiring given the price points.   The Frites were fine if perhaps under seasoned. They came with catsup and a pepper aioli. The aioli seemed over worked - it had more of a butter texture. It did have decent flavor - but lacked the expected mouth feel of an aioli.   We also ordered the Shrimp, Scallops, and Grits. This dish was worth recommending and ordering again. The shrimp were probably unnecessary - they were smallish and underwhelming compared to the perfectly cooked scallops and medley of roasted/sautéed veggies.   We took a look at the dessert menu and given a redo, I'd order something else. We ordered the bread pudding. It was more of two small pieces of French Toast. Decent flavor, but didn't pass muster for a Bread Pudding. It was served with a handful of walnuts and some sort of sorbet. The walnuts could have used some sort of culinary treatment. The sorbet had a descent flavor - perhaps ginger - but textually didn't work well with the mislabeled  bread pudding. I would have expected something with a creamy mouth feel.   Oliver's is still pretty new - it's listed as \"hot and new\" - but it seems a bit sterile and as others have noted it's noisy. The drinks take Oliver's from a two star to a three star place. It's nice to see another restaurant in this area of town. I think Oliver's still needs to find it groove if it wants to be a long term resident in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The restaurant was loud and cold. We asked to be moved outside to feel warmer. The waitress was wonderful but food was meh.  Not worth the cost. The only good meal out of the four of us was the pork chop."}
{"text":"Executive Summary: Parking can be tricky.  There is a small shared lot nearby and street parking if you're lucky.  Limited options for gluten sensitive...especially if you're also vegetarian.  Our server was SO accommodating.  I was struggling to find gluten free options on their menu because nothing is labeled and there were so many fancy ingredients I had to keep looking them up on my phone to know if they either A) contained gluten, or B) contained meat. Yeah, I'm not a fancy gal!  Anyway, when I told the server my struggles he made a special trip back to the kitchen to ask the chef what gluten free, vegetarian options were available.  I ended up going with the beet salad.  It was delicious, but small...and expensive at $8.  And I get a bit cranky when I have to have salad for dinner.  I might give this place another try but the menu is going to be pretty limiting for me.  Sigh."}
{"text":"Here's the deal: Parking is difficult, the service was slow, my omelette was weirdly wet and I will probably never be back.  I walked past Oliver's Public House on my way to 5th Element a few months ago and thought that it looked intriguing. I waited until I found myself on that side of town again and decided to work OPH into my day. I had high hopes, and maybe that was the first mistake.  My friend and I went around noon and both ordered breakfast-oriented items. The hostess said that our server would be right with us but after waiting for over 20 minutes she came back up to us and took our order.  After deciding to go the breakfast route, I got the Willi Omelet with a side of hashbrowns. My omelette came sitting in what I can only describe as a small pool of warm water. I've ordered many omelettes in my day, but this one was wet, like, oddly so. Slimy might be the correct word. Anyway, the hashbrowns were a perfect circle and tasted as if they were pulled directly from the freezer, warmed up and slid onto my plate.   Checking to see if it wasn't just me, I asked my friend how her meal was. She said that the fries tasted like air and her breakfast sandwich was giving her a stomach ache. We paid kind of a lot for a sub-par experience and were ultimately disappointed. I hope this was just an off day for the restaurant, especially since the reviews I am seeing seem to contradict my own experience and the website images do not reflect what I found on my plate.   I won't be back, but I gave it a try."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been to Olivers once, long ago, near the time it opened, back when Soren was a bartender (though not there the night we visited) and we were supremely underwhelmed, I mean, the food was good, just not worthy of a go-back.  But yesterday we were thinking about Brunch, and didn't want to drive very far, so Olivers got chance #2.  They mostly delivered.  It helps that the day was beautiful, and we got to eat outside. We both had omelets, and my trout one, with salmon actually because they were out of trout, was tasty and light, and the accompanying toast was the perfect amount, and I liked the greens/radish salad.  The potatoes that went with my wife's omelet (also well-cooked and seasoned) were excellent.  Crispy slices of delightfulness.  But the best best best item was hands down the Cinnamon Roll.  Dear Lord what a treat.  Order this item and savor it.  Delicious.  The waitstaff training bugged me.  \"How are you enjoying your first bites\"  \"Are you still enjoying this\"  These are phrases that are completely unnatural and sound so stilted coming from a waiter.  I know it's \"the thing\" in restaurants now, because that's how I'm asked all the time -- unless it's a conspiracy to annoy me -- but what is wrong with \"Is everything all right\" and \"Are you finished with that?\"  Leave my enjoyment out of it!  (At least the waiter didn't say \"Good Choice\" when I ordered)."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the service was pretty poor. Despite it being pretty empty, it took a good ten minutes to get our glasses of wine, and that's after asking our waitress if she had forgotten about seven minutes after ordering. We had skate, which was decent, but a bit over cooked. I'd give it another try if I was in the neighborhood, but it's not a place I'll seek out."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant! Love, love, love the wood floors.  My partner and I shared the ricotta fritters, they were fluffy and not too greasy. Would definitely order again. For dinner, I had the tagliatelle, which is quite possibly my new favorite entree in Madison. The smoked mushrooms are amazing! The server warned me that people either love or hate the tagliatelle. It is a dish for people who like flavor! My partner had the cornish hen and enjoyed it very much. For desert, we shared a ice cream trio. The cinnamon-pear was my favorite but the beet ice cream with chocolate covered walnuts was impressive. I love beets but was a little hesitant to try them in my ice cream. My reservations were ill-founded, everyone who loves beets must try the beet ice cream at Oliver's! I also had the mulled cider with desert and would highly recommend this delicious drink, especially on a cold night.  As for the service, we were seated promptly and our server was attentive.   Some reviewers complained about the prices and menu selection. This is a nice farm-to-table restaurant. It is not a burger joint. If you want a cheap burger, walk across the street to The Blue Moon. If you want a high end burger, head down University a half mile to La Brioche. Oliver's is a great addition to the near west side, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Been to Oliver's twice for brunch and once for cocktails and all three visits have been spot on. Everything at Oliver's is made in-house using fresh and local ingredients, which is apparent because everything we've eaten or drank has been delicious. The service is excellent and servers/bartenders can be counted on to make great recommendations. On top of all this awesomeness the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I've only been to Oliver's for brunch, but every-time I've been there I've had a great experience. My favorite dish has been the grilled grass-fed steak and eggs. They have very tasty bloodys which I definitely recommend! I like their atmosphere and their patio area during the summer. The service has been great every time I've been there, and overall I definitely enjoy this restaurant. I will definitely have to come for dinner some time!"}
{"text":"First time here for Sunday brunch. I like the menu and atmosphere. Our waitress, Claire (or maybe Clara) was fantastic. My Willi's Omelet was delicious and perfectly portioned. Rich and balanced with the sweetness of apples and caramelized shallots. I appreciated the prefect side of lightly dressed greens. My husband got the Pastrami, which he loved. It was so pretty, and all the strong flavors balanced well. Mustard sauce wasn't overwhelming, bacon kraut was tasty, and the hearty rye toast stood up to soaking up all the deliciousness from sauces and perfectly runny over easy eggs.  Drinks at a little too expensive, but I felt the food prices were more than fair for great quality local ingredients."}
{"text":"I visited Olivers on a Friday evening, with a reservation for 3 people at 5:15. It was restaurant week and I realized people would be coming in after us. However, at 6:40, after we'd finished our meals and dessert, paid, and we were just finishing a glass of wine, the hostess came to our table and told us we had to leave by 7:00 for the next seating. That was unacceptable and incredibly rude. We had 20 minutes to enjoy our wine and finish but apparently that wasn't ok with the people a Oliver's. I used to stop in for drinks and apps all the time but I will not be doing so anymore. I feel sorry for our server but management should really do a better job of planning and treating guests with respect."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with a group of six. I had reviewed the menu in advance online and was actually worried I was going to have to order plain eggs and toast off the children's menu, since the online menu was very limited and not at all to my tastes. Fortunately the menu in the restaurant was larger (although still not huge) and I was pleasantly surprised to see a dish with eggs and fried green tomatoes. Since I can never turn down the chance to fried green tomatoes, I ordered that. The fried green tomatoes were very small and thin and had holes in the center like donuts. They bore little resemblance to the delicious FGTs I've had in the South. I can cut them a break on the fried green tomatoes, since this is such an unusual dish, but I was also disappointed with my eggs. I asked for my eggs to be scrambled, and I was instead served scrambled eggs in omelette form, i.e., a completely plain (no cheese even) omelette. It was also overcooked.  If I were reviewing solely based on my dish, I would probably give two stars, but others in my party were happy with their dishes. In particular, everyone who ordered toast seemed really pleased with the bread, and the poached and fried eggs looked much better than my 'scrambled' eggs.  Note that they have outdoor seating but they do not allow dogs."}
{"text":"The food tasted very fresh. The cocktail selection was amazing. The outdoor seating had a nice ambience. Overall, I had an excellent first visit, and will certainly be back! The burger was one of the best I've had in Madison. Also got a reasonably priced cheese plate--all their cheeses were local to Wisconsin/Minnesota. I loved everything about this place."}
{"text":"Had a great time! Drinks were awesome, food was awesome and Our server Roger was awesome. Love all the local flavors. We showed up with a larger group and everyone had a great time!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty terrific. There's a lovely bar--the bartender was a sweetie. I love the window seating. The restaurant was spotless.   Focaccia served with honey and sea salt butter is food crack...so addictive. I ordered the chicken sandwich, not expecting much and just hoping for something kinda healthy. It had Penterman's \"Marieke\" Gouda, rhubarb, greens and a house bun. It was delicious! It was served with a salad which was fresh. Dessert was a chocolate beet cake with chevre ice cream, fig balsamic jam and candied tarragon. It was okay.   Staff were great. The server was very personable and professional.   I recommend this place. I really enjoyed the experience."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Large selection of beer and wine. The place is contemporary and pleasant."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend and reservations for 5:30 could not have been better timing. Things started hustlin' & bustlin' around six. Cute place with nice ambience. Service was... Here it comes........ EXCELLENT. I'd say top notch so far in Madison J have experienced. Now, someone knows how to run a business. I shall get to the food, but I need to emphasize and acknowledge the service )I'll get to that too.  Start off with delicious bread with house made butter cream. That was just the start. I ordered the Seared Scallop & Shrimp with the grits, bacon, potatoes, mushroom. It was delicious. Now, worth to know is- this item is on the Starter list, can up the ante to an Entree for extra $5. Shrimp was smaller than what I was expecting, but nonetheless, delicious. Worth every savory orgasmic bite!!! My friend ordered the House Salad. Fresh, great vinaigrette. Must try. She ordered the Fresg Taglietelle. Pasta was perfectly cooked Al Dente. Sauce was sweet and smoky, but too sweet from the corn for my friend's taste. It was however, perfectly sweet for me. The server notices her still full plate and asks if the choice didn't work. Friend tells her it was too sweet for her taste and server delightfully tells her that she can order another item and take the Taglietelle off the check. She said, \"we want our customers to enjoy the food when they visit, so I'd be more than happy to get you something else you'd enjoy.\" And BOO-YAH! Friend orders the dearly beloved House Salad. And she still packs the Taglietelle for ME, because I actually liked the sweetness of the dish. And Happily Ever After.  Will try the Roasted Beet Salad next time with the Ricotta Fritters. They also have the most interesting non-alcohol drinks that I think many will enjoy. Probably the longest review in my Yelp history, but want to commend them for great excellent service. Especially in Madison. And to top it off,great fresh food and drinks! Try it! Please do yourself a favor and do it!!!!!! Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Amazing. In town for work, we popped in because it was in walking distance and had beer. We were blown out of the water, though, by the terrific service and phenomenal menu (not to mention killer atmosphere.)  The cheeseboard is a fun starter with great options. The mac and cheese has brussels sprouts in it and is divine, and the buckwheat squash crepes were delicious.   Beer menu is solid but could use a few more local/ craft selections.  Overall, though- wish we had a place like this in DC!"}
{"text":"I wish there was a zero star button. If you don't have a reservation, the staff does not acknowledge you are there. Even if the place is clearly empty, you get a table in the corner and have to crowd three people around a two person circular table. The food was OK BUT SEVERELY OVER PRICED FOR THE AMOUNT OF FOOD GIVEN."}
{"text":"Very, very good brunch!  I've eaten here three times for brunch and each time ordered something different.  What a delightful addition to the near west side!  The omelettes were the highlight of each meal."}
{"text":"Hubby and I went here last night for dinner and drinks and we give it 4 stars.   Food- I ordered the Beet salad and butternut squash soup, and hubby had garden salad and Mac N Cheese entree.  Everything was to our liking!  The drink menu was probably our favorite part- lots of options and custom cocktails.  There was even a page for Non Alcoholic and specialty sodas, which was an addition we were impressed by.  The service was exceptional and we left happy."}
{"text":"Some friends and I went in after work for a cocktail (or 2). Who's counting? I started with a standard mule. Very cold and refreshing after a long day at the office. They have a large, comfortable bar to cozy up to. All four of us are voyeurs and wanted to watch the bartender at work. She approached eat of our drinks with care and consideration. I liked to see that. One of my friends wanted a bartender's choice. She asked for the liquor preference (a asked a couple of other taste preference questions) and went to work on his cocktail. He was very delighted with what she mixed up for him. We tried the smokey popcorn and the toasted nuts. Both of these apps are small portions (maybe these 2 items would have been best to share between 2 people only). If we were more hungry, we would have gotten a couple more apps to share. I've got to go back for some more cocktails (and our dinner). I saw some of the food coming out to others at the bar and the plates looked pretty good. They do have a good selection of wines and beer too. Parking is a bit tricky though. You may need to plan ahead to get a spot nearby. The location doesn't provide a lot of parking options. They do have bike parking nearby."}
{"text":"With its commitment to using high quality local ingredients and its hip setting on Old University Avenue, Oliver's is brimming with potential.  While I did not dislike any of the components from my recent dining experience, I just didn't feel the quality of my meal justified the high price tag.   Oliver's oozes casual elegance, from the gleaming zinc bar that catches your eye the moment you walk into the restaurant to the slow lighting and black and white pictures of rural Wisconsin.  It is a casual enough setting to stop by after work for a cocktail, but dressed up enough to be a date night destination.  I also give high marks to the service staff.  A host warmly greeted my guest and me and promptly seated us. Our splendid server kept a close eye on our table throughout the meal, clearing dishes, checking beverage levels and the like.  Oliver's executive chef Patrick McCormick honed his craft under the tutelage of Heritage Tavern's Dan Fox and Nostrano's Tim Dahl.   Under his direction, the restaurant employs a farm to table philosophy, utilizing products from Keewaydin Organic Farms in Viroqua, beef from Iowa's Grass Run Farms and pork from Fox Valley Berkshire    As I mentioned in my intro, while the food was above average, it was not at all memorable.  My dining companion ordered the roast beef sandwich with cheddar, caramelized onions, and horseradish sauce.  The roast beef had a satisfying deep sear.  However, the sandwich came with no sides and cost $11.  Kudos to Oliver's for offering Wisco Pop's ginger brew - I am a huge fan of this invigorating beverage.  I ordered a bowl of the garlic potato soup ($8), a small house salad ($5) and an order of the house-made focaccia with honey butter (4 half slices for $3).  The soup, topped with asparagus coulis, smoked trout, crispy leeks, lacked the richness and depth of flavor that I am accustomed to in other renditions of this soup.  The fishy smoked salmon overwhelmed the other flavors of the dish and the pittance of crispy leeks meant the soup lacked much in the way of texture.  While the house salad was a feast for the eyes, I longed for textural variety and a more imaginative dressing.  The satisfying, freshly made focaccia provided the meal with some textural contrast and offered up flavor from well-made, slow fermented bread. My only beef was the $3 price tag.  With the top shelf pricing utilized by Oliver's, they should consider offering a complimentary basket of bread.  My lunch for two, with one non-alcoholic beverage, set me back $37 (with tip).  While I'm OK paying a premium for exceptional quality, I do not feel Oliver's product is worthy of the hefty price tag.   Oliver's offers its happy hour from 3 to 6 Monday - Friday, featuring $5 Old Fashioneds, $6 pours of Columbia Crest wine and $4 Mules and Bucks (with Wisco Pop Ginger Beer, suh-weet).  The happy hour food options also are intriguing (smoky butter popcorn, crispy squishy buns and poutine with brat gravy).  With the happy hour pricing of the food and drinks, this may be the best opportunity to enjoy the talents of Chef McCormick without completing depleting your wallet."}
{"text":"We went here for restaurant week, and were very impressed. The least favorite was the Brussel sprout salad app- disappointing because the first course is typically the best at these high end restaurants. It's ok because the shrimp, huge scallop & grits were AMAZING! the scallop was huge and fresh- so good!  Typically I don't get dessert because it's too heavy and overpriced, but restaurant week includes it and boy am I happy it does! The waffle was light and fluffy with toffee crumbles on top & ice cream. Perfect amount and delicious! Overall a great time."}
{"text":"My husband and I drive from Chicago to go to Oliver's...it's that good! We've been twice and had a reservation each time. We were always seated immediately. Granted our reservations were both around 5:30pm; not exactly peak dinner time. Waiter and waitress were attentive both times, were helpful with answering questions about food and drinks, checked back multiple times to make sure everything was good, and made sure our water, drinks, and bread was also full. Speaking of bread, their butter that comes with the bread is so good. The food is wonderful and pairs together items and sauces I wouldn't think of combining. The drinks are strong and flavorful. The prices seem reasonable to us when compared with Chicago. However, if you are not from a city, the prices may seem on the higher side. Our first time there, the owner even came out and chatted with us after we told our waiter that we had found the restaurant on google and were loving the experience. Parking can be a little tricky."}
{"text":"Woah!  What a difference! I've been here 5 or 6 times -including opening night. I had a fish fry (perch) for $18. I thought the price was really high but I've been checking out fish fries all over town so i thought \"what the heck. \"  Big mistake.    Service was good. Atmosphere was a little wierd as there were very few people.  Portions were very generous (4 pieces of fish) battered tempura style.  Unfortunately, the batter was fried in oil too cool. The crust was soggy, the fish tasted flat at best.  I couldn't finish two pieces.  It was horrible. Coleslaw was inedible. No flavor, nothing there.  Tasted like cardboard. The potatoes were very good but couldn't salvage the disaster that was delivered.  If this place doesn't turn around, they will be gone in a few months.  Worst meal I've had in Madison this year by far.  Wish it wasn't so as i live a few blocks away. They will have yo work hard to get me to return.   Yech!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try this newer resturant.  The menu seemed a bit limited for a Brunch menu.   We placed our order for biscuits and gravy and an omelet.  My husband ordered a side of hash browns for $4.  When we recieved our meals the hash browns were about 3-4 inch tiny disk round of dry crispy and lightly salted potato. $4 for this tiny garnish.  The petite  salad was like a garnish too and my omelet which was very small, had little of any of the ingredients in it with barely a tablespoon of hollandiase which was described.  Not much flavor with all 3 tiny items on my plate.  My husband wanted to know where the brat was in his gravy over his biscuits.  This was way over priced for not so great food.  We will not venture back when there is so many wonderful places that offer you a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"They have cocktails on tap. What else do you need to know?"}
{"text":"The menu looks fantastic on paper and theyve done a very nice job with the physical space. This is where it ended for us on this visit. Our server was unable to answer very simple questions about the wine list - taking the menu off the table to say \"we have two Chardonnay choices. One oaked and one that isn't\" (we saw this ourselves by reading the menu which is why we asked for her suggestion).  French onion soup was cold and overly salty. Beet salad was sadly devoid of beets. Scallops and shrimp was beige - a dish full of beige with chewy shrimp. The burger was good, the frites were so salty they burned our tongues (and I am a person who is liberal with salt so this is saying a lot).   The most disconcerting thing about the whole night was the cleaning spray and rags that were left sitting out two tables over. Who wants to eat a nice meal while staring at cleaning supplies? Not me.   Undecided if a second visit will happen."}
{"text":"Had held off on trying this for a while since none of the preparations looked particularly interesting, especially in light of the prices charged.  I guess having hipster servers in an upscale-ish setting that is trying hard to seem like it isn't trying hard is enough to justify $20-30 entrees these days.  Tried for lunch a few weeks ago and was disappointed.  Had a salad was no better than something from panera, except it that was mostly greens, overdressed, and had minimal chicken, nuts, and olives.  Not terrible or anything, just a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Recommended especially for cocktails and weekend brunch.   I'm a regular at this place, and they have consistently good service and meals. The brunch and the cocktails are clutch. The dinners are great, too, with excellent locally-sourced dishes."}
{"text":"Amazing food! It's very limiting to vegetarians. Fortunately, I found the mushroom pasta delicious! It was extremely savory, and the flavors blended perfectly. The salad and appetizer selection was impeccable.   The service was amazing too. My parents and I felt very well taken care of while dining here."}
{"text":"We love this neighborhood spot. Their fun cocktails including homemade tonic are a great way to start the experience. The service is responsive and fun. The food is tasty and represents local choices (especially the cheese). It is such a treat having Oliver's in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Got slight food poison from the trout omelet. Thought about reporting them, but got better the next day. Would never go again."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago for brunch. We got seated right away at noon on a Sunday, which kinda surprises me - I'm guessing because the location is a bit out of downtown. I had the corned beef and my boyfriend had the steak and eggs. The corned beef was amazing!! it was served in some type of hot plate on top of mashed potatoes and 2 eggs. It's probably one of the best mashed potatoes I've had ever.  The steak and eggs was cooked perfectly and everything tasted really good. The only thing we wished for is bigger portion. I usually couldn't finish my brunch plate, but I cleaned this one up. I would suggest getting a side order with your meal. I also had the Bloody Mary - it's decent.  Service was good and they had outdoor seating."}
{"text":"GET THE BLOODY HERE!!! They make the best in town, as a bloody blogger lbespie.weebly.com , I feel like I can attest to this. They smoke their tomatoes and then blend them into a house made mix, and that makes all the difference in the world for me. It's still a light enough juice that it's not thick and heavy. (Sorry, I don't have I pic b/c I slammed the drink.) The brunch was seriously great...I ordered the Big Island Breakfast, and was blown away with flavor. Get it. Just get it. It's like a breakfasty gourmet mix of ingredients where dinner meets breakfast ingredients. Think rich brown gravy, sausage, lamb, eggs, barley...take a bite of this unique, well made dish then have a sip of your cocktail, look at your partner and sigh while looking into each others eyes as you lean in for an embrace. It's that good."}
{"text":"I came in for brunch on a Sunday morning. It was already full of customers. The cocktails looked so beautiful and amazing. I tried the steak and eggs. The medium-rare steak was cooked perfectly-the right color and texture. It was so tender and juicy and flavorful. It went well with the mushrooms and caramelized onions. I also tried the most recommended Willi's omelet. I'm not a huge fan of omelets, but this one was really good. It was packed with different ingredients. Every single ingredient adds a unique flavor to the omelet. The salad was light and fresh. The hash browns were crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside. It was seasoned very specially."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night.  Food was fine.  We had the salmon, tuna and lamb.  Lamb was the best .  Service was excellent.  Both the bartender and our waitress, Bella, were very attentive.  We would go back."}
{"text":"Slow slow and slow, and the place wasn't more than half full, Sunday at noon. Brunch fare was fine but nothing special, once it came."}
{"text":"We came for restaurant week, so I cannot speak to their regular menu. Overall, it was a great meal. I had the bruschetta for an app, pork shoulder for my entree and stout waffle for dessert.   The app had a whitefish spread on it. It tasted good but there wasn't much of it. I was a little underwhelmed with this appetizer. The pork shoulder was great. Decent sized portion and was very tender. The potatoes and pineapple side were a great addition and complimented the pork nicely. The stout waffle was delicious. Waffle was cooked perfectly and add in a scoop of ice cream and pecan crumble and you have yourself a great dessert."}
{"text":"Came here for a weekday lunch and we were very disappointed. Only one server in the entire restaurant. Server did check on us when we sat down, but took fifteen minutes for her to come back. Food took a very long time to arrive and our dishes didn't all come at the same time. The food was satisfactory but overpriced.   Pros: great ambience and decor Cons: long wait for food, over-priced lunch items, inattentive waitstaff"}
{"text":"Oliver's Public House just gets me. The food, the drinks: everything is amazing. The best is their brunch by far.  I've been to Oliver's for a wide variety of occasions, everything from dinner to brunch to a Yelp event. The space is the ground floor of a newer apartment building, but the restaurant is set up somewhat like a horseshoe and has a small patio that opens in the summer.  As far as drinks go, they have everything imaginable: beer, wine, mixed drinks, keg cocktails, and cider. I really like the keg cocktails; I've tried the ones they rotate and never had one that I didn't like.  Their brunch food is the real shining star at this place. Being vegetarian, I normally stick to eggs, but they have portabella bacon which opens up a whole world of possibilities (because you can substitute it for most meat options). The benedicts are great because they make their own chive hollandaise and it is UH-mazing. I typically ask for benedicts without hollandaise because I don't like it, but theirs is out of this world. The burrito is also great, as are the omelettes. Listen, I've been there for quite a few brunches.  Add friendly staff that are always on top of it, and you get a 5 star restaurant. I can't wait to go back this weekend."}
{"text":"Pretty standard farm-to-table style menu (pork shoulder, steak, a pasta dish, pork plate, cheese plate, you know the drill) but all items were well-executed and enjoyable.  The one thing to note -- this place is slow.  Slo-o-o-o-o-o-o-w.  Why was it so slow?  We went for an early Wednesday night dinner and there were only three other tables full.  And yet we waited a long, long, long, long time for each course."}
{"text":"I really want to love Oliver's, because the restaurant is a great addition to our neighborhood. The brunch is awesome, but dinner is frustrating, too fussy and precious, and the serving sizes are so small! I ordered the panzanella salad and ate it in about two bites. Here it is, September, the height of the harvest, and there were hardly any tomatoes or fresh vegetables. My friend ordered the salmon and her whole meal could have been served on a bread plate. I wish they'd add some less expensive options to their dinner menu, and so, apparently, does the rest of Madison, because we were there on a Saturday night and the restaurant was almost empty. I think a few sandwiches would go a long way. It feels like a restaurant that should be medium priced. The interior is beautiful, but it isn't a white tablecloth place. Also, we were freezing under the air conditioning vents."}
{"text":"I've been cat sitting in the area, so Oliver's Public House caught my eye while driving through. I decided to come here on New Year's Eve for brunch.  Whenever I'm trying a new place for brunch, I always default to Eggs Benedict. I loved it! The hollandaise sauce was yummy. The English muffin was toasted on the grill (I think, at least that's how it tasted) and was the perfect ratio to everything else. I ordered hash browns on the side, and they were crispy just how I like it.  I also ordered the Bloody Mary, which was quite yummy. I thought it was cool that they gave a small sausage with it."}
{"text":"The first time we went here it was wonderful. Great service, great tuna steak, great ribeye. We just went there tonight and it was the complete opposite. The bartender ignored us most of the time and acted like we were a nuisance. I had tuna, which was actually moonfish, and despite the bartender telling us it was very similar to tuna, it was not. It was fishy. He also got my order wrong and forgot the mashed potatoes and when I requested them he seemed annoyed. My husband ordered the ribeye and it was chuck roast. Literally chuck roast passed off as ribeye. When we asked about it, the bartender said he'd let the cook know. $28 for chuck roast and $23 for moonfish. Never going back."}
{"text":"Lombardino's is one of my very favorite restaurants in Madison, so I have walked past Oliver's Public House many times. We have a group of friends that chooses different restaurants and this was this month's pick.  It is larger than I thought with bar chairs that are huge and heavy.  It wasn't crowded, so this worked fine.  The outdoor patio was full, but we were the only inside customers.  Fried green tomatoes appetizer- good.  Not stunning, but good.  The slaw was colorful and dressing bright. I would have preferred more fried green tomatoes (there were 3 small slices) than slaw, only because I ordered a salad. The beet salad was really tasty and nicely plated with super thin slices of apples as garnish. I love beet salads and this did not disappoint. I also love salmon, mostly made at home by my husband.  Most times out I think, why did I order the salmon?  This was possibly the best salmon at a restaurant that I have had. It was \"wild salmon with wild rice, wilted spinach, shaved carrot, roasted broccoli, spiced cucumber yogurt sauce\".  Perfectly cooked, nice spicy sauce, loved the wild rice.  I would definitely have this again.  Parking is at a premium in this area, but they apparently have parking available. I could not figure out exactly where it is.  Will study the map for next visit."}
{"text":"I wasn't very much impressed. The options were quite limited in the options that were available were fairly expensive. It was a great atmosphere and the service was wonderful.  If it would just do more to expand on their menu at a better price then it may be a place I would eat at more often."}
{"text":"I recently went to Oliver's mid-week for a birthday celebration dinner and the experience was top-notch.  The waiter was personable, polite, and extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  There were a few particular eaters in my group and the waiter was very helpful in suggesting the right menu choices for them.  The schnitzel that I ordered was lightly crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside; absolutely delicious and perfectly proportioned. My cocktail choice, the Old University, was inventive and satisfying.  Everyone in my group raved about their dinners and experience as well.  I will definitely be adding Oliver's to my regular rotation."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the best, in Madison. And I'm at least as picky about service as I am about food. It was the entire experience that deserves five stars--from the friendly greeting to the well trained wait staff to the manager's wine pairing suggestions. I took a friend here to thank her for hosting me in Madison. Our favorite? The two outstanding cheeses we tried for dessert. And I thought the price for two including wine, entrees & cheese was a crazy good value. Creative culinary team. Lovely terrace. Memorable meal. Way to go, Oliver's!"}
{"text":"Finally made it here last week! A friendly host made our seating choice easy- we were worn out after a crazy week-\"it's too hot to go back outside\" started with a cocktail and the sausage plate \"du jour\". watched our cocktails sit in bar sweating as the nervous waiter excitedly greeted his new 6 top of students...our cocktails were carried to table by hand (grab a tray) spilling and sloshing into the floor and the table! The sausage plate \"du jour\" arrived without fan fare or sauerkraut as listed on the menu ( we asked two different waiters what the sausage \"du jour\" was and never did get an answer. I'm hoping it wasn't pork as it was a bit pink for my taste! The odd non waiter who was bounding around the restaurant brought us the aforementioned sauerkraut in a coffee cup (which appears to be their \"cool\" serving dish idea as the homemade gelato came in coffee cups as well!) the ground mustard and kraut and pickled veggies were a nice start to the meal! I ordered the halibut and black pepper risotto and my companion the mushroom and cauliflower tagliatelle. Both were served in small round bowls...a larger plate with a bigger rim would have made the plate look more impressive and help justify the $28 price point! The fish was cooked and seasoned perfectly- although the risotto was more rice in a watery gray broth-the taste, delicious I just think the liquid hadn't absorbed into the risotto enough! Tagliatelle didn't disappoint either with nice chunks of roasted cauliflower and earthy mushroom flavor. Will definitely be back- the nervous waiter who introduced himself each time he appeared at the table never did come up with the sausage du jour info but the food was flavorful and the ambience warm. The $30 parking ticket I got  up the street ( I misread the sign) means I'll definitely pay attention next time- really on a dead end street at 9pm- Madison!!!!!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Madison's greatest undiscovered treasure. We've been here a few times now, but today I felt compelled to write a review because of the outstanding experience and food we had. From the host, to the bartender, even kitchen staff and our server, everyone was outstanding. Friendly, knowledgeable and just a pleasure to spend our Sunday morning with. The breakfast burrito was a culinary delight that I can't even begin to describe, which is saying something for a burrito. We've tried a couple of their omelettes as well and they are all incredible. They have the best bloody mary in Madison and a list of other breakfast cocktails that really make the trip here worthwhile. We've been here for dinner as well and had a similar experience, but the brunch really just knocks it out of the park. While the food and drinks are great, my favorite part is how after just a few trips here, we were made to feel like part of the family. Greeted by name and treated like old friends, this is definitely our new go-to for any occasion and I can't encourage others enough to give this place a shot."}
{"text":"What a cozy spot on Old University Avenue.  We went on a Friday night without reservations so it was packed but we managed to snag a bar table without too much waiting.  Atmosphere is great, bustling yet welcoming at the same time.  The drinks were phenomenal!  While this is a tall order, their Public House Old Fashioned is arguably the best old fashioned I've ever had (beats Dorf Haus and Avenue Bar)!  The Whiskey Smash was also outstanding and beautifully served (which I also loved).    Food was great as well.  I had the scallop and shrimp appetizer as my entrée and it was outstanding and a great deal compared to the main entrees.  My scallops were cooked to perfection and the grits were also to die for...not too salty and not too mushy.  My husband had the steamed mussels and clams (not my cup of tea) and also said they were fantastic.  Overall, great food, a fun atmosphere and KILLER drinks.  We would go back just for cocktails if we couldn't get in for dinner...what a great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"LOUD! OVERPRICED! Impossible to find parking near-by. The $28 monkfish dish was very small and overcooked. Very good service though.  Won't be back because there are too many wonderful restaurants in Madison that serve similar food that are much, much better (Pig in a Fur Coat, Forequarter, Harvest, Merchant and so on.)"}
