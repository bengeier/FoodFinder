{"text":"I live in sq hill. I pass every pizza place here everytime I drive out to the pizza shack. I wont eat any other pizza in the burgh. Uniquely awesome. Thick soft crust, sweet sauce,  sharp cheeze, awesome owner. If your from the New Castle/Youngstown area, this will be your pizza spot. Just like grandma used to make."}
{"text":"Great pizza .. The sweet sauce, blended fresh cheese and thick crust makes the pizza so good and unique."}
{"text":"Pizza Shack is a Pittsburgh institution. It's not in the heart of the city, but off 51 in the South Hills. It's easy to pass by without a second glance, especially because it is closed most of the time.

Call ahead for a pizza, and it's guaranteed that (if they're open) they're very busy at any time of night. I recommend ordering a plain pizza, but all of the toppings I have tried are pretty good too. Plain just hits the perfect balance of flavour, in my opinion. When you come to pick it up, sometimes you can grab a chat with the owners, who are friendly and quirky to talk to.

The pizza comes as a square. Some of the pieces have crust, others do not. The crust it crispy and almost like a dense pastry, but the sauce is sweet like stewed tomatoes and jam... or something like that. Just try it. It's so worth it."}
{"text":"Had high hopes based on the reviews as we were in mood for homestyle pizza, not from a chain.   We ordered the two med pizza special (6 toppings in total, 4 pops and 2 dips).  The toppings were plentiful, loved that they used real bacon strips, sauce was tasty.  The biggest disappointment was the crust - it was hard, almost tasted stale and pretty much inedible even with the dipping sauce. 

The search continues for great pizza in Pickering!"}
{"text":"Possibly the worst pizza I've ever had, and I've had a lot of bad pizza. Heck, I've made bad pizza that was better than this. The sauce is more like a tomato jam (barely even tomato), the cheese is rubbery, the crust is like a pie crust along the edges and on the bottom it's more like a weird chewy \"wonder bread.\"

Just, ugh. So bad. Every once in a while my darling husband will want to go there for nostalgia sake. He'll say things like, \"this pizza tastes like when my dad fell off the ladder\" or \"this reminds me of my estranged uncle getting pepperoni stuck in his beard, back when we all still talked.\" Yikes. And indeed, it does sort of taste like that. It tastes like, \"this'll do,\" or \"uh oh, bad day, let's grab literally any pizza we can because pizza always makes things better.\"

But sometimes we just gotta let those memories die and grab a slice of something we deserve. Pizza that tastes like pizza."}
{"text":"I've been \"hooked\" on the shack for more than 30 years.  I live in No VA but raised in pitt.  Pizza is very light.  Order a large square (16 cuts) and eat more than half!!  I ALWAYS stop here when returning to pitt. 
It's crazy pizza.  Pre-cooked shells,  topped with a unique  sauce that is indeed a bit sweet and shop graded mozzarella / provolone and i suspect a bit of cheddar.  
This pizza has managed to have a strong So. Hills following for more than 35 years.  What does this say?  Check it out."}
{"text":"Pizza at the Pizza Shack is definitely one of a kind and unlike anything else I've ever had. With that said, I do not recommend the pizza here if you do not like sweet sauce. I, however, am a fan of sweet sauce so I was so excited to try the pizza here. 

The crust is very buttery, almost like a pie crust. The sauce is sweet. In fact, it's very sweet. If you're familiar with the sauce at Fiori's, the sauce here is even sweeter than theirs. 

I really enjoyed my first few bites and definitely thought to myself that I could really enjoy this pizza. However, after a few more bites, the sweetness of the sauce became very overwhelming and I felt like I was eating a dessert. A smaller pizza might be enjoyable so it doesn't become too much sweetness. I think if I ever stop back here, I will definitely get the smallest size they have. Oh, and cash only!"}
{"text":"Only open Thurs, Fri, Saturday.

as for the pizza itself: The sauce is very good (if you like sweet sauces). Dough is average at best; very light density and a bit flaky. Probably one of my least favorite doughs. Cheese was alright; nothing special. 

Enjoyed it for one of the sweeter sauces in Pittsburgh, but overall I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"The hours are very limited, always a long wait and I'm unsure for what reason. The crust is obviously made ahead of time then they slap on the sweetest sauce I've ever put in my mouth. The cheese blend is the only good thing about the pizza. I guess if you like a non traditional pizza this may be for you but if you are looking for a good thin crust, or a traditional thick Pittsburgh pie, this isn't for you"}
{"text":"I tried Pizza Shack pizza years ago and I did not remember what I liked or did not like about it so I tried it again today. I really liked this pizza!  The crust is delicious and so is the cheese! The sauce is definitely sweeter than most pizza sauces.  Imagine a marinara that you have had on spaghetti that was quite sweet. If you like that taste, you will love this pizza. I will get it again because I think I may crave the sweet sauce every once in awhile. The prices are great! CASH only! It is directly across from Get Go on 51,  near Rowdy BBQ!"}
{"text":"I live no more than 5 minutes away from this place and only tried it for the first time last night. They have extremely odd hours. Thursday, Friday and Saturday 4-930. Even if you arrive at 4, expect a wait. This place gets PACKED and busy fast. 

I heard about this place for a while now and have been meaning to try it- but the hours threw me off. Well now I see what the fuss is all about! 

My mom went to get the pizza last night. She arrived around 6 and as she has been told in the past , there would be a long wait or she could take the pizza and bake it at home. Rather than wait an hour when she was hungry, she brought the pizza to be baked at our house. You bake at 425 degrees for about 15 minutes . 

When I first saw the pizza, I noticed that it is a square pizza which I usually dislike. Not anymore. This pizza was amazing. We ordered just the plain pizza and it did not lack in flavor. The crust was unlike anything I've ever had in a pizza- light, flaky, not so filling and overwhelming like a lot of crusts. The sauce was sweet and packed with flavor. You can taste that it's homemade and that the tomatoes are fresh. The cheese was awesome- mozzarella and provolone I believe. Amazing. After having 4 pieces,  I didn't feel uncomfortably full, I felt satisfied which is a much better feeling. 

I would love to give this place 5 stars, but there odd hours and the fact that they were closed 2 Thursdays in a row without as much as a sign on the door prevents me from doing so."}
{"text":"If your a fan of sweet sauce then this would be the place for you. I; however,  am NOT a fan of sweet sauce. It just was too too sweet for my liking. The crust was fantastic!!! It was thick but not heavy, and crunchy."}
{"text":"Someone I work with mentioned Pizza Shack in Pickering and said it is really traditional Italian pizza and that it no longer is located on Liverpool Road.  It is now located at 893 Bayly Street in Pickering.  I dropped in for a slice a week ago and had two because the first was just so damn good.  It is a fabulous crust and traditional sauce.  The cheese actually tastes like cheese with a bit of a bang to it.  On the weekend, I grabbed two large pizzas and they were simply great.
If you want something that is not doughy and thick and makes you want to sleep right after a bite, this is the place.  Don't expect some great meal deals etc....it is just a traditional good place to order from."}
{"text":"Great pizza at a great cost, Pizza Shack's uniquely sweet sauce is what keeps me coming back, and everyone who I've recommended them to agrees.  Highly recommended. No eating in, and very strange hours, however."}
{"text":"I am in love with this pizza! I wish they had better hours though. I look forward to this Wednesday just so I can get another pizza! If you aren't a fan of sweet sauce, this is not the pizza for you. I love the sweetness of this sauce. Definitely a must have in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Their unique \"sweet sauce\" is what keeps me from eating there. If you want sugar on your pizza then this is the pizza for you. I think I'll pass."}
{"text":"Love this place-been coming here since I was a kid-sweet sauce is homemade and the dough is not dense but light and flaky. Five stars. And much better than Danny's Pizza."}
{"text":"I had a bacon cheese burger with fries and a pop. I came close to close but they still made mine and my brothers burgers. The burgers were great but what stood out were the fries. The fries were so good. Honestly some of the best fries in town."}
{"text":"First of all, this is not a traditional pizza. If you like a sweet sauce and crispy crust, this place is for you. They also use a crumbly sausage that is great. I have been getting this pizza for over 25 years and it is always consistent. 

You will either love it or hate it, nothing in between. Just remember, they have limited hours, no delivery, serve only pizza, take out only..... And they have still stayed in business for over 25 years. That has to say something about the pizza.

Unfortunately, they have really funny hours. That is the only reason I gave them four stars."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. If you like sweet sauce then you need to try this pizza."}
{"text":"Coming from a town where you either eat Osso's Pizza or Hill House pizza I can understand the fact that this is a pizza you either like or hate.

Let's just say, I like it. I like the crust it's puffy and crisp around the edges, I like the sauce as well. It's sweet and not very jam like. And Carolyne, the cheese doesn't taste like rubber, just for the record.

Walking into Pizza Shack, which has incredibly limited hours, I loved it instantly. It's a little dark, really old and it says to me \"I've been here a long time, and there's a good reason for that.\"

Good and simple. The way things should be. From better times."}
{"text":"To some, this pizza is grotesquely saccharine. To others, it is blissfully bizarre. 

Almost a dessert, the neatly square pie (tart? sheet cake?) has a crust kindred to a puff pastry and a radiant red sauce sugary enough to fill a doughnut. The pale, thin, filmy cheese has a sharp flavor. The mushrooms are fresh, thickly cut, and are nearly raw. The pepperoni discs are flimsy, oily, and taste as if they are sliced to order. 

You see, as a South Hills dweller of many moons, I have sped by this establishment uncounted times with nary a thought. Tonight, I decided to neglect Pizza Shack no longer. 

Quite literally...a shack, it is thankfully occupied and is not emblazoned with a name that Pittsburghers will tell you conjures images of strangled suburban potential: LEVITSKE. 

Only pizza can be had here. There are no hoagies, wing-dings, mozzarella sticks, calzones, or any other such fare. 

No, Pizza Shack makes nothing but pizza, and although it will not be to everyone's tastes, I think they make it well.

My father HATED it. 

My mom didn't know what to think of it. 

I...liked it enough to at least rate it a solid 4. 

Standing in front of an oven of aged, brown brick and dark, lightly corroded iron doors, the man who took my money and handed over the pizza told me that Pizza Shack has been doing brisk business for 50 years, indicating that a customer base is obviously eating this pizza with fervid regularity.

Pizza Shack's pizza will ultimately either attract or repel you with a sweetness that flutters between felicity and vulgarity. I am drawn to it without being completely smitten. 

P.S. Pizza Shack is CASH AND TAKEOUT ONLY. They offer no dine-in or delivery. 

P.P.S. I'm not the only Darren who is a Pizza Shack fan. When I phoned in my order, I was mistaken for another Darren who routinely buys their pizza."}
{"text":"So I will admit that their pizza isn't traditional, but it is delicious in its own way. Most pizza is incredibly greasy, but this isn't. The crust is thick, the sauce is sweet and the cheese ratio is perfect. I have only ever gotten plain and you can't beat the price. My only complaint is they have very limited hours so are always extremely busy. I wish they were open more so that I can take care of my Pizza Shack craving whenever it hits."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever...Trust me, it's worth the drive and planning around their limited hours."}
{"text":"If you love sweet sauce then this pizza is for you! Once you taste it, you'll crave it, and be back for more. The hours aren't the greatest but the pizza is DELISH!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here for years! It is a cult following kind of place. The crust rocks, it has a semi sweet homemade sauce, and is THE BEST!!! If you need to step away from the cookie cutter commercial tasting pizza, try the Shack! I actually crave it 5 mins after finishing it!"}
