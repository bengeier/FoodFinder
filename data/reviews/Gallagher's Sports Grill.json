{"text":"What a horrible experience!!!!!

So I went to meet with a friend who was in town for her PHD program at Grand Canyon University.  She and several of her classmates decided to head to this hell hole for a friend's marriage proposal get together.  Since I worked all day, rushed home to wash up, and then headed straight there, I was hot and starving. 

They are overly disorganized.  My friend and her classmates reserved a certain amount of tables, and yet they were not already prepared for us.  We had to wait for them to finish putting the tables together.  Strike 1

Happy Hour had just finished and I was not in the mood to pay full price for a drink from such an establishment, so I had one of the cheap Moose Beer cans for $3.00, it was rather tasty, surprisingly.

So, the service here is very very very very slow!!!!!! I ordered the barbeque-bacon turkey burger, and it literally took an hour to come out! It did not look appealing and so I spoke with the manager, who was not very customer service driven.  Strike 2

When we were served our food, the silverware did not come along with it as well.  Strike 3
Since, I have worked in the restaurant industry and I wrote food and wine reviews and blogs, I know what is supposed to happy when a client is not happy with the service, or the food.  Apparently the manager did not know, he then took the food away and said that he would take it off of the bill.  He was supposed to leave the food, let me finally eat it, and then still take it off of the bill.  My friend had to go and hunt him down with my food and so he brought it back out.  But, I was so annoyed that I left it sitting right there, to prove a point that I was not that hungry to eat their trash food after waiting an hour and then having it taken away!!!

The waitress was frazzled, the manager was incompetent, and the sound system was horrible for karaoke.  They need to close down, re-train everyone, and hire more staff!!"}
{"text":"Great place to watch games and grub. Staff are professional and provide great service. They don't tolerate amateurs, drunks who like to bring their own Taco Bell into the bar and loud mouths. Makes it a great environment for the real customers who appreciate a drama free good time."}
{"text":"We sat down and waited forever, no one even addressed us. It was not busy so there's no reason for them to have such horrible service. Don't go here!"}
{"text":"Awesome wings! Try the raspberry chipotle...   Service is hit or miss, but ate on the patio today and had an exceptional server! Seriously, try the bone-in wings!"}
{"text":"Wings....eat the wings!! Be sure to ask for them grilled! It takes a little while longer to get them, but totally worth the wait. Aside from the wings, the Nachos are pretty tasty.

Other than that, it's a pretty standard sports bar. However, there are masses upon masses of TVs here, which makes it nice if you are wanting to watch a game. The downside: if the place gets busy, the servers are usually not equipped to handle it. Aside from the TVs, there is trivia, karaoke, and a pool table. Another major plus for us smokers: the outside patio, which includes MORE TVs. Weeeee! Sorry for the excitement, but TVs on the patio are hard to come by.

The food overall is average. A few things that are good. The burgers are solid, and you have the option of really customizing them (different meats, cheeses, buns, etc). The wraps are horrible! Old lettuce, dry and hard wrap. Icky.  Drinks are priced well.

I need a half star. YELP!!!! Yelp me! Listen to me! We need half stars!!!! This is a 3.5 star place.

{"text":"I was disappointed today when I arrived for lunch with a friend . I have been a regular customer at this location for the past 23 years.  I haven't been here since June 2017 and was disappointed to see that the menu has completely changed.  The menu no longer has our \"regular\" choices.  This includes Gallagher's spinach dip as well as numerous sandwich options. The sandwich options are very limited, maybe 10, with 2 being almost identical. The Philly (which has swiss cheese) which isn't a true Philly cheesesteak and the French dip. The only difference is that the Philly has peppers and onions. Pork is represented in 3 of the sandwich options.  No longer have pulled smoked turkey or chicken sandwiches.  The chicken quesadilla is not served with salsa anymore. Really? This is AZ. Everything should come with salsa. The service remains good to excellent.  We spend a significant amount of days here during football season but will look to other options instead of this being our regular Sunday meeting place.  Bring back the old menu!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for lunches, especially if you are hungry. Most everything seems huge here- burgers, sandwiches, ribs, helpings of fries... and everything is fairy fresh and good. Today I asked for the spinach salad with grilled shrimp instead of the offered chicken - hey that was a great move - resulted in probably the best meal I've had here. 

Service is consistently adequate - never more, never less. Fast enough to allow for in and out for lunch in about 40 minutes. Don't expect engaging conversation or bright witty comments from your servers - they do their jobs and that's about it. 

I haven't been here other than for lunches, so cannot comment on the bar scene."}
{"text":"So this is my first review because it is hard for me to review restaurants. Having worked in the industry for years i am a little more forgiving than most. So we ordered calamari, it came out black but being adventurous i tried it thinking it was a different kind of breading. Boy was i wrong! It was completely burnt. So we sent it back our other food came out and then the new calamari came out.  Much better this time until we got down to the plate. It was the old plate, same lettuce same number lemons we squeezed on the batch. As some one who has cooked for a living i want to know how lazy a person has to be to do that. Probably won't be going back for a while if at all."}
{"text":"Fun place, yummy food and a great place to watch football. Very attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"I came for lunch. Very clean,  nice ambiance, the food was very good. But the service was slow.  We had to get back to work and we were late getting back."}
{"text":"It's a sports bar type of place.
The service has always been good to me here.  :)
Food is standard for a bar but pretty good. Try the wings.
On karaoke night there is this older gentleman who belts out all your favorite grunge tunes from the 90's. I don't like karaoke but this is a treat, hahaha"}
{"text":"Way to go Cards!!! My party consisted of 25 screaming Cardinal fans.( I had made reservations 3 days prior) So, when we walked in our table was ready
and our waitress was standing there to take our drink order! Every aspect of our experience was spot on!!! The Nacho's were Da Bomb! We never had to wait for anything! Here is the one downfall... there are T.V.s in the Men's  room but not the woman's... what the hell.... I jokingly complained and the management said for you it will be rectified!  Gallagher's you complete me!! 
We will be back! And when College football starts again we will be turning this into a \"buckeyes\" bar!"}
{"text":"Came here with a party of 12 on a Friday night. Place was not busy. We were seated quickly but then the waiting began. Our waiter worked hard, but should have had more help. The kitchen was out of several items, including fish and baked potatoes. We were told they'd adjust the bill, but that didn't happen. Food was just ok. I'd skip this place."}
{"text":"July 5th while dining at Gallaghers on 7575 n 16 St there was a cockroach in our water. While the waiter was fantastic in handling this disgusting discovery the manager did not bother to come and talk to us and decided that comping one domestic beer and  a 6 dollar happy hour entree was sufficient. In addition, one of the handles on the toilet in the ladies restroom (handicap stall) was broken off the toilet, which did not allow the toilet to flush. Had the manager come and talked to us, I believe this situation could have be solved in a suitable manner. However, now there is a party of five who will never recommend Gallaghers to anyone and will now be  reporting this incident to  the health department."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer but the service sucks plan accordingly and add an additional hour to get you food and anybody to come and take your order and bring your bill.  This has happened on more than one occasion. Don't care to ever come back."}
{"text":"love this place :) it's just down the street from our house and we love to stop in there for a drink or to watcha  game, they recently got new tv's so it's gotten even nicer now that football season is here.  I love the mini g sliders, I recommend getting the double patti version thought so you have a good bun to burger ratio :)  food is good, service is great and it's all walks of life in there as far as customers go so you'll always be entertained.  even if you see the parking lot is packed there is a TON of seating so don't let that fool you ..."}
{"text":"The service was poor, the food was less than decent.  Had to ask for a drink 3 times and after the third time the waitress was snippy and said the bartender was feisty.  The specialty fish I ordered fried was way overcooked and never was it offered to get seconds.  Was just very disappointed.  We arrived on a Friday night after a high school football game a group of 6 and there weren't very many other people in there so we thought the service could have been a little more prompt."}
{"text":"If you're betting on horses this is the place. The drinks strong and the servers provided great service asking my name and calling me by name the whole time. I really only went here to bet on the derby. The food was not anything to write home about but the beer and liquor is endless. Great atmosphere, it is a nice little cut spot to chill and unwind. 

Give it a look see!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Portions were really good. Our server Whitney was the best she smiled the whole time and always came back and asked us if we needed anything. She is a true asset to this place. We will come back every time we are in town!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a convention nearby. 

The bartender was very inattentive and rude. 

When we were at the bar the bartender and her manager were talking badly about our group. 

They were trash talking our cause and one reassured the other that \"they are leaving tomorrow, so we only have to put up with them for a little longer\". 

Will not return."}
{"text":"Back for WINGS again. GO with the boneless honey BBQ during happy hour. They are the best."}
{"text":"Why is that I keep happening to think that driving down 16th Street in this no man's land of north-central Phoenix will allow me to Yelp about undiscovered establishments, when obviously I come back home and log on to find that at least three other fine Yelping compadres have already been to these seemingly obscure and random places? I must say I'm really  impressed.

In any case, my foray into this Gallagher's (Food and Fun!) was due to an office goodbye party and not just 'cause I ended up there for happy hour by myself (just in case you were wondering). 

It's a decent neighborhood sports bar, packed for happy hour and emptying out quickly after 7 if there's no game on. You can tell it's a place that used to be real smoky before May 1st (just by looking at the crowd there), but they still haven't put water misters out on their patio yet to cool down all those banished puffers. Pretty much you could tell by walking in that everyone there for happy hour was a longtime local regular, save maybe a curious out-of-towner staying at the Pointe Hilton across the street. The girls who were serving were all friendly, and they handled our group professionally and courteously as the evening wore on and us folks got louder, drinks got spilled, and sense wasn't exactly being made. 

We ordered a few items to share, none of it healthy, except for the veggie platter (carrot sticks, celery, cherry tomatoes, and, randomly, a pile of raw sliced mushrooms). We also had the Sampler (deep fried fried mozzarella sticks, deep fried chicken tenders, deep fried jalapeno poppers, deep fried button mushrooms, deep fried onion strings, deep fried...well, you get the picture) and two different kinds of boneless hot wings. All were decent enough.

FACT: They serve Sammy Hagar's Cabo Wabo tequila for anyone who remotely cares about Sammy Hagar.

FACT: You can sit on a stool here and do NTN Buzztime trivia with your Playmaker gadget by yourself till the cows come home. It's true. I saw one dude sitting by us for hours, happily trivia-ing alone while sipping on his Diet Coke for eons.

FACT: If you're a dude, and you gotta hit the john, you have the choice of watching ESPN or ESPN2 on flat panel screens depending on where you choose to handle your business. Word from my group was that the women's bathroom was equally flat panelly-equipped in the stalls, except there was disappointment that they were stuck watching Oprah or some other show with feelings. This whole paragraph will only matter to those who take restaurant/bar bathrooms and Oprah way seriously. 

All in all, I'm not sure whether Gallagher's (Food and Fun!) would come to the forefront of my brain when I think of places to go out to for the night, but it's good for what it is and I could see it being a decent enough joint to catch a game or two. 

3 stars (more like 3.49)."}
{"text":"Gallagher's is a-ok with me! I've visited Gallagher's on several occasions and it's your average neighborhood pub. I don't think the food is AMAZING but it's good and washes down nice and easy with a cold beer! The cookie with ice cream is YUMMY. I love the peanut butter cookie. It's amazing and can easily be shared by a couple people. 
The thing they might fall a bit short on is service. I'm not saying service is horrible, but it's not highly attentive all of the time. It can really be hit or miss. Another issue is if you set by the back patio, all the smoke from outside gets sucked inside whenever someone opens that door. Maybe one of those blowers that is activated every time someone opens the door would cut back on the smoke entering the bar? Just a thought. 

Overall I like Gallagher's it's a great place for some bar food and few beers."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon we stopped by Gallagher's for the first time for a couple of drinks after running errands and we ultimately stopped there because of the patio, as it was nice and wanted to sit outside. After we chose a seat, a waiter came out and said he would be with us in a couple of minutes. There was only one other table on the patio that was finished (I saw the check holder on the table) and a few people sitting at the inside bar and maybe 3-4 tables total in the entire restaurant. We sat there was about 5 minutes before he came back out and placed our order for two drinks.  He asked if we wanted menus and we declined.  He said he would be out shortly with the drinks.  
Well, needless to say it wasn't shortly.  We sat there for at least 10 minutes (closer to 15) before I went inside to use the restroom. I passed by the bar and saw the bartender chatting with three guys at the bar and looked around and saw only one other table.  All the servers were in the kitchen talking.  When I came back from the restroom, I saw my drink sitting up on the well window but not the beer that my husband had ordered.  I walked up to the bartender and said is this a vodka diet and the bartender was just opening my husbands beer.  This has now been close to 20 minutes.  He said it is right here and said its possibly my fault.(meaning himself) My confusion on this is based on the fact that it took that long to get two drinks made (one of which was a bottle of beer) when there was no one in there but a few people sitting at the bar that he was talking to...he gave me the beer and I grabbed my drink and started to walk back out to the patio when the server saw me and followed me out.  He profusely apologized and said he couldn't really tell the bartender what to do.  (I spent 15 years in the business, bartending, serving and managing, so this is false) and also don't make excuses to the customer period.  During this time, another couple came and sat down on the patio.  They were there for 15 minutes and not one person came out to greet them or take their order.  They left!  There was a dirty table sitting there the entire time we were there which is ridiculous considering there was nothing going on.  Our server came out shortly after with two drinks in his hand (we didn't order them) so we thought they might have been a comp or something, but no we were charged for them even though we didn't order them.  
We asked for our check and paid and left.  I don't normally write reviews of any kind, but when a place is slow is when the service is the worst.  It wasn't catastrophic by any means, but the patio isn't enough to bring me back to this place."}
{"text":"Sorry, but it's just really, really awful. The main issue is the food. We had everything from Cobb Salad to ribs to fish and chips and it was all equally bad. Nothing seems fresh at all. The fish was probably just pulled out of the Shamrock foods bag and fried (along with the fries). The Cobb salad was dry and wilted. The pulled pork was dry as well, like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for too long. The same can be said of the entire restaurant, it's been sitting out too long. The decor is dated, the carpet is stained and you really shouldn't have carpet in a restaurant anyway. The menus were all greasy. The service was fine, but just. Do yourself a favor, walk on by unless you just want a couple of beers in front of the numerous tv's blasting Sports Center."}
{"text":"Hit or miss food. I ordered the meat plate with corned beef, zuch and asparagus for the sides. Corned beef was WAY too salty, and same thin style you get on a sandwich. I sent it back for a chicken breast bone in, which was the driest chicken I have ever had. The side veggies were good (perfectly grilled no butter), and accompanied by garlic bread. I think this place has potential but I ordered wrong. I sat at the bar and service was mediocre. Price was pretty low though. Good place to watch the game."}
{"text":"I lasted all of 5-10 minutes in there before I walked out. Went to the bar to order a beer and an app, bartender just walked up and stood in front of me, not saying a word (which is an interesting way to take an order). Which is kind of funny cause a few seconds prior to this I had heard the guy next to me complaining to another guy about how the bartender wasn't communicating with him at all and another guy (who I assumed was a regular) just said \"ah that's just him, you're lucky if he talked to you at all\". LOL, fantastic.  After I ordered, he just stuck his hand out, which I guess meant he wanted to see my ID, so I reach in my wallet to grab it and he stares off at the opposite end of the room watching the Celtics game and I end up just placing it in his hand. Once he's done watching the game, he studies my ID for about 45 seconds like it's written in ancient hieroglyphics (Im 35 and look it, mind you).

After he finally decides to give my ID back to me he rings up the ticket and places it in front of me, then starts serving other people drinks, then starts serving other people food, then he leaves the bar and starts bussing a table. Seriously, why is the bartender leaving the bar to clean tables when you have at least 2 other servers (by my count) working a restaurant that is really not that busy. Pouring a beer takes 10 seconds and even if you can't get to it right away, at least for the sake of the most basic customer service skills say \"hey sorry bud, it'll be just a minute\". 

I generally just brush this kind of stuff off, but if your bartender (the person who's generally supposed to be the most friendly and accommodating) is known for being willfully apathetic,  I can't imagine there's anything behind the scenes worth sticking around for."}
{"text":"We had a large party! There was maybe 15-20 of us and more kept coming and going at the end.  The server was attentive and we got our food order relatively at the same time. I ordered the flatbread and it took a bit longer to come out then the other food my friends got. Most people got burgers and fries. My flatbread was worth the wait though! It sauce drizzle on top make it 10 times better. I am so glad I order it! We also got a round of shots since it was half off. This is a chill environment to hang out and watch a game."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is terrible. Unless you're coming her for drinks only to enjoy a sports game, I would highly suggest going elsewhere. The service was terrible, slow, and unfriendly. I had the chili and it was very watery and the cheese wasn't melted. My boyfriend got the fish n chips and it appeared to be frozen fish sticks. The nachos had the same problem of unmelted cheese and the tiniest scoop of guacamole in the middle that was enough for about three chips. No one checked on us throughout our meal. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"The food is poorly prepared, over cooked and hard fried.  Service was shameful.  I was by myself and practically ignored.  Go somewhere else.  The prices aren't that great.  There are plenty of better establishments for drinks and appetizers."}
{"text":"Great service- friendly staff. We went twice on our trip to AZ and the first time we had the Reuben and the gallaburger which were excellent! Try the waffle fries. Second time around the nachos weren't the greatest. Other than that I would go back."}
{"text":"Ok, you must try their Chocolate Porter, its a local beer and delish!

Their bar food is really good and yes, even the salmon dinner is sooooo good!

The beers are ice cold, right carbonation and ever flowing 

The service we received was top notch and when im back in Phoenix, Ill be paying them another visit!"}
{"text":"Hooray for another bar I can stumble home from!
 Finally ventured in after nearly two years of living in the neighborhood. My already half-drunk, starving cohorts and I were very impressed with the extensive menu..Chicken Fried Steak? Yes Please. Chicken Fried Chicken? Yes please. I strongly support anything fried anything. And believe you me, that's what you will get when you come here. So dieters may want to stay away. 
Service was friendly, not the fastest. The poor guy seemed like he had to wait on the entire bar area so I could hardly get angry with him. 
Price seemed a little high-I guess that's what you get for ordering margaritas at a sport's bar. And a completely needless enormous sampler appetizer of fried goodies to share along with your fried entrees. 
A good neighborhood hangout, I will be back to continue my assault on my digestive track."}
{"text":"Normally I love this place but today management failed. They were understaffed to a criminal degree which is bad for employees and patrons. Its not like the Derby came as a surprise.

Never coming back for a special event here. I did go to the 7th St and Union Hills location for Preakness and had a MUCH better experience. Get your act together on 16th St and I could be persuaded to try again."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Slow food delivery. No doubt, their thinking is slow food and you drink more which is higher margin. Place where the local alcoholics drop in to get their fix. Expensive for what you get. It's not dirty and there a lot of people eating and drinking. You will hear a lot of exchanges between staff and patrons that are merely shallow attempts to establish familiarity. They don't know each other."}
{"text":"Here's to you, mr. neighborhood-sports-bar-floor-manager!  They were training a new server, who was from New York, so she came replete with a touch of attitude, and not enough training.  Thankfully, middle management saved the day!  The question was whether the nachos (do NOT order, by the way, they're borderline inedible, but then i don't particularly like nachos under the best of circumstances) contain beans, even if you order them with chicken instead of refried beans on top.  Somehow, someway, we got confused and assumed they did.  Our server, upon being complained at, simply walked away without a word.  Needless to say, there were comments made at our table.  That's when middle management stepped in.  He explained that it's an either-or proposition, enlightening us.  He then went above and beyond, bringing us a cup of the delicious refried beans (which I tried despite my distaste for the whole nacho thing and found to be completely and totally 100% awesome).  Thank you, sir!  At some point, I ordered a burger, which I wholeheartedly enjoyed.  It's enjoying me right now, quite enthusiastically, I might note.  *gurgle*

Anyway, I don't have a great feeling about this place's future in my repertoire of places to drink.  If the unsung hero isn't there to help you out, the service will not be good.  No attitude, per se, just poor service, which is possibly more unforgivable in my book.  The perfect storm is poor service with attitude, but for that you gotta go to Pomeroy's (can we go back there again soon so I can find justification to SLAM that place in my update? please?)  The environment is typical sports bar, with a moderately clean bathroom (thank you again, unsung hero!).  The food is very uneven, even for a sports bar.  Those fries should not be heavily salted.  I don't care who likes them that way, I will not eat them covered in salt.  I will not eat them with a malt.  I do not like them, not one bit!

Anyway, I don't have any particularly hostile feelings towards this place.  My burger was good, the beer selection was decent and the prices were (in theory, at least) great.  Give that floor manager a fancy set of whip and chains and...  I dunno, redecorate?  somehow import some atmosphere someway, i don't know or care how, and this place will get more stars.  I should note that I am quite sure they messed up my check.  The beers were supposed to each be $4, in fact I carefully ensured that each beer I ordered (ok, that might be a total lie) was a $4 beer, and yet my bill came to $26.  I only had three, plus a nine-dollar burger.  I don't think they were trying to rip me off, but as a cheap person, I find this slightly offensive.  Granted, I'm partially to blame for not, I dunno, reading the bill when I got it?  anyway, I'll forgive you, this time, Gallagher's, but you're on my watch list.  You eff me over one time, you win an all-expense paid trip to the Gitmo of my \"recommended avoid\" list.  Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"One star only due to the fact I cannot give a negative score.  Walked in on a Thursday evening with my wife, to a pretty nice looking local bar that was not very busy.  We ordered a couple drinks then ordered a burger.

Meanwhile my drink ran dry so I was asked if I would like another and the answer was yes.  10-15 minutes later we finally saw our waitress and she said she forgot to put it in.  My reaction was don't bother just cancel it.  The burger we ordered from finally came after about 20 minutes and was rare as rare can be.  Nothin against a rare burger, but I was splitting with my wife and she prefers medium.

At that point I had enough, I settled for the two drinks and left.  If you are visiting the Hilton resort you will see your options are limited on the resort, my advice is to skip this place.  I was not the only one in the bar sending things back, we witnessed at least one other."}
{"text":"Great sports bar / restaurant. Very clean. Tv's for every seat in the house. Bartender was great and attentive.  Food was delicious and plentiful. Off track betting, pool tables, dart boards. Good patio for smoking, with Tv's as well. Clean bathroom, with Tv's as well. Perfect for cardinal fans.

I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Good food, beer, service, sports on TV and prices. Not too bad.  What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Had a really bad experience. Went with a group of 5 for dinner, service was poor, the food wasn't very good either. We spent most of our time waiting. Our appetizer was the last thing brought out, no apology, no discount, no customer service."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good, price was rite. They had this raspberry mayo for the sweet potato fries..really creative and yumny. Lots of chicken wing sauce choices...i like to try new things. I will go back."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab a drink or two, but food is typical of what you should expect in a sports bar. If a meal is not on you to do list, then I would recommend  this place."}
{"text":"We arrived at the resort across the street for check-in at 9:30 PM after a long airplane flight -- half an hour before the resort's restaurants closed for the evening.  We missed dinner due to the time of our flight and were starving.

Since we hadn't rented a vehicle, we searched Yelp for places within walking distance that were open late. Two nearby options turned up: a tex-mex place down the street and Gallaghers.  We tried the tex-mex place first (Aunt Chiladas; reviewed separately).  Despite that location's restaurant's website stating it was open until 2am, we were dismayed to find out that they only serve alcohol after 10pm. We asked the bartender about Gallaghers (and any other nearby alternatives) and he told us to avoid Gallaghers like the plague.  Funny--our cabbie from the airport said the place was greasy but a local favorite.

We decided to risk it...and I'm glad we did.  Gallagher's has a dining room separate from the bar.  We arrived around 10:30pm, and there were two other groups enjoying meals. The dining room was dimly lit and felt like it belonged in a cold Midwest metropolis--kinda like a Chicago/Detroit version of Cheers.  The bar (which we never visited) sounded busy and happy with loud music that battled with the dining room's music to make a pleasant cacophony of white noise.  We were exhausted, and the seats were comfy...the hostess was VERY attentive (but not pushy), and instantly brought us large fresh glasses of water. 

As for the food.  We ordered the appetizer platter (fried mushrooms, zucchini, onion rings and mozzarella sticks). It was wonderful, plentiful, not too greasy (despite being all fried food), and piping hot with crispy fried batters. My husband ordered the cheeseburger. He loved it.  I felt yucky from my half day of traveling, so I ordered a small spinach salad. The salad could have been wonderful, with thinly sliced sweet red onions, crispy bacon pieces, mushrooms, almond slivers, and an oriental dressing on the side. Unfortunately, the spinach was beyond dry, and did not seem like it had been washed.  The mushrooms looked like they had been picked from the grocer's bin and chopped without inspection, washing, or even wiping with a wet cloth.  I swear I could see bits of the manure on a few slices.  As I dug below the surface of the salad, I identified several spinach leaves which were close to a gelatinous state. 

In short--the service was great, the grilled/fried food is wonderful, the atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Will definitely go again..maybe try their pizza or wings.  

I learned two things--never order a salad from a bar (unless it is a salad bar), and always trust a cabbie's opinion over that of a competing bartender."}
{"text":"Pretty much your average sports bar, but their $1 shrimp tacos every Tuesday are what keeps bringing us back. That and the fact that they always have Red Sox games on (or put them on when I ask nicely).

It's a good place to hang out in a casual atmosphere, with no frills. Don't expect anything to fancy, although they have a pretty substantial menu.

You kind of get the feeling when you walk in that everyone is a regular (Cheers), and that you'll get strange looks for being an intruder, but everyone is always pleasant and we've been back several times."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service on Game day!  We were all excited to see our Cardinals play and eat breakfast - the server took awhile before he acknowledged us after we sat down and we asked for a breakfast menu and he said he'd have to \"find\" one.  He took orders from the folks next to us and brought us the drinks they ordered- no further explanation of the breakfast menus - just totally ignored us.  We left and went to Aunt Chilada's down the street!"}
{"text":"Well it was St. Patrick's day and I could not think of anywhere to go but here, that might be celebrating. Oh the were definately into it up in here! haha patrons and staff were both decked out for the day in green and with hats, tee-shirts, plastic jewlery and just about anything you can find related to the day.The crowd was happy and I talked to a lot more people than on the average stop in. The dining room and bar were both filled. The Irish music was filling the place, the green beer was flowing as one might expect at a discounted rate. There was a corn beef & cabbage plate special being offered up as well as the usual menu items and the Wed .40 cent wing deal they now have started. There was St Paddys day decoration and give aways from happy hour into the evening. A fun and lively pub it was. My only complaint was that drinks were all being served in limp little plastic cups; mixed drinks and the beer."}
{"text":"I was at a wedding yesterday at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort in Phoenix and had about 45 minutes to eat before our event. Emily and I went over to Gallagher on a recommendation from the event manager at the hotel. 

We sat down at the bar and were greeted right away, we had two waters to drink and they served them in big glasses which I always love ( I am a big water drinker) 

The menus came and we asked the bartender her favorite items. She suggested the San Antone Chicken. Wow I was very impressed for 12.99 I got Two boneless chicken breasts, grilled and basted with   BBQ sauce, topped with diced bacon, diced tomato, melted monterey jack cheese, and green onions. Served over a chipotle cream sauce. 

I was really impressed with the food, very moist chicken cooked perfectly. The combination of the BBQ with the chicken and melted cheese was awesome. My sides were veggies and a twice baked potato that was really tasty

Emily had a burger that looked really good, and I had one of her cris cut fries, yum!

I give this place 4 stars for how quickly they got us in and out, and since the bartenders two favorite items were a hit, a big thanks to her also! 

If i am ever back in this area I will be back."}
{"text":"Although it looks old on the outside, the inside is clean and very open. Stopped in to grab lunch for coworkers and myself. I ordered the pulled porker with a side of waffle fries. The waffle fries were very crispy just the way I like and the pulled porker was really yummy but the ciabatta bread was really dry so I ate it without the bread."}
{"text":"If 50 stars was an option Whitney the bartender working today would get it. Her amazing service and honest care was something that is extremely rare to find nowadays. Hands down an amazing woman and lucky business to have her!!!"}
{"text":"Beer selection was good and waiter was nice enough, but the food was terrible.  Nacho cheese was wiz and buffalo chicken tenders were undercooked. Not sure why, as it took forever for meal to arrive.  Good place for a beer, skip the food."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's always comfortable and service is great.  Food was awesome and coldest beers in town."}
{"text":"I was craving wings.  Decided to stop by on my way.  Sat down greeted by the bartender.  She gave us water and a beer.  Left us a late night menu, then never saw her again at our table for 30 min.  The waiter walked by countless times but never stopped to ask us if everything ok, would you like to order food.  He said nothing to us.  But went around to all other tables.  Bartender went had a cigarette played on her phone but never asked us if we were doing ok or what would you like to order(since we specifically asked for a menu).   By the way my husband ordered a bud light, not sure what was given to him but it was gross.  Never had the opportunity to tell anyone since we were ignored.  So I walked out.  Sad thing is I am a long time customer of Gallaghers, so sad this location cannot get it together."}
{"text":"I pass by this place every day on my way back to hotel so decided to check it out early this week.  Food is alright, but the staffs are friendly and awesome, not to mention most of them are hot!  It's good to have a few drinks and walk back to the hotel."}
{"text":"A large group of us met up for happy hour on a Friday evening and we will definitely be back! The food was great and service was impeccable. Great happy hour specials. Gallagher's is rebranding and the new place is looking good."}
{"text":"Most of the time there is only 1 or 2 servers working, so the service is not that great.  However, I love the Tortilla Club Wrap and their seasoned fries (dipped in chipotle ranch).  Do not order the sliders... they tasted wierd.  It never gets packed.  A lot of the regulars go there for the Off-Track Betting.  During the football season it is a great low key place to watch the game if you don't want to deal with all those loud and obnoxious fans."}
{"text":"The food is good and the tvs are everywhere, but the best part is the staff.  Dan and the team took great care of us.  My nephew is allergic to dairy and they bent over backwards to make sure he was safe and we all were well fed."}
{"text":"Sad, outdated decor. Regulars (?) hanging out using the \"F\" word a lot.

Was told the kitchen was closed, then they decided it was open. Should have kept it closed. I ordered nachos. They were terrible. Some stale chips and a miserly amount of cheese, $10. Seriously."}
{"text":"Ugh, this place needs new management. There is no hostess, yet it's open seating. Nobody tells you that and you find yourself wandering around wondering what you are supposed to do. 

Service is slow. The manager was not very polite when we had a problem with our food. In fact, he kind of gave us an attitude. 

We saw people walking out left and right because they didn't get services, and this was in the middle of the week. It was supposed to be \"kids eat free night\". We didn't specifically go there for this, but thought it was a bonus. They didn't take the kids meals off our bill. We were there so long that we just paid and left without complaining. 

The food was nothing to cheer about. This is probably at the very bottom of our list of places to eat when the world ends."}
{"text":"We made a mistake going there. My wife read lousy reviews but went anyway since close to hotel and a place to watch basketball. The food was not good and wife felt sick next day. Very bland boneless wings that were small pieces and no flavor. The pizza was acceptable. The lettuce was terrible. Limp is one way to describe it. The baked potato was served on a bed of ?We were not sure what it was. Service was fine . Beer cold. It was odd that twice they came to our table trying to deliver someone else's food. We did watch basketball and had many televisions."}
{"text":"Food is horrendous, but the worst part is the SERVICE IS TRASH. The manager with the beard is a robot with no knowledge in how to treat customers. Lady bartender is always giving beading eyes. The place is run by novices."}
{"text":"Average sports bar fare. Had the happy hour tacos for $5, not much chicken. Good attentie service and big table for larger parties. Friends like the fried cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight, will never be back.

The food is typical bar food, nothing too extraordinary, I already knew what to expect from previous visits. But the service was beyond bad.

Just an obvious example of poor training and poor management. Our poor server was obviously sent out to the wolves and had never served before.. (mind you she had 2 tables.) 

The most annoying part, was that the manager literally went to the table in the middle of the restaurant, SAT down with them, and explained that this server was new and had messed up stuff earlier.. I could hear the entire conversation. How unprofessional can you be? I understand we were at a \"sports bar\" but to throw your own employess under the bus is just messed up. 

Not only that but why couldnt they maybe come around to every single table (3) and see if they needed anything? Or maybe HELPED out your servers rather than needing them to go and find you while you are outside smoking? Ridiculous.

Id like to be able to say \"Oh it was a busy night I understand.\" But this was obsurd, at one point I even went to the bartender to ask for my sons water (The server brought out all the alcoholic beverages BEFORE bringing my sons water) And the bartender gave me a look like I was asking for her to do backflips, told me she didn't have \"To go cups\" and rolled her eyes.

This place obviously doesn't work as a team, and it shows..
Never mind the crappy food, dont go here just plain and simple because the service absolutely sucks and the management and other employess obviously do not care how their restaurant is portrayed."}
{"text":"Best boneless wings ever. Great staff and great prices"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place (other than it is walking distance to a resort that I frequent) are the waitresses and bartenders, who are cute and friendly. Otherwise the place pretty much sux. The food is mediocre at best. The vibe is lame. The worst part is that they do karaoke there alot, and it is loud and obnoxious. This place has pretty much run it's course. Time for it to close and re-open as something else. Hopefully under new ownership. And minus the karaoke."}
{"text":"Food and service was never 5 Stars, but food has really gone downhill. New and much shorter menu. Still a decent place to get a burger and a quick beer, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Gallaghers has never really been considered a nice bar... I do not know many people who would consider this a staple. Its there, if you ever need it...

~Fud/Drinks~
The food is bland. Lets just call it as it is. Salads are a best example as to how a restaurant treats its menu. If its got good salads, then they must have amazing entrees. Well this works well for Gallagher's, because their salads are meh meh meh. I tried a Greek salad, which for some reason, comes with iceberg lettuce, crispy, dry, iceberg lettuce. SERIOUSLY!? All the other ingredients including the feta  tasted like they just came out of the box/can they were shipped in. Horrible food choices besides the salads. Greasy, overpriced bar foods that really serve no purpose than to make you fat. Lets just say the ingredients in all their foods are lacking significantly. The drinks are typical bar options. Beer selection is OK, nothing stellar, but at least they carry some local options. But nothing to note that will turn heads, just average.

~Atmosphere~
There is no atmosphere really. Like an Applebee's, they put things on the wall and expect that to make the atmosphere of the room. No, it doesn't. There really is no ambiance or significant feel, its weird being that its a sports bar. The carpets are drab, by the way... just wanted  to point out that does not add to the experience. Waitstaff are pretty attentive, they do an OK job. But ya, the crowds aren't lively, and I can definitely name some other places you can feel the true sports-bar experience at. 

~Extras/Rating~
There is really nothing to add, other than the fact that an amazing resort, the Pointe Hilton, is literally a 1 minute walk away. They have amazing food options there, although its not sports oriented. They do have the Hole-in-the Wall restaurant as well, which is amazing western Bar-B-Q. Go there, honestly. This place gets two stars for being an average/below average sports bar chain with nothing much to offer. Their business model needs an update, there are some outstanding local pubs and eateries out here that loyal clients flock to."}
{"text":"This was a fun place to spend the day of st patricks...did a little gambling as they have off track wagering, though the mutual made a couple mistakes with our bets losing us $200 plus...which is why you should always check your ticket at the window!  HMPH..oh well, we had the corn beef n cabbage which was NOT cooked long enough, and I had a burger which was eh...nothing to write home about. The bartender kept pulling up her skirt and showing the guys at the bar her st patty's day panties...oh well, guess you have to get attention somehow...it was close to the hotel ....would go back if I stayed at this hotel again.."}
{"text":"Cheap Good drinks! Not a fancy place by any means, but if you're looking for a happy hour that's really laid back and super inexpensive, this is your place! The staff aren't the happiest at all, but its about 50/50 with the servers about half being polite and the other half just acting like they really didn't want to be there much less serve you. However when drinks are $2.75 a piece, this girl isn't complaining!"}
{"text":"Gallagher's is a good sports bar, I'll stop in for lunch from time to time and have been there for a few Sunday football games. They offer a lot of TV's to watch whatever game you want. The stools like most bars I find very uncomfortable, however, they have bench seating along the walls. The food is good, not great, but good, you won't be disappointed but won't get overly exciting. The buffalo Chicken Pizza is pretty awesome but could also kill you. The staff is friendly and accommodating and they have a decent selection of beers and daily specials."}
{"text":"Although I love Gallagher's and this is my neighborhood standby for a quick and easy frothy adult beverage with friends, I was first leaning toward giving only four stars -- mainly because the quality of the \"fresher\" elements of the food (i.e. lettuce, jalapenos, etc.) is not especially consistent. But, after thinking about what I would include in my write up I decided I have to go with five stars. Here's why: 

*FREE cookie sundae with the purchase on an entree on Sundays (Half-baked Chocolate Chip, White Chocolate Macadamia Nut or Peanut Butter with Chocolate Chip cookie topped with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. You can mix it up with two and go 1/2 and 1/2!) 

*Build your own burger - not only can you pick your \"meat\" but you can pick your \"bun\" and your bun can be a bed of lettuce allowing for less guilt over the fries. I'm partial to the Greek Burger (topped with feta cheese, diced tomato, black olives, and a side of cucumber sauce) made with a turkey patty on a bed of lettuce. 

*Karaoke on Saturday nights and, if you want, you'll easily get to sing more than once! (I, however, do not sing. I'm pretty sure I could get paid NOT to sing -- even at karaoke. I like to watch and make requests!!) 

* Generally not a problem getting a seat and TVs are EVERYWHERE! But, when it really counts, Gallagher's graciously took a reservation for the play off game and, actually had \"Reserved For...\" signs on the tables. The manager was very courteous, even when some of our group were slow to arrive. For this, Gallagher's has secured its place as my \"#1 go to watch a game\" spot for all time. 

P.S. If your preference is \"fake cheese\" nachos, as mine is, then hands-down these are the best nachos in the Valley. (If you like real cheese on your nachos, you are on your own!!)"}
{"text":"Oh Gallagher's, you are the every-man bar... you have beer, fried food, sometimes trivia  or karaoke, and you're A-OK.

There's a Gallagher's in every town.  It's not called Gallagher's in every town, of course, but there's always that one, casual, sports-ish bar that locals like, where friends meet up, and you can be comfortable in whatever. Bars like these rely on consistently good service, friendly prices, and a laid-back crowd to keep their patrons happy.  Gallagher's succeeds on all these fronts and doesn't pretend to be anything else. 

If you go to Gallagher's expecting cold beers, decent bar food, friendly servers, and a relaxed vibe - you'll have a great time.  Take my advice and leave the drama, attitude, and Ed Hardy wardrobe at home."}
{"text":"Great beers on tap and a solid place to watch a game, but the food is below par."}
{"text":"They  were ok the specials are really good and as we stayed by at a close by hotel it was convenient enough. The service is ok not too many happy energetic people around don't know if there's a on duty manager as we were there multiple times a day and never had a table touched by anyone other than the server.  Tried to order steak off the menu but I guess they haven't updated the menus yet ? With more personality would be an easy 4 stars. I liked I but didn't love it."}
{"text":"Good place to hang out and finish up some work. Relaxed atmosphere with lots of locals mixed in with travelers. 

Would recommend 100%"}
{"text":"Best waste of a Saturday night, the fact that the place was empty should have really sent the red flags flying! Meal made it to the table before the appetizer, soup and salad and yet the nonchalant attitude regarding the issue really baffled me (this is not a new place of business) anyway, don't waste your time and money here!
It is too bad that there are no zero stars options."}
{"text":"Nice folks. Good place to go watch a game. Drinks were a little h2O'y but decent aps, bar food.   Kind of dead but it seemed like many places in Phoenix are these days.  Likely a function of the economy and the degree to which Phoenix is overbuilt."}
{"text":"whenever I'm in town, I go to this place pretty much every night (because it's across from the pointe hilton).

I don't know of anywhere in my area that has the trivia/touch screen games anymore.  I sit here and play poker online and bluff my way to beating everybody's ass most of the time.  Great fun!"}
{"text":"Several of us Yelpers gathered to watch the Cardinals beat the Eagles yesterday (Ok, there were a couple of Eagles fans in the group :-)).  Service was friendly but slow.  It didn't help that the waitress assignments changed for some of our group partway through the game.  The place was packed and everything was stretched to the limit.  Glassware became a problem and for a while beer came in room temperature glasses and mixed drinks were coming in whatever vessel could be found.  From what I saw and tasted of the food it was all OK except for the one salad I saw come out, some of it's components looked like what the rabbit had refused to eat.  I wouldn't drive across town to go there by myself but would if another gathering were to be called."}
{"text":"The parking lot was kind of dead, so I was a little freak walking in.  It is just your usual family neighborhood bar that you can even bring kids in.  They have tons of TVs and tons of space.  You can just walk in and choose your own table.  

We ordered the grilled Hot Raspberry Chipotle wings.  I was nervous to try the wings because of the chipotle (HOT, I am a WIMP).  But I watch the hubby eat one and he did not sweat or pass out.  So I drove in.  Wow, it was pretty good.  Not spicy at all.  I ordered the Chicken Cordon Blu Sandwich for dinner.  The sandwich is big and tons of fries on the side.  The sandwich was ok (enough chicken, ham, and cheese), but the combination of it did not make my mouth SING.  =(  So it is ok."}
{"text":"All u can eat fish n chips, cold beer, awesome customer service  and walking distance from Squaw Peak resort...
Can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and have never left disappointed. The food is always fresh and hot. My favorites are the burgers, wings and on weekends their breakfasts are excellent. I always order the pancake platter because the pancakes are larger than anyplace in the valley and they are delicious. The bartenders are fast and I have a waiter at my table minutes after I sit down if not sooner. Karaoke night on Saturdays are a blast as well. Every game is showing on the multiple TV's all through the building. Great place to go if you're a fan of an out-of-state NFL or college team. This is my favorite sports bar in the valley. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Boneless wings are delicious however does not make up for the crappy service. Waitress was unfriendly and too busy. Threw a printed piece of paper my way when I asked what was on tap and seemed preoccupied with her kids talking to her. Rarely checked back probably because my boyfriend and I are younger and she assumed wed be bad tippers because all the tables around us got plenty of attention. Here's the kicker michelob ultra is considered a premium here. I'm a bartender in the majority of the bars that I frequent and work for this is not the case. When I asked for a manager her attitude was snotty about it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"The first time I went to Gallagher's I went with my family after moving near by. The service was nice but the mozzarella sticks tasted like they were covered in cat food. The restaurant was pretty dead, which was nice because both the pool tables were open. Other than the food, the experience wasn't half bad. I've been back a couple of times (I stopped ordering food though) and the service got worse each time. Tonight was the last time I will ever go to Gallagher's. I went with a group of people including my brother (under 21). The waitress aggressively informed us that anyone under 21 had to leave at 10pm. We ordered food and started playing pool. The entire 30 minutes we were there we got constant dirty looks from the same waitress. She came around at 9:45 and again aggressively informed us of how much time we had until we had to leave. During this time I was trying to give her my card to pay. She walked away without taking my card. I stood at the bar until 10:01pm until she finally let me pay. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife cellibrating our anniversary on St Patrick's day and was very disappointed. They were not that busy. All drink were served in a plastic cup and fish and chips took 50 minute to come and and it was cold when it got there. The manager ordered us new meals but..... what a bummer and kind a spoiling the evening. Never again."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN! 
Stopped in for dinner after swimming all day at the Pointe Hilton and we were HUNGRY! The place was dark and pretty much empty. It was a Friday evening. We were told from a lady behind the bar to sit wherever we wanted. We found a seat and were given some dirty paper menus. Table was sticky too.  A few minutes later our waitress approached and took our drink order. 
Fridays are all you can eat fish. My hubby ordered the fish and my son and I ordered appetizers to start. We ordered mozzarella sticks, boneless wings, a 7\" pizza and chips and cheese dip. After giving our appetizer order the young lady asked the gentleman who seated us if the oven was working? He said as far as he knew the oven was working. He then came back and said the oven was NOT working. The waitress then told my son he could not order the pizza because the oven wasn't working. WAIT! WHAT?!  How is your oven NOT working???
So we ended up ordering burgers and fries along with the mozzarella sticks, wings and chips and cheese. Not even 10  mins later the waitress comes back with the appetizers saying that was fast huh? Ya a little too fast! The cheese dip was horrible! it was thick and cold. The tri-colored chips were nice and hot. The wings were alright and the mozzarella sticks looked and tasted like they were heated up in a microwave.

Next up was the main dishes. The baked fish was good. Came with fries and coleslaw. The burgers were huge but not that great. We didn't even finish the burgers cause they were just okay. My husband then asks for fried fish. She brings it out and it is way over cooked and dry. He didn't finish it. She gave us 32 oz drinks to go and we left. 
Within 30 mins of leaving there me and my son who had burgers, had HORRIBLE diarrhea and stomach aches!!!! This lasted a couple hours! NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT AT THIS PLACE!!! EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"I thought Gallagher's was a sports bar?  I had planned to meet a couple of friends and watch a rare ASU baseball broadcast on national TV.  I arrive first, and have to practically beg to have the game put on one of the many TVs present.  (I'm sure none of the other 3 people in the bar were watching Jeapardy).  Another patron (one of 3 already there) had asked previously, he told me later, only to be shot down by the manager.  So then I asked if I could actually listen to the game, too?  No such luck.  Did I mention this was the home-town ASU baseball team, nationally ranked, fighting for their post-season?  And a sports bar opts to play 80's hits, instead?  I quickly called BS on that, and as soon as the rest of my party arrived, we left.  If you want a \"sports bar\" near Squaw Peak, I suggest trying 16th St. Sports Bar n Grill, instead.

I've been to many Suns games and other events at Gallagher's, so I assumed they would have a local sports team on tv with audio.    The food is OK, the prices are a bit steep for pub-grub.  When I was there, a Monday during happy hour, there were about equal number of wait staff to patrons, and it still took 10 minutes to get a drink.

I'm very disappointed in the service, and the lack of understanding by the management.   The food isn't enough to get me back, and the prices are higher then average.  I'd give it less then one star, if I could."}
{"text":"If iI had known that the official title was \"Gallagher's Food and Fun\" I would have been in here a lot more often when I lived up the street. 

As it happened, I would come in from time to time to watch the Suns, especially during playoff time, when this place really gets jumpin. 

For all other intensive purposes, Gallagher's is a reasonably priced, solid sports bar. The food is good but not outstanding, and the staff is friendly but will show you the door in a hurry if you give them problems. 

If you're in the area and looking to munch on some wings and a beer or two, it's definitely worth a pass through."}
{"text":"i will only give it 2 stars b/c the dj for karoake was awesome and the food was good. on the negatives-some of the worst service i've ever had and i've been to a lot of bars/restaurants. the server repeatedly forgot my tables drinks. at one point i just went up to the bar to get a refill-it was so much quicker. my fiance went to get my one drink that was sitting at the bar for 10 minutes when she saw that she got it and gave it to me saying there was computer problems-hmm yea right. i had to ask for my check twice because i was waiting for 20 minutes for it. just terrible and i could on but i'll spare you. trust me i was a server for years so i understand getting slammed but it wasn't busy and she should've asked for help and not made up that there was computer problems. also i got a mixed drink and so did my friend and it didn't taste like any alcohol. despite all this my friends and i still had a really good time b/c of karoake. still don't think ill be back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"Gallaghers is a good neighborhood bar.  They have good drinks, passable food, Sports on TV, and a very friendly staff.  They also have free wifi.  I guess that means you can bet on the internet about the sports you are watching while you drink and watch with friends."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I have ever had!  My husband, son and I didn't eat more than one bite of our meals! The service was awful! HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!"}
{"text":"I live next door and come here often. They have a great happy hour featuring $3.75 20 ounce domestic beers and discounted apps. The boneless wings are my go to during happy hour and I love their honey hot sauce. I go for trivia on Thursday nights which they extend happy hour prices for domestic beers. The rest of the menu is all good, I've never been disappointed. I love their French dip and the burgers. I hear they're under new management and I've already noticed things improving. I'm going to keep coming here way too much as long as I live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Took 45 minutes to get our food, and my chicken cheese crisp was cold.  So were my friends' sloppy nachos and quesadilla. We ate it anyways, because we didn't want to send it back and wait another 45 minutes.  Three other people ordered the Cobb Salad off the Daily Special  .. the sizes and cost of the salads were all different.  ???   There are no prices listed on the Daily Specials...don't be fooled they are 5,  if you look closely, that is the time they start not $5.   I was hoping for more, as its very close to my home.  :("}
{"text":"Great drink specials, the server was awesome, quality atmosphere.  Not all that busy but that made it easier to converse with our friends.  Good place to meet up with friends and have a relaxing evening."}
{"text":"Spend most of our time at another Gallaghers but enjoy our Sat afternoons with Dawn much better. It's nice to have someone behind the bar who can talk beers.  Grilled wings were the bomb. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Eh, to be honest, as much fun as I had partying with my fellow Yelpers on Sunday, I can't give this place a sparkling review.  As much as I'd love to give a neighborhood sports bar props, this place just did too many things wrong for me to comply.

Went there with a bunch rowdy Yelpers to watch the NFC Championship game on Sunday and was fairly disappointed.  For starters, as a sports bar and Cardinals viewing destination that had been promoting themselves as \"the place to watch the big game,\" they seemed grossly unprepared for the crowd they got.

For starters, I sat at my table for about 15 minutes before I gave up on a server coming over to take my drink/food order, and went up to the bar to order and take the middleman out of the equation.  Only when I went up to the bar did I learn that they had run out of glasses!!!

This is where it gets good though.  Their drink specials that I was interested in were their $2.50 20 oz domestic drafts, pretty good deal if you ask me.  And since they had run out of glasses (definitely not my fault as I am not their barware supplier) and the bartender asked me to get a bottle instead, I naiively assumed they would honor at least a similar deal to the one that they were promoting.

This is where I was SORELY mistaken.  Not only did they not give me my 12 oz bottle for the same price as the 20 oz draft that they were unable to serve me, they actually had the nerve to upcharge me to $3 per bottle!!!

Needless to say, I was a bit incensed.  And it had nothing to do with the extra 50 cents per drink, I just thought it was poor business practice...a bit of a bait and switch, if you will.

After the initial poor service and swindling of my hard earned $$, the bar ended up being okay.  Of course I will have to attribute at least 75% of this to the wonderful company of my yelp compadres, who I hate to disappoint with my less than stellar review, but I have to keep it real.  The TVs were big and plentiful, the food was fair.  I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Wrap which wasn't bad but my fries were SUPER cold and therefore inedible to me.  But the bar's sorry excuse for a smoking section is what threw me over the edge and made me want to puke on more than one occasion.

We had the bad luck of being sat in the general vicinity of the door that led outside to the smoking section, and every time the door was opened either by a server or a patron, you could literally see plumes and plumes of smoke wafting into the restaurant.  It was disgusting.  I couldn't stay even 5 minutes longer after the Cards won to celebrate because I was coughing and my eyes were starting to water.

I am willing to give Gallaghers 1 more shot under the parameters that there can be no special event going on because they were terribly ill equipped to handle it, and mainly due to the fact that they had tons of TVs and it is relatively close to my house.

As long as the don't run out of glasses again of course..."}
{"text":"I will start this review off by stating that I am not one that goes to a lot of sports bars.  However, with football games to watch last Saturday, it seemed like a fun idea.  Highly enjoyed Gallagher's!  I had a fantastic beer on draft for $2.50.  Hard to beat that price!  Then I ordered the smoked meat platter with pulled pork (BBQ sauce).  It came with two sides and there were many great ones to choose from.  I decided on the sweet potato fries and the BBQ beans.  Really loved their BBQ sauce and would order the meat platter again.  The true highlight was their spicy BBQ beans.  They were so flavorful! The only person that makes beans comparable is my mom. My mom's are the BEST but Gallagher's comes in 2nd place.  Service was prompt and there are lots of TV's so it makes it very easy to watch a game and enjoy your meal.  If I lived in Phoenix, I would make Gallagher's my favorite sports bar."}
{"text":"Love this place for Karaoke.  Went with a group to sing this weekend and had an amazing time!  Food & Service are top notch."}

{"text":"What a joke this place is. The staff is arrogant and condescending , if you are not a regular good luck. They should be ashamed of the way they way they treat people. The best advice I can give is for a fun night out go anywhere but here! The food is horrible , the tap beer is beyond stale and the bartenders are angry at the world.... Avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"So, I have frequented this place enough to give honest feedback. The employees argue and fuss with each other, which I found to be quite annoying. The boneless \"wings\" are cheap on the weekdays, but their habanero and atomic sauce is weak because it lacks heat all together.

Their fish tacos aren't a gamble which is a pro. They do consistently have $5 Stone IPA on tap as well.

 An issue st this place are their speakers in the billiards area. They are so blown, I asked them to turn a few off because I was getting a headache from the horrid sounds deteriorated speakers create. They complied with my request and they had to reluctantly agree their speakers were of sub-par quality.

 Their Internet is so fast tho, that's their true saving grace besides the pool table. Now their oven is constantly breaking down and not properly operating, which makes zero sense to me. They try to have this \"diverse\" happy hour menu, but their oven consistently breaks down creating confusion amongst the staff and animosity within the repeat customer base. The owner(s) should invest in a new oven (my opinion). 

If you take the bad with the good, I'd give them 2 stars out of 5 when it's all said and done. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Damn you Yelp for your no half stars~!~!!!!!!! I guess I will have to write the review and then decide between 3 and 4 after I brain dump. 

I have been to Gallagher's twice now. The first time for Saturday night Karaoke, and the second for the final playoff game (Go Cards!). Over the span of those two visits, I have tried quite a few items. 

The nachos are really, really good. They use nacho sauce versus shredded cheese, which I happen to think is pretty tasty. However, the salad I ordered left quite a bit to be desired. I kept getting the crunchy gross part of the lettuce head so only half of my salad was edible. The cookie sundae was pretty damn good, as well. I have also had the cheese crisp which I have no complaints about. 

Perhaps the BEST thing about this place is the $3 well drinks. I am used to paying $5-$9 for a damn vodka tonic, so I was pleasantly surprised when I paid under $10 for three drinks! 

Now, service here is another story. I'm sorry to say that both times it has left something to be desired. I completely understand that the place was packed on a football day, but the whole place was reserved in advance so I feel like they should have been more prepared. I had to ask for limes three times, and waited twenty minutes to get one. It also took almost forty minutes to get my damn nachos when I first showed up. 

Another flaw? They put bacon/chicken on my salad, even though I specifically said no meat... and had previously told the waitress I was vegetarian (when I ordered nachos). 

Oooooo now that I think about it... the very worst part of my experience was that we were seated near the patio, so every time someone opened the door the cigarette smoke rushed in. My eyes were watering and I was coughing the whole time. It was pretty uncomfortable, actually. 

Overall Gallagher's is a pretty good sports bar with relatively good food and great priced drinks, but there are definitely some service issues. 

Damn.... I still can't choose between a 3 and 4 .... I know I will be back ... I'm going with 3 and if I'm impressed next time, I will update :)"}
{"text":"It's kind of divey but the buffalo wings are amazing, I recommend the good ol Irish experience"}
{"text":"Your basic neighborhood sports bar.  Been here a few times over the last few years and what can I say. The beer is cold, the food is basic bar food. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.

That's it."}
{"text":"I have been to this Gallagher's 3 times.  The food isn't the greatest, but isn't the worst.  I do have to say that the wait staff is very friendly.  It is a good place to go after work to have a few drinks and watch a game."}
{"text":"Very casual spot to grab a few drinks and some pretty decent bar food.  If you like to sit up at the bar and play those touch screen games, this is a good place to do it. Just be forewarned that they get a lot harder once you've had a few cocktails."}
{"text":"I read all of the reviews and while in Phoenix decided to go to this establishment. Was really excited by the menu.........the service was horrible.....food took forever! Will not return."}
{"text":"For an out-of-towner, was a fun place to be for Thursday night Football. Food was so-so but the friendliness and locals who hang there were great. Definitely a place to go for an Arizona Team game! Thanks Y'all for making me feel welcome even if I was only here for a few days."}
{"text":"Decided to head here to watch the Celtics/Bullets (aka. Wizards) game.  It was right next to my hotel and I could walk to it.  Walked into a dark bar/restaurant that was not very packed.  Sat up at the bar and ordered a Guinness.  Here is a breakdown of my visit --

Service - Top Notch bartenders that were friendly, talkative and willing to give some suggestions to local beers.  The waitress that kept stopping by the bar was nice and joined in the conversations.  She was hard working.

Drinks - The Guinness came out dark with a perfect head, but it seemed to be watered down and wasn't my usual dark milkshake.  I moved on to a local Phoenix beer that was better and finished with a PBR 16-oz can.  Perfect way to end the OT of a basketball game.

Food - Who can pass up Taco Tuesday of Shrimp in the middle of the desert?  They were $2.25 each and came out in a mound of cabbage with a green sauce and salsa.  The cabbage soaked up the flavors and helped mask the little shrimps that should have been grilled instead of boiled, but I was happy.  The reason the ranking dropped was that I found a huge black hair as I was finishing up the 2nd order.  Minor mistake for food :(

Overall Ranking - Loved this little local bar where everyone seemed to know each other.  Had a  couple conversations with those around me and got suggestions for place to visit while in Phoenix.  I would recommend checking this place out for some drinks if you want to enjoy a game on TV.  People were friendly, food was good (besides hair), drinks were ok (no Guinness), and there were games on each of the TV's."}
{"text":"Since I frequently visit Phoenix, it's a given that my dad will drag me, sorry take me here at least once during my stay. Since my dad is unofficially a \"regular\" here, our visits consist of honey bbq wings, fries, and beer- and the occasional mind eraser, long island, or jager bomb. All this being served by a \"negative nancy\", the title I give most of our unpleasant waitresses.

This last month I was a Gallagher's customer 5 times and unbeknownst to me, my dad now had a usual waitress, Kayla. Finally, someone who knows what their doing and has a good attitude. The wings were great, as they always are and i ventured out one night with a burger and had no complaints there either. If you're a sports fan or you gamble, this is the place for you. If you just happen to stumble in, ask for Kayla, she'll be the only one glowing amongst the negative nancys."}
{"text":"Being new to town, I've driven by this bar n grill many times. I've stopped by recently and thought the food, drinks, service, and prices were great. I can't give it 5 yet as I wasn't blown away but as I stop by more often I'll consider updating the review. Additionally, I haven't dropped by just to \"have a beer\" but will be sure to update with some feedback on that as well. I will say that their beer selection is quite good though. No complaints whatsoever!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I have never loved chicken wings as much as I do these at Gallagher's. Next time I travel to Phoenix this will definitely be a stop for me. The staff seemed really friendly and there were several locals there too. I got ready to leave and a monsoon storm came so I came back inside and decided to eat dinner. YUMMM!!!
I wish I could find somewhere in Northern California that made chicken wings as great as these were I just can't stop saying enough about how much I enjoyed the boneless chicken wings and you get to pick your own sauce."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  But we came here on a Friday and it was empty.  I think they do karaoke on Saturdays so maybe come then if you are expecting a crowd.  Otherwise enjoy having the place to yourself late on Fridays."}
{"text":"Amy, the Hostess rocks - greeted me with a smile the sec I entered, very polite & offered great beer & food suggestions. If you come here on any weekday - ask for the special -today its Tuesday thus, shrimp taco - they tasted great & fresh as if they came right out of the Sea of Cortez!"}
{"text":"So the fish fry was not my favorite. The fries were great and the coleslaw was pretty good. The fish seemed frozen and didn't have that classic beer batter that you expect with fish frys. the worst part of this meal was their terrible tarter sauce. When talking to waitress we were informed that they put sweet relish in the tarter sauce, this is such a odd combination and was so off putting."}
{"text":"Went here with a buddy to watch the NHL playoffs on a Saturday. We sat at the bar roughly around 6pm. We each had several drinks and planned on staying for food also when a family of around 12-15 people came in and they put together tables so they can all sit in the bar. Had no issue with that until one of the toddlers started crying non-stop. This went on for around 30 minutes and the parents did nothing to stop the child, they just sat there conversing with the rest of their party. This went on until actually the two couples next to us at the bar decided to leave because of the crying. Now mind you there is another side of this place that is a sit down restaurant with tv's, where the family should of been seated in the first place. After the two couples exited, my buddy and I decided to do the same. I asked him if he wanted to just head down to Zipps right down the road. He agreed and we asked for our check. Little did we know, but the bartender overheard our convo and gave us an attitude for leaving. We asked for the check, she came back and slammed it on the bar. I paid the bill, asking for change and she came back and did the same thing with the money. The funny thing is, our bill was around $60, so it's not like we just had a quick drink. Very rude! Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Thanks to Gallagher's I now have a gambling problem!  Perfect place to watch any game that might be on, bet on the ponies, or both!  Great happy hour specials and there is honestly no place better to be on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"Gallaghers is typical bar food therefore rating a 2.5 to 3 stars. I ordered a cheeseburger and fries. Burger was ok but my fries were way undercooked and anemic looking. The manager was very attentive however when I mentioned my fries, he said that they always make them that way. Well, I've eaten a lot of fries in my lifetime and these fries were definitely not good. My husbands fries were good though.....anyhow, he was very nice and offered to get me some \"well done fries\". I politely declined. Nice staff and was what we expected!"}
