{"text":"Much like Ed Ho's recent earth Bloor West endeavour, Globe bistro's focus is on local and simple; myself, I find that to be a beautiful combination, if it's pulled off right that is.

Cut off from the cozy front bar space, you can't help but notice how welcoming Globe's dining room is; distinguishingly set tables, character hardwood floors, and an interesting play on shadows and lighting all come together to create a soft and intimate space. It draws you in as soon as you enter, and it gives you the feeling that you're in for something special.

With considerate, friendly, detail orientated staff, the service at Globe doesn't disappoint. While it might have partly been because we were among the first tables they had in for dinner that night, we were warmly greeted by the entire front house as we were led to our table. No matter what business you're in, that type of attention scores big points.

Trouble is, I was there to eat, and most of the food at Globe fell a little flat...
There's a lot to be said about going local. With hype from the 100 Mile Challenege and a seemingly growing concern for eating local and sustainable, people are looking for food that's produced closer to home and with a smaller carbon footprint. While Globe's focus may be on local, it's hard to identify exactly how close 'local' is since they have items sourced from as far as Kelowna and Vancouver.

The West Coast Dungeness Crab starter was overcomplicated, which made it slightly hard to identify what the heck we were eating. Besides the obvious crab meat, which was subtly sweet and perfectly cooked, the plate also had a far-to-large savoury panna cotta and some haphazardly scattered popcorn. Yep. Popcorn. While the consistencies were actually pretty good, it was mostly a confusing dish to eat that came with no explanation.

The Second Winds Farm Elk main was a little too simple; too little color, not enough flavor, and effortless presentation. While the elk loin was perfectly cooked, the braised shoulder was tough and near-tasteless. The best part of the dish was the corn polenta.

Much the same with the pheasant, which also served the meat two ways. While the citrus breast was moist and tasty, the jerked leg was tough and lacking spices.
It's really too bad, because I truly wanted to love Globe. From the beautiful dining room to the amazing staff, I was sure I was in for something special.

Perhaps simpler is better, especially since what we're talking about here is a focus on local ingredients. Great cooking is all about balance, and if Globe could just work on simplifying some of their dishes (like the crab starter) and making others slightly more complicated (like the Elk main) and identify where they draw the line on being local, they'd have nothing stopping them."}
{"text":"Globe Bistro is my Summerlicious 2010 winner!

Spiced chutney & warm, crusty bread
I've come to appreciate a good spread that accompanies a nice bread basket. The spiced chutney was a pleasant start to the meal while my friend and I waited for the rest of our party to arrive. 

Tom Collins Cucumber Gazpacho
Lake Erie farms cucumber, lemon cress, preserved lemon, Canadian gin 
I enjoyed this version quite a bit. Never having tried a non-tomato gazpacho before, this was my first pick for lunch. I was very pleased with the light, refreshing flavour and great consistency. Unlike Biff's gazpacho, it was neither too creamy nor smooth. I prefer it with texture, and this one definitely rivals Boulevard Cafe's tomato-based gazpacho. I did not notice the gin, which is a good thing since I'm not a fan and I'd have to do a blind taste test to see if it made a difference. This was my favourite starter.

Smoked Black Cod Brandade
Crispy shallot rings, smoked paprika essence, confit garlic crostini
The crispy shallot rings were great with the paprika essence topped with a generous helping of the brandade. The texture was similar to very thick mashed potatoes, and the cod flavour was not too strong. This was the overall favourite appetizer of the table (but not mine!)

Shaved Fennel & Purple Basil Cress Salad
Spiced pistachio, taggiashi olive dust, orange gelée
I enjoyed this salad - the fennel had a good bite, the pistachios were great, and I enjoyed the orange gelée quite a bit. The gelée was sweet with a firm texture, which paired well with the vegetables.

Lake Erie Pickerel 
Wild rice coriander salad, Millbank green peas, marjoram cress, earth chardonnay vinaigrette
In spite of my typical hesitation to order fish, I have tried it at all of my Summerlicious outings this year. I was very glad that I did not miss out on this dish! The pickerel was cooked with the skin, which was nice and crispy and the wild rice salad was wonderful. The fish was seared very well, and was neither dry nor oily and was my favourite entree. I would order the fish at Globe Bistro again based on this!
 
Swiss Chard Torte Verde
Best Baa Farm feta, charred tomato coulis, blonde frisée, chives
The warm, baked feta on top of tomato coulis was quite savoury without an overpowering feta flavour. The tomato coulis had a cheesy taste and thick texture - I personally would have preferred a stronger charred tomato flavour instead but it was a great sauce to swirl the torte around before each bite.

Seared Cumbrae's Flank Steak
Duck fat Yukon chips, vine ripe tomato, scallion, Triple Crunch aioli
Carefully cooked, the steak was wonderfully pink and juicy. The aioli was a great accompaniment and steak's usual partner in crime - the fries - were quite tasty. Thickly cut and cooked in duck fat, they were enjoyed with each tender slice of steak. This was the overall favourite.

Callebaut Dark Chocolate Torte
Espresso mousse, Cherry Lane Farms black cherry sugar
Torte, torte, torte! Topped with mousse, this thick treat was a nice way to end the meal. I liked the torte at Biff's  a bit more, as it was a more moist and was served with a fruity sauce but this was a nice, satisfying variation as well. I love the density of torte, and the flavour of dark chocolate is something that I'll never tire of. I wasn't a huge fan of the espresso mousse - while good, I would prefer something a little sweeter/fruity/saucy for this dense dessert.

Globe Summer Berry \"Mess\"
Vanilla spiced meringue, bacon infused whiskey, Ontario berries
Yum! I'm not usually a fan of meringue or  vanilla but this dessert was light and pleasant. The meringue was airy and sweet, and a great combination with the Ontario strawberries. The stiff peaks were lightly browned and the vanilla flavour was very pleasant with the sweet berries. 

Ewenity Crème Fraiche Panna Cotta 
Candied lemon zest, wild blueberry soup
This is the first panna cotta that I've enjoyed at a Summerlicious meal. I usually find it too creamy in taste, however joined with the blueberry soup and candied lemon this was great. I particularly enjoyed the lemon zest! The blueberry soup was akin to syrup and I'll admit that I took some torte and gave it a good swirl - it was fantastic. 

Overall, I was very pleased with my experience at Globe Bistro - definitely a nice way to end this year's Summerlicious escapades. Great service, good food made with local ingredients, and wonderful decor - a surefire recipe for a nice lunch or dinner. A pleasant bistro to go with friends or clients and it has a rooftop patio!

{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went there on a quite Tuesday night to catch up on life after a long walk in Don Valley Park. 
One of the doors with nothing-special sign 'Globe Bistro' on Danforth opens up into a fancy dining area that expands massively before you. To  get to the roof top patio - the *gem* of the restaurant - you have to go three flights of stairs. Cozy little space with pillows on couches, superb specialty martinis, huge wine list and friendly service. The food selection is not big but is also exquisite. To say the least, you feel like you have found a secret get away in the middle of a greek town. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. My cappuccino was 1 part milk and 1 part weak espresso with almost no foam. The food was OK. Service was also OK. The decor was nice, but unfortunately, it's not a place I would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for their happy hour with my friend. Half price oysters and half price drinks. Their happy hour is daily till 6pm. We ordered a dozen of oysters each and an apple cider. 

Food: usually the oysters are $3/each but since it'a happy hour, it was $1.50/each. Great quality, super fresh, I would come back just for the oysters. Sucks they didn't have seafood sauce tho :( 

When we entered the place there were nobody there, we were the first table and a few other table started to come in after is. We were the first to order but our food came LAST. waited for 40 mins for our order, quite disappointing. We saw the servers carrying the oysters out but it wasn't for our table even tho we ordered first, we were served last. Other tables ordered other stuff from their normal menu where as my friend and I just ordered their happy hour oysters special so maybe that's why they treated other customers better than us which I find it really unfair. Also other tables got bread EXCEPT for our table. Even tho we only ordered from their happy hour menu but we are still paying for our food, we ain't getting it for free, we should get treated
The same way as other customers. 

Food was 4 stars but 1 star taken away because of their SLOW service and how they treated their customers unfairly hence the 3 stars rating."}
{"text":"Went to Globe for a business lunch today...

Overall, we felt that the meal was mediocre and overpriced.  We began with a eggplant soup that had a horrible acidity to it ($9, later taken off by our waitress, we left almost all of it).  a pasta dish had nice al dente pasta and fresh mushrooms, it was one of the highlights.

The frites were greasy but undercooked inside.  The ribeye was very flavorful, but the \"6 oz\" portion looked like much less than 4 oz, it was about 6 very civilized (small) bites.  Reportedly the fish and chips was good (our dining companion) but there was a very stingy portion of chips.

Overall, Meh!  Not worth the price for sure."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday brunch.  There was a group of approximately 12-15 of us.  My friend heard good things about this restaurant, so she booked the restaurant.

When we walked in, we were greeted immediately and seated.  The person serving coffee was really kind and came by every 15 minutes to top up coffee.

When we placed our order, we were surprised that the food was taking a really long time.  Our waiter had done a really poor job of serving our table because after we ordered our food, it took the restaurant over 1.5 hours to serve us.  They had screwed up our order and put us on the bottom of the list.  The last 2 people to join our table got their food and the rest of us waited and waited while other tables who had arrived half hour or more after us, got served their food. 

When I finally got my order of eggs benedict, the eggs were overcooked and the pork was overdone.  It would've been a much more pleasant experience had the waiter brought bread or something to help carry us over until the food arrived when we had asked, but he had completely forgotten about us.

The manager at least comped us for the trouble and bad service.  It's unfortunate because the waiter really should have pushed the kitchen to make our food ahead of the other tables who arrived and ordered an hour after us.  Incredibly disappointing, but glad the manager took the steps to rectify the situation."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks on the patio after work. The patio is small and cozy and although it wasn't covered, we didn't get any direct sun. The wine list was extensive, but otherwise the bar was understocked. I ordered a blonde ale that was on tap and I couldn't finish it. It was so bad, but they didn't charge me for it. Then I had the fish and chips which was mostly batter with a smattering of fish. Don't come here if you are hungry. The serving sizes are \"gourmet\". And since when is Elk a local food? Eastern Elk are extinct."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, excellent service, but average food.  There is an excellent prix fixe deal on Travelzoo for this place.  Corkage is $20."}
{"text":"This is such a nice upscale and trendy place. I went here for my birthday during Winterlicious and it was absolutely amazing. This is a great romantic spot for couples. The food tastes great, and they have interesting selections on the menu. I love how the menu changes depending on the local ingredients the chef's have access too. The portions of the food is smaller than what the average franchise restaurant serves, but this leaves adequate space for desserts. And we wouldn't want to be terribly full without trying their delectable desserts! I will definitely come back here"}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place a few years ago and for no real reason didn't go back for a while.. Until recently. And now we are addicted. The staff is super friendly, courteous and thoughtful. The food is great! We spent one evening going through all of the apps! Yum yum! Great wine selection! 

They have a tasting menu which we haven't had in years but it's on our list. A wonderful roof top patio that takes you completely away from the city! 

Amazing hour hour specials too!"}
{"text":"The Globe Bistro is one of my favorite restaurants in Toronto. It offers food with the exacting standards of a restaurant downtown, while offering a more informal environment suited to the neighborhood. Actually, The Globe features two environments: a casual gastropub in front, and a supper club in the rear. I've dined at this restaurant 10-15 times over the last few years. Time after time, the restaurant succeeds in offering delightful innovation, local ingredients, satisfying portions, and excellent service. This service is an unusual combination of amiable, knowledgeable, and unpretentious. Globe offerings span traditional brunch, full meals, and tasting menus. The tasting menus can be dazzling, and brunch is never less than satisfying. All this excellence comes at a price, of course, but there's value for the money. As an aside, the wine pairings add an extra dimension to dishes. And one should never ignore the salty caramels offered at the end of the meal. As always, I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I booked the Chef's Tasting menu (using our travelzoo coupon)
It had expired but the restaurant readily agreed to extend it for us.. Yeah! 
I can't say enough about our experience.  The server (Stacy) was a delight - friendly but not overly. Knowledgeable about the food and helped chose the perfect wines. The meal was top drawer! Everything from the Amuse Bouche to dessert was a taste sensation! One of those meals where you take a bite and just have to stop and savour.
Thank you Bistro!"}
{"text":"January 10, 2014 - Friday

It was my hubby's birthday and i never been to this restaurant, but read many really good reviews. During the online search of reviews, Travel Zoo had a promo of 6 course for 2 for $79; originally $149.

Personally, I don't like using vouchers, but I thought it wouldn't hurt to use it for Globe Bistro and in hopes the experience would be good. Turns out from the quality of the food to the service was utterly awesome! Love all the dish presentations. My hubby just fell in love with the place, still rants about the place and i love the selection of their wines; got a nice bottle of the Pinot Noir($71).

All in all, my bill came out to be $98(originally $210) for a 6 course dinner for 2 and a awesome bottle of wine and a bottle of sparkling water in an upscale restaurant. Obviously i tipped on the original price and everyone please do the same. 

**You never tip on the discount price cause, at the end of the day when they do tip out to the entire restaurant, they still tip out on from the original pice. This applies if the service and everything was to your liking**

I recommend Globe Bistro and would be back for the regular menu."}
{"text":"We had a class back to school gathering at this resto since it is owned by one of our classmates.

I arrived an hour late but just in time for ordering.  Our table ordered several apetizers (Albacore Tuna Takaki, Elk Tartare, Crispy Pork Terrine, Oysters, and the Heirloom Tomato/Cheese salad). We did not wait too long as they brought us bread with butter and another tasteful spread and an amuse bouche (lobster on a crispy deep fried chip). The amuse bouche is on the house and melts in your mouth.  The drinks also came promptly.

The Tuna Takaki tasted amazing...a piece of butterry sashimi that melts in your mouth. By the time the apetizer made rounds to me there wasn't much salad left other than red radish. Its served with pickled wild ginger, crispy shallots, scallion purée.  The Elk Tartare also melts in your mouth. Very flavourful raw beef like texture.  The Crispy Pork Terrine was light flaked shredded pork deep fried into a rectangle. This one was my least favorite apetizer - it was dry and not sure where the flavor lies.  The Tomatoe salad had very fresh cheese and was very tasty.  The oysters were good but did not come with the normal seasoning sauces on the side. Rather the sauces were served on 3 spoons in the middle of the dish which made it awkward.

For the main course I ordered the duck breast. It was cooked in a breaded exterior.  The meat was tender and had good flavor. Portion was small.  It was served with some baby radish (3 small pieces the size of a dime) and a orange reduction sauce.  On the other side of the plate was this deep fried crispy ball made with shredded duck. This crispy ball was tasty since the outside was deep fried. It had good flavor. 

The ambiance of the resto is quite nice. We sat indoors but they do have a patio.  

My meal came to $34 including tax, tip, and a juice. I did not have an apetizer or dessert.  They automatically added gratuity of 15%.  They put an apetizer onto other people's bills since we did separate billing. If you want separate billing, they prefer you tell them from the beginning especially for a larger group.

Overall it was a good experience. I was hungry shortly after. Its more of a tasting fine dining type of menu rather than a hearty homestyle cooking judging by the portions/pricing. As we were all catching up a month and a half after we had all seen each other last, the conversation rotated around what we missed the most and what we missed the least about school. Our focus was on catching up more so than on the food. 

Their motto is think globally, eat locally. So they source their ingredients from local producers.  Overall, it was a good experience with a unique variety of items to try on the menu.  I would recommend it for those that enjoy high quality ingredients over portion size."}
{"text":"Picked this restaurant due to good reviews on yelp and appealing summerlicious menu. The decor is very elegant at the back but a bit dark as it took a while for my eyes to adjust to the lighting so that I could read the menu. The place is a lot bigger than I thought with multi floors. There are only two washrooms on the mainfloor and the staff was kind enough to inform me of more washrooms upstairs after waiting for a while on the main floor. We ordered summer salad, pickerel rilletes and pig tails croquette as starters, flank steak, Lake Erie perch and wild boar sausage as main and lemon tart and brownie as dessert. The summer salad I ordered was as fresh as just coming out of a backyard garden and the dressing was not overtaking the freshness of vegetables. My steak was a bit tough but others who ordered didn't have the same issue. The lemon tart was yummy but the plate is a bit oversized for it but it is probably part of art where the tart is placed on one corner of the plate. Overall, I felt that they maintained the same high quality for summerlicious and the servers were friendly and polite even we didn't order any wine and drinks. Will be on my 'return' list of restaurant to try out more good stuff!"}
{"text":"Went here with my hubby on a date night, and we decided to try a new place. Should have kept going. The Maitre d' was nice and welcoming, and the restaurant is nice and comfortable. I found the menus, which were printed on coloured construction paper, flimsy and very hard to understand. As I am vegetarian, my options were limited. I went with a smoked tuna dish. Although the food was good, the portion size was laughable (I actually did laugh), and the cucumber \"salad\" tasted like it had been sitting in vinegar for way too long. And tell me: what self-respecting restaurant serves POPCORN as part of their meal?? The staff seemed friendliest when we were leaving.

Hubby and I ended up going to Cafe Demetre's afterwards, because I was still really hungry.

Won't be going back to Globe Bistro anytime soon, if at all."}
{"text":"I love this place, have dined here for dinner in the past but recently attended a baptism party here and had a chance to enjoy the food in a private event setting.  The space itself is beautiful, with it's modern but sophisticated decor.  Whoever chose the art work has great taste, looks like custom size pieces.  We had a private brunch and all levels of the restaurant were occupied by our party.  The food selection was simple, and not over assorted, well edited in fact.  They even gave us the private party room upstairs to use as a kids play area which I thought was pretty darn smart and courteous, it kept the kiddos from running around the place and made us feel more at home there.  Service was professional and would make me consider hosting my own private event there seeing how friendly the staff is and well executed the party was.  This could very well be my favourite restaurant on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I hated this place, and not just because of the terrible service and subpar food. The upscale fanciness that greets you on the way in is so misleading!

The classy interior, with its crystal chandeliers, stonebrick walls, separate bar, sleek furniture, and slogan of 'think globally, eat local' makes you think you're going to be in a super special dining experience. This feeling was consolidated by a greeting from not one, but two hosts, one of whom took our coats and bags and placed them on a rack. Even by the Danforth's high standards, it looked like the Globe Bistro was going the extra mile with its ambience. And all this was just for a casual Sunday brunch! We were incredibly impressed!

It all went rapidly downhill once we were seated. Our server was friendly and polite, but slow and inept. Forgot to bring us water and had to come back and clarify our orders after we placed them. We then waited some 35 minutes after ordering for two simple eggs benedict - one with peameal, one with pork belly - to arrive at our table. During this time, there was no apology or explanation from the server.

The food arrived and my heart sank. There was about six home fries accompanying the sorry and stale looking eggs and bacon. The home fries came heaped in salt, probably to try and disguise the fact that they were hard and stale, and most likely previously frozen. The muffin the eggs benny came on was squidshy and tasteless. The peameal itself was gross. The quality of the bacon was terrible, it tasted incredibly fatty and chewy and every bite was a chore. I haven't had enough eggs benedict in my time to critique the hollondaise sauce itself, but it certainly didn't taste like anything special. Eggs themselves were ok, but not the freshest.

The espresso in my americano was burnt, and the pork belly my bf had tasted as though it had been reheated. He wasn't a fan of the home fries either.

Totally not worth the long wait for the food, and very frustrating to encounter such poor service and food in a place that appears so classy and upmarket. The table beside us were also complaining about their long wait and the shoddy service they encountered.

And of course - like in so many other places that have slow and lazy service regarding the actual delivery of food - once we asked for the bill, it came INSTANTLY.  When it came to getting paid and getting a tip, the service was lightning fast and all smiles. But feel free to keep us waiting almost 40 minutes for two simple brunch entrees without even an acknowledgement of the inconvenience!! Grr!

There are far, far too many great brunch places on the Danforth, and on neighbouring Queen, to justify this place getting any more than one star from me. I can safely say without any irony that the food and service would have been much better if we had just breakfasted at the close-by McDonalds or Timmie's instead.

Maybe it's better for dinner, but I won't be returning to find out. Walk five minutes east to Cafe Fiorentina's to get world-class food for cheaper."}
{"text":"This past Thursday I had dinner with my wife at Globe. This is my third visit to this restaurant and like usual, I very much enjoyed the creativity of the chef.  The food was very \"earthy\" and natural.  We did the y course tasting menu, of which I enjoyed the ahi tuna and braised duck roll the most.  I am definitely craving more protein in the menu but the food is well thought out and can appeal to a variety of people.  The service as usual was too notch.  The staff was friendly and not intrusive  while enjoyed a quiet evening with my wife..  one little thing I learned on this visit, they have a good top patio : )"}
{"text":"Had our annual Holiday party here and the food was outstanding. The staff couldn't be any friendlier. They are really good at accommodating large party. My favourite is the elk dish...its cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"I went here with 3 friends on a Tuesday night for some food and a drink before a gig. We were seated on the rooftop patio which was nice, comfortable seating, relaxed atmosphere and pleasant staff.
I was torn between having the burger or the duck. The people at the table next to us had ordered the burger and it was very big, served with fries, so I decided to try something different and ordered the duck. At $29 I was expecting something exceptional, sadly it didn't deliver. The duck was very tasty, the rest of the meal on the plate was hidden under the duck and no exageration there wasn't even enough of it to have one forkful with each slice of duck, the rice ran out halfway through despite my best attempts at rationing so I ended up eating duck without anything else to accommpany. Absolute disgrace for the price charged.
1 of my friends ordered 2 starters a green salad which was ok size wise and chorizo which was very small, two bite size pieces only.
Another ordered the scallops which was a main course and the oysters as a starter. The verdict was very tasty, but again tiny portions. The scallops came as three individual scallops with 3 slices of orange, nothing else for $15!
The 3rd person ordered the scallops and the fish croquette which was bite size.
We ended up going for falafels afterwards as we were still hungry and all regretting not ordering the burger!"}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious dinner ($35) on a Sunday evening.  It was not busy at all and my party of 5 was seated immediately.

Starter: Peaches and Cream Corn Chower (2/5)
This soup was just ok.  

Main: Wellington Country Smoked Pork Lion (1/5)
The portion was quite large, the pork lion itself was a bit dry.  Not sure if smoked pork loin is inherently dry, but I wasn't really impressed.

Dessert: Ice Cream sandwich (3/5), Eton mess (5/5)
The ice cream sandwich was ok.  Could not tell the difference between sheep's milk though.  The Eton Mess, on the other hand, was amazing.  Think a large berry bowl (with berry sauce), chunks of meringue and cream.  I would consider coming to this place to have the Eton Mess as a dessert.

Service was ok, they start you off with complimentary bread along with an interesting spread (I cannot remember exactly, it was apple/caramel/cinimon or something along those lines) and butter."}
{"text":"Have been here a number of times and have had fantastic and memorable meals. Consistently high quality and masterfully done courses with excellent service. I brought my vegan friend with a severe nut allergy here, knowing that the chef would be able to come up with something delicious and they did not disappoint. She still says it is one of the best meals she ever had. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Globe Bistro is a beautiful restaurant located in a former entertainment complex/bowling alley from the 1920s. The dining area in the back retains the alley flooring, (keep an eye out for markings). They specialize in locally produced, and globally influenced dining. 

The sister restaurant to Earth in Rosedale, http://www.yelp.ca/biz/earth-toronto-2, Globe is consistent, and that is what counts. I have been for Summerlicious, Winterlicious, Business lunches and dinners and every time the quality and service has been as good as the last. I have certainly ordered things that were not to my taste, but it is clear that everything is prepared with care. 

This is definitely a more formal/more expensive restaurant, more suitable for business or special occasions. It is not pretentious by any means, and last night I wore full winter boots under the table and did not feel out of place. Menu changes frequently utilizing local and seasonal ingredients.   

The service is fantastic. Friendly, not overbearing, professional, courteous. The attention to detail is superb. On last visit (last night) one of my companions arose to go to the washroom and left his napkin bunched on the table. Our server swept in and silently folded it with one hand and had it neatly ready for his return. Water is always filled, everything comes right at the perfect time, the entire experience is very orchestrated,  all signs of a restaurant with impeccable service principles. these are not the kind of servers standing around txting or even chatting with each other.

Food very fresh and tasty. Great atmosphere. Washrooms are always spotless.   

if you are historically inclined, you can read a breakdown of the properties  history here from their website (including a lot of information about Danforth in general)  http://www.globebistro.com/Portals/84/CustomPages/History%20of%20124%20Danforth%20Avenue.pdf

Globe is a safe bet for quality food, good service and a nice time."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Waited for close to ine hour for what should have been the quickest food to prepare. At one.point when the waitress.clearly saw that we were getting agitated when others who came on after us were being served, she actually said that our food was being plated and would be right out-we waited 25 minutes after that for our meal. No apology, no comp. Never going back and will continue to diss them at every opportunity."}
{"text":"Including last week's dinner, I've now been to this place 5 or 6 times and have found the food, service, and experience to be excellent every time.  Also impressive is that I've been on different days of the week, including weekends, and have never noticed a difference in the quality of food, service, or attention to detail, which says a lot about a place, imo.  

The space has a very light and airy feel to it, with very high ceilings, muted lighting, and an upper level of seating lined by a glass railing.    Definitely not a spot for large groups of friends, more suitable for say a table of four or romantic dinner.  I understand they now have a rooftop patio but I've never been so I can't comment on it.

The menu is relatively short, with five to six entree and a similar number of mains, along with by-the-glass wine pairing suggestions.  The wine list itself is pretty comprehensive, with a very good selection of some gems from Niagara and PE County, as well as interesting options from around the world.  At last week's dinner, we chose to abandon all pretence of pairing, choosing a full-bodied Aussie red that didn't go with any of our dishes but was nonetheless really satisyfing.

As for food, we both enjoyed lobster three ways--in a salad, raw, and in a light tempura batter--and it was difficult to figure out which was tastiest.  Along with a glass of white Burgundy (okay, I had to pair the lobster properly) this was a real treat.  I opted for the coq au vin, which was a much lighter treatment of what is usually a fairly heavy, rustic winter dish, the almost duck-like (crispy, yet melt in your mouth like) chicken accompanied by sweet sauteed grape tomatoes and some cloud-like mashed potatoes.  My wife had the forementioned lobster as a main and a very rich yet delicate asparagus soup with chevre as a starter.

Didn't have time to stick around for dessert but have enjoyed these on previous occassions.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty standard up-scale spot. I don't know if it was worth the moolah, but the food was pretty good. There was a fly in my negroni so they made me a second one, which was nice of them. Staff were all pretty attentive and good-looking.

Had these great little snacks the chef sent out to the tables to get us excited for the meal (there's a name for those things right?) which was basically deep fried boar. It was so delicious I asked for a second order of them...I got a funny look but they came out anyway. Perfect. 

Atmosphere is probably the best part about Globe - dim lighting, white table cloths, modern finishes...great place to take a date in that regard (or maybe Robert K. because you both have nothing to do except be creepy weirdos).

As for the mains...there is nothing to complain about but nothing I can remember from a few weeks ago...so can't have been that great, right? What a useless review this was. Sorry for making you read all that."}
{"text":"Came here during summerlicious with 8 people so, to be fair - that may have impacted the quality of my experience. 
The decor is stunning. 
When we came we wished there was more reviews on the summerlicious menu so I hope this May help somebody else there trying to decide what to order! 
Apps 
Smoked fish- was small portion but tastes really good. It's nice and light.  Everybody at our table voted this their fave of the apps! It looks beautiful too! 

Pigs ear- I personally didn't like it. Found it tastes like squishy salt, though my bf liked it. (He insists that you have to eat each bite with a little of everything on the plate- sauces etc) id recommend getting this if you have a veryyyy open mind and are purely curious about what it'd be like to eat a pig tail and ear. But if your hungry, haven't had a pigs tail before, and really want something delicious- skip this one. 

Strawberry gazpacho- I really enjoyed this. It was like nothing I've ever had before. It was a fair portion size and was an awesome way to start my meal.  

Mains- 
The menu allows you to order a main off te regular menu and then had summerlicious prices for an app and dessert. That was pretty cool.  We were hoping that the higher price off the regular menu would mean more food- not the case. Just know that the portions of all mains are small.  


Dessert- the brownie was so delicious!!!!!!! It had a slight coffee taste- but everybody at the table agreed it was the best one. 
I can't say enough good things about it. We were also told that all icecream is made in house which is awesome because it tasted so delicious. 

The peach Melba was another huge hit. It's incredibly fruity and delicious sherbet type icecream. Two scoops- very yummy! 

The cherry tart had a good flavour but tasted like it was a little stale.  Still- it was delicious. Dessert was our fave part! 

Te service was SOOOOO slow! There was a solid 45 min at least between each course- which was fine by us because we were a huge group so we entertained ourselves. 
We were also slightly taken back by the price- we each had a summerlicious meal and we had twobottles of wine for the table and it came to 710... Strange but we didn't think about it until after we left and realiZed that didn't make sense .. 

Cool place to try- but you'll leave hungry!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast, bit gloomy n cold day outside, globe bistro was even gloomier inside, v dark for the morning.... felt like We made a wrong brunch place choice. 
The skillet i ordered was bit bland with no bread provided. Quantity was tiny compared to prices. It was really Boring experience, thats all. We r big foodies n enjoy the experience of dining out, never knew food cud get boring like this. 
Mimosa n Champagne Cocktail for breakfast was ehh! Server was sweet, there were jst 3 tables full at 12-2pm. Nothing stood out."}
{"text":"Our lunch from the summerlicious menu was not that great.  Maybe we should have gotten other items on the menu as we heard good things about this place before.  

Location is great, it's just a few steps from Boardview station.  We love the look of this restaurant with sleek and modern deco.  There are three floors in the restaurant with four different dining areas:
First floor - bar & front, formal dining room in the back
Second floor - looked like a private party area
Third floor - rooftop patio (this is where we sat) with bar

Pork Chorizo:  This was seasoned really well and the sides complemented the Chorizo nicely, but nothing special.

moked Char Croquette:I would  have to say this croquette was a great start to my meal and also was the best thing I had here.  If I had one complaint, it would be that I found the Russian salad on the side to be way too salty for my liking.

Smoked Canadian Sturgeon: served with Saffron rice, charred scallions and romesco sauce. The fish was overcooked as it was tough and dry.  One side of the fish was too salty, again.  However, the saffron rice and the romesco sauce was pretty tasty. 

Charred Flank Steak:  This was served with warm bacon, potato & dandelion salad and smoked tomato puree.  I really enjoyed the bacon, potato and dandelion salad - it felt like I was eating spinach. MMM!  I wasn't a big fan of the flank steak, it was too overcooked and tasteless.

Lavender White Chocolate Pudding : The pudding was yummy, although the presentation was disappointing.  If you like pudding and creamy desserts, go for this!

Chocolate gelato slider was served between two chocolate chip cookies and toasted hazelnuts.  Again, the presentation could have been better if not for the hot weather... the gelato was half way melted by the time it came to me."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem amongst a lot of boring offerings on The Danforth. The food is always delicious and beautifully presented. The level of detail and effort (and number of locally sourced ingredients!) in every dish is very impressive.

I have eaten here four times, twice for their six course tasting menu with wine pairings. I highly recommend it. Each dish was unique and interesting, and very tasty. The wine pairings highlighted the best of Ontario wines. Also the dining room is beautiful and the service is attentive to detail. For example, there was a bit of a misstep with one of our dishes where the meat was a bit fatty, and we left some on our plates. The waitress noticed and for our next course upgraded the cheese plate to a nicer level of cheeses, even though we didn't even mention any problem. 

Try out this local gem, it deserves more recognition!"}
{"text":"Best Burger in Toronto!
We have been to Globe several times for dinner and have always had a great experience. We have been working our way through the menu and are always impressed with the food. On our last visit this past Tuesday I had the burger - WOW! I thought it would be good but not that good... definitely best burger in the city. Can't go wrong with Globe - something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"I went here for a quick bite to eat and honestly.. it was extremely pretentious. The food was waaaay overpriced and it wasn't really that great. I got a $14 salad that consisted of three tiny beets, two slices of cheese, and some weird red goo. I felt like a total sucker for deciding to eat there. Great concept.. bringing local foods to the dishes. But there are plenty of restaurants that are doing this without overcharging so much."}
{"text":"**We also went to Globe for Winterlicious but our experience was no where as nice as previous reviewer.

**The scallop appetizer did not consist of three scallops, it was one large scallop cut into three on a cold plate with a mere scattering (and that's being generous) of some rendition of pork belly the size of an eraser top.  Over cooked and cooked like yesterday.

**The next course was Duck breast over risotto.  The duck was just ok (cold again) about 2 oz over about a 1/2 cup of risotto that litterally tasted like it came from one of those packages.  Non-existing sauce of any kind.  Boring is what it was.  Yearning for one of those ducks in the window in Chinatown at this moment.....

**3rd course was Apple tart, it was ok if you were say at a donut shop. could make  better  at home.  About the size of 2 loonies. 

**Beer and wine fine (one star for that).  Service was ok (one star for that).  Waiter presented bill even though we didn't ask for it.  I guess the 100 or so patrons (or suckers) waiting at the door didn't help the cause.

**I know that winterlicious is a tasting menu and portions are smaller then norm but this was ridiculous and if Globe wants returning business this menu was not it.

7 people, 7-$35 winterlicious, 2 bottles red, 6 beers, 2 cognacs, 4 coffee + tip.....$600   not worth it..."}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed - had been planning to go for a while since we moved into the area and had heard good thing. Food was mediocre and the service while unfailingly polite very absent even though there was barely anyone else there. Frustrating as we had looked forward to going..."}
{"text":"Went here on a groupon night with 2 other couples. Service was so-so. 2 couples on groupon had the tasting menu, and the 3 rd couple ordered a la carte. I wouldn't recommend the tasting menu, found the selections to be a bit bland and some of the portions very small.  The couple who ordered a la carte seemed much happier with their meal.  I was disappointed in this spot as I'd heard that it was special, but given this performance I won't be going back. Not horrible, just not worth the trip from the west end."}
{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch - $29/person - 3 courses plus coffee & scones. Great offerings like smoked Arctic char and lamb with couscous. Despite the fact that the place was jam-packed, our waiter was incredibly attentive and very gracious - an incident with an oversalted quiche was dealt with so quickly and professionally that I was astounded. Great customer service and a very positive experience."}
{"text":"Note - review is based on Winterlicious 2017 experience ($23 lunch).

Location/Service
Located in the heart of Greektown on Danforth.  Pretty busy area - with street parking and Green P's around the block.  Make sure you watch your time..cause it's parking :D

I was surprised how big the restaurant is. From the main entrance, it looked small and narrow.  It gets pretty wide as you walk in and there's 3 floors to accommodate!  We had a party of 10, so we sat in a single table on the second floor.

Service was nice as the staff tries to be as attentive with the orders, explaining the food, water/drinks, but running up and down can be a little slow.


Food
Appetizer - Smoked Haddock Churros.  The churro was not overly oily or fried - and it comes is all different shape/sizes (mine was apparently the biggest).  There was saffron aioli (Spanish sauce) that compliments well and doesn't leave it too try.  And there's arugula to add some healthiness into it!

Main - Wellington County Striploin.  Cooked medium rare, very well executed. Loved the glaze and how it tender/juicy it was.  The size may look small, but it was very thick - so it does fill up.  Mashed potato is also nice (perfect side dish to beef).

Dessert - Blueberry Baked Alaska.  This is a sorbet and meringue mixed together.  An interesting pairing, but not to my personal preference.  It melts a little quick, so it does get a little ugly/messy as you eat it.  The almond milk cream as a heavy taste to it.


Overall I really enjoyed Globe Bistro - especially when we had such a huge party.  We sat there for almost 3 hours for lunch, but it didn't feel like we were bothering others since we were a little secluded on the second floor.  I would love to come back and try their regular items and see what there's to offer :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is not up to speed with price - value. Super small serving sizes, and the notation wine list is over priced and super limited. The only redeeming feature is the rooftop patio weather permitting."}
{"text":"I used a Travelzoo voucher for the 6 course tasting menu. The food was phenomenal! Not to mention the staff and chef go above and beyond, to ensure that you have a great experience. I was surprised to hear our waitress ask if we have any dietary dislikes, so that the chef could accommodate for any restrictions AND dislikes. Overall, I had a great time and wonderful experience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant with a good concept, a good wait staff, but mediocre food. I forgot the precise name of what I ordered but it was along the lines of steak, eggs, bread, and mushroom fricasse (it was on the brunch menu). For the price I was paying, I expected more for presentation on the test. However my steak and eggs were very under seasoned, and the dish was only salvaged by the deliciously prepared mushrooms. I would've given this restaurant only 2 stars had it not been the great service, and the neat concept of serving local foods. I will probably not be returning simply because it is too expensive for that quality of food."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is so tasty, with an emphasis on local and seasonal and the service is excellent.  Daily soup of parsnip puree with white chocolate was delicious as was the ricotta laspavegna. And finally a place where you can have a nice meal AND converse with other people at your table without having to raise your voice. I'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"This was the first place we went out to in Toronto and I loved it. We were here for brunch and there is something about this place that invites you in and promises you a great time - even in the middle if winter. Although the place got super busy, the staff was attentive and cheery. (Nothing like a droopy wait staff to kill the joy of brunch). I had Globe's benedict with some smoothie (it was a special) and I loved it. It was a perfect brunch - relaxing with a kick from a caffeine high:)"}
{"text":"Winter-freaking-licious! One of the best food festivals around has brought me to Globe. My Aunt and I searched the menus and based our decision on one item on their menu, a Dutch dessert called Speculaas. Yes, the reviews were good, but no one else offered Speculaas.  

Upon arrival, they took our coats and seated us. They offer seating on 2 levels and in a private room. This place was beautifully designed and earth friendly. The bathroom even had real hand towels! Not to mention, the kitchen is centrally located which made the entire place smell fantastic. 

Our server, Stacy, was fantastic. My dad can be a bit of a handfull in an out-of-work-stand-up-comedian kind of way. He made friends with the table beside us as well. Poor couple! They were a good sport about it(Thank God!). Stacy was fun and attentive. Our glasses were kept full and our plates cleared. It's always nice to have a server that is fun yet professional. Stacy was awesome. 

We got a chance to meet the Chef and ask him why he made the Speculaas. He's Dutch, like us, and wanted to give some Dutch flavour to the menu. He knew we'd be tough critics about it, so he said he'd come by after dessert for the verdict. 

First course was the Smoked Haddock Croquette, another Dutch treat! It was crisp and fresh and the mustard aioli cut through the intense smoky flavour. It was lovely. My Aunt chose the Duck Liver Parfait. She said the liver had the perfect texture. The elderberry preserves and brioche made it divine. In addition to the Winterlicious apps, we also tried the Steak Tartare. This was a first for me. It was seasoned well. I expected the texture to be unpleasant, but it was actually an enjoyable dish. Pleasant surprise! 

Next was the main course. I had the Rosemary & Garlic Braised Ontario Lamb Shoulder. I love food I don't have to chew. The lamp was so tender, it fell off the bone. I literally pulled it apart with my fork and let it melt in my mouth. Fantastic! My dad chose the Roasted Perth County Pork Loin and my Aunt went with the Mushroom Tagliatelle. By the time, I had enjoyed some of the lamb and veggies, my father's plate was clean. The pork loin had been slow roasted and the chick pea masala was a nice touch. My Aunt loves pasta and this was no exception. A good helping of fresh pasta piled with local mushrooms and topped with parsley and celeriac puree. What a meal! 

Dessert time. *cracks knuckles* It's time to get down to business. The Speculaas had arrived. We could smell the cinnamon scents of the dessert we know and love. Well, this definitely passed the test. If you've never had it before, it's a dessert square with flavours of gingerbread and cinnamon. He nailed it. We reminisced about my Oma and compared it to hers. Great job! 

he Chef returned to see what we thought. Two thumbs up! It was just like Oma used to make and we were so pleased with his recipe. He said he'd been working on it and we were glad he did.  

I'm a chocolate person. So, we also tried the Dark Chocolate Custard. Rich, rich, rich! The mixture of the custard with the hazelnut merengue and whipped cream was absolutely to die for.  

What a great experience. Right from start to finish, it was a memorable night. I'd absolutely come back. Knowing it's farm-to-table makes it even better."}
{"text":"Think global--eat local. More than a slogan, this is the culinary philosophy of Ed Ho. His Toronto restaurant, Globe Bistro, was at the forefront of the local movement long before it was en vogue to go local, and he is still pushing the boundaries for locavores to follow.

Warm and rustic, the re-design of Globe Bistro is reminiscent of Ho's other restaurant entity, Earth. The menu invites us to discover the breadth of Canadiana. Comfy black leather banquets beckon us to stay a while.

With pride in local Ontario produce Chef Dan Sanders shows us he has the globe at his fingertips. His artful pairings like seared BC albacore tuna and crispy pork belly with squash kimchi and apple emulsion; black cod and lobster with pea puree, cinnamon cap mushrooms and wild rice crackers; and roasted elk loin and braised osso bucco with spaghetti squash and mushroom ragout reflect his flare for decadent tastes of culinary matrimony. Punctuating the menu is Canada's Finest Plate, a daily feature that showcases the fresh local ingredients from today. (Full disclosure: I had called the restaurant mid-afternoon to ask about the feature, and was told the Chef could not reveal it until after 5pm. I would not be surprised if he was out foraging). We want to be impressed by a Chef's adroitness and imagination, and we are. Each plate is a vibrant medley of colours, textures and flavours.

Just as the dining menu has a strong regional focus, so too does the wine menu. Globe Bistro has been a Winner of the Wine Spectator Award of Excellence every year from 2009 to 2014. We are delighted to find one of the most in-depth selections of Ontario
VQA wines available in Toronto.

For a tease, we also glance at the weekend brunch menu, but then promptly return for brunch to delight in a swine & dine of eggs, potato hash and pork seven ways (house sausage, bacon rasher, pork belly, peameal, creton, pork & beans and crackling)! Also of tantalizing note is French toast of spiced carrot bread stuffed with citrus cream cheese and a sprinkling of toasted walnuts and maple syrup.

Originally built as a theatre in 1910, Globe Bistro offers us a variety of ambience. From the front bar to the main dining room, and from seating at what was once a stage to the second floor private dining. The rooftop patio is a hot destination for urban getaways, as we find an eclectic vibe of the after-work crowd rolling into the evening.

Flaunting a playful side, the kitchen sets my sweet tooth singing with imaginative confections including a wholesome scoop of croissant ice cream. Exploring the locale of local, we've got the Globe on our map!"}
{"text":"I have only been here once before but decided to check out the rooftop patio, for a friend's birthday.

Upon entering, the hostess(es) were very pleasant and I was hoping this experience would carry through the evening. Wrong.

Initially our server was quite pleasant but after our first round of drinks she was no where to be found.  Felt like she was hiding behind the pillar and I had to play hide and seek to locate her.

My friends ordered the steak ($38) , the gnocchi ($21) and I ordered the crab and lobster ($36).  The general consensus was that the food was nothing more than average.  No one was blown away. My meal however, was just not good.  I like salt but even for me it was WAY too salty.  In fact, that's all I could taste in the sauce. Salt.  Given the price point, as well, the portions are very small.  

After we had completed our mains our server (finally) showed up and asked if we wanted dessert.  My friend ordered Spanish coffee and I asked for a cheese plate (which was the best part of the meal).  I don't know what set her off but the server's attitude from that point on was ridiculous.  She was so snitty, bordering on rude.  

Based on my experience of average food and rude service I do not recommend and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Truly a special place. We went for the chef's tasting menu and it did not disappoint. Each course was imaginative and delicious. Cream of cauliflower soup, golden beet and goats cheese salad, trout, duck breast, a goats cheese cheddar, and dessert. The service was excellent not even the slightest point to critique. And the happy hour buck-a-shuck oysters and half price wine was a lovely pre-dinner bonus. Both of us were very pleased and we plan on returning.

I whole heartily recommend. Great night out."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our Summerlicious dinner at Globe Bistro.

Conveniently located only steps away from the Broadview station, we were seated promptly. We arrived at 9:30pm and asked for rooftop patio seats; however, it was full.  

From the $35 menu, I enjoyed the albacore tuna crudo, which was light and refreshing.
The elk sausage was moist and flavourful.  

For the main dishes, the fried chicken thighs were a hit but popcorn grits were a bit dry. The steelhead trout was cooked perfectly and pea emulsion was incredible. 

To end the evening, the strawberry shortcake and chocolate ice cream cake were both enjoyable - however, some may say the strawberry shortcake was a bit dry.

Overall, the portions at Globe are large and generous! We were stuffed.

If you're looking for a refreshing wine, they have a great Rose. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was initially interested in Globe Bistro because of the locally sourced ingredients, and had read some positive reviews, but I am seriously regretting wasting a Saturday night and birthday dinner there now. We went as a party of 10 on November 21, 2009, and every diner agreed that the food was bland at best, and service was slow and inattentive. Perhaps for some the decor will be enough to fool them into thinking they are experiencing 'fine dining',  but if you are someone with even a somewhat educated palate there are certainly better choices in Toronto in this price range. There were no balance of flavours, little creativity and not one wow. I make better food at home."}
{"text":"My meal at Globe Bistro was fantastic! I love that all the meat is antibiotic/hormone free!

The space is much larger than I anticipated. The atmosphere is earthy with high ceilings, dim lights, and wooden accents. The noise level was low. The service was excellent. The house made sour dough bread was perfection. They gave an amuse bouche before the meal which I think is a very nice touch. 

We had:
Mushroom salad - 5/5 OMG so good. A beautiful selection of delicious mushrooms with a truffled cauliflower puree 

Beef tar tar - my husband had this. He loved it. I can not rate it as I didn't try it. 

Mains:
Beef tenderloin - 4/5 This was very good. Not a large portion, but enough to satisfy me. I even took some home. The sides were very tasty but a bit skimpy. 

Elk - 4/5 This was delicious. 

Side: Braised lentils 5/5 OMG soo tasty!

Desert:
caramelized apple cake - 5/5 WOW this was heaven.

I will definitely be back to Globe Bistro and recommend it to anyone who values quality, local ingredients."}
{"text":"This winterlicious I ventured to three restaurants with the promotion and this was the best of the bunch. I was actually surprised because I didn't expect it to be my favourite but the food, service and ambiance exceeded the other restaurants that I tried. 

For my appetizer, I started with the butternut squash soup. It was superb and tasted fantastic. Next, I tried the Seared Bison Flank Steak with kale and fries I believe. They substituted the potato croquette for me, since I'm gluten intolerant. My steak was really good and I really enjoyed the kale and other vegetables. For dessert, they brought me a cranberry sorbet Sunday with meringues. It tasted fantastic!  The sorbet was tart and the meringue was really sweet. Together it was the perfect combination and it was presented extremely well. 

Globe is a really long and narrow restaurant. Our waitress showed us the rest of the restaurant after our meal and it was really nice. There is a lot of dark mahogany wood in the restaurant and the lighting is really nice. The ambiance is perfect for a date. 

They have a wonderful party room that holds 50 people and you only have to spend $1000 on food to rent it out. That is really easy to do with about 10-15 people. They told us that they can really glam it up for weddings and tons of other events. I will definitely go back to Globe Bistro and I might even have an event there. It's definitely worth a trip to enjoy their delicious food. The best part is, they accommodate food intolerances and allergies and the food tastes superb!"}
{"text":"You'll notice that most of the reviews for this place are based on Summerlicious or Winterlicious coupon experiences. There is one simple reason, and that is that this place is VERY pricey. Perhaps I'm a bit biased because I've eaten all around Toronto my entire life and had the privilege to have lived in several other countries in the world and I know for a fact that you can find FANTASTIC food at much more reasonable prices just about anywhere if you try. 

At these prices, it's hard to complain about the quality of the food because they better get it right but in many cases, the food has become more art than satisfaction and let's be honest. Food needs to elate you and bring excitement to our mouth! Why else do we go out to eat?

So fine, the food is good here but the portions are half asses and the prices are outrageous. That being said, I won't blame them for their business decisions because as long as there are people in the world who want to spend more money for less just because it's a show of status, then the owners of Globe deserve to profit from their customer's vanity.

If it's important for you to spend lots of money on pretty good food that is presented with excellence, then you'll enjoy Globe. If you like to get value from the restaurants you go to and you don't care about the environment but focus more on the taste of what you're eating, then you'll get much better value all around the city. 

Toronto is a true Gem of a city for restaurants so go adventuring like I have! :D"}
{"text":"Okay, so I here we go!
First Impression- 0/5- My first experience was bad right off the bat.  I had bought a Groupon and decided to check it out.  I had booked a reservation for my husband and I online through Open Table for the last day of the deal Dec 27th and mentioned my Groupon and phone number in case of any problems.  I received a call back from Elsie saying that if you HAVE to come then okay, but it would be better you came another night and that they decided to extending the Groupon until January 24 and she said to book and reserve a WEEK in advance.  WHAT?  Are you kidding me? First of all we decided to reschedule for sure as we felt unimportant and an inconvenience.  We were shocked that a restaurant would say that-busy or not! Groupon or not!
The visit- 1/5 our first entry in the restaurant we knew we must have been greeted by the same server everyone talks about in the reviews (which I am guessing is the same lady we spoke to over the phone).  Again, like it would kill her to crack a smile or be friendly and approachable.
Ambiance- 4/5- I have to say I really appreciated.  Great lighting, art and clean washrooms!
Staff- 4/5- Aside from \"Sad Sally\" staff was awesome and really a pleasure.  We had Stacey? (I Think) and we LOVED her!  She did a fab job.
Food- 2.5/5- Was really looking forward to this as we love the \"Globe\" concept.  A waiter did offer us a small tasting as compliments of the kitchen which was very nice.  But, overall I have to agree with other reviews here.  Food was very mediocre and some of it was really blah in my opinion.  Look at it this way, I would never order it again, let alone pay a whopping $100 for the meal! Presentation is really the only excitement you got out of the food.  My husband also did leave hungry which is never a good sign.  Yea it was a tasting, but it was also 5 courses!
Wine- like every restaurant WAY overpriced.

Would I go back? nah, pretty sure I wouldn't 
Would it be worth the cost? nah, def not, it's overpriced
Would I recommend? Sorry, gotta be honest, I wish I could say yes as management looked as though they were trying hard, but no neither of us will return."}
{"text":"This review is for a wedding reception at the restaurant.

The food: amazing! 
- hors d'oeuves - delicious, though inconsistently cooked mini burgers, warming veggie pakora, unique and super yummy fish thing on top of a crispy home made potato chip
- even though this is a restaurant, as it was a wedding, I was expecting the usual rubbery chicken. Not so! The scallop with pork belly (?) appetizers were succulent. The trout was a fine balance between delicate flesh and crispy, irresistible skin. The panna cotta is a plate of subtle flavours that just slides down your throat. I had some of my Hubby's brownie, and I couldn't get enough.

The service: really nice! 
- everyone was super efficient. One of the ladies came out into the cold to help move stuff before the wedding. The kitchen staff in the open kitchen were really engaging as well. We got a special order of a double decker mini burger as he heard us joking about it.

The decor: went really well for the wedding my friends were going for
- dark, dinner atmosphere that was appropriate for the occasion, with just enough edge that suited my friends' personalities 

The space: the only thing that was a wee bit awkward for the event
- multi-level space works well for a restaurant, not so amazing for a wedding. People were essentially scattered into different spaces. Half of the main space had to be cleared away after dinner for the dance floor.

Overall, a very positive experience. Great food, good fun and a happy occasion with a beautiful bride. The entire restaurant was reserved for the wedding."}

{"text":"I went to Globa Bistro for summerliocus with friends for their 2017 menu.

The restaurant was pretty fancy with high hanging chandeliers and dim lighting. Maybe not the best for photos. 

App: I got the steal tartare which was great. It was presented in a very big plate. The taste was fresh yet nutty. It came with a creamy sauce almost similar to mayonnaise. On top were some small green leafs used for garnishing.

Main: I ordered the pork shank that was served in a BBQ sauce ontop of a nutty flavoured sauce. The pork was moist and soft once I cut into the meat. 

Dessert: I ordered the shortcake with strawberry ice cream. I absolutely loved it. It came with a big piece of white chocolate on top as decor as well. :)"}
{"text":"This review is based on 2017 Summerlious. It is a great lunch dining experience. I found their Summerlious menu is nice and offers a great selection of choices, very good value!

For the appetizer, the Peach Gazpacho is very light and refreshing, excellent soup for summer taste. The presentation of Potato Salad is interesting......the taste is not bad, even I'm not a vegetarian I like this potato salad. The Steak Tartare is excellent with pleasantly strong sesame oil flavor. I like their aioli and the texture of the tartare, my favorite appetizer.

There are five options for the Mains, giving you enough choices to choose=). BBQ Pork Wings is highly recommended. It smells very good when delivered to the table. The pork wing goes well with the BBQ sauce, very tasty. The texture of the Lake Trout is perfect! I like the delicate flavor, nice and fresh. The pasta is of the average quality. 

The pannacotta is a little bit too sweet for me but hazelnut meringue is not bad. I also tried the shortcake. To be honest, I'm not a fan of their desserts. 

Overall, I like this restaurant~"}
{"text":"I went for a tasting menu to Globe Bistro and it was simply excellent. The service was good and the food was delicious. The Almond cake for dessert was the best I have ever eaten. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We come here because we purchased a Groupon tasting menu dinner for 4. Overall rating I would say 3.5 stars but for sure not 4. 

The decor is nice but abit  dark in terms of lighting. At least dark for me, but fortunately the sun is still up so it's not that bad. The place is clean and neatly decorated and the server is quite friendly! The service is good from my standard.

Ok to the food.... it's the tasting menu so there are about 6 little dishes we get to try. The presentation of each dish is nice but somehow it lacks the WOW factor from the taste perspective. Interestingly enough, besides the 6 dishes, the restaurant also provide two more items as extra as complimentary... ironically, and it's these two items that I liked most. One is the fried pork belly, it's really flavourful and do gives me the WOW yummy reaction... and the other one I think is the palette cleanser- blue berry sorbet, rich in blue berry flavour! Yum...

Back to the tasting menu, the first course is the soup, I think it's pumpkin soup with some chilli powder and a drop of sesame oil- average I think.
 Actually I would prefer they skip the sesame oil because as me having the Asian palette, having this soup somehow reminds me the taste from eating instant noodles. Lol.. it's just me, I don't even know how I get this association. Then come the salad, which are all cabbage but made in different ways. Again just average, not much cabbage flavour. Then come the tuna, but the tuna has no fish taste that I expect from sashimi, but presentation is nice. Then come the beef and then cheese plate and then dessert... but u get the idea, average taste for each dish. 

From the price point, it's about $50 per person from the Groupon, so maybe it's the price that drive the food quality.. all in all, an average dining experience for me from the food tasting perspective."}

Tasked with finding a patio that was smoker-friendly, I stumbled upon Globe Bistro, the sister restaurant to Earth (Rosedale).  I had had a stellar dining experience at Earth; I had high hopes for Globe.

We arrived promptly for our 6:30PM reservation and found ourselves a seat on their rooftop patio.  The patio layout is quite nice with the bar to one side, and zebra-printed booth-like seats on the outer edges of the patio, which is encased by wooded walls.  I also saw heating lamps, which would've come in handy as the night went on.  It got rather chilly, but it was my fault for wearing sleeveless and not bringing a jacket!  Keep in mind that you will have to brave 3 flights of stairs to reach the roof-top patio, so you may want to leave gramps at home for this one!

The crowd ranged from all ages, both young and old.  As the night got on, the restaurant got busier - but still relatively half empty for a Saturday night.  Perhaps with TIFF taking place, all the restaurant-goers' attention has diverted to the Yorkville area?The bartender would also double as the server tonight, which made for inattentive, slow service which was insult to injury on top of small food portions with a big price tag.

Ms. B ordered a half bottle of 2007 Henry Pelham Chardonnay instead of her usual half litre because it was cheaper.  Later in the evening, to her dismay, she would find out that an 80z. glass of wine would cost her almost the same as a half bottle ($12 vs. $19).  Because I was chaffeuring tonight, I limited myself to an 8oz. glass of Rosé, ringing in at $9.

We ordered 2 appetizers, a main, and dessert to share.The Butter Poached Lobster was served with a black truffle potato \"risotto,\" fried zucchini pesto and Toscano cheese.  We were served the claw, which made for a firmer texture.  The potato risotto was quite delicious, and if I had not referred back to the menu I would've been tricked into thinking it was jicama.  The batter was not too heavy on the oil.  Overall, this dish scores great from a taste perspective, but from a textural perspective, I would've used a different part of the lobster as I found the claw meat to be rather \"tough.\"

Our second appetizer of the evening was the \"Asparagus\" Salad.  I use the term asparagus sparingly as there was more arugula than asparagus.  The asparagus spears are thinly sliced and there was one random asparagus floret in the salad somewhere.  It was a light and refreshing salad sprinkled with toasted almonds, and lemon oil with a round of fried ricotta.  Overall, a yummy salad - and a decent size for an appetizer salad.I really had a hard time picking a main as they all sounded so enticing.  However, at the end we settled for the Duck Confit which consisted of a yarn ball, duck breast, a bed of greens, baby parsnips and finished with an apricot jus.  I found the duck breast to be slightly overcooked which took a few more bites to properly digest.  The yarn ball was quite creative and was bits of shredded duck, that was encased with \"yarn.\"  The yarn ball, from a textural perspective, loosely resembled a taro \"nest\" that you would most often see at a Chinese restaurant that would contain a celery, snap beans and seafood melange of sorts.  The yarn ball was a culinary piece of art, but alas, the overcooked duck breast brought it down a notch.

Their dessert list was rather disappointing but in the end we opted for the Callebaut Chocolate Mousse which was served with a bacon nougatine, espresso brownies and strawberry ice wine gelée.  The chocolate mousse was encased by a chocolate shell, which was rather solid and hard to break through.  Ours almost went flying off the plate!  I also ordered a coffee to go with dessert and found it to leave a really dry aftertaste in my mouth.  I am quite a picky coffee drinker, and theirs is one I would not order again.

Verdict

Globe Bistro fell short of my expectations.  With its small portion sizes, pricey menu and lax service I can say with certainty that I probably won't be back again with the plethora of options available in Toronto.

The ambiance and patio are what I would say are the selling points to this restaurant.  I will add that all their dishes are beautifully presented and appealing, just not very satisfying.  It'd be a great place to go to impress your date with the amount of money you'd be dropping on the table.  Our bill came to about $112 before tip which, we felt, was money better spent elsewhere.

I definitely had two polar opposite experiences at Earth and Rosedale.  I would definitely go back to Earth, but Globe?  Me thinks not!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Sun night, party of 2 and sat on their rooftop patio. It's 2 flights of stairs to get up there, so be prepared for that. You can't actually see much from the patio because the walls are so high, they have a few awnings to cover the sun/rain. The bench seats were kind of dirty, you could see people ass shapes based on the dirt patterns. My date ordered the Pappardelle which has no meat and I had the Pickeral. Both dishes were done well and delicious. It felt like it took a while to get the food, maybe 25min considering the restaurant was only half full it could have been a bit faster. It was very nice and quiet though so a great spot to actually have a conversation. I've dined here before for their tasting menu which was amazing."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious with my girlfriends on a Sunday afternoon. We wanted to come Saturday, but they weren't open at lunch time. 

The place is quite nice. Narrow, but 2 levels and seats a lot. I also think one of the reasons is that there are only 2 single stall bathrooms. I guess that saves a lot of real estate, but proves to be inconvenient a little. Depends on your luck I guess. 

The Summerlicious menu had a lot of choice, but was a little deceiving. The really appetizing looking Black Cod App, was actually a mashed potato type thing served with chips. Other choices were Fennel Salad (it was okay, fancy coleslaw) and a Cold Gazpacho soup. 
As for the mains, my friends got the steak (other choices were Pickerel and a quiche type thing). The meat was quite tender, and they seems pleased with it. 
Dessert was a Chocolate torte, panna cotta and a berry 'mess' (like a parfait). They both got the torte, it looked a little dry, but they liked it and couldn't finish it because it was quite filling. 

Because I have dietary restrictions, I couldn't get anything I really wanted on this menu (quiche/pannacotta) so I decided to go on their Brunch menu. 

It looked good, with some egg options and a goat cheese crepe. I got the Swine and Dine. It was essentially Eggs with Toast and Pork 6 ways (aka fatty fatty fatty bacon type things). 
It was disappointing that on a Sunday Brunch at 12pm she had to inform me that the Confit of Pork was unavailable.  It's this early, and this means that the chef just didn't bother to get it. Meaning also, that I am being ripped off a little as I am getting LESS than I paid for. Also, when I asked her to describe to me what exactly will I be getting on my plate, she was not helpful at all and couldn't really answer me. 
No matter. 
I got salad instead of toast, and egg yolk scrambled only. It came with bacon, fatty bacon, some fried fatness, sausage and more bacon and 3 mushrooms.  To be honest I only saw the pork 4 ways, when it should be 5. 

When we paid, we had three credit cards and asked her to pay different amounts on each. She came back and said it's not possible to add the tip on the credit card like that, so...? I've never seen this happen before, and wondering if it's just the server trying to get her share of tip. What I don't understand is that the total amount will be more than what the total would be, and therefore the difference is her tip. 
Anyway, she reluctantly went back and split the bill to our respective meals when we told her. 

It was okay, wouldn't be on my list to try again however."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the commentary regarding the lingering around getting food to the table.  Beyond that, this place is really quite nice, upscale, friendly, and exciting.

I went with a few friends to a Bees & Honey event, which was SUPER interesting (they have beehives on the roof!), delicious and fun.  The honey they are preparing is really light and yummy!

As it was a weeknight, my companions were not happy with the long drawn-out time to get various dishes to table.  I certainly was having a good time, meeting people, and tried to ignore my friends' gripes, but, eventually, even I agreed we needed to leave as the next course was coming out past 10:30pm (started around 7), and this was a weeknight.  I would suggest that this ship probably could be tightened for weeknight adventures.

Overall, though, I really enjoy this place, the ownership is friendly and the staff was very responsive and helpful.  The food is nicely presented and I certainly enjoyed trying some unique flavours out."}
{"text":"Quite dark but I like this. Classy but not pretentious. Courteous and trained service. Truly considerate, accommodating and consistent. The food is well prepared and the  staff is helpful. The only very nice place for a special occasion in the area. Yet, you can still have a first-rate locally farmed burger or battered haddock from their bar menu. Call ahead and pick up; they will tell you truthfully how long you can expect to wait; sit at the bar and they will make you welcome while you wait. Much better burger and immensely better service than Allens. I go here regularly."}
{"text":"Decor - modern, clean look

Environmental-consious restaurant - single ply tissue paper, one time use towel instead of paper towel, pressure toilet for use of less water, water bottle for serving says - think global, buy local

Service - 4 stars out of 5.  The night I was there, the hostess was okay, not much smiles, enthusiasm but did her part to sit us down and take our jackets.  Server was experienced.  The junior server had the best attitude out of the 3, lots of smiles, polite, but obviously in-training as she pardoned herself for forgetting one part of the dish.. but out of the 3, she gave the most welcoming experience for us.  

Layout - one long table on one end, the tables were way too close to one another.  By the time we left, the restaurant wasn't full, but they still sat us really close to other people.  I can recap what was said at the table next to us because we were seated so closely.

Food - 5 course tasting menu.  Menu unknown until served.  
1. butternut squash soup with thyme oil and hazelnuts
2. Arugula salad on a bed of Quinoa, topped with 2 slices of watermelon radishes and ricotta cheese
3. one scallop on beans and tomatoes
4. Pork tenderloin on risotto, with mushroom and crispy kale
5. Dessert (Roasted Marshmallow ice-cream on brownie, with caramel sauce) or Artisan Canadian cheeses

Review of the food
Portion - small, the soup was so small-portion that when my spoon tried to scoop it up at first try that it already touched the bottom of the bowl.  
Taste - everything was not hot enough, lukewarm soup, scallop and tenderloin... to the point my husband and I thought they may have just put the dishes in the food warmers.... The tenderloin was cooked very well though, with good sauce, probably because of a touch of special oil.. The tenderloin was not overcooked, just right... still a little pink.. risotto was very creamy.  Brownie was a little bit burnt but was nicely paired with the Marshmallow ice cream

Went with a groupon gift but if I have to pay the same amount of money paid for the groupon or original price, probably would have gone somewhere else.. mainly because the food was mediocre.  Overall had a good time because the service staff was good and professional."}
{"text":"The Globe Bistro has a beautiful rooftop patio which has bar seating along with several tables. We came for drinks before dinner but decided to try an order of steak frites. The steak was okay - cooked as we asked for. The fries and salad were okay as well - just small portions. The server was attentive and friendly. I would be back for drinks but feel like the food was on the expensive side. It was just okay and the portions were on the smaller side."}
{"text":"Went for winterlicious lunch today. I'm so sad to say that this restaurant was such a disappointment. First of all... They took 2 hours to serve all my three courses. The mushroom soup was mediocre. It was mostly just broth. Plating was sad. The albacore tuna appetizer was good. My trout main fish was very good. It was perfectly cook and had good flavour. The steak main was disappointing. Requested medium rare steak and it was really undercooked and chewy. The brussels sprouts were really good. I didn't see the point of the kettle cooked chips on the side. The chips did not add anything to the dish. It was bland. We had the sorbet and the pumpkin cheesecake. I have never come across any desert which I couldn't eat until today. The sorbet was so sugary.. It tasted like cheap fruit juice and that rice water tasting puree was just disgusting. The pumpkin cheesecake was dense but the crumble on top was just pure crunchy sugar. I hope  management of Globe really puts some thought in their desserts and the service quality. The restart was so dead but yet it took 2 hours to get my three courses ."}
{"text":"Call in advance and they'll make a FRESH gluten-free pasta! Oysters on the menu, very very nicely done."}
{"text":"I have tried the tasting menu here twice. I have to say the first time I came here (which was quiet a while ago) I really enjoyed my experience and the food on the tasting menu. However, recently, I came back again with a group of friends to try their tasting menu again. Overall, I thought the service was good, but the food took a long time between courses. The food on the tasting menu, in my opinion, was satisfactory (I thought the tasting menu from my past experience was better). Besides the long time it took between the courses, I believe they forgot the pallet cleanser course - because I saw the other table that was having the same things as our table got the pallet cleanser, but we didn't. In all, the experience was good, but I think this time the food was just average."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Dinner 2015 

Here's the long and short of it: The service level for an establishment at Globe is inexplicably bad. The servers themselves were friendly and really lovely people but they were extremely forgetful and inattentive. Why is it that every time we run out of water that I have to HOLLA (twice... thrice sometimes) to get refills? 

Redeeming points: 
+Lovely ambiance
+I had to take an important work call and one of the servers led me to the unused private function room.

Selections
Appetizer: Summer Salad (Heirloom tomatoes, lettuce hearts, radish, carrots, sugar snap peas, fresh sheep's milk cheese, dill)
Entree: Summer Mezze (Roasted eggplant, chick pea purée, tabbouleh, cherry tomatoes, pickled turnips, spiced yogurt)
Dessert: Summer Peach Melba (Peach sorbet, raspberry purée, crunchy meringue)"}
{"text":"This is spectacular. I had to actually kiss the chef because our meals were just overwhelmingly delicious.

The menu is eclectic and creative using all local and if not local, then all Canadian products, including the fish and meats and vegetables. I've never had that experience before.

The restaurant itself is gorgeous with a lovely front bistro area and a large dining space in back with a mezzanine for extra seating. It's tastefully decorated and elegant. There is an upstairs patio which was closed because it's still quite cold.

Back to the chef and his glorious food. We had the kimchee...kimchee like I have never had. It was in a light tempura batter and a sauce with cilantro sprigs. This was amazing. And it was nice and hot having come right out of the kitchen.

I had the burger and Brussels sprouts...all served with maple bacon!

Was so full, I had no room for dessert. But I will be back and get it then.

The service is great, as well, with an attentive and charming waitstaff. 

You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of eating here a few times for special occasions.  I love that it's local based and ethical food, though some is beyond my palate (e.g., elk). It is definitely a great place for a lovely and evening-long dinner with friends but be prepared for the cost. I love that it used to be a bowling alley."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars

I've been to this restaurant before (for dinner) and decided to go for brunch with friends.  It's located on Danforth, close to Broadway station so easily accessible by TTC and plenty of parking nearby.

This place from the outside looks small but it's long and narrow inside and can accommodate a lot of people surprisingly- even 2nd floor seating that could be used for private events.  The inside has that luxe feeling with beautiful chandeliers and interpretive art that people love to look at but no one really gets.

The brunch menu is decent in selection with the normal brunch menu with a twist.  The prices are fairly reasonable as well.  I had the grilled cheese with 3 cheeses and tomato chutney and a side salad.  My friend had the eggs benny florentine and my other friend had the reuben.  The reuben and the eggs were pretty good but the grilled cheese was just not that delicious cheesiness that i wanted.  The cheeses they used didn't really go together unfortunately- one overpowered the taste of everything.  The side salad came drenched in dressing-I could barely finish it b/c the dressing was super tart.

The service was lacklustre to say the least.  Everyone was nice and polite but it took forever and a day to get someone to take our order or pay the bill.  We had to ask someone to get our server.  It probably added an extra 20-25 min onto our brunch of just waiting.  And it wasn't even that busy yet. 

No rush to go back but I have heard there is an outdoor patio that is nice so maybe in the summer I will try again"}
{"text":"We were here for a friend's birthday this evening,  it was a large party of about 35 and the service was/is slow.  The reservation was for 6:30pm and it's 9:55pm and we have yet to be served our third course (of 3 courses) + cake.  Don't expect reasonable service here.  The food is/was good but they are stingy like really stingy with the butter.  I think we asked for extra butter 3 times.  I guess they have a butter shortage?!?  That having been said the food is tasty.  The butternut squash purée is delicious, as was the tagliatelle ~ I'm excited for our pending dessert to arrive but goodness it's so slow.  At least one of the guests raided one of the kids plates because they were so hungry.  I've been to globe a few times before but no prior experience was as disappointing as this one.  I had actually had looked into this place as a wedding venue and thank goodness I didn't.  We would have been starving.  It's too bad because the food is tasty.  If only recommend this for smaller parties.  It's clear to me that serving big groups is far outside the expertise of this establishment."}
{"text":"I made reservartions to come on a Friday night at 8:30 and right after they asked me for my name and number, they got straight to the point in asking \"Are you here for the Groupon deal?\" I wasn't sure whether to feel a little offended (because if I wasn't, how was that supposed to make me feel). I'm probably just being over sensitive and I'm sure they wanted to make sure they had enough portions. Funny enough - from the time I bought the groupon to now (which is probably over 6 months ago), the price of their 5 course meal has actually dropped by $10.... meh I got a deal any way right?

I walked in on time to a beautiful interior with high ceilings and very cool linking loopy chandeliers, with dim lighting and a romantic setting. The room totally reminded me of WEST in Vancouver - long and narrow but still spacious. Our server was really polite, and patient, but the patience soon became long waits for her to come by, and missing in action for a lot of it.

The complimentary bread came with a walnut and raisin butter, along with regular butter - nice tough and bread was fresh and soft. What came next was a pickerel croquette which was flavourful, and complimented well with the aioli it rested on.

The first course was a cauliflower puree soup with bacon crisps and aged cheddar. At first taste, the soup was not even close to luke warm - S tried mine and said his was better, although I thought his wasn't up to par after. I got it sent back and the second bowl that came out was definitely steaming.... wondering where my first bowl was sitting. I could have done without the bacon bits because I'm not a bacon fan, but it added saltiness and texture to it, along with the cheddar.

Second course was an asparagus and arugula salad with goat cheese. This was one of the better courses with lots of flavours and textures, and different varieties of ingredients.

Third course was a very small tasting piece of perch on a bed of lemon couscous with tomato pepper sauce. The fish was very potent and if you are not a fan of fishiness, then this isn't for you. I thought the taste was nice, although the skin was a little tough to cut through. There was not much citrus to the couscous although the pepper tomato sauce gave each bite a nice kick to it. 

Fourth course - main - was pork tenderloin over a bed of kale with some sort of barley ( I think). The sauce was delicious and the pork was super tender. Definitely my favourite dish of the night... and wish I knew how to make it too!

Last course, we opted not to get cheese, although our waitress assumed that we were ordering one of each and brought it out to us without even asking first... odd. We got two of the dessert plates which consisted of one round and one oval shaped pear roasted with tobacco parisian macaron with chocolate toule. Maybe the tabacco was in the chocolate because I didn't taste it in the macaron at all. It was very soft and very well made - so soft I actually could not pick it up with my hands. Wish there was more pear flavour because it is my absolute favourite but I was super happy with how the last plate finished off.

The food was not what disappointed me tonight.. it was definitely the service. With the cold soup, and plates being served while we had not been given new cutlery, or watching the servers bring our plates to another table only to come back to present it to us... I didn't think we received much attention at all throughout the night. They were either short staffed as it seemed like one woman was handling the entire line of tables, and half the time she seemed scattered brained and running all over the place. At one point, she had forgotten what course she was serving to one table, and told another table the wrong main course. It was a little tough to watch while being in the middle of it all. I was really surprised at how amateur it felt.

It was worth trying, but won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"as we walked in to globe bistro i felt like i owned everything.  i felt like all my minions had hovered around me and did their best not to be the unlucky one that would be on the receiving end of my beatings or floggings maybe.  i felt like everything was a little precious.

that being said, it is quite elegant there.  too bad i wasnt on a date.  i was with my dad.  thanks dad.  nonetheless, i debated what to get for a while (i always do that) and noticed that the pork belly came with greens.  \"oh, thats good\" i thought.  \"it cant be that unhealthy then; why, with those greens im sure to get the requisite number of veggies in.  i daresay that by ordering this i will have even combined two courses!\"

there was one leaf of romain lettuce reaching out of the pork belly for dear life.

now the pork belly WAS great.  and then i had a steak.

with a whole bunch of onion rings around it.

AND a cheese plate of some really stinky cheese after that.

....and a grappa.

plus some wine before...and maybe the remainder of my dads wine...(i was only being responsible...he had to drive home...wine shouldnt be wasted.)

some cool things about the dishes:  it seems their signature move is the foam.  on one of my dishes there was a blue cheese type foam.  not styrofoam, but more like soap suds.  but it tasted good.  and everything was cooked to perfection.

and its all canadian.

but i do think its all a bit foofy.  great food can be served in a place that welcomes a little bit of noise, community, laughter.  even formal weddings arent usually that formal.

but then again...for a nice date..."}
{"text":"New Year's Eve was a great disappointment. The service was extremely slow and our server seemed overwhelmed and panicked the entire time. Managers were even helping control her section but to no avail. It seemed the entire restaurant was understaffed and this contributed to the poor service. After 10 years of NYE events, management should have had the staffing figured out. The food was mediocre, at best and I had to send my main entree back. I couldn't even finish it once it was brought back to the table. It still wasn't cooked properly. Bread wasn't offered and our wine was warm. The entertainment was lacklustre. The guitar was too loud which made having a conversation difficult and the singer was basically a glorified karaoke singer. This was not the jazz entertainment that had been advertised. Please address these issues. We paid a lot of money for a horrible NYE celebration."}
{"text":"Another great meal at the Globe Bistro this week.  We had the tasting menu for 4, and all of the courses were delicious.  The service was exceptional - a shout out to Stacey for her great service and wonderful sense of humour."}
{"text":"Globe Bistro can do no wrong in my books.  

If you want a to have a meal at a nice restaurant without the snooty servers and pretentious clientele, Globe Bistro is your best bet.  The space is beautiful, they feature local ingredients, have an amazing wine list and the servers are always professional, friendly and knowledgeable.  

I love going there for brunch as the food is always excellent.  There is usually something for everyone and they're pretty good at accommodating special requests.  Also, they take reservation so you never have to line up for an hour just to eat there."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to spending my birthday at the Globe for quite some time. We made our reservation weeks ago. So I was a little disappointed when the hostess tried to seat us in the casual front dining area which was practically empty. Since we had been here several times before, we knew the rear dining area is significantly more formal.  (Think first class vs. economy.) 

When we put up a fuss, the manager found us a table for two but needed time to get it ready. We had a seat at the abandoned bar where we were ignored for an awkward amount of time and as soon as we ordered a drink, the table was ready. 

I felt a little uncomfortable because it seemed like we were inconveniencing them but in the end, I'm glad we stood our ground and requested this table. The ambiance was so much nicer and we did explain that this was a special occasion.  

We shared the Digby Bay scallops to start. While we were waiting for our mains, we noticed all the other tables had complimentary bread. We asked our waiter if we could please have some too and someone brought it over in the next couple of minutes. 

The duo of elk at $39 was a tad over priced but very tender and flavourful. The rainbow trout with chestnut cream was light and fresh. I'm usually underwhelmed by the desserts but we tried the pavlova and I have to say it was probably the best dessert I've ever had in a restaurant. 

To my delight they offered Spanish coffee as well. I'm a huge fan of this old fashioned drink and the Globe did it right in the traditional tall glass mug rimmed with sugar and topped with a dollop of fresh whipped cream.

So in the end, I had no complaints about the quality of the food but a high end restaurant can not stand on food alone. I was not impressed with the way we were treated."}
{"text":"The space is great. Hold out for the rooftop patio!  Service was a bit slow but the food made up for the wait.  Pork belly eggs benedict ... Need I say more!?"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised - excellent service, great venue, delicious food, presentation, staff are great and it's a historic bowling alley!  Decor was nice lists of space and wonderful central neighbourhood - a true 4.5 star!"}
{"text":"Excellent dishes made with fresh, often local ingredients. I enjoyed a delicious dish of grilled trout, as well as an outstanding salad of several varieties of heirloom tomato. Definitely an expensive meal however: about $50 for appetizer and main course."}
{"text":"Very good food but the portions are a bit on the small side.  This is probably the most expensive place on the Danforth.  Opened about a year ago, but I just got to go, since their prices are quite high ($38 for 10oz striploin).

They have three floors, rooftop patio, private events room and the service is very polite and friendly.  The Dinner menu is very expensive, but the Bistro menu is more reasonably priced.  The portions are small for the money, but the quality of the ingredients is amazing!

I had the steak tips with salad, which was actually a very good sliced steak, not the tip leftovers like in other places for $21, and my buddy had the burger, which could have been bigger for $18.

The Almond Creme Brullee with raspberry reduction and vanilla ice cream eclair was sooo delicious and decadent!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

I came here with my family on Mother's Day for their \"famous\" brunch. Prior to going in, I browsed the menu online and saw they had a pretty good brunch menu. Needless to say, I was pretty excited to bring my mom here.

The decor and ambiance of the place was really nice. That's one positive note.

After we were seated, we were presetned with a Mother's Day Brunch menu, a prix fixe menu for $29. I asked our waitress (forgot her name.. lucky her), if they were serving their regular brunch menu to which her reply was.. 

Her- \"No, we aren't, just the Mother's Day brunch\"
Me- \"Oh, no one told me\"
Her- \"Well someone should have told you when you made reservations, do you want to speak to a manager?\"

I wasn't even complaining, but simply asking a question. No need to push me to the manager so hastily.

I wish I could say that was the extent of my bad experience here but it was not.

We all ordered from the prix fixe and waited for our food. We were served coffee and juice with scones that failed to rise in the oven. Who was expediting this food? It tasted good, but they were flat. Not what I expect at a place like this. Not to mention the cream for our coffee had some grey and black fuzz floating around in it. Twice.

All the ladies ordered the grilled eggplant with quinoa and whipped goat cheese for appetizer. No where in the description did it say eggplant marinated in garam masala, but that's what we got. A large portion of garam masala and a dash full of disappointment. The men ordered the tomato soup. It wasn't too bad if you like eating pasta sauce straight from the can.

For mains, 3 of us ordered the rainbow trout and the other 3 ordered the mushroom pasta. Both of these were actually good. The skin on the fish was crispy and it went nice with the lentils. I tried some of the pasta too and it was nice. They put a bunch of roasted garlic cloves in there too, which is always good. The only complaint I have about the mains were, one of the pasta portions was clearly larger than the other two.

For dessert, eveyone ordered the sticky toffee pudding. Everyone's came out looking nice and clean and mine looked like someone in the kitchen took a huge bite of out it. Rather than complaining and having someone spit in my food, I just sucked it up, but only after mentioning it to my party so that my waitress could hear. 

I was very disappointed in the whole experience. If I had come here on a normal brunch day the food would have probably been good, and this 1 star review would be a 3 or a 4. Unfortunately, they decided to be rude and serve their crazy idea of a brunch."}
{"text":"Incredible. I did the $55 tasting menu and was blown away by every course. The chef alone gets 5 stars. Service was on point without being overbearing. Will be back many times I'm sure. Bravo!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation for mother's day and the place was about 3/4 full. We were seated immediately and in a fairly friendly manner. Our server was very cheery and tended to our table in a satisfactory manner. She was kind enough to humour our wish to see the rooftop patio even though it was closed due to the rain. Appetizers came out in a reasonable amount of time but it was over an hour before our mains arrived and the server didn't say anything until we started asking, it was as if they were hoping we didn't notice? There was also no consideration given for the long delay on our bill but the drinks were removed after we pointed it out.
Special of the day, red pepper soup, was just ok. The duck was ok, it was cooked well but I just didn't like the flavour combination. Those who ordered the steak and the elk said they were cooked to perfection.
So they lose a star for, what I felt was, being a bit overpriced and one for slow meal service.
There is a lot of reasonable street parking in the area, the restaurant doesn't have their own lot.

With the many other places to try, we won't be going back to Globe Bistro anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went for our Summerlicious dinner, and this place certainly didn't disappoint. 

For our starters, we enjoyed the roasted red pepper gazpacho which was sweet and bold. A perfect mix for summer. We also ordered the elk sausage which was quite possibly the best sausage I've ever tasted. The portions for the starters were almost enough to constitute a full meal. 

For the main course, which were once again generously portioned, we ordered the rigatoni and the pork loin. Both dishes were on point, and full of so many amazing flavors. The pork loin was not dry in the slightest, which was a delightful surprise. 

For our desserts (our favorite part), we tried the peaches and cream and the chocolate ice cream cake. I can't honestly describe the joy on both of our faces as we were eating these desserts. O-M-G is truly the only thing that comes to mind. 

Throughout our dinner we were treated to an amazing bottle of Chardonnay based on the input from our server. Bottles are half-priced on Sundays so that's a huge plus. And our server treated us to a little dessert wine on the house. 

Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and we will definitely be coming back again. Great service, great food, and a great space."}
{"text":"Me and my friends came here for Winterlicious last week, and after having spent some time to think on it, I would still say this place was just average. With a mid-sized group, we were seated in a somewhat strange area - in a corner edge near the hallway that connects to the kitchen entrance and the front bar area. It wasn't the worst thing, it was just weird having people and staff brush by when it got bottle-necked in that little hallway area. Anyway, we had came for Winterlicious and upon receiving our menus we were surprised to find that the Winterlicious menu posted online wasn't the same as the one we got when we sat down. Asking about this discrepancy, the staff simply told us it was just what they had in season, or some variation of that. Not a big deal, it's just that we really wanted to try certain items on the menu that weren't there anymore.. a bit disappointing.
Anyway, the food that we did get was somewhat lacking. My country terrine was dry, and the toast that it came with even drier. Some friends got the Butternut squash consomme for their starter, and the wuxi wellington rib as their main - they were not impressed. The overall feeling was that the food was just okay to mediocre, and definitely on the small side of portions; we were all quite hungry shortly afterwards. 
If there's one silver lining to our dining experience it was that our waitress was very attentive and came by to check on us often, refill our drinks, etc. This might have something to do with the 18% gratuity they tack on to groups of 6 or more, or that it wasn't very busy, but there you go. Probably won't be going back for a second try, as I feel like there's better (and cheaper) alternatives out there that are more worthwhile for the price."}
{"text":"AmaZing food!! We were a party of 6 and we all enjoyed our food.. I had the meat tartar, tenderloin and the delicious apple cake and i enjoyed each bite in every plate!.. Defiantly one of my favorites restaurants .."}
{"text":"+.5 for service

Globe Bistro was my first summerlicious stop for 2015, and my first one in the $35 dinner category.

The interior of this restaurant is quite dark, and it didn't help that my glasses were still tinted from the transitions. It took me a while for my glasses to finally settle down, but it did. The restaurant wasn't that full, which was a bit surprising. Perhaps the whole Pan Am Games hype drove people away from eating out? I was also down by the Pan Am Park earlier that day and it was quite busy.

I ordered the smoked pickerel rillette, wild boar sausage, and the chocolate fudge brownie sundae. The waitress also served bread for us with vinaigrette and unsalted butter for starters, which was quite nice. The smoked pickerel rillette was very enjoyable, and had that Quebec foie gras feel. The wild boar sausage had a slightly weird texture, but I supposed that's what boar normally tastes like (I've never eaten wild boar until today). Finally, the chocolate fudge brownie sundae tasted excellent, and wasn't too overly sweet unlike some restaurants where they oversweet their desserts.

I also really like how all their food is sourced locally, as it supports local farmers and the local economy.

So it sounds like a 4 star review. Why did I only give it 3 stars? Unfortunately, when I come home that night, I had a huge diarrhea episode and had to use the washroom quite frequently. I think the sausage wasn't cooked thoroughly, or at least to a high enough temperature.

Otherwise service was excellent and we were attended to the whole way."}
{"text":"I don't know what was going on today, but the service was terrible! It took close to an hour for someone (the hostess I'm guessing as she didn't know the soup of the day and said she didn't normally work in the back room) to finally take our order. Then another 40 mins for food. It did not appear to be particularly busy and the floor seemed appropriately staffed, so there's really no excuse. They were out of the huevos, so I had a lacklustre grilled cheese that was not worth the wait. The first server abruptly left after only taking drink orders from some members of our party. We should have left and spent our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  We had the 6-course tasting menu and really enjoyed it.  Great variety and included things I would never order, but were delicious.
The Asparagus salad was my favourite of the 6 courses.  The duck was a close runner up.  Blueberry lemon sorbet halfway through to cleanse the palate was a nice touch. Very refreshing.  Almond cake with white chocolate mousse was the perfect way to end the meal.  Warning...the tasting menu is a lot of food.  Don't fill up on bread.  Food came out at a good pace. Not too fast, nor too slow. About 2 hours in total."}
{"text":"Visited Globe for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. Had the chilled asparagus soup, beef tenderloin and triple selection of ice cream for dessert.  We were 18 guests in total and all enjoyed our meals thoroughly.  The presentation, cut and sizes off the tenderloin were random on each plate but in all fairness this was an upgrade from the sirloin we were supposed to get.  The servers were excellent and well informed.  Will definitely pay them another visit!"}
{"text":"I am really torn about this restaurant. Love the decor, love the food, and the service is good too.  BUT, and an extremely large BUT...the food portions are WAY TOO SMALL!! especially for the price you pay.  My partner had the tortellini - he had 3 tortellini on his plate.  i had the elk - and received 2 small pieces of meat. :( Not good considering the high prices asked."}
{"text":"I came here last night for my boyfriend's office Christmas party (it's the second time they do it here, so I had been here before)

The menu for the night consisted of:
1) Canapés: Ribeye Mini Burgers - Red Onion & Smoked Bacon Jam
Shaved Foie Gras - Brioche Toast, Cherry Chutney
Lamb Kofta - Spicy Sheep's Milk Yogart
Squash Pakora
Northern Woods Mushroom crepe - Birch Balsamic Glaze, Scallions and
Zucchini Fritter - Fennel Pollend Aioli
-all were great, the Squash Pakora was my favourite.
 
2)First Course
Had the Victory Greens Salad: Niagara Apple, Watermelon Radish, Pepita Seeds, Maple Vinaigrette - really fresh.
 
3)Second Course
Seared Digby Bay Scallops - Crispy Pork Belly, Pickled Fennel, Anise Caramel
(Loved this)

4)Main Course (Third Course) 
Wellington County Tenderloin - Cellar Salad, Mashed Yukon Golds, House Jus
(Absolutely well made)
 
5)Dessert (Last Course) 
Chocolate Brownie - Whiskey Carmel, Chantilly


---overall my food was amazing - the Wellington County tenderloin was perfectly done, I would definitely return - as I know what I'd be getting. Also, all comments on the ambiance are spot on, the place is well decorated and the staff are friendly, polite and attentive.


Overall, a very positive experience. Great food, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Wow. 
Ordered a burger. Took a few bites out of it. It was raw. Sent it back. The same burger i had chewed up arrived back on my plate disguised in a new bun. Absolutely unsanitary and revolting for a restaurant to do that!
The food was inedible. 
cauliflower deep fried and doused in barbecue sauce was given a fancy name on the menu to sound intriguing. 
IT WAS INEDIBLE! 

EWWWWW"}
{"text":"Everytime i've visited Globe - i've been impressed. For me it falls under the high value category. Reasonable prices for great food, very attentive service and good ambience. 

What i also really love about the place is it's equally good for a date, or for a large party. The way the restaurant is designed, there's a lot of versatility (similar to the old Boiler House) which makes it well equipped for all kinds of party sizes - without loosing out on service and food.

As a tip - the patio space upstairs is quite nice for a private event. 

This is my go to spot for a no surprise-please everyone-reliable meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far one of my favourite restaurants of all time. It is expensive but the price is worth it. A relaxing but not pretentious atmosphere with dim lighting, accompanied by excellent food, with bursting flavours and high end service makes this place a comfort and a perfect date night dinner experience. Whether you're sitting in the front of the restaurant looking at the hustle and bustle of The Danforth or sitting in the more romantic mid diningroom, or enjoying the evening sky on the rooftop patio, you won't be disappointed where you sit. My wife and I recently saw a show at the Danforth Music Hall (I'll do a review on that too) and it's a five second walk across the street. Globe is super easy to get too as well, being a couple of mins away from Broadview Subway station. There is also a Green P parking lot close by if you're driving. You must try this place!! I should get paid for writing such a review :)"}
{"text":"We've enjoyed Globe many times since 2009. We originally went for my birthday with friends. We've been both during the week for lunch and dinner and on the weekend for dinner.

The maître d is always professional and courteous. They help with coats, direct you to your table and are happy to answer questions about the menu. In fact, we've run into one maître d in particular at other restaurants on the Danforth and not only have they recognized us but been just as polite outside of their establishment.

The Globe itself is beautiful. It used to be a bowling alley way back in the day and they've left the original hard wood lanes in the rear of the restaurant. The ceilings are high, seating is comfortable and ambience comfortable. 

Meals are started with complimentary bread and usually a small entrée for each person at the table - think something the size of a piece of sushi.

The menu can be different from night to night because the chef shops locally and likes to keep things fresh. We know this because one night after a particularly scrumptious meal we asked to see the chef. He came out and answered all our questions about his preparation style, philosophies, etc.

Soups are delicious at Globe. So flavourful and rich. A constant on the menu is Canada's finest plate which has had everything from meat through vegetable selections when we've gone.

We originally started going to Globe because we wanted to try food that was outside of our comfort zone. One time we had a liquorice leather. It was like a fruit roll-up type consistency but made with liquorice root. Another time we had something more familiar - a rib eye. Regardless of what we've tried we have yet to be less than thrilled with the fare.

I could be wrong but I seem to ever see the same server more than twice. I'm not sure if it's turnover or just when I happen to go. Regardless I've never found the service to be anything less than what I'd expect from a place that serves such yummy food."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular on tonights dinner , oysters were small but fresh. Had the chicken in kimchi sauce, tasted like soicy ketchup. Had the duck poutine special was pretty sweet not enough cheese curds, and had the pork n clams, nothing binds the dish together, i get it chorizo and clams are cool but separately they dont."}
{"text":"Service is Great.  Food is excellent and great nightly specials including Buck a Shuck Oysters from 4-6pm along with great HH drunk specials.  Will be back again"}
{"text":"When Globe Bistro first opened, I really tried to force my self to dislike it as Globe usurped what was once my beloved Cafe Brussels, home of a myriad of mollusk delights. 

 Well I've had the pleasure of visiting Globe several times from its dawning and have ALWAYS been well impressed by its exemplary service, elegant relaxed surroundings and incredible food. 

My first visit was casual as hubby & me were seated upfront close to the bar.  I ordered the Globe hamburger (mmm with smokey ketchup) and was feeling festive so I decided to order a Proseco too...mid way through my meal I had a fruit fly in my Proseco and I swear the bartender had x-ray vision 'cos as soon as he saw me inspecting my glass, dude like nearly jumped the bar to come ask if  there's a bug in it and if I wanted my Proseco replaced, which he did and then did not charge me for it which I thought was pretty awesome on their part.

Second visit was to eat on the roof-top patio and had a magnificently yummy cobb salad, very impressed with the slick patio set-up, arguably one of the best in the city.

Third visit was for Winterlicious diner 2010. This time hubby and myself dined intimately on  the top floor overllooking patrons and murals of nude silhouttes while basking in the deliciousness of the Cornmeal Crusted Lake Huron Whitefish with prawn \"gumbo\" sauce , plus Cauliflower Moussaka  with Ontario buffalo mozzarella and to finish a Walnut Butter Tart Vanilla Chantilly, Muskoka cranberry preserve. All this amazing-ness for $35! Holy Hannah!!

  I love and also appreciate that Globe's menu incorporates local and seasonal items so it is everchanging and supporting the local economy.

Well Globe  I tried to dislike you but... you're good enough, you're smart  enough and gosh darnitt, I just like you!"}
{"text":"We recently went to Globe Bistro with another foodie couple. We all arrived for our early reservation separately and the first few  to arrive ordered cocktails at the bar when the whole party was assembled and our table on the mezzanine was ready they offered to carry our drinks for us, nice touch. 

During Winterlicious Globe has reduced their ala carte menu, fine for us as we planned for Winterlicious but some may be surprised by this. 

We ordered our prix fixe selections as well as an extra appetizer course. Three of us had the scallop app, it consisted of three medium sized scallops which were perfectly cooked and the sauce and lardons with it were a perfect complement to the sweetness of the scallop. Then the extra app of pork belly which was very good, I didn't care for the sauce on this dish which can stand on it's own but the other diners enjoyed it. For mains we had the braised short ribs which were perfect, and duck which was a touch overcooked. We had two bottles of wine suggested by the sommelier an Australian Temprinillo which was excellent and an Argentine Malbec which was less successful but still good. 

On to dessert the apple tart was a disappointment, it was served fridge cold which really ruined it, hardening the pastry the toffee pudding on the other hand was super. 

Service was excellent, there was one small problem, immediately recognized, corrected and compensated for, we lingered a bit at the table taking nearly 2 1/2 hours but never felt the slightest pressure, especially during winterlicious they must have planned to turn that table quicker but never let on to us.

So for 4 winterlicious menus plus 2 extra apps, 4 cocktails, 2 bottles of wine plus a glass and corkage on a dessert wine we brought from our cellar (yes we were walking or rather staggering home) the bill came to just over $400 tip included, a bit steep for winterlicious but we did load on the booze, I thought this was good value."}
{"text":"Globe bistro was my only 2015 summerlicious destination and I was moderately satisfied. For the $35 price tag, I really didn't think that it was worth the bill. I paid $35 to fill 45% of my stomach. The $/% ratio was really off. 

I had the pig tail croquette, the seared wellington county steak, and the summer peach melba. The pig ear was a pleasant appetizer; the texture and flavour of the ear was fantastic and the sesame and sauce that came with it was delicious. 

The steak filled 1% of the plate and 5% of my stomach. I literally asked them to throw it on the grill, flip it over, and give it back to me but it ended up arriving medium. The meat tasted average but I could taste the potential of what could have been had it been rare - which only added to the frustration. 

The dessert was definitely the highlight but I'm a bit of a sucker for sorbets. Its a refreshing dessert and was a bang to cap off an average experience. The blend of peach, raspberry, and crunchy meringue is a thing of beauty. 

I'll visit outside of summerlicious to see what the hype is about but until then, this would probably not be my first choice."}
{"text":"Came here for Easter brunch and it was amazing! We have a gluten allergy (not a life choice!) and they were very accommodating. Rainbow trout is delish and the Wellington rib eye is sublime. Service is on point, Jake was our server and he took excellent care of us. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Lets start with what was exceptional.....the service. Our server Jake was wonderful. Not over bearing, professional, and exeuded a desire to make our expirience above reproach. 

The food. Very well executed. The steak was cooked to perfection. The yukon gold frites were surprisingly good for frites, and the smokey house made ketchup was orgasmic. 

The wine list needs some works, but you get what you pay for. 

Lastly, the ambiance is warm and inviting. The high ceilings create a warm buzz of other peoples conversations, which is quaint. The colours and decor are classy and un obtrusive.

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I got confused easily, and I was trying to make a reservation through Open table for Sunday Brunch, I accidentally booked a table at Globe Earth instead. 

And when I arrived, of course there was no reservation under my name and they were full booked! Since I am meeting a fellow Yelper here for brunch and no way I am leaving so I was offered to sit at the bar. Then after 15 minute or so I was offered a table at the back of the restaurant.

To be honest I like Globe Earth a lot better! From the staffs, the setting, the food! If I going for brunch I don't think I will be back at Globe Bistro. The dining room here though is classy and nice but I found it a little dim, a little impersonal and a little pretentious.

My Brunch mate was nice enough to offer share with me:

Egg Benny Yelper's Way with White Fish ($13)

Omelette of the Day ($12) with King Mushroom and Goat Cheese

Both nicely done, but did not wow me....

Sitting at the back of the room has it's disadvantages as getting our waitress to refill our water glass and coffee proved not a easy task!"}
{"text":"\"Meh\"

That's the exact word I would use to describe my experience at Globe Bistro.  It really pains me to say this because I have been itching to indulge in what they call a \"unique local food experience\" for months.  But that experience fell short relative to my high expectations.  The local aspect is what landed Globe a spot on my hit list.  I just hoped that it would come with the whole package.

We took advantage of the Groupon deal ($69 for a 5-course tasting menu for two) but oddly I still felt as though I was ripped off.   It was partly because of the \"big plate/small portion\" syndrome, all while being short on flavour.   A formula that doesn't produce lasting impressions when I'm at the table.

The Service: meh. 

It started off on the right foot when I called to reserve and request a paleo-friendly meal.  They were graciously willing to accommodate and I thank them for that.

It was once we were situated at our cozy table that the service faltered.   Our main server just didn't deliver on the high-end experience.  She was dismissive and looked as though it was a struggle to smile.  I think her name was \"Debbie Downer\".

On a positive note, the sequencing and timing was perfect: with less than 5 minutes between each course, and glasses proactively topped up.  (Although, it was 10pm and we were one of three tables left, which may have worked in our favour).

Our Order:  meh

Two of us took advantage of the Groupon, and my sister-in-law went with the a la carte menu.  Remember, all of my meals were tweaked to exclude dairy, grains and gluten so it's not fair for me to judge.  Nor is it fair to the chef, who has to deliver his vision while forced to omit key ingredients.   That's why I relied on the opinions of my company...and their response was a unanimous \"meh\".  Then again, service is a huge part of the experience. So when the service is \"meh\", the meal is \"meh\".

Starter:  Maple Salt Cured Rainbow Trout ($11) - my sister-in-law and I shared this appetizer to hold us over until our cousin arrived.  Smoked salmon and the like are hard to screw up, and Globe's version was tasty as expected.  The contrasting flavours of the sweet cranberries next the the salty trout were a nice touch.  I would have just liked to see more trout :)

5-Course Tasting Menu:

1. Soup - Northern woods mushroom purée, sherry, truffle cream,red fife croutons

On a blistering cold winter day, this is exactly how I would have liked the meal to start - with a warm, creamy and cozy soup.  I'm a mushroom fanatic so this had my taste buds singing, even without the cream and croutons which were omitted per my Paleo diet restrictions.  

 2. Salad - Salt roasted celeriac, tobacco poached pear, celeryhearts, maple creme fraiche, sherry foie gras vinaigrette

The only wow factor here was the presentation.  With or without the dressing, the consensus was that this salad left much to be desired.  The components were interesting and unique, but they didn't come together to leave an impression.  As one of the girls put it: \"this is the lamest salad I've ever had\".

3. Fish - Smoked haddock croquette, espellete aoli, pea shoot salad

My food envy kicked in as soon as I saw this land across the table.  The girls were beaming with delight at their first bite.  It was quite painful to watch.

Paleo version: Rainbow trout - While the girls continued to fight for the mini croquette on massive plate, I tried to enjoy my tiny Paleo friendly fish course.  I'm sure it was wonderful, but I was too distracted by the commotion across the table.

4. Main - Bradford bay chicken supreme, roasted cauliflower, blackmquinoa, walnut purée, coriander lemon cumin jus

Below is the non-Paleo version with quinoa.  I had a chance to sample the roasted cauliflower (which as you know, I am a fan of) but the chicken itself was...how do I put this...\"meh\".  The flavour could have been more impressive perhaps.  I'm not a chef, so I really have no idea what I'm talking about.  As a consumer and a foodie though, I can say that I've had better chicken.  Sorry Globe.

Paleo version:  Chicken with broccoli.  I was pleased to see my chicken on a pile of bright green broccoli (it made up for the salad which had little substance).  I understand the chef had limitations, but I would still expect to see something a little more interesting and unique.  In fact, my dinners at home don't look much different from this.

Out of space!  More on my blog:)"}
{"text":"Innovative, fun menu.

Beautiful decor and layout.

Great service."}
{"text":"The interior design is modern and clean. Once you enter, you can see the open kitchen concept which is pretty cool to see. Nothing is hidden. Across from it, are two washrooms which provide towels to dry instead of paper towel. 

They were nice to accommodate 10 people with one table as initially over rsvp, they told me it would be 2 tables side by side. They have 3 floors (I believe), which some area is for private functions. 

Winterlicious: we were there for lunch. 3 course meal for $23 (taxes). 

The food came all together which was nice to see. The service was great. 

Happy:  Overall, my friends were happy about what they ordered and we were all talking about the presentations of the food/dish. My appetizer was the initial talk as it was put to the side of the plate (see photo) which was a different take for me. There weren't enough Brussels sprouts compared to the cauliflower. For my main dish, I had rainbow trout which my 2 pieces were smaller than other friends who ordered the same dish. So indeed, it wasn't consistent. The butternut squash was hidden under some type of grains. As for dessert, it was sweet and good. The creme caramel could have been softer. 

Not happy:  Overall, it was decent, but somehow I wasn't totally full or satisfied. I could eat more - for a girl!! 

Verdict: The atmosphere is nice. The food is elegantly displayed. So indeed, it can be romantic. I would love to go back for brunch or a special occasion. I like how they use local ingredients and that their food/dishes are not the typical ones that you get out there."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious with my parents. Their Winterlicious menu had a lot of options compared to other restaurants. I had the lentil puree, lamb shoulder and chocolate custard. The portions were good and very filling. The desserts were too sweet. 

Overall, good meal and dining experience for $20 per person."}
{"text":"I went to Globe Bistro for Thanksgiving prix fixe dinner last year. I was blown away with food and the impeccable service! The turkey was the best that I've ever tasted, and everything, including the amuse bouche and desserts, were just delectable. I look forward to returning to Globe Bistro soon!"}
{"text":"Booked this as a promo through Ticketmaster  with concert tix @ Danforth Music Hall. Not the greatest experience, wait staff was clueless and gave us a fixed menu which was pretty gross, opted to dine from the reg menu instead which was just ok. Seating was by the door, cold drafts, noisy from seating intake and the bar, waitress was inattentive, hardly checked on us throughout the meal. Would not book through Ticketmaster or the concert venue again, would prob not go back on my own either, would def not recommend to friends/family. Barely a 2/5, and only because the company was good and the concert was so great it made up for the crappy meal and poor service."}
