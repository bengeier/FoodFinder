{"text":"WOW!  I need to go back to this area just so I could finish drinking their entire menu day by day.  It is filling, healthy, and beyond delicious.         It isssssss addicting.  I took a picture of their ingredient list because I have never seen any place like this.  Yes, Pinterest may have similar shakes, but have you tried Pinterest.  PSH.  It's a joke.  The only thing that is similar between the Pinterest Protein shakes and Healthy Shake Shack's protein shakes is the name.  The stellar employees here make these shakes come out good.         Speaking of the employees, there was such a dope female worker as well as a few other employees too.         On point.       Connected to sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Unfortunate that yelp even makes you give a one star. Save your time and burn 12 dollars instead."}
{"text":"It tasts like chalk... The idea is great but, whoever owns this place needs to go back to the drawing board.  I added vanilla flavored stevia to mine and that helped but, not enough."}
{"text":"This is place is AMAZING. Their shakes are almost addictively delicious! I come a few times a month. Indulgent yet healthy, it's a MUST. (The Lemon one is amaaaazing seriously)  Key Note: its pretty much inside the deli shop - there's no separate door for it."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with my smoothie! Had mixed berry and literally only tasted like protein powder. Figured I could still drink it down. Nope. It's that bad."}
{"text":"This is connected to Capriotti's. It's not a stand alone shop. The taste of the shakes was chalky and watery. We asked if it was Herbalife, he said he didn't know. The service was very slow. Took 30 minutes to get 5 shakes. The guy that helped us was nice but there are plenty of other \"healthy\" shakes elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went there for a mid work shake and it was closed. The hours read they were open until 6 but the guy there said that because they were short staffed they closed at 2. Big bummer as I went out of my way to try it and you figure that if they have such a prime location in the heart of old town that they would stay true to their hours. Eager to try this out as this seems to be targeted towards the health conscious. Also, I was unable to find any prices for these shapes online so the addition of that information could also be very helpful."}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe I'm the first to post a review for this place. All the shacks sounds delish. One of the owners Michael, recommended the V8 Splash with organic spinach, berries, tomatoes and 24g protein. It came out brown, didn't look great BUT tastes just like the V8 Splash itself just in a smoothie form. Happy, clean, and friendly service. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Can you say... YUCK!? Cause those are the words you will utter if you get a shake from there.  The Staff was nice though."}
{"text":"Went in to get a breakfast shake. They said they were short staffed. I asked where there might be another place to get a breakfast shake. They said they didn't know. #fail"}
{"text":"Stopped by at 8:10am on Wednesday If you are not open by 7/8am you will not see my business. Off to chop shop!"}
{"text":"At 250 calories and 24 grams of Protein. It is perfect, but expensive! $6.74 for a small container that didn't fill up the top.  Not sure how healthy they are since ingredients were not on the menu board. I was headed to my gym for an intensive fitness training and was in dire need of protein, so I popped in here for a healthy shake.  The shake was good, but I wish I knew the sugar content.  This shop is tiny, so there is no sitting area. It's connected to Capriotti's Sandwich Shop.  I wasn't sure if I was allowed to sit there, so I consumed my lovely drink inside my car."}
{"text":"This place is great! The owner and staff are very friendly and really offer a great smoothie. I was amazed by how great the smoothie tasted with all the fun flavors and how healthy it was for you. All under 250 cals... WOW!!!! Great spot conveniently located near the cappriottis another favorite of mine! I highly suggest going there for a great, healthy, meal!"}
{"text":"Super yummy decadent flavors. Staff is very nice. A must for a shake without the guilt!"}
