{"text":"I happened upon this place totally by mistake, and I was super impressed. 

The coffee was great. The atmosphere was lovely. The location is close to my place which is amazing 

All in all it was just a really nice
Place to spend an hour doing some reading :P"}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and have dropped in three times.
Each time I felt as if I was intruding on the server's free time (I believe it was the \"big guy\"). He continued his chat with another customer for about three minutes before slowly sauntering over to get my order and make my coffee. Once is an anomaly, but three times is a trend.
My impression is this: if you're a regular, you probably love this place. If you're not, you won't feel welcome.
The coffee was good."}
{"text":"This is the original shop of this two-store chain. Unlike it's Parkdale sister, there is a good home-made food selection.  Another off-beat kind of place, near 5th Street and Lake Shore Blvd in Toronto's west-end. The place is comfy, with an eclectic mix of furniture in the main sitting area, great for relaxing with a book, or talking to a friend in a relaxed atmosphere. Their drip coffee is excellent, and their Amercano ain't bad. Don't expect barista-style perfection on other coffee products, but I go here for the drip coffee when I'm this far from the beaten path.
Food is homemade, and of the sandwich variety, but I did thoroughly enjoy my ham and cheese sandwich.
In the suburban cement jungle that is Etobicoke-Lakeshore, The Big Guy's Little Coffee Shop is an oasis for coffee lovers who think Tim's tastes like instant freeze-dried coffee, or who think Starbucks coffee is just burnt. My dark roast coffee was just right, here."}
{"text":"A 'go to' for me on weekends when I can't be bothered making coffee...very cute and quaint little place showcasing local artists."}
{"text":"What a hidden treasure this shop is! Their coffee is phenomenal - freshly roasted, dark and strong. Friendly atmosphere. Unfortunately not in my neighbourhood, but a treat when I'm in their neck of the woods."}
{"text":"Nice little independent, neighbourhood coffee shop with a good vibe.  The owner IS a big guy!  ;-)

Organic and fair trade coffee is available."}
{"text":"The one time I went there, it was like taking my order and making my latte was a major and inconvenient interuption to the server's day. It seems the last thing this person wanted to do was serve me.

Felt unwelcome. Haven't been back."}
{"text":"This area is relatively devoid of coffee shops compared to downtown but I popped in after seeing some good Yelp reviews. They really hit the mark. It's a super cute spot with good service and a stellar Americano. Will definitely come back here when I'm in the neighbourhood again."}
{"text":"Amazing little coffee shop you could drive or walk by and not even notice that it's there, lots of regulars and awesome staff if your ever in the area I would totally recommend dropping in for a coffee"}
{"text":"Do you enjoy local coffee shops where you find locals sitting around enjoying their cup of brew?  If yes - this is the place to be.
The owner and his friends play Magic (i think thats what its called), others are reading, or playing checkers/chess.

I always order an americano - and get a large one for the same price as a coffee.
If you're looking for a starbucks (snobby) feel - this is not your place."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot.  Lots of regulars and locals.  Would love later hours...  terrific coffee."}
{"text":"Quaint. The \"big guy\" has a certain character that gives this place charm. It's a small personal business, but there's something unique about coming to this place. 

Needs to get the sugar/milk section cleaned up. Felt it's been consistently messy and chaotic."}
{"text":"Wonderful people. Cute apothecary next door. Ideal place for a calm relaxing cup of coffee. :)"}
{"text":"We visited around 10:15 AM on a Saturday morning. Street parking was $1.00 per hour when we visited. Don't expect the best service - you'll be lucky if you get more than a grunt. It's a smaller, rustic-looking space with what looks like a local following. 

As for the coffee, in short, if you like bold, deeper roasts, check this place out. If you like medium, lighter roasts with a more laid-back feel, this probably won't be your go-to. I ordered a small latte which came to a total of approximately $3.75, give or take a few cents. I'm indifferent to bolder roasts, with a preference leaning towards medium brews. And to be honest, this latte fell a little too bitter, flat, and deep for me. But then again, bolder roasts aren't normally for me. If you're into that, this may be worth checking out. Otherwise, pass."}
{"text":"Good for the lakeshore.. A little unkept and lacks som coffees/hospitality"}
{"text":"Nice informal place. The owner remembers my usual drink. The lids/cream/sugar station is a little messy and could be spruced up. Otherwise great coffee"}
{"text":"Better coffees and lattes than Starbucks (and I am a Starbucks junkie) and better prices than Starbucks too. They even carry almond milk!
It can be a little too loud at times to read with the owner's cute kid and his little friends, but overall, a great friendly atmosphere."}
