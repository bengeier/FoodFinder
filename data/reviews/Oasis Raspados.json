{"text":"The Raspados are so dang good, my wife and I are pretty much addicted. The guy was very helpful as they have a lot of real fruit choices to pick from. Great value as well. 

Better than just ice cream like the other reviewer mentioned."}
{"text":"love everything about this place, the food and the service are great! my favorites are the chamoyadas and the tostitos."}
{"text":"Glad not to have to drive too far out of Scottsdale for authentic Mexican shaved ice treats. The Chamoyada reminds me of a Bloody Mary on ice - salty, spicy and sweet! Perfect way to cool down on a hot day."}
{"text":"Raspados are Mexican Snow Cones. With that said, this is a great place for that. They combine snow cones with ice cream, flavorings, fruits, etc. It's really good and for $2 you get a good sized cup. They also serve other mexican treats like \"churros locos\" and such, but we didn't try them. They also let me know that during the winter they serve fresh corn \"estilo mexicano\", which is with mayonnaise, Parmesan cheese, lemon and chili.
Very good place to try, like a Mexican \"Baskin Robbins\"."}
{"text":"First time I've tried a raspado.  Attendant was super friendly and nice enough to provide me with a sizable sample.   Too sugary for me right now, but I could see as a great summer treat if they sold in a miniature size."}
{"text":"This place is more than just good it is of high quality! I've been to other Raspado businesses and their fruit seems old which makes the fruit juice thick and disgusting. This place however always seems to have the freshest fruit and delicious thirst quenching juice, especially on a hot summer day! 

Highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it!"}
{"text":"Raspados are so good, I come here a lot when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Enjoying my strawberry raspados right now, and it's 105 degrees out. Great way to cool down, but the staff wasn't super helpful with the all-Spanish menu."}
{"text":"I've been craving these for so long and I finally got some here, I got a small chamoyada and it was more than enough so I shared it. Perfect treat on a hot day. Sweet, spicy, delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Delicious, refreshing, and very reasonably priced! I try to drop by Paradise Mexican Restaurant at Arizona Mills whenever I go there, but the lines tend to be very long, seating is limited, and the prices are a little high. The raspado here is just as good, and cheaper too. I also did not feel rushed when \"building\" the raspado to my taste, and found the staff to be very friendly. The menu is on the smaller side, but  there are plenty of ways to customize your sweet treat. Had my scoop of vanilla ice cream been just a tad bigger,  and had there been more English translation/assistance for those not familiar with this fantastic dessert, I would've rated this business at 5 stars...but I'm a fan nonetheless."}
{"text":"love this place , best snack stop in ne phx , I will take a mangoneada over starbucks any time."}
{"text":"When you are missing Mexico this is the place to hit up. Although the treats are not as good as the ones you would find in the state of Michoacan they are still good. I've tried basically everything on their menu, you can't go wrong with this place. So next time it gets 100 degrees and you want a little piece of Mexico, you know where to go!"}
{"text":"This is CLOSED per note by the landlord.  FYI.  Go find the other location.  Still great drinks."}
{"text":"Its basically fruit slushies and ice cream, prices are ok, but the flavors are really watered down. Over all, wasn't impressed in the times I've gone."}
{"text":"The raspados are soooo good!!! My kids loved them and they are better than ice cream so we WILL be back for more."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS NOW CALLED \"Raspados, El Boly\".
Clean, bright, and flavorful
I really like it, and the food is great.
Pretty much Mexican slushy's and bags of chips that have all sorts of things inside
Very customization
Luckily I know Spanish, but I'm not sure how well the employees speak English
REALLY wish I could bring the stuff they sell here to the movies, that would be awesome!
The only downside is that there really isn't much for picky eaters that don't like fruits/vegetables etc. (my friends)
Also its inconveniently in front of a lot of road construction.
Once the construction gets fixed and"}
{"text":"They have Thrifty Ice Cream.  Those of us who aren't 'old' yet but still remember it know ho good that ice cream is.  My daughter said they had the best vanilla ice cream she's ever had. Not to mention all the other goodies there.  You'll leave a very happy customer."}
{"text":"found them by chance.  I was in the stripmall for another business and saw their signs. popped in and the place was busy!  lots of families, all seated enjoying treats I've never heard of before.   Tositos Preparados, Churros Locos, and some other things.    I tried their sonoran hot dogs as I've not had one in a couple years and they were excellent.  now that the summer heat's here and they're close by i'll be sure to try a raspado.  the melon and peaches and all the fruits looked so delicious and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Great place situated in plaza to enjoy childhood favorites such as chamoyada and elote cups! Very yummy and also they carry thrifty ice cream. Place is a little warm
