{"text":"NO MORE FROWNIE?! Frownie was why I went to King's! Guess I won't go to King's anymore :("}
{"text":"I have so many great memories from childhood about King's. The good memories were wiped out by a recent trip. Waitress was sweet as can be and working hard. However, the changed menu was awful and the food was hardly edible. We didn't bother to complain since we noticed other customers had already done so. If they still sold Frownie Brownies, our frowns would have been just as clear. Which reminds me why would a restaurant stop selling such a popular item???? Mistake."}
{"text":"Good service but the last 2 times we've gone there have been hairs in my son's kids meal.. A bit disappointing."}
{"text":"First I have to say that if you're not a KINGS Family Restaurants REWARDS MEMBER, take those five small minutes to sign up!! This place offers deals for member all the time!  King's food is delicious, and not to mention the customer service is always TOP OF THE LINE!! They are a friendly, and fun staff!! PLUS A BANGING SELECTION OF DESSERTS  Stop through and I bet you will love it!!"}
{"text":"So... I'd really like to support Kings, but unfortunately it's on its last leg. It use to be a decent resturant. Throughout the years they have been going very much downhill, but ever since new ownership they have finally reached their lowest. Worst service I have ever had in my life. I was a server for a few years elsewhere, so I can understand a few mistakes now and then, but these were inexcusable mistakes. Almost 45 minutes after we gave our waitress our pretty simple order, we found out she forgot to put our food in. The manager did nothing to help. Nothing was comped off our bill. The food still took an additional 20 minutes to arrive, and the order was a bit messed up. I would be able to see past the service we were given if the manager cared about their customers even a little bit, but the manager didn't even visit our table once or do anything about it. I would strongly recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"The place is clean and food was good. We came with three adults and two children. We had to wait over a half hour for the food to come though and that was not pleasant. They did not bring any of our requests -- pickles on a sandwich, bottle of hot sauce, peppers on cheese steak sandwich. The last one especially bothered me because it would have taken too long to fix, and they did not seem to care. Maybe too busy, but restaurant was not crowded. I feel like most places would have taken it off the bill. We had intended to get ice cream as a treat, but went to Gibby's instead. Overall, a very poor experience for our family."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast with some family members. The first thing that struck me is that the restaurant is somewhat dated and dingy. I saw a worker \"cleaning\" a booth with a dirty rag and was sort of horrified when her rag kicked up some dirt between the seats, which she then just left sitting on the seat. :/  My meal was so-so. Eggs poured out of a carton, potato pancakes that came out as two oddly-shaped and uncrispy lumps, an off-brand English muffin, and some overpriced o.j.  My husband said that his pancakes were delicious and he declared them better than Eat & Park, but for myself, I've definitely had better meals at Eat & Park.  I just don't know. The food seemed sort of overpriced, too. $32 for three people eating some pretty low-quality, carb-heavy breakfast fare.  I've heard that dessert here is pretty good, but I won't exactly be hurrying back to find out."}
{"text":"Kings restaurant in homar served me a Meatloaf and mashed dinner I would not  feed to my cat. Upon returning to our hotel we met another customer from the restaurant who said they sent back a cold hamburger. These guys need to hire some cooks and a new manager. Yuck"}
{"text":"An excellent place for ice cream. Anyone who thinks King's food (other than ice cream) is good, must hate food. The atmosphere is a typical cheap diner (which isn't a bad thing). I would describe the staff as hardworking and stressed out but generally some nice people."}
{"text":"Dined in recently with my 3 year old. He had to use restroom after our food arrived and we left the table for about 2 minutes. I came back and the server was going through my phone. I guess instead of assuming I took my young child with me to the bathroom she thought we walked on the check and left all of our stuff sitting there. A good idea for her would to actually be present in her section that was right in front of the kitchen, doing check backs etc so you can see what is going on with your guests. We also ordered breaded chicken tenders and instead of her telling us they were out she served us some pieces of cut up fried chicken breast that tasted terrible. I would have changed our order if we had been alerted that we weren't receiving what we asked for. I'll stick with the Kings in Monroeville"}
{"text":"This place offers homestyle cooking. I've had everything from breakfast to lunch to dinner items. I have never had a bad meal here. The waitstaff is very freindly. The portions are more than generous. The eating area is clean also unlike some other restaurants."}
{"text":"Was recently at Kings twice. Both times the service was horrible!  First time I sat down and had to wait ten minutes for a waitresses for service. Finally a waitress saw me sitting there. It was her first day and I was not in her section but she attempted to get me coffee. Then the older waitress who ignored me for ten minutes screamed at her and said she would take care of me.  But she continued to talk to someone at the counter. It took 30 minutes to get eggs and coffee.  Service the second was just as bad. Waited 30 minutes for a Reuben. They forgot the fries.  I stood at the entry to the Dining area waiting to be seated(it was empty in there) for 5 minutes as management and staff walked past me.  Get your staff including management trained in customer service.  I could not believe how rude the staff was to the new waitress. It appears that if you are not a regular daily counter customer they are not interested in serving you."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for breakfast with young children.  Did not get served until we complained.  Their reason was that we had a large party in front of us. They didn't say it would take long when we were seated.  Waitress very unfriendly after we complained to management. Food was average.  I will not go back."}
{"text":"I went to Kings with my kids on 10/17.  Nothing has changed except the prices.  The atmosphere is still old and outdated.   The staff is still very slow and inattentive.   Our server sat us  gave us water and then left us for 15 min.  He said \"sorry we are really busy\". There were many empty tables.  My kids and I were just getting ready to leave.  We should have.   Heard from management on my cell phone.  He apologized for the poor service.  That was it.  My family and I will never return to Kings.  New management?  Same Old restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was not that great and service matched. Kids mac and cheese had funny taste... Not bad just different like a smoky sweet cheddar. Scrambled eggs were dry and had unappealing texture. Also the server forgot my soup even after a reminder. Salads were large and good though (grilled and buff chicken). Thats the main reason they get the 2nd star. Its pretty hard to mess up salad though. I ll be goin to eatn park from now on. Shoulda never changed it up today."}
{"text":"Prices are outrageous now... My food had very little mass to it.. Dr Pepper might as well have been water. Ancient  tvs with bad picture quality and ugly mounts.. Really dirty.. Dust everywhere. Took forever to get out check and pay."}
{"text":"Only gave this place 1 star because I have to. Horrible service!! We waited almost 30 min before drinks were ordered and they took another 20 min to get there. The order was taken by the assistant manager that looked as though he had never waited tables before. The only reason we stayed as long as we did is bc it was after a funeral visitation it was late and we had children that needed to eat. There were 11 of us and he took a couple of drink orders at a time. Some people ordered ice cream and then we're told 20 minutes later that they were out. We ended up leaving without apologies or acknowledgment that they had screwed up."}
{"text":"I used to love this King's growing up. They've since gone downhill. We order take-out all the time and have repeatedly gotten soggy food and food with the melted plastic container on it. More than once they've given us completely wrong food. And as of recent, my lady acquired food poisoning from their undercooked breakfast food. I would've given 0 stars."}
{"text":"Service was terrible, slow and disinterested, just like the manager.  We waited for 5 minutes before someone even recognized us standing at the front.  The waitress was nice when she first came to the table.  We waited for over 30 minutes to get out food(a part of 5) and they weren't that busy.  The waitress didn't return until we were almost done eating.  The food was cold and not very tasty.  1 star is being nice."}
{"text":"Just wanted to leave a quick review of appreciation for the customer service and staff at the Carnegie/Heidelberg location.   I ordered soup and salad to go and there were a few things wrong with the order that I didn't discover until I was home. The wrong soup was on the order and the salad was missing fries. Not a huge deal, but I live far enough away that I couldn't go back that night.   An employee named Ben answered the phone and was so friendly and understanding and really went above and beyond. He offered to replace the food and seemed genuinely sorry and concerned about the problem.   I went back today and had the meal replaced and the general manager got the gift card that Ben had set aside for me and took care of everything. Not only was the order perfect, but it was one of the best to-go meals I've had from King's in the 15+ years I've been visiting. Even the cashier who helped me was super friendly and helpful.   Just an all around good experience. This is how customer service should be done!"}
{"text":"So... back in the late 90s, there used to be this super-kick-ass cinnamon ice cream, like an apple pie ice cream without the apples or the pie crust.  SO DELICIOUS!  However, NOW there is some shit-tastic replacement that tastes like vanilla ice cream with last year's red-hot in the middle: totally gross.  Fortunately, our server was nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample, so I only had to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also having to pay for it.  The portions are big and filling, just don't come for the ice cream."}
{"text":"I like  fish sandwichs. I had not been to King's in a while and was attending the car cruise.  The people were friendly and the fish was very good.  I would go back again."}
{"text":"Great food and service at this location! Kathy is a great manager! Ordered a burger and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Favorite spot for a burger and a shake!! Also their breakfast is great! Soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Great American dinner food! Had the Reuben sandwich and my mother had a breakfast that included potato pancakes with eggs, sausage, and toast. It was very reasonably priced (about $6-8 a meal). Service was great! Was a little confused when we first entered because we waited at a register for our table and were supposed to walk around the side of the counter to be seated. Nothing clearly said that. Other then that we had a great meal!"}
{"text":"This was really a 2.5 but the service was great! The two was for the food. One companion had pierogies that were okay but served with applesauce that tasted like the can they came from.  My other friend got a cheeseburger quesadilla that he said was barely edible. I got a cheeseburger and found it to no larger than a jr burger from fast food. To boot, it did not taste very fresh and had gristle and bone in it. ewwww. On the other hand, my sweet potato fries were very good!"}
{"text":"This kings is so old, run down and slow. Honestly if you take an extra five minutes to continue driving in either direction of this kings you will find something 10x more worth going to"}
{"text":"Given the Plum location multiple chances, and it's just been pretty awful.  Last time, the waitress spilled water all over my baby, which I understand accidents happen, but she was barely apologetic.  My husband didn't even eat his meatloaf dinner because it was downright gross.   This visit, the people next to me complained of hair in their food, and on my last bite of my omelet,  I saw a hair, which was definitely not mine.    Hash browns were burnt on outside, barely cooked on inside.   Small servings for a high price."}
{"text":"Stopped tonight for dinner.  The weather was bad so the place was not busy.  We had the Tuna Melt and Turkey Club sandwiches.  The food was good, Tortilla soup was hot and tasty.  Service was rushed and nonexistent.  The waitress came over to our table quickly and took our drink order.  She arrived back with our drinks within a minute and asked if we were ready to order.  We advised we need a few minutes.  She came back a few minutes later and took our order.  During the meal she never returned to refill our beverages or asked about our meal.  We wanted dessert, but when she came to the table, we were about to order dessert , she handed us our check.  We did not order dessert, but sat for a few minutes when she came over and started clearing the table without asking us if were finished with our plates which still had food upon them.   This Kings has decent food, but the service is hit or miss depending on the particular server you are assigned when you arrive."}
{"text":"I worked at kings in 80's and haven't eaten there since I quit hope their better now than then!"}
{"text":"Kings Carnegie has become our go-to restaurant for  breakfast.  When you order coffee, you get a cup and an entire Thermos for the table.  The food is tasty & decently priced for what it is.  The entire place is pretty clean for being a busy place.  The staff is friendly and always makes us feel welcome.  Our favorite server is Carol and we try to sit in her section as much as possible. She always greets us with a smile and a sarcastic comment  which melts my heart.  She knows that we are patient and understanding when it's busy, so we Crack the whip when it's not busy."}
{"text":"Ehh. Your typical kings with ehh food and ehh service so they get a lucky 3 stars. Probably more of a 2 star restaurant than 3 but I'm in a giving mood today. We've yet to have stellar or even close to stellar service here. Poor Harley is probably wondering why he sold now as Kings are shutting down faster than most marriages these days."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a King's in YEARS. I sorta wrote them off as I saw a steady decline in their service and quality. Working in Gibsonia, we don't have much variety, so with Max n Erma's closing my co-worker and I needed a new place to try. We saw they had upgraded the outside, so we figured why not try it? I am glad we did!   They do have a totally revamped menu and it really caters to the Pittsburgh market. I really like that they did gear it towards Pittsburgh, its a nice touch! Everything on the menu looked and sounded so good! I had a hard time choosing, but I ended up getting the turkey Rachel sliders that are served on mini pretzel buns. They were totally delicious! I LOVED the pretzel buns and would go back just for that alone.  Only the outside is updated, which looks great but the inside is VERY old looking. It is kinda cool to \"go back in time\" but I think a facelift inside would really help.   Over all I really liked the \"new\" King's and will be back again!"}
{"text":"I love Kings. To be honest, this is my boyfriend and I's breakfast spot on the weekend! It is obviously not a fancy place, and don't expect great decor, but it is a nice little place for a quick bite to eat. We have always had nice, fast service as well.   I used to go to a different Kings all the time when I was a kid, but for a while there Kings lost its way and became not so good. Within the past few years they have rebranded and turned it around to be a great place for breakfast, brunch, and lunch!   For breakfast I always get the country breakfast. Love their sausage gravy! Also always have to add a side of cheesy potatoes. Lunch I will get the club sandwich with soup, the turkey Rachel sliders, or a salad. Their salads are huge and delicious! Really am never disappointed.   Kings is a great place as long as you know and accept Kings for what it is!"}
{"text":"Actually, we will likely never go back.  Even the kids (now 9 and 11 now) FEAR the sickness they felt after eating at this chain about a year ago (Grandad's poop in pants event didn't help either) and scream a big NO when nostalgia interferes with my intellect.  If they want fast, cheap breakfast/brunch/lunch food in an emergency on the road travelling, they will opt for the lesser discomfort intestinally of Eat -n - Park, Perkins, Denny's, or Cracker Barrel.    Locally, for a digestible brunch/breakfast/lunch experience they request Bados, Bobs, Dor-Stop or LuLu's."}
{"text":"It was important to me to remember our server's name, so I recited it as if I were Vampire Bill - \"Jessica.\"    After a raucous night of roller skating at Neville Roller Drome, my 6-person group headed to Kings for some much-needed nutrition to fend off the forthcoming bruises.  We arrived at 10:30 and were welcomed with open arms even though closing time was 11pm.  One of my friends mentioned that she had never been to Kings before, to which the hostess cheerfully replied, \"You're in for a real treat!\"  Seriously - she was right.  I'm not usually a huge fan of the Kings genre; Dennys...Eat 'n Park - I often love them for their quantity, not quality.  This Kings offered both.  In addition to the yummy food (Veggie Burger - no easy feat), it was a super-fancy Kings to boot.  Stylish, welcoming and complete with the best service staff I've seen in any diner.  Thanks Kings.  I'll see you the next time my need for speed mixes with my need for apple pie."}
{"text":"Cool place. Must be good, local police eat here!  Biscuit bowl, cheesy hash browns, fruit bowl. Very tasty and very reasonable!!"}
{"text":"This diner was fantastic! So much food and amazing service! We loved our server Mrs Liz. She was beyond exceptional. The food was the perfection of diner food too. Highly recommend if you know what a real diner at home kinda feel is. And get the Kings cheesy hash browns."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying the most positive pert of my experience is the server, Jennifer was great and has the menu knowledge that all guests need. Food is mediocre at best, and what is puzzling to me is you NEVER see the manager, it's peak lunch time and no manager?? Over 12 people standing at the door and nobody says a word to them at all. Not for certain that I will return if I do it's because of the server. That would be the only reason."}
{"text":"Kings is a reliable restaurant. The staff is friendly and the menu has everything you would expect for a diner. I had the pumpkin pancake breakfast, it was delicious and a great deal for what you pay."}
{"text":"This has been called a eat n park clone.   Well the menu is a while lot larger!   They offer potato pancake eggs Benedict.   But I was here for dinner.     I started with zucchini fries, lightly drained and served with horseradish sauce (similar to what comes with blooming onion)  really good hot!  Not so good cold. I went with sirlion tips and noodles.  Really good flavor, but ask for extra gravy you may need it.   As a side you can substitute soup, I tried chili.   It has a very mild taste, probably too mild, but it has enough meat to make a burger.  It's a decent stop on the way.   There's a lot to go over on menu.  The deserts were really enticing but there was enough food."}
{"text":"Been to Kings about 6 times now. Have not had one bad meal. We love it here. Service has always been great. You want good food at reasonable prices, come here!"}
{"text":"I have not been here for years and they have since remodeled. Initially the service was slow but later with out us saying anything the manager came by and gave us free pack of frownies which were fresh and fantastic. We work in the restaurant industry so I have more bend for things then most. The food was good and the deserts were good as always. The waitress Suzanna was friendly and was concerned that she did not see us right away and apologized. You dont get that much anymore. We had beef noodles and gravy. The beef steak was tender and juicy and tasty, better than you would get at some of their other competitors. The manager was friendly and stopped by twice. Our deserts strawberry shortcake and peanut butter cup sundae was great and generous. I remember coming here when I was in high school and it was good then. I prefer them over eat and park especially for deserts and portions in general."}
{"text":"We always liked Kings, but have never been here. My wife and I with our 2 kids with all of us drinking water wasted about $43 with tip. I ordered what I thought was grilled chicken breast smothered with cheese, mushroom and onions. What I received was a tiny piece nothing like described. I took a bite and it was actually crunchy, it looked done, but was crunchy. Waitress who was very nice said they've Been having trouble with their supplier. Ok, so they brought me meatloaf and to be frank, I'm not sure what it was as it didn't taste like meatloaf at all. Furthermore it seems Kings has new owners that also took away the membership perks and Frownies, but seem to have raised prices and now have terrible food. The unfortunate thing going in was I bought a $50 gift and received $10 in free cards. I have no intention on going to Kings again unless I get eggs as they are hard to ruin. We used to really enjoy Kings but no more, it's a shamed they're ruined a good thing!"}
{"text":"This was my first king's experience and it did not disappoint!!  Everything was delicious. Classic diner food.  Our waitress, who was extremely sweet, suggested we order the soft pretzel rolls. They were SO GOOD!   I had chicken tenders & fries which was delicious. A ton of food for the price.  My friend had breakfast (which I tasted of course) and it was delicious. I was so jealous I didn't get breakfast. The home fries were great and her waffle was perfect! Yum!   The manager made a point to ask us how everything was, as well. Great experience overall, I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh chain restaurant that is similar to Denny's.  Usually you will find a lot of old people here or high school people.  The food is cheap and okay but not great.  They have always been famous for their ice cream there and that was the reason for our visit.  I had the peanut butter fudge sundae and it was huge!  I did not want to eat the whole thing but I could not help myself.  Yum."}
{"text":"I arrived around 10 am on a Saturday morning.  I was greeted by the hostess,who was polite and friendly, and I informed her that I was alone.  She had just arrived, as well, and wasn't exactly sure what was going on yet, so she asked (the manager?) where she should seat me.  After receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  It had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  So, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.  The waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  She was extremely friendly.  I ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while I looked over the menu.  She returned, and took my order.  I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh's own Jenny Lee® Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.  I also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical.  Kings Family Restaurant featured a very friendly staff, great prices, and tasty food.  I am pleased and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I went there to pick up a coconut pie, it's so good. I saw old woman buy their vegetable beef soup to go. It looked really good. So I order the same to go. I am happy that I did, it's very good."}
{"text":"There is only one reason to come to Kings. The Hot Turkey Sandwich. I do like the Vegetable Soup and have taken it out several times. It is a wonderful comfort soup if you're not feeling well, or a nice warm soup in the winter months on a very cold night.  The breakfast food is ok at best, it lacks taste and flavor to me, but the rest of the family enjoy it. The kids always get the pancakes. It is a nice budget family restaurant.  I have been to several of the chain locations, Monroeville is the closest.  I remember how delicious the Cinnamon Ice Cream and Apple Pie used to be. I am not sure what has changed but it is not as good as it used to be. That is a disappointment for sure.  The service has always been friendly and accommodating to families with young kids. However, The food is slow to receive and not always hot or warm. The price is defiantly there, but not sure the quality is. If you go knowing what to expect you can't be overly disappointed."}
{"text":"We have given this plum location several chances. Each and every time a disappointment, either with service, food food or just slow service from staff to kitchen. I have yet to see a manager on duty during the busy rush on a Sunday morning. The people obvious want to come, management and staff don't seem to want to serve. We will not return and will not recommend to family or friends.   This location needs a management t staff that can hire enough staff to handle a busy location, both front of the house and back. What a shame, the food is good."}
{"text":"After 8 years and with new ownership I decided to try Kings again. I had the breaded fish fry dinner with salad, roll, baked potato and slaw. Everything was off. Nothing seemed simple, fresh and healthy. The same food that put the previous generation in their graves - some far too early! King's must enter the 21st century. Redo all the menu and food prep top to bottom."}
{"text":"Really has gone downhill since new ownership took the franchise over. Food quality is terrible and several times my food was over or undercooked. My wife ordered fried shrimp and it was rubbery. When she told the manager he replied \"yeah, we hear that a lot now\" and offered her something different.  When she asked for a grilled cheese sandwich he said he didn't know what it was or if they could make a special order item."}
{"text":"Had an awesome experience! Tina was incredible with her service. Coffee was delicious and our breakfast couldn't have been any better. These guys do it right! Will revisit many times!"}
{"text":"Breakfast Time!  I stopped by the Kings Family Restaurant prior to grocery shopping.    I have never been to a Kings Family Restaurant since moving to Pittsburgh.   There are several local establishments.  This particular location has pretty good food at a great price.   It is similar to a Cracker Barrel and / or Bob Evans.   I ordered something very hearty - Country Fried Steak , Eggs, and Cheesy Potatoes.  The food and coffee were good.    The service was excellent.   I will go back.    Breakfast runs from $5-8.     My breakfast cost me just over $10 - very comparable to Cracker Barrel / Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Had the hat trick with over medium eggs- properly cooked(solid white, liquid yoke) Samantha was great, Gm stopped by to check on us too. Will be back."}
{"text":"Our favorite place to stop for a bite to eat after shopping ...  love the variety of choices!   The servers are always  friendly .  Today Crystal was our server and our food choice was soup, and morning noon and night sandwich.  Salad and chicken Parmesan."}
{"text":"Service was good. Price for what you get Is a little high for what you get. Small plate  extra $1 for onion rings.  No Chile cause it seasonal who ever heard of Chile being seasonal. It's gone downhill no one in the place at 1"}
{"text":"Kings has become our go-to restaurant for Sunday breakfast.  When you order coffee, you get a cup and an entire Thermos for the table.  The food is tasty & decently priced for what it is.  The entire place is pretty clean for being a busy place.  The staff is friendly and always makes us feel welcome.  Our favorite server is Carrie and we try to sit in her section as much as possible. She always greets us with a smile and a story about one of her kids,  which we enjoy.  She knows that we are patient and understanding when it's busy,  so that helps take a brick off her back when it's busy.    Time & time again,  we will go back!"}
{"text":"After not dining at this location for a good couple years, we decided to give it a try again. What a difference!!! Very clean & neat and the food was good! I had the liver & onions (I know! Not a favorite among most people!) with a baked potato and a tossed salad. The liver was cooked perfectly to my liking and was very tasty. Baked potato was delicious and the salad actually had different greens in it, which made it colorful and tasty! My granddaughter chose the Smothered Chicken--she raves about it over and over and declared \"Meemaw, this may be our new favorite place!\" Two large portions of thick chicken breast were covered with cheese and mushrooms. She was pleased with her Mac & cheese side dish and the broccoli looked fresh, buttery and perfectly cooked. My husband had the batter fried fish, fries and coleslaw--he said the fish was \"pretty good, fries were cold and coleslaw was tasty\". Our server was very kind, helpful and courteous. All in all, we had a pleasant dinner. We left with full tummies and plan on stopping in again soon."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?   Went for breakfast with the family.  We walked in and were told to seat ourselves.   Bad move on their part because we walked through an entire eating area and not one table was cleared off so we had to search out an area that was clean (which was in the farthest place in the restaurant).   We sat down and waited and waited and didn't get a menu or even acknowledged.   Lo and behold a family came in after us and was seated by us and immediately given menus.   I finally had to seek out a waitress.   Once again, it was just a waiting game.  Food was Just ok.  I am sorry to say we won't be going back!"}
{"text":"When you want classic diner fare, you can't go wrong with King's.  They have a wide variety of options on their menu.  Everything from comfort food like meatloaf and turkey to club sandwiches and even grilled tilapia.  They have a large selection of sides to go with entree selections as well.  Every time I've been to this location, we were seated quickly and service was efficient with refills on pop and water without being overbearing.   The food was always exactly as I expected, sometimes even better.  I love that I can get a nice turkey dinner any time of year.  Oh, and save room for dessert.  Their ice cream, especially the cinnamon, are fantastic."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  This used to be our favorite Kings to come to because it used to have great service and good food.  Today service was slow and sporadic at best.  Ordered cheeseburger  slides no American cheese asked for cheddar got shredded cheese and it melted off the bun daughter ordered a chicken breast they brought a sandwich sent back waited 20 minutes for a piece of grilled chicken.  We will not becoming back."}
{"text":"We ate here several times while we were visiting friends. The staff was always super nice we were seated quickly and the waitress always chatted us up. They were quick with the refills. They happily answered any questions and were very knowledgeable with their menu. This is the only place I have ever been to that has cinnamon ice cream which is so good. They also are always trying to come up with new menu items. The price is really good. The food was just as we ordered it and very tasty. My only complaint is they are so far from my home."}
{"text":"During my recent visit to Monroeville, I had breakfast at my hotel then down the road at another restaurant. It wasn't until my third day that I discovered Kings. I wish I had found it sooner! Karen was our server in the front section of the restaurant. Being from the south, I'm accustomed to a bit more hospitality than what I had been getting in the Pittsburgh area. Karen made me feel like I was back home. She was so attentive and kind. The breakfast food was amazing. The cinnamon swirl breakfast the first morning and the omelette the next hit the spot. They have some of the best pancakes I've ever had. Comparable to my grandmother's homemade pancakes, which was previously believed to be unattainable. I suggest this Kings location to anyone within driving distance."}
{"text":"The staff is always nice and the breakfast is always delicious. Thanks Justin for taking care of us! Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"We came here late about 11pm on a Friday night after a trip to the casino.  We wanted to find good food that wasn't priced out of the world and that was open at that time. Our waitress was great even though she was running around like a nut and the place was busy for that late of night and she was the only waitress there, even though there was a manager standing there doing nothing. The food was good, the place was clean and atmosphere was comfortable. Next time we go to the casino we weill be back. We aren't from around there or we wiild go more. I just hope shirley is working next time we go."}
{"text":"I heart King's. I've always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in Monaca."}
{"text":"Only because zero stars is not an option. Waited over 30 minutes for breakfast and then it wasn't what we ordered."}
{"text":"I have never seen a restaurant that has a frowning brownie (a.k.a. Frownie) as their icon, mascot, or spokesperson.  King's Family Restaurant has surprised me with this.  I think it might be in direct dialogue with Eat N' Parks smiling cookie -- funny (funny odd, not funny ha-ha).  We were seated rather quickly by the manager.  Very nice people work here, I was happy to find that even though they had closed a section, the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner.  We chatted with the server a little bit -- she was quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal:  Tea Pepsi Open-faced Hot Turkey Sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy Buffalo Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n' cheese  Our drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  She would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  Eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  I went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  It didn't taste bad, but I swear that it is made by Stouffers.  I didn't feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.  I moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  At least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  I contented myself with eating them.    I tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated.  I finished off my dinner and was happy in the end.  No, it wasn't the best food in the world, but the service greatly helped the perception and it didn't taste bad."}
{"text":"Ive pretty much been eating at various Kings' pretty regularly since I was a child when my parents would take my sister and I into the Fox Chapel location often.  Lately me and my girl have been visiting the Heidelburg location. I love the food, it really tastes homemade, much like something a grandmother would make, complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. Prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means.   Service is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any Kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. Seek out this lady.  My experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.  Im in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the Fox Chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.  Any girl I meet has to enjoy Kings or she's out."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese with American and fries with gravy hit the spot. KC the waitress was friendly and funny. Best experience here in a long time."}
{"text":"We go there almost every Sunday after church.  For as crowded as it gets at that time of day, the service has always been prompt, the waitstaff, friendly and the food has been very tasty."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Slow, not attentive to their customers. Servers take your order and disappear. It seems their \"regulars\" at the counter are the only ones who get good service. A very odd place. Not worth it. Go somewhere else. How does this place remain open?"}
{"text":"Was in town for a visit with family. We went for breakfast on our way to the mall. When we walked in, I got the odor of urine. Not sure if it was urine but sure smelled like it. Place was packed so.....   I ordered the Eggs and Corned Beef Hash and my mother got a Belgian waffle. She was happy with her waffle but the portions of my meal were child like. I started to eat, was just ok. Nothing like they advertized they could make. More like canned  corned beef. While eating my toast I found a few bristles from the butter brush on my toast (I took a photo to prove it). Ewww.   I don't think I will go back if I had a choice."}
{"text":"This place used to be great. The burgers were amazing. So much that when I'd come back here to visit family, I'd always make sure to stop at Kings.   But with their new menu, this place has seen the last of me. All the old staples are gone. And the new offerings aren't nearly as good. The burger had no flavor, the fries were soggy. Their ice cream dressers are dull. Not a bit of what made Kings a Pittsburgh institution still exists.   Waitresses are still great, tho. Pity the food is not. Bring back the old menu!! Quit trying to compete with the big chains and do what you did best."}
{"text":"I don't like to write negative reviews, but truth be told, service was sub par. My waitress was very sweet and personable but spread too thin. People seated themselves because there was no hostess or greeter. There were two servers and a cook working, never saw any management. The food was only ok. My chicken fried steak was full of gristle. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here with my mom and grandma for breakfast food around 12:35 we got seated right away... And ordered around 12:40.  Our order didn't come until 1:15....  My water was empty and at the edge of the table for about 20 minutes until our food came and I got a refill.  My mom's eggs were cold and she was afraid to send them back because she didNt want them doing anything to them.  I've been coming here ever since I've been a little kid and I probably won't come here again.   The service and quality has declined.   At least Bob Evans tries!"}
{"text":"Nice friendly place. Missing the frownie but I love the new sliders. Highly recommend the Reuben slider. Also they need to put the raspberry cooler in their menu. Great drink that I only know of because it is still on the kids menu.   The staff are always polite and the wait for food always seems reasonable. The one time they messed up my order (during the change over to the newer menu) they were quick to make it right."}
{"text":"The wait staff was awful!  We were not greeted when we walked in, and had to hover awkwardly until we were told to sit anywhere, despite the \"please wait to be seated\" sign. The waitress,  Alexus, complained to us about her job, then complained loudly about another customer when we went to pay. The food was cold when it got to us, even though my husband's gravy had a skin on top from being under the heat lamp for so long. We didn't get a single refill during the entire meal, and the toast was an greasy it was dripping. Disgusting!  We will not be back."}
{"text":"I had not to be to Kings in 20 years. We went a couple of times, had bad food, and never went back. Then this past week a friend asked if we could meet there for a late lunch. I agreed and went in expecting the worst.  The restaurant was over half full. I was seated quickly. I ordered tea and started checking out the menu. I kept going back to the breakfast options. I just couldn't pass up the biscuits and gravy. It's hard to find good biscuits and gravy in the north.  My plate came and it had a nice size biscuit. It was the proper density to taste light but stand up to the gravy. At the first bite my heart twitterpated. It was the real deal. They were generous with the gravy. It wasn't too peppery and it was the perfect consistency. There were scrambled eggs that came with the breakfast but instead of 2 scrambled eggs it seemed like four. I barely put a dent in them. There was also Bacon. It was cooked nicely. Our server was wonderful. She was super nice.  Twenty years later and King's  is back in rotation. I never thought I would say that. I'm glad I gave it another try. If it's been awhile since you've been I recommend you go."}
{"text":"Staff was nice. Food not so great. And I just ate breakfast. Did this place change hands?  Seems corporate now. Was family owned when I lived here ten years ago. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to eat. I had the beer battered fish and fries that was on point. Liane my waitress was very attentive and such a blessing to have take my order. The manager (Kevin) was making rounds to all the tables making sure everything is as expected! Clean booths and bathrooms as well. Such a homie warm atmosphere. Bring your family and friends and you're sure to have a delicious meal and at a affordable cost...don't forget to ask for Liane!"}
{"text":"Terrible business.  We sat down in the open seating.  We where there about 10 minutes before we where acknowledged.  There where open seats so it wasn't overly crowded.  It took about another 10 minutes for our drinks to come.  We had a horrible time ordering.  It just seemed the waitress was not trained at all and acted like she had no idea what we where talking about.  My food came out completely wrong, not even close to what I ordered.  My daughter had the wrong sides and our third meal had overcooked eggs and cold pancakes.  Too bad.  :(. We will not go back."}
{"text":"I grew up in this place. The portions have gotten smaller while the prices have gone up. Now I take my grandma there for breakfast if I need to move my bowels."}
{"text":"DIRTY. Gordon Ramsey would have a stroke if he saw this place. Have went here twice recently and both times they have messed up my wife's omlete. How do you mess up an omlete? Was so much cheese that it was not edible. Manager apologized and gave us our meals for free. Went on Halloween night and the booths were not cleaned. Waitresses more interested in gabbing and flirting  rather than cleaning their areas. Hartley King would be ashamed. We will drive on by next time to Bob Evans!"}
{"text":"I have read some reviews of Kings giving it a good rating and some giving it a bad rating.  Mine is in the middle because I am not sure which way to go.  We ordered a breakfast sandwich (bacon, egg, and cheese on cinnamon toast) and hash browns as a take-out order for my wife.  The weather was icy, and we were down the street at the Holiday Inn Express.  The meal was ready in time, the service was pleasant at the counter, and the meal was good. So a decent experience so far.  What causes my quandary about the meal?  They left off the bacon, which is a key part of the sandwich.  All else was good, but it missed one ingredient.  We had places to go and so did not go back to deal with the issue.  Next time I will let them know and make sure we have all the parts of the meal.  Perhaps the cook had a brain lapse that morning.  I will try them again based on the majority of the experience."}
{"text":"What horrible customer service. The cash register was not working correctly, and the cashier just kept swiping my card.  I ended up having to use the ATM within the restaurant to pay with cash. The restaurant ended up charging me for my $24 meal SIX TIMES. When I walked back in to discuss the problem with the manager, he shrugged me off, and he told me that once the system goes through at midnight the charges will go away. Not yet true. He did not offer any help whatsoever, and when the cashier went to inform him of the situation, he just started shaking his head and laughing at me. He acted as if I were overreacting that I had been charged so many times."}
{"text":"We had some great food here. When you walk in the place, you are warmly greeted and acknowledged. It's very close to the Hampton Inn. They have some good breakfast items that are fresh and come quickly. Awesome waitress! We had the yoghurt parfait, (which was huge!) and a pancake/cinnamon toast egg sandwich that was to die for. You will get your money's worth and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick bite on the way to the movies without much time to study the menu. However, the Philly steak and cheese looked appetizing and as always I checked. the menu to see if it listed green peppers as I have an allergy, and detest even the smell. No peppers, just grilled onions, melted cheese and (an extra charge for mushrooms) on a sourdough roll. We ordered the sandwich to split, an order of fries and the waitress was very efficient knowing we had limited time. She brought two plates, the check and everything was nicely presented in record time until I caught a whiff! Peppers! My husband rolled his eyes because he has no sense of smell but I have the nose of a bloodhound. Sure enough, as he sliced it in half, he found them. I picked them out as did he, because he doesn't like them either. The waitress came to bring my change and noticed we were picking out the peppers. She immediately offered to have the sandwich remade but we didn't have time. A few minutes later the manager came over and offered to make something different we could take to go and apologized that the menu made no mention of peppers and was very gracious. I told him it was fine and I'm usually not obnoxious about it when they make an effort like that. The sandwich was actually tasty and the peppers were small, added quite late to the cooking process so hadn't contaminated the process. We ate quickly and left. The food was good, the menu was pretty extensive with generous portions, the place was very clean, service was great and we'd definitely go back again and take more time."}
{"text":"What a fabulous find!!  Saw the place on Yelp and asked the lady working at our hotel how it was for breakfast...she said it was great!!  She was ABSOLUTELY right!!!  The people working there were very welcoming to us \"out of towners\" and couldn't have been nicer!!  The food was very good...try the cheese hashbrown casserole...YUM!!!   We always try to try where the locals go and we found it here!! Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"We have been regulars for the past four years dining as much as twice a week. However, we will no longer visit King's. They have changed their menu, attempted to upgrade the interior, they got rid of the kids meal dining card, they no longer sell Frownies, and the staff does not like the changes either. What made King's a great place to take a family is forever ruined.  You have easily lost $7,000 a year from my family as a result of your upgrades. I understand you need to change/evolve to keep up with the competition but you guys blew it. Our business will now go to Eat and Park."}
{"text":"Man, I hadn't been to this King's in years. Friday night, we needed supplies from Wal Mart, so we stopped in for dinner.   It's interesting how King's is Eat N Park's opposite number, it's Bizarro-world counterpart if you will.  EnP has the Smiley cookie. King's answers it with the brilliant and rebellious (well, for a family chain anyway) Frownie.   EnP has the Superburger. King's has the K-Boy.  Yeah, I know. It sounds like the name of a rapper or club DJ.   And it's exactly like the Superburger in almost every way. You get those moist, grey patties that taste better than their looks would have you think. They are both double-deckers. Each has its \"special sauce\" along with the shredded lettuce, the tomato, the diner-borne chutzpah.  However can ya get a fried egg on your Superburger?  \"Ah-hahhh\" says Hartley King, the company's larger-than-life founder and frontman.   So we'll call it a 4 star draw. The Superburger and the K-Boy both go to the 1-hour time limit in their dream match.   And don't forget  to try this amazing sundae on Memorial Day, which includes deep-fried (!) Frownies, to help support area veterans. It's still on the menu...  http://kingsfamily.com/about/in-the-news.aspx  P.S. Our waitress Alycia was whipsmart like Liz Phair and a joy to be served by."}
{"text":"Gone down hill since new owners took over cheese burger Quesada was barely edible wife had chicken tenders with mashed potatoes and chicken gravey which I'll call odd colored water mashed potatoes weren't edible either"}
{"text":"After being bought out by another Conglomerate, I expected things to go downhill. The first visit didn't impress, but the consecutive visits have been alright.   I'm disappointed they took the frownie off the menu, but some choices (skillets) have improved things. It's still King's, but different. Not bad, but different."}
{"text":"This place is a mess, I was there when it opened and it was sub par. Now it just sucks. They can't cook anything right other than hamburger and the service is horrible.  Really, so bad I can't begin to explain.  So unless your ready to drop over dead from hunger I would avoid this Kings like the plague."}
{"text":"This place has truly gone downhill since new ownership took over.  My wife ordered an ham and mushroom omelet.  When it came out it looked liked scrambled eggs with exactly 6 pieces of ham and 6 sliced mushrooms.  My mom's toast was so dry, it crumbled in her hand when she went to pick it up.  Even the convenience of this place being close to home won't make our family go back."}
{"text":"While traveling for work, I found this place on Yelp. The food was great and so was the service. I will absolutely return when in this area again."}
{"text":"Had breakfast there with my brother and sister and none of us were impressed. Each of us had a different breakfast entrée and in each case the results were nothing to write home to mom about. Suggest finding a better place for breakfast at least."}
{"text":"My parents and grandparents have been taking me here since I was very young. I've never come here on my own as an adult, until I took my twelve year old cousin out last night. We stopped here before dropping her off for dessert. They do have a great dessert menu with all of the basics- pie (fruit and cream), sundaes, splits, and ice cream. We could seat ourselves and our sever was incredibly prompt and even brought the staff over to sing happy birthday for my cousin and put a candle in her banana split. It was a very kind gesture! This is a good place to take kids for a straightforward diner style menu."}
{"text":"King's is probably not the best place to get a meal. I think If you were going to King's it would be for some late night desserts (especially their ice cream). Other than that, I typically try and avoid King's. Their food is not the best.   My latest venture to King's was for breakfast with some friends. I ultimately decided on the Egg Bagel Sandwich - fried egg, American cheese and sausage patty. This was ultimately a serviceable sandwich. The bagel was pretty tasteless and dry. The fried egg, cheese and sausage were ok, once again nothing stellar. The bagel sandwich came with a choice of potato. I choose the hash browns. These were tasteless and greasy.   The service was pretty good. Our waiter was attentive and brought refills throughout the meal. It's quite unfortunate that the quality of food does not meet the service. King's is never my first choice for a meal. If you have to go to King's go for ice cream."}
{"text":"Kings is a regional family style restaurant chain, similar to Denny's or Eat and Park. And as the signature dessert of eat and park is the smiley cookie, King's features the frownie brownie.    The first thing you notice about this Kings when walking in is that it does appear dated. It seems as though you are back in the 70s or 80s. I didn't mind it much, and apparently neither did the producers of the movie \"Perks of being a Wallflower\" because they shot part of the film there.    Usually these types of places serve bland and uninspired food, but, I've eaten at this Kings several times now, and the food has usually been good. The pecan crusted tilapia was as good as anything I've eaten anywhere. The triple cheese burger was just an immense about of food, 3/4 pound, but it was good beef, even if the beef overwhelmed the bun. The country friend steak was a disappointment, it was mushy and seemed more appropriate for the over 60 set. The appetisers were good also. Desserts at King's are really excellent. Cinnamon ice cream and apple pie is my favorite.  The service at this King's has always been friendly, and prompt, and I have never had a complaint. The staff seems to go out of their way to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"The wait staff was nice and I liked the crushed ice. Those were the positives. They were out of straws, French fries, and two kinds of fish. Service was slowwww. Food was subpar. It was served up without a care and flopped unceremoniously on a plate. Everything went wrong. Won't be back. I imagine the management is just terrible."}
{"text":"We usually have a good experience. Service was slow. Food came out cold. Waited for an hour or so. Hasbrown were ok. Steak was kinda mostly breading. I will try and be back but not on holiday. Texture was not right too. It was overdone. Steak was suppose to be the star. Founding, the Hasbrown to be better. Just note dnt go to kings on father's day"}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service. Waitress not very friendly or helpful. Since Kings was bought out and not family owned anymore, prices went up and quality of food went down. Cold breakfast, no syrup containers, a joke. Very disappointed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Some things are okay, others really suck. It really all depends on whos working. Certain cooks are great while others should go back to cleaning tables. The servers all act nice until you leave to get a good tip and then make snarky remarks about how terrible you were. Overpriced for terrible food? No thanks."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years when I am in town visiting family. So many good memories. Stopped by to take my grandmother to lunch and our server and food did not disappoint. This was on Christmas Eve too and the place was well staffed and food arrived quickly.   They have two sections: 1 is more of a diner style tables, and 2 is more of a sit down restaurant. For the price of the food it is not a bad deal at all. They serve breakfast all day if you want and have a large selection for lunch/dinner type fare.   Definitely give them a shot and I don't think you will be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Well, you can see some of the changes to Kings made by their new owners. First, they took out the country look to the store and threw some bold (read ugly) colored paint on the wall. So much for investing in the business. Then they got rid of the sandwich that I've ordered for the past 35 years - the K-boy. In it's place, I got a sub-par, possibly beef burger which cost $8, including an extra $1 for a piece of American cheese. (Probably a 5,000% markup for those who are counting.)  At least they kept the special sauce. After 4 decades of going to Kings, I am sorry to say that I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Kings is part ice cream parlor, part restaurant and this is one of a chain.  And I think that the one I reviewed was the very first one.  It sells ice cream, sundaes, shakes, etc but sells a lot of food also.  More than it's competitors, such as Friendly's, etc.  We went for dinner because there aren't a ton of decent restaurants in this part of town and also because my aunt and brother like it.  Well, I like it too.  Last night I had one of their fish selections, broiled flounder.  It came with stir fried veggies, and cheesy rice.  The rice was pretty good and the fish was better.  Not great but not bad.  And the price was good, about $8 for my dinner.  And for dessert, I had a piece of pretty good pie and ice cream.  A good meal!"}
{"text":"Our server was friendly and smiling. Came for cinnamon ice cream and apple pie. Definitely wasnt like we remembered it. Just meh. When I lived here years ago, it was AWESOME. Today was just pink ice cream on a piece of pie. It didnt taste like anything. Bummer."}
{"text":"Years ago, this place was OK:  not great, but acceptable.  Now, it's a mess.  I tried to order a take-away turkey dinner. No one was available to take my order.  Only one register was open, but no one was there.  A couple waiting to pay told me they had stood there for 5 minutes.  Is there a manager? Should there be a new manager?  For mediocre food, this is not acceptable."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Below average food. Would never recommend. Luckily it was quick when they were pretty busy. Waitress was rude. We'd ask for something and she'd roll her eyes or huff and puff. Like isn't that your job? Now I remember why I don't eat here."}
