{"text":"This restaurant is adorable! It's small and cozy and intimate. The sushi was so fresh and jam packed with ingredients with a very thin layer of rice which anyone on a low carb diet would appreciate. The amount of sushi you get for your money is insane! It's the best I've ever seen in Toronto. And it amazes me that they manage to put almost double the fillings in, yet charge almost half the money! 

I will also add that the service was excellent. Our waitress was very patient with us and friendly. I almost felt like I was having dinner at her house! 

Best sushi restaurant in Toronto!!"}
{"text":"A nice local spot for cheap sushi. Everything is reasonably priced. I usually go for combo 1...8 spicy salmon rolls, 8 spicy tuna rolls and 8 yam rolls. All for about $14. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"The rice to fish/meat/topping ratio is amazing!  You definitely get your money's worth.  Lunch specials are always cheap and filling.  This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Qi Sushi. I visited the spot today while getting refuge from the cold weather. The restaurant was empty. My partner and I ordered combo #1 to share consisting of 8pc rolls of sweet potato tempura, spicy tuna, and spicy salmon. Even though we only ordered one combo to share, the server still brought out two cups of green tea and noodles in a soup with tempura bits - both complimentary. 

The atmosphere was nice and private.

The sushi was impeccable. I'm a big maki fan and my favourite roll is sweet potato tempura. The chef made it just how I liked it in Halifax, NS - the sweet potato hot and crunchy. The meal was so filling for the two of us. So far, Qi Sushi is one of my favourite sushi spots in Toronto. 

Best of us? The combo came to about $13 after tax.

There will be more visits here in the future."}
{"text":"Great place. Reasonably priced and large portions. Had a big plate of kalbi beef ($15), qi combo 1 (8pc spicy tuna, 8pc spicy salmon, 8pc yam tempura.. yam tempura is really good - $12), and unagi roll (6pc - $6). Service was attentive and they gave us orange slices for desert. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Left me wanting more. Much much more. Waitress doesn't know how to give good service. She rushed me and took my menu when I wanted more than one item. And when I wanted to order something else she came and gave me my bill. Not impressed. Still hungry but I just wanted outta there.
Oh and uncomfortable seating. Sushi was ok though."}
{"text":"It's so cheap here and it tastes good but not orgasmic. I highly recommend this place if you're craving sushi and want a lot for cheap!"}
{"text":"If I had to review solely on my meal, I'd give it a 5/5, however, I could not ignore the service I received at this restaurant during my lunch on April 29th.

Our server was very nice, although slow, she was kind and warm. 

Now for the story as to why I decided to create a Yelp account and give my first review EVER. At the end of our meal, my boyfriend and I had patiently waited for our server to come by our table so that we could pay for our lunch and leave, but because the restaurant had gotten busy by the end of our meal, she became quite occupied. We were seated by the window to the right of the door and at that time, there was a large wooden divider which blocked our view of the staff at the front. I am a tiny person and so, in what I believed made most sense and completely normal, raised my hand to get the attention of our server so we could get our bill. After a while (I couldn't remember at this point if my hand was still in the air) our server finally came. Alongside our server was an older woman, who then scoffed at me and mocked me by raising her hand and acting as if what I did - getting the attention of our server - was wrong. I don't understand why I experienced such poor service, especially from management, considering that this place is a shoebox and therefore, there should be no reason as to why service from such a small restaurant shouldn't be pristine.

I will be taking out or using delivery from this restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"Good service and great value for what you get! Combo 6 is my favourite. The staff are very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"The portions blew my mind. I've never seen such large chunks of avocado. A nice surprise was the little offering of cold noodles in tempura dipping sauce with tempura bits in it that came as a free app. Yum. Everything was fresh and nicely presented. It would've gotten 5 stars but our order of 3 rolls took more than half an hour to get to our table and there were only 2 other patrons in the place. I would most definitely come back though since it's so worth the price for the quantity and quality."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place has such good reviews on yelp.  I went there for lunch and ended up spending 20 dollars per person. Not cool. 
The food: it was just alright.  The sushi pretty much all broke. They tried to put a lot of vegetable in it.  And jts got no taste. The sashimi is fine. I don't think it deserves the price- 20 dollars. 
Atmosphere : the place is too small. The table is small. I felt u comfortable eating there 
Service : it was OK but the lady doesn't speak English and we had trouble understanding her. Also one thing I wanna say is that the people there are Koreans not Japanese."}
{"text":"I used to live in Cabbagetown, and I miss this place!  These owners are incredibly friendly.  This place is so yummy.  Sushi aside, they also have great udon!"}
{"text":"I walked away feeling deeply dissatisfied with the meal and taken advantage of. Here is why: 

1. NOWHERE in the menu does it state that rolls are tempura-laden. I ordered Qi Combo 1, described as: \"spicy salmon, spicy tuna, yam\". I thought \"well, isn't this a pleasant assortment of light rolls\". I knew \"yam\" would likely be tempura, but others on the table would peck at that. Those delicious salmon and tuna rolls would be all mine... nomnomnom. Well, when the tray showed up, it was just one mass of orange: tempura batter covered in spicy mayo. It was even impossible to tell what each roll was. I talked to the waitress and was even more appalled: 
- Me: \"Oh, the menu did not say that these were all tempura, I cannot eat tempura...\"
- Waitress: \"Everyone that comes here is a regular, so everyone knows these are tempura...\" Walks away without apology or solution...

Writing a menu assuming you will not get any new customers that need details on what they are ordering seems ridiculous to me. Tempurizing everything, even more ridiculous. It's fine, this new customer will NOT become a regular.

2. My boyfriend ordered the Qi Boat A, which was priced at $22. The waitress delivers the Small Boat, priced at $45. We clarify that (1) this is not what we ordered and (2) it's absurd that we could eat that much food, the waitress said \"ohhh, next time you know...\" and again walked away without apology or solution. The boat contained * again * about 50% deep-fried items... I resorted to eating the daikon garnish.

Don't come hungry. Don't come celiac. Don't come period."}
{"text":"Sashimi is so fresh, and they don't load up their sushi and rolls with rice. Great quality and great value!"}
{"text":"This place makes you crave sushi. I love ordering the Green Dragon Roll (avocado on top) and occasionally the Black Dragon (unagi on top). Its super filling and filled with great vegetable portions inside the roll with the perfect amount of rice. However, the best part is Jenny, the owner, who makes you feel so welcomed and happy, and will not put up with your shiz, so please do not be rude. Its a cute little sushi joint so dont expect your food to be made in seconds, the chef really puts all his passion and love into his creations, I would recommend ordering some appetizers first if you're hangry. I come here at least a few times a month, and never get sick of it. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great fresh sushi, even better value and lots of small nice touches like a small ramen soup bowl to start, nice fragrant tea with a pot, and orange slices to end. 

Had the sushi combos 1 and 2 and couldn't believe the size of the plates - huge and only $12.  Salmon sushi was thick and long and had a nice silver edge on it as you would get in a higher end sushi spot.  While not the best sushi restaurant in the area...that honor goes to John Lee's amazing OMI restaurant, it's half the price of OMI so good for more frequent casual outings."}
{"text":"My strongest recommendation.  This place is great.  Very healthy portions, fast and friendly service.  That's why we keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place was rated so high.
The deco is really cute. Look like family owned restaurant in Japan. The service is nice too.
However the food is disappointing.
I ordered the California sushi pizza and black dragon roll.
The roll has Unagi on top. The taste is average. A lot cucumber. The last piece was fell apart. The gods thing is its large portion.
The California pizza is surprising. But not the flavor I like. Kind of spicy. And eating a lot of fried things always make sick.
One sweet thing. They give you small bite dish between the order and all taste ok. 
Overall, good service and deco, fair price, large portion, average taste. The rate is too high and got me high expectation. But actually You can find the same menu in many other Japanese restaurant in that level. It is safe place."}
{"text":"Quaint and full of character, Qi Sushi (pronounced 'Ki' as in KI-wi) is going to be a fast favourite in your book of restaurant go-tos. 

First of all, the place is intimate and nicely (and newly!) renovated to include little rooms to have your meal in. The servers are very kind and patient as you decide what to have through their extensive menu. They will often bring you a little soup on the house as you prepare to have your meal. They will also serve you tea as soon as you sit down. The quality of their puffed rice green tea is excellent - really nice to sip as you wait. 

IN a Nutshell:

- Really great service. Lots of care taken to give you a beautiful display. 
- Food is really fresh and clean. Fish is of great quality and cut. 
- Nice extras: green tea, soup and oranges to cleanse your palate at the end of the meal. 
- REALLY reasonable combo prices - $10 gets me Spicy Salmon rolls (8pcs), Salmon Sushi (3pcs), Salmon Sashimi (3pcs)

2 people can pay $35 and get a REALLY great meal - 2 combos, 2 appetizers including tip. 

If you decide to do takeout, they have some cash only specials that are really cheap. They will also give you green tea while you wait for your order. Such a nice touch. 

Will keep coming back for sure."}
{"text":"Great sushi, large rolls, amazing prices & beautiful presentation - what more can you ask for.

Qi Sushi has been my place to go to for sushi in Toronto now. It's a small restaurant but the service is great and the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great value for your sushi dollars. I'm not sure it's a destination, but if you are nearby and looking for some great sit-down or take-out, this place will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Extra charge for water/tea refills. 
Three out of four visits, sushi took 40 minutes to come. 
Ordered Sushi Combo #1: the sushi pieces has more fillings and less rice = awesome! 

Sushi is great but service lacks. My throat was itchy and they were going to charge me extra for a tap water refill."}
{"text":"Been to 3 sushi bars in Cabbage town - Omi, Kibo and Qi. Qi is by far and away the best. Nice big portions - though we did order a la carte. Friendly service. The avocado rolls are gigantic, with perfect avocado. The sashimi pieces are huge. The sushi have huge pieces of fish, although I would like the rice beneath to be a little larger. Definite recommendation to try this one. Used to live in Markham and the best one up there is Mine at Yonge and Elgin Mills. Qi is easily as good as Mine."}
{"text":"This place is great it's small and cozy. Great place to catch up over sushi for lunch or dinner. You get a lot of sushi for you money"}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise.  It's cozy, well decorated and with good ambiance.  It has the feel of a hole in the wall Japanese place and I'd be quite happy to sit and munch away for a time.  The service is good and everything looks freshly prepared when you order.

The food itself is quite good.  I think their best items are the salmon.  When I order salmon sashimi and sushi here, either separately or as part of a combo, the pieces are a good size and good quality.  This is different from my most common experience at other sushi places where you either get size or quality but not both.  This makes me quite happy because salmon is my favourite."}
{"text":"If you eat sushi as much as we do, you know there isn't much to be surprised about. But Qi Sushi surprised us in some really great ways. 

We were greeted with big smiles, a random group of six wandering about the east part if Toronto on a Sunday, reuniting after a few months, looking for a quiet place for good food and time to catch up with each other, a rare moment in busy lives. 

Happening upon this small and intimate venue we took advantage of the curtained booth. The first surprise was to be served brown rice tea instead if the usual green tea. The nutty roasted flavor was subtle and simply a nice change. 

Even the tempura dipping sauce brought a subtle twist. Significantly less salty than the usual,  the ginger flavor and subtle sweetness made me smile and rave to my friends. 

The overall aura  is do peaceful and fun, we had to have our picture taken with our hostess to mark the occasion. All that in addition to what you'd expect for good sushi, but dinner for six cost a total of $61.00 and some change and we took home two containers of leftovers. 

Fantastic time, great venue, thanks Qi Sushi!"}
{"text":"Loved the meal! 
People , food and presentation are great.
 Good value. 
Visited early July / 2012, will definitely return often."}
{"text":"Really food!! We ate a Black dragon rolls and a Sashimi bento. Both were great. Also the waitress was so kind:) I can sure it's better than any sushi buffet."}
{"text":"Relatively small place but the food is amazing. Got combo 5 and the seaweed salad. Food was quick and the lady was super friendly. The salad is the best that I have ever had. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! It might seem small from the outside. But it's pretty decently spaced inside. 

THE APPETIZER:
Is delicious and unique

MAIN ENTREES:
I've had most of the items and they are, in my opinion, one of the best in Toronto.

DESSERT:
can't go wrong with oranges :)"}
{"text":"The freshness and quality of the fish is awesome, and so are the generous portions! One of the better sushi places in Toronto. Very similar to what you'd get in Vancouver. Great value too! Friendly staff, and quick delivery! I just wish they'd get on justeat.ca for easier ordering!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! Delivery costs $2.50 extra and you have to order more than $20. I've tried a few of their special rolls and they never disappoint. I came from Vancouver where sushi joints are plentiful and all above average. I have to say this is one of my favourite sushi spots."}
{"text":"I like the black dragon and spicy salmon rolls."}
{"text":"Wow! The people that work here are rude AF. 

Came here on a Saturday evening. There was nobody dining here. Asked if they had takeout. The male \"server\" looks up and down, doesn't say a word or really attempt to make eye contact, hands me a menu. He doesn't offer to let me take a seat or anything. Meanwhile, the 2-3 other employees in the kitchen are just staring at me as if I interrupted their entire life. 

Honestly, the way everyone stared at me was as if I had killed someone in front of them. It was really weird and uncomfortable. 

Unfortunately, I was STARVING and really needed something to eat, so I made an order. 

What a shame because this restaurant is really cute with some cozy booths. And the food was not bad. 

But really, one of the worst service I've ever had. Come here if you're feeling particularly good about yourself and you'd like to get knocked down a notch for whatever reason."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem

I was wary of trying a sushi place on a stretch of Gerrard E that has been a culinary wasteland (between Sackville and Parliament). However, this place is well worth it. The bento boxes are a great deal and very tasty. You can add little extras like more sushi rolls or gyoza for another couple of bucks.The QI Sushi dinner is great and features large shrimp tempura rolls, tuna, salmon and whitefish. Very basic but good. The only item I've had I wasn't completely thrilled with was the veggie tempura, which seems to be a third large pieces of deep fried onion. Overall, the quality is better than what you would expect from a little hole in the wall and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"One of my fav sushi places to go. Great service and their sushi rolls and made with a thin layer of rice with lots of stuffing. I've had sine in and take out from here, I usually get their combos. Going to come back sometime for their lunch promos!"}
{"text":"Rude af. I called to get delivery and the woman on the phone told me that my location is too far (I live a 5 minute drive away according to google). I ask how far they went, she named the street that turns into mine. I started to express my confusion and she hung up on me. Flabbergasted, I called back. Her response was \"IM SOOOO SORRY. Can I hang up now?\" Not only is this the worst customer service I've ever received from a restaurant, but the woman I spoke to was intentionally being rude to me. I was really excited to try the food here as it has great reviews but there isn't a chance in hell I'm giving these a**holes my business. Just goes to show that you can have amazing food but if you don't know how to treat (potential) customers then the food quality is irrelevant."}
{"text":"I'll put this sushi up against any in the city. The nigiri is more fish than rice,  the rolls are beautiful even before they are delicious. 
The service is very sweet and friendly,  and the prices are crazy reasonable"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. It's a small place, easy to miss but makes one of the best sushi dishes in town! The waitress gave us 4 noodle dishes in a warm tempura sauce like broth. This was a free appetizer that we didn't order but it tasted great.  We ordered two Bento boxes which had very generous portions. The tempura shrimp was very well done: has a nice crispy batter and was fried to perfection. I have tried lots of tempura before and this I must say was the very best. Even the miso soup, often overlooked by many restaurants had a nice touch of miniature mushrooms floating on top. We also ordered the Qi sushi roll and dragon roll and both were excellent. The sushi and ingredients are very fresh. 

The prices were very reasonable for this level of quality. Service was fast and very friendly too. 

Would definitely go back there anytime we're in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Qi sushi is small and cozy with a beautiful smiling owner. She is always so happy and smiles so heartily. She truly makes u feel welcome when u dine in and take out.

I love the gyoza and the black dragon roll with eel. Portions are big and tastes super yummy. My boyfriend loves the bento boxes and katsu dinner. We also love the free noodle soup tempura they give u as a starter when u done in. The spicy mayo is also good but I wished that the spicy mayo would be free instead of a dollar fifty when u take out.

The shrimp tempura and sashimi is really good, however when I tried the salmon teriyaki it wasn't as good as the other dishes they provide.

Also, if u want modification on some dishes, u may not always get it because it's really hard to communicate with the server since English is not their first language. But all in all, it's a great addition to the neighbourhood!!"}
{"text":"i can't believe this is a 4.5 star yelp establishment. maybe we need to define what 5 star means, yelp? Is this really \"Woohoo, As good as it gets\" ???

the only guidance we have for ratings is the little blurb of text above the review box. And for 2 stars it says \" Meh. I've experienced better\", by that scale I think maybe that's even generous for Qi Sushi.  

I have to say that i was quite excited to come here for dinner on saturday night. i even drove from quite far to get here. the place itself is nothing special, it has aesthetics which can typically be sported by locations of amazing food quality, but by no other establishment, especially when the food and service are sort of lack-luster (1/5).

maybe the best part of this business is its price (3/5), since i am struggling to find any other good features. the food was quite bland, and some fish tasted unfresh, un creative and stale (2/5). 

the service (2/5) was super slow and we had to wave down the person after waiting on many occasions for 10-15 mins for her to come out form the back. the place was full and no-one was attending to it."}
{"text":"Sushi was decent, tasted alright for its price. A really small place, not good for groups. Got combo meals with a friend. A handful of pieces (near the ends of the rows) were falling apart because there was not enough toppings in them. Plating was fine aside from that. (Just saying they have weird ginger that is not pink, which tastes off and I don't enjoy it)
But, service was horrible! It was slow and people were rude.I asked the waitress about what their tempura ice cream was and if it was fried ice cream or something. It stated right in their menu \"tempura ice cream\" and she just had an attitude that felt belittling, saying what are you talking about there's not such thing. I mean come on, know what you are selling if you are working there. I guess no dessert for me. The attitude was a problem. Service is supposed to be friendly. Moreover, as I stated it was slow. It was not a full restaurant, but decently full (2-3 other groups of two). Lastly, of all things. My friend tipped 10% on the card machine, but she did not see that it was in dollars and not percentage. So it came out to be 10 cents, which we were unaware. As we stood up and at the door, instead of asking politely about the tip, the waitress called the manager, stopped us at the door, and she rudely, and to think she had the audacity to do it, said \"you only tipped 10 cents\" threw the receipt to us and left. To think that service could not get worse, it hit an all time low. If she asked nicely, we would have tipped her as we meant to do. Restaurants are not about the food only, it is also the experience and service, and the food is not good enough to warrant a return if it means dealing with the horrible service again. Finally, it is up to the customer's discretion on how much to tip so do not act like you are entitled to it if it not on the bill. We had the full intention to tip and if you were polite about it you would have got it. Lost not only the tip but also our business. I frequented this place too, bought many meals here whenever I was in the mood for cheap sushi. A big shame."}
{"text":"The waitress was un-attentive and made us feel that we were wasting her time.  Food order came wrong (vegetarians were served a beef dish).  I had to go to the counter and ask for another round of drinks, and finally to get our bill."}
{"text":"I ordered from here and all the sushi rolls had filler not real fish pieces 
I ordered 60 dollars worth only to throw it away. 
I won't ever order here again"}
{"text":"I LOVE THE 6$ LUNCH SPECIALS, they never disapoint me and are cheap and are made the way i like them (i ask them if i want my chicken more grilled or not) I ALSO LOVE GETTING SASHIMI AND NIGIRI FROM THIS PLACE, NICE LONG STRIPS OF SALMON AND SMALL BALLS OF RICE THAT'S A DONE DEAL. seriously,MORE FISH THAN RICE *applouse*, where's another place you know that does that ;) 

the kind service is amazing and I love this family owned restaraunt, and they actually are japanese(some japanese places aren't owned/runed by Japanese). 

also thankyou waiters I like when you make my sushi combo platers look really pretty so I can instagram them :)."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, huge portions, affordable, and friendly. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Had amazing sushi this evening...the only disappointing dish was the seafood soup which had fake crab, but the main was fresh and delicious...definitely will go back again...the tuna Tataki was so fresh and the sauce it was in, I wanted to drink it."}
{"text":"As a sushi addict, I always search for new sushi bars or restaurants, mostly all you can eat (a bottomless gut). 

If you are looking for good service , warm welcome this place is the best. 

-no all you can eat
-price/portion ratio: standart
-taste: fresh delicious.
-for $30 can have 2 combos

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came to this dainty sushi spot on a Sunday afternoon with a group of 20 people after church. Heard about it upon a friend's recommendation and boy is this such a great hidden little spot. Will be back again! 

Atmosphere: 4/5
Price: 5/5
Presentation: 3.5/5
Taste: 3.5/5
Portion: 6/5
Service: 6/5

Atmosphere: I wouldn't normally venture to this part of town of know of this restaurant if I had not heard about it from a friend. When you walk in, it's extremely cozy and definitely a place that you could host a great party with all your close friends over many shots of soju! The owners/waitress is so personable I got a very positive vibe from her.

Price: Really great value for the price you pay. 

Presentation: Typical presentation I would say. Nothing bad but nothing stood out either. 

Taste: I think their food is pretty typical of most sushi spots. I liked how they had noodles in their soup which is different. 

Portion: Their servings are actually ginormous. Combo 1 or A - forgot which one - came with three rolls, including my favourite wh he is the sweet potato roll ($12). We shared this between four people and were already full! We also order another combo which came with a lobster roll ($15). Still liked the sweet potato more though. 

Service: We had a group of 20 people and I called the restaurant only 20 minutes before we arrived to let them know we were coming. All of us got seated immediately and they even let us reconfigure some of the dividers in the restaurant just so we could combine tables. They were pretty prompt with service even though we had a large group. My tea was always full and I never had to ask the waitress for more."}
{"text":"I found this to be a really cute and quaint place.  I order a combo with spicy salmon roll, cucumber avocado roll, and sweet potato roll.  The sushi was very well done with only a little bit of rice.  The only thing I was disappointed with was the tempura used for the spicy salmon roll and yam because I felt it was over done and there were hard pieces.  They should've also specified that the yam was tempura-ed.  The service was great.  Our server was super friendly and accommodating.  I will definitely come back to try it again."}
{"text":"We were at Riverdale Park looking for somewhere to eat sushi and read good reviews on this place. It's a small and cozy place and there was a few people there (it's 9pm on a Thursday). 

The waitress that served us was really kind and accommodating, really good, no complaints at all. We ordered 2 sushi rolls that came with 10 pcs - white snow roll and crunchy dragon roll. We waited quite some time to get our order but both rolls were good nonetheless. Zambia liked the crunchy dragon roll better than the other and we would recommend it. Opposed to the wait time, the only other complaint we really have is that they didn't give us plates so we were eating over our napkins.

Overall, we would come back to this place if we were in the area but wouldn't go out of our way to get here."}
{"text":"We discovered Qi Sushi because it was near Riverdale Farm. It was great. Small, but very clean, with intimate seating (although they easily accommodated our party of six). With bento boxes and some udon options in addition to sushi, there was something for everyone in our party. 

I had the Green Dragon Roll, which looked lovely and tasted better. My husband had udon with chicken which he described as \"fine.\" My daughter--she's two--had the teriyaki chicken Bento. She didn't eat much, but I think that's because she was eating my roll! I tasted her food and it tasted good, although a different style of teriyaki than we're familiar with. Others in our party had the salmon (great) and the shrimp and veggies tempura (also great). The tempura was light and crisp and not greasy. 

Miso soup is often served very salty. This was not, and we enjoyed that.

Servings were plentiful and price was reasonable. Wine and beer choices are very limited."}
{"text":"Ordered Gyoza and Salmon Sushi Pizza - both delicious!! Cozy booth, great food, great service. Paid with my MasterCard."}
{"text":"I love the cute owner. She's so friendly and sweet that I keep coming back!!

I do love the katsu here. The chicken and pork katsu is really good and they give big portion of it. I always order the black dragon roll and love how you can order 1 shrimp tempura or 5. Sometimes if its just me, I can realistically only eat 1-2 so I like how they give you the option of ordering small.

The atmosphere is really small but quaint. 

Flavour and freshness wise as a whole menu is only about 3.5 but the welcomeness and gratitude they show your customers makes you want to come back and support their business. To me, the black dragon roll and the katsu is a solid 5 out of 5. I been to many sushi place where the chicken katsu was breaded, soggy, and gross but at Qi its very crispy and yummy. Its one of their must tries."}
{"text":"Well, for the third time this month we had a spectacular meal at Qi! The Qi Sushi Roll is amazing. The tempura is the perfect amount of \"breading\" and cooked to perfection. This cozy restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly. However, the sushi is (as one would hope) the star. So fresh and delicious. The sashimi platter has great variety and everything is spot on. The soups (broth with noodle AND the miso) are also quite nice. Qi sushi is definitely a diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"Qi Sushi is my favourite sushi place in the east end!  The owner - sorry Unnie I don't know your name - who is often at the cash, is the sweetest thing, always has a smile and is down for joking around.

I would love to see this place expand their Korean dishes to jajangmyeon, or pajeons - but that's just a secret dream of mine haha.

the price point, the food and portion sizes, and the homely hospitality earns this place a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"What a great sushi place, everything was delicious high quality and at a very reasonable price. Chirashi was delicious and so fresh. The unagi was delicious and sauced well. Across the board there were generous pieces of top notch fresh fish."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem! I had what everyone else is suggesting.. that combo with salmon and sweet potatoes - It's a pretty large portion. I also tried the sashimi - pretty fresh and I enjoyed it very much. 

one bone to pick with this place tho: Why don't you open on Mondays??? At least 2 Mondays in the past month or so I been wanting sushi and it was such a disappointment. Please open mondays."}
{"text":"Nice owner (?) and for sushi the pricing is A-OK, but I've definitely had mediocre sushi at better value downtown closer to UofT (i.e. Top Sushi). The interior is cute and traditional-style; at lunchtime on a weekday the place had plenty of available seating. The bento lunch combos are pretty large, but never order just an appetizer sashimi for a meal, which is what I did once and it literally came with the exact # of pieces (9 or something) and the pieces were so small :'( Way too little food...

Major con is that it is pretty out of the way relative to downtown core; you pretty much have to walk (or take the bus, but no one likes the bus). I wouldn't come back again unless I was en route to Bridgepoint Hospital."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The babe and I were the only ones in here on an early Wednesday dinner time.

Service was sweet and prompt. I was surprised to see how reasonably priced the sushi dishes were. The server started us both with a complimentary miso, crunchy noodle soup, and hot green tea.

I enjoyed the soups and my meal which was the salmon combo. The spicy salmon was very tasty and the salmon sashimi was super fresh. The BF ordered the #1 combo which was spicy tuna, spicy salmon, and yam rolls. He said the majority of his rolls were actually tempura and not fish/yams so he was not a fan.

I would definitely return and would like to try out other rolls on the menu."}
{"text":"The lady that takes your order in this place is so incredibly rude, they have lost my business. I have been in here to eat and take out food and each time have been spoken to rudely. Tonight was the final time, it is not the right to treat customers or people in that manner.

Food is average, not the best but was convenient location to me home."}
{"text":"We discovered this jewel in our neighborhood about 7 months ago and have become regulars.  The owner is fantastic!  The service is amazing, the quality of food is second to none, and we thoroughly enjoy each visit.   The restaurant is small but nicely appointed, and the menu offers fantastic choice.  I could pick from many places for Japanese food, but Qi Sushi has become my go - to place and I'm only too happy to share this review.  The takeout service is also fantastic."}
{"text":"I feel so bad by giving a bad review to this place just because our service was amazing, I'm pretty sure this is a family business and our server was probably the owners wife or in some way related.. and she was the sweetest, I can't complain about her at all. 
First of all the place is super small and I loved that, kind of hidden, I read the reviews and were for the most part pretty good so I was excited.

Let's talk about the food 
We ordered a LOT of food, we were hungry and the prices were really cheap. 
For the must part ordered lots of items with salmon (we love salmon) 
The salmon tasted... Something weird, I'm not sure what it was but maybe had something to do with the freshness, it was very slimy. I started to feel gross after eating so we ordered some sake 
(idk if it makes sense but usually when something doesn't agree with me I take a tequila shot and problem solved, they didn't have tequila so I figured sake) 
Anyways we ordered some \"crunchy\" roll, you know with the delish fried crunchy stuff.. OK there was like a pound  of the crunchy stuff, there was even green crunchy stuff, I mean the roll was totally surrounded by crunchiness. It was too much and it didn't taste good, by that time we were regrating the amount of food that we ordered.  I wanted to leave our plates were almost full. 

don't go with big expectations"}
{"text":"The lunch menu is pretty good! Good price and big portion. The restaurant is small but the fish is really fresh and everyone is friendly. It's somewhat in the middle of nowhere but is worth the walk if you're craving some sushi at work."}
{"text":"Portions are generous to say the least. Ordered the tempura udon, rainbow roll and pork katsu. Udon was very flavourful. Tempura was ok, not as crispy as I was expecting. Pork katsu was ok. Rainbow roll was gigantic but have to say not that good. Service was amazing and for the location this place was a pleasant surprise. Would go back if I'm in the area and try something else like the bento boxes on the menu."}
{"text":"The sushi is so fresh, the portion is really huge and the service is awesome and fast. Seeing some reviews but the lady is friendly to us. Now we go there almost three or four times a week and the lady treats us just like her children. The best sushi place you can ever had in Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Toronto hands down. Found this yelp one day trying to find some decent sushi in the downtown core. Not exactly downtown but the wifey lived nearby so we tried it out.  I got a maki combo for 12 bucks, if not mistaken,  and came with three rolls which were all delicious.  12 bucks!!!! She got some rolls as well and the bill ended up being around 40 but we were stuffed and raving about the the food. The food was so good we even walked home which took us over a hour!!!! Good food makes you do crazy things. This was in the summer time so the weather was a bit more forgiving. We have returned multiple times to try out the sashimi, sushi, maki rolls and we have never been disappointed. Maybe come summer time we will visit sushi qi and walk all the way home again."}
{"text":"Good sushi for a low price, definitely isn't over charged like certain mediocre restaurants. One of my top five sushi places to go to no doubt. I've been there twice and the quality is still the same. It's a small korean family owned restaurant but they do delivery. They are reallly nice and give complementary ice cream and other things once in a while. The decor in there is also cute although it has a smaller space they made the best out of it. The first time i went i spent around 40$ but my boyfriend and i were stuffed and had extra. I don't believe that there are many gems like this anymore or they are hard to find and hidden away."}
{"text":"I'm thinking maybe Qi Sushi had an off day. 

It was my first time here, but based on the reviews I walked well out of my way to try it, instead of the other sushi places I'd considered. I ordered a crunchy avocado roll and sweet yam tempura roll. First off, the portions are huge and the prices are great. You really can't beat them. The service was great, really friendly. Sadly, the food didn't live up to my expectations.

The avocado roll kept falling apart. I'd say 6 of the 8 pieces totally fell apart, to the point I had to just kind of pick it up with my hand in pieces and shove it all in my mouth. That was the first disappointment. The yam tempura, which is one of my favorite go tos, was barely warm, and there was nothing drizzled on it, which now looking at other photos, it seems like there should have been. Overall, it was ok, but it all tasted very bland to me, which was really disappointing."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place. I like the low rice-to-filling ratio: lots of fish, little bit of rice. Generous portions as well, they really make efforts to please their customers and it shows. The service is warm and homely, I love the woman who serves me, reminds me of my mom :)"}
{"text":"Tried ordering take out the other day. A more mature lady (I believe it's the owner) didn't hear clearly what I wanted to order (my order was sashimi appetizer), and I was asking questions if they had anything just w salmon sashimi. 
I told her I wanted the sashimi appetizer, and I guess She was confused and thought I want both salmon sashimi and sashimi appetizer, when I told her I wanted just sashimi appetizer, she rudely stated \" WELL THEN SPEAK CLEARLY\" to me.  I told her forget about the order, and I walked away. 
I would never go back for experience like this."}
{"text":"Dined here for dinner on a Sunday night.  The restaurant is actually pretty small, but feels cozy.  There was no line up so we were seated immediately. 

Had the combo 1 spicy salmon, spicy tuna and yam tempura roll (8pieces each) for $12.  I thought that this was a great deal, however, wished I enjoyed this meal more.  Im not a big fan of spicy mayo so I didn't enjoy this as much.  I also found that there were too much tempura.  

Chirashi $15 was pretty good.  Adequate amount of sashimi - came with 15 pieces on a bed of rice.  The quality of sashimi was great.  

Sashimi salad $8. I just love Japanese restaurants salad dressing no matter where I go.  The salad dressing was good with minimal amount of sashimi"}
{"text":"Had a 10 dollar combo from here, it had yam sushi, 3 pieces of salmon sashimi and 3 pieces of salmon nigiri. It was okay, the salmon was reasonably fresh though I felt that the yam sushi was a poor excuse for a sushi as it's purpose is literally to fill you up with the rich, starchy yam. For the record I actually quite liked the yam sushi, it was savory and sweet and when dipped in soy sauce had great umami flavor.

The salmon nigiri are quite small, normally I complain about nigiri sushi having too much rice, these nigiri have too little of it, a tiny boat of rice with a long tail of salmon. The waitress and owner are both very friendly.

Perhaps I should have tried the hyped lunch specials because for a 4 star yelp establlshment Qi sushi failed to impress."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. I don't like it when they use too much rice and this place does it just right. Sushi is the perfect size for eating too. Fresh and high quality ingredients. Great service. We had a great time there. It's a real gem in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"No frills mom-and-pop eatery. Good for a quick pick up on a busy weekend night when you are just looking to stuff something in your face before conking out for the night. Qi combos (notably #1) are good value and gets you lots of food. I wouldn't recommend stand alone sushi or sashimi (quality is not that great), but the rolls are plenty solid. For what you pay, Qi Boat A for 2 is certainly NOT enough for 2 people to split, and the quality doesn't justify the charge. Stick to the rolls!"}
{"text":"I'm officially upgrading this place to 5 stars at the risk of increasing traffic at my favourite go-to sushi restaurant.  I've been coming back here often and have never been disappointed.  The service is superb and the quality of the food is consistently fresh and delicious.

Previously my visits have been take-out only, but I recently brought my date here for an dine-in experience.  The sectioned off areas offer a semi-private area making it perfect for intimate conversations.  We ordered the boat for 2 and thought that it made for a nice light dinner."}
{"text":"One year later and still very happy with their sushi quality & service! Ordered take out Combo # 10, Hamachi sushi, Toro tuna sushi, Shrimp sushi & Edamame."}
{"text":"This place is interesting. The interesting part is how unfriendly, almost mean the customer service is. The lady working there was rushing us a lot (it even felt funny and annoying) and arguing with us about everything. Our friend had specific dietary restrictions so he just wanted to find out what he could order, what's inside the sauces, rolls, etc. The lady seemed to be angry and refused to tell what's inside (did she think we want to steal the recipe?!) and very inpatient with us. If it took longer for us to decide what to order she got so impatient, kinda asked us to hurry up! It just felt wrong. Each time we talked to her, we were like \"Is this for real?!\" 
We ordered different items, sashimi, maki rolls, sushi rolls, gyoza soups and chicken dish. We were also given a small soup with noodles (free of charge) that unfortunately I did not enjoy. I mostly order vegetarian dishes and here was no exception. However my veggie gyoza soup contained fake crab sticks inside!! It's just so disgusting in my opinion. Fake crab sticks are one of the worst things (how they are made), so having this in my soup hiding was a horrible surprise when I specifically asked that I want vegetarian soup.
On the other hand their rolls are amazing. I guess worth the mean lady! Haha. 
I love that they add so little rice in their rolls. Not many places do that. So that's a huge plus, that's where they get their 3 stars from me. 
Avocado Roll was one of the best I ever had, however their yam tempura roll was not good. Even if it looked good, the yam was just a tiny amount, the biggest part was crunchy fried stuff around it, it was way too much and too hard; felt like eating fish bones.
Another negative part was the wait time. It took way too long for the food to arrive. Would I go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Love the place. Staff is friendly and I have never had any problems with the food. Really convenient place for me."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place!

The food is awesome and very well priced.  I've only had the pleasure of dining there once and it was a rush one.  The restaurant closes at 10 and we walked in at 9:30.  The sushi was made fresh and on our table within 10 minutes and after eating we still had five minutes left to tip the waitress.

The prices are very reasonable and good portion sizes.  Did I mention that it tastes great!  

We do take-outs for our office almost once a week and everyone loves it!"}
{"text":"small, cute, and tasty. 
The friendly staff make sure you enjoy your sitting, and though it is a rather small restaurant, sitting about only 25 people maximum, the food is exceptional. 
If you like big sushi, thats worth your money, and not tiny skimpy sushi that costs a fortune, qi sushi is your japanese restuarant. located in the east end of downtown toronto, it serves the growing community of regent park and abroad. the area is cleaning up, and qi sushi exemplifies the progress. 
extremely happy with the service, and staff, and the food is to die for. Top favourite of mine, QI Sushi Roll, their signature roll, a real crowd pleaser, its huge, inexpensive,(especially for the amount of food), and tastes fantastic."}
{"text":"I love this place! Generous portions and great customer service. The first time I ate at the restaurant, their service was very slow as it was a busy day but the female server was as attentive as she could be. 

I would definitely recommended the Qi sushi, Sushi Combo #1, #4 and Sushi Pizza. The cod fish was a disappointment but I'm more than happy to support this great, family-run establishment."}
{"text":"Nice small spot with very friendly people running the shop.  We ordered the boat -  mix of sashimi,  sushi and make.  They were all very fresh,  good size and good portion.  We also ordered their spacial Qi sushi roll which was excellent. We even had left over enough for another meal which we packed to go. For around to only $25 per person (not including tip) ,  it was excellent."}
{"text":"They've decorated the place since I visited last march. At that time, I felt dissatisfied because the food seemed a bit mediocre... I felt that it just didn't compare to other Japanese restaurants (even though the owner offered great hospitality and I wanted to like the food as much as I liked the service).

HOWEVER, that was last march. My opinion on the restaurant has changed since then. I remember having Japanese takeout at a friend's house in the neighborhood a few months ago and thinking \"Wow! The sushi tastes so good and the seaweed salad is amazing!\" and honestly, I was pleasantly surprised when they told me it was Qi Sushi.

I'm really glad that their food quality improved - it's so nice to have such a convenient little spot to eat at in the neighborhood. They offer you a lot of food too! They're really generous in portions and I highly suggest getting the sushi combos because it fills you right up. It's a nice cozy spot to be at with your friends, even though the restaurant is pretty small.

When I was there, a lot of people was coming in to get take out.  So you can tell this place is gaining a lot of popularity with the locals.

Overall, I think people (like me) shouldn't be quick to judge newer restaurants  because there's always room for improvement. When the waiter comes by and asks you how you like the food, the best thing to do is to be honest and give constructive criticism so they can make better changes (if they have to).

But anywho, you're getting good value for your money. I say give this place a chance! I think you'll like it."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good sushi, this is the place! Don't be fooled by its simplicity, you will eat the best sushi in town here and for a fantastic price! My family and I come here all the time! We love the salmon chirashi! It's marvellous!"}
{"text":"Being hungry in Regent Park isn't ideal. There are plenty of quick and cheap options, but selections for the choosy are far and few between. After a disappointing hour being ignored at Sukho Thai, we whipped out the Yelp app in search of a better life.

Qi Sushi is a little restaurant that seats no more than 30. It's brightly lit with lime green walls. Being six weeks old, the restaurant was new and shiny -- and we were the only ones there. The menu offers a generous selection of apps, rolls, bento boxes, \"special\" rolls, and udon. Me and my Dining Companion (DC) both wanted bento boxes so I opted for the beef galbi bento for $10. It was unavailable (reasons unknown) so I opted for chicken teriyaki instead. The DC got the shrimp and veggie tempura in her bento. 

It was OK. I enjoyed my dumplings and chicken teriyaki immensely. The deep fried tofu and shrimp tempura were kind of oily and not great. That said, it was only $8 for each our meals and with complimentary soup and tea, that's rachets up the value score quite a bit. 

I'm not likely to make a special trip out here, but certainly a decent option next time I'm in the hood.

Obligatory Title Pun: QI will, QI will, rock you.

Menu Readability: Though clearly made in MS Word, it's actually a decent layout.

Need to mention: Our waitress was really concerned about the correct orientation of our bento boxes. Also, they take debit and credit.

What this place teaches me about myself: You really can do amazing things with MS Word. Ask me how!"}
{"text":"Warning : you will become addicted to the amazing salmon 

This place has never disappointed and I go a lot"}
{"text":"This is a squeaky clean little sushi place in my hood. 

It is still fairly new, so the Qi experience wasn't without hiccups, but it is VERY reasonably priced and very generous with portion sizes. Sushi dinners come with 18 rolls and are in the $10 range. Holla!

There were 4 of us dining, and we definitely over ordered, but we managed to stuff it all in. The fish is of a high quality for the price point, and was fresh fresh fresh. The tasty highlights for me, though, were the fried tofu and edamame - I love it when places shake those suckers in coarse salt. 

The hiccups:
They aren't licensed so I couldn't get my sake fix.
One of my gyoza was still frozen in the middle, but the server just took it away and didn't bring us another order or remove it from the bill. This was actually quite awkward come to think of it.
Their tea cups aren't the traditional Japanese ones that are well insulated, just mugs without handles, so they were really hot to touch. 

This is the only sushi place that I've ever been to that was both empty and tasty. Go pay Qi a visit, Yelpers, you won't regret it... but beware the gyozas."}
