{"text":"I was in the area today for a meeting, and when lunch time came upon us, we found Tang's and decided to give it a try.  I was expecting a typical greasy, Chinese experience, but what I got was so much better.  Tang's is much like a Pei Wei, you choose the dish that you want, the type of protein, the type of rice and it is all done at the counter.  The inside is sleek and very clean, and they have one TV hanging on the wall that was tuned into Sportscenter (bonus points there).  Our food was out in a flash, and it looked divine.  My dining companion got the Chinese Chicken salad and said it was the best one she had every had.  They used a combination of different leafy lettuces, including spinach, so it felt very hearty.  It was  lightly dressed with an Asian vinaigrette and some fried won ton chips.  I opted for the orange chicken with brown rice, and I was happy to find that they don't up-charge you for brown rice like many places do.  My dish had chicken, carrots and snow peas all in a sweet & spicy orange sauce, it was excellent.  The best part was that instead of giant chunks of chicken, the chicken was cut into thin slices, making it easier to eat.  The brown rice was cooked perfectly, and was very fluffy.  We both commented as to how much we really liked Tang's, and if I am in the area around a mealtime again, I would surely go back.  As for the complaints about pricing I have seen on here, the prices are no different than Pei Wei and maybe even a bit less. (P.S. Pei Wei doesn't have \"lunch specials\" either)  The portions were quite large, neither of us could even finish, and the quality made it worth it.  My meal was only $8.01 including tax, and I am going to get a second meal out of it!"}
{"text":"New here, many years in Minnesota.  Has a few tables but I think they are working more to the take out.  A clean unassuming place with neutral colors.  A somewhat limited menu. No lunch specials.  I understand the need for pricing, but with that I feel too high is the current prices.  One orange chicken, one chow fun and one pot sticker of the crispy kind.  I believe the pot stickers were deep fired. They were decent in flavour.  Chow fun was plentiful, but lacking in nuance, or in other words bland. The noodles seemed more like a basic wide egg noodle to me. I brought it home to spiff it up.   The orange chicken was too plentiful and was spicy with a definite orange flavour with white rice.   These items were served as is, no ad on such as one would get with most lunch specials.  The young lady who took the order and brought it to us was very enthusiastic and cheerful while answering all of our questions.  I really do not know if I will be back simply because I have had better food at a lesser price.    I hope you and others try it and find it to your liking because I want everyone to succeed"}
{"text":"Patti, I give you one star for your whiney review that was not helpful at all to anyone looking for a place to eat. Sorry you lost your favorite salad but that doesn't give you the right to rate them a 1. In your own words, you never even tried the food of the new ownership, thus your review is a merely a rant and not to be taken seriously.   Anyway, don't let that lady dissuade you from checking this place out. I'm a big fan of chicken curry and I've tried it at at least 10-15 places. This one is my favorite. I'm not sure what I love about it, the right amount of curry and spices, right choice of veggies(minus the mushrooms, thanks for listing the ingredients in the menu so I could delete those...saves me picking them out!) It's simple yet tasty. They deserve a 5 star due to the fact that I've tried so many other places and none have compared. Keep in mind I haven't tried anything else on the menu, sorry I can't review those.   The crab puffs are also great. Big chunks of chives, which I like. There's a place on Estrella with better crab puffs, but Tang's has the best curry chicken in my opinion."}
{"text":"Tang's Asian Bistro is a wonderfully fresh and flavorful Neo-Asian take on popular Chinese dishes. The Tang family has created superb dishes in a quick serve and casual environment and a well designed brand. Everything is freshly prepared and fast and served hot to your table or to go. Tang's service is spot on, from the friendly greetings and smiles when you enter, to the very attentive refills and dining \"check ins\" by the owners. Keep in mind this is a family owned restaurant and each person helping you has a passion for what they do!  This is NOT your greasy stale American/Chinese flare with old fried rice and eggroll for your lunch special letter D. If you are a fan of Pei Wei Asian Bistro and their ordering model of: Choose a flavor and choose a protein you will be very familiar. Tang's has very delicious and distinct flavorings with deeper flavor profiles in comparison to PeiWei. Their portioned the same as single entrees with your choice of rice and their price points are less then PeiWei by 50cents+. (Yes I read the previous reviews and compared pricing)  Review on the food itself. Tang's has excellent seasoned woks \"wok hay\" which effervescences kisses the friend rice and each dish. The Mongolian dishes have a fresh spin from the usual flare of green onions, onion and mushroom and have crisp snap peas! I choose beef for my protein and it came out tender with the lightly caramelized Mongolian sauce. Their schezwan chicken dish actually has a delicious spice note covering the tender velveted cooked chicken. Please try them for yourself and help support a small local restaurant! We already have too much \"big brother\" restaurants on the west side."}
{"text":"I was driving around looking for a place to eat, and my wife tells me about this new restaurant called Tang's.  I made a u-turn and headed for Tang's because I love to try new things.  I went in and was greeted by a very nice American lady.  I ordered the General Tso's Chicken with fried rice.  Wow!  It was delicious.  They offer a variety of dishes, and have meals for the children too.  Their menu is on their website if you want to check it out before you go.  I ate there again today.  Tangs is my family's new favorite Asian Bistro. Friendly service, delicious food.  Goodyear needs more restaurants like this.  Update: After reading Michael L. review, I have to agree that the prices are a little high.  I like the food better than Pei Wei, so I don't mind paying a little extra on occasion.  Update: They have a new menu with lunch specials!  5 STARS!!!"}
{"text":"It's Chinese meets Bistor........ with take out!    Tangs keeps it simple, and manages to provide  HIGH quality take-out. I'm not kidding here fresh veggies, large shrimp. I mean even the Lo-Mein had freshly chopped scallions.....   You can also stop by and eat @ Tangs. Their place VERy small, but quite welcoming and fresh. All said , if you're in the area of GoodYear, and need a nice lunch or dinner take-out........ Call them!"}
{"text":"I found out about tangs by just driving by.  I checked the other reviews on yelp and figured we would give it a try.  I called the order in for \"Wok Out\", the person on the phone was very pleasant.  The portions were a nice size.  I like the option of having white or brown rice as well as fried rice for a 1$ more.  I ordered the General Tso's Chicken and my wife ordered the Sweet and Sour chicken.  The General Tso's was not as spicy as I would have liked but it was delicious. The sweet and sour was good as well.  We were both surprised at the amount of Pineapple as most restaurants only give you 1 or 2 pieces.   I also ordered fried rice and I have to say it was some of the best fried rice i have had.  It was not greasy at all like other places.  We also ordered a cup of the Egg Drop soup.  It was full of egg which is a surprise compared to other restaurants I have gone to.  Overall we were very pleased with our food and will be returning to Tangs!"}
{"text":"Best chinese food in the SW valley! CLEAN and FRESH. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials. Food is always good and fresh. Service is good and servers are very nice. Highly recommend for casual dining..."}
{"text":"Quick, fresh delicious Chinese food cooked to order.  Tang's is a family owned restaurant that does it right.   I've tried several of their dishes and each one came out absolutely delicious.  It's not like Panda Express where the food could be sitting out for hours and it's not your dirty cheap Chinese places where you wonder if the cook washes his hands and the bathrooms are nasty.    Call ahead for take out.   I'll definitely be back when I'm in this area."}
