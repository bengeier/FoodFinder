{"text":"Two of the best Chinese restaurants in Phoenix. This one serves both Cantonese and Szechuan cuisine. Since it is run by Cantonese and seems like the chef is Cantonese, I will recommend trying their authentic Cantonese cuisine (it is like Cantonese comfort food). Their Szechuan cuisine is not bad at all too. This place opens till 1 am (from 9:30 pm to 1 am they serve Cantonese charbroiled BBQ). They also have KTV rooms."}
{"text":"Food was great. The karaoke sound system is good too. It's a place you can really enjoy with a group of friends. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We came on a friday night this time around. It was pretty late and this place was the only Asian dining place open late. They have private rooms for karaoke. It took a while longer to get our food this time. I ordered the house rice noodles, spicy chicken and mixed nut chicken. The chicken was not my favorite  but I really liked the noodles."}
{"text":"My only issue with Lucky Star is that their chinese menu is so much better than the english one. When I look around and see chinese people eating something that looks tasty and then tell the waiter I want that it is never on the english menu and always good."}
{"text":"This Chinese restaurant is relatively new so it is pretty clean. The food was also delicious from spicy chicken to roasted buns. The food we got was the spicy fish and roasted buns with vegetables. The food was spot on and delicious. Even though the food tasted good, it did not wow me to give it 5 stars. The food was delicious, but not the best."}
{"text":"Great place. Limited menu but great food. Plus karaoke!!!!  But they charge you for tea??  restaurant is open space so can be a little noisy from neighbor table."}
{"text":"I live down the street from here so if they had hit it out of the ballpark, I would be there most days of the week eating there if I could. Their English menu is meh. The best selections are on the Chinese menu. There were some guys there who were really nice and helped me out with some of the items but even the couple there that wasn't Chinese and live across the street in the complex next to the DD stopped eating at their table and asked for their food to go because the atmosphere is very like you can come in and eat but if you're not Chinese, what are you doing here? Maybe the next time my cousin Dominique who went to Sidwell Friends outside of Wash DC comes for a visit I'll bring her there since she's fluent in Chinese but then again Domi doesn't like when folks behave that way around her and she's fluent in 6 languages ( Span., Fr., Jpn., Chn.,Kor.,Ita.) Get the menu in Chinese translated into English and be a little more welcoming of your neighbors. The food was ok-chef a little heavy handed on spicy when asked not to be and not enough or other dish. First time in here-great location if they could just work on being more friendly and understanding of non-Chinese customers. Also fellow Yelpers: If you're taking pics for your review please note whether on Chinese menu and the item in Chinese and English please. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE place to Get authentic Chinese food in the whole valley. I am a regular here and the entire staff treated me like family from the first time that I visited. Every single dish is insanely delicious. As I was told by my waiter my first visit this is very traditional and authentic Chinese food. I would highly recommend trying there more Chinese traditional dishes that you may have never heard of as it is amazing to experience the culture they are bringing to the valley! Super thankful for the entire team and everyone on their staff for feeding me on the regular!! :)"}
{"text":"Great place for Cantonese and Szechuan cuisine that you won't get at your Americanized restaurant. If your looking for adventure and something new try this place. Unfortunately, I'm sure the food is amazing earlier in the day but when we went our chow main noodles were very touch and the rice was dry and crispy. The service wasn't that great. We waited forever to get refills on our drink and the waiter was very unfriendly when he dropped food off at our table. The waitress made sure we tipped her by circling the gratuity standards in the receipt. Ok food and need for improvement on the wait staff."}
{"text":"Great, authentic Chinese at a reasonable price. Each dish is made with passion and you can taste it. The staff was wonderful and very attentive. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about this place when I heard they are mixed business with restaurant and karaoke. Not only this, but the the food style is combining Cantonese and Sichuan styles.  However, the food is pretty good. It's more like a 3 and half stars, but I was so impressed by the boiled pepper fish. The menu is a little bit limited and the one they give us only has Chinese. LOL They owner said they are formalizing their menu, so hopefully they will get something more completed."}
{"text":"Pros: -genuinely authentic Chinese food -very clean interior including bathrooms -accommodating service, waitress was very nice -good taste for the most part  Cons: -don't even know what the restaurant is called because it is not written in English -they didn't take the time to make menus in English  -bad portions (for the high price)-the dish we got had barely any meat, it was pretty much 30% meat and 70% vegetables.  Came here on a whim because my brother was curious. We usually go to Papaya Thai in the same plaza for Asian food but we wanted something new. We enjoyed the food despite the lack of meat in our dish, but we will definitely be back to try more. Hopefully they will have a website and an English menu and English sign up by then. This would help the business because it would be more inviting to Caucasian customers as well and not so confusing."}
{"text":"I like this place. We've eaten there twice and enjoyed our meals. The service was great and the beer is cold."}
{"text":"I know that there is the English and a Chinese menu, I highly suggest having an authentic English translated Chinese menu....  Must be good though, we're the only English speaking Asians here..  We got the fish and beef with light spice level. Didn't tell me it was bathe in chili oil. The lack of translating strikes again..."}
{"text":"What a great spot for lunch. Tempe needs this! Yelpers show your love for this hidden gem.   Authentic Chinese cuisine at Its best. Clean environment, quick service and best of all you get a big bang for your buck. Cant wait to come back soon"}
{"text":"4.5/5  (Cue Lucky Star music) You must be my lucky star 'Cause you have legit Chinese food with a karaoke bar --Madonna after eating their seafood tofu hot pot   The menu here is a mix of Cantonese, Sichuan, and Americanized Chinese dishes. It's nice that the items on the menu are separated by region/style. They also offer a good selection of beverages and desserts.   I spied on the menu something called Devil's milk tea. I was feeling in a Devilish mood so I figured I'd try it. I wondered what could make it so devilish. Is it spicy? It is bright red? Will I have to sign some documents to drink this tea in exchange for my soul? Turns out, it's basically milk tea in a skull glass. The milk tea itself was decent, a good balance of creaminess, tea flavor, and lightly sweet. I did get a kick out of drinking something out of a skull though!  We shared three dishes: lotus root with mixed vegetables, beef with bitter melon and seafood tofu hot pot. The lotus root with mixed vegetables were perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The beef with bitter melon was a great rendition of this dish. Normally bitter melon is too bitter for me but in this case it was mild enough for me to eat. The beef was very tender and a plentiful amount.  As for the seafood tofu hot pot, I loved this dish! It came piping hot, with very tender calamari, snow peas, mussels, scallops, imitation crab, mushroom, tofu and shrimp. It's one of the best versions I've had in some time.  This place is open late and has private karaoke rooms which is another cool perk. I'd definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"Do you like authentic Chinese foods and signing along with bunch friends? This is the newest karaoke style Chinese restaurant in town. We (21 people - see photo) had a wonderful time here. The karaoke room are clean and nice.   The staff are super friendly and treat our group very kindly. The foods are very good. You can tell that they put their heart and soul into the dishes. It's definitely a great place to hang out with friend till late nigh."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience I've had at an establishment in years. I waited 50 minutes for take out. That's right, take out. I got in, ordered, and sat there for half an hour before I got fed up and asked a server how much longer it was going to take. The \"boss\" interrupted the server and said they were just waiting on the soup. I have never been to a restaurant where I had to wait on won ton soup, but whatever. 20 minutes go by and my order finally comes out. 20 minutes for soup? Yeah no. I was sitting right in front of the \"boss\" the whole time and instead of checking to make sure my order was being prepared, him and his workers were goofing around laughing the whole time. I ordered 2 things and a soup, and it took 50 minutes. This place was NOT busy either, and now I can see why. Like I said, worse service I have gotten in years, and this was just take out. And not to mention, the food was terrible. I figured if the food was good, at least it would've been worth the wait, but nope. I have no idea why this place is rated so high, Panda Express would've been a better experience."}
{"text":"I have frequented this place since moving to Arizona, as finding good Chinese food is definitely more difficult here than in my native California. I have always been pleased coming to Lucky Star, and I encourage everybody to not be discouraged by some of these low-star views that complain about customer service.  It is unquestionable that there are language barriers here. Dining at this restaurant requires some awareness in that field, but not so much that your dining experience should be ruined. Here's how I'd go about it:   What Lucky Star needs to work on is timing when they bring the food out. It's true as one of the reviewers said: appetizers come out shortly before your entrees do, as opposed to an adequate amount of time to enjoy things individually. On that note, I'd also recommend NOT getting their potstickers until they redesign that appetizer (you only get 3 -- my party found that kind of funny when we were last there). Unrelated, but there should be no extra charge for tea! That to me is just some silly nonsense.   That aside, once the food does come out, you will not be disappointed. I have enjoyed everything I've ordered from Lucky Star, including their orange chicken, won ton noodle soup (my personal favorite), jumbo shrimp and scrambled eggs, chow mein, and a great many other items. Give them a chance and explore their wide variety of items on the menu. It's worth the potential annoyances from the linguistic disconnects between you and the servers."}
{"text":"After a Kenny Chesney concert on Saturday, June 23rd, at 1130pm the husband and I were hungry but didn't want the usual fast food options. I yelped chinese restaurants opened near me and this place came up. We are so glad it did, seriously the best Asian food I've had! We ordered Mongolian beef, orange chicken and twice cooked pork and started with the crab puffs, spring rolls and potstickers. Everything was amazing. The twice cooked pork had amazing texture and flavor and some kind of mushroom that I've never had and it was so delicious, I picked them all out and ate them 1st. The orange chicken was the best orange chicken I've ever had and my husband ate every bite of the beef. I'm not a crab puff person, but my hisband is so we ordered them and they were so good. I highly recommend this place, big, clean, well lit, great customer service and prices and the food is beyond amazing."}
{"text":"We stopped by on a whim craving Asian food. This place was open so we gave it a shot. We ordered the orange chicken. It was served with rice and the greenest broccoli I've seen in a while. Food was delicious service was also great, prices were reasonable and bathrooms? were clean."}
{"text":"Horrible worse service. Our waiter came back to inform me that they ran out of what I ordered. I'm still looking at the menu when my dinner date gets his entree!!!  And if you order an appetizer don't expect to receive it first. Oh and if your meal comes with rice don't expect to receive it with your meal either.  Don't bother telling the waiters your concerns because they fall on deaf ears.  Never again."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks great. Looks, because we were given an English menu with less than half the items that everyone else was eating. It was quite embarrassing.  They have a Chinese menu and an English menu. The English menu is American Chinese food.  Typical items like orange chicken, Kung pao chicken, etc...yet, as you look around other tables, they had other options which looked delicious. It's kind of like they are assuming we won't like the other options therefore they don't offer it. Like I said I was just disappointed that we didn't have access to the other dishes. And again, it was pretty embarrassing to have them hand us an American Chinese menu thinking that's only what we want to try.  I recommended translating you whole menu because there are curious taste buds out there."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW! I will probably be back next week because I see future me craving diced spicy chicken! It's dry (as in no sauce) but full of flavor with a tiny bit of spice. I read some reviews that found the non American menu too spicy... my meal was wonderful (under SzeChuan). I was not on fire but then again I have a pretty high spice tolerance. Service was also so friendly and the food came out very quickly. My new go to for Asian dining! I read some reviews how their orders took forever but mine took give or take 10 minutes and I walked in to order since I couldn't find full menu online. I also read online that the english menu was too small... I was handed a full menu that had Chinese and English. They had A LOT of options. They are also open late!!!"}
