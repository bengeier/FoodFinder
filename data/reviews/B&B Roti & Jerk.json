{"text":"B&B is a West Indian restaurant.  More of a dine out spot than a dine in spot as there are only 2 or 3 tables at the front of the shop.  These guys are known for their doubles.  To make them even tastier, ask for the mango chutney when they are building the greasy chick pea bundles of joy.  This place is a bit divey.  Lets just say if I had seen the shop before eating the doubles, I probably wouldn't have eaten anything from here.  That being said, each time I go back, it seems to get less divey (or maybe it is the rose coloured doubles glasses I get).  B&B is owned by an older, very friendly couple and they make everything on site.  This place attracts a lot of repeat customers.  Lets put it this way, if I say at work I am going to get doubles, the word spreads fast and people want to place orders.    The price is crazy cheap.  You can get 2 doubles and 2 potato balls for $4.75 (including tax).  I have seen people line up for their roti, which I haven't tried as of yet.  Their beef patties are okay, nothing fantastic.  Better than Patty King but not as good as Tastee's."}
{"text":"After craving roti, I decided to stop by B&B Roti and Jerk. Just east of McCowan and Steeles, this small little restaurant is tucked into this little plaza (by small I mean you can barely fit a group of people in here). A friend of mine recommended this place and it's a little on the expensive side for roti but the portions make up for it!  I ordered two of them and it was so good, I'd continue eating them non-stop if I could. It cost around $30-$35 and parking is limited because it's a small plaza but you should be able to find a spot no problem.  If you're in the mood for Indian food, you won't be disappointed if you come here!  4/5"}
