{"text":"Great small restaurant.  We came right before close (sorry about that) but food and service was great. Can not wait to come back. Tacos are great with the salsa Verde and the red spicy salsa. Wish you guys has margaritas though!"}
{"text":"We came here within the first week of them being open, so the third star was given in hopes that they will get their kinks figured out.

We were immediately off to a rocky start as the server came to our table, handed us our menus and then just stared at us. After a few awkward moments we asked for waters and if they had margaritas, to which the reply was no, but they just opened and were still figuring things out. 

When we were ready to order our food, we asked if they had queso, to which the replay was, no, but they just opened and were still trying to figure things out. We ordered our food and then asked if they had chips and salsa. The response was, \"Oh, did you want some?\" Yes. Please. And as another reviewer stated, we were charged for an additional basket. Apparently one is all that's allotted for a 4-top.

We all got the mini taco sampler which was ok. We collectively agreed that all were pretty flavorless, except the steak, which was really good.

Our food had been cleared and we sat for a while as the server continued to walk past our table. We finally stopped her and asked for the bill, and she told us we needed to go up front to pay. Which is fine, if we had ever been told such.

My overall impression after leaving was that they rushed to get their doors."}
{"text":"Wow!! All I can say is wow!! I'm so glad we found this restaurant right here in Fitchburg.  Awesome service to boot."}
{"text":"Best place for Mexican food, hands down! The food carries a very authentic taste, I definitely recommend trying the Tapatio Taco with pastor and the grilled shrimp taco, they're super delicious! Also, the shrimp cocktail is pretty great too! The owners really put a lot of work into the restaurant design and their staff was really friendly, I recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"So glad we stopped in here for lunch! Authentic and delicious! We had tacos, sopes, burritos, and beans and rice. The pastor tacos and sopes with fresh salsas were the highlight but it was ALL good! We will be back soon as I'm sure this will be a new favorite place for us."}
{"text":"Maybe we caught them on a bad day, but this is nothing to write home about. Chips were stale, guacamole is obviously store-bought/pre-packaged, definitely not fresh nor homemade. Entree was edible at best. Don't know how they have so many 4 and 5 star reviews after not even being open a year."}
{"text":"Wow!  Just enjoyed lunch here.  Super friendly staff and the food was so fresh and delicious!  Can't wait to go back again.  I had the taco sampler and side of guacamole.  Ummmm I think I want more guacamole....like right now!  That was amazingly good!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food by people who know how to cook. If you've eaten at their food cart, Cali Fresh, you know they understand how to use ingredients to enhance flavors in ways that are creative and flavorful.  That tradition of excellence continues here at Tapatios.  We tried the tacos, quesadillas and Sopes, and all were served hot, fresh and tasted great.  The salsa and guacamole are homemade and are served with warm homemade chips. Not something poured out of a bag or jar. If you're looking for well cooked affordable food look no further."}
{"text":"Workers are very friendly. Nice to have a vegan option. Vegan Tacos were good but guac or a cashew crema would have taken them to the next level. Beans tasted homemade but could have been a little hotter. Rice was simple but tasty and seasoned right."}
{"text":"So good! I ordered the tacos (pastor and shrimp) and my husband ordered the sope. Delicious. Generous portions. Great prices. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I want to cry!  I have had a lot of straight up disgusting Mexican food in Madison and it's hard to find places with salsa that is actually spicy. 

We ordered the taco sampler, asada sopes and a side of cebollitas (grilled green onions). The cebollitas were sold out, but they grilled some onions for us on the house which hit the spot. Other reviewers saying the tacos are flavorless don't understand Mexican cuisine and how you need to layer flavors by adding toppings. The taco is just a canvas. Both the mild and spicy salsa were very flavorful and different. The sope was definitely handmade and freshly fried. It was soft and light, not dense and had cheese melted onto it. It was also pretty big (about 5 inches across). The whole meal was made sweeter by their special which was a guava empanada with cream cheese and a side of ice cream. It was perfect and reminded me of my mom's empanadas. I don't know what it is about Mexican moms and adding cream cheese to deserts, but they know what they're doing! 

The horchata was a little watery. No, this place does not serve margaritas, but it is a restaurant, not a bar, so that shouldn't deter you. And a note about any Mexican restaurant that is not made to be eaten at 2:00 am when you're drunk: most real Mexican places do not include rice and beans as a side and the menu here clearly does not state that sides are included. 

The service was TOP NOTCH and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Chips are homemade and very tasty. Salsa covers all levels of spicy and have unique flavors. Very friendly service and lots of variety on the menu. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Happy to have a very solid Mexican option in Fitchburg. We went just after they opened, and everything was solid to above average. We got the mini-taco sampler and the special crispy shrimp tacos. Every one of the meats was seasoned very well, and the crispy tacos were something new for me, and I dug it! 

The salsa that comes with the complimentary chips is incredibly fresh, and tastes great. They have a good verde salsa that you can get with your meals as well. 

One drawback is no margaritas yet! Only beer so far, but they are hoping to add those soon. Definitely a place that will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in for lunch and walked away a happy customer.  Located in a strip mall, the restaurant has a number of tables and booths to sit at and decorated with a Baja California feel.  Decorated in brick and wood, it is a warm and inviting place to grab a bite.  I went with 3 tacos-Carnitas, Campechano and the El Tapatio (with avocado and cheese) all topped with onion, cilantro, and cabbage.  All were delicious and the ingredients chopped very fine to get a complete taste with each bite.  To accompany the tacos, there are two house made sauces that were both excellent.  The only negative is that the corn tortillas were not made in house.   Table service was fast and attentive.  Take note, while there is a server, pay the cashier once you have the bill.
I'm not in Fitchburg often but I wouldn't hesitate coming back and trying more of their delicious food."}
{"text":"Some of the issues may have to do with the fact that they are new, but some certainly are not. We had a part of three that each ordered different tacos and a chimichanga. No one was impress by any of their tacos. The chimichanga was ok, but the pastor was either just pork, or the pastor was not well done. Al Pastor is how I rate and define good Mexican, so you can see part of the knock there. 

Kicker was they seems to want to nickel and dime you. First bracket of chips is free, but then they charge you for more. So if the three of us sat at different tables we would get three baskets?  After we ordered the server came back and asked if we wanted rice or beans, the same way they came back and asked if we wanted spicy salsa. One of our party said he would have rice. Unknowingly he was charged $2 for about 2 spoons full of rice. 

On a positive note their salsas were very good. 

Much better authentic Mexican in Madison area."}
{"text":"I finally found a place for good Mexican food in the Madison area. There are so many options available, even vegan which is extremely difficult to come by. I am so happy to come across this place. The restaurant is family owned and they are extremely friendly. The inside decor is very lovely as well. Very clean and organized place, super good ambiance and environment. I love everything about this place."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food. Lots of options. I enjoyed the carne asada the most. They have a chef pick 5 mini tacos if you want to be adventurous. The sauces they give with your meal are spicy and delicious. They do provide one free order of chips and salsa as well"}
{"text":"Awesome service, Food, Location. Super fresh sorry about the guacamole picture. Didn't last long enough to get a picture"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I got the cocktail and taco sampler. Everything was great. I was very impressed with the cocktail as it was the perfect mix for the sauce. Most places around here it's watery and just over powered by the k-up flavor. This was great. Good thickness for the sauce, nice mix of avocado, onion, cucumber, tomatoes, and cilantro. I'll be back for this. 
I tried the taco sampler because it was lunch time and I was ordering the cocktail as well. So I wanted to try as much as I could on my first trip here. Yes, I will be coming back. 
Everything was amazing and fresh."}
{"text":"The restaurant overall is lovely. The decorations were beautiful and whoever designed it paid attention to even the littlest details - it's beautiful people! The ladies who were working were all so kind and attentive - we were seated right away and the first thing I noticed was the different hot sauces available. Usually hard to find a place that will serve Cholula, Valentina AND Tapatio [it's usually one, the other or none]. 

As for the food, we ordered tacos, a burrito and a horchata. The crisp on the tortillas was a surprised - the tortillas were thick enough that we would have preferred just one per taco. The meat overall could have used some more seasoning but the delicious salsa made up for the overall taste. The burrito was pretty tasty - it wasn't as jammed packed as most burritos are, so I was a little disappointed. As for the horchata, it was a little watered down, but we were there at the end of the night, so I'm going to attribute the taste to that. 

Overall, the staff was great and a lovely environment. I'm willing to come back and try it again!     

*SIDENOTE: this is next to Anytime Fitness and SoHo 2990 Cahill Main St. 100. The Yelp map took me to condos on Caddis Bend."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos! Delicious! So flavorful and filling, with plenty of meat and toppings. I was afraid to put one down once I started, since it would fall all over. The grilled shrimp were particularly good, with distinct flavor. Topped with cabbage and chipotle mayo, I have a new favorite lunch. I like that they put two tortillas on the taco, to balance the fillings, and that they were slightly crisp around the edges, for nice contrast. 

The only disappointment in my takeout order was the $4 guacamole, which came in a small plastic cup and was more tomato than avocado. I won't get that again, since it's not worth the price if you actually want avocado chunks and flavor. 

Service was very friendly and helpful. I hope they get a website up soon, so I can check out the menu in more detail. There wasn't enough time (with people waiting behind me) for me to read every item, and I'm sure there's more I want to try, particularly from the 6-8 different types of tacos ($2.75-$3.50 each)."}
{"text":"Cute new restaurant in Fitchburg. I was very excited to see that there was a new Mexican restaurant so close to were I lived. My expectations were absolutely met at this restaurant. 

All the food that we had while dining here tasted very fresh. They start you off with complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were still warm from the fryer and the salsa was very fresh tasting. 

I ordered the a burrito with chicken in it. Overall it was what a burrito should be. Hearty and filling while leaving you feeling a little guilty you just ate that much food. With your food you get a mild green salsa and a hot orange salsa. Both were awesome, the hot sauce hit the spot. 

I am excited to come back and try some of there other options with this being so close to home."}
{"text":"So glad they are in Fitchburg/Madison!  My wife and I went there last night. The service was prompt and very friendly. The salsa was some of the best and freshest I have had- definitely homemade.  We both had the taco sampler. So fresh and tasty and only $8.25/each for five tacos. Looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants in town. The server was amazing and very helpful. They have multiple types of taco toppings. We will definitely return for more. Thanks."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner tonight. The menu is small but there was enough variety to give this vegetarian a few options to choose from! 

The free chips and salsa, were really good! The salsa was fresh and light enough to make it the perfect starter. 

We opted for a second appetizer... because why not. The cheese dip was not my favorite but my boyfriend really liked it. It was a little runny for my liking. 

My vegan taco was the perfect size and very flavorful. The vegetarian sopa was probably my least favorite. But, by the time I was eating the sopa, I was full and satisfied! 

Finally, a fun spot in Fitchburg for a nice, quick meal."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my wife, kids and mother-in-law after the reviews I found on Yelp. My wife and I had the weekend special (torta ahogadas). So I'm not sure if it was just a fluke but the bread of the torta was soggy and the meat and stuff inside was lukewarm. Not super impressed. However! The chips are salsa very tasty. The atmosphere and decor were spot on and the staff were friendly and treated the kids well. I may have to try the taco sampler next time I visit."}
{"text":"I've had almost everything on the menu and this has to be one of the most authentic Mexican restaurants in town! The shrimp cocktail, tacos, burritos, and tortas are great but the dish that stands out is the sopes! You might have had a sope at one of the many restaurants in town but the sopes at Tapatios are simply the best! Also the aguas frescas( horchata, Jamaica) have that home made taste to it unlike the thicker overly sweet stuff you might find at other places definitely a house made horchata which is almost impossible to find. Now just need to try the weekend menu"}
{"text":"I was really excited to have Tapatios join the limited list of Fitchburg restaurants. We need more! 

When it comes to taco places, I look for something crave-able! For my first time, I got the the taco sampler that comes with 5 mini tacos chosen by the chef. First, this meal was presented as an entree, but you might find it more sizable as an appetizer; for me, I was just right. 

The 5 tacos for me included the shrimp, steak, pastor, chicken and chorizo. The shrimp was average with a little too much sauce for my taste. The steak was the blandest of them all. The pastor was the star and absolutely crave-able (I shouldn't have started with this one)! The chicken was surprising as I usually find these to be dry at most taco places. Finally, the chorizo was good on flavor, but what I loved the most was that it wasn't soppy like most chorizos can be.

I'll probably go back, because it's so close, but if I have the energy for driving the few extra minute, I'd just stick to my favs, Taqueria Guadalajara."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California and if you are from there then you need to come eat here. THE BEST TACOS EVER. The meat is tender and juicy! I recommend Tapatío Tacos El Pastor"}
