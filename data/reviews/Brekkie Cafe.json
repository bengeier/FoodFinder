{"text":"My husband and I just discovered this cute new brunch spot Thursday. The decor is very new and modern.The food was good, the eggs benedict's were very tasty, but a bit expensive.  The downside was that our meals took a long time to come out. However, the service helped make up for this. Our server, Nathan, was very attentive and polite, his recommendations were excellent and he made sure our coffees were full the entire time while we waited! We will be back."}
{"text":"Built on location of the old ace diner. It's a good setup there. Feels comfortable and well laid out. Had pineapple avocado and bacon toast. Very good. Ordered side of eggs too. This MOG ( man for girth) needed a little more breakfast than one order. Will order two next time. I think they are going to do well. Glad to have a breakfast location back in neighbourhood again too!"}
