{"text":"Amazing food!!!! Their tzatziki sauce is amazing and so it their pita bread.  Very yummy all around, whatever you pick off the menu! We keep on getting lunches for everyone at my work for awhile now (since the 1st week they opened) and we all LOVE it."}
{"text":"Best Gyro in Riverdale hands down! Great friendly staff and always a healthy portion for those who walk in looking for a tasty lunch or snack.
Fast becoming my Friday afternoon lunch routine and sure everyone who tries this spot will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try after passing by it a few times. They seem to be quite busy for take out/pick up. There were quite a few people coming in and out while we were seated. 
The meal for 2 was around $35. The service was great. The two people working (who seem to be the owners) were quite friendly. 
The food was ok. We got the pork gyro dinner plate and the chicken gyro dinner plate. As we waited she brought over some warm pitas and tzatziki to start. The tzatziki was really good! When the food came, it looked really good. They were generous portions. Both gyros tasted great. The only downfall was the rice and salad. The rice was cold and soggy...which I assume was because it was next to the over-dressed salad. The dressing had definitely seeped into the rice... 
Overall, we would definitely come back again. However, next time we will try the gyro pita wraps instead."}
{"text":"Came here around lunch for some take out.

Pros:

- Seating area
- Tastes good

Cons:
- A little pricey considering messini is a close by with lower prices."}
{"text":"Great experience. Very clean, fresh ingredients and friendly staff who take pride in their operation. Enjoyed it throughly and will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Checked out Gyro Bar! as it was too hot and humid to cook tonight. Gyro Bar! is located just off the main Danforth Avenue strip - the space is clean and has plenty of indoor seating as well as a couple of tables outside. I grabbed a lamb kebab in a pita. I got everything on it - tzatziki, onions, tomatoes and French fries. The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious, the pita was soft and fluffy and the lamb was tender and had a nice spice to it. The only \"downside\" is that the orders do take about 10 minutes to prepare - so order ahead if you're in a rush. I didn't mind waiting though, the staff were pretty friendly to talk to. Definitely will be back soon as the food was good quality and a good price."}
{"text":"I finally dropped in after driving by several times.  It seemed a little disappointing.  

The service was great, the place looked nice and was very clean.  

The Gyros were bland pretty tasteless.   It needed something like tahini sauce, or tabbouleh and maybe some hot sauce.  They had Tabasco but that usually doesn't do the trick.  

Not as good as Messini's on Danforth.  

Too bad, always on the lookout for some hidden gems.  This one didn't quite deliver on the food taste."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. The fries were not cooked at a high enough temperature so they were very soggy and undercooked and made the gyro disgusting. Probably will not go back if you don't care enough to cook simple fries properly makes me wonder about the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I just bought two sandwiches pork GyroThey're dry tasteless. The place is empty. Probably because of the food being so bad. I predict they close in 6 to 8 weeks. I also predict deli world will be opening in there the best corn beef in the city Toronto. Just figured out why the Gyro was so bitter . To Zieke sauce was made sometime last week should be made daily cucumber in to Zieke sauce should be crunchy but if it was made last week it has bled its juices into the sour cream and yoghurt and made very bitter . Plus the meet was tasteless dry and tough . I give it six To eight weeks depending how much money they wanna throw away"}
