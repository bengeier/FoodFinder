{"text":"Always drove past and finally decided to give it a try.... the reviews didn't excite me...but I thought I should see for myself.  The patty was dry, stale and didn't have much flavor. The jerk chicken meal tasted like steamed chicken.  It was tasteless. There wasn't even any skin on the meat. It was almost as if they ran out of jerk seasoning and decided to mix the remainder of the sauce with water to stretch it .. from now on I will stick to what the reviews state!"}
{"text":"Big tingz really a gwan at Nicey's Eatery! Prime Location, beats all the other Caribbean places I've been to. Real Island taste! The staff are really welcoming and the service is 10/10  Food 100/10 You have to try everything on the menu at least once!  BIG UP NICEYS! REAL YAADIE DIS A COME FROM! DI FRY CHICKEN SELL OFF!!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointing, they charge for coleslaw and gravy which comes standard at every other Caribbean restaurant. I got fried chicken which tasted like it was coated with Shake 'n Bake. Rice was dry and not edible. I ended up eating the chicken and throwing out the rest of the meal. The beef patty was good, but those are Michidean pattys, which are always good. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great Caribbean cuisine, tasty and authentic. The best part is the service! Super friendly and polite. Dine in or take out. You get healthy portions and a good price. I've already been back twice. It is now in my regular rotation, cus I can't get enough and keep remembering how good it tastes!"}
{"text":"Decent portions of meaty oxtail, though I found it a bit bland.  Not a big fan of the jerk pork or chicken either, which I found to be on the dry side and less than flavourful than expected, but my dining companions enjoyed the pork and said it was the better pick between the two.  My pick would go to the ackee & saltfish, which had a buttery, creamy mouthfeel, and wasn't overly salty.  Each meal came with two slices of plantain (you can order an additional 5 pieces for $1.90, which I did!), and your choice of starchy side - like a large scoop of rice & beans.   It was...nice-ish."}
{"text":"A true Caribbean taste. Finally a place that is away from the generic sauce in rotis. Clean establishment with a helpful staff. A huge selection for every taste. I will be sure to return again and again!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and always greeted with super friendly faces. I come here very often and they yet to disappoint!  I often have problems choosing what to eat since everything is really good. Nothing warms you up on a cold winter day like a nice bowl of soup!  I highly recommend Nicey's to anyone looking for authentic Jamaican food!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get. You're better off going to Tastee !   Ordered a jerk pork meal. Nice big chunks of pork but dry like cardboard. Eating it was a struggle. I couldn't even cut it with a knife.   Rice and peas were dry as well. Definitely need water nearby to consume the meal. 2* for cleanliness.   Would never go again."}
{"text":"\"Jerk chicken sanwich mi want...extra spicy...blessings!\"  Tucked away in a strip mall in Markham and Finch is one of the cleanest and coziest carribbean restaurant I have been to. I know the VP and finch location but this one is far more improved. With dine in on plates available and a much larger variety of soups. I decided to get a sandwich in order to eat light.  Ordered the jerk chicken sandwich and it was amazing. Nice chunks of chicken in pepper sauce and creamy coleslaw. I was blown away. The taste followed me on my way back to work. It was so flavorful  One of the best $5 I spent. Must try!"}
{"text":"Definitely good eats! Affordable and delicious, this is THE place to get your Caribbean fixes. Although stock seems to run low, which is a good indicator of their popularity, I would recommend not come at the end of day. Service staff definitely has that Caribbean vibe, chill and friendly.   The star of the show is definitely the food. Vibrant in both flavor and colour, it aimed to impress. Easily the most memorable Caribbean food I've had. We ordered the jerk chicken dinner, an ox tail dinner, and fried chicken...we wanted the cow feet but they ran out upon ordering. The meats were tender and well-seasoned. The Ox tail was fall off the bone finger licking good. If you want their pepper sauce, remember to ask - it's comes with the meal but not included unless customers specify. The fried plantains added a tarty sweetness that contrasted to the savory meal. The rice and beans was well cooked, though I wasn't a fan of the coleslaw.  I was less impressed with the fried chicken as it was bland and wasn't as crispy as I would've liked. 2/3 ain't too bad. The gravy, that glorious fatty, meaty goodness, was an added bonus. I ordered an extra side of gravy as I am a saucy person...in so many ways. The gravy was beyond words, sporting ACTUAL chunks of meat and fat (Yes, FAT pieces); it was worth every pound gained.   We will definitely be back to add a couple more unneeded inches to our waist!"}
{"text":"Best Caribbean meal I've ever had. It was sooo delicious that I had to order extra to takeout for later. I especially liked the saltfish fritters, fried plantain and the oxtail! Will definitely come back to try some of the other stuff!"}
{"text":"Nope. It is a bright clean place but that's about it. The food is ok, but it is expensive for dry jerk chicken with even dryer rice and peas. I mean......i have had some great jerk chicken, and maybe they'll charge you extra if you want extra sauce on the side or something, but that was just silly to charge for some on your $12 dish. It's one of those places where you pay extra for everything that comes standard at any other place. 4 of us ate there and paid $70. Never again. Maybe if the food was great I would pay that but for what you get no way!  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the beef patty was good."}
{"text":"This place is everything you'd expect from a West Indian Restaurant. Great Food, Vibrant atmosphere and a cashier that wont give up the oxtail gravy even when you believe you will get some extra.  All jokes aside fall off the bone tender, juicy and poppingly flavourful oxtail. Perfectly cooked Rice and Peas(\"Beans\" for the Non-Caribbean folk) and refreshing coleslaw to finish it all off.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Had  their daily soup that was chicken it was ok but portion was small for 4.50 .. also had shrimp roti a new menu item was so salty could not finish it .. what a waste"}
{"text":"This is a great Jamaican eatery and is their new location which has table seating. I've been to their takeout location several times in the past so I was only expecting good things. I was not disappointed.  We visited for lunch today and ordered Red Pea Soup, Jerk Chicken with Rice and Peas, and Boneless Curry Chicken Roti. The soup was very hearty and tasty, had beef, peas, potatoes and dumplings. My wife had the Jerk Chicken which was also very good. The rice and peas were well done and topped with oxtail gravy and tasted almost creamy. Finally, the Roti was good and the curry chicken was loaded with flavour. Everything had a little kick to it but not very spicy by any means. I imagine you can ask for sauce if you wanted to kick it up a few notches.  If you're in the area and looking for some quality Caribbean eats definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Location & Ambiance: Nice little spot, must be nice on the patio in Summertime   Customer Service: seemingly pleasant staff. Long line up. Slow service. After waiting in line for about 15 minutes to order a goat soup, oxtail and curry goat meals, I waited an additional 20 minutes to receive my food.  Food: After awaiting about 35 minutes on food I was disappointed with how bland it was. Haven't gone back since."}
{"text":"Hey man! Hungry and want a place to chill? Head on over to Nicey's on Markham to escape it all and get a taste of Caribbean cuisine.  Seems like the Yelpers are divided in their opinion about this place; you should come and check it out for yourself. So much nicer than their branch on Morecambe Gate! They have an outdoor patio surrounded by trees and shrubbery and inside is colorful with lovely tropical wall art. Their music vacillates between island music and 70s-80s-90s music. You order at the counter and they bring your food to you. Lovely staff willing to explain the menu, or give recommendations; they even check in on you during your meal to make sure all is well.  ORDERED: - Goat roti - large with generous amounts of savory, tender goat but watch out for the bones. - Oxtail meal with rice and peas (ask for the fried plantain instead, it's more flavorful) - nice and saucy with delicious fork tender meat, a little salty but still tasty. - Sorrel drink - holy cow! It had an overpowering ginger flavor. I didn't like it at all but I hated to waste it since I only took a sip. I gave it to my friend who loved it; to each his (or her) own. - Rum cake (home made) - tasted much better than the one at their other branch, the frosting made a BIG difference.   Definitely a cool, relaxing place to enjoy some good Jamaican food."}
{"text":"This is the new flagship location of the popular Nicey's Take-Out, serving authentic Jamaican food for over 30 years. This location, however, adds a dine-in option, a patio, a drive-through pickup window, and maybe a liquor license in their future.  The decor is nice and colourful, with bamboo cladding on the front of the counters and faux-zinc around the lower walls of the dining room.   Yesterday was their soft opening so they still have a few things to work out (new staff, new POS, new menu items, bigger space, table clearing, etc.) but the food is as good as what we've come to expect from their original location. This menu is a lot bigger. There is currently no table service. Orders have to be picked up at the counter.  Popular dishes include jerk chicken, jerk pork, oxtail, curry goat, stew peas, rice and peas, patties, and more. They also have some seafood options and lighter fare. Most dishes are available in two sizes, depending on how hungry you are. I was quite happy with the curry goat and stewed chicken that I tried.  I see a lot of potential in this place. The patio is on the east side of the building so it's shielded from the late afternoon/evening sun. It seems like it would be a nice place to sit for a relaxing meal.  They're working their way towards a grand opening celebration in a few weeks but they're open for business now. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This is awesome Carribean food..I love everything I eat here. Highly recommended!!!!!!! Reminds me of home cooking"}
{"text":"Place is hard to see it's somewhat isolated in the plaza. The food is decently priced and, taste like good authentic Caribbean food. Although I feel that they could do better on portions. Most of their staff is in the kitchen with one waitress in front. The interior is well organized and clean from what I could see."}
{"text":"Basing my rating on the quality of beef patty and the ambience/decor. Will adjust when I've tried other items!  Courteous and fast service. Conveniently located at Markham and Finch. Quite busy for a Tuesday afternoon which goes to show the popularity of Niceys.  Would definitely come back to try the jerk!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Nicey's Eatery and the location looks very inciting and the staff are great. The jerk wings were great the flavoring  Of the spice blend was really good. I had the small jerk chicken dinner which also was tasty and I really liked the rice and peas. I enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I was excited to have Nicey's Eatery opening up closer to home. A restaurant with area for dine in, a patio and even a drive thru?! A larger menu with more Caribbean favourite?! But I was totally disappointed after my visit.  Food was just meh and especially for what they charge. Oxtail was bland and tasteless for $11. The 1/2 jerk chicken was all dried out and tough white meat only for $5. I request to have it dine in and all the food still serve in recyclable plastic containers. Hot sauce no where to be found (but no amount of hot sauce could have revive the Jerk Chicken).  Service was meh, but it is a takeout restaurant, so I should not expect service? I think treating your customers nicely would be a standard regardless of the scale of your business.  I don't think I would be back again..."}
