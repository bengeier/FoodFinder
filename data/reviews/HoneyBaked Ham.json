{"text":"As expected, the day before Thanksgiving, very busy. Long line. BUT don't let that discourage from going. Very fast moving line. Very organized. Friendly staff. Excellent job!"}
{"text":"My husband placed an online order for a smoked turkey breast and a pecan pie with a designated pick-up time for the day before Thanksgiving. He arrived to pick it up and there was a very long line -- no problem; he had expected that. The problem came when he finally got to the counter and gave them his order confirmation number for the turkey and the pie. They told him you couldn't reserve a pie online. Well, their system sure allows you to do so, and my husband had his printed confirmation to show them, which he did. But they rudely told him that it didn't matter. So he left without the pie he ordered a month in advance, after waiting in line longer than people who did not place orders, and after being treated rudely. What is the point of ordering ahead if they won't honor it? We won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Just order the HAM ONLY next time.  Maybe mustards.  Nothing else.  The rest was a waste of money.  The ham is about 80.00.  Try and find coupons b4 xmas."}
{"text":"Came in because of a coupon and was very satisfied with not only the service but quality of sandwich. Definitely coming back for lunch."}
{"text":"Our family was crazy busy so we decided to get our entire Thanksgiving dinner from Honey baked Ham and it was delicious. We got MacnCheese, baked apples, ham, turkey, mashed potatoes...it was all AMAZING. It is a bit more expensive than Costco or something like that but it was worth it! We were all able to relax on Thanksgiving. We pre-ordered so we didn't have to wait in a long line. We will definitely do it again!"}
{"text":"After receiving an expired product and talking to Kelly, it was very apparent that she is  unprofessional and has no sense of customer service . I will be following up with their upper management to address my concerns."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich and hot home made soup....fresh food. Perfect for lunch and coming back for Thanksgiving dinner!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location to buy ham for thanksgiving.  i asked the person behind the counter if they had any specials going and I was told, no.   I bought a bone-in half ham since we're going to have a small gathering and when I got home, found a coupon inside of the bag for $7 off the same ham that I bought. I called honeybaked ham and i was told that each store is individually owned and i need to contact the store.  i have called the store twice and they do not pick up.  smh"}
{"text":"Growing up, we always got honeybaked hams for Easter, Christmas and other holidays.  I never knew they made deli sandwiches until I visited the location in Willoughby, Ohio.  The sandwiches are amazing and I now go twice a week for lunch.  Do yourself a favor and have their club sandwich. It is my favorite and is healthier and cheaper than burgers."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Tried the Mediterranean veggie. It was amazing. Don't be afraid to go vegetarian! The kids meal lacked in size. The sandwich was eaten in three bites. Broccoli, Ham, and Cheddar soup was tasty."}
{"text":"Hands-down, best sandwiches I've had in such a while. Lovely employees, too. The older woman is very kind, and does her job brilliantly well! The younger lady has had me jealous of her vibrant hair from time to time, and is endlessly patient, and quick about everything. Fantastic place, a little pricey, but it's worth it if you're looking for a filling, healthy lunch."}
{"text":"Recently purchased a ham here. The ham was outstanding as was the young ladies customer service that rung up our purchase. What grossed me out was the group of young employees just standing behind the counter and one young man was touching and braiding another employees hair. This went on for some time. Seriously, you touch our food and other peoples hair? Didn't make me feel very confident in the cleanliness and adherence to sanitary standards in the store. Probably won't use this store in the future"}
{"text":"i went in with my niece and 2 gift cards... the girl working and the manager were very helpful.  picked the perfect ham and helped me out with the gift cards... i highly recommend this location"}
{"text":"To start with the good, the sandwich was delicious. I ordered the turkey bacon ranch and it was on par with what you can expect from a cafe deli. The turkey was savory, the bacon was crispy, the produce was chilled, and the bread was fresh. If we're going on food alone, it was a home run.  The ordering experience was another story. The young girl who initially helped me was great. She was new and seemed to not know of the processes, but she was certainly trying and I can't fault that on her. Unfortunately, her manager was not nearly as supportive. It took the young girl almost 5 minutes to drag this woman (the manager) out of her office to fix a problem on the register, and when she finally made it to the front of the counter, she didn't even say hi or acknowledge I was even standing there. There wasn't even what would closely resemble a smile on her face.  If that young lady who served me happens to be reading this, you were great and this review doesn't reflect you. I only hope that in the future your management team gives you the support you deserve."}
{"text":"Their Ham is  delicious . Service by what  appeared  to be a manager was  awful! They had a discount sign out (10$ off ham) i asked the girl when i walked in if they had 10 off any ham, she said yes and i asked for a quarter ham. She got me one and went to ring it up, another worker(maybe manager) came over did not say anything to me and told the girl  she had to delete the order and redo it the girl did and said no he wanted tye 10$ off. I looked at the sign again it said off any half ham. I asked for one of the boneless ones. Manager said it wasnt for that. The sign said ANY HALF HAM not just bone in. She was very rude about it. Customer service is awfull here."}
{"text":"I grew up with honey baked ham around the holidays and always associate it with big family meals. I didn't  realize that they also sell sandwiches and slices. It's delicious and service was great - warm and inviting!"}
{"text":"Pros: Sandwich was good. Lot's of Ham and Fresh. Good Customer service. Cons: Limited Choices in Bread. All They have is Croissants, and a Bun for White Bread Options.. But No White Plain REGULAR bread. Multi-grain/Questionable grain is all they have. Limited Choices in Sandwich meat (If you aren't a Ham fan you won't find many options besides the Roast beef)   Experience was good here. Was quite busy when we came in. Got a Carrot Cake that was WAY too sweet however.. The Cake icing was thick,full and sweet. More like a Butter Cream frosting than a Cream Cheese Frosting. More Sugary tasting than Cream Cheese.   Really disappointed by that! (The Guy said this was the Less sweet Option from the Belgian Mousse..) The Taste of the cake itself was just so-so. Not Memorable or worth buying again.  Not going to buy it again or any of their cakes but will stick to getting a Sandwich every now and then.  I can't stress it enough that this Cake is so thick ( The layer on top & the Layer in the middle between the cake)with this sweet icing that you probably won't be able to eat a full piece in one sitting. Family all agreed there was just too much icing on it.  The icing is the thing you taste more than the cake as the cake lacks flavor and they try to make up for it with this sickeningly sweet icing.  The Cake is also covered in pieces of Pecans that make a huge mess everytime you take it out of the Box..I didn't taste any pineapple in it(as listed online) or any of the very distinct spices of a typical Carrot cake. Overall 2/10"}
{"text":"Q: Why does Honeybaked Ham Co refuse to increase staff on busy holidays, dedicate a register or two to ham reservation pick ups vs. restaurant orders, or simply let us pay for the thing in advance, so we can avoid the ONE-HOUR wait in line out in the parking lot? Every single year. The wait, and the predictable lost-your-order screw ups once you make your way inside, are NOT worth a ham \"cured\" in a stew of toxic carcinogens (check out the ingredients, if you have a while free to read), hoisted on us by a national chain. My guess: to create a false impression of demand for a product that is only ho-hum (excepting the scary ingredients)."}
{"text":"Customer service skills need to be sharpened. They were condescending, and laughed at me when I had a question."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, but mostly for holiday meals. We love the boneless ham! I actually thought that I did not like baked ham until my husband insisted I try it and now I love it! We have also had their turkey breast and I have no complaints; it is very good. We have also enjoyed all of their side dishes that we have had. We will be picking up ham and or turkey for Christmas."}
{"text":"Spiral cut honey baked ham. DELICIOUS!!!!!! I could eat this ham all year long. Why wait until the holidays."}
{"text":"Yummy, this was really good!  My chefs salad was fresh and full of flavor, my turkey sandwich was so delicious I had it with creamy horseradish and some hotssauce just to kick it up a notch.  The portion is a nice size sandwich, it was my first try and I'm glad I tried it.  I'll return and I recommend this location in centennial hills."}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: I do not eat ham and I did NOT eat the ham from Honey Baked Ham (HBM). So I cannot speak to its quality, taste, or flavor.  What I can speak to is the ease of purchase.  I arrived around noon the day before Thanksgiving to grab a ham for the holiday table. There were two lines, one for people who had preordered (and presumably paid), and another for the last minutes slackers who were coming to grab a ham for the table. The winding line moved very quickly (approx. 20 minutes) and I spent my time trying to understand he size/cost options.   When I arrived to the counter, I was able to communicate with a knowledgable and surprisingly patient employee who helped me get the most bone-in ham for my money.   There are directions on the metal foil instructing you how to maximize your ham eating experience. I spent $44 for a quarter bone-in-ham and a pan of frozen rolls (don't get me started). The ham was well received and easily fed our small group with some leftovers.    I am not a fan of ham. But I am a fan of great service and responsive businesses. I like what they are doing at HBH."}
{"text":"This place is just amazing , I had tried it before with my in laws  at Christmas gatherings and it's fresh and super good .  If you trying to get ham for any special dates make sure to get there before they open because the line can get pretty crazy  and expect long waiting time.  It's a little expensive per pound but if your crazy about honey baked ham I'm sure the price is the list of your worries."}
{"text":"Every year around the holidays we celebrate with a honey baked ham, but this is the second year we've also ordered the turkey from them. Last year was so amazing, we decided not to change anything and get another one this year. We ordered about a week and a half prior to Thanksgiving and took a fully-cooked turkey home that day to keep frozen and thaw/cook on Thanksgiving. We ordered a ham and was given a day to pick it up. We went the Monday before thanksgiving and only waited about 10 minutes in line. I suggest coming early in the day to pick up your order which you should place much earlier than you think to minimize headaches. In my experience, the staff is very fast and kind and the young man who helped us on both visits was very helpful. Just make sure you don't come around 5 during rush hour cause it can get crazy, just plan accordingly.   On the off-season, the store has seating and a full menu of lunch-type options."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I only visit honey baked ham once a year right before Christmas, so when I found out that they have lunch items, I was shocked (I have never really paid attention to anything but ordering a ham). They have a variety of lunch sandwiches and salads to choose from.  I came here last week for lunch and got a basic ham sandwich...it was so good! Don't get me wrong,  I know how good their ham is but adding it to a flaky croissant and including their mustard sauce- yum! The sandwiches run about $6 leaving you satisfied and full."}
{"text":"I wish there was a grade lower than this for this total rip off place.  The week before Thanksgiving my wife and I were having her niece and family over for dinner.  What better than a real, honey baked ham, right?  We went over to the Honey Baked Ham Store in Paradise Valley on Friday and picked one up and bought three sides, mac and cheese, au gratin potatoes and baked apple slices.  The sides were a whopping $30.  The ham $56, but hey it's family coming.  When Sunday came along, we followed instructions, heated the ham and sat down to eat.  The ham was extremely dry, salty, tough and fat. Totally inedible, The sides, no better than Kraft or Marie Calender in quality and hardly enough to go around. Everybody was disappointed and couldn't wait for desert.  So, I went back with the awful ham in hand on Monday to get a refund.  Waited at least twenty minutes to speak with the manager.  He handled the refund himself, but would only give me back the $56.for the ham.  He grudgingly said he had credited us back on the the American Express card we used to pay originally.  Just got our Amex statement,  Not only didn't he credit us back at all, he charged us another $56!!!.  So we are now out over $140 for a meal no one could eat.  When I tried to talk to the manager again yesterday, some one over there said he was too busy to talk and would call us back.  And of course that never happened.  My advice.  Want a good ham and want to be really overcharged?  Go to AJ's.  At least you will get something to eat for your money."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.   Only customer in store ready to check out another customer walks in cashier decides to help new customer instead of checking me out.  Tells clerk waiting on me they have to wait mind you the new customer has not made up her mind.  10 min later they can check me out.  No sense of what customer service is. Asked to speak to manager she never came out of her office."}
{"text":"I arrived right after they opened at 7am on Christmas eve. I dont eat ham, but my fanily does. I reserved a quarter ham and smoked turkey breast. Staff was plentiful and the line moved. I had no problems using my coupons and I like how they show you the product before you decide to buy."}
{"text":"Kalvin is the greatest! Every time we come in he treats us like family. The store has a comfortable home feel. The food is so delicious. GREAT LUNCH SPOT. AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"Ordered the Ham and turkey bella.They ended up just giving me a ham sandwich.When asked where the turkey was at they claimed it was on their. Server lisa said \"Sometimes we are very busy\". Me and my mother were the only ones in there."}
{"text":"New to town and was not up for cooking thanksgiving dinner so we ordered turkey, sweet potato casserole and green bean casserole. Picked up Tuesday before thanksgiving. Line was very long, almost outside of door, but it was moving very steady. Took me about 20 min to get to the front but Bonus they had samples to try while in line!! I was a little nervous about my decision when I got the food because they were packed in mass produced freezer boxes and did not look fresh but I was not disappointed for long!  Thanksgiving feast was amazing. Turkey had great sweet crust on outside and juicy in the middle.... It was pre sliced too! We had left overs that were perfect for sandwiches the next day. Sweet potato casserole had nuts and sweet which is how I like it. Green bean casserole is the best I have ever had... Sorry mom. I plan on going back and getting another turkey soon just to have for sandwiches. Price was a little high but worth it not having to cook !!!"}
{"text":"Wow, I can't say enough positive things about this HoneyBaked Ham store.  I elected to order food for a close friend's family during a time of grieving, therefore I contacted the HoneyBaked Ham store located on Cactus.  I was treated with wonderful customer service and the trays they created were reasonable priced, well presented and greatly appreciated by the recipient family!  I would recommend this store to anyone looking for a gift or just an everyday occasion entertainment idea."}
{"text":"Bey good food. The only thing is that it's a little bit pricey for what your getting."}
{"text":"Convenient location,  nice employees, great selection. Also has a 10% military discount. Woohoo!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'd give them zero stars after today's lunch but that's not an option. Hubby and I realized that we needed to eat lunch before hitting Sam's Club. Especially Hubby, he's the King of Impulse Shopping and, at Sam's, that would mean junk in bulk!  We had two combo meal sandwiches, total cost of $19.42 (just think how many cases of licorice he could have bought for that!)  First, his... he got the chicken salad with the broccoli-bacon salad on the side. His description: \"I've had better chicken salad from the gas station, two days old and wrapped in cellophane.\" I declined his offer to have a taste. The broccoli-bacon salad was almost good, but not quite there. It was dry, and needed \"something\". Hubby ate about 1/4 of his sandwich and one taste of the salad, tossed the rest.  Now for mine, the smoked turkey breast. I had wanted to try the pasta salad but they didn't have any, so I got the potato salad. The potato salad was boring, just an average mayo covered potato salad (tossed after tasting). The turkey sandwich was the main crime. The sandwich was smoked turkey, cheese, lettuce, tomato & mayo on a bun.. along with what they called hickory honey mustard. I could only taste one thing, honey. MASSIVE amounts of honey, it was like an entire bear was dumped on there. Hubby tasted it, he gagged also.   On a plus note, the cans of Coke were fine.   The clerk had asked for our phone number when I was ordering... my  phone number?!? I asked why, the owner/manager guy said that it would use our phone number to access a database and pull our email address so they could send us coupons! I declined, horrified at this massive intrusion and misuse of data. When did it become acceptable to invade privacy like that? Never, when it regards MY life!  8/15/14 Update: Added a star for the owner's great customer service attempts.. she did everything and then some to try to make up for this. I refused her offers, because I thought the sandwich was THAT vile, but her stellar attempts are worth a star upgrade.    If she had offered to let me take all their containers of \"hickory honey mustard\" to a shooting range and promise to never allow that vile concoction back into  the store, then I might have agreed to give them a 2nd chance.  ;-)"}
{"text":"I was happy to see Margaret when I entered the store.  She makes the best Chef's Salad, one of my favorite choices at this store.  In addition to all the great food, the service here is beyond reproach.  All of the women are friendly, very helpful and knowledgeable about the products."}
{"text":"I'm trying to make lunches that I can bring to work and heat up every day. When a friend of mine posted a cheesy hashbrown casserole on Facebook a few days back, I thought that would be perfect with some good ham. So of course I thought of HoneyBaked Ham.  I went online to find the one nearest to me, and the website was offering first-time users a coupon for a free sandwich, so of course I signed up, LOL.  I stopped in today to purchase a pound of sliced ham and asked the cashier if they accepted the sandwich coupon, which they did. I asked for the Classic Ham sandwich.  While I was waiting, eight different people came in to the store (this was around 2, so it was a little surprising to me), the cash register stopped working, and the only other employee in the store apologized to the waiting customers and got someone on the phone who could get the register working again.  Amidst all that, the man who took my order brought me my sandwich and my ham slices and was very courteous (as was the other person working).  When I got home, I started eating the sandwich, and quite honestly, it was easily one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I don't go to that side of town often (I'm closer to Northlake Mall), but I will be definitely going back. While I'm trying to make lunches so I don't have to eat out, I will make an exception for HoneyBaked Ham any day. What a great sandwich and delicious ham!! And the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Very impress with the place.. smoked turkey breast off the chain. Overall i really like the place and will be coming back in the future"}
{"text":"Organized! Tuesday before Thanksgiving and it's packed but the line NEVER stops moving! Location on Cherry Rd in Rock Hill said 45min wait...not here! Sample of Turkey whole you wait yum. Helpful and informative employees. Customers sharing coupons their not going to use! Great experience A+ location"}
{"text":"I had a coupon for a $6.99 sandwich combo and stopped by here for lunch. They have a pretzel bun for a limited time so I decided to get a Tavern on it. Since I ordered the combo it came with a deli side or chips and a can of soda. The tavern had ham, turkey, bacon, cheddar, tomato, lettuce, mayo and honey mustard. So much flavor! The pretzel bun was soft and good but didn't have much pretzel flavor. I still liked the pretzel bun better than the multi-grain bread it usually comes on. I saved $2.49 on the combo with coupon. The can if soda is kept with the packaged ham so it is refreshingly ice cold.   The dude who took my order was nice and gave me a new punch card. The girl who made my sandwich went over all what comes on the sandwich and asked if I wanted anything removed. They have tables inside and plenty of their chutneys and other goodies for sale. Getting a whole ham is tradition at Easter and Thanksgiving from here and always a treat. I have not tried the sides here since my wife makes all that from scratch but around the Holidays they have good promotions that include sides. If you are not in the mood to buy a whole or mini ham... At least stop by for sandwich."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight: I am not a fan of warm ham. Thanksgiving is for turkey, not spiral-sliced. But this place is a great spot to grab lunch. Sandwiches are huge, soups are good (particularly the potato and the ham/cheese), and they have several grab and go items as well.  Join their e-club for a coupon for a free ham sandwich- it's gigantic, probably what killed Mama Cass. You'll get another on your birthday. This particular location has a Yelp check-in offer for a free soda + chips, so grab a cup of soup and this can easily make two lunches for under $4. I feel like the turkey is even better than their namesake ham sando, but they're both large and fresh. The ham has a honey-mustard sauce that adds just the right amount of sweetness.  Service is polite, location is clean. I won't line up around the block to buy a full size ham here, but it's not bad for lunches. They also have pies and various condiments/seasonings for sale as well."}
{"text":"Love the food at HoneyBaked ham. Always delish! However, I ordered online for the first time and I can not begin to tell you how dissatisfied  I am.  First of all I ordered online for the convenience. Being that the ham was ordered a month ahead of when I wanted it you would think that there wouldn't be an issue. Nope...wrong. First trouble was the ham didn't show up on the day I had ordered it to be here. No email, phone call or any communication at all. I had to track the package ups. Ups tracking said the delivery was pushed back three days.... really? With perishable food?! Ok.... so the ham showed up three days later. The card board box on the outside looked fine.... but once opened the styrofoam contain was crushed, the ham was completely unthawed, no dry ice and the ham had leaked. The ham was wet but still just a little cool... not cold mind you... but cool. So, I called the 800 number to complain and was told that if the ham was still cool to the touch it was safe to eat and to have a happy thanks giving . No apology nothing...Sigh... ok well never again. I paid extra to have this ham delivered so I can worry if It will poison my family and friends. Thanks."}
{"text":"Such a yummy place! Went with the boyfriend today for lunch after he grabbed some gravy from here last night for dinner. So good! I love that they offer side options to purchase for meals, like pies, Mac n cheese, soup mixes, etc. I will definitely but purchasing one of their hams for thanksgiving and Christmas! New spot!"}
{"text":"I was nervous walking in to a line 30 deep that my procrastination was going to cost me an hour of my time. But I was in and out within 5 minutes!! Incredible organization."}
{"text":"There are about 10 associates and only three are on the register. C'mon guys, you should be better prepared than this. I get to the counter, at which we had a ham reserved, they informed me that they ran out however they are going to glaze a ham for me. WHAT IS THE POINT OF RESERVATION IF YOU ARE NOT PREPARED"}
{"text":"My employer gave us gift certificates here for Christmas, so my husband and I stopped by for lunch today to use that.  The service was friendly, but slow.  We just ordered two sandwiches which were tasty.  I got the classic turkey, and my husband got the classic ham. They were really sweet I think due to the \"honey\" glaze and sweet mustard.  Would I pay $9 for a combo here again? Probably not. But it was a nice, clean place to try for lunch.  I didn't like how their sides were all pre-packaged. I thought they'd make them fresh there, but I guess not."}
{"text":"If your religion prevents you from eating ham, then change religions immediately. This ham is worth it! I stopped in for a sandwich, and my god is it delicious. The club comes with ham turkey and bacon (crispy and cooked to perfection) and it was one of the best sandwiches I've had had in my life. This place is not for everyone. If you're some kind of fancy sandwich person that demands 9 meats and 25 condiments this is not the place for you. But if you like a wholesome, fresh, ham or turkey sandwich done to perfection, then look no further. Honey Baked, you have my salute."}
{"text":"Famous during the holidays but also a great spot for lunch. Their lunch combos are delish! Around $6 or so. The store is always clean. And the employees are always very helpful. The store is usually empty when I go, I don't think many people think to come here unless its thanksgiving or Christmas. Ask for their lunch card. After 5 sammies, the 6th one is free!!"}
{"text":"The turkey is good here and since I don't like ham. that is clearly an important element for me. With my coupon it was about 8 bucks for meal deal. The sandwich wasn't huge, but it was served on a fresh bakery roll with an average amount of sliced real turkey. Nothing fancy, except I added a slather of chipotle mayo and lettuce and tomato of course. Only a few choices of chips, but otherwise a good basic no frills sandwich with top quality meat inside. Place was empty at 1:30 PM."}
{"text":"What a nightmare.   Crowds backed up out the door because these people are not smart enough to hire the extra help for the holidays.  You wait over an hour to find they do not have what you need.   Next year it will be anything but honeybaked."}
{"text":"I ordered a ham and turkey breast for thanksgiving. I arrived the day before thanksgiving and there was a line out the door. The staff were working super hard and even though there were 70 people ahead of me, the line went fast and within 20 minutes I had paid and was out the door.   In the future, I am told the smart move is to pickup your ham and turkey on Tuesday before thanksgiving.  Either way, you will be purchasing very delicious ham and turkey- and your guests will lift you up on their shoulders and cheer for you after they eat their meal."}
{"text":"I expected a long line the Tuesday evening before Thanksgiving....they were well organized and I was in and out of there in less then 10 minutes.  The Ham is wonderful and the side dishes are always an easy and delicious addition to any meal.  Thumbs up!! Very Friendly Employees"}
{"text":"This was the first time I tried their sandwich.  I have to say it was pretty darn yummy, especially with the marbled rye bread."}
{"text":"I get nervous for this location every time I'm in there because it's usually very quiet . I don't understand why. This place is AMAZING for lunch. It's kept very clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is DELICIOUS!!!! I would hate to see this location close. So many of my favorite places have closed in this tough economy. If you're looking for a new place to have a delicious sandwich....YOU MUST try Honey Baked Ham Co. Worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the service April!  Everything was awesome. Picked up all my purchases, had lunch and back in the road in under 15-minutes!  The samples of the lemon cake was love at first bite"}
{"text":"My review is based on the sandwiches and not the frozen take home stuff. I love the sandwiches here. They are delicious and very affordable. The staff is always friendly and fast even when the store is very busy.   Wifey  and I will usually stop in on a weekend while we are doing shopping and errands. Most of the time we split a sandwich deal. The person making the sandwich always gives us our own tray with pickle and even our own soda even though we only bought one sandwich. I don't know if it's policy or just because I am so damn handsome!  The sandwiches are made with thick sliced ham and the veggies and bread are always fresh. I really like the classic ham but the bacon and ham is excellent as well. The only thing I am not a fan of is the potatoe salad.   The kicker of all these great sandwiches is that a sandwich, drink and chips is only $6- $8 bucks!! How can you breat that?  I do kinda miss the mustard bar at the honey baked in Oakland."}
{"text":"I've reviewed this on another post, but this one has a picture and probably getting more noticed. Seriously, this place has some of the best soup I've ever tasted. Today, I tried the white bean soup and it was perfectly wonderful! In addition, I had the classic turkey sandwich, which was on sourdough bread with swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato. Yummy! The turkey is real..meaning it isn't that watered down deli junk you see so many places.  In addition, they have a couple of freezers where you can buy ham bones (to make your own soups), soups, side dishes and turkeys and hams.  This place is REALLY good for soup/sandwiches and the people that work there are so friendly you'd think you were in the heartland!"}
{"text":"The quality of Honeybaked ham is, in my opinion, consistently outstanding. Their hams are all finished with a decadently sweet honey glaze and ready to eat, thanks to their patented spiral slicing technique.  They also offer smoked and honey-glazed turkey, along with a selection of prepared side dishes and desserts.  The one glaring caveat with this retailer is their price.  To be sure, people expect to pay more for a ready-to-eat product.  But the mark-up here is a bit excessive.  I paid $57.00 for an 8.5 lb ham, and that was with a $7.00 coupon.  Their variety of sandwiches and box lunches will elicit similar sticker shock, averaging $7.00 for meager offerings that would never be nicknamed \"Dagwood\"  If you are looking for a delicious, ready-to-eat ham, Honeybaked offers a convenient one-stop shop.  Just be prepared to shell out considerably."}
{"text":"Well, you had to expect this place to use real turkey and they did deliver on that respect. Very well formed sandwich on a bakery roll which was stacked with turkey, honey smoked bacon, onion, tomato and cheese. It would have been over nine bucks without the coupon, but the sides are not homemade, so just the sandwich and a bag of chips should be fine if you need a side. Turkey quality and Bread are usually the keys in all sandwiches and in those regards, this was an excellent sandwich. The prices for the whole sliced turkey and the three servings of sliced turkey are a bit lofty though, so the sandwich is the way to enjoy this place. Oh and yes they are very open to switching buns and condiments as well."}
{"text":"Yeah, they have hams and whatnot, but it's a good place for lunch too--their sandwiches rock."}
{"text":"HoneyBaked Ham has delicious ham. It is as good as I remembered years ago when I was in college and would bring home half a ham to Singapore for Christmas. We are lucky to have a cafe/store in Phoenix. I can drop in and grab a sandwich and be satiated with that delectable sweet and salty goodness. I got the croissant sandwich. The croissant was nice and flaky. I can't wait to grab another soon."}
{"text":"Now I don't know about the hams but sandwiches were atrocious and not the best service either. My ordering process went alright, the lady at the registered handled everything fine, but the sandwich making process was the issue. They were out of the appropriate cheeses for my sandwiches, and on the last sandwich the woman says, \"I didn't see that you didn't want tomato on two of these. Do you want me to unwrap them and take the tomato off?\". I really didn't know what to say to that. Why hadn't she read the order before thoroughly? All I could say was \"No I'll take the tomato off myself\". I was in a hurry to get back to work! Anyways, my roast beef sandwich (I don't eat ham or turkey and thats all they really offer) was the worst $7 sandwich I've probably ever had. Horribly spicy wasabi like mayo, one thin slice of roast beef, and dry croissant as the bread. I've had better sandwiches on an airplane. Not any place for lunch-the end."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  When I picked up ham it was coated with a thin coating. Got home the ham was not flavored with sweet honey baked sugar. Instead it was salty.  Extremly disapointed. Threw away $87"}
{"text":"Very disappointed, very little sweetness. Salty. Got my ham and Drove home to york SC expecting company. Ham wasnt coated with honey coating, very very disappointed.It  did have a thin light tan coating, very thin. Heated in oven as directed, salty!  BLEW  $78.  I would suggest  you go to Cosco and buy theirs."}
{"text":"Great people who was willing to give me great ideals with my holiday order for thanksgiving. I will be back for Christmas.   Great ideal for my ham bone."}
{"text":"Walk in to a super chill, simple café.  I got the classic ham sandwich with dinner roll bread (instead of croissant) and added bacon.....So delicious! I highly recommend this place for a simple, delicious,tasty,  lunch and peaceful atmosphere!"}
{"text":"The Skinny: awesome hams that requires no heating, sandwiches are great too (4) service: can be bogged down some times during the holiday season (4), value: it's definitely pricey but if it takes the cooking out of the holidays, I am all for it. (4).  There is something very festive about Honey Baked Ham. I mean I don't really think about it all until the holidays. But when you remember, it is like a stroke of genius.  Literally to serve the ham, you take it out of the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Done. No heating (unless you really want to). No fuss. That is it. Rather than stressing, you can actually enjoy the holidays. As a mom of a very active toddler, this place is a godsend.   I took brought down to the office for a potluck too. It was awesome because there is no way we can heat much up at the office.  The hams taste great...the crusty topping is like a sweet and salty crack. Amazingballs.  The cost is not prohibitive but it isn't cheap either. A 10 lb half bone in ham cost around $70. ($7ish/lb) That being said, the sheer lack of effort to have an enjoyable family meal is priceless.  Just a note - ordering ahead of time on the phone is pointless too because they still have to look for a ham for you. Next time, I am going to order online as they have a separate line for only that. I probably would have saved some time that way.  We got some free sandwiches too by joining their club....they are delish! The tavern club is great and they don't skimp on meat.  I love Honey Baked Ham because cooking during the holidays is for the birds. Come on by and take the stress out of the holiday season!"}
{"text":"Classic ham sandwich is excellent!   Margaret was very accommodating on our special requests and the sandwiches were made with perfection"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised with the little cafe inside of HoneyBaked Ham.  The sandwiches were delicious, decent sized and reasonably priced.  The cafe is small but comfortable and  nicely decorated. The girl who waited on us was efficient and very pleasant. This will be our new go to place for lunch."}
{"text":"I've been contemplating writing this review because selfishly I really don't want this store to become too popular.  Reason is it's great place to go for lunch because it's relaxing to not have very many other guests.    I always love getting a Honeybaked Ham for the holidays and was very excited to learn that I could have it year round.  Their menu is deli style and has more of a selection than just ham.  On my last visit, I had the Bistro Turkey and Brie.  The was fresh, the brie added creaminess and the sourdough bread topped it off (my favorite type of bread).  Definitely recommend the potato salad as your side.  Hopefully this doesn't ruin my secret lunch spot! ha"}
{"text":"Love, love, love their hams. I've tried others and nothing is quite like a HoneyBaked ham. I don't need a holiday to come to want one. The service is nice the samples are good. Recommend it highly, just be prepared during holiday time, there is always a line and it is crowded."}
{"text":"We ordered for both Thanksgiving and Christmas and I will say we really enjoyed the ham and the turkey we bought. Best of all the staff was kind and helpful. The line was fast and organized just perfectly. Great job to all of you."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this review. The products I received, being 2 turkey breasts, were good. It's a Honeybaked ham product though so it's exactly what you expect. My issue comes in due to customer service. I'm giving 3 stars and cutting them some slack, however I can't imagine ever going back. I walked in first thing at 9am. I was picking up turkey for a work pot luck. A woman had arrived ahead of me who apparently had her entire office catered by them. I went to the pick up side of the counter and it was a bit crazy over there due to her large order, but I waited patiently. A woman came out gave me a exasperated why are you here look and asked me what I wanted. I explained I had pre-ordered and was there to pick up (hence the side of the counter I was at). She barked at me, well what did you order. I told her and she acted like they never received such and order and asked if I had a confirmation number. I went and got it and came back in. She had disappeared and another person came out. She was nicer but I had to repeat the process. Turns out it didn't matter they had plenty of turkeys in stock, as indicated by another woman who came out. I think the third woman may have been a manager or supervisor... she was very nice.  Long story short, the turkey was good but that first woman who \"helped\" me kind of left me feeling blah about the place. I imagine she was having a bad/overwhelming start to the day so I give 3 stars in an effort to give the benefit of the doubt and because the food was as ordered."}
{"text":"Tosha at this location ROCKS! I've received awesome customer service. Tosha went above and beyond to make my order perfect. I would totally recommend this Honey Baked Ham location for your next event! Eddie S"}
{"text":"I expect the same call on the 23rd of December every year, and this is how it goes:  *ring ring* Me: Hello Frantic, frazzled, harried mom: Hi honey, how are you? Me: Oh, hi Mom.  I'm good, how's it going? FFHM: Oh, good, except...Oh, I forgot the ham. Me: Of course you did. FFHM: Could you go down to the Honey Baked Ham Store and get me their biggest* ham? Me: *sighing* Sure, Mom. FFHM: Ok, just remember, I want their BIGGEST* ham!  Thank you!  I love you! Me: You're welcome!  I love you too!  *Note that the greatest number of adults we've had at Christmas dinner in the past few years has been something like, oh, 7.  And there's a turkey.  And all the sides.  And a few pies.  And a roast leg of beast, or somejunk.  We really, REALLY don't need the BIGGEST ham.  Anyway, I pack myself up and get myself to the Honey Baked Ham Store.    And I get in line.    Oh yeah, I'm totally standing outside.  Because it's December 23, and everyone and their mom (except mine!) is picking up their ham.  But look, the line, it MOVES.  It moves QUICKLY.  It moves so fast it's line Disneyland on crack.  I finally get in and my eyes can hardly believe what they are seeing.  The hams are flying so fast they're almost being launched from the arms of the employees into the still-chapped hands of the ham-needers.  I get to the counter with the speed of a cheetah on Dexatrim, and I blurt out, \"Ineedyourbiggestham,please!\" but my request goes unheeded.  Only hearing \"ham\" the, by now, automaton of an employee just hands me a ham as one behind me asks if I'd like chutney - which I get every year and which no one eats.  And hey, that ham is tasty.  That is the best ham out there, and I don't like ham.  Their turkey is some kind of glazed gift from a benevolent God it was easier to pretend didn't exist anymore.  The wait in the line is worth it, although their efficiency invariably leads to lack of hearing.  It's a holiday plight no one's thought of.  (Kudos to my mom for doubtlessly laughing at this although I tease her.  She knows she the best.)"}
{"text":"Amazing ham. Friendly staff. I enjoy picking up to go. Never disappointed with my choice to come here."}
{"text":"Simply the best! Everyone that works there is so friendly and knowledgeable. It's our favorite place to buy ham and turkey!!"}
{"text":"The reason for my low rating for this location of HoneyBaked Ham is their customer service, or lack thereof.   For a family gathering in Las Vegas, I pre-ordered a Ham online. On the drive to Las Vegas, I was making pretty good time so I called and asked if I could pick up my order earlier than I had initially requested. Who ever answered the phone wasn't able to answer my questions and I ended up holding for a few minutes until someone came on the line, who was able to. It didn't get any better - the person who came on the line was dismissive as she couldn't find my order even after giving her all the pertinent information. She ended up just telling me to come on in.   Arriving at the store, I encounter a short line, which I didn't think much of - because how long could the wait be to place an order and pay for it. The wait ended up being about thirty minutes because four employees were helping one person. That person was either an employee or a regular because all of their attention was on this one person. She wasn't being difficult - she was just very comfortable speaking with and joking with the staff, annoying the rest of us in line because it's not we didn't have things to do, or places to go. When I finally get up to the counter, it didn't get any better because the person didn't know how to handle an online order leaving me to wait for another person who knew how to.   The person who finally helped me wasn't able to find my online order either - but because there were a lot of Hams available, grabbed me one close to the size that I had ordered. Almost 40 minutes to pick up a ham, that was pre-ordered online is pretty bad customer service. It would be one thing if it were really busy, however, it wasn't. And employees who have no idea how to handle online orders is pretty bad in this day and age.   As for the ham, it was great. Family loved it."}
{"text":"Ham samich.  They don't get much better than this.  I highly recommend trying one if you haven't.  I quite enjoyed my Tavern sandwich.  Ham, bacon, cheese, tomato, lettuce, and a delicious honey mustard sauce were perfectly crafted between two slices of whole wheat bread.  I'd have to say this is one of the best deli style places I've been too, but keep in mind that I am not really a deli sandwich connoisseur.  I got the ham salad as a side, and I would have to say it was the right choice.  It was down right delicious.  Just do yourself a favor, and get this stuff with your sandwich.  Better yet, they have a ham salad sandwich (that I can't wait to try).  The service was friendly too.  The manager gave us four catering packages to give out to our business associates.  I am really hoping that my work orders some catering service from Honeybaked Ham.  They just kill that other deli that we have been ordering from for our staff meetings!"}
{"text":"They prepped for the holiday, that's for sure. I have never seen this many people work here at one time. Got my ham, a pecan pie, and a sandwich for $39.00. Ten minutes total time from parking the car, to walking out with bags in hand. This is how a busy womyn does the holidays!"}
{"text":"I love this place.   Great place to have a nice lunch.  They have great ham.  Best ever.   They are open for lunch everyday.  The staff is great and friendly.  I love how clean the place was. If you have not tried the ham here, you are missing out on great and delicious and very flavorful.  The manager did a great job and helped out when it got busy and the staff took care of everyone with a smile.   I have not been to any of the other stores in town that they have but I love this one and I drive out of my way to come eat here from time to time. I ordered catering one time for my company event and everyone loved it and it was as great as going  and eating there.  The girl that delivered everything was nice and friendly and set everything up and we enjoyed every bit.   I have been coming here for years and will continue to be a regular customer.  I love this place and hope the food will continue to be so great.  Keep up the great food."}
{"text":"I altered my way home, adding 30 minutes to my commute, in order to pick up items for a business luncheon we are hosting. They closed 20 minutes early.   The door was dead bolted even though I could see the employees inside. If you plan to use them, call to verify the hours they actually plan on being open ahead of time!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches and value. I always come here for the holidays but while out looking for some place quick and not fried I recalled HBH has sandwiches.  We came in and were surprised that there was bean soup, potato salad and a long list of sandwiches. We got the combos which included sandwich, side, drink and a cookie. Great deal when feeding hungry boys."}
{"text":"Never ate here before but have seen it many times. Today I was craving a sandwich so I stopped in. I want to start off by saying that everyone working was very polite and a pleasure to deal with. I decided on a BLT as I wanted something I usually don't eat. It was very good. Had a lot of bacon on it and the bread was very fresh. I got the combo as a sandwich just never fills me up enough so I chose a side of the macaroni salad which was excellent. Was worth the $8.00 I spent and would for sure come back. Maybe next time I will try the ham!!"}
{"text":"Victoria is awesome great customer service Margaret is very sweet as well . Overall great place to grab a bite (:"}
{"text":"Sandwiches were so good. Fresh and very reasonable. The ladies working here are so nice, they even packed and labeled our leftovers to go for us."}
{"text":"Honeybaked Ham has always been a holiday regular on the table while I was growing up. Part of what I like about them is sentimental, the other part is that I genuinely like what they have to offer. Along with their signature baked ham, they offer sandwiches and salads which are equally good. I like that they're open relatively early, about 9am on most days. However, sometimes, they can be a bit inconvenient. For example, on holiday weekends, the entire menu is on hold so they can focus selling their hams and/or turkeys. I am not a person who has much time on their hands and to drive to the store is a bit out of my way. So imagine how frustrated I can get when I am there for something specific and I can't get it. Also, I regularly get the turkey salad container to go. On more then one occasion, they have been low on  ingredients to make the day's turkey salad. I have learned to call ahead and make sure they are able to give me what I want before I drive all the way over there. If I call ahead, they can even set it aside as I make my way there."}
{"text":"Everytime I eat here the food is of the best quality. My only complaint would be there is not a location closer to me. Totally worth the thirty minute drive though!"}
{"text":"Today I came in for a ham. So I ask the clerk at the counter for a boneless ham he brings me one with a bone. I point out it has a bone the clerk says oh and wraps in back up and brings me a boneless ham like I asked. So then I asked if they can slice the ham for me,  the clerk says we sell it by the slice, so again I ask can you slice this ham, and again I get the same answer.  So I just said thanks bought my ham and went home.  I come to find out, the ham was already sliced I just couldn't tell because of the sugar or honey or whatever you call it glazed on the ham. I gave 4 stars because the hams are so good and the clerk was new."}
{"text":"Recently my daughter and I bought two nearly tasteless and dry McDonald's meals for approx. $15.  Yesterday, for the same amount of money, we had a Classic Ham sandwich and a Tavern Club from HoneyBaked.  There was absolutely no comparison (except for McD's overpriced offering).  Our HoneyBaked experience was wonderful.  Delightful assistance from store associate, delicious food and a feeling of money very well spent.  Will we return?  Oh, yeah!"}
{"text":"So the only Honeybaked Ham location I know of is in Colma, CA. I think my cousin had a short stint of working there and hated it and I've never heard anyone else talk about it otherwise. When I was visiting my company's home office in North Carolina, Honeybaked catered and I was pleasantly surprised. Visited the actual location and grabbed a sandwich - was made very fresh, workers were cordial and it was free cookie Friday. $7 is a bit pricey for just a sandwich, but the meat is high quality and delicious!"}
{"text":"We ordered our Thanksgiving dinner & it was divine. So easy, delicious & convenient! We called the store & did not have to leave our name or a card number to hold anything, nor pay in advance. They just ask you what you want, what day you are picking up & give you a confirmation number. I recommend going early if your pick up day is the day before T-GIving. Not that they aren't fast & efficient there. The staff was courteous & they even show you your ham before you take it out of the store. The sweet potato casserole was so good, I wanted to get a spoon & hoard it in the corner. The green bean casserole was flavorful, but I think I will get another side next time. We also got the turkey breast which was great for turkey sandwiches the next day. The turkey kind of tasted like the ham with the same glaze so if you're looking for something different, keep that in mind. The pecan pie was very tasty as well. I guarantee you wont be disappointed with the price either, well worth the money & not at all expensive."}
{"text":"Honey baked ham never disappoints!! We order it every Thanksgiving and Easter. Same delicious ham and I love the brown sugar crust!! Left over ham on point and have to say the people that work their are always super nice."}
{"text":"You have made a fan for life!  I came in on 4/2/18, the location is close to my work and I thought why not?  I am not a fan of fast food and did not have a ton of time.  I ordered the half sandwich and half salad option and it was so good.  The food was made to order and fresh, it tasted wonderful, and the staff was helpful and fast.  I will be adding this location to my lunch rotation and wanted to say thank you for giving people a great alternative to fast food."}
{"text":"Love Honeybaked Hams... and their Turkey is excellent too!   You can even get sides for a complete and delicious meal! OR... you can go for lunch and order a tasty sandwich and side.  Suggestion... call ahead and order the size ham you want.... especially if you are ordering during holiday times."}
{"text":"I was always a little weary to try this place but I'm glad I did I've been here twice and the sandwiches are so amazing. The people working are so friendly and nice. It's really slow I've never seen anyone actually eating in there. definitely an awkward kind of setting. But overall the prices are fair and the food is delicious and fresh.  Just a heads up the yelp coupon doesn't work here for some reason but they were able to give me a different coupon they had."}
{"text":"Though the food is usually tasty at HoneyBaked Ham the service at this location is awful!   I came in and ordered a couple of sandwiches to go and sides of potato salad and ham salad. The food was pretty good, for sandwiches. I enjoyed it.  They just seemed very unorganized about getting orders taken and prepared. The cash register apparently couldn't ring up half of the sandwiches on the menu, and the person making sandwiches kept asking people what they had ordered and acting like it was a pain in the rear to make it.  The place is cold and outdated in side, not a very welcoming place to sit and have lunch. Several people came in and out with to-go orders but only one other person was dining in. I'll stick to carry out if I ever come back!"}
{"text":"Everyone knows to expect long waits at honeybaked but they do it for the quality. This location failed! Not a happy camper."}
{"text":"OMG....We served this to 20 family members for Christmas dinner and I could not have been happier!  Honestly, I could easily have done without the extra smoked turkey I ordered...everybody went for the delicious ham.  Don't bother with the smoked ham, it doesn't hold a candle to the original.  Yes, be prepared for a long line.  I'm sure they could organize it in a better way, but was absolutely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This review is solely based on their sandwiches cause we love their ham and get one every year for the holidays! Maybe we went in with too high of expectations but we were super disappointed with the food.  Without question, their meat is some of the best. We had two sandwiches, the Roasted Turkey w/ Apple Butter and the Tavern Club. Both meats alone were spectacular as expected but the sandwiches altogether were just ok. They are skimpy with the toppings, they microwave their bacon and the pretzel bread...tasted nothing like pretzel. It pretty much had no flavor at all. Their hickory honey mustard is super sticky and other than a slight honey flavor, it's dull. I did like the apple butter but they doused the sandwich with it and it overpowered the turkey.   For the prices of $6.49 and $6.99, I thought they were super skimpy with the toppings. Then to make it a combo with a small side or chips then a CAN of soda, it'll cost you another $2.49. We both left still hungry and pretty bummed out about the whole experience."}
{"text":"Honeybaked ham is delicious!  The meat is very tender. The honey gives a sweet flavoring.  The store is clean and the service is friendly.  The price might seem high but it is worth every penny."}
{"text":"I called ahead to order three Lunches for pickup. The location is easy to find, clean and orderly.   and the Staff is Exceptional--Thank You, Felicia and Tasha!!  I thought my order was demanding, but it was prepared flawlessly--specifically the 1/2Sandwich1/2Salad (MedVeggie, no cheese \"allergy\").  My salad came w/o cheese also, though I hadn't ordered it that way...Awesome.  and Yummy--See y'all Soon!"}
{"text":"They are one of my 2 \"go-to\" places for company.  They have a quality product, great flavors, good service, and if any of you haven't ordered their Artisan Sandwich trays, what are you waiting for?!!  I just wish my real local store (Lyndhurst) was open year-round.  I used to pick up dinner items after work, too. Now I order from Willoughby."}
{"text":"The 2 ladies working here were very nice. The soup I ordered was very good. I ordered a sandwich to go and was surprised to see it was wrapped in plastic wrap.  Sandwiches wrapped in plastic makes rolls rubbery as well as making the sandwich soggy when the sandwich has mayo, mustard, tomatoes etc. anything with liquid (if not eaten right away). I hope they change this to a paper wrap because the ham was good but by the time I got to eat my sandwich it was rubbery and soggy."}
{"text":"Unbelievably bad service.  I had called and ordered a roast turkey breast to be picked up on 12/22.  I was given a number (6).  I was in line outside t he store for 1 1/2  hours and then another 1/2 hour in the store.  No one asked for the number.  Several people in line around us were surprised that those of us who had a number weren't asked for it.  We ordered it ahead of time and we all assumed we'd be in and out quickly.  Two hours on a cold day in December is not quick.  The store was crowded (probably the fire department would not have been happy with the number of people in the store).  I don't know if the other stores are like this but I can guarantee you that I will never come to this store again - ever!"}
{"text":"Was given very old lettuce used in their salad. Honestly lost my appetite and didn't bother with the soup. Whoever is in charge of inventory needs to check their supplies. Whoever made this obviously doesn't care about customers. The person who brought it didn't even look. It's so old it's beyond wilted. It's started to brown and basically spoil."}
{"text":"I needed somewhere new to try for lunch so after reading the reviews i decided to give this place a try. The place was clean and quiet. The workers were in the back slicing up ham and turkey i guess. I had to shout to the back for someone to come up to help me. The store offered an online coupon for free chips and a drink for checking in on yelp, even though the coupon was outdated the lady was kind enough to yet honor it. My sandwich and potato salad was good but a bit pricey."}
{"text":"3 words for you...Chipotle Chicken Sandwich....run....don't walk to any Honeybaked Ham shop and grab one. I sometimes have 3 in one week and they are 3.97 with a coupon for a limited time. I have to say though I would pay the regular price for them....because they are that good and the service is that good as well. Eat, Drink. and be Merry my Friends!!!!"}
{"text":"The best spiral cut honeybaked ham ever made .   A definite must do :-)"}
{"text":"Best sandwich's around. Honestly can't believe anyone goes to Subway next door.  Employees are always friendly and helpful!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches for lunch, offering artisan breads and fresh garnishes. Hearty soups and salads are also available; check out their Lenten specials this time of year."}
{"text":"This place is awful. Very bad customer service as well as the employees don't seem to know what they have and don't have. They've messed up my order multiple times and the employees seem oblivious to what's going on."}
{"text":"First Time here and don't bother ordering online for holiday pickup. They still sort you in the same line as everyone else. So plan on waiting a good while if you're trying to plan for your holiday meal.  Perhaps one year the manager will think about making a better plan."}
{"text":"Slowest sandwich shop EVER!! You have a total of 3 people working during the lunch rush. None of which can answer the phone and take an order because of the lack of employees available. Just doesn't seem like a very efficient lunch spot."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  I love to cook and bake but I will honestly admit that when Thanksgiving and Easter come around I have to serve a HBH on my table. It is just too yummy and gives me the time to make all the sides.  I stopped in for lunch and was surprised at the options they have now for lunch. Sine this one is in the same Walmart parking lot I do my grocery shopping it is a convenient stop for a yummy lunch sandwich.  I ordered a \"Tavern Club\". It had Honey baked Ham and Honey Baked Turkey! It also had onion, tomato, honey mustard, mayo, bacon, cheese and was served on multi-grain bread. It cost $5.99. I decided to make it a combo which added another $1.99 and got a can of Coke and a bag of chips.  It tasted SO good!  The staff was very friendly and made my sandwich fresh right in front of me.   The cashier gave me a coupon for my next visit and a punch card.  For every 5th sandwich you buy you get 1 free. Just ask them for one! They punched the coupon she gave me and said they will transfer it each time I come in.  If you haven't stopped by for lunch and are thinking they just offer whole or mini hams then you have to give a sandwich a try!"}
{"text":"I'm a new fan!  I haven't been here in years!  My co-workers use to go here all the time and get a platter of sandwiches!  They were dry, no pop to them.  Just lettuce, tomatoes, mayo and mustard packets!  So I didn't care for them. My son got a gift certificate from his job and gave it to me.  So We go and wait in the line.  (X-mas eve)  Let me tell ya'll  When I took that first bite!  WOW!  That was amazing, it was sweet and crunchy on the edges!  I'm a fan!  I will be getting a honey baked ham every holiday from here on out!"}
{"text":"Not just for delicious holiday hams! I stopped here for lunch and enjoyed a quickly made fresh roasted turkey sandwich.   There are several meats to choose from besides ham so I ordered turkey. The sandwich came with fresh veggies, a honey mustard sauce, your choice of cheese and a healthy portion of sweet smokey meat on a onion bun. The prices are of good value and you get several side options including salad, chips or pasta.   The restaurant didn't have too many people in it so we were able to grab some seats and the place was very clean.   It's a nice little place to pick up a sandwich and they also have items in stock all year long including delicious orange rolls. I bought some of those to take home as well."}
{"text":"Best Ham and Cheese sandwich at any price anywhere.   HoneyBaked ham and cheese!  ...and the fact that it is $6.50 is amazing!  In addition, the turkey and others are all worth ordering.  Best condiments.  Really add interest to the sandwiches.   Folks think of this place at the holidays, and of course they should. But, you don't need a holiday to enjoy a great sandwich.   Eat one there or take home a pound of meat and make one later. I think the sliced meats go for around $10 a pound...about what you would pay at any grocery store deli. The meat here is way better!  My only slight quibble is that they don't carry their bundt cakes year around. They should.  You can spend $10 or more on a sandwich most places, even $13 at some.  None as good as these."}
{"text":"Special thanks to this HoneyBaked Ham Store! We use this store for lunches regularly and they always are on time, the order is correct and delivery on time! We have a busy season each year that we double up their orders and they always handle this with pride! Even when I text over changes after hours! BRAVO to the HoneyBaked Team, Tasha and Margaret! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I first tried Honeybaked at a friends house and was impressed with the taste. This year I didn't want to make a ham or a turkey so I did the next best thing, I order them. A 4 pound bone in ham and a turkey Brest roasted to perfection. Both come with that nice glaze and very flavorful.  As expected the line to the store was out the door. I pre ordered mine by phone but if you order online you bypass the bigger line. The wait in line was only about 20 mins and the girl who helped my was very pleasant. You can tell she had a long crazy day but kept a smile and positive attitude the entire time.   The price is a bit high but I feel it is worth it for the quality of food they give you. They also have side dishes you can buy and the serve sandwhiches on a regular basis. I will use them again and recommend them to friends."}
{"text":"Sometimes you visit a place just knowing you will regret your decision.  At least 10 years ago and probably closer to 15 I picked up ham sandwiches to go here.  I did not care for either the sandwiches or the value and just never went back.  This was at a time when Honey Baked Ham company was first trying to find something to sell the 8 months of the year folks were not buying what many, including me, view as over priced meats for holidays.  Fast forward to today and I decided to take advantage of a coupon I found on line for a complete lunch for $6 (normally $8-9).  First impression on entering the deli/store that was remodeled about 5 years ago was very good.  The place is inviting and spotless, with racks and coolers with stuff for sale and an eating area off to one side.  The eating areas has about a dozen 2 tops that can be chained to fit larger parties.  The sandwich I chose was delicious.  They have about 20 to chose from and they can be modified to some extent.  I opted for the additional cost garden salad which the corporate programmed cash registers would not allow for the special pricing but they made it work.  The salad ($2.27) is actually a field greens mix and the croutons and dressing were served on the side (bonus points).  If you are eating in the lunch is served on real plates with real silverware, I thought this was amazing for a place that sells so much stuff to go in plastic containers.  Service is order at the counter and they bring it to you.  Serve yourself drinks.  Two different people came by while I was eating to make sure I was not in need of anything.  After my meal I explored the racks of stuff for sale and found packages of bean soups to make, various mustard/mayo/dressing containers and other stuff including preserves that were made without HFCS.  I purchased some delicious peach preserves that at $4,69 were in the right price range for what they were.  During the off season you can get coupons for stuff on line and I intend to take advantage of them.  This is now an addition to my lunch rotation as even at normal prices I consider them a good value."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are excellent and well worth the price. I always get my sandwich on marble rye bread. Delicious."}
{"text":"We always receive good service and great food when coming to Honeybaked for lunch.  They have a variety of sandwich, soup, salad, and side choices.  And there are always coupons available online for discounts on lunch items and to go items like their signature hams and turkey breasts.  Today we stopped in for lunch and to pick up a ham for my Superbowl gathering.  All bone in hams were on sale for $39.99, so I got $15 off a $65 dollar ham.  Pretty sweet.  For lunch I ordered the Tavern Club sandwich combo on marble rye.  This is what you order when you can't decide what to get because it has ham, turkey breast, bacon, cheddar, lettuce, & tomato.  Meatacopia!  It was delicious and the bread was super soft, but I could not even finish 1/2 of my sandwich because it was so filling.  Totally loaded with protein.  My friend ordered it in a lettuce wrap, which was a smarter way to go."}
{"text":"Contrary to the name of this establishment, this place also sells turkey as well (for my Jewish friends). I honestly think they have one of the best sandwiches around. They offer a lot of different sandwiches on the menu and for lunch, you can make it a half sandwich + side (soup, chips, or potato salad, etc) + drink combo for less than 8-9 dollars. I usually get the Southwestern turkey melt which is stuffed with turkey, pepperoncini, lettuce, tomato, and red onions.   They also have a fair amount of coupon deals going on where you can get a lunch combo for less than 6 dollars. Another plus is that they offer free samples and you can order feasts for holidays."}
{"text":"lunch from honeybaked ham is a fun little treat for me. i normally completely forget this place exists so when i remember i head over immediately. my favorite (and today's lunch) is the tuscan turkey pesto. the pesto is flavorful, the turkey is always moist and tasty and the kicker is the vinaigrette that goes on top of the spring mix lettuce on the sandwich. pesto + vinaigrette = heaven! minus one star because honeybaked ham lunch is a bit pricey at $6.82 (including tax) for just the sandwich. but speaking of cost, i just noticed my receipt has a coupon for $1 off my next sandwich ... yay! i just hope i remember to use it."}
{"text":"I had never been to honeybaked ham before, but had to feed 90 people for a Thanksgiving meal the day before Thanksgiving. We placed our order online a week and a half prior to the date. Ordering eight packages of roasted sliced turkey breast seem to be the best option. I got a confirmation email with an order number telling me where the location was, and when I could pick it up.  I found the location easily, and prepared myself for a massive line as I had been warned by others. The line wasn't bad at all it was inside there was maybe 15 people ahead of me and it was nearly 8 AM. Everyone in the line seemed jovial, and the staff was really doing everything they could to make everyone happy and get them out quickly.  When I approached the counter I gave them my order number and they had no idea what I had ordered. I pulled up a confirmation email and it did not say much except for the location and my order number. That shouldn't of been a problem if I had been the one to place the order, but I had no idea what I was picking up at the time. They didn't have a system where the orders were laid out, they had a list of the orders, or that they could look up to expedite my experience. It turned out that they needed to present me with all of my different options while I scrambled and try to get a hold of the person who had placed the order.   Thank goodness the person placing the order got back to me while I was still at the location. Tayler and his team were very nice and really tried to help, but it seems that the business itself set them up for failure by allowing people to order online ahead of time but not telling the team what should be ready for being picked up.   The food was fantastic and the price was OK. Tayler help me carry my bags out of the car and wished me a happy holiday. He made a situation that could've been pretty bad pretty awesome. I'll definitely be back, but I'll call in the order myself."}
{"text":"Love this place. Just the smell when you walk in makes you want to buy everything. The service here is so great an they are always accommodating letting you choose the ham that looks best an the size you want. I always end up getting a bigger ham then we need but what the heck right. They are so good an yummy an you can always freeze what you don't eat. I also love the sides they have. The apples an the orange cranberry are to die for. I never leave without grabbing one. The pies are equally as yummy. I also like the spreads they have for the sandwich's. I like this location as it's close to my house an i always get great service."}
{"text":"I should really make an attempt to visit this HoneyBaked Ham store at a time other than around the holidays. I see that they serve sandwiches and sell their wares like a normal store/cafe, year-round.  I visited several days before Christmas.  I was able to go online and reserve a ham in my choice of size. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know that I have a weak spot for places with online ordering.  The interior is well set up and clean. The inventory, even for the holiday, was stocked. There was a lady set up in the corner, giving out samples of some salad and holiday concoctions. Frankly, it was nice to have a little snack while waiting in line. Their marketing ploy worked like a charm, and I ended up with my arms full of several holiday side dishes and bread. Bonus for not having to create (ahem,  Pinterest) my own recipes for side dishes. The staff at the counter was very kind and thorough, despite the really busy atmosphere. My ham was displayed for me to approve prior to acceptance. The instructions for cooking were printed on my plastic shopping bag. This is genius! I will definitely be back to this location to just try a sandwich, or get some more sides. My family really enjoyed them, and I'm interested to see what they offer year-round."}
{"text":"I placed my order online and showed up at my designated time on Christmas Eve only to find one long line that weaved through the business and out the door. There was no separate line for those who already ordered. Once in line, I had to wait there for 45 minutes behind a person with serious intestinal issues. Once I got to the front of the line, I asked if he wanted my order number and he said it wasn't necessary.... Then why did I bother placing an order at all???? As I told him my list of items, I asked for the $6.99 mini cheesecake from my online order and he said they didn't have that. I inquired about what they had comparable and was told a full-size cheesecake sampler for $14.99. I started to complain and he called over another employee who proceeded to tell me the website is not indicative of their selection. WHAT???? I was at a complete loss.  Fortunately, the food was amazing and the package deals made the cost very reasonable. I will probably go back, but begrudgingly."}
{"text":"Is it a restaurant is it a Deli? Not sure one thing I am sure of the ham is winner winner pork's for dinner.   I like to go and get slices for sammies during the week. The croissants there are really tasty. Put the ham on the croissant omg there's a party in your mouth. Delish  If you have never had Honey Baked Ham you aint had ham dang this is good stuff!"}
{"text":"My family just relocated to the Phoenix area from Seattle and have been eating Honey baked ham for years. In fact their sandwiches were our favorite and my 6 year old loved the soup(anyone with children probably knows how difficult it is to get them to eat sometimes). In any case after being in the area for a few weeks we were excited to see something familiar when we ran into the honey baked ham in Paradise Valley.   We walked in and there was only one gentleman sitting in the cafe we were told they would be with us shortly. After waiting for about 5 min. With no sign of any employees my husband noticed the gentlemen sitting there had some really incredible tattoos and walked over to compliment the mans art. The work was done by a very famous artist and the guy lit up and started telling us stories and showing off his work (still none else in sight including employees). We probably talked for an additional 10 min. Waiting for service when a male employee came shooting out of the back and got right in my husbands face, asking very rudely, \" Can I help you!\" My husband said, \"yes we're here for sandwich's.\" The employee at this point took a very aggressive stance and told us that he would have to ask us to leave as we were \"soliciting\" his clientele. The gentlemen we were speaking with got up at this point and said he was leaving as well. It was very apparent that all parties in the dining area were having a welcomed conversation about a common interest. I have never in my life been treated so rudely, or had an employee be so aggressive towards me or my family. My son began crying as we tried to gather our  things. As we tried to leave this horrible person continued to yell at us from behind the counter. I don't know what else to say in my experience you just simply don't treat people this way let alone a customer. I WILL NEVER be visiting this establishment again and would encourage others to save them selves the humiliation of being treated like a second class citizen and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"We all love honey baked ham company ham. I heard they served lunch and wanted to try it out. I ordered the BBQ stacker. The BBQ stacker has ham,lettuce,cheese,red onion served on ciabatta  bread. The sandwich was excellent as expected and very fresh. The service was good and the wait time was to be expected under 10 minutes. I will definitely add this to my favorite lunch spots!"}
{"text":"The way the new manger run the Holidays is AMAZING!!! You are in and out in less than 15 mins, when you order your ham or turkey prior. The gals are always so sweet and nice. They are wonderful . Keep up the GREAT WORK!!!"}
{"text":"Holiday ham is always great from here. For years we have gotten a honey baked, no matter where our travel takes us during the holidays, and it's become a part of our tradition."}
{"text":"Came in with standard expectations but wowed by very friendly and courteous service.  Server went above call and made sure visit was exceptional pleasant.  Food was delicious. Def a place to visit beyond christmas or easter ham."}
{"text":"Excellent ham! There are several cuts: regular, mini, and miscut (slight discount). It's no surprise when the line is pretty much out the door during the holidays, not to mention wrapped around inside too. As was the case a few years ago, when I went with my mom. For years, many families here have enjoyed the delicious ham and turkey during Easter, Thanksgiving, & Christmas. Save the bone for Ham Bone Soup- it's so yummy. You can also buy the bone, but there is a limit of one to a customer. Many years ago, there was a location on Maryland Parkway, across from the Boulevard Mall, but that's showing how long I've called Las Vegas home.  Not only does this company have excellent ham, the turkey is excellent too (roasted, smoked). There are free samples of the turkey (both kinds) and other products. Sometimes the turkey is on special for $19.99 during the holidays. There are several other excellent products like the ham bone soup mix, mustard, pineapple chutney, and side dishes too.   This company also makes yummy sandwiches. I got the Classic-  roasted turkey, lettuce, tomato, savory sauce, mustard, on a soft sweet kaiser looking roll that smashes down as you eat it.  My husband likes the Smoke Stacker- ham, lettuce, minus the tomatoes which I end up getting, barbeque sauce, on a ciabatta roll (not overly big, which I hate getting). If you get the stamp card, you will get a free sandwich after purchasing 5 sandwiches. We got the combos (lots of choices- salads, chips, etc., and both cost a little over $16.00. FYI, if you have a gift card, don't separate the card from the card that it is attached to, or else, the gift card is no good- it states so on the card.   Located in a strip mall on Rainbow, not far from Charleston. Small but clean store, with less than ten tables with chairs. Bathrooms are located in the small hallway to the left. In front of the bathrooms stands an automatic hand sanitizer station- neat. There are two counters (cashier, ham). One refrigerated section to the right as you enter the store. Small but clean location. The people working there were really nice. She messed up my order but gave us a free brownie for the mixup. There were no other customers before but after us, there were a couple customers; not sure if this is typical for sunday morning.  The other locations are at Centennial/Ann area & Henderson- Sunset, near Chuck E Cheese."}
{"text":"Great location being that they are close to my job and great customer service. Everytime I come in the store, I have alwasys been greeted with a hello and smile! Ask about the Sandwhich Club punch card, buy 10 sandwiches and get the 11th for free. I always get the Ham Classic... Yum!  I've ordered for meetings as well and they always get the order right and I've never heard any compaints! I would recommend this location and plan on eating here at least once a week."}
{"text":"I can't believe Dave S. and I went to the same location! I received really great customer service.   I had never been there before and the man at the counter was just over the top nice. I got a chicken salad sandwich that was delicious (although I will get it on wheat bread next time and not the croissant, it was really just croissant-shaped white bread) and that day they were giving out free iced teas.   They also have a punch card, if you buy 5 sandwiches you get a free one (and you get two punches on Tuesdays). Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We just picked up our Easter ham and the girls working there were so friendly and helpful! They were organized and very efficient! We realized that we might not have ordered a big enough ham when we did it online and they had plenty of extras to \"save\" us! Very great customer service!"}
{"text":"Awesome Ham and Excellent service !! Thank you Kelvin for being patient and helpful with my daughter and I while we figured out our order for Easter dinner ! decisions, decisions LOL hope you have a Blessed Easter."}
{"text":"Didn't know they carried meals besides ham! Can't remember the name of the sandwich I got, however it was very good! Yelp offers free chips and drink with check in, however it was not valid in this location. The lady was nice enough and still took the yelp coupon :) I also ordered for my co-workers and was confusing them a bit, the workers were all patient and super friendly!  (This was on a Saturday)"}
{"text":"This place is brand new and since the one on Wilshire in Santa Monica closed, we made sure we stopped by here on our drive out of chandler to LA.   The employees here were so cheery and polite! They were quick and knowledgeable. You didn't feel like you were burdening them by ordering sandwiches over a holiday ham.   We ordered a few sandwiches which were soooo good! I got a classic ham but subbed multigrain for croissant and cheddar for Swiss. Honestly, I don't think it needed cheese. The tomato was really under ripe but again, the ham was the star and they did not skimp on it either. They honey mustard sauce was overflowing on one side though and it looked like it was an after thought to add like they forgot and squirted it in the side of the sandwich ? Idk, it's not a huge deal. It made it sticky and really messy to eat but it was so yummy that it was tolerable.   My hubs got a turkey Bella. It was perfectly balanced. Between the pepper rings and sweet balsamic, to the ham and turkey with savory mayo.   I so wish we had one in Santa Monica. I may have to trek up to Burbank one day just to try something else."}
{"text":"Always a great meal and fast friendly service. I order the BBQ smoked Stacker sandwich almost every time. Bread is light and the sandwich is just the right size. Check in here, who knows, might get you closer to your meathead badge!"}
{"text":"Came here last night with my wife to pick up the traditional Christmas ham. This location is brand new and thus very clean/organized. They have a set path for the line to make things easier to manage while also allowing customers to sample their different sauces/mustards prior to reaching the registers. Since it's only us two this Christmas, I was a little worried they wouldn't have a ham portion that was small enough. However, I was proved wrong! We were able to get a boneless quarter ham that was the perfect size thanks to the assistance of HoneyBaked staff. Not to mention, they did it with a smile and no sense of being rushed at all! Supreme customer service! Looks like I found my new spot for high quality ham.  PS: at the time of this review, there is no signage above the entrance yet. Just go a few doors to the left of the new Fry's Marketplace (same building) and you'll find it no problem!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't seen or heard of this place earlier! I haven't bought any of their ham but their sandwiches are so good!   From the previous reviews, it looks like there might have been a new manager or something because the quality of the food is amazing! I have been back to the place almost 3x in one month and couldn't be happier! Especially when they have stamp cards!"}
{"text":"I swear, this ham has crack in it...ADDICTING is an understatement, folks. Sheesh! Just go!"}
{"text":"Every Christmas, this is where I pick up my bone in ham.  I always buy the ham with their split pea soup packets they have before the register so I can make split pea soup with the leftover ham.  There is always a line during the holidays but it goes fast because they have a lot of staff working on the register."}
{"text":"Gion is the supervisor. And she is AMAZING. great food and they honor Veterans Day also."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you notice a very clean well kept establishment. We were greeted warmly buy our cashier and he was a bevy of knowledge on the menu. He whipped us up 2 of the best sandwiches me and my employee had in a long wine. Fast efficient friendly and tasty would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"The ham is great but the turkey salad is even better. Fast service and nice, helpful, knowledgeable staff. This is the first HBH store I've eaten in in the south so I expected them to have all the sides like they did at the one near my house in Northern CA and they didn't, but otherwise the place is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Walked right in and picked up a Ham and some other items for Christmas for a house full. They were well staffed and very cordial we were in and out in less than 15 minutes."}
{"text":"If you want a great tasting traditional sandwich this is the place to go! My husband and I both ordered the Bistro Turkey and Brie - honey baked roasted turkey breast, creamy sliced brie, tangy mayo, dijon mustard, lettuce and tomato on fresh sourdough bread. We ordered the combo special which comes with a side salad and a drink.   The turkey was melt in your mouth delicious. There is no fancy restaurant or amazing presentations .... you come here simply for a great tasting sandwich : )"}
{"text":"I ordered the Supreme Sandwich Tray, assorted chips and the Cookie Temptation Tray for a work lunch.   The order arrived a little earlier than expected but no biggie as it was just sandwiches that could be put in the fridge. Everything was awesome!  The ham is obviously my favorite on a croissant lol.  The snickerdoodle cookies were super delish too.  I pass this location on my way home everyday and have been into the store once or twice for a sandwich.  Great location, great delivery and will definitely order from them again.  Lunch for 10 which could of easily fed 15-20 for $100...perfect!"}
{"text":"I just had the best experience here. I ordered a ham on Monday to be picked up on Saturday. It was a mad house there today. The line was going along the side of the building when I got there about 4 pm. First of all I was shocked at how fast the line moved. Before I knew it I was in the building and then at the counter. They were out of the 8 pound ham that I had ordered and instead of making me wait for one to be cut they upgraded me at no charge to an 11 and a half pounder. I was shocked to say the least. I work in customer service and although I would expect to be taken care of I rarely see it happen. This was a great move on their part. I'm a customer for life. I was also impressed to see that the woman behind the counter was able to make this kind of call without getting a manager involved. We were helped by a woman by the name of Litisha, I will be filling out the online comment survey in hopes she is rewarded."}
{"text":"First off, Honey Baked Ham is one of my favorite sandwich shops. I checked in on yelp and received an offer for a free chips and drink with proof of check in.   Their check in coupon has an expiration date of 2013! I obviously just checked in now right in front of you. I had a friend check in thinking maybe I just had an old coupon from forever ago stashed away, but his said the same exact thing.   Joy would not accept either of our check in offers after BOTH of us checked in right in front of her so she could see. Very disappointed that they would not honor their own active offer. If you no longer wish to honor something you are marketing then you should remove it or update it!"}
{"text":"I rarely ever review on Yelp, nor leave a one star review. My guy and I were on a trek for a quick lunch spot around the area and we came about this place; I drive past it nearly everyday so why not? We go to order and this lovely woman, Gion, helped us out with the menu and guided us with choosing what was best for us. He got some kind of gigantic BBQ sandwich and a chocolate chip cookie. I settled for the Mediterranean veggie on toasted ciabatta sans the ranch, vinaigrette, and banana peppers but I added the tasty pesto aioli! Anywho, the lovely sandwich preparer had out food out quickly and neatly, but my bread wasn't toasted.  Slightly r.i.p., but no spook! She just warmed it up for me. I didn't receive a cookie and I waited at the counter for maybe two minutes as the ladies were chatting in the office and then my guy called to get their attention about the cookie. They said it was so biggie! And handed me a frozen cookie! How silly?? Didn't even warm it; just kind of put it in a bag and handed it to me. If that isn't crappy, I don't know what is. I could get better service from a group of goats. However, the service, prices, and quality was pretty nice, but I just wanted an unfrozen cookie. Thank goodness Subway is across the street."}
{"text":"When I pulled up today to get our ham for dinner tomorrow, the line was around the building.  I thought to myself, my gosh this is going to be an all day affair.  Within 15 mins I was out the door with my order and off to run the rest of my errands.   Honey Baked, you have this down to a science!  Great Job today!!! They had a ton of staff on board and were knocking it out left and right!  Everyone was friendly and doing what they were supposed to!  Walmart should cue from them!!! Staff up for busy days, get them and get them out!   Whoohoo!  As good as it gets!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopping by twice to pick up a sammich for lunch, I have always had a good experience with this HBH. There are typically no patrons inside so the ordering process is fast as well as the sammich making process. The prices are fair as well. Kind of a hidden lunch gem if you ask me.  I also do corporate catering with them as well. The managers have been nice enough to work with my company budget and that helps a lot! Box lunches are the way to go for picky employees!"}
{"text":"We ordered a ham fr our Thanksgiving dinner instead of buying one at the store. Payed 81 for the ham and it was dry as the desert we live in. Followed the directions on how to heat it and it came out of the oven dry. The glaze had all fallen off. Long story short extremely dissatisfied with the quality of the ham especially for the prices they charge.    Update: Less than 10 minutes after the complaint on the website I received a phone call from Tony Baca the general manager and he offered to replace the ham. We have received a new ham for our Christmas dinner. Thank you for the great customer service Tony."}
{"text":"Came here for a to go order for lunch. I got a ham sandwich and potato salad. Ham was melt in your mouth. Potato salad was ok, nothing spectacular. Restaurant was really clean!"}
{"text":"It's towards the end of summer and it's hot - it sounds like a spiral sliced ham day! However, I'm just one guy...I can't eat a whole ham by myself...or can I?  Well worry no more ham (and turkey) connoisseurs as the Honeybaked Ham Company serves lunch or ham for 1.  I stumbled upon their store front while on a hunt for a Krispy Kreme following a bad day. I walked away with a ham sandwich and OMG it was like I was transported to the day after Christmas.    They serve turkey too but come on, it's called Honeybaked Ham, not Honeybaked Turkey.  Still, I assume that part is good too.  Sandwiches are so good that it's made my regular stop list.  The sides are standard sandwich fare: bagged chips and can soda but nevermind that - it's just that good.    Just a warning: it's takeout only but now that the weather has started to cool, you can enjoy your ham goodness in your car while on a lunch break."}
{"text":"Love this honey baked ham location. Staff is always friendly and her nice. The location is always clean and the food is good."}
{"text":"If you've never had \"thee honey baked ham\" you are certainly missing out! They have nailed down the best recipe. Don't be fooled by random honey baked hams available at the grocery store, you'll be horribly disappointed. You will pay more, but mark my words, it's worth it! My favorite part is the crunchy coating on the outside of the ham! The meat closest to the bone, yummmmmm! I went here to pick up my ham for Christmas dinner. They have a solid system down pat. There was a semi truck full of hams, they weren't about to run out! As I entered the store, there was roped off area to keep the line well organized. I'll admit, I was bummed to see about 50 people in front of me, but the line moved surprisingly quickly. I like that they have extra items available that you may have not thought about getting..fancy mustards, big sandwich rolls, etc.. I was disappointed that they were out of all side items but one - thankfully it was one we liked, Yukon mashed potatoes..but I was sad that that was it.. I suppose next time I'll go a day earlier..or perhaps they can have more on hand next time."}
{"text":"Never again. Came in to pick up holiday ham. Long line.... Caused by slow and dopey employees. Not enough registers to cash people out causes major confusion for the staff. Had several people BEHIND me in line that paid and walked out the door even before I could hand CASH to the cashier. What a mess. Not worth it. Beware! You'll leave frustrated and not in the holiday spirit."}
{"text":"Just had a D-Lish Tavern Club. First visit to a Honey Baked and I'll definitely be back. Not just because the sandwich was yummy (which it was...bread was awesome, thick cuts of meat, ripe tomatoes...) but the team was even better. Everyone there was super nice and helpful and they wanted to make sure we were enjoying our visit especially due to the reconstruction happening. In a world of waivering levels of service, these guys stand out as being awesome. Loyalty has been bought. Thanks honey baked team!"}
{"text":"Place is terrible. There was one lone poor girl working there which made service insanely slow. Unfortunately we got our sandwiches to go and by the time we realized how disgusting they are we couldn't just take them back. I couldn't even force the sandwich down.   I understand \"honey baked\" is in the title but the sandwich was literally drowning in ooze. It managed to be extremely sweet yet somehow managed to have this sour kick that could only come from cheap dijon mustard. The layer of goo (honey) that was on this sandwich i literally think she took a soup ladle and just poured it over the sandwich. And the bread was this thin, flimsy, like dollar store crescent roll looking thing. There was like no bread to it. It was just crust. Hard to describe really. Good bread can make a bad sandwich at least mediocre, but they can't even manage to have decent bread.   It was honestly in the top 5 worst sandwiches I ever bought in my life. A chain sub shop would have been 1,000 times better, 3 times bigger, and couple dollars cheaper. You couldn't pay me to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"I went early to avoid the crowds and I'm glad I did. They were already busy, but have a great system to direct the flow of traffic. They even have Sheriff's Deputies on duty? Really? Does ham really need a Police presence? Anyway, good food, free samples and staff was numerous and helpful. THANKS HBHCo!"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving ham ruined by Honey Baked Glendale! I bought a quarter ham it was the driest ham I have ever had there was no honey or brown sugar on the ham. No juice anywhere for warming.  Tasteless ham is what you should call it. I'm from California and my last ham was purchased there was so good. Honey Baked of Glendale . $35 down the drain so disappointed."}
{"text":"So yummy ham and moist turkey..picking up ham because we are celebrating our Thanksgiving on Sunday. ... (living las vegas ..everyone in casino industry works on holidays )"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of sandwhiches. I never have been. My husband and I decided to come here because he absolutely loves sandwiches and he has been here once before. The lady we encountered named Gione was so friendly. Apparently the Yelp offer was only suppose to be for California but she gave it to us anyway. You can tell the workers here really enjoy their jobs and have fantastic customer service.  Now on to the food. Just for my husband I decided to try a sandwich. I got the turkey pesto and he got the classic ham. WOW! SOOOOO GOOD. Honestly if all sandwiches tasted like this I would eat them all the time.  We will be back to the Honeybaked ham. Quality food and outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"Horrible management , I've never seen a manager tell an older lady that she was going to escort her out with security because of the huge mistake this honey baked ham made.   If you've visited honey baked ham during the holidays , you will know the lines can get extremely long. Luckily my daughter and I got there when the line wasn't outside the door. I called ahead of time and was told 20minutes in and out , I didn't mind the wait until a young employee yelled if you have cash come to my line . The manager then stepped in stating if you broke line please go back to your previous spot,NOW who in their right mind would leave the front and go back to the end ? Right ...   A numerous unhappy customers spoke up stating that it was unfair that the individuals that were waiting had to wait longer because a huge group were allowed to jump line . Instead of the rightfully unhappy customers being taken care of , the crowd that skipped were given customer service.   30min later I arrived to the front, so my 20mim wait became 50mins . I would to commend the young man at the register for being very polite and helpful, Buck , you exemplified great service to me . You saved this dramatic visit to honey baked ham."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Honeybaked Ham? Every holiday season I can't wait for leftovers to make sandwiches.   I never considered going here out of holiday because I didn't know they make sandwiches or sell by the pound or small hams until recently! Grabbed a Classic Honeybaked sandwich was rather sizeable croissant sandwich and was pretty darn satisfying. I like the honey mustard dressing they put on it.... I should have purchased a bottle. Now that I've had that, It makes perfect sense to serve that on the holidays too.  This is close to the house, I will definitely be coming back for another sandwich soon and a mini ham."}
{"text":"Fast friendly service! sandwich was really good, and large, saved half for dinner. Restaurant was clean and service was quick. Location was easy to find and parking was convenuently right outside the door."}
{"text":"Where do I start, well, let me just make this short and simple....  We had ordered from them the delivery/ catering option to be delivered on the 24th for a Christmas eve party.    40 guests were invited, that's right 40, and would you believe it, they never show up!!!! I mean, no phone call, nothing, the plans  and evenings of 40 HUMAN BEINGS, customers, potential customers, WERE NOT FED and this is on CHRISTMAS EVE for a party, not that easy to just change plans.  And can you believe as the hosts how we felt, this was beyond something terrible, this was a Christmas Nightmare!!! This place was even called the day before at 2:00 to verify the order.  No excuses on this one.    Places like this, who could even possibly do this to their customers, or fail to deliver in this fashion, there should be a law against this, this was just wrong, beware people, on just principle I would say this place in not worthy of ones business, after this incident, I am left speechless, it caused soo much stress and heartache, unbelievable..."}
{"text":"If you're a part of my family you know that no holiday is complete without a Honey Baked Ham.  We came in here to purchase a ham for Easter and I was really surprised by everything they had to offer other than ham! All these delicious looking condiments and RUM CAKE!   It took us awhile because we had to look at everything they were selling. Eventually we picked out three different style condiments; Spicy Chipotle Mayo, Honey Mustard Mayo and Horseradish Sauce.   We arrived at the counter and asked the gentleman a couple questions about the ham we wanted to purchase. He said he was a new employee and would find out the answers for us. I really appreciate that he was willing to step away and help a customer other than just attend to the register.  He came back with the answers we needed and we decided to buy an 8 pounder.   As always the service we received was fantastic and the ham tastes delicious! I would like to come back here to try some of the sandwiches they have to offer, and buy a rum cake!"}
{"text":"The ham we got was fantastic. Tons of flavor, virtually melts in your mouth. Great for the family dinner and goes great with pineapple and their honey mustard. Also makes for the best leftovers and sandwiches. 5/5"}
{"text":"Quick bite spot for lunch. Great friendly staff who care. Once I realized this was an eat-in place I knew it would become a regular in my lunch break places. You gotta try all the sandwiches and breads."}
{"text":"I love honey baked ham so I decided to come here.  I ordered 1/2 sandwich and cup of soup and my wife ordered cup of soup for 14 dollars.  Do you remember the old Wendy's commercials that used to say, \"where's the beef\"?.  Well just substitute ham.  There were three tiny pieces of ham on the sandwich.  I was so disappointed.  I guess for that price I was expecting a chompies size sandwich.  Now I have to go to Wendy's because I am still hungry."}
{"text":"POLICY & Customer Service Sucks!  My mom ordered in advance and when it was time for her to pick it up. The cashier said they cannot find the list of her orders.  The belgian chocolate  mousse, 1 whole boneless ham, mac and cheese and mash potato she ordered all of this and never got any of it. Not even one!   So there is NO USE ORDERING IN ADVANCE! YOU WILL NOT GET WHAT YOU ORDERED!  You are just wasting your time and it will ruined your whole day!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time and it is awesome. Food is fresh and delicous and the staff is kind and friendly. Oddly enough im not a fan of ham but it delicious and they also have oven roasted and smoked turkey if your not into ham either. The turkey is amazing."}
{"text":"I've ordered hams from Honeybaked over the years and they are the best hams I've ever eaten.  They have a brown sugar candied coating on the outside that makes them sweet and tasty.  The meat is smoked for hours and is perfectly cooked.  Then they slice the ham perfectly so it is easy to serve on plates or sandwiches, eat, and store.  I've never had better ham than Honeybaked.  This Thanksgiving, in addition to brining and cooking our own turkey, we purchased a 2.5lb turkey breast from Honeybaked.  They perform a very similar process on the turkey as they do with their hams.  The turkey had that smoky flavor, a smoke ring, and that yummy brown sugar coating on the outside.  It was delicious.  Now, if I had to choose between a Honeybaked ham and a Honeybaked turkey for my last meal on earth, I'm going to choose the ham, hands down!"}
{"text":"When I walked in not one person was in there. (my kinda place!). I'd never been in there before and was craving a sandwich. I got the Ham & Turkey Pesto sandwich. Ham, Smoked Turkey, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomato, red onion and pesto aioli on multigrain flatbread. When I got home I was surprised it wasn't wrapped in fancy logo wrapping. I LIKED THAT! It made me feel like a kid again. Immediately it took me back to when my mom would make my lunch for my field trip and it was always a yummy surprise. I took a bite and it was delicious! The ham was like my moms ham on Thanksgiving! It's so sweet and candy-like. I didn't add any of my own \"fixin's\" to this sandwich which is a huge plus. The staff was super friendly and gave me a tour of the menu as well as samples if I liked. I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. Go somewhere else. The sandwich was not good and was expensive. We didn't even finish our food. Also, they were out of a lot of things that we wanted and that we saw people come in to buy."}
{"text":"For a bran new point of business pretty well organized.  The manager on duty and I pologize for not remembering her name knew everything and answered every question the new staff member had.  Picked up a couple hams for the holidays and they were excellent like Honeybaked hams always are."}
{"text":"My review is based on the sandwiches and this place never disappoints! My personal favorite is the classic turkey sandwich, as everything is always very fresh and flavorful. You must try the mandarin pineapple salad, it's so simple yet so delicious! The ladies working behind the counter are always so nice, cheerful, and make you feel very welcome."}
{"text":"Yes I do not eat meat- no this place doesn't have much for a vegetarian. But I am not one to judge based on bias food needs. I think this place has great sandwiches (which you can personalize) and great sides. A little pricey (2$ for a can of Cola and 2$ for a small cup of potato salad) but pretty darn good.  The snickerdoodle cookies are to die for, and they have all manner of types of chips and sides to go with whatever you are in need of.   I will try a cheese sandwich one of these days, with the yummy tater salad!"}
{"text":"I visited on a Wednesday.  The rotational soup is Creamy Chicken & Wild Rice. There are different soups on different days. The creamy chicken soup was savory with the delicious spices and wild rice.  Also, I got a classic smoked turkey  sandwich with a creamy honey mustard. It was very tasty.  The pickles are good too.  Also, the server lady was very sweet and made my visit a pleasure."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Customer service we received wasn't up to par -- guy wasnt able to answer simple questions regarding products they sell. Spoke with store manager who took care of the situation really well, but not blown away with their products. Ended up throwing a Turkey in our roaster bc everyone was disappointed on Thxgiving :/"}
{"text":"Customer service was good, but my sandwich was not.  I had roast beef and cheddar and it came on a croissant.  The croissant was like a brick.  The roast beef did not taste very good to me, and they forgot to put the cheddar cheese on it. Way too much horseradish sauce. So I really didn't eat much of it."}
{"text":"The meatloaf sucks!  We love their ham, sandwiches and sides, but  yesterday my wife bought a meatloaf and side of loaded mashed potatoes from Honeybaked Ham.  What a horrible meal.  The meatloaf is dense and has a thick layer of ketchup.  When I say dense, I mean it is about the size and density of a brick.  The taste was not actually bad (once you get past the ketchup), but texture is something I just could not adjust to.  The mashed potatoes -loaded style- had bacon, chunks of potato, and probably sour cream and cheese.  Not suited to my taste.   I will buy from them again, just will stick to the ham!"}
{"text":"This was our first time in the store. It is so clean, bright and airy.  Kelvin helped me select my sandwich. Which was the Tavern. Absolutely delicious. I loved the sauce on the delicious multi grain bread.  The ham salad was made with TLC and was delicious as well.  We also met another gentleman with a fabulous voice. He should be on the radio.  I am sorry that his name slipped my mind.  We will definitely be back.  They have a great Valentine day special!!!   Dawn"}
{"text":"Like so many others, I visited this Honeybaked location late in the evening on the Thursday before Christmas. I was expecting a madhouse. Maybe my timing was just perfect, because it was a very brief wait. I have never bought a ham from Honeybaked (or a Christmas ham at ALL, for that matter!) so I had lots of questions. The gal who helped me, I believe named Erica, was a superstar. She was patient, knowledgeable and friendly. She never made me feel like my questions were silly and never once rushed me. She seemed enthusiastic to pick out a perfect ham for my needs and when an employee takes such pride in their product, it really resonates with you.  The store was clean, well-organized and prepared to handle the influx of holiday traffic. Even at that late hour on Dec 22, they still appeared to have plenty of inventory.  I selected a perfect 5 lb bone-in ham for about $40 and it was an excellent choice. The family was happy with the ham and I was happy there were leftovers!"}
{"text":"So I have driven past this HoneyBaked location I don't even know how many times, but decided to actually stop and have lunch.  Our family has really enjoyed the high quality specialty ham and turkey (among other things) that they offer, mainly during the holiday season.  No, this is not your garden variety type of meat; it's definitely higher-end, and the quality shows.  I decided on their Ham Classic sandwich ($6.49) on a flaky croissant with the basic toppings of tomato, lettuce, mustard.  The sandwich was very tasty and the ham...oh yes...really delicious as I remember. Super Yum! Maybe I'll order their turkey or even ham salad the next time I stop.  I of course Checked-In as they were offering a free soda and bag of chips, but the cashier didn't know what I was talking about, so I explained how it usually works.  The manager said, \"We don't do Yelp, but I will go ahead and give you the chips and soda for free.  The SKU on Yelp doesn't work in our system; not every store honors Yelp.\"  Ok, thanks manager, much appreciated.  I found the store/café to be clean and bright, with various ads showcasing their specialties.  The various employees were helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs."}
{"text":"I was craving a Honey Baked Ham sandwich and since it is close, I had to satisfy my palate.  So glad I did. Everything about that sandwich was perfect. The croissant, the meat (for sure), the mayo (they mix it there), the honey mustard, and the fresh lettuce and tomato. Oh my...I want another one..."}
{"text":"Ordered the daily special, asked not to have sprouts on the sandwich and they said they couldn't eliminate anything from the sandwich. Not the first time this happened . They need to step up their customer service!"}
{"text":"Costco now sells really good Honey Baked Hams.  and if you have never had a REAL HONEY BAKED HAM as in FROM HONEYBAKED HAM Co. on Cactus Rd then you can't die just yet.  You must at least once in your life have one from here.  I only buy them around holidays like Christmas and I have to wait in a big ass long line just to pick the ham up.  You must  pre-order your ham in advance to guarantee you get one for Christmas!    So as I stand in the line, I tell myself that it would be so much better if I just decided to buy a ham in September sometime, or in July-- but I forget.  Not that waiting in the line is so bad, they have lots of free samples of food and there are usually nice people around you to make conversation with- ever so often an angry husband who must not have  know what he was getting himself into when he said \"sure- I'll run and pick up the ham, honey\".  So this ham..... it is this perfect crunchy outer sugary glaze that just makes my mouth water thinking about it.  You need to go to Honeybaked Ham. Like FOR REAL."}
{"text":"After enjoying a Honey Baked Ham last Christmas, we decided to get one this year, instead of Turkey. I stopped in today, a little after 12:00 and was greeted by a friendly staff ready to answer any questions, make recommendations and show you a variety of hams, turkeys ( roasted or smoked ) to allow you to pick the one you want. I chose my ham, while I enjoyed the turkey samples they had available and was out the door. The staff was friendly, gave great service and I know we will enjoy our Christmas diner thanks to Honey Baked Ham."}
{"text":"They forgot to put a salad in our order and we didn't notice it until we got home. We went back to retrieve are missing salad and they gave us lip. They tried to tell us we had our salad! Then without any apologies they said well okay. Sandwiches that we had eaten already we're mediocre-at-best. But the lack of service is what will keep us away."}
{"text":"I love the food here. But what made my experience five-stars was the service I received while ordering and dining in. The staff are very friendly. I eat here occasionally and will likely be back sooner than usual!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't like Honey Baked Ham?  I thought this is where you bought whole hams for holidays, never knew it had a Cafe inside.  Glad we stopped in.  I had a classic ham sandwich with soup. Bother were awesome! Price was a little higher than other places, but I didn't feel like it was too high considering the quality of the food.  I was disappointed in the fact that they were having problems with the soda machine. When we told them about it they said they knew about it already. I would of thought if it was an ongoing problem them should fix it rather than leave it that way. It was the Coke, Mr. Pibb, and Diet coke. That's a shame. I would have added a star if that would of been taken care of in the 30 minutes we sat and ate out lunch :/  Food was good,  wish maybe they would shave the ham, or maybe thinner so it's not so big on the sandwich.  We will come back again and see if any changes are made :)"}
{"text":"I use to think that Honeybaked Ham only sold Ham products so I never bothered because I dont eat beef or pork. When I found out they sell turkey products I was so happy. I actually got a sample when they had a booth in Ballantyne. I take my son here often and they know us. I went alone one day and couldnt remember exactly what he usually gets and the lady says I know what he gets LOL that was pretty awesome on top of the fact that they pile the meat on the sandwich and the slices are thick! They are not cheap and its awesome! Definitely a thumbs up, matter fact Im do for a sandwich soon LOL"}
{"text":"Eh, their chicken salad wasn't anything special.  Not horrible, but not really worth going out of your way for either.  Maybe next time I'll try the ham.  Lol."}
{"text":"Great place to get a sandwich for lunch that actually tastes good and makes you enjoy eating it. The ham and turkey are awesome and they never disappoint. Staff is friendly and quick. You must take some home and use the bone from the ham to make the split pea soup mix they sell. SOOO good!"}
{"text":"We haven't been to honey baked ham in forever.  This particular one was a great experience.  We came in for lunch and they weren't busy. I don't know why. The food was delicious and all the employees were friendly and accommodating.    Charmaine immediately greeted us on entering and handed us a menu explaining everything.   The potato soup was fresh, hot and spot on for soup!!  The croissants were fantastic and I had chicken salad on mine. It was so satisfying and filling.  My husband got ham on his croissant sandwich and said it was delicious as well.   They were quick at preparing and serving out meals. The establishment was very clean and inviting.    If you check in you get a free drink and bag chips!! Can't beat that because a sandwich and soup is $8 plus a free bag of chips and drink.    They have many meals to take home and cook too!!"}
{"text":"My first time in a honey baked ham store. I just needed a ham bone and didn't see one at my local grocer so I gave this place a try. They had them - a whole freezer full of them. They have a set up where you buy the bone, buy a packet of soup mix and just add water to make one of three soups: Mixed Bean, White Bean or Split Pea.  I was the only one in the store, but the associate was great. I was welcomed right upon walking in. The associate was friendly, volunteered cooking tips and was forthcoming with product details.   The ham bones were around 4.5lb / $10. They were frozen and were supposed to be used within 5 days of thawing. The store associate said she has made soup with them still frozen though.   The bone itself had a lot of meat on it. The store associate said it would fall apart when cooked and add meat and flavor to the dish. (I didn't have a pot big enough to fit the bone plus my soup ingredients so I ended up removing some of the meat before cooking.)   I'll definitely give this place a try in the future. You can also just stop in here for a lunch sandwich."}
{"text":"I was looking for a w lunch spot while out shopping.  This cafe came to mind. I was greeted quickly by the cashier. She was quick and friendly.  I ordered the classic ham sandwich with a few custom requests. I ordered it plain- no mayo or honey mustard and on wheat bread instead of a croissant. The cashier had no problem customizing my sandwich.  Greatly appreciated!   The sandwich was yummy! Real ham off the bone. Im glad I ordered it plain because I tried the packet of honey mustard and was it gross! Too sweet and more like ham glaze! Not good uncooked.  I also checked in and used the free chips and drink offer! Thanks Yelp!"}
{"text":"Thanksgiving shopping is DONE! We went to HoneyBaked early Sunday afternoon and got the ham and the turkey and a few fixings. Very helpful staff who walked us through what we wanted and helped us determine the right quantities. It sure isn't cheap though!  This stuff doesn't have to be bought the day before, ya know? You can get it a little earlier because the line tends to grow as the holidays approach."}
{"text":"Ok I officially love the guys who work here!! Completely amazing customer service!!! I gotta say I can be a pretty picky eater and usually ask to change at least one thing about a menu item. Ya, servers see me and run!!!  I ordered the prime roast beef and they switched out the cheese, bread, and took off the condiments, and even heated it for me!!! All while joking with me and my friend, and they even brought the order over to our table. I wish I could remember their names! My friend ordered one of the ham clubs and he also really liked it. These sandwiches are soo good! And will keep you full all day. I'm coming back for the salads and soup!:)"}
{"text":"I love this place. I like the classic ham sandwich. The food is yummy. You can buy sides when you don't cook. You get a stamp card for free food. Plus, they are always super nice."}
{"text":"Got a ham from them for my employees and they just loved it so much they brought me some.  Plan on going back soon."}
{"text":"I always wait unit the last minute to get the Christmas Ham, Turkey, or whatever it is I need. Even if it is just a bottle of their delicious mustard, or mayo, you are airing a good 20 min before even entering the place. The line wraps all around the building. That is only after you sit an additional ten minutes in the parking lot line waiting for a spot to open up. It is eel worth it though their spiral honey hams are very toothsome to say the least.   For being so hectic and insane due to the holidays, the staff is still really cool and pleasant.   I really do not come here except for Christmas. Although I am a man of tradition, next year I will definitely try to break my tradition of coming here last minute. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"OK so this Christmas I decided to make things easy for myself in the cooking department, considering I just cooked a full on feast for Thanksgiving.  I decided to have a Honeybaked ham for my Christmas dinner and I will make all of the delicious sides which would be simple!  The Ham was delicious, picked it up the day before Christmas, yes waited in a 40 minute line, I was expecting that so no shock, lol.  It was $38 bucks for a ham that fed 8 people a generous portion, I think it was a great deal for taste, price and convenience.  You don't even have to bake or heat it up, simply pull it out and let it rest for an hour and you are ready to go. That is key that you serve this ham at room temperature!  I suggest making your own sides as they are costly and in my opinion their sides are not as good as what you can do on your own. They are called Honeybaked ham for a reason and that is what you should buy :)  All I had to do was my sides, green beans and bacon, brown sugar baked yams, and scalloped potatoes. It was an easy Holiday dinner and it left a lot more time for talking, snapping pics and laughing with family and friends!  I will be doing a repeat of this next year for my Christmas dinner!!!  I am a very happy customer!"}
{"text":"Ordered a ham and pie for Thanksgiving.  I arrived as soon as they opened the day before Thanksgiving to find that there were only about 5 people in line and they didn't pre-purchase online, I had, so I walked straight to the front of the purchased online line.  I was in and out in 5 minutes.  Customer service was friendly and helpful and of course everyone enjoyed the ham I served.  Should I ever be crazy enough to host Thanksgiving again, I will be back!"}
{"text":"This by far has the freshest ingredients available for any luncheon.  The staff here has excellent customer service and they always have treated me like family. My company uses them a few times during the year for catering and everyone loves their sandwiches."}
{"text":"I will never go back to this location. They are ripping people off and they say it's ok. They charge an extra city tax on all of their items.  I will now go to the Phoenix HoneyBaked ham store and wait in a longer line. Disgusting."}
{"text":"The food was excellent as were most of the staff. The guy who took my order was very curt, borderline rude. Put him in another position and this place is a great lunch spot!"}
{"text":"We ordered ham last thanksgiving .. And I love this place we order every year when we were in the southwest side of town... We're new here in northwest but quality should always be similar... The ham was a very salty ;( my family barely ate it and we spent 60$ it got wasted .."}
{"text":"Worst online order system ever.  Let me order a ham for new years eve for pickup after four.  Showed up at 4:17 and it was closed!!!  And the worst thing was not one person from the store called me to make me aware.  I understand that they close early but their online system should reflect pickup times that are correct according to holiday hours.  Rude Manager and unhelpful."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for a quick and delicious sandwich. The broccoli salad was very good too, its balanced well. Very yummy."}
{"text":"I came in all they had was ham and turkey. I came all the way from unlv. I am very disappointed; no soup no nothing"}
