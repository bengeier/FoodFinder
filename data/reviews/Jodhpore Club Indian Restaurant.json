{"text":"To start of I had not planned to dine at Jodhpur Club, but when our original choice was closed we were forced to...and I dare say I wish we hadn't. All the chicken we were served was raw from the pakoras to the jodhpurs curry. When we made this known to the server he was apologetic and quietly agreed to change the dishes I presume to avoid the other customers from noticing. After waiting while trying to forget the glaring pink chicken in our plates we got our new dishes a vegetable biryani and lamb roganjosh. The biryani had raw potatoes and roganjosh had the exact same gravy that the raw chicken was in. Gross! The female server (probably the same one mentioned in a review here) got offended when we alerted her of this and promptly told us \"we have nothing for you here!\" (which I guess meant cooked food).

Overall horrible food and even worse service! Don't waste your time and money!"}
{"text":"On one random late Saturday afternoon we spotted this place as we walked by and realized that we were in dire need of a serious Indian food fix. Too bad it didn't satisfy our palettes, as I really wanted to like this place given how friendly the manager/owner was and how I felt like I was helping the owner out by providing what appeared to be much-needed business (the place was empty). We picked some dishes off their menu that sounded good for impromptu take-out, so obviously I can only comment on the quality of the food, not the service. 

Their best dish was the rice. Now, that might seem like a bit of an insult, but seriously, that rice--which consisted of a blend of seasonings and some other little food stuffs--was wonderful. I'd *almost* go back there for that alone. The rest of it (chicken korma, naan, pakoras) was just \"meh\", but the palak paneer had an unusual, sickly sweet flavour that was not what I usually expect from the dish. 

The other concern I had with the food was how quickly our take-out was ready; we were told to come back in 10 minutes after we had placed the order. Seriously? I know fast service is great, but it is a bit disconcerting to know that your food is pretty much already prepared and is waiting to be reheated. So I dunno, maybe I've been watching Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares too much lately, but this is generally a sign of not so great food. And with our recent experience at Jodhpore Club, I'd have to agree."}
{"text":"i use to live around the corner and i never had problems with this place. the food itself is OK, hence the 3 stars. this was some years ago though so maybe something has changed. i assume this is a family owned restaurant for i'd always see children in the kitchen (is that safe?). nether the less, these people have put up with my antics when coming home from an art opening a little tipsy & sitting in the middle of the restaurant waiting for my order shamelessly. i would always get the same thing: samosas, garlic & pea naan and occasionally a butter chicken dish. the veggie samosas were always good, a little on the greasy side but they were pretty big and cheap. the best was their garlic & pea naan bread. it was often baked to perfection and delicious. i could never get enough of it, a perfect companion to the butter chicken. i never recalled getting uncooked chicken or anything amiss so reading the other reviews has me scratching my head. maybe i'd dodged another bullet, i seem to dodge a lot of those with poorly rated restaurants. stomach of steel? who knows. either way, i'd probably come back here to see if much has changed. i bet the prices have gone up but i doubt the recipes have changed. try their samosas & naan bread, both should be AOK!"}
{"text":"I really like this place, and find myself wanting to return, even when I'm on the other side of town. The food is quite good, and there are numerous vegetarian options which is just great (though I have heard that the meat dishes are good too).

I've been here with friends and family, and never had anyone say a bad thing about it. The family staff can be a bit forgetful at times with orders, but they work very hard, and the food more than makes up for it. I would not describe the food as cheap, but you get what you pay for. Everyone is real friendly too. Whenever I return to Baldwin Village, this is always my top pic."}
{"text":"This place is really good. Their paneer makhani is the best and so is the channa masala! The portions are decent and so is the price. Best of all, the staff was quick and very friendly. I will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for their lunch buffet recently ($10) they had around 9 items including naan and white rice. Had 3 vegetarian curries composed of various lentil based elements, cauliflower, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, mutton (very boney) and gulab jamun (those sweet balls in a sugary syrup) and 4 flavours of ice cream of which only the vanilla and chocolate had new tubs whilst the mango and strawberry had only next to nothing.

Just thought I'd add this in here to go with my original review. 
This wouldn't be my first choice for a lunch special on Baldwin, but it's hardly busy so if you want a more quiet place, pick this over Gateways!"}
{"text":"update on my review: still... 2-3 stars.

They have a high chair for babies, but the place would be a bit too narrow to manoeuvre around with a stroller.

Ordered Mattar paneer, garlic naan (I still prefer the garlic naan from The Host, in Yorkville: fresh ingredients used there), an eggplant dish, and pulao paneer ($6.50 for a small bowl).  

I have yet to experience their buffet, and it wasn't being served on the Monday that I last visited this place on.

Either I'm allergic to an ingredient or something was off this time.  Not in taste, but in the nasty bout that ensued about 30 min. after we left the restaurant.  I enjoyed my meal enough, and was pleased that those working there enjoyed babies, but I'm very confused about what to do about the tasty-enough and convenient leftovers.  

Would I go again?  At some point, probably."}
