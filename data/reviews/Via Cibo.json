{"text":"1) Margherita pizza ($10) Nice thin crust with a good amount of cheese. Made in a stone oven.   2) Broccolini and sausage pasta ($13) Linguini was al dente, generous amount of sausage and broccolini. Good portion.   The restaurant is a nice space. The decor was well done. The prices are a bit high for lunch but for dinner, this would be a good option."}
{"text":"I asked the blonde waiter for a pepper, she replied in angry tone \"its all over there no need to ask\" food below average.."}
{"text":"Stopped in after the supper rush and weren't too sure what to order and weren't really familiar with the menu. We waited a few minutes in line and then when at the cashier were able to read the menu behind, the girl was nice and helped us order a little for take-out. The staff were friendly, the restaurant was clean and modern and brand new. There was a nice place to wait while it was being prepared and could watch the people behind the glass prepare  our take-out meals. We ordered stuffed pasta shells (there were 5 which is a small serving for $15 which was $3 per stuffed shell! ouch) then my friend got chicken penne and a caprese salad all for $46 and it was a small take out bag and containers. The servings were small and the prices were more than I would usually pay for such a small serving. We were offered gelato samples while we were waiting. Just a new restaurant in the community - tried, not very impressed with portion vs price. Done with that."}
{"text":"We have to give it 5 stars cuz there isn't 10!! Awesome ambience food and service!!!! Love i, recommend it, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"truly enjoy the food in this place. unfortunately i had one bad experience, after having a portobello mushroom and goat cheese sandwich and was violently ill for 2 days. I couldn't even go back for at least a month and when finely r decided to go back i was only able to order the pizza. the four cheese pizza very tasty however to thin for my likening."}
{"text":"Just had take out from here.... Wow..... How is it possible for a restaurant to go down hill this fast.  Dined in when they were just opening up and was Wow'd.  But tonight 1 of the 2 meatball sandwiches literally didn't have any meat and the other one didn't have meatballs....   When we called to complain no one answered the phone and their voice mail was full.  Think this will be a pass."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant if you want to eat Italian food. I've only tried the pollo alla Grillia and I would have it again. It is a clean place an they offer Italian sodas. overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Pasta (linguine w sausage & broccolini) was delicious & spicy, and the Caesar salad was pretty good, too. Prices were decent. Based on that, I would have given it 4 stars. We ordered delivery so I can't comment on the service. However, the portobello and goat cheese flatbread was no good, it looked nothing like the picture on the menu and was basically an extremely soggy flour tortilla rolled up with a bunch of mushrooms, tomatoes, and a couple bits of goat cheese inside; eww!  If we had been in the restaurant I would have 100% sent it back. It was like a salad/wet taco hybrid...most of it got thrown in the garbage. I would definitely order the pasta again, but the flatbread was definitely the low point of the meal."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent food.  Restaurant is the type where you order from the counter from a menu on a board and then sit down with a number on a stick to indicate where the servers should deliver your food. Atmosphere is quite stylish and comfortable, but where this place shines is the food.  My wife and I had the Gnocchi, the Calabrese Sausage Piadina, and a side Polpette. Altogether the total was around $35. No drinks, but we ended up taking half of the gnocchi home with us.  The gnocchi comes in an amazing Gorgonzola cream sauce with pancetta and slow-roasted tomatoes. So good that I was scrapping the bowl when filling the takeout container so I wouldn't lose a drop.  The Piadina is an Italian chewy flatbread. In this case it is prepared as a wrap. The homemade sausage is delicious complimented by the grilled vegetables it is served with. This was my second time getting this dish.  The side polpette are meatballs served in a small dish of tomato sauce. The meat is lean enough without losing flavour or tenderness and the sauce is great. There is a panino sandwich featuring the polpette that I want to try next time.  Had we the room, we would have ordered something from the dessert menu. The gelato alone came in interesting flavours like chocolate sea salt caramel and peanut butter along with more traditional flavours like vanilla and lemon sorbet. There is also a menu item where they put a gelato flavour and Nutella in a Piadina.  I would definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I had a portobello mushroom flatbread wrap for dinner last night. It wasn't very good. I actually felt like purging after eating it. Which isn't something I've often experienced.   I expected a fresh baked flatbread like Sal's Flatbread, but it was really just a wrap using what seemed to be a pre-made thin crust pizza shell. My wife's pasta was ok, but pretty overcooked.  Prices are also too high for the fast casual quality of food offered by Via Cibo. Maybe for $8-10 -- but at $12-16 for this lower quality food, I will not be back.   Spend your takeout dollars elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Went for supper around 7:00pm and the place was about 1/3 full. I've liked the concept that Via Cibo presents, but the details are in the execution. There is a mix of individual and communal tables. The rough hewn wood surfaces add to the \"street food\" atmosphere.  I ordered the specials (mushroom soup & mushroom pizza) and my partner has the pasta primavera and asked for added shrimp.  Soup flavour was good and pizza was good (I love stone fired thin crust) but both specials were listed as having a \"medley of mushrooms\". All I saw were sliced button mushrooms. Further, I'm not a big fan of garnishing a cream based soup with chopped parsley. Leave the parsley for the clear brothed soups.   Our biggest concern was with the added shrimp in the primavera. We don't think they were properly cooked.   Overall a good concept, but if you do go, stick with the tried and true classics."}
{"text":"Fine dining it's not. I've eaten in their Ottawa (Kanata) outlet (chicken parm) and was actually a bit disappointed in how it was over cooked. However, I was intrigued by the concept.  This time it was the country hills outlet. This time I had the starter Ceasar salad and the Prosciutto Piadina. Much better. My wife (a very finicky eater) had the Alfredo. Also well done  Service was very fast. I think it took us more time to order than it took to prepare. Pricing is reasonable but perhaps a bit high for the quality."}
{"text":"I loooove eating here. Theyre brunch is amazing (all off it) but my personal fav is the Portobello piadina. The portions are great and if you're concerned about how \"expensive\" it is just remember you get what you pay for!   Their brownies are also to die for.  The downside? 90% of the people who work there are insanely unpleasant. They're moody, cold and straight up awful to interact with. One guy in particular, tall brown haired guy, is a total douche as well as most of the women who work there.  The few that are pleasant are SO wonderful."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and service is quite nice, however the menu items do seem a bit overpriced for the quality/quantity you receive. They do have a good desert and drinks section. Would come here for a causal date for drinks or a quick desert to share."}
{"text":"This was a great find! We had a delicious meal, the concept is refreshing, and the service was great. Try the Caesar salad, the pasta al ragu di ossobuco, and my fave, the piadina pollo balsamico! We were less thrilled with the Tuscan fries, though they were good too. We'll definitely be back to try more from their menu."}
{"text":"I've found my new favortie restaurant!!!!!  I couldn't wait for this place to open and I must say it was worth the wait. My man and I went opening night and it was awesome. We walked in and there were already a few people inside. We walked up to the counter and were greeted by a friendly young man who seemed very eager to take our orders. Once we decided on what we were having we place the order and were given a number for our table, and were directed down the counter to the cashier. Another young man greeted us there and took our drink order and we payed. I have to say all the staff seemed happy to be there and there was excitement in the air. We took our drinks and found a table and I would have to say not even 15mins later we had our food! I couldn't believe how quick it was so impressive!  The tuscan fries are to die for! And the pasta was cooked to prefection I was totally blown away with how delicious everything was!  I will definitelybe returning on a regular basis to this place in the future."}
{"text":"When it first opened up, I fell in love with this place.  Sadly, it seems like either there was a change in ownership or chefs.  The quality of food has gone down dramatically since about two (or somewhat) years ago.  I rarely go there anymore.  But when I do go, I am extremely disappointed.  Also, I don't know what they do with their food but I usually get sick.  (gas, bloating, diarrhea, indigestion)  I would like to have the old Via Cibo back.  It was my favourite place to go to."}
{"text":"I really liked it here. Good food & atmosphere. I had the feature, which was the Gnocchi and it was the best I've ever had. Will come back 100%"}
{"text":"I picked up one of the sandwiches to go. It was fresh and good quality, though a bit too bready. I like the look of the menu and look forward to returning."}
{"text":"We were supposed to go elsewhere for lunch, and ended up here. I was a little upset at first as I had not done my homework on this place. We were very pleasantly surprised. My husband and I ordered a pizza, and our friends ordered a salad and sandwich (apologies as I cannot remember off hand the exact items). All items were delicious and 'healthful'. The manager (Tabrez - hope I have spelt your name correctly) realized it was our first time there, and came by to ensure everything was in order. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"I was somewhat of a regular here since it opened, and this place has always been a hit and miss.  The cook and wait staff is constantly changing, so food quality, taste and portions are inconsistent.  I am not suggesting the food is not good ... just unpredictable, a gamble and inconsistent.  The service is always bad - rude staff, impatient staff, weird ordering system.  Sadly you have pay before you get your food/service, so tipping becomes very hard (so I give just 10% instead of the customary 15%).  I had complained once a year ago (on their FB page) and the owner/manager/staff/? responded by saying s/he will get back to be shortly.  S/he never did.  So I stopped going.  Recently my friends started saying good things once again, and after a few months I went back last Sunday.  Bad decision!!  I won't be back ever again and I decided to write this review on Yelp.    Last Sunday my usual dish (Brocollini, Sausage and Penne) was overdosed with oil, and it tasted markedly different.  I also pre-ordered/pre-paid for an espresso and asked for it after the meal, and I had to ask 2 further times before I had to confront the staff one final time by threatening to leave."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!   I just went there for lunch and there is only one word that describes it accurately DISGUSTING.   Not only did we spend $45 for lunch but the food was not even good.   I ordered a Pizza and it was RAW DOUGH and all the toppings were sliding off and in general you could tell the pizza was undercooked.  When I approached someone who worked there their response was \"that is how it is supposed to be - mushy\" \"that is how we cook our pizza here\"  Although I was clearly unsatisfied, no one came to follow up for me and there didn't seem to be a manager in site.     I work just around the corner from there and needless to say I will never be back.  My advise, save your money and go to the superstore across the street who makes better fresh pizza then the \"Italian\" place."}
{"text":"The low number of stars is regarding customer service, not the quality of food. We've been to Via Cibo a number of times and have enjoyed the food each time. Last night, we dropped in for a quick dinner - my husband ordered the calabrese piadina and I ordered the pasta pomodoro. They brought the wrong dish out for my husband. He took it back, the staff apologized and said they'd get him what he'd ordered. After he came back and sat down, a staff person walked over to our table and said she had punched in the wrong dish and there was a price discrepancy between what he'd ordered and what he'd been charged (the piadina he wanted was a couple of dollars more than the dish he'd been charged for). The difference was negligible. I'm surprised the staff chose to address the matter as they did. From a customer perspective, the restaurant should simply apologize for the error and correct it. End of story. Approaching the customer after the fact with the expectation that the customer follow you back to the cash register and pay a few dollars' difference makes for a pretty shabby customer experience. C'mon, Via Cibo. Get it togther."}
{"text":"This place is great for anyone looking for a quick bite to eat. Food comes out fast and the atmosphere is very nice. I've had the pomodoro pasta, spaghetti carbonara, margherita pizza and the caesar salad. All were tasty and good portions. The setup of this place is very nice, almost like a mini maze. You first order your food from the board and then walk down and pay. You also can see the chefs making your food which is a plus. Definitely a nice hangout spot and I plan to come back."}
{"text":"My prosciutto and arugula pizza wasn't good at all.  Too much arugula and balsamic reduction.   Not enough pizza sauce.  All I tasted was the sourness and the vinegar reduction.   Dough was too chewy and tough.   $3 for a can of ice tea is ridiculous.  I has better Italian soda .  Only had 2 choices of flavor.  Lemon or orange.   I had the lemon and it was way too sour (and I generally love sour). The kids had the penne pomodoro with meatballs.   It is just ok."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last week for a quick dinner. Prices are amazing - service was great. Food was to die for.  Truly a great restaurant  experience  and  I will return with my family."}
{"text":"Love the chicken salad and truffle fries. Everything there looks good. Hardly fast food tho, but easier access than the 17th Ave location. Expensive."}
{"text":"The gnocchi was so fresh and heavenly and the pollo pesto pizza was very satisfying. They do not skimp on ricotta cheese on their kale salad, so good! It was very quick and affordable and we definitely would go again if in that area :)"}
{"text":"Crap de la crap.. Meatballs sandwich.. Supposed to be panini...a piece of cheap baguette with 4 very salty meatballs...terrible...Costco serves a better sandwich... please stop calling it Italian street food...nobody in Italy would ever eat this..."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times since they opened. Consistant every time. Food was good for the price. Ive tried a few things on the menu. Wasnt a fan of the tuscan fries, but the pizza was really good. Pastas are as good as your gonna get in the area. Very fast service. Ill be going back for sure."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and loved it both times. The food is excellent - as another poster said, it is restaurant quality for a more affordable price. The service is also friendly, welcoming, and unpretentious. The decor has that modern, futuristic style to it, and since it is quite new, everything is still spotless. I plan to dine here regularly this year."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of times and the pizza oven was not working. The decor is beautiful and staff are very friendly and willing to accommodate you.  We ordered a side of meatballs with our meal that appeared raw on the inside. We presented this to the server and she willingly replaced them. The second order also appeared raw on the inside. I am of Italian descent and have never served meatballs that were this pinkish red inside. I gave up on these and left them unfinished.   Other than than the meatballs the sauce was pretty good. If you are going to specialize in serving simple Italian food it should be prefected......or at least fully cooked. Maybe a cooking thermometer should be used."}
{"text":"FOOD: 4 based on sandwiches, BUT a 1/5 or 2/5 based on pasta.  I came during their soft opening and ordered a meatball flatbread and a steak panino sandwich. Both were pretty good   I came back for their grand opening since I wanted to try their other items. Dropped in the restaurant the second day of grand opening to get their pasta and the steak sandwich.  The STEAK SANDWICH is still good although the slices of meat were inconsistent with my first try. I guess each cook slices it differently and they haven't set a standard yet.  Now, the PASTA was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!  I got takeout so I didn't see until I got home...but when I opened up the box of pasta, it looked like there was no sauce on it. It looked like plain pasta as I could barely see the sauce.  Once I tried it, I could not taste the sauce. Instead I tasted OIL! I flip my pasta to mix it in and realized there was LOTS OF OIL in the bottom of the takeout box.   This is when I got really confused, I was wondering how can pasta be this bad.  To sum it up : the pasta dish was tasteless and drenched in massive amount of oil. I threw it out because there is no point in eating bland pasta that is covered in oil.  Maybe it was the cook who is inexperienced. I may try the pasta again in the future (just not anytime soon), and hopefully the people cooking will improve   SERVICE: 4/5 , they seemed a bit unorganized. But hopefully that will improve. Overall they were friendly"}
{"text":"Italian names are all over the place and that is all that there is Italian... Setup is nice for a cafeteria lunch style place. Salads are ok but nothing special. Pizzas are absolutely tasteless but the crust is good. Service is very sketchy... If I were a poor student or a guy with no taste buds this would be a perfect place to call \"amazing\", but since I am neither and have been to many excellent Italian restaurants and cafés in Toronto and in Italy, I would stay as far from this place as possible."}
{"text":"Wow, that was a surprise.  My wife and I stopped here for a mid afternoon snack.  Our expectations were not high, being that we were in Italy in the spring.    The appearance of the restaurant was quite positive and the staff were very nice and helpful.  We ordered a caprese salad and the Polette side to share.    Here's where the Wow really came in!  The meatballs were fantastic.  Perfectly cooked and super tasty.  The sauce with them was a perfect accompaniment.  The Caprese was also awesome.  First of all it looked great.  It was obvious time was taken to prepare this salad.  More on the plus side was the fact the salad had plenty of tomato, cheese and basil and it was all fresh and delicious. Their balsamic dressing was 'lick the bowl' good!  Thank you Cibo for a wonderful afternoon dining experience!  Can't wait to try your Lasagna Bolognese."}
{"text":"Went with friends to Via Cibo on a Monday night. It was surprisingly busy for a weeknight, but we hit a sweet spot and were able to get a table for four before the rush really started.  Via Cibo takes your food order and you pay at the counter, and then you pay for drinks and desserts at a second counter. They serve wine and beer, and have a gelato counter. Ordering at the counter is efficient, but I hate trying to decide on a menu item from a wall.  I ate a kale salad with steak. My friends ordered pasta, and my husband had pizza. The kale salad was huge portion and I had to get some of it to go. The salad was ok, could have used a bit more flavour/dressing, but the steak was weird. The meat was in super-long flat strips that were difficult to eat and the texture was unpleasantly stiff and unnatural. My husband did not enjoy his pizza. The crust was too hard and chewy. He tried to cut into it and the pizza almost slid across the table. Our friends said they thought the pasta was good.Both couples shared gelatos. The gelato is ok.   The atmosphere is super casual, with a variety of seating choices. It's loud because of the ordering counter and open food prep area. I would prefer take-out to eating in.  The service is fast, and we were asked many times how everything was. For young people, they did an ok job of taking care of guests.   Overall, I was a bit disappointed because I long to find a place that duplicates the excellent pizza, gelato and food in Italy, but maybe that's asking a bit too much. I don't know that I would go back, unless I was looking for an alternative to the usual fast food options in the neighbourhood.  If you're not too picky this might be a great place for families looking for a quick and easy meal with value. The ingredients are a step-up from fast food, and it's not over-priced.  Atmosphere 4/10 Food 5/10 Service 6/10"}
{"text":"The decor was beautiful. I would have liked the music louder to get more of an Italian street feel but nice feel. Entering is a little confusing but I am sure when becoming a regular this will not be a challenge. The food was excellent! Will be back with friends. Great concept."}
{"text":"Went out with a friend for my birthday lunch. We were a bit awestruck when we first walked in to a really busy, noisy lunch scene. We saved two spots at the long table then joined the line to order. The line moved in not time at all and we had just sat down and made ourselves comfortable when our coffees appeared. I ordered the large macchiato because I needed a good caffeine fix and I wasn't disappointed. The espresso was had a great flavour but there was a bit too much milk in the macchiato for me. I would ask for 'just a splash' next time I visit. After a bit of conversation our food arrived and it was so good I was halfway done when I realized that I was eating a different sandwich than I ordered! It seemed there was a bit of a mix up and I ended up with the chicken sandwich instead of the portobello and goat cheese sandwich. I wasn't too concerned but we did tell the server. To my surprise, the kitchen made me a portobello and goat cheese sandwich to take home.  We also had the really yummy Parmesan fries and they were out of this world! I would definitely come here again because the food was very fresh tasting and well put together...some people may not like the service style but for me it is similar to the service we received in Australia and other countries. Something new for Calgary I guess. If you are having an intimate lunch or dinner, or a business meeting I would not recommend Via Cibo. It's pretty loud and can get crowded. I kind of felt like the people next to us were listening to our conversations. But if you want a fun hang out spot with great food, give Via Cibo a try."}
{"text":"UPDATED: I wanted to updated my original review below as Razo followed up with me personally about my review, and also gifted me a very generous gift card as a result of my experience. This was a very unexpected yet pleasant surprise and shows how much management cares about customer feedback and how to effectively remediate issues. Thank you, Razo, and we will definitely be back for another visit soon!  I was excited to hear a Via Cibo was opening close to my house as we usually go to the one in Deerfoot Meadows. We went for dinner tonight with our toddler and 4 month old baby. The hostess who greeted us was very friendly and after giving us the menus, told us she would be back shortly to go over the menus. As such, I assumed she would be taking our order at the table and not at the till. We waited for 15-20 minutes before she came back. When I told her what we wanted to order, she told us that they were out of pomodoro sauce, which pretty much eliminated half the items on the menu - and all of the meals we wanted to order. We then spent another 10 minutes trying to find other food to accommodate this and the staff at the till was not helpful at all. By this time, my baby was crying and my toddler was cranky because he was very hungry. I was so frustrated that we ended up getting our meals to go. The meals we did order were fine but the staff should have let us know right off the bat that the restaurant was out of a key ingredient, instead of having us wait 15-20 minutes after we were seated to find out. This would have been more tolerable if it was just my husband and me, but given that we had 2 young kids with us, that should have been taken into consideration (especially for a restaurant that markets itself as family friendly). Also, for an Italian restaurant to be out of pomodoro sauce on a Friday night at 5pm - with no explanation as to why from the staff - is probably not a great sign for a new opening."}
{"text":"Started going to this place since it started, as its walking distance from my house. They have amazing authentic dishes for reasonable prices. The staff are always welcoming and friendly. The pizzas are really good, but I prefer greasier pizzas. The pastas and sandwiches are definitely their specialty. The atmosphere is awesome too - very cozy, and it is a perfect mix of restaurant and fast food which makes it perfect for lunch, and get together at night. Plus they have beer and wine! And the desserts, if you have any room left, are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Eek. Worst restaurant experience in Calgary (and we have eaten out regularly since my husband was a professional cook).  My eggs were not cooked & my husband's \"French Toast\" was so runny he needed a spoon to eat it.  Took my tot here for her first birthday breakfast, what a mistake! Since our food was barely edible for us, we asked if we could order a scrambled egg for her.  Not only did it take 15 minutes to get an answer, I was told I would have to order an entire dish! (I was willing to pay for that scrambled egg and said so).  The place was not busy but everyone had to check with someone else because cooking up  a scrambled egg or two seemed to be a big request at a place where many families dined.  I emailed the restaurant shortly after the event (like to give them a chance to fix it before I post a review) but was told I had emailed the downtown location. They did not even bother to give me the correct email address.  I have gained understanding and empathy for restaurants due to my husband's career in the biz, but this is inexcusable! Horrible! Horrible! Horrible!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place! A step above all the other options in the area. Quality food at a decent (for calgary) price.  Yes it was a bit chaotic during the opening week but it seems they have things sorted. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"PROS: kid friendly, convenient location, friendly staff, FRENCH TOAST, COFFEE CONS: bad service/poor training, mediocre food, frozen ingredients, uncomfortable seating when busy, odd ordering system We went here for lunch on mother's day and I really wanted to like it, but it was just sub-par. The ordering system is rather odd (you order at the front, pay for your meal, then sit down... and then they bring it to you?) and inconvenient. Their staff were pretty pleasant but also undertrained.  After we ordered our food, we were served our coffee immediately... and then made to wait 25 minutes for the rest of our food. While we're waiting, the rest of the restaurant clears out, so there are very few orders being placed. When our food came, 3/4 dishes arrived. One person was just made to wait for their meal, which was very odd. We looked over to the kitchen after about 5 minutes of waiting on the last dish and the waiters were sitting and talking!  After my friend waved them down the dish finally came. We ordered a salad with chicken, two Italian eggs Benedict, and a tiramisu french toast. The french toast was AWESOME! Very sweet but that's to be expected. It was served on a giant piece of bread with delicious filling... yuuummmm!! As for the eggs Benedict, mostly mediocre. Their eggs were good but their hollandaise sauce was sub-par. Their salad was awful. Soggy lettuce, boring flavors. Plus their chicken was pre-frozen. Overall, that meal was 85$.  Maybe their pasta and pizza are better, but I came in with much higher expectations. I hope they can do better. If you want a good Italian brunch/lunch with fresh ingredients and good service, maybe look elsewhere."}
{"text":"A friend and I went in Sunday night. We each ordered a pasta dish one with sausage the other with veal, you could fit the entire contents of meat into a tablespoon. I'm sorry when you pay 14 bucks for an entrée it better have more meat than that. Seems to be coming the norm for a lot of Calgary  chain restaurants. One more thing, where's the bread what Italian meal is served without it."}
{"text":"If youve got a crave for Italian food. This is the best Service . It's fast plus it's tasty. You wont get disappointed"}
{"text":"Food was OK, service verging on non-existent.  Staff don't seem to be trained at all in regards to any customer service.  They don't seem to be at all interested in their customers."}

{"text":"I love this place. Food is great.  Price is right.  The mini donuts are addictive.  The pastas are fresh and so tasty.  Family friendly.  Nice patio.  Don't be fooled by other reviews.  Just note: you need to order your food at the counter, then the friendly staff will deliver it to your table.  If you sit at a table without ordering, you won't get food!"}
{"text":"I noticed this restaurant a few days ago, decided to go there with all my family. It was a very good experience, delicious food and good quality. Pizza, pollo balsamic and pollo parmigiana so delicious. Price very reasonable. I fully recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"A three letter word comes to mind... YUM The prosciutto piadina was awesome because I'm in love with the fig infused balsamic reduction that they put on it, the one downfall was that the prosciutto was cut too thick and it became unpleasant when I couldn't just take a bit with struggling with it. The fresh pasta hasn't failed me yet. The chianti that they serve is one of my favs.  As for the flow of the place, the menu that takes up the top of a main wall hurts my neck, I always go straight for the ordering station and grab a menu. The other thing that they didn't quite think of was the patio. So when you order and want to sit outside you either have to go all the way to the end to pay, then go all the way back the way you came onto on coming traffic or you can exit the restaurant and walk around the gated patio to find the latch to the outside gate."}
{"text":"Pretty good food, poor unattentive service. Men's room was completely out of TP and my friend noticed mid-poop. I informed the staff and it took them 10 minutes to get him some. Lots of potential, though."}
{"text":"Only earned 3-stars but wanted to give it more.  I heard great things about Cibo and watched Via Cibo get developed every time I went to get my skate sharpened at the nearby Hockey Experts.    My wife and I were hungry so I was pumped to give it a try.....high quality, authentic Italian fast food....I mean fuck yeah...basically the best idea on stoner planet.    So we go in and I order a Carbonara with chicken and my wife orders the Calabrese sandwich.  Mine was pretty decent considering how fast it came out (but nothing memorable) but my wife's sani was disgusting.  It was literally ice cold slop (mozza, tomato sauce, basil all mixed together...no meat) It was weird because the bun was toasted and warm but the slop was ice cold and tasted like when you mix salsa and sour cream together.  I know that Calabrese salad is meatless but this sandwich definitely lacked something substantial.    Don't get me wrong... I live near this place and will definitely give it a second and third chance because I like the idea of fast Italian food, but if they fuck up an easy sandwich like that again then it might be tough to justify a return."}
{"text":"I read some bad reviews and came here to eat anyways!!! Glad I did!! It's fast and delicious for the price!! The portion size is huge for the price!! I would recommend this for anyone wanting a quick and good fast Italian meal!! It's not traditional fine dining but it's great for a quick fix!!!"}
{"text":"I had Chicken & Portobello and probably the worst chicken ever. The pasta with chicken was below average. This was our second time at Via Cibo in 3 years and never coming back again."}
{"text":"Steady slide from great to mediocre.  My food was cold and it came from a return trip to the kitchen, marginally warmer.  Front of house staff were gracious and refunded the entree.  He also offered a free dessert. Might be awhile before we try them again, if ever.  Too bad, works great on our way to Costco!!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that this place doesn't have more 5 stars. I think this place is awesome! I  it's authentic and the decor is a cross between romantic eat-in and retro fast food...With an Italian twist..If that makes sense?  In terms of cleanliness, on par. The washrooms are always clean and that's how I rate a restaurants overall cleanliness. The the tables are cleaned and always have utensil bundles (do they have an actual name for those?).   I feel that I need to mention the fact that their napkins are super high quality and can compete with bounty extra ply paper napkins and win easily.   Their service has been quick all 3 times I've been. Somewhere between 5-10 minutes which is great. Consistency in service and food quality is key to a successful business.  Finally, the best for last...that portobello and goat cheese piadina is to DIE FOR!!!! Their Tuscan fries are also delicious...but that piadina oh man!  I come here just for that. (I cannot comment on their pizzas because I've never had them)  It loses 1 star for 2 reasons, they are slightly overpriced (11 for a piadina) but I am willing to overlook it and pay for delicious quality food. Next, the wrap wasn't warm to my liking, there was inconsistency in that. Otherwise definitely come try the piadina."}
{"text":"Via Cibo is one of my favourite spots in Toronto. Since discovering it earlier this year, I have probably been here at least half a dozen times for brunch, lunch, and dinner. Service is fantastic, and the food is consistently good (and reasonably priced).  One thing I love about this place is the portion size. I go home happy and full. Also, I cannot make an order without having a side of Tuscan fries. The fries alone are perfection, but the truffle oil, rosemary and grana padano elevate this concoction to godly levels. I love them so much that for the longest time I would not forgo them to try the via poutine. One day we just ordered both, and I am glad we did. The ragu surprisingly went really well with the fries!  My favourite dishes are probably the steak panino and steak salad, but that might be because I like steak. The piadinas are really good, albeit a bit messy to eat. Of the pastas, I've only tried the broccolini and sausage, and did find it a bit underwhelming. For brunch, I had the blueberry lemon ricotta pancakes and was very pleased with it although it was a bit sweet for my taste. As for drinks, you can't go wrong with an Italian soda or any espresso-based drink.  Come here for a casual date, lunch with the kids or by simply by yourself. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"I arrived with my wife not knowing what to expect. They have this cool draft pouring device which actually pours pop(too bad it's Pepsi...Pepsi is disgusting) We went up and ordered good and after a bit of a wait (20 mins) they brought it out. There weren't many people there when we were there so the wait was disappointing. The food was meh! I got a chicken wrap with onions, tomatoes and goat cheese. The bread wasn't great and the flavors weren't to my liking. My wife had pasta which tasted ok. Atmosphere was neat. I prefer Denny's"}
{"text":"Most super delicious food. Most super efficient ordering concept. My stomach is the most full.  Everything is excellent. YEA!!!!"}
{"text":"This review covers side dishes so I'll revise if needed when I go back and sample the dinner portions.  I dropped in here with medium hopes as I work close by, and normally frequent the other establishments that I'm happy with.   Off the bat I was blown away by the combination of taste, portion and price. I went with a benchmark dish I like to use as a comparison dish: Caesar salad (Cesar) @ $7.00. I threw in the Tuscan fries @ $4.00 as a hot side to go with it. The Caesar was easily the best I've had, just enough dressing to wet the leaves but no clumps, just enough cheese and garnish (bacon) to dress the dish up. The balance of tangy and savoury was excellent. The fries were more of the same. Gently seasoned with cheese shavings on top. They were crisp and delicious.  The portions were very reasonable, not too large, and not too small.   They are clearly working out the front counter logistics and I expect that will get better, but with food this tasty I'm making this a 5 out of 5. The owner/franchisees were discreetly making the rounds, watching over the break-in phase. The staff appear motivated and happy, which makes for a great cafe experience.  I'll be adding this to my three restaurant list of always-go-to places for lunch and sneak-out dinners.   Waiter-service: while you pay at the end of the counter cafeteria style, they give you numbers to take to your seat. What they can't give you then they bring to you.  Great people, great food, great prices."}
{"text":"Slowly but surely, quality restaurants are making their way up to the 'burbs. I've been to Via for dinner (when they first opened) and brunch (when my patience ran thin elsewhere) and both times were splendid!  Everything is made to order, and you pay upfront before you settle into a table with your number place card.  Thin crust prosciutto and arugula pizza? Delish! Although I wish they sliced the pizza better (thin crust cut into 4 large slices leads to a floppy mess). Currently I'm obsessed with Carbonara, and the one we had here continued to fuel my fire. Pancetta and cheese are a match made in pasta heaven.  Want to titillate your tastebuds? Try their french toast infused with nutella and banana! It'll definitely satisfy your sweet tooth too!"}
{"text":"I love the carbonara! The service is also good good good! We often go their for lunch, and all loved it!"}
{"text":"I feel this place needs some serious managing lets start with the disgusting dirty men's room nothing like fresh urine on the toilet seat and the complete lack of supplies. The lack of cleanliness follows to the seating area it was not very busy but none of the tables had been cleaned er I mean cleared the table washing takes on a whole new meaning of disgust I do not like my table to be wiped with a reisty rag after wiping shart laden seats yea the meal arrives Caesar salad child's portion but who cares who wants wilted old salad other dish had a complete lack of Alfredo sauce on the cold pasta and onto the char broiled chicken ptarmigan well done on the charring enter the pimple laden manager appointee who was not told not to argue with the customer and defend the poor quality of food with a I'm sure it was done right if you want an episode of disgust hurry to Via Cibo and I hope you are not disapointed if the place is clean and food resembles something edible"}
{"text":"Went to Via Cibo to celebrate a coworker's birthday today. It was chilly today and surprisingly Cibo was moderately busy at around 11:45am. We ordered a bunch of item to share between 5 people. Ordered two pizza (Pepperoni and Prosciutto E Arugula), one pasta (Sausage & Broccolini), one salad (Tuscan Kale), and two appetizers (Tuscan Fries & Bruschetta).   Overall, meal was very satisfying. The pizza crust was okay, the center got soggy but it was thin with some good flavour. Pepperoni was spicy, and there was a lot of Prosciutto! Pasta was very delicious and the sauce was spicy but i really enjoyed it. The kale salad was flavourful and refreshing, with the crunch of some peanuts it was perfect. Tuscan Fries was a good starter and has a very good sauce. The bruschetta was alright we could have went without it.  Do recommend Cibo. I wish we got some desserts but had to rush back to work."}
{"text":"Not to be confused with Cibo downtown (a full-service restaurant with the same owners as Bonterra), Via Cibo is the first Calgary location of an Alberta-and-Ontario franchise focusing on \"Italian Streetfood\". For me, it's a local quick lunch option that isn't fast food, grocery store sushi and Vietnamese!  I had been to this location once before to pick up a dinner for my boyfriend (a steak panini and caesar salad which he SWEARS by) since they are open until 10 - much later than other higher-scale to go restaurants like Mucho Burrito. During that visit the service was somewhat slow, but in the staff's defense, we came waltzing in a half hour before they closed so I'm sure they had some elements of the kitchen already broken down to clean and we were prepared that it may take a bit longer.  Today, I stopped in to grab lunch to-go after a barre class (a proscuitto piadina and a cavola salad) and my experience was lovely. I walked in, ordered, was given a sample of gelato and had just enough time to send a quick email when my order came out. I was somewhat surprised by the piadina, but that was my own fault for not looking at the menu images or doing any research. A Piadina is almost like an Italian wrap, though it is wide wrapped to look more like a crepe... and it is sooooo good. I love the proscuitto/argula combo, though, so I may be biased. The cavola salad is kale based and does not come dressed when you order to to go, which leads to a bit of a dry salad, but I appreciated being able to dress it to my taste. I'll probably try one of the other salads next time, though.  Janna L. describes the ordering and food recieving process well, so make sure to give her review a read before you hit the restaurant... or else, just don't be afraid to ask questions when you get there. There is no table service, so it's a little different than most restaurants.  I'll definitely be back when I need a quick meal and I can't wait to try the traditional pizzas!"}
{"text":"Been a little curious about this place for a while and after today's visit, I truly hope that they break whatever bad karma this particular spot has as all the previous restaurants didn't last very long.  Place was a little like a cafeteria like setting however your order is brought to you.  So basically you walk in, read the menu, drool, place your order then walk down to the cashier with the number for your table.  Waiting time didn't seem long either but we were also the only other small group there.  I can only imagine how it is during its peak time.    [Sides] Tuscan Fries - Only other place where I've tried fries cooked in truffle oil was at Four Seasons Hotel New York and those are still one of the best fries I've ever had.  Definitely will be one and last things I'll have when I go back there.    The potato selection itself could've been better, in my opinion.  This was a little on the starchier side so it was pretty dry.  Ever have frozen Mccain fries? Well, it's kind of like that but a little better of course.  Was perfectly seasoned with sea salt, fresh rosemary and had shavings of grana padano cheese which was very sharp.  Went very well with their, what I'm guessing was a type of aioli. This would go very well with a sandwich or if you're feeling peckish. 4.5/5.   Polpette - This was quite perfection.  The meat was lean but had enough of its natural fat to keep it very moist and juicy.  Was perfectly cooked and the sauce was great! Would've been great if you go at least some garlic bread to go with it as it was just served on its own.  But then that may also be a good thing as you get to really just indulge in all its flavour. 5/5.   [Main] Pollo Balsamico - A very generous serving of piadina (flat bread) with grilled chicken cooked in a balsamic reduction and was garnished with baby spinach, caramelized onions, goat cheese, sundries tomatoes.  Seemed like the chicken was slowly grilled or was at least marinating in the balsamic because just one bite had a burst of flavour.  Would definitely get this one again. 5/5.  Prosciutto E Arugula Pizza - Usually when you go to new restaurants, it takes you a while to select something from the menu.  But as soon as I saw this on the menu, I just HAD to get it and I must say that I was very pleased with my selection.  The crust itself I would've preferred to be on the crispier side rather than the doughy side.  Regardless, it was still nice.  I basically ended up dipping the (doughy) crust in what was left from the polpette's sauce.    If God were Italian, I think the prosciutto would've been personally cured and dried by His own hands. In other words, the prosciutto was dabomb.com.  The slices weren't overly thin and it seemed far from what you would normally have on any or all other proscuitto pizzas.  I wouldn't be surprised if the ham itself was imported directly from Italy.  What I also loved about the pizza was that they were very generous with the arugula.  So for $15, you got more than your money's worth.  The serving was huge and again, very generous with the toppings.  The balsamic drizzle was also a nice touch.  I definitely would go back for this again. 5/5.   Via Casalinga - If you like Sicilian type pizza then you definitely need to try this.  The salami wasn't overly salty and you get a generous amount of it.  The ricotta cheese was also very nice and creamy.  Definitely the toppings (also had sausage) complimented each other.  Because I was expecting it to be on the spicier side, I personally would've loved some hot pepper flakes on it, however it was still great the way it was.  Another item I'd get again. 5/5.  [Dessert] Not exactly sure what it was called but for dessert we had some type of rolled up baked dough stuffed with Nutella and served with caramel gelato.  Because it was baked, it was nice and warm and gooey.  Definitely on the richer side but c'mon, it's Nutella.  You can't exactly go wrong either.  5/5."}
{"text":"This recently opened fast casual eatery offers Italian style  pizza, flatbreads, pasta, salads and gelato in the south side development   The decor is airy and stunning: for a quickservice resto:  soaring high ceilings with industrial loft ambiance, very current.  Leave that aside, it is an overpriced fast food offering sit down restaurant prices   We ordered the carbonara pasta ($10) which had a smallish decent portion served on a ceramic plate with a 2\" slice of crusty bread. You would look deep into the late to find the hint of small tidbits of bacon and sauce ingredients.  You have to add $5 or $6 if you want any small size protein like chicken or chorizo.  A bit of a ripoff.   The steak Italian was actually a good sandwich; at $14 it was overpriced even if it came with the a small and very tiny portion of salad.  The steak was good, small thin shavings of real grilled similar to the ones found in Vietnamese subs, except at like three to four times the price again this was tasty but not $14 tasty, worth about $9-10 at most...  The beverages are overpriced too $3 for pop from a broken draft style dispenser in the dining room, meh #ripoff  So way way way waaaaaay overpriced for what you get, decent food you can get elsewhere, the high ceilings and loft ambiance alone don't justify the high prices, the menu, overall experience and ingredients need to match to the high menu price, next! #GoodDecor #SkimpyPortions #RipOff #WayWayoverpriced"}
{"text":"I was recommended to this place by a work collegue who said it was amazing and she was right!! My boyfriend and I went for lunch today and it was beyond delicious!!! He had a pasta dish and I had a piadina. The pasta was well cooked and a good sized portion; not overdosed in sauce. My boyfriend was full before he could finish and he can eat. My piadina was HUGE and to die for. The chicken was cooked perfectly and I got a taste of everything in each bite. I am definitely going to recommend this to my gal pals and family. What a gem that stands out in a sea of chain restaurants in Deerfoot Meadows. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I arrived 1.5 hours before their stated closing time of 10pm. Upon arriving - I was greeted right away by a friendly gentleman who took my order. When paying I Felt rushed by the girl working for whatever reason who wasn't really friendly. She seemed in a rush to close.   Once the food arrived it was luke warm. Nobody showed up for a quality check. The meatballs  l heard so much about were luke warm and dry.   For the price this is weak. Totally overpriced. Dry meatballs, grumpy front end staff but the Caesar salad and coffee were yummy! Very disappointed I don't think I will return.   It's sad when staff cares more about closing duties instead of the customer.  Labour costs shouldn't be a concern with 25 dollars for pasta, meatballs and a salad.    My expectations were not met."}
{"text":"A newly open Via Cibo: an open Italian kitchen restaurant; it looks bright and very modern design.  Services was good, due to we are the last customer at the restaurant... oops.... so anyways the staff was friendly and keep checking on us. I order a Prosciutto Arugula Pizza: Prosciutto, Arugula, Fior Di Latte Mozzarella, Slow Roasted Tomatoes, Shaved Grana Padano Cheese, Drizzle of Fig Infused Balsamic Reduction, Tuscan Fries (was recommend by other yelpers): Truffle Oil, Rosemary, Sea Salt, Shaved Grana Padano Cheese. And Italian Soda drink (you can choose a flavour of: Black Cherry, Lemonade, Grapefruit, Pomegranate, and Blood Orange).  Food quality was fresh hand made by scratch including the pizza dough and good appetizer portion size (If you are looking for heavy portion main course, it's not good idea.). Minus one star for their menu items improvement: for the pizza it tasted over acidic due to tomatoes and balsamic reduction. And the Italian soda was good and flavourful, but hopefully they can add a cream on it, as create another variety of Italian Cream Soda. I'll definitely visit again to try their pasta and sandwiches, but hopefully they will increase or modify their menu item."}
{"text":"Update: after vowing not to go back to Via Cibo, our friends wanted to meet us there just a couple of days after our initial visit. I told the manager what happened earlier in the week, and she was very apologetic and reduced the price of our meal. This time, all of the food was very good, as was the service. I still think it's a bit pricey, but Via Cibo is no longer on my boycott list :-)  3.5 stars (due to the price)  We decided to check out Via Cibo for the first time for lunch today. After getting over the initial shock of the cost of lunch ($40 for two sandwiches and two sides and a $4 can of San Pellegrino), we took our first few bites of our meal. We immediately noticed that the salad served with the sandwiches was well past it's prime. After bringing this to the attention of a staff member, he said \"oh sorry about that\" and that was the end of it. Then I bit into my sandwich, and to my dismay, the tomato on the sandwich was completely rotten. The rest of the food was quite good - maybe they were just having a really off day. In any case, we won't be back. 1 star."}
{"text":"It is located close to my home. So I have been here a few times. As other's have mentioned as you enter there is the menu on the wall; you order the food; pay the bill get the number and the food will be delivered to your seat. Quite efficient system - no need of menus on the tables, no wasted time - your's or server's.  The food is okay. I love their Tuscan fries. They are french fries drizzled with some truffle oil; sprinkled with rosemary and shaved grana padano. Pizza is flavourful too. The pastas are okay. The prices are not too expensive as well. They have weekly specials - Tuesdays they have pasta for 8$, four selections to choose from. Wednesdays they have Margherita/Pepperoni pizza for 8$.   Try when you're in the area. Tuscan fries are a must."}
{"text":"This has become my go to place for delicious Italian food. Would recommend their freshly made pizzas and flat breads. They also introduced brunch menu on sat and Sun. I had their tiramisu French toast which was sooooo good."}
{"text":"I was here over the weekend, just before noon. There was a slow steady stream of people coming in for lunch. It was my first visit here, and wasn't  sure what the ordering process was. You get in front of this big menu board, with different sandwiches, pasta's, and salads to choose from. To me it was a little overwhelming as to what to order. I just saw the first thing that caught my attention and ordered it, as to not hold the line behind me. I ordered the Pomodoro from the pasta section of the menu. My wife ordered a Insalata Pollo Balsamico. My two young boys ordered cheese pizza's. The person that takes your order, then hands you a table indentifier wand with a number on it (That's whatI call it). When the food ordering process is finished you head down the counter and order your drinks, and then pay for your order. After paying you find yourself a table to sit at and wait for the food to come to you. It didn't take that long for our order to come out, I'll say between 10-20 min. As for pasta dish, it came out quite hot (the noodles anyways), as for the meatballs that came with it they were siding on the cold side of luke warm. I liked the taste non the less. My wife enjoyed her salad, and what can I say about the boys pizzas. My boys are happy eating frozen pizza out of a box. Not saying that the pizza's were bad, I asked them and they both said they liked it. I also noticed a sign of the wall, stating that everything was made from scratch. This may be so, but not from scratch that day. The meatballs were obviously made ahead of time, due to them being colder then the pasta itself. I have tasted \"just made\" meatballs for example at Double Zero.(Awesome one's) My only complaint about Via Cibo are the prices for this \"Italian street food\".  My pasta dish was $9.00, and add $4.00 for 4 meatballs.  $13.00 for basically eating spaghetti and meatballs is IMO a little high. This isn't  a bad place for let's say a date or if you eat alone, but if you eat out as a family  $65.00 for lunch is a little steep. I'm the only one who ordered a pop to drink the rest of the family had water with their lunch. Pop and canned juice are $3.00 each. It can quickly add to the bill if you drink pop, juice or alcohol.  In conclusion, I will probably not come back to Via Cibo just on the shear cost of everything on the menu. I am glad we tried it though. Everything taste wise was good, just have to be more conscientious when eating with the family."}
{"text":"It was okay! The portion are big (I didn't finish my plate) and the price is regular for an italian restaurant. I loved the italian soda."}
{"text":"Ambiance was fresh and fun. Basically a fancy way of saying it looks cool. I love the no waiter concept. The food was really good. My wife and I shared out plates. I had the penne pesto pasta. Probably the best tasting pasta I've ever had. Will come again."}
{"text":"It was great!  Perfect choice for our lunch this day. We were on our way to Extreme Pita (is it still there?) when we came across Via Cibo. They have a lunch special - $13 for a pasta, salad, and a drink. I like the walk up and order then a staff member serves your table concept - a lot of restaurants are doing this these days it seems. The food was great. My penne was cooked perfectly. The decor was nice and modern. Only one small flaw - the choice of music was like what you'd hear in a bathhouse."}
{"text":"Love the concept  - self-ordering cafeteria style but full-service quality. Toronto lacks what's big in California/West Coast - good, healthy, high-quality fare in-between fine-dining and fast-food. We need more Via Cibos. I always want to try something beyond the osso buco ragu pasta but it's so good, I almost never can. Pizza and sides like broccolini and meatballs I have tried - very solid. Very reasonable prices for the quality too. Coffee is great!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The concept of the restaurant is pretty unique. You order and pay first and then you go sit down and wait for your food to come.  My party ordered the lemon italian soda, tuscan fries, piccante pizza and carbonara with linguine noodles.  The good: The tuscan fries were really delicious. The fries came out hot and fresh and it blends really well with the shaved grana padano cheese. This is definitely a must try when you come here. The carbonara was very good as well. The noodles were al dente and it wasn't as saucy which I liked.   The bad: The crostino that came with the pasta was very bland and very hard. The biggest disappointment was the piccante pizza. The dough was soggy when it arrived and it really destroys the texture of the pizza. You would think the dough would be crispy since it comes out of a wooden oven but it was an utter disaster. Definitely avoid having pizza here.   Avoid eating the pizza and get pasta and definitely the tuscan fries!"}
{"text":"Great food. Their Eggs Benedicts at the weekend are delicious. Today I had the Italian Benedict on Focaccia Bread. Love the potatoes too. Price is very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"The consistency of food quality and taste has really gone down. The same dish tastes different every time you order it--sometimes delicious, sometimes mediocre, sometimes terrible! Particularly the pesto linguini, as that is the dish I always order. Such a shame! I used to eat here once a week, but the last time I ordered that dish it tasted so terrible that I probably won't go back there."}
{"text":"I got the rose pasta that was $11 plus shrimp $6. Really liked the sauce it wasn't heavy and had light flavour to it. I was glad I chose linguine over penne it was to my liking since the linguine wasn't thick it was thin. Overall it was good experience!"}
{"text":"Had the Lasagna Bolognese - Layered with Bolognese Sauce, Béchamel, Grana Padano, Pomodoro and Basil  I was not impressed, and was actually disappointed considering the 4-star rating. The lasagna was very soft and the sauce was irremarkable.  Considering the price, this is definitely a no-go-no-return on my list."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for their Sunday night dinner. Upon entering we were informed that their system was down, that someone was working on it, and they expected the system to be up and running in about 15 to 20 minutes time. We were also told that if we waited where we were someone would come and let us know when we could approach the cash area to put in our order. After waiting about 20 minutes I noticed one of the employees put in an order for a phone order. I asked the employee working the pass if the systems were up and if we would be able to place our order now and he said we could. Thanks for letting us know. Not a great first impression.   We ordered the Sunday night dinner which includes 2 pastas, 1 pizza, a Caesar salad, and bombolini covered in Nutella. All of this for only $39 which is a great deal. We ordered the gnocchi, rose pasta, prosciutto e arugula pizza and added the gorgonzola pear walnut pizza. The food was very good considering it is considered fast food. The Caesar salad was excellent. Great flavour and just enough dressing. The gnocchi came in a cream sauce. The sauce was good but the gnocchi was a bit over cooked. The rose pasta was excellent - the pasta was el dente and the sauce was delicious. The prosciutto pizza was good. It has a balsamic reduction drizzled on top. The gorgonzola pear walnut pizza was good - sweet and savoury. Sweetness from the pear and honey and savoury from the gorgonzola. Both pizzas were a bit soggy.  The bombolini was yummy - donut-like circles covered in sugar with Nutella. Great dessert to end the dinner.   At the end of the dinner we had some pizza left over so we asked the server who was clearing our plates for a pizza box. We waited for about 5 minutes and no one came by. We noticed that the staff was standing around in a group and chatting so I figured they had forgotten my request. We went up to the counter and asked for a pizza box.  I guess since this is a fast food place we should not expect exceptional customer service. That being said, there is still a level of customer service that is expected and Via Cibo fell short of that standard.  I will likely be ordering takeout from here if I want Italian and don't feel like driving too far but it will not be my first choice for food."}
{"text":"I really like the food, the speed of service,(except for the time that I watched our meal walk by and we had yet to get through the line to pay) and the layout.  We've eaten there many, many times and have always been satisfied or better.  my favorite is the prosciutto pizza.. Love it.  Bit salty, but it's not something I eat every day.  I love the new fast food; it's actually FOOD.  Good job!"}
{"text":"LOVE the dine in experience as it is the perfect blend between a fastfood and restaurant.  The decor is unique to me with some rare to find edison bulbs and a shiny pop machine that allows you to select your beverage.  The food is prepared for you as you can watch through the glass divider and the seperation of the beverage point of sale from the food point of sale is sheer genius.  The gelato I havent tried but it is on my to do list.  Food is delicious and flavourful, giving the customer some authentic italian choices and the italian soda stands head and shoulders above the competitors.  No free refills :(  Food is a bit pricy but what were you expecting?  This aint your mom and pop pizza shop!"}
{"text":"Top-notch restaurant quality food but with a casual feel. Very good value if you don't feel like paying fancy restaurant prices. The pizzas here are fantastic (better than most fancy restaurants) and so is the Osso Buco sandwich. You order at the cashier and they bring the food to your table or you can get it to go."}
{"text":"First time at Via Cibo. We had the Linguini Carbonara,  Broccolini and Sausage Penne, and Caesar Salad. Quality was good; portions were okay. At $20 pet person for fast food Italian, I'd say it's a bit pricey for what we got. That said, the flavours were better than fast food Italian. So, we wouldn't go out of our way to come here again, but might stop by if we were shopping in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place isn't quite a fast food restaurant and not exactly a sit down pne either, it's a concept that is righ in the middle - AND it works!  I've now been here 6 times and I've ordered all the flatbread sandwiches, the Ossobuco pasta, picante pizza, arugula salad and Cavolo salad.  I loved it all, the food here is simple, fast and good.  The staff are very nice and accomodating.  I would say if you're int he area and craving a burger, stop in here instead and try it."}
{"text":"I've been here when they first opened. Me and my friend ordered salads which at first we thought were pricey ($18). But when the food hit the table, it was super fresh and the grilled chicken was super tender. Different type of concept. Order in line, sit with your number and get semi-table service when your food is dropped off. I haven't been here since but I want to try their weekend brunch menu"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and I have enjoyed everything I have gotten so far. It's a definite go-to spot if I just want some cheap Italian food. It's not going to blow your mind, but for what you pay, it's pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a great little gem in the neighbourhood. We saw it while passing by and decided to give it a try - and I'm glad we did! The menu is simple, with a handful of items for each category which is good because customers don't like being overwhelmed with choices and the restaurants don't need to be a jack of all trades. We tried a couple of pastas, the steak Italiano  sandwich, the ceasar salad and sautéed greens. The broccolini and sausage pasta and the sautéed greens were tasty and had some kick to it with the chilli. The sandwich was good also. The prices were reasonable, just don't expect a full service restaurant. You have to order at the counter and they will bring you the food. I think this is a good concept and keeps the atmosphere casual."}
{"text":"This review is not about their food but about their customer service attitude.  Went in 20 minutes before their closing time and the feeling we got from everyone was unwelcoming. We asked for pasta - not available, then we asked for pizza - not enough dough left so it can't be made.   If you are closing your restaurant 20 minutes earlier then post that on door that no orders will be taken 20 minutes before the closing time rather than making excuses which do not make much sense."}
{"text":"Decent little spot. Went on a Sunday afternoon and it was DEAD. There was only 1 other person in there, although another group came in as we were leaving. The gal at the counter made them seem desperate for business. She stood and stared at us awkwardly for 5-10 minutes as were trying to decide what to order.   The food was ok. We ordered carbonara linguine, penne pomodoro, and a caesar salad. It literally came out less than 2 minutes after we ordered it....which seemed really weird. It's nice to get your food quickly, but this was McDonald's fast. And we were ready for a nice sit-down meal. When anything is served that quickly at a dine-in restaurant, it makes me very uncomfortable about the quality of the food.   People have complained that the portion sizes are small. I would say they're medium. We thought they were the perfect size - enough to fill you up, not stingy, but not enough to have leftovers. Just right, I'd say.  The penne pomodoro was excellent. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the flavor was amazing. The carbonara linguine was meh. Nothing special. The Caesar salad was YUM. We could've eaten a whole tub of it. The bread that they serve with the food is DISGUSTING. It's moist, mushy white bread that seems super processed and extremely cheap. It's not baguette quality with that thick crispiness on the outside and just a little softness on the inside. I feel like it came from Walmart.  The decor is great. It's got a nice vibe. I think it would make a cute evening date spot for some wine. The prices are also very reasonable. Would definitely go back. If they changed the bread, it would make a huge difference, I think."}
{"text":"This is a casual type of place where you can grab a group of friends to come and enjoy the delicious food offerings. Or, it can be just a quick, comfortable place for couples. We took our time in waiting for others to arrive, eating, chatting. There was no pressure to rush and later upon leaving, management made sure we had enjoyed our experience. We loved checking this new place out and now have the menu and ordering system down-pat! Walk in, head to the little red signs with numbers and stands on them, order the food, move on down to register 2 and order drinks and then pay for it all. Have a seat with your number on the table and I swear your food will come out piping hot in about 5 minutes. GREAT pizza oven, takes about 90 seconds to make the za in 600 degree heat. NOMS!  Our table of 6 ordered 3 different salads, poutine, rosemary fries, pasta carbonara, meatballs, 2 pizzas... all very good. No soggy pizza here despite the very thin crust. Staff was friendly. Does it remind me of Famoso? Yes, but that is NOT a bad thing. We found the food prices to be quite reasonable. (EX -= $11 for a nice sized 4 slice Margarita pizza, $5 for a side arugula salad with roasted veg.) The cashier told me that they just got their liquor license today so soon, you will be able to have a glass of wine with your dinner! We had an amazing time and will return when down south!"}
{"text":"Affordably priced mid-range fast food Italian food place that makes homemade pasta and pizzas. Quick fast food style order system (you order when you come into the restaurant, before you sit down) but they'll deliver your order to your table by locating your table with the order number indicator they give you. Spacious and comfortable aesthetic, felt like a diner in some ways but more upscale and vamped up. Came here recently for a friends birthday. Great for brunch!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Definitely enjoyed the overall vibe. I would have given it a better rating if the person taking my order was pleasant. She had a TERRIBLE attitude.  We ordered the Tuscan fries, the Caesar salad, the Rose linguine with shrimp, and the Pomodoro (noodles were overcooked and stuck together). Despite a few mishaps, the food and portions were good. Not sure if we will be going back."}
{"text":"Visited Fri Nov 25 for dinner (Party of 2) I called to make reservations, and they say they don't take reservations. Yet there are tables with Reserved signs on them when I arrive at 6pm.   Pros Side tus kale - Amazingly prepared, and tasty. Not sure if they massaged the leaves enough, that's the secret to bringing out the sweetness.  Pollo alla griglia - Very unique item that is like a quesadila. The chicken was seasoned well and paired well with the carbonerra (bacon). I have never seen this item before.  Pasta al ragu ossobuco - A bit over-priced at $15 but tasted fresh. Fast service, food arrived in 5 min.   Cons  The traffic on Leslie and York Mills is really busy on a Fri night, so plan extra travel time to get here. Parking lot was full when we arrived. The Asian server with glasses didn't smile and didn't seem very enthusiastic, smile and I would have given a tip :) Hard to understand the menu since everything is in Italian, it took 5 min of studying the ingredients to understand what was on the menu. What is a piadina? What is a panino? I have heard of a panini. High chairs a bit hard to sit in as the seat is so high.  Single washrooms only, you get that uncomfortable feeling when you're inside doing your business and people keep trying to get in because they can't tell if it's occupied or not.   Protip - Look through the menu in advance, as there is no server to answer question until you get to the cash. There was a lineup of people behind me as I asked questions.   Damage - $40"}
{"text":"Casual dining place for some good Italian food. The penne pasta with broccoli and sausages is really good. Awesome place to go!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was excellent.  Stopped in for lunch for chicken balsamic.  It was excellent and very large portion!"}
{"text":"I rate this chain operation at 3.75 and therefore a 4 (Yelp, can you please give us the splits for the fine distinctions that help reviewers and readers?) We've had the pasta at Via Cibo now about 7 times at this location, and each time the quality of the sauce, the noodles and the small heel of bread has been up there, with a pleasing aftertaste that lasts for a good spell... Most often I've ordered the Italian sausage and broccolini with extra garlic, and my wife will go with something like arrabiata and added shrimp, and we've always been satisfied.  These dishes is fine with just water, but a wee glass of red would likely set them off more pleasingly.  Some info... The good pasta noodles - penne and linguine - are Barilla, but that's not the secret of their smooth flavour in the noodles. For such good fast pasta, they pre-boil the noodles earlier in the shift, then briefly re-heat them in boiling water and toss into the wok after the stir-fried garlic, butter, oil, flavour veggies and meat is cooking. Doesn't take long but the noodles are definitely exceptional tasting. Another venue in BC also did the same on open-flamed high heat, and, although different, their dishes were equally very good.  Two reservations... 1.  the price has jumped from $12-13 to $15-16+ in just one year! In a tight economy one can justify it as an owner, but as a guest, no so good.  2.  one time my wife and I went to the ViaCibo in the Heritage valley area sandwiched by Deerfoot and Glenmore, but we were disappointed: for some reason, flavours and consistency were off.   So we continue to frequent the one on 14th Street at 15th Avenue. Oh yes, please don't confuse Cibo on 17th Avenue with ViaCibo? The former is not all that good at all.  Check it out?"}
{"text":"The Italian Benedict was amazing! The portion was a lottle bit small but it definitely worth the price!"}
{"text":"So the service and staff where TOP NOTCH, had a lot of fun and treated us real well. They get 5 stars But the food really let me down, my friend got a pizza and fries (I know weird right?) and she said they where both excellent. I got what was basically a meatball sub on thick bread, and I was not super impressed. Not enough cheese, it wasnt melted or hot enough, little thin on the sauce and the Italian soda sucked, but that is cause I am an idiot and didn't stir it til like the end, so it was just an ok Sannich. Id be willing to try them again and update this, but they are kind of expensive for what they are I feel, so it probably wont be soon"}
{"text":"I recently gave this place a try after seeing it in the Deerfoot Meadows complex.  I have to admit, I wasnt sure what to expect  thinking that perhaps would be an upscale Sbarro  ( remember the 80's?) - however I was in for a pleasant surprise.   The concept is simple- order at the counter and they will bring out your food when ready.  The food was definitely the star of the show - as a vegetarian, I ordered their basic pizza with basil, tomato sauce and cheese.  It was delicious - the tomato sauce had a lovely acidity balanced by a delicious crust  that to me had a touch of sweetness... yum. The large basil leaf on top of the pizza although lovely visually, wasnt necessarily easy to eat or incorporate into each bite - definitely no biggie though. Last but not least was the mozzarella - handmade, creamy delicious and fresh.    I had a side caesar salad to start which even as a side was plentiful - the croutons were noteworthy - crunchy and flavourful and the dressing once again tasted fresh and made with care.   After we sat down, I noticed they had a really cool draft type handle at a drink station that serves soft drinks - I wish I had known before I got my drink, I would have really liked to have used it! I am a big kid and somewhat addicted to Diet coke too.   The decor inside is very cool - clean lines, deep browns accented with white and red.  So here is where the restaurant earned top notches in my books... the service.  Everyone was genuinely friendly, and customer focused.  A gentleman ( manager I think) came around and asked us how are meal was and I said to him that we were loving the place, so surprised and  happy we were there.  The manager was so nice and said   \" Can we buy you each a dessert?\"  Wow! So nice... we each had a scoop of gelato which was equally delicious and satisfying...   The manager was Tabrez and was fantastic.    By the time we left it was packed - so you may want to grab lunch early say 1130. Cibo is a welcome addition to the Deerfoot meadows complex, and a much needed step up from the fast food fare around there.  Bueno."}
{"text":"Via Cibo refers to themselves as \"street food\" but it is more like a modern, airy bistro that serves trattoria style food in a cafeteria style setting.   They offer 5 main types of food categories: salads, flatbreads, sandwiches, pizza & pasta. My husband and I both went for a piadina (flatbread). Flatbread is completely misleading for what we received. The flatbread is nothing more than a tortilla and the way that the piadana is constructed makes it difficult to eat but the contents themselves are plentiful and very tasty. I had a pollo balsamico which was loaded with chicken, spinach, caramelized onion, sundried tomatoes and goat cheese. I was so full after eating it that it was my lunch and dinner.   My husband had a calabrese sausage piadina that was packed with an unbelievable amount of sausage. His only complaint was that the other contents were not evenly distributed so the pepper, onion, aoli and sauce just showed up in selected bites.   The flatbreads weren't inexpensive ($14 & $11 respectively)  but given the size of them and the amount of protein in them the prices were reasonable. We took advantage of a deal that they were running that offered a certificate for a pizza Margherita if you bought a $25 gift certificate so at some point we will be back."}
{"text":"The whole ordering process is very unique! I loved the feel of the place and how everything is set up!  The menu is pretty diverse (in terms of only Italian food! haha). You can order anything from Pasta, Pizza, Insalate and much more! I ended up ordering the Pasta Al Pesto! It was alright. The speed of it was good however, I found it super oily! Like my pasta was legit swimming in a big ol' pool of oil. So that kind of turned me off of it. Now I'm aware pesto has olive oil but like this was way over on the oil front. The flavour was good though! Would I order it again? Probably would try something else!   Verdict? I would try this place again for sure- just not that pasta haha."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! Excellent food, friendly, knowledgeable employees and a nice trendy atmosphere.  Arugula Salad has a crisp, citrus vinaigrette and topped with grated fresh parmesean.   Lasagna Bolognese is amazing. Layered by hand in a large bowl with incredibly thin sheets of pasta Ann's just the right amount of Bolognese.   If you want to end it with a phenomenal dessert, give the Stella di Nutella.  OMG. It's absolute heaven!"}
{"text":"It's hard to get a good feel for what Cibo Via is all about. Probably because I expect a similar experience to Cibo DT, I can't help it, it's clearly a more relaxed market experience with fast service.  But they just serve regular italian restaurant fare. I don't know what makes these street food? I'll have to scour through episodes of food shows to find out.  The food was great, albeit a little over priced. I'm ok with Via Cibo, but preferrably would go to the 17th ave restaurant for the similar food and price."}
{"text":"They just opened. Great decorum, and atmosphere; The arrangement and layout is really quite engaging; you really feel a good vibe. I had the alfredo linguini. A nice hint of clove in the sauce; it was nice. The staff seems to put in a good effort as well. The gelato was a touch pricey, but it was otherwise a good experience!"}
{"text":"My taste buds have been spoiled in Socal where good food is plentiful, affordable and authentic. It's turned me into a food snob where I refuse to go to a place that has anything less than 4 stars. The exception to my rule is when a fellow Yelper, whom I trust, recommends a place.  The lovely Shubhi A. suggested for us to meet up at Via Cibo (you say chee-bow) for a girly lunch date. I can see why she's a regular here: it's a stylish eatery with shiny metal light fixtures, artsy wall decor and with a pizza oven that looks likes it's bedazzled! Good for big groups with a large communal table and even an outdoor patio. Staff are as helpful and sweet as can be (tip - come as soon as they open on a weekday before the lunch rush if you like things quiet AND you want good service). Order at the cashier, choose your seat and they'll deliver your food to you.  WE ORDERED: Margherita (thin crust) pizza - crushed tomato sauce, Fior Di Latte and fresh basil. SHUBHI A. TIP - if you like a crisp crust but not hard, ask for it well done. It was ok, but Shubhi A. said it's usually better.  Mista salad with spinach, romaine, arugula, grape tomatoes, celery with white balsamic dressing. Simple and fresh.  Ossobuco Ragu pasta - shredded braised veal, broccolini, slow roasted tomato and Grana Padano Cheese. There was tender juicy meat in each forkful YUM! The pasta was softer than al dente which is how I like my pasta.  Stella di Nutella (you choose the flavor of your two sorbetto/gelato scoops) with a scoop of Raspberry lime, a scoop of Strawberry Rhubarb sorbetto, Nutella drizzle and a sprinkling of powdered sugar. YUM YUM YUM! The fruit flavored sorbettos paired perfectly with the ooey gooey melty chocolate and hazelnut Nutella.   Solid 3.5 for the food bumped up to 4 for their ambiance and wonderful service (Thursday early lunch time). Would definitely come back to try their brunch and take advantage of their awesome daily specials (see tip with pic). Thanks to Shubhi A. for suggesting this charming place."}
{"text":"Nice casual place for a quick dinner. Staff were friendly and attentive. Found the food itself a little boring, but tasty enough."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant quality pasta, the pizza is stone oven baked! Amazing! Can't go wrong if you get margherita! Love the ordering concept, perfect if you come alone or have kids. Nice and roomy."}
{"text":"I would give zero starts if possible. I went in there this evening, and met my friend who was already seated. We sat at our table for 51 minutes WITHOUT BEING ACKNOWLEDGED!   Under zero circumstances does that make sense. We were caught up in conversation  and by the time we realised how much time had actually passed (at that point we had been their about 25 mins) we decided to make a game of it and see if they didn't approach us by the time we were finished talking, we wouldn't order. 51 minutes later, and we were all caught up and still no service. It was unfortunate because I had really bad dry mouth- and I am an excellent tipper!  Worst experience in the city as far as dining is concerned. Take tsk guys."}
{"text":"Always wanted to try ,  finally got my chance.  Food was average at best. It was barely warm when it arrived . The pollo parm was soggy , the chicken and portabello was bland. Garlic bread was tasty though.  All in all , far too much money for what is best described as Sbarro upscaled.  Plus , being promoted to tip before getting any food or service always seemed backwards to me."}
{"text":"Via cibo is an italian restaurant that specializes in italian street food. Came here a few times before but got brunch here for the 1st time with the boyfriend today.   Overall solid spot, maybe 1 step below specialty brunch places like emma's country kitchen or lady marmalade, but the great thing is that there's no line-ups!  I got the pancetta and sundried tomato frittata and my boyfriend got the prosciutto arugula benedict. The frittata was decent even if a little on the thin side. I could taste the sundried tomatoes a lot more than the pancetta. I also wish there was a little more cheese. The portion size was good and it was reasonably priced.   The prosciutto eggs benny was an interesting twist on an old classic, in a good way. The bread was a departure from the classic english muffin. They used their own sourdough bread which was soft and delicious. The salad was quite basic but that's to be expected as a brunch side salad. The hollandaise was decent but didn't stand out. The egg wasn't poached as neatly but the prosciutto and arugula, along with the zest in the hollandaise definitely provided an interesting take on this old classic.   Looking forward to trying their tiramisu french toast and blueberry lemon ricotta pancakes!"}
{"text":"TINY SERVING SIZE, POOR FOOD QUALITY:  You would think this place is reasonably priced because it is self served and casual but it is NOT.  Serving size for all our pasta dishes were small and the shrimps on our pasta were few, tiny and chewy.  Since the mains were small, we needed one full appetizer per person.  The price per pasta dish was about $14 to $17 which is only a couple of bucks less than a high quality restaurant like Santos and Novita.  It comes out to about the same price if you went to a higher end Italian restaurant and had one entree, free bread and half an appetizer per person.  And you would enjoy yourselves much more!"}
{"text":"Via Cibo contacted me via instagram (@to.masticator) and invited me and my companion to indulge in a complimentary meal this past weekend.  Via Cibo offers affordable, delicious, authentic Italian street food, from flatbread pizzas to pasta and salad. The ordering system is super efficient - you order at the front, find a seat, and they bring your food to you. This place is very modern looking and is the perfect spot for lunch or a date night.   We started with the Italian sodas - Black Cherry and Mango.  Both were refreshing, though we liked the Black Cherry a bit more. Highly recommend.  Next, we tried the Gnocchi - Gorgonzola Cream Sauce, Pancetta, Slow Roasted Tomato, Green Onion, Grana Padano Cheese - $14.  Not surprisingly, being one of the most popular dishes at Via Cibo, it was delicious.  My companion ordered the Tiramisu French Toast - Thick Cut Egg Bread, Mascarpone, Espresso, Cinnamon, Vanilla, Chocolate Chips - $15- from the Brunch menu (they offer brunch Sat, Sun, Holiday Mondays 10am-3pm).  It was also great - fluffy and not overly sweet.  Tuscan Fries - $5 - This dish was mentioned as a must-order in a few Yelp reviews, and rightly so.   Via Poutine - $9 - This was my companion's favourite dish. Topped with a generous portion of ossobuco, it's the perfect fusion of authentic Italian with a Canadian classic.  Mushroom Pizza - We were stuffed from all of the other dishes that we took most of this pizza home.  When I brought it home, my mom and sister devoured it and told me that it was really good.  I concur.  Overall, great experience at Via Cibo.  Their ordering system is super efficient, and the food is delicious, authentic, and affordable. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is decent, nothing worth writing home about   Both had different pasta dishes both 2/5  I am guessing the sandwiches and pizzas are probably better so I suggest opting for those of you happen to choose this place  Set up and workers are nice but forgettable food make this one I would not suggest to anyone whatsoever  Disclaimer: I live in Woodbridge and am probably a little tougher on Italian restaurants due to the wealth of great options in my area"}
{"text":"Had a very unique and tasty sausage and egg dish called Eggs Al Forno. I've never had anything like that for breakfast/ brunch. It had spicy Italian sausage all throughout with grilled veggies and two eggs baked on top. I also tried a bite of my boyfriend's Tiramisu French Toast that was as thick as about 5 slices of normal bread and pumped full of tiramisu filling. Very fluffy.  Via Cibo would have received a higher review if I were not factoring in the service and operation of the establishment. The set-up of the restaurant is strange, you order food and pay for it at one counter and then you order drinks at a separate counter and pay again. Then you kind of just stand there and look around for a seat, many of which have a super tiny reserved sign on them that you can barely see and if you accidentally sit down at one such table, be prepared to be snapped at by a waitress that you CAN NOT SIT THERE.  I'm hoping my next visit will be better."}
{"text":"Only got to try this place once but it was awesome  Menu looks quite tasty  Had to take some time to peruse through  Finally had the Calabrese piadina  Quite yummy  Had a nice kick to it too with the spicy sausage   Wanted to try the fries but the piadina was filling enough   Would def go back again"}
{"text":"Overall, my first experience here was pretty good. The interior is modern, and the menu is well organized and not too overwhelming. The food came within 5 minutes, but the restaurant was not busy at the time. Carbonara was delicious, the flavour of the shrimp really stood out. However, my Americano tasted like hot water. The staff could use more training as they either did not acknowledge me, or was extremely awkward when they did. Although, manager came by and was friendly. The variety of restaurants in this area is scarce, so I do highly recommend you try viacibo if you want Italian but don't feel like making the journey downtown!"}
{"text":"I can't believe how fast it was for our food to come out.  The place itself is not big, but I guess the turnover is really quick due to the fast food type atmosphere.  The food is decent and in line with the prices they are charging.  I had the Tuscan Braised Beef ($16) and it was fantastic.  We will come back to try out more of their menu items."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst food I've ever tasted in my entire life I had high expectations because of other peoples reviews and I was sadly let down the service was horrible not budget friendly the food tasted horrible I can't even describe how disgusting the sandwich was that I got the lettuce or arugula tasted like it hadn't been washed ..perhaps expired me and my date couldn't finish our food and when I asked for a complementary coffee or anything seeing how we spent $45 they had to ask management which gave us free coffee that everybody else gets anyways I can't Believe how much it cost it let me down beyond all words if I had the power to shut this restaurant down because of this one experience I would shame on you for opening a restaurant shame !! Italian food does not taste like this I can't believe how much good reviews you have perhaps it was the sandwich that I ate are usually give restaurants a second chance but this restaurant left a bad taste in my mouth figuratively and metaphorically"}
{"text":"we ordered from their branch menu today amd i think  for the price it was fantastic. fresh ingredients well presented and friendly staff. comfortable and stylish resturant and child friendly :)"}
{"text":"Good Italian fast food. Very nice atmosphere. Although price is just a little high, but pasta is not bad. We had the shrimp pesto pasta which had good amount of sauce. Someone suggested us to try their fries and we tried it but did not like it."}
{"text":"Love the pizzas and the tuscan fries are just amazing the pastas are also very fresh the bombolini is also great!! Little overpriced but good quality."}
{"text":"Ambience & decor: contemporary(3.5 stars) Food: mediocre, overpriced (2 stars), vegetarian unfriendly.  I ordered a  pizza margherita & it probably was the worst margherita pizza I've had in my life. Underdone & tasteless. They covered it up by drizzling copious amounts of olive oil! The other dishes at the table were a pesto pasta, tuscan fries, &, portobello piadini. The pasta was aldente but the pesto sauce was so-so. The piadini was good. The tuscan fries were okay - nothing to rave about.  This is a self service place with limited bottles of seasonings. The service is poor. Scowling or unfriendly servers. They did not have fresh pepper mills & when I asked the server reluctantly got a pepper mill from another table & rushed us to take it back!  I reluctantly ordered a cappuccino which was surprisingly good. There must be a dearth of good Italian restaurants in this area since it was crowded.  Their brunch menu on weekends looks interesting but will I go back? Not sure if I want to try it a second time.  We did go back a second time for brunch. The serving staff who took our order was nice but the lady at the checkout couldn't be bothered to tell us the flavors of italian ices!  The tiramisu french toast & goat cheese frittata were very good unlike the dinner entrees the previous time, with adequate portion sizes. The cranberry pecan french toast was priced as a brunch entree but served as a small dessert item.  This restaurant is the classic case of having the right food but failing at management & operations."}
{"text":"Via Cibo is a favourite among my coworkers and I as a lunch spot for it's fast service and reasonably priced but very delicious Italian food.   My usual order is the Calabrese Sausage Piadina, which is like a sausage wrap (it's wrapped in the flatbread because the filings are wet and would fall out otherwise - I was told by one of the workers). The sausage and even flatbread is all made in house so it's very fresh. It comes with a tiny side salad. I would also say the wrap is about a medium level of spicyness so I like to add extra hot sauce, albeit I am a hot sauce fiend.   I've also tried the Piccante and Margarita pizzas, both delicious and very filling! My coworkers also rave about the Pomodoro pasta and the Cavolo salad (kale salad).   The italian fruit soda is a must! It's very refreshing and just the right amount of fizzyness. They also come in various flavours that you wouldn't expect. I don't usually get dessert so I've only had it once as it was complimentary. I can't remember the name but they were like these deep fried dough balls that had brown sugar on them. They were made in-house and so delicious.   The service is usually pleasant although not very attentive once you're seated, which makes sense as they are not a conventional sit-down restaurant. However I was easily able to wave someone down if I required something.   This plaza gets insanely busy during the lunch rush so I would recommend going right before or after (11:30am or 1:00pm) lunch."}
{"text":"The bowl was less than half full. For 18$ I don't think this was a sufficient amount of pasta at all. Ordered with extra broccolini and it cane with one piece cut up. I didn't realize it was 2.00$ a stem. Not happy at all with this. I ordered the gnocchi in cream sauce. Extremely displeased. Pasta is over cooked."}
{"text":"Cafeteria style dining. Good service, good food. My only issue is the price. For a family of four we each had an entree, side salad and drinks (Non-alcoholic). Food portions were far from generous. The bill came to a hair over $80. Definitely NOT what one would consider value-for-money."}
{"text":"Italian food like Nonna used to make...they must be kidding! We dropped on tonight for a quick dinner. They close at 10 and it was only 8:30 but the chairs were up on most of the tables...not very welcoming. We ordered and paid at the cash and the food was delivered to the table. My wife had overcooked linguine and I had overcooked chicken parmigiano with a side of overcooked linguine. The one positive...the tomato sauce was good. I see most of the Yelp reviews are about lunches. Perhaps the afternoon chef has a clue...but dinner...forget about it."}
{"text":"I gave this review 3 stars because of both the price and portion. Unfortunately this time round, i didn't find the staff at the register overly friendly with no real acknowledgement of my  arrival. Yet all this being said, you do get a fair amount for what you pay, and food is good. When you enter, there is the ordering menu to the right, along with a cash register. (They also deliver the food to your table) All of the names are different, and for say more complex then any other Italian restaurant menu, so be sure to look at the description bellow the title of the item before ordering it! I personally had the margarita pizza, the dough is fresh and so is the rest of the ingredients. Another one to try on the menu is the braised beef... Although it might not look like much, it is quite rich and filling, so you may have to share, or get the rest packaged up to go. The overall visit was satisfying, despite some of the staff, and will probably be coming back in the near future!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for lunch! Came here with some work friends and enjoyed the balsamic chicken salad and some pizza on the patio. The salad was one of the best I've ever had and the service was excellent and super fast. I highly recommend that everyone check out this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I was positively impressed with our experience at Via Cibo tonight. The manager, David, and his team were extremely patient with our especially particular group (of 12 people) and provided fantastic service. The food was wonderful, the staff was accommodating, and we couldn't recommend this place more. Thank you! :)"}
{"text":"Food: 3 Service: 2 Atmosphere: 2  My aunt and uncle have been raving about this place and excited to take my sister and I here and we've had our expectations set high! Unfortunately Via Cibo disappointed in almost every aspect.   The first member of the staff who took our order was curt, cold and unfriendly and rushed us through without any warmth or a smile of any kind. To be fair he warmed up a little bit more throughout our meal but not by much.   Speaking of cold, the place itself was freezing!! We thought it was because they just opened their doors at 3 when we came and that it would warm up, but nope it stayed cold and we could feel the cold air blowing. The layout of the place was nice but when it's that cold it's hard to enjoy it.   We ordered the arugula salad with shrimp, the pollo a pesto pizza, gnocchi and Tuscan fries. The Tuscan fries were the most mediocre, and I was expecting them to be amazing after all the reviews rated them quite highly. They were served cold and tasteless unfortunately! The salad was good and the shrimp were delicious. The pizza was okay, nothing special, and the gnocchi was tasty but again nothing to write home about.   We decided to get some coffee and dessert and ordered the Nutella dessert (I forget the full name, Stella di something). They warned us it would take 15 minutes and it took 20 to come out which I knew would take long since they warned us but cmon.   Then in the middle of waiting for our dessert, the dude who took our order comes and tells us that they forgot to charge us for the shrimp and asked us to pay for the difference. Again he wasn't rude at all, but when YOU make the mistake and forget to put it on the bill, shouldn't it be you that takes responsibility for it? I'm not upset about the $6 but to come and ask us to settle almost 40 minutes after we order is ridiculous.   The coffees and desserts were fine but I was so turned off from the experience that I was supposed to meet friends here right after and changed the location to second cup so that I wouldn't have to give them any more of my business."}
{"text":"Ordered here via Skip the Dishes when I knew I wasn't going to have any time to make dinner.  Kids 4 cheese pizza on a nice thin crust- pretty comparable to a nice \"Neapolitan style \" but without the higher price tag.  I had the kale salad which I just shouldn't have,  if it is not Una's kale Cesar - it was edible and I liked the bits of prosciutto, but i enjoy Una's kale Cesar too much to try other kale salad options.  I had a taste of the meatball sub, which was hearty with a substantial bun to hold everything in and compliment the saucy meatballs.  Overall, this place is pretty good value for the tasty, thin crust \"Neapolitan style\" stone oven pizza."}
{"text":"Looking for an Italian restaurant in the area Via Cibo seemed to have some great reviews.  Hence I decided to take a date here since we've both never been to this venue.   Upon entering its not your usual dining experience, first you'd have to follow a path where you'd be advised to choose what to eat.....then a few yards down is where you order drinks.  For food we both ordered two types of pizza; Pollo al pesto and their Casaglina, along with two glasses of red wine.   Both gourmet pizzas were well prepared and presentation was quite impressive.  What I liked most about this place, aside from the food was the open concept!  The only downside to this place is the limited seating, and if there aren't any seats then you are out of luck!.........  would I come back, I would if I'm in the area, but would not go out of my way to come here just because of the set up of how the restaurant has its set up. Food is awesome though! so kudos to that!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while and finally had my chance.    First of all the menu disappoints.  This is not really street food.   It's an Italian restaurant with a cafeteria style ordering.   All the price points of the sit down place without the service and the food quality of the cafeteria without the speed.   The whole thing is just a little.... hmmm.... confused. The drinks were pretty good however.   The bill came out uncomfortably high and nothing made me want to come back.   Every item I've had better elsewhere for the same price or less.    Honestly probably not into try this out again."}
{"text":"Via Cibo is like gourmet fast food. The food comes out quick but it actually tastes good and is a lot healthier than your McDonald's/Wendy's/Burger King, etc. The interior design is also a lot nicer and the chairs are very comfortable. Once you enter, you put in your order, then pass through their open kitchen. You can see how they cook the food. At the end of the line is where you pay. You then get your number and go find a place to sit. When your food is ready, they will bring it to your table. I really liked their Pasta Al Ragu Di Ossobuco. Their pizza's are also unique and very filling for one person. They have a brick oven which makes the pizza even better. My personal favorite is the prosciutto e arugula which has a drizzle of fig infused balsamic vinaigrette. The hit of the fig is unique and makes the pizza even better.  Overall, a very good place to get your Italian fix if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Good not great for overall food on the menu.  Very pricey for what you get in my opinion.  Truffle fries were amazing the first visit but not so great after you've tried them a couple times.  Pizza is a bit dry and pastas are a bit bland.  It's the only Italian place around my area so I come here only when I'm really craving Italian and I don't want to go too far for food."}
{"text":"Really good pizzas and sandwiches. Bread is really fresh and soft. Very comfortable place to eat."}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 6 times & really liked this restaurant until December 4th (Wed.) I called at 9:20 PM to order a meal I was picking up. They are supposed to be open until 10 PM. It used to be later. First I was asked if I could pick it up by 9:40 PM. I said yes. So I ordered a chicken portobello mushroom meal I had eaten previously which is $16 or $17. It consists of 2 thin pieces of chicken breast in a cream sauce with 3 slices of portobello mushroom on top and a small side of pasta in a cream sauce. I also ordered a caesar salad for $9.   This is not large place.The decor is  nice  but it is small and you are looking out onto a parking lot and then the parking lot for the Real Canadian Superstore. The last time I was there it was empty except for a couple who was making out so much they should have gotten a room. Seriously!!Maybe it's the parking lots that makes people think they can make a quick exit if the guy's wife shows up!!  They advertise \"fresh food\".  I expected to get better food as I have been to classy Italian places that charge less for a salad and do not leave the hard white bottom stalks of romaine lettuce in the salad. Even worse, the cut ends looked brown and old. The bacon bits were burned. Yuck I had to throw 1/3 of the salad out! Then I was told they were out of mushrooms so I ordered the chicken meal without.  I asked for butternut squash soup (which has been and still is advertised right by the meal menu at the cash) I was told they don't have any of those items they are seasonal. Well, I just saw that menu go up a short time ago, take it down if you don't offer any of the items. The 2 girls working there were not very friendly and really rushed when I went in to pick up the food. I think your money and time would be better spent elsewhere or they need new employees. I didn't have this experience the other times I was there. So be aware that it may be like that when you go. Also if you are open til 10 PM please don't tell people you are closing at 9:20 PM. We all like to leave work but this will just get hungry people mad!!"}
{"text":"We've been here many times and normally the food is really good! Today however the service was very much lacking. The restaurant was not busy - there may have even been more staff than there were customers. However our eggs Benedict was slow to arrive at the table and it was cold. The servers were busy chatting and folding pizza boxes so I guess they were too preoccupied to notice that our food was ready.  I had to go up to the counter to ask for more coffee, and no one asked us how our food was."}
{"text":"The chicken \"piadina\" is like nothing I have ever had. A fajita wrap filled with succulent chicken, spinach, goat cheese, and grilled onions makes for a one-of-a-kind dish. The meatball sandwich and veal Oso Bucco are also excellent. Be aware: this place is incredibly overpriced. Prices are too high, but the food is very good."}
{"text":"Great place to grab Italian in a clean modern environment. Fast clean no frills service. Self service pop fountain. Definitely one of the best places for pasta in the North East area of Calgary. Just opened yesterday and seems to be quite busy today. Middle of the range price."}
{"text":"I've only been here once: I will have to go back to allow them the opportunity to 'wow' me.  The layout is great for fast Italian food.  Staff are friendly.  Food was delicious: the pizza was huge, the Carbonara dish was regular size, the soup and the cappuccino were rather small.  Prices were a little high but of course, you are getting treated to an authentic Italian experience.  Oh, if you like ketchup on your pizza think about bringing your own - they have no ketchup here ... my partner likes ketchup on his pizza and I have to say it: it does taste good with it on!"}
{"text":"Was heading down 17th for lunch and of course parking was an issue so after pulling round off 14th to try again, we saw this place and they had a parking lot. Awesome concept where you order, but there is also a server for drinks and food delivery. Nice decor and I ordered the chicken alfredo. My companion ordered a calabrese sausge piadina (flatbread), that was super messy and tasty.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Great food. Reasonable prices.  We ordered the Picante pizza and the gnocchi. Both portion sizes were  what you would expect. Food tasted excellent.  We are definitely coming back. Order taker very nice, waiter seemed to have a bit of an attitude.  Overall fantastic experience."}
{"text":"\"This place is going to make me fat\"  You too might be saying this after your first meal here. The food is delicious and you'll be wanting to eat here every day.  Unlike their downtown location, this is the fast and friendly version of Cibo. They are serving up Italian street food at prices that won't leave a hole in your pocket. You order first, take a number on a stand, and then find a table.  The \"street food\" description could be a little misleading. Don't think food truck style meals. Think street-side cafe. The portions are lunch-sized but so are the prices. You won't be getting a big, heavy Italian meal; just something the right size to fill you up.  The fiancee and I came on opening night. When we were driving home from work we saw the \"now open\" signs going up so we ran our errands and circled back to have dinner. The place was busy, but not packed. Just as fast as people were walking in, tables were turning over to make room for more.   When you walk in you place your order first. There's a nice large menu that could be easily read if there is a long line. Its broken down into a few main categories like salads, wraps, pasta, pizza, and sides. The prices for the mains come in around the $9-14 range.  My lady and I got the Pasta Al Pesto, Picante Pizza, and Tuscan Fries to share so that we could try a few things. The pasta was cooked nicely and had a good flavour. One of the ingredients was sun dried tomatoes which usually means there might be a few flecks scattered throughout the dish. Not in this bowl. There were nice big chunks of them and more than enough to bring out the amazing flavour they always have.  The pizza was good and hit the spot, though not the best you can get for this style of pizza. If you want something fast with great ingredients then this is a good choice. However, if you want a pizza in this style that's done really well then this isn't the place for you. The crust was really wet. Yes I know that this is supposed to be a wet pizza, but this was a little too much. Maybe it should have been left in the oven for a few seconds longer.  The tuscan fries were excellent. The rosemary flavour really carried throughout. The fries were light and crispy and the sauce on the side added a tang to finish it off.  The service was great. You could see that all of the staff were eager with many of them sporting big smiles. We maybe had to wait five minutes before our meals came out. Closer to the end of our dinner the manager came around to ask how things were and to see if the food was satisfactory.  Overall it was an excellent experience. I'll be back many times in the future, though probably not so often that I actually will get fat from eating here."}
{"text":"Food is great, but service leaves much to be desired for the cost.   The layout of confusing. In that you order and pay at stations and are expected to carry your own drinks to the table, even if it requires returning to the bar several times.   They do bring your food to your table after a few minutes which is normal, yet when we asked for our dessert we were told to go back to the bar and inform them. Seems the staff is too lazy to even commutate with each other.   I wouldn't have a problem with either and all take out or all sit down style. But this mixture of methods, changing it seems during the meal, is annoying as well as leads to long delays and confusion between customers and staff.   It's too bad this place can't find a rhythm, the food is incredible but the overall rushed feeling combined with delayed service is not worth the price."}
{"text":"A special trip to Via Cibo is warranted after working up an appetite navigating the mazes of Ikea. The restaurant's name translates to \"Street Food\", which begs one to think of simple Italian yumminess: paninis, pizzas, sandwiches and pastas.   The prices are slightly (about $1 to $2) cheaper than other local Italian restaurants with similar offerings (Famoso, Double Zero, Una). The ordering/paying process is cumbersome. You order at the first till, pay and grab a number at the second till at the other end of the counter, choose a table and they'll bring you your order.   I'm going to tell you right now most of their menu is mediocre except their pizzas. You SHOULD spend your money and belly room on their pizzas. Their prosciutto arugula pizza is one of the best I've had in Calgary. I love the whole tomatoes in the sauce, the generous topping of arugula, and the flavorful prosciutto even though it was cooked.The crust is light and airy yet hearty enough to fill hungry bellies.  They have a good selection of coffees, Italian sodas and Fiasco Gelato. We make our own floats with Sanpellegrino and Gelato.   I love the self serve water fountain, chili oil, and chili flakes. Despite the convenience setup, the staff are nice and friendly. We were pleasantly surprised when they gave us freshly grated Parmesan after we couldn't find Parmesan shakers. They've got none of that sawdust powder most people lovingly call \"cheese\".  If you happen to be in the area, skip the chain restaurants and get great quality pizza at Via Cibo. Your belly will thank you."}
{"text":"Staff don't seem to listen to any order customisation and the service is extraordinarily slow. Food was fine, but there's a good chance it wasn't what you ordered and good luck getting it corrected within the time it takes for the meal to get cold. ."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. Came for dinner with new friends and left very full and a little tipsy. You order, pay and they bring everything to you. I skipped desert but next time for sure will save room for the brownie and gelato."}
{"text":"This place would get 4 stars if the service was a bit better and they had more veg options. The food is reasonably good - we as a family of three had the Tuscan fries, a pesto pasta, margarita pizza and a piadina sandwich with Portobello and goat cheese. The last named was very good, the pasta good and the pizza disappointing. For the price of sit down dining, the ambience is sparse and service pedestrian. We wanted some fresh pepper but were told that another table has the pepper grinder but we could borrow it for 10 seconds. I mean I they are limited then they should not on anyone's table. The redeeming feature was the cappuccino and the French press coffee both of which were excellent.   The brunch menu looks great and we will try it sometime. But no return trip for dinner."}
{"text":"A nice mix of casual / mid end dining. Interesting order, pay and sit concept, don't see that much in Toronto. You order when you first step in - then you move all the way down the way to pay for your meal - they give you a card and then you sit down wherever you want and then they bring you your meal.     I ordered the pruscito piadina - it's essentially a wrap filled with salty prosciutto, arugula, mozzarella, garlic aloli, and some type of balsamic reduction. The wrap was good. All the flavours compliment each other very well! The presentation was nice - they spelled out the restaurant's name with some type of aioli. I also got a blood orange soda. It was tasty, not too sweet!   My friend got the recommended Ossobuco Panino. braised veal, caramelized onions, arugula and cheese. She enjoyed it.   We split a side order of The truffle fries - couldn't really taste the truffle oil, but the  rosemary and the shaved grana padano cheese really made for some tasty fries.   I like this place, the food is good. However, the prices are STEEP for such a casual dining experience. The food is tasty, but it's not the most \"bang for your buck\" option."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I need to lower my rating of this place.  The pizzas are not quite as good as they were nor is that current staff as good as the initial people who were there.   On one recent visit, a pizza topped with prosciutto had it added before baking, causing it to become burnt.  (In Italy, prosciutto crudo is added after baking.)  And on another a \"wild mushroom\" pizza was bland and had little strong mushroom flavour.  Also. on our last visit, the place had insufficient heat and we needed to keep our coats on.  It's still not a bad place, but the quality has declined somewhat from when it opened."}
{"text":"Always delicious here  We enjoyed the penne and asked for a rose mix of alfredo and tomato sauce. Also very good was the Tuscan fries. - last visited August 2016"}
{"text":"Was craving Italian my entire trip to Canada! So many different Italian places, but Cibo was a constant recommendation! So glad I gave it a whirl before I left. Their menu is packed with traditional Italian recipes and more! Their pizza was cooked perfectly with an airy crust, just how I prefer it. The portions were perfect for sharing and their family meal was a steal! If you love causal Italian, but the flavor of fine dining, you'll love Cibo!"}
{"text":"We thought we'd hit up Via Cibo for a quick lunch bite. They have a bright and open restaurant with a modern decor. The menu has a variety of Italian dishes from salads, sandwiches and pasta dishes.  We had the Insalate Cesare with chicken added and the Pollo Alla Griglia piadina.   I enjoyed my padina, it was flavourful and unique to a standard sandwich. But for $13.00 that's all it was. No sides and really not much for cooking required to make one. This to me is quite expensive.  The salad was decent with the chicken, but  again for $11.00 this was way over priced. It was a small side salad.  We also bought a Italian soda, which again $3 for a small glass seems exessive. Over all the lunch was $28 dollars before tip. And I would expect to pay maybe half for what we ended up with.   Also the bathroom toilet was broken and stuffed with toilet paper, not sure how often they tend to the bathrooms."}
{"text":"After finding out recently I have a Wheat Allergy, it has been a royal pain in the butt to find Gluten free options. I love that this was listed in Yelp as Gluten Free Friendly and Italian Bistro. The girl was knowledgeable and told me my options, the food was delicious and fresh. They even have a Gf desert menu... Tiramisu and lots of gelato! A great bar and drink option. I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and I can't wait to come back! The service was great and the food was amazing. I had the carbonara on penne and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation-very enticing!. I especially enjoyed my favourite Piadina with tempting bombolini for dessert:)) and my son's favourite, tiramisu french toast,fries and pizza of course! Will definitely come back for more and will recommend this location to my friends and family. Great service and lovely modern location with awesome staff!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try out the new kid on the block. Met up with a few friends on a Monday night. They didn't have their liquor license yet, but no issues there. As it turns out it arrived the next day so they are licensed people.  It's a self serve style set up. Decide what you want, order it, pay, and they bring it to you. Our group tried a variety of items, meatballs, salad, pasta, fries and of course, pizza. Everything had flavour and our group was happy. Although the arugula had seen better days both on the pizza and in the salad. The fries on the other hand, truffle fries, and osso bucco fries...holy hanna delicious!  The pizza was Neapolitan style, albeit soggy in the middle. Flavour was there and I'm hoping being newbies they are just ironing out the kinks. They sell their food as street food and there are quite a few different menu items to choose from.  I love that it's a family restaurant and I can bring my kids one day. We will be back."}
{"text":"Recently opened, this is a new concept of Italian food in Toronto. Although they feature a cafeteria style restaurant, it's very modern and trendy in décor. We only tried a couple of dishes as it was late at night, but the hub has been here several times and it's quite busy especially at lunch time. I tried the baked prosciutto stuffed with fior di latte, and it was good. Their pizzas and panini look great! They also serve Italian wine and beer! Will certainly be coming back!  Edit: Came back about a month later to try their pizza and pasta. We had a pizza margherita (if you can't do this one right ...) and a pomodoro meatball linguini. The pizza was actually quite good, thin crust, cooked just right. Same with the pasta, it was perfectly al dente. I also tried some of their red wine and it was decent.  One complaint: I wanted to try one of their little dessert/puddings but no one in the whole restaurant could tell me what flavour it was. I guess there is no communication with the pastry chef; they should at least invest in some labels.  Still, good food and good value!"}
{"text":"Very clean/fresh Italian food at affordable prices. Try their pastas and paninos! Wasn't really feeling their Italian Sodas"}
{"text":"This is a really neat & busy restaurant. The food is amazing & delicious. I've eaten here 3-4 times & have not been disappointed. I had a chicken wrap (not called a wrap) & it was delicious. What was nice was I also ordered an espresso & the staff waited till lunch was eaten & then delivering my espresso. Nicely done. This is a recommend from me."}
{"text":"This trendy Casual Italian restaurant is good. There is enough variety on their menu and the food is very good and fresh almost gourmet homemade. I am addicted to their sandwich with Bbq'd steak,roasted tomatoes, carmelized onions,arugula and garlic mayo on it. You can even have it on 2 types of bread if you ask. I mostly get takeout. Eating there you get a view of the Superstore Parking lot. Get a table in the back. Reasonable prices too!!"}
{"text":"3.5  Pros: Food made to order Prices are pretty good  Cons: Food won't wow you  My wife found this place while looking for an Italian restaurant to have a dinner with her friends.  We would be coming here with 2 other couples and their kids so we decided to give this place a test run with just our own family first.  Via Cibo has a upscale feel in a casual setting.  You order at the front and the staff brings you your food.  Their specialty is Italian street food.  We decided to keep it safe and order the basics.  It's very kid friendly but the middle table with the really high chairs need to be avoided if you have young kids.  There are still enough tables for everyone.  If you come in a large group like we plan to later, you are pretty much reduced to one side of the restaurant though so plan accordingly.    As I said, we stuck to the basics and got a pasta and pizza.  We got something off the kids menu and the Tuscan fries because everyone on Yelp recommended them.   We were lucky enough to come on Monday where kids eat free as well!    My wife's ragu pasta was pretty good.  For most of their pastas, you can only choose between linguine or penne.  LIttle strange in my opinion.  My wife said it was good, but nothing to write home about.  A standard good pasta.  My pizza was made with a stone baked oven.  I'm pretty sure they're going for a Neapolitan pizza here.  The crust is razor thin which is nice.  However, they don't char the crust like they should with a thin crust so when you get to the last 2 slices, the crust has no foundation anymore and gets trick to eat in your hands.  Also, without the char, you miss out on the balance of taste you should get with the tomato sauce.  Again, pretty good, but won't amaze you.    To all yelpers though, the Tuscan fries were as good as every one of you has claimed.  My daughter could not stop eating them.  If the sauce it came with wasn't spicy, she would of devoured that as well!  All in all, Via Cibo is a nice little place to come with the family.  You'll get a decent Italian meal at a very good price.  It won't amaze you, but it will get the job done."}
{"text":"The food was so good here! I ordered the chicken and portobello with Alfredo pasta and it was delicious! My husband got the polpette (meatball) panini and by the time I asked for a bite it was all gone lol !! Good portion sizes too."}
{"text":"This place is a TOTAL FIND in a small strip mall like area of Don Mills and York Mills. The decor is open and modern, allowing for casual fast dining, but not so stark that I wouldn't stay for a few drinks after dinner. You order your meal as soon as you walk in the door, which for someone as indecisive as me, is a difficult thing. However, the staff as eager to answer any questions and offer their suggestions, so even I can make a decision. The open kitchen is fantastic. It's always nice to actually see how your food is being made. Drinks are ordered farther down the counter and they have several italian beers on tap.   I had the broccolini and sausage pasta. The sausage is homemade, and you can tell care was put into making this delicious sausage \"meatballs\". The broccolini was plentiful and balanced the linguini. I asked for spicy and the flavour went well with the bitter greens, however the dish ended up being a little too oily due to the chilli oil. I wished the heat would have been added with chilli flakes instead. My dining partner ordered the pollo al pesto, and I managed to steal a bite. And I mean literally steal, because it looked so good he didn't want to let me have some! (It was delicious, by the way.)"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm mmmmm, mmm m! Although Via Cibo claims to be Italian street food, the two years I spent in Italy I seldom came across food al fresco as sophisticated as this.  I wish Yelp had 1/2 stars because 3 isn't enough and 4 is over doing it. I am a tough reviewer.   I've eaten here on many occasions. It's a fav place for me to take my employees cuz the food packs a punch for the buck. I find the pricing very wallet friendly and the atmosphere comfortable and slightly upscale in an unpretentious way. I've tried nearly everything that could be eaten by a lacto/ovo vegetarian and my fav by far is the Gorgonzola Gnocchi sans the pancetta. The slow roasted tomatoes are like dessert to me. The pizzas are best when ordered on $8. dollar pizza day because there's not much to a Napolitano Pizza so getting the special brings it in line with getting what you pay for. The only detractors for me are the fact that you don't get asked if you'd like any fresh cracked black pepper or additional Parmesan cheese but it is available if you follow the server back to the counter for it.   As with any place there are the inevitable bumps here and there with the most notable being on my last visit when I found the gnocchi to be mushy as it was obviously overcooked. I mentioned it to an employee in the kitchen but was met with a blank stare and I didn't pursue it because I was on a short time leash. This glitch however, was not enough to deter me as I will return for sure."}
{"text":"The food and environment are excellent. They have some of the best gluten free pasta I have ever had. The food ingredients were fresh and the food was cooked with obvious skill. This will be a regular stop for our family :-)"}
{"text":"I really liked this place - awesome service, modern decor and yummy food. But then I return home that afternoon with the worst case of food poisoning. I got the Cavolo salad with seared tuna. The tuna did taste a bit off/bland but it had the tastiest salad dressing. I didn't know better.   My fiancé got the spicy sausage pizza and his brother got the penne in ragu sauce. Both of them were fine (neither got sick) and really liked their dishes. I had a taste of both - the ragu sauce was so tasty and the pizza dough was exactly the consistency I love - not too thick and chewy!   The manager was the sweetest lady too - when I asked to swap out the olives, she allowed me to sub it with other veggie. Initially I subbed it with roasted pepper with dressing on the side - after the staff forgot to leave the dressing the other side, she immediately took back my order and made it from scratch again - second time I also swapped out the lemon ricotta for sweet potato. My salad aside from the seared tuna was extremely yummy. I loved the mixture of pickled onion, roasted pepper and sweet potato. Why tuna why???   The price is a bit steep for a panera bread style Italian eat even with the extremely tasty food and friendly service. certainly not worth the dozens of toilet trips."}
{"text":"Its located very close to my home, so I visit Via Cibo a lot. Its ambiance is very attractive and is good for a date too. They have a limited menu, but each item is well prepared and can be customized a little. Their pizzas are baked to perfection, and taste superb. Pastas & salads are just fine. They have an unique breakfast menu and the weekend brunch menu is something, not to be missed.  The fries come topped with grana padano cheese and rosemary, umm... heavenly !!! A must try thing.  They have 5$ house wine- both red and white, a wide range of coffees and lattes. Some selection if gelato and desserts.   Their Italian sodas are amazing, for 3-4$   They have servers, but they go by pay first option. The staff is really cool. So basically you enter the restaurant by entry gate (separate from exit gate), order your food from the menu on the wall or booklet, then pay for it, you get a number and you get seated. Your order is served at your seat along with water/cutlery. you can hep yourself for any other thing you need like seasoning etc. And they do not ask for tip or even expect it. Although I do tip them, 'coz I feel so :)"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Italian food I have eaten in years. Had the Sausage And Brocolini. Out of this world. Ordered the Spicy version. It has spunk but very tastefully done. Great place for a casual get together, group meal. Definitely recommend this place to anyone look I g for good pasta.  Will try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Patronized this establishment last about 3 years ago. Loved the Osso Bucca Sandwiches then...no longer on the menu. My visit today was a disappointment. The place has deteriorated. Service slow, prices raised. Panino Polpette and Steak Italiana sandwiches which we ordered bland and not tasty. Requested well toasted, both arrived cold and hardly toasted. The floor of the restaurant unswept and dirty. Washrooms (both men's and women's) in bad state.(Reported this to staff) Food sent back. It was returned to us after a long wait, bread toasted a bit more, but meat balls and steak inside sandwiches now cold... Won't be going there again..."}
{"text":"Great family-friendly, casual resto with no pretensions, just good fresh food at a reasonable price. Some have called it pricey -- but it's good solid cooking with fresh ingredients and it's really no more expensive than many mid-priced Italian restaurants that are way worse.  Excellent selection of salads (we love the kale salad and the arugula salad). They aren't over the top crazy with ingredients and they go light on the dressing and cheese, but they're tasty and fresh (again with that word...) We typically order two large-size to share among two adults and a growing boy, and the restaurant has no problem with sharing, in fact they bring us small bowls/plates to make it easier for us.  It's not a full-serve resto, so don't expect someone to come and replace the napkin on your lap when you sit down. You have to order and pay at the cash, but a server brings you the food. We've been there on fairly busy weekend nights and service is fast -- and you get to take your drink right away so I'd argue the service is BETTER than a traditional restaurant from that perspective.  Good selection of pizzas (which my boy would say is good but not the best in the city) but the pastas are where they really shine. Always delicious! My broccolini & sausage could use a bit more broccolini, but the osso buco ragu is awesome and I'm told the carbonara is decadently cheesy (creamy cheese pastas and I don't get along, so I've never tried it myself).  One minor complaint I would have is re the bread -- it's OK, but it's floury white bread. Would love it if they offered something more grainy/interesting.  Not much for dessert but the gelato is a nice finishing touch in the summer for those who want to indulge.  If you give Via Cibo a try, take note that the servers work hard even though it's not full-service. Remember to drop a tip in the bowl at the cash for them -- it's too easy to slip out without tipping, since you already paid when you ordered. They work hard and deserve something."}
{"text":"Visited on Saturday at 11:30am and enjoyed it so much we went again Sunday at 5pm!  Cute little place where you order first at the counter then they bring your food to the table. Service is very quick.   Sat- we had polpette to start. The boys liked it but the texture was a little hard and not as flavourful as I hoped. The sauce was tart and enough to mop up the 3 meatballs. My linguine carbonara was a bit saucy almost like a cream sauce vs the traditional carbonara that shouldn't leave much sauce on my plate but the noodles were perfectly cooked and not too salty with the pancetta. It came with a small bun which had a good chew and light middle.   Our son had penne Alfredo as part of a kids meal which was very tasty. Hubby ordered the picante pizza. Really yummy, thin crust with cornmeal dusting and not slathered in cheese. It was enough to hold the toppings together and it was very spicy from the chili oil- exactly the way hubby likes it!   The kids meal comes with dessert- gelato or bombolini. We chose the latter. They make them to order so these warm gooey Nutella filled balls of joy rolled in granulated sugar came out and was the perfect end to our meal. 4 in a half order or 8 in a full order. Soooo worth it! Hubby and I both had americanos which were very smooth and medium roast. Wonderful lunch!  Sunday 5pm/ not super hungry so I ordered the poutine with no cheese. It's definitely a meal with the amount of meat and sauce on the fries!  Hubby ordered the same pizza again as the day before!  For the price pint and quality, this is a good deal for upscale, Italian fast food. Clearly, we'll return to try more items as they have a really great brunch menu with French toast, eggs Benny and lemon blueberry ricotta pancakes. They also offer a Sunday family feast and have feature nights so check it out!"}
{"text":"It's not perfection and won't change your life, but it's tasty, with good portions and pricing and very good, very friendly service in a comfortable reno of what had been a decrepit Phil's pancake house. I've been three times; enjoyed the meatball and the steak panini and tasted a bit of partner's chicken parm panino that was very nice and very huge. Fries are from frozen (pretty sure) but quite competent and again a very good deal. Kale salad is pretty damn delicious. The only thing I didn't get was the piadina (I think) flatbread thing- it's folded into quarters and impossible to eat without knife and fork, very sloppy, not terrible tasting but very weird construction that needs to go back to square one. There's also fiasco gelato and freshly ground espresso- roast is WAY too dark for what we expect in an espresso in 2017 (think Starbucks circa 1999) but again it's ground fresh and is better than what one would expect in what's basically fast food."}
{"text":"Great spot for Italian Street Food!  Very great pasta and salad.  Prefer this location over the Country Hills location by far.  Perone is good on tap!  A great $60 lunch spot for 2 and a great house red wine!  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"More like 3.4 stars, not quite 3.5 - so I've rounded the rating down, my apologies.   I've been to Via Cibo when they've recently opened, and generally liked the place - except for that blast of chilling wind every time the door was opening.   If you can imagine an upscale cheap lunch place - which is not that cheap now that it's upscale - that's what VC is.   Smaller portions, fresh, well made food of decent variety. Sort of what Subway should have been if it wasn't Subway already.   I don't mind at all to drop in anytime, and you shouldn't either - just keep in mind it's getting busy during the lunch hours, and parking may not be available in the immediate vicinity of the front door."}
{"text":"Cool concept, open kitchen so you see the food being prepared as you wait in line to order, smells are in the air and amazing, Clean, hip, design and decor.."}
{"text":"It was fast, FRESH and delicious.   Came here for lunch before I went to work with a girlfriend. We got super eager and had bruschetta, cesare salad, gnocchi with pancetta and a pepperoni pizza.   We placed the order at the counter with a pleasant worker and took a seat. The food came out maybe 10-15 minutes later? Everything was hot and had amazing flavours. Obviously I was unable to finish it all, so we definitely had a bunch of food to take home (which by the way was still delicious when I heated it up later)  I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"As noted earlier, the system is quite different. Take your order (the order-taker was SO helpful in suggestions), shuffle past the open kitchen to the drinks-taker and find a seat in a stylish communal style dining area. Seats around 40 centred around one of those long tables with high chairs. Note: they serve Pepsi (if anyone cares). I ordered Pollo Alla Griglia Panino and Truffle Fries - came to $20. Date ordered Carbonara Pasta with grilled chicken (plus $4, wish they told us the extra cost when ordering) and a side of Insalata - $21. The sandwich felt very wholesome with their unique Calabrese artisan bread, packed with baby spinach, cheese, tomato, pancetta (Italian bacon, woo!), locally sourced fresh grilled chicken (!!) and a kick from the salsa verde aioli. Also came with a handful of arugula salad to make the plate feel complete. The truffle fries were nothing special, a nice touch with rosemary and subtle tones of truffle oil. I really enjoyed the dip that came with it, which ingredients were not listed. The pasta was traditionally al dente but leaned to a less flavour heavy of palates. The salad was also simple, with some grilled onions and other veggies. We sat down for barely five minutes and already my friend's pasta came out, funny how it beat the salad. Must be how the food order went through as soon as we walked away.   A comment on the system - date noticed how it felt strange to pay for the bill/tip at the beginning of the dinner. Her usual style is to tip based on the service, and as she stated, \"But no one has served me yet.\" Also, typical servers check the food with a 'two-bite rule' however this system places the responsibility on the consumer. Employees would walk around and pick up dishes however would walk past my empty glass until I asked someone to have it filled. We also felt the dining area was quite small when Sushi Kiku next door could fit twice as many - the layout of space seemed to push a higher turnover rate (since line ups created a bottleneck ).  Lastly, I had to wait a bit for my friend to arrive and being my first time, was confused as where to wait. I ended up sitting on the window sill by the order-taker who helped me pick my meal, but it felt very awkward.  Great food with socially-conscious management, super stylish, more of a quick, filling meal than the typical sit-down."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, casual ambiance, average prices and better-than-average food.   If you need to scratch that italian food urge then by all means this is the safest best (and quickest).   Just dont go in expecting a table-cloth restaurant."}
{"text":"Via Cibo offers excellent food at reasonable prices. I think I had the most expensive meal item there at $16 for lasagne. The place is well staffed, open, and has food for you ready quite shortly for the professional on the go. The service overall was excellent and proactive. There is a hint of burning in the air but definitely not too bad that it would be annoying. Their pizza is somewhere in between but if you're in a hurry this place would definitely be on my place of go to for quality food in a timely manner. There is plenty of open seating so you don't feel lobbed forward every time someone sits back. It's definitely a good place to meet friends, have a quick meeting or maybe a casual first date. The Italian soda there is a little on the weak  side in particular blackberry but the cherry worked out just right. The pizza isn't something I would rave about but it's alright. I initially didn't think the lasagne would be overly filling but it's so rich I didn't have any desire for dessert after."}
{"text":"I live nearby and didn't feel like cooking tonight, so I decided to come to Via Cibo for dinner. I walk into the restaurant and was shocked at how many dirty and uncleaned tables there are. Almost every other table has empty places and cups and garbage on them. It was disgusting. This place must be severely understaffed.  For this restaurant, you have to go up to the counter to make your order and pay, then take a number and sit at an empty table while your food is brought to you. The waiter who took my order was very rude. No smiles, no greetings, no nothing. The price is steep for a place that doesn't clean its tables on time and has rude staff. At this point I already have a bad feeling about the dinner not being an enjoyable experience, but I didn't want to walk out. So I stayed.  The order. I ordered a pasta. For the pastas here, you have a choice of penne or linguine, and choice of meat. I chose penne and sausage. What came was linguine and meatballs. I told them of the mistake and they quickly cooked me a new plate with the right order.  The food. It tasted pretty bland and nothing special.  I will not return."}
{"text":"This is a great place for brunch. It is a little on the small size, but the menu makes up for it.  It has a nice interior and the wait staff are very nice. When you walk-in you place your order at the front and then take your seat. They will bring your meal when it is ready.  Make sure you leave room for dessert. They have a nice selection of pastries and gelato.  The noise level is on the quiet side, so it is a great place to meet friends and catch up on old times."}
{"text":"Chicken pizza with goat cheese was a bit greasy. The Tuscan fries were amazing. Desserts are really tasty. Pastas are good. Nice decor."}
{"text":"This was our first time at cibo. We got 2 pastas and margarita pizza. Everything was delicious. We found the atmosphere very dirty. Food all over the floor and just not cleaned regularly. The atmosphere is a bit loud and confusing. If the atmosphere was more fine dining the quality of the same food would seem even better.   We enjoyed but not sure if we would eatbin again."}
{"text":"Braised Ragu Penne Pasta ($15)  Off the Bone Braised Veal Ragu pasta mixed with Broccolini, Slow Roasted Tomatoes and topped with shaved Grana Padano Cheese. The beef was braised nicely, the meat was tenderly split apart and not tough at all.   Carbonara ($13) The pasta was cooked just right, not too soft and not too chewy. This dish was flavorful and had its creamy touch. It did have a slight burnt taste mixed in the sauce, I think it came from the pancetta. I like how the pancetta was cooked really crispy though, adds a nice crunch to the pasta.   I think Levetto still does it better though, and cheaper too."}
{"text":"This score should be 4.5/5.   We, party of 2, came here for lunch two days ago.  We were a little curious what's this joint is all about, since we live close by.   We felt the interior is modern which is very nice. We place our orders and were given a number to pay at the cashier. The number is brought to the table and the servers will bring you the food.   I don't know about the other reviewers on here but we got friendly servers and they offer excellent recommendations since we are new to this bistro.   Pizza was delicious!  Way better than Pizza Pizza and Pizza Hut. Pasta was super hearty!    With all of my restaurant reviews, I always end it by saying will we come back?  The answers is yes and I'm glad this bistro is close by my home.   Food:  5/5 Ambience:  4/5 Service:  5/5 Cleanliness:  4/5"}
{"text":"What happened? We visited there a year ago when we were and Canada and yesterday we went there again.  Huge difference since the last time.   First the cashier/food runner has zero personality and has no idea what customer service looks like. When she brought out our food she slammed my sons pizza so hard on the table that the pizza slid off if it to the table. Any apology? No. She just left the food and walked off. She never once came by, even after walking past us several times, to ask if we needed anything.   Now the food my pasta was just ok. It was very oily and lacked any seasoning. My sons pizza wasn't cooked all the way.   Sadly, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick dinner on a Friday, not knowing much about the place. Was pleasantly surprised- the food was fresh and fast, reasonably priced and quite tasty. I got the carbonara, which was just the right amount of sauce to pasta  but the salads and pizza also looked good- will try those on the next visit.  I recommend coming, especially if you want something quick and tasty and not \"fast food\" grease box. My meal and drink was $17 and I was in and out in less than half hour."}
{"text":"Wow... what a refreshing gem in Beltline's West-End!  AND THEY HAVE PARKING!!!!  No need to scour the city streets for available parking.  They have a private parking lot behind the building.  I've never seen their lot full but if it is there is ample street parking in the neighbouring blocks.  It's a cafeteria style dining situation, you pick a place to sit, or if you know what you want just grab a menu and order away at the counter.  Once you've ordered and paid they give you a number to put on your table.  A few quick minutes later your food is delivered.  The location was an old Phil's diner which has since moved onto 11th Ave SW.  The place has been renovated to be relaxing and unpretentious.  There are a bunch of high tables with bar chairs for larger parties and regular tables for those that want a more intimate dining experience.  Via Cibo has some great lunch specials as well as Saturday and Sunday brunch till 2pm (or it could have been 3pm, not sure).  My mom uses a wheelchair and so it was great to see the place was well suited for those with limited mobility.  They have separate private stalled washrooms with ample space for wheelchairs.  The staff at this location was very helpful and very polite.  They even gave us a dessert to sample which was quite nice of them.  The food is quite good and I like the open-kitchen concept which gives you an extra feeling that your food is prepared well.  I had the lemon, blueberry ricotta pancakes.  It was good but I thought it could use a bit more ricotta and be a bit fluffier.  All in all, a great place to go for families, large groups or even just couples.  Too often I see restaurants in Calgary pop up and be the trendiest thing that week so they can charge $30 for artisian-hipster food.  I wish more restaurants in Calgary would adopt a similar approach to Via Cibo of offering great meals, great service with a casual, unpretentious atmosphere. We'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"I came to via Cibo for brunch on a Saturday with some friends. It's a pretty limited menu for brunch, I think there were maybe 8 options; these included french toasts with pecan crusts/Nutella etc., frittatas, eggs benedict - all in Italian style. I had the blueberry lemon ricotta pancakes. My friend had a frittata. The blueberry pancakes were delicious and not too sweet. I really enjoyed it and the portion size was perfect. My friend had the frittata and was also tasty. In total with a cappuccino my bill was $20.35 which for me is steep for the service and amount of food.   The way that this establishment works is that you order/pay at the front and seat yourself. The food is then brought to you. There was a patio with some seating and more inside.   Overall, a good experience and I would consider returning."}
{"text":"If you've been to the location in Deerfoot Meadows you can basically expect the same thing here. You line up and order, get a number, then they bring your order out to you.   Things are obviously a little crazy here having just opened but they have a ton of staff pumping the orders out. Just prepare for a little bit of a longer wait. The atmosphere is a little noisier here too as it's more families coming to dine.  For the food, they have the same menu options as elsewhere and the same high quality coming out of the kitchen. It's nice to have a slightly closer location to home than DFM so maybe I'll get here a little more often."}
{"text":"Via Cibo serves solid rustic Italian fare.   Love their daily specials since I am always on a budget.  The Tuesday $8 pasta dish really satisfy my carb craving. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  $8 pizza Wednesday?! I am in!  I am also eyeing that Bombalinos with Nutella please."}
{"text":"Italian street food! Nom! Via Cibo serves comforting Italian meals at a somewhat affordable price. It's similar to Chipotle with an Italian flare.   Via = Street  | Cibo = Food  We ordered three items from the \"all-day\" menu.   Cavolo ($5 as a side)  The highlight of our meal was the insalate! Bright Tuscan Kale, with Lemon Ricotta, Olives, Fennel, sweet Cipollini Onions, acidic White Balsamic Citrus Vinaigrette! It was a perfectly balanced dish!   Pasta Al Pesto ($12.00)  Your choice of linguine or penne with Basil Pesto, tossed with Arugula, Sundried Tomatoes with Shaved Grana Padano Cheese! The flavor profile of this dish was great - a hint of bitterness from the arugula, freshness from the basil pesto and sweetness from the sundried tomatoes. It was delightful dish. My only concern was the amount of oil in the dish as the pasta was drenching in oil.   Via Casalinga ($14.00) The Via Caslinga pizza consists of Tomato, Casalinga Salami, Sausage, Fior Di Latte and Ricotta Cheese. Another delicious dish from Via Cibo! Again, a very composed dish but slightly on the heavier side. I was full after half a slice. The crust did not hold up well. Perhaps it was steam from the plate restricting it from escaping. The pizza lost the crispness it had. A light char may have enhanced the flavor and texture to the dish.    Overall, we were content with Via Cibo!   Via Cibo + Pancia  = Felice = Happy belly!"}
{"text":"The pizza is rustic style and so tasty, loved the crust. We also shared a salad and it was also very nice. A bit pricey but overall a great dining experience and the staff were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for dinner one night and firstly id like to say this place reminded me of Williams Coffee Cafe. Don't get me wrong that isn't a bad thing.. I really enjoyed how the set up was. Made me feel as though I was in a fast food joint but had the elegance of service at the table. My friend ordered \"Steak All Italian\" and I ordered the \"Pollo Balsamico\" we shared a side \"Tuscan Fries\" and 1/2 liter of their finest vino We both enjoyed our meal very much, they were extremely tasty and we found the sandwich to be a huge size. The waiters were quick in collecting our plates and didn't make me feel rushed in anyway.   The set up was.. you walk in and look at the board then order, they give you a number, you proceed through the line to the cashier to pay. Once you pay you sit down with your number and you wait to be served. We didn't have to wait overly long for our meal.   I really enjoyed my experience here and most likely will return."}
{"text":"Great concept, its restaurant quality food at a more affordable price.  You go up to the counter and order your food from an extensive menu and get a number for your table.  Shortly after a server arrives with your food.  I had the arugula salad( you can add chicken or seared tuna)  which was lacking acidity in the dressing but they were more than happy to rectify that with a dressing more to my taste.  I tried the tonino  which was delicious.  its like a flat bread, but it is called a piadina and its filled with seared tuna, arugula tomatoes,olive and white bean spread.  The piadinas r made on their premisies with their own machine. The categories of food are as follows: Insalata, gourmet salads \"Na Pizza  with plain to gourmet toppings Pasta with gourmet and basic sauces Piadina ( Italian flat bread) with several varieties like  grilled chicken, seared tuna, Calabrese sausages, prosciutto, portobello mushroom and goat  Panini (sandwiches) from braised veal, steak, chcken to meat balls Sides are salads, seared broccolini( rapini),marinated olives, and tuscan fries seasoned with sea salt, truffle oil and shaved Grana Padano Cheese    Ok Stop Salivating and Go eat here!"}
{"text":"I went to this place on the weekend, the staff is friendly and the food is good.  You pay first, sit down and get your order in a decent amount of time.  I had the Osso buco sandwich and fries, both taste fresh and good.  I recommend."}
{"text":"3.75/5 - yeah I'm specific.  The concept of this place is like Famoso - you go in, place your order at the counter, pay, then take a seat and your food will be served to you. Compared to other places with the same concept, Via Cibo actually looks pretty upscale casual! Good menu selection as well with dishes in the $10~$15 range, I love that they have a brunch menu for the weekends!   Tried a bunch of things here but the Via Poutine is probably my fav - it's topped with ossobuco! The pizzas were disappointing due to a chewy crust. You can skip the Tiramisu French Toast too despite other rave reviews - the dollop of mascarpone was too watery and tasteless - just tasted like any other cinnamon french toast. The gnocchi was worth trying though, beautiful presentation but was odded out by the accompanied dinner roll (you don't see that in Italy!). The gnocchi tasted good but would've been a lot better had the pieces been a little smaller and cooked to al dente (can you tell I'm super picky about my pastas?).  Though Via Cibo states that it serves up authentic Italian street food, I wouldn't believe that saying at all. Via Cibo is more of an Americanized version that tries quite well at mimicing Italian dishes, but don't expect to be transported back to the streets of Rome here. I would recommend you try this place for a casual lunch!"}
{"text":"I dropped by Via Cibo for dinner last weekend since I was craving Italian. We ordered the Prosciutto Arugula Pizza ($15) which was just ok. The crust was thin which is normally a good thing but not when it gets so soggy that it starts to fall apart. Part of the sogginess could be attributed to the tomato sauce which was really watery. The prosciutto was thinly sliced but could have been more flavourful. The arugula lacked some of the spiciness I've come to expect. The roasted tomatoes added a nice sweetness to the pizza but the seeds were not removed and the juice just added to the sogginess of the crust. I didn't notice any Fiore di latte mozzarella in the pizza but the parmesan did add some flavour. I also would have liked a little more balsamic glaze. All in all, the flavour of the pizza was ok, however, the sogginess of the crust really brought it down to another level.  The Poutine with Bolognese ($9) was probably the best dish of the night. The fries were just ok (not crispy enough) but there were lots of cheese curds and the  bolognese sauce had a good amount of ground beef in a flavorful tomato sauce.  The Gnocchi Gorgonzola ($15) on the other hand was disappointing. On first bite, the gorgonzola cream sauce was really tasty and creamy. However, after a few more bites, it was apparent that the sauce had much more of a garlic flavour than gorgonzola. I also found the sauce extremely rich (probably too much butter). Pancetta, roasted tomatoes green onion and parmasean were also in the dish but their flavours were muted by the overpowering cream sauce. The gnocchi was a little on the heavier side and I found it stuck to my teeth a bit as I was chewing it. Not the best dish in my opinion.  Via Cibo is one of those cafeteria style restaurants where you order at the counter and then the dishes are brought out to your table. When I went up to ask if I was at the right counter, the girl looked at me with no smile and said, \"It'll be at least a 30 minute wait (with an emphasis on the\" least\") and then told me I was to order at the register to the right. I was a little taken aback as it seemed she really didn't want me to order and the unsaid message I heard was \"eat somewhere else\". I decided to stay nonetheless. The cashier who took my order was friendly and really nice though. I've eaten here before and it was good from what I can remember. Hopefully this was just an anomaly since they were so busy tonight."}
{"text":"Well . . . .   Can't recommend the pizza. After placing our order we think they lost it. . . It took at least 20 minutes for our pizza to arrive, and it wasn't busy at the time.  The toppings were tasty but sparse. The crust was horrible, soggy and limp. More like wet paper and flavorless.   The girl that took our order was great and is wasting her time at a fast food place. Can't say we will be back, although I hear the pasta is good but in my opinion everything is far too expensive for this type of place."}
{"text":"My friend told me that many Italian restaurants generally put just enough sauce to coat the pasta.  Well, this is definitely the case at Via Cibo Street Food.  Before i dive into my food talk, i want to layout the scene.  It's cafeteria style where you line up to order.  The menu hangs above at the background for you to browse and pick.  There is a section that announces the special of the day.  For Tuesday night, it was $8 for pasta.  The thing is, it literally means just the pasta.  Everything meat and veggies are extra mula.  So with this in mind, i didn't bother with the hassle of dealing with the dinner special.  I decided on Broccolini & Sausage with Penne ($15.99 +tax).  It has broccolini, handmade italian sausage, spicy chili garlic olive oil, and grana padano cheese.  Light on the sauce and not much italian sausage.  I asked for more sauce but the dish came back looking exactly like the same amount of sauce as the first time.  I mainly tasted the dough of the pasta.  Oh well.  At least the red wine was good."}
{"text":"I called in a takeaway order...and drive to their location to pick it up. When I got there they told me that they didn't have my order !  I was tired and starving so we waited there another 20 mins for them to make our order. While they offered me a discount...the food was not good and obviously rushed. I would not eat here again- even if it was free."}
{"text":"This place is packed during a weekday or weekend lunch hour, but they manage to work with the crowds quite efficiently while still maintaining service and positivity.   Standard sandwiches, pastas, and pizzas that aren't fantastic, but are a nice lunch when considering the other choices in Deerfoot Meadows.   I had a prosciutto and arugula flatbread wrap, it was lacking in flavour, and a bit chintzy on the toppings and meat, but again it was fresh and different than typical fast food."}
