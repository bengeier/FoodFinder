{"text":"This was my first visit for my husband and I. The decor was nice. We had a friendly waitress. She was very informative about the menu. We ordered the Calamari and poke for apps. The calamari was crispy and hot. The poke was good. For dinner I ordered the oyster po boy and it was too salty and the bread was a little too charred for my liking. My husband ordered the gumbo ramen and the flavors did not go well with his taste. For dessert we had the beignets, they were ok."}
{"text":"Definitely a good experience, especially considering they have been opened for a handful of days.  Staff is trying very hard to be super nice but not coming across fake.  Décor is about the same layout as al lthe way back to Vinnie's days but definitely feels like a brand new place and not too overdone.  Service was great. Our server, Morgan, was super friendly and quick to visit the table.  Food was good. We had the calamari appetizer which had a bit of a buttery sweetness to it.  Most of us ordered their signature plate which was the seafood bowl. You pick a sauce, then a seafood, and a heat level.  at the table we had shrimp and crawfish. Both were good but the serving took a bit to figure out. The plates come in this large bowls with the seafood, potatoes, sausage, but then there is this bowl with the flavored sauce on the side. We were not sure if we were supposed to pour it over or just dip the food in it.  I tried the seafood without the sauce and it felt that it needed a bit more 'salt' in the preparation but that may be just my taste.  Overall the plate was good when it was all combined.  We were not super sure what the Asian-Cajun flavors were though. We saw sushi and ramen noodles on the menu but we stuck with the more seafood-Cajun items.  Overall good visit and we would come back."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was great. Loved the music playing in the background. The dirty rice was a tasteful start to a delicious meal. The clam and shrimp boils hit the spot. Need to go back and try some more of the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome management!!! Highly recommend!! Margaret and Jess were so accommodating !! 5 Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is sooo awesome! Great food and such a fun environment... I love hanging out at the bar and I have to brag on one of the bartenders who has made my experiences there even better. His name was Trevor woods I believe, and he is a super friendly and personable guy. He always has a smile on his face, and even when things are busy he keeps a smile and friendly personality. Keep bringing people like Trevor in as bartenders, and you'll keep doing well with business!"}
{"text":"It was ok...nothing to write home about. Presentation of the food was much better than it tasted. We had the calamari, gator balls and crab legs. They were average although I will say the crab legs were of good quality.  Cool looking place and menu but it wasn't as good as I had hoped...may go back someday but it was just ok."}
{"text":"Awesome meal and super affordable!! Amanda was knowledgeable and personable!! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My experience was good, but don't forget your wallet. We ordered several items on the menu including a shrimp boil - but the \"sushi\" was the best thing we had. I absolutely love it and would come again just for that. The cocktails were unexpected and fun. The service was good but very slow - and we sat right in front of the kitchen door. The atmosphere is wonderful, the design is funky and eclectic. The price is a bit much for what you get, but my food was so good - I didn't mind. In the immortal words of the terminator, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Me and the hubby checked out Wu's on a Thursday evening and really enjoyed our meal!  My cocktails were another story.  We started with the Cajun Fried Crab Roll, which was really good. We didn't have any chopsticks and our server didn't come back before we devoured all 8 pieces. Lol For my entree I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich. It was crispy, juicy and tasty! The slaw was just enough. Hubby got the Snow Crab Boil - it's not like the ones served in a plastic bag all mixed in with the seasoning sauce, corn and potatoes (Hot n Juicy) but it was still pretty good. We also shared an order of the Cajun Gumbo that had crawfish and sausage in it, what a great combo! 

Hubby was satisfied with his beers but my Mai Tai had to be sent back for a Titos and soda because it tasted like a sweet Kidy Cocktail filled with cherry syrup. The lychee drink is also a miss. Filled past the top with crushed ice and served with a piece of rotting fruit."}
{"text":"Decided to ignore the offensive stereotypical and non-sensical Asian-mongering theme to try the food.

The Good: Signature cauliflower was good and portion was generous.

The Bad: Gumbo ramen was odd - the thick roux combined with noodles just didn't work both in terms of texture and taste. Their housemade ramen was very doughy. Tuna poke was not bad but way too salty. Servers wear T-shirts with random Chinese words (i.e. luck, peace, love, beautiful) which I find absurd - but not more so than the Confucius mural and Chinese decor next to a life-sized alligator.

Verdict: I am wiling to give it one more shot. The restaurant looks busy but I think it's because it caters to a clientele that appreciates gimmick more than substance."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here. We ordered the Cajun cauliflower, BBQ shrimp, alligator roll. All were tasty, will come back to try other selections."}
{"text":"The nibbles plates are tasty and good for sharing. Tried the tuna roll, kung pao cauliflower, gator balls, and would do these again. Wouldn't try their specialty ramen again, just wasnt my taste. The drinks are good. Service was friendly and fast on a Friday night."}
{"text":"We saw the high yelp ratings and decided to be brave. The menu was very limited so we got one of the boils and calamari, specifically 1lb of mussels. Calamari tasted decent, but the size was ridiculously miniscule for freaking 11 bucks (it was worth a third of the price). The main dish, the mussels, was even worse value for its price ($20!) and tasted very bland. Literally Red Lobster mussels taste 5x better for half the price. The whole bill was around $40, which you'd assume would be a decent meal for 2, but neither of us was remotely full, so we decided to go to some fast food place afterwards. Maybe all the money goes to getting Hooters wannabe waitresses. We will gladly never come back to this massive disappointment of a place ever again."}
{"text":"Where should I begin? Maybe that this is definitely NOT the place to take your girlfriend's Taiwanese mother with whom you are meeting for the first time.  

From the outside the restaurant looked promising, although parking was limited, despite not being very busy.  **If you can't find parking, I would recommend trying the lot across the street from Rite Aid.**  The inside decor was nice, but it left me confused as to what type of atmosphere they were trying to create.  

What I (we) ordered:  
Kung Pao Cauliflower -  The ONLY thing that we all enjoyed
Raw Oysters - I've had less sand in my mouth after face-planting on the beach
BBQ Shrimp - I don't mind taking the shell off the tail, but the legs too??  Pass....
Dirty Rice - NOPE
Grilled Scallion Noodles - If a look on someone's face could completely embody a subpar yelp review, it was the look my girlfriend's mother gave me after these were delivered to our table.  In all fairness, the look she gave could've also been due to her disapproval of her daughter's choice in men, but I remain hopeful that it was the noodles!

Lastly - my girlfriend ordered a glass of wine and it came in a dirty glass.   This isn't a big deal.  Things slip through the cracks.  But when we brought this to their attention (when I say \"we\", I of course mean her), they literally brought back the same glass with an obvious attempt of just wiping it down instead of giving her a new glass.  Come on now!  

All-in-all, it must have been a very memorable night, since my girlfriend's mother didn't stop complaining about it during her entire visit to Charlotte.  Thanks, Wu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!!! My office is close by so having lunch here has quickly become a new favorite!!!  From the moment you walk in the dining experience is awesome, make sure you give it a taste!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Wu's for the first time this weekend but it won't be the last. The waitress was very helpful with her recommendations, and the food came out pretty quickly considering it's a brand new restaurant. 

I wasn't sure how the New Orleans fare would mix with Asian cuisine, but they did a fantastic job marrying the 2 together. My favorite course was a toss up between the fried Gator balls, and the fried Gator roll, but it was all really, really good."}
{"text":"Loved it.  Food was good.  We had Tuna Poke, gator roll, Kung pao cauliflower, bread pudding .  Lively atmosphere and great service. Will be back."}
{"text":"Had great service even though it just recently opened. We got the crawfish boil with wu seasoning, which probably could be split between two people. Seasoning was awesome!

You also HAVE to get the fried cauliflower! Was tempted to order seconds on that. 

Also had the beignets and bread pudding. Would really recommend anything we ordered. Can't wait to go back and try more off of the menu!"}
{"text":"According to Yelp this place is open until 2:00am which is incorrect. Showed up at 10:40pm and it was closed. Very Disappointed !"}
{"text":"Where Nan and Byron's used to be."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time coming to wu's. The first time was when it first opened. And that experience wasn't great either. But we figured we would wait until they got the new restaurant kinks out. Today the service was terrible. The bartender was our waiter. She barely stopped at our table to take our order. It took forever for our food to come out. And the BBQ SHRIMP was definitely old and stale. The stench that came off of it was terrible. Needless to say we will not be back."}
{"text":"To start, our waitress was AMAZING. Ashley was attentive & explained the menu thoroughly. She was social & engaged with her customers. She's a 6/5!!  but the reason why I'd give this restaurant a 3/5 was food. My boyfriend loved everything but I personally wasn't a fan. For \"nibbles\" we got rice tuna poke, which was awesome! 4/5. My boyfriend got chicken curry noodle dish which I'd give 2.5/5. I got kale salad. I learned today that I do not like kale. Something about this dish wasn't great. The texture wasn't there. I'd give it a 1/5. But they have amazing drink choices!! I wish I could've tried them all. But anyways, huge shout out to our server, Ashley. You were awesome!"}
{"text":"Went with my boyfriend for the first time tonight and we were absolutely blown away! Several of our friends had told us about Wu's and their awesome take on Cajun but this place totally exceeded our expectations. Super cool atmosphere with a really fun vibe, the front looks like you're about to walk into a hot spot in LA. I loved it. And I loved that they played authentic New Orleans upbeat jazz the entire time. We were seated immediately and our server was prompt, bringing us water almost as soon as we sat down. She was so sweet, super helpful in explaining the menu, and an expert on the food! We had peeked at the menu beforehand and had an idea of what we wanted, but then once she made her recommendations, we ordered completely different things. And I'm so glad we did! The menu itself is an awesome concept. I've lived in charlotte for over 2 years and have never heard of any restaurant serving a low country boil, making this restaurant totally unique. We got the gator balls, the gumbo ramen, the cold tuna poke bowl, and the Cajun crab roll. The gator balls were pretty good, definitely Cajun flavor, and the Tasso ham gravy that came on top was so good. We'd probably skip these next time, but that doesn't mean they weren't tasty! I'd just want to explore more of the app menu on our next visit. next came the Cajun crab roll, YALL THIS WAS AMAZING. I could've easily eaten 4 more. Good portion size too with 8 large pieces. I literally almost licked the plate clean. Whatever the \"money sauce\" has in it, it's working YUM! As soon as we finished our last bite, our ramen bowls came. I was excited but kind of nervous about the idea of gumbo and ramen but it was DELICIOUS! Such a cool combination and the flavor was off the chain. The sausage and crawfish were fresh and plentiful and the gumbo base itself was rich and creamy but not heavy, and had just the right amount of spice. I loved every single bite. Our cold poke bowl was also wonderful! The ratio of tuna to noodles was almost triple, I was so impressed because most restaurants skimp on seafood especially fish. It was fresh, super flavorful, and unique. Plus the cilantro puts it over the top good! I'd absolutely get both again! Hats off to this place for being awesome in every category. Amazing food, awesome atmosphere, and quick, friendly, and knowledgeable service. Our waitress was fabulous and so sweet, and checked in on us every step without being overbearing. Loved our first visit to Wu's. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, and very quick. Cajun Boils are the way to go. Very family friendly."}
{"text":"We read the other reviews before going about the service. Although it wasn't bad as some other people's experiences it really wasn't great. Drinks took a while to get to the table and when we ordered another round mine was completely forgotten until I was later notified that they were out of the vodka I wanted for my drink. I found it strange I was just waiting around without someone telling me.  My husband was given his can of beer without a glass. We asked for a glass and it came out warm. Like, just washed warm. I don't know anyone who puts a cold beer in a warm glass. 

The food was pretty good. The barbecue shrimp is definitely a highlight. The flavors were perfect and the bread for dipping was an added bonus. The boil I got was good, plenty of mussels. Husband says his gumbo ramen was ok; portion was perfect but it was an odd combination flavor wise. Would have received 3 1/2 stars if I could and 4 if we had better service."}
{"text":"this place is SO overpriced and the food tastes like....um poo? 

i don't even know how it stays in business. got the ramen and it was cold and seriously so bad i couldn't finish it. Also the seafood has no seasoning on it. and they charge you for extra sauce, which is made of nothing but oil and garlic. if you enjoy spending a ton of money and feeling like you totally got scammed then i guess this place is not bad lol."}
{"text":"Wow! My husband and I had a fantastic date night here!

We started with the lychee cocktail and their Old Fashioned. I really enjoyed the lychee one, it was light and refreshing. Perfect for summer.

We had the kung Pao cauliflower for an appetizer and it was packed with flavor and absolutely delicious! It was a very generous portion too. 

We shared the snow crab boil and it was plenty for us both! It was really good and flavorful and such a fun dish to eat. It came with potatoes, corn and sausage as well. 

We ended our meal with the beignets which were piping hot, and light and fluffy. 
Everything we had was delicious and it was such a fun meal!

Our service was excellent and the atmosphere was fun too. It's casual but still nice. What a great find! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Been to Wu's twice. First time the food was up and down. Shrimp toast is pretty good. Gumbo ramen and gator sushi I won't order again. 
The second time we had some friends want to try Wu's because the Korean bbq place was closed nearby. Had to send back some food that was burned badly and the service was bad. Had an overcharge for a drink on the check as well. Friends were not impressed either. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Found this awesome restaurant in Charlotte. Stopped in for lunch and had the calamari po' boy. It was amazing! They have a great menu and nice fresh seafood choices. Fresh oysters, crab legs, lobster and more! Atmosphere was relaxing and fresh."}
{"text":"It was our first time here, and we both ordered the pork belly noodle ramen. There was no broth in the soup at all, it was all noodles. Our server tamra never checked on us. 1 star for bad food and service"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Hoping I just had a bad experience but the food just was not good. The seafood was not flavorful and a little over cooked. Was expecting some big Cajun flavors and didn't really get any of that."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is electric. Love the music playing in the background. However the food is mediocre at best. I really wasn't wowed by what I got. I had their shrimp toast and curry chicken ramen bowl. I can go for awhile before I come back."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a great price. Had the crawfish & rice bowl. Awesome dish & must try the ol fashion drink"}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and I'm disappointed with the two dishes that I ordered. The Wu Cajun gumbo was way too salty. I decided to order the tuna ramen bowl to replace it. It's pretty tasty, but thr homemade ramen was overlooked and too soft.  The only thing that I like there is their beignets for desserts. They are soft, puffy and not too greasy."}
{"text":"Was really excited to try out this place as we are huge fans of Cajun food. But we ended up very disappointed. Showed up around 9 o clock on a Friday (1/12/18) to a not very busy crowd inside the restaurant. The manager on duty and our waitress were incredibly welcoming and hospitable, so there was nothing wrong with the actual service. Ordered around 9:15, received our appetizer relatively quickly which was the best part of the meal.  You could see something going wrong in the kitchen as waitresses were continually coming out cursing or frustrated. We ended up waiting 40 minutes for our food, including our three year old daughters food. We weren't so upset about the wait bc sometimes shit happens in the back and we understand, but our main courses were not so great. I got a shrimp boil that came in a bowl of seasoned water basically, and my potatoes were undercooked. My girlfriend got the spicy chicken and rice, but the chicken was completely unseasoned, not even salt or pepper! My friend ordered the pork belly dish and the fat hadn't even been rendered on the pork belly. I'm not sure what's going on in the kitchen there, but it needs to be changed. Huge let down guys."}
{"text":"Just arrived in North Carolina and Wu's Cajun Sea food was our first stop. We were seated right away, our waitress Lourdes was very friendly. We ordered some boudin gator balls but they were out so we preceded with the buttermilk calamari. It was ok. The lemony sauce gave it a touch. We decided on a tuna poke which they were also out. We ended up getting the pork belly noodles and the General Wu's grilled chicken bowl. The pork belly noodles were awful. Very low in salt and there was too many noodles. The General Wu's grilled chicken bowl was somewhat good not to impress. I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"I'm usually skeptical for new restaurants the pop up in locations that never seem to do well. It seems this location has been a revolving door for some other businesses to crash, however, I was really impressed with Wu's. So much so, that I hope that it continues to thrive, so I can frequent this spot. I absolutely loved the Calamari Po'Boy with the street corn. It was so delicious! Everything had so much flavor and the calamari was cooked perfect, not too hard or chewy.

Not only was the food amazing, but our server and all of the staff were extremely attentive and welcoming. When several of my co-workers mentioned allergies, our waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and had great recommendations. I cannot say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"I've been to Wu's twice now.  Both time the food was good and I did enjoy it.  The reason for the lower star rating...the service, specifically on my second visit.

Both times I went were for early week night dinners so we were seated right away.  The second time my husband and I waited for a very long time while no one ever came to the table.  Just as we were going to go ask the hostess if we had a server as I was watching a group of 3 servers just stand around I see one look at us and say to the others \"oh, that's my table.\"  So then she finally came over with no apology for the long wait.  Unfortunately this didn't get us off to a great start but that's ok..on to the dinner!

We shared several things:  street corn, broccoli, BBQ shrimp and gumbo.  I had these same items minus the gumbo on my first visit.  Unfortunately one side of the street corn was completely burnt (not charred) so we couldn't eat it all.  Everything else was tasty, in particular the BBQ shrimp.  I joked to my husband you would not want to eat that on a first date. I had to ask for a bowl to put our shells in w/ the BBQ shrimp and our waitress acted like that was odd, but the first time I went this was brought out at the start.  It is very messy but worth it-so good! On my first visit I also had the beignets which were delish!

On my second visit we were brought the check and we didn't want to touch anything with our messy BBQ shrimp hands.  The first time I visited we were brought hot towels and lemons.  We had all commented how nice that was and so great with the messy food.  The second visit I asked the waitress if we were going to get the hot towel.  SHe said that the towels were out to the laundry so they were only giving them out if asked.  I thought this was really not a win....they shouldn't do something part of the time and have customers come to expect it.  Espeically when it is a very nice touch to have at the end of a messy meal.  

The mediocre service really brought down the experience as a whole.  The BBQ shrimp is a winner though!"}
{"text":"Had the fired chicken sandwich and the dirt rice. Was very happy with both. The tuna poke was ordered by my friend  and I love it. Will be back. It was packed for lunch on a Friday. I can see a great lounge vibe for the evening. Maybe they will add some evening music."}
{"text":"Dropped in one evening for dinner and the place was packed. OK cool no problem we will wait. Even though they were busy our server was very attentive. The food was good. The sauce could have been a little thicker. Little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Love this place The Manager Jessica Was so Nice And friendly! Katie The Bartender Was Great Too ! The Food Was To Die For We Really Really Had A Great Time ! Must Try Wu's !"}
{"text":"I took my friend here for a late birthday lunch. We both were excited to try this place out. After reading previous reviews we were excited there was no wait time to be seated. When our server came (I'll use initials only) TJ she started out great and it went downhill.. she welcomed us warmly took our drink orders and walked away. When she returned she asked if we had any questions about the menu \"of course we do, we've never been here\" she only responded to what we asked. She didn't give any suggestions .. no problem.. she left came back and asked \"Are you ready? Can we get it going, I have another table I need to go greet!\" My friend and I looked at each other and both said did she just say that out loud. Get this visual several tables were empty. I started to watch this server I am not certain if they have one server for an area or if it's a group effort here. They should work on it because she was in the patio area, in the front just everywhere!  Food comes.. I had oysters one of the shells had almost nothing in it..really who shucked these.. she hyped everything up as \"to die for\" my friend asked about her sushi roll and she said ooh it takes the longest to make. You'd think this would be something you would tell someone while ordering .. oh this takes a little while to prepare just so you're aware. We only spoke to the manager due to the table next to us who was there before us and we got our food before them. She tried to redeem herself after we spoke with the manager .. training on service is a must here.. can't say I'd be back."}
{"text":"Went to Wu's on Saturday night, September 23rd and Im still upset about wasting 63.00.  The calamari appetizer was waaaay too salty. When the waitress came by to see how we were doing, I did inform her and she offered to send it back but I didn't want to seem like a complainer so my boyfriend and I continued to eat it.  We were in desperate need of lemon juice to cut the salt.  I ordered the fried rice with crawfish and it was tasteless.  The salt was non existent in that dish and the rice was completely OVERcooked and mushy. Its weird too because I was trying to figure out why my overcooked rice had pieces of crunchy undercooked rice in it and was baffled for some time until realized they put peanuts in the dish.  They really shouldn't do that because its quite confusing and those nuts add no value whatsoever to that dish except but to leave you wondering how its under/overcooked at the same time.  The oysters were pretty good but I guess because those didn't require anyones intervention too much. Our waitress was very nice and so was the atmosphere so even though we didn't enjoy our meals, we still made sure to tip her fairly."}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment.. I was feeling pretty under the weather today and was really craving some ramen. After reading through some yelp reviews, I decided to give this place a try. I was so upset when I got home and opened up the container. It was literally dried up mushy noodles with a few pieces of sausage and shrimp, no broth whatsoever and a ton of chili peppers. After forcing myself to take a bite, I realized that the ramen broth and noodles were solidified together (sitting out for a very long time). I could no longer manage to get the rest of it down and ended up having to go get my dinner at Harris Teeter. I really thought this place was going to be great but it was such a let down..."}
{"text":"Amazing food, service and atmosphere! So happy to have a new restaurant with a little flare. 

We got the fried cauliflower, shrimp boil, tuna poke wantons and gumbo ramen. Everything was served in large portions, and tasted amazing! The boil is definitely big enough for two people. 

Highly recommend trying this place!"}
{"text":"This was awesome!! Awesome service, nicely strong drinks, quick food turnaround. First time going but not the last. Awesome Kung pow cauliflower"}
{"text":"I sadly have to change my review of Wu's. I came back to enjoy a meal at Wu's Saturday morning as they now offer brunch.  I was hungry and excited to see what Cajun spin on brunch was on the menu. When we arrived however, the sanitation score was a very low at 92 which means many violations were present. I do not recommend eating at a place where the sanitation score is that low in general but in particular a place that serves primarily seafood, some of which is raw. There is a chance these items are not stored at the right temperatures, cross contamination, all sorts of problems from a score that low. I turned around and never even had a chance to see a menu. Very sad!"}
{"text":"Wow. 

I'm really impressed with this place. Everything about this place was sooooo good. 

No, scratch that. Everything about this place was a-m-a-z-i-n-g.  

Now, I can't lie I'm a bit of a skeptic when it comes to \"hot new businesses\". I want to love them. But there have been times where I've been fooled by the new places and they didn't live up to the hype. 

But guys, just know that this place absolutely lives up to the hype! 

We ordered from all over the menu and each dish was delicious. I don't have favorites because I enjoyed everything so much that I'd go back and order everything I had again!  

So I'll just list everything I tried:

Buttermilk Fried Calamari
BBQ Shrimp
Street Corn
Shrimp Boil with Fresh Jerk seasoning (not as spicy as you'd think - very good) 
Grilled Scallion Noodles
Sangria

Get it all. Trust me. You WILL NOT regret it. 

But...do you know what else I love about this place? I love that there are so many other things that I still want to try here. For me, that's worth all 5 stars. I loved everything that I had and I already know without a doubt that whatever I try next will be delicious. 

You can tell by now that I'm a fan. I'm sure this will be a regular spot for me. I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal.  

Welcome Wu's! I'm glad you're here!"}
{"text":"Okay. Asian cuisine. Creole/Southern cuisine. Put them together and you have a wonderful masterpiece if you appreciate a creative fusion. This is definitely my new favorite restaurant.  Gumbo ramen, calamari po' boys, gator rolls (like sushi rolls but with fried gator) are all things that someone like me could only dream of. Wu's is a place where someone who has an obsession with both Asian and Cajun food can come to and experience pure joy. I sound like I'm raving but I really just think that a place like this is a unique find that I thoroughly enjoyed. I have to get back there soon."}
{"text":"Service was great, drinks were on point (I had the sake sangria), but food was terrible. I give them an A for effort for putting the idea of Asian + Cajun food together, but it was not good in terms of taste. I had the chicken curry noodles--the grilled chicken was burnt and the bowl came in a very small portion. The other food that my friends ordered also came in small portions--just a chicken sandwich for $8, two small lobster tails for $32, you get the point. The beignets was a good attempt, but nothing compared to New Orleans. I would visit again, but just for the drinks."}
{"text":"Meh. That's really the cliff note for Wu's. 

We had a office lunch here and generally we were not planning to make it a habit, half of us turned down the frequent dinner card. The fusion idea works but it's not really the best or should be recreated by another restaurant. 

I had the gumbo ramen. The meal was prepared quickly and came out hot. The flavors worked but the portion was small for a lunch and I think the dinner menu is the same. There was a shaker of some sort of spice blend in the table and everyone reached for it. No one could tell what the spice blend was but just that the meals needed something. The entire table has been to New Orleans so maybe our bar was too high. The boil seemed like the best option on the menu but it was pricy and it doesn't really work for lunch. 

The atmosphere was also a strange fusion. Loud music, sports on TVs, and the red and black of a Chinese restaurant blended together for a weird feel. It might be better for a happy hour or pre dinner drink since the bar had an impressive display. 

Again it was Meh.... worth a try but not worth going back."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. I had clams. One very bad clam in batch. Ugh.  Nice tasting food."}
{"text":"BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT YOU ORDER! There are 2 dishes- Crawfish FRIED rice and Crawfish AND rice. The FRIED had peanuts and the other doesn't! I asked for crawfish and rice but they gave me the fried rice. I ate some and gave my baby some but she's allergic to peanuts. THANKK GOODNESS she didn't have a reaction but that was SCARYYY!!! 
The peanuts were really hidden in the rice. I thought the rice was just undercooked but I asked my waitress why does my rice have this weird soft crunch. She told me there's peanuts in it and I freaked!! JUST BE CAREFUL YOU GUYS!!"}
{"text":"Good environment. Long wait for expensive, poorly made food. Very underwhelming. The servers were alright. Nothing special. I really wanted to like this place but it wasn't good"}
{"text":"Very good fusion food, great wait staff, friendly, eclectic menu.
Had Bouidn Gator Balls andPork Belly sandwich"}
{"text":"Tough start that was totally made up for by the absolutely delicious food and drinks. We walked in at 5 on a Friday night and were literally the only ones there. Took too long for us to get our drinks (I had blackened old fashioned that was fantastic, a little spicy, great flavor and wife ordered a beer they were out of), but once the food started coming to our table, we were very impressed. Kung Pao Cauliflower was excellent, had some spice to it. Shared the wedge salad and kale salad, both very tasty and nice size for the price. Had the tuna roll, which was not quite terrific, but still very good. Then had an apple egg roll for dessert, which was tasty if a little pedestrian. Overall, food was very good, service started slow but picked up. Would return for the food, especially that Kung Pao Cauliflower!"}
{"text":"Great food great times we really enjoyed it will definitely go back I got the Ramen and I really  enjoy that the drinks were outstanding have a lot of spice to them and were strong enough that I did want another one"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out with some friends and I have to admit that I was terribly disappointed. I think the majority of the food was not that flavorful and lacked that punch to bring me back. 

We tried the gator balls, tuna poke, crawfish fried rice, calamari and fried cauliflower for the apps. The tuna poke might've been the best one out of the bunch but it's still nothing to write home about in my opinion. 

My friends all got the gumbo ramen and mentioned that it wasn't what they expected and lacked flavor as well. I went with their boil with mussels and the Fresh Jerk seasoning. It came with a lb of mussels, 2 pieces of corn, 2 potatoes and one piece of sausage. 

Now, for the small amount of sauce in the bowl, it was decent but the mussels were still pretty dry. It felt like they sprinkled dry spices on before the seafood was cooked so while the shells had a rub on them, the insides were bland and lacked the flavor I expected from a boil. Also, I ordered the Fresh Jerk seasoning extra hot and it just wasn't good at all...

The prices aren't bad for southend and the service was okay. I always try to give new places benefit of the doubt when it comes to that but I don't think I'll be back. Blaze is right down the street and I can always go for some pizza!"}
{"text":"Spot on poke bowl, calamari, and house salad.  Poke flavor as good as Hawaiian poke!  Grilled Chicken on the salad was super fatty, but the manager took it off the bill which I appreciated."}
{"text":"Wu's is a great concept in a great location. What's keeping this review from being better is the service. We arrived to Wu's a little after 9 and were promptly seated.  The restaurant had a few customers dining but by no means was there a crowd. Fifteen minutes passed without a server coming to take our drink orders so finally we stopped a server and asked for them to send our waitress over. We were informed they just switched tables so that's where the confusion came in. 
We placed our drink orders and ordered appetizers and our main dish. It took a while for our drinks to come and then even longer for our food. Our appetizers never came out and our server told us there must have been a mix up in the back. 
The food we did receive (the shrimp boil and crab leg boil) was tasty and had great portions--everything is shareable. We're going to try again but we hope the service improves some."}
{"text":"Love this place! Who would have thought Cajun and Asian could be so good together??!! We enjoyed the broccoli and fried gator as a starter. Delicious! I had the lowcountry boil with shrimp in Wu's seasoning extra hot. It was. It was not spicy at all and I like spicy food. Luckily, Louisiana hot sauce is on the table. Add a few drops and perfect.  The portions are generous. I was stuffed. After I finished my boil, Alex brought a hot towel with two lemons to the table. Wow!  Nice touch. Alex is a great server and she was very helpful and spot on with her suggestions. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"These Cajun, seafood, boil spots seem to be growing in popularity. 

I am somewhat torn with Wu's, because I love the concept, I love the location, I love the interior and ambiance.  The asian-cajun fusion vibe they've cultivated oozes from every corner and crevice within Wu's. 

The food is good, not great.  Its not even that it doesn't taste good, I just don't think you get your money's worth here.  I've had the shrimp and crab leg \"Wu\" boils, and yea they tasted good, and I ate almost everything in front of me, it didn't exactly knock me off my feet and the portions were small.  The corn is excellent, the sausage is just - meh.  I tried both the kimchi lemon butter and the chunky Cajun sauces.  They differences were minimal, as they were both butter-based.

The service was also less than impressive.  I dunno, its sometimes frustrating when you see that although they are well-staffed, everything seems to take longer than it should - from someone to come over and initially greet you, to someone clearing you're plates away once you are done.    

Although I am not dying to come back anytime soon, I'm sure I'll give Wu's another shot once they've got the kinks worked out."}
{"text":"First time here...had the shrimp boil w/ Wu Seasoning it was good, very tasty with the selection of seasonings. My only down side was my quantity didn't seem to match the price. The waitress was very nice and attentive. I love the decor of the restaurant and will more than likely come back."}
{"text":"Super trendy place! I was surprised to find that it wasn't too busy on a Friday night. We were seated within 10 minutes. Our waitress happened to be one of my mom's customers and she was so sweet! 

We ordered a ton of stuff. Some of my favorites were Wu's Street Corn, Buttermilk Beignets, and the BBQ Shrimp. We gave the Gumbo Ramen a try and I don't really like it. The crawfish is so fishy and it makes it really hard to eat the noodles since it seeps in the liquid. The Roasted Broccoli was dry. The Korean Spare Ribs were good, but it could use a little more flavoring and sauce. The food comes out pretty quick though!! It was a fun eating experience, I dig the outdoor seating and the decor!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, ambiance and server. Katie hooked us up with great drinks and knew everything on the menu. Randomly drove past here and it caught our eye. Great spot for a Friday night."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time coming here. Food comes out very cold and service is slow.  Sent food back once and came out cold again."}
{"text":"Really loved the vibe here and the decorations. There was no wait on a weekday dinner. The service was fun and helpful. I had the curry noodles and they were great! The portion was a little small. My friend had the gumbo noodles which were spicy, smoky, and yummy. We tried the beignets which were so good. There were plenty of them and they were super fluffy. Parking was available and easy!"}
{"text":"This place was so great! Megan was our server and she was so sweet and attentive. We ordered the gumbo, BBQ shrimp, street corn, and per Megan's recommendation, the tuna poke (which was my favorite). I also got the sake sangria which was delicious. Definitely will come again. The only thing that bothered me was having to swat away flies the whole time I was eating but still a great experience!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying this new place so we headed out as a family waitress was horrible waited on  appetizer that we never received and were told oh I didn't know that you wanted that ok... never came back to take my drink order watched her stand up front and talk definitely not going back to see Taylor again"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Weird concept, makes deciding what to eat confusing. Tried a lot of the apps, nothing was amazing.For the price of stuff I expected more. Drinks were not strong. Service was good."}
{"text":"Okay, I was a little worried because when we walked in I saw a sanatation rating of 92.7. Scary right? Well the service was amazing and so was the food. I got the cajun fried crab and it was absolutely amazing. However, it was really spicy! We also shared the cauliflower and that was really good but also really spicy. My husband got the gator rolls and those were really good and not spicy. The atmosphere was really good. I got the Hurricane Kasa-obake and it was ok. It was really pretty but I wish it was a little sweeter."}
{"text":"Not the \"Cajun\" I was expecting for sure. I was looking for some authentic gumbo and found something completely different. I do not recommend this place if you came to \"eat\". Drinks were amazing though! But the food was not. We ordered gumbo ramen and regretted it shortly after. We were told it was the most popular thing on the menu but one bite of it and we had to return it immediately. Salt nor hot sauce could fix it.. I apologized to the waitress that I did not mind paying for it even though we sent it back. She even agreed it was not a tasty dish and needed a lot of work. For your server to admit a dish on the menu was not good took us back a bite. None the less we ate our calamari and drank our drinks and left. If we ever come back it would be for the amazing drinks and that is all."}
{"text":"Very good service excellent food and the best gumbo since I moved from Louisiana! !!!!"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to coming to this place. I saw this as a hot new business in town and figured I'd check it out as soon as I get a chance. So the usual homie dinner turned into a double date dinner + my baby. 

Our waitress was pretty attentive even when the dinner crowd starting trickling in. But the food is seriously lacking and confusing. 

Is it a seafood spot?
Is it a cajun spot?
It is Asian?

.... it is all 3???

I mean I get the eclectic nature and vibe of this place, but it just wasn't hittin it for me. 

Perhaps the only dishes that make sense to me are the boils. Perhaps I was really soured by the whole ramen gumbo concept. 

Before I get to that. I ordered an Arnold Palmer until I saw the She's a Lychee. I LOVE lychee, so I was salivating over this. Yeeeeaaaa... not a winner. It was pretty watered down from jump and it could be because the entire glass is filled with crushed ice. Cute, but not effective in the flavor department. on the ramen...

The Ramen Gumbo was definitely a fail. I had a big clump of noodles mixed in the separated noodles and they were pretty gummy as opposed to the soft and slippery texture I was expecting. The gumbo gravy was meh. It was pretty thick and the flavor was nothing new or different from what I've had at other places. So I'm not sure why this even exists. This dish is just.... confusing. 

The street corn was good. I did share with my husband and daughter so I only had a 1/3 of a corn ear which didn't allow me to savor the flavor, but it was definitely worth a try. 

My husband ordered the shrimp boil which had a really good sauce. I'm not a fan of pork sausage, so I think it would have been better with turkey sausage. When they first brought it out, I didn't think it would be enough food; however, it ended up being more than enough. Luckily for me, my husband was kind enough to let me finish off his boil while he choked down the last of my ramen gumbo. 

My homie had the kung pao cauliflower which was pretty good, but this including all of our food was room temperature. If there are dishes ready, just send them out. Don't have them sitting under a heating lamp until everyone's food is available. I appreciate hot food and maybe a \"we're working on bringing out the rest of the food\". 

Iono man, this place is so so. The service is not enough for me to come back tho. Plus there are too many restaurants opening and closing in Charlotte. I didn't even get a chance to check out Nan Byrons in this same location before they closed. 

On to the next spot..."}
{"text":"Not your typical cajun restaurant. Wu's prices give enough for what you pay for. As a new establishment its definitely worth trying. For my visit I got LB of shrimp and mussels and tasted really fresh and got some variety of sauces to select. Hence the reason I said not the typical cajun restaurant where they have one sauce in the bag. Restaurant did have parking area and service was excellent"}
{"text":"Came here a couple weeks ago with my fiancé. The street corn was amazing- you have to order it! The shrimp boil was good, but it needed more seasoning... like a lot more. But overall it was a great dining experience and out waitress was very attentive and helpful. I would come back again to try something else!"}
{"text":"If 10 stars was an option, WU's would get it. The blacken ol' fashion was spot on and so damn tasty. Next up was the Cajun crab roll, which was incredible. My main course, and the climax of my meal, was the gumbo. I have been to New Orleans many a times and that gumbo is a far cry from Wu's. Come here now. This place is the sh*t. I'm so glad I found it on Yelp."}
{"text":"Charlotte seems to have a bunch of fusion restaurants and Wu's has Asian and Cajun mashed up well. I understand the the chef is Cajun. The place is loud with many large screen TV's tuned to sports. It has an open patio which connects to the inside through a removable wall. There is a near by church that rings bells  half hourly which my wife and i enjoyed. The patio has red and green blinking lights  which over all were kind of dim; there is better lighting inside. The staff and service was great on a weekday night. My wife left her purse and the pretty waitress actually called a number of local hotels looking for us. That was above and beyond but even before then she was ready to meet al our special requests  (white rice on the side, a different kind of spoon for my wife, hot towels etc) quickly and with a big smile. It really made the evening extra nice. The food was very good, inventive and different. The Gumbos ere tasty  but you could ask for the hot peppers on the side as they had a bit too much heat. The Barbecue shrimp was excellent, the shrimp slightly under-cooked (which is how I like them) and the sauce very tasty. Not exactly like I've had in New Orleans but maybe even better. The ramen noodles in the gumbo were a great idea and the noodles were also slightly underdone  (which was perfect). Bread pudding was like french toast  but goos flavor and crispy with sour cherries. Yum! They have sushi and sake and other Asian choices. Over all a fun place with some unique cooking. Prices were fairly reasonable for the location and quality."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a colleague and it was absolutely delicious. We started with the roasted broccoli and the street corn, OMG was that good. I had the WU boil with snow crab and it did not disappoint. An amazing dinner from finish to start. Alex took great care of us during the dinner, even though it was quiet busy at the time. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in Charlotte for work!!"}
{"text":"After a few more visits here, I have really enjoyed it. I wish there was less carb heavy dishes and parking situation is OK especially at off peak times."}
{"text":"Very interesting place! Cajun and Asian.  Ceiling is beautifully tiled.  Open air restaurant yet not hot.  I had a wedge salad with shrimp dumplings my friend had ribs.  The salad had lots of dressing and red onions and tomatoes and two skewers of shrimp.  I wish the bathroom was not so dark though and that the stall door had a hook to hang your purse.  Good service."}
{"text":"In the heart of South End, this restaurant boast vibrant colors that lure you into their Cajun spell. The wait staff is friendly and pretty accurate regarding the time it was going to take to be seated. The music fit bright, upbeat decor. The patrons were very diverse, which was an added plus. The food: OMG, the General Taos Cauliflower is a dish made made vegan warrior King. It was crisp and full of favor. For my meal I had the BBQ shrimp, another culinary delight. The shrimp was steamed to perfection and laced in a bowl of marinated jalapeño's, cilantro, and a dancing, light creamy BBQ sauce. A non-chain seafood joint is what Charlotte needs"}
{"text":"So I was super excited when I heard about this spot opening.  Finally got to go with my lady tonight.  Being a Cajun guy I was looking forward to the crawdad boil.  The crawdad were good but should have been spicier.  My gal at the kale salad which she really enjoyed. So why just three stars? 

1) I wish the waitress had explained the menu a little bit.  She was not really on point.  Saw other tables get an explanation of the menu 

2) I'm not big on the saran wrap on top of the boil.  Why not take it off just before you bring the meal out? 

3) No bowl to put the shells in?  I mean really? 

4) No bread?  I think a few pieces of bread to dip in the sauce would go a long way."}
{"text":"I can only offer the excuse on why it took me so long to try Wu's is that I  was having a hard time wrapping my head around the concept of cajun asian seafood.  

I dropped in on a Friday night for dinner with my husband and one other couple.  We were seated immediately and our server was quick to greet us and provide drinks.  The menu offers a wide variety of options - I went with the Asian Cobb Salad with seared tuna, and it was AWESOME!  I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of the other salad options.  

A couple people at my table ordered noodle bowls - those looked okay, but they were not thestars of the show.  I would stick with the seafood and cajun options over the asian noodle options."}
{"text":"Fun place on South Blvd - interesting menu, which is always welcome.  I had the Oyster PoBoy which was fantastic - plenty of oysters, nice sauce, served hot!  And I thought the chair cushions were cool!  Plus, I saw them take delivery of the giant crocodile mannequin that sits outside - this dude just walked by the window with it on his shoulder - was a funny sight!"}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow. Waitress was inexperienced. They mentioned several times that the kitchen was backed up. Not a big fan at this point. Waited more than an hour for our food. Draft beers were not working as well. Brutal."}
{"text":"WARNING! Do not spend your money here!!!They steal!! Went in and my bill was one total and i paid waitress a cash tip, the next day when i checked my account i see that my card was authorized for more than what i ordered. I called to speak to the manager and he proceeded to tell me that the waitress totals add up to what she made that night, and it must be something my bank did (yeah like my bank is just going to automatically add more charges on my account) so I call my bank and was told that clearly my card was charged twice. I went back to this establishment the next day to ask for a copy of my receipt, but was told by the hostess that no manager was on duty and he was the only one who could produce my receipt   so i begin to explain my situation to the hostess and she tells me \"Thats funny, someone just came in about an hour ago saying the same thing.\" I have written the manager an email stating that I would like my receipt and he has yet to respond. So clearly this establishment is committing credit card fraud! Wish i could give this place 0 stars"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place a chance.  It looks nice and in a great location. I went in for lunch one day. It was pretty empty. I sat at the bar.  The bartender gave me menu and drink menu. After a while she came back and asked what would I like to drink. I said I will start off with water (which I thought meant I will order a drink later) She took my drink menu so I was like ok guess just water today. I order the r amen jambalaya. Now I'm kinda of use of hanging out a bar and talking with bartender especially if it's not busy. Well I guess I wasn't giving off friendly vibes or she wasn't friendly. My food came out and I was so disappointed. The r amen was cold and not cooked through. There was barely any jambalaya or any soup the go with it. New the end of my meal the bartender started to get friendly. I was so disappointed. Bad food bad service, I wish I had alcohol it might have made the meal better. I will probably not go back unless there are some serious changes."}
{"text":"The kung pao cauliflower wasn't as great as the reviews, it could use a little more flavor.  I could be biased as I was comparing it to the level of flavor in Fern's buffalo cauliflower.  The customer service was ok, as our server was eating lunch at the same time as we were and often came over with crumbs on her mouth.  I had the tuna poke as an entree and it was quite tasty.  The tuna was super fresh.  My boyfriend had the calamari po boy and cajun fried crab rolls.  All of the dishes were tasty, just the cauliflower was oversold. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing. I lived in New Orleans for 5 years so I was so excited for a Cajun restaurant where I could get crawfish! Unfortunately, the crawfish in my steamer bowl were gross! Anyone who's eaten crawfish knows, out of the pound you eat there will be a couple that are just \"off\". Well out of my bowl at Wu's every single one was \"off\". Not sure if they used frozen crawfish (is that even possible?) or what but I was so disappointed, I didn't even eat them all. The sauce was delicious, so maybe if you get one of the other seafood options you're safe???
My husband got the gumbo ramen which was luke warm and pretty weird- it's noodles in a really thick gumbo sauce. 

There were several things on the menu I wanted to try but I'd be hesitant to go back given the fact that neither of us liked our meals. 

The vibe is really cool and they have a nice patio."}
{"text":"We went there for Queens Feast. Ordered BBQ shrimp for an extra appetizer which was delicious! Crab rolls were not crab but imitation crabmeat and we're very spicy.  Ribs were OK however very salty. Ramen again OK but hardly had any broth. Our server was amazing!!!  Probably will go back and try their brunch."}
{"text":"My friend and I went for dinner the other night and it was very disappointing. We're both servers and I need to state that our server did the best she could. My friend got crab legs and they took around an hour. We had to go somewhere so we couldn't wait any longer. Our server asked if her manager had come out and talked to us but she had not. As a sever I felt disappointed in their gm as it's not the servers responsibility to explain their party why food is taking an hour. The place is real cute but no crab was had and my noodles were meh. But boy howdy that was the best wedge salad of my life, there's your star"}
{"text":"Food is incredible.

Service is awful. We never leave bad tips but my family felt just a 10% tip was actually more than generous considering how bad the service was.

Waited 20 minutes past our reservation time to get sat.

Wasn't greeted by a server for about 10 mins

Ordered cocktails. Half of the drinks were delivered about 10 minutes later. The other half took another 20 minutes to come to the table.

My sister ordered coffee and asked for milk--twice. Eventually we had to literally walk into the kitchen and ask someone to give us some creamer or milk for her coffee.

We ordered dessert, and our waitress brought the check and then said goodnight to us.... but the dessert hadn't even come out yet! 

The menu and cocktails are awesome but when the service is this bad I just don't see myself coming back"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Wu's new brunch menu, I highly recommend it!! I had the potato hash with a fried egg on top, and I wish I had gotten a picture; Chef Troy outdid himself! We sat at the bar and had excellent service with Laura, as well. My favorite part about the new brunch menu is the new list of cocktails, I LOVE the new Lychee Mimosa (Almost as good as the She's A Lychee). Definitely the new hot spot for brunch in South End!!"}
{"text":"The fact that this restaurant has been empty the past three visits is an indicator of what's to come. Sort of has a Myrtle Beach feel. 

The street corn, Kung Pao Cauliflower and Cajun Fried Roll are the best things on the menu. STOP HERE! Enjoy your appetizers, finish your drinks and leave.

My family of 4 has tried almost ALL of the entrees on the menu and we all agree...FLAVORLESS!!  We wanted to love this place. It's adorable and new and seems like a unique fusion of flavors. Wrong! 

Our lunch today was our FINAL visit. I have ordered the Kale Goat Cheese salad on all 3 visits. 

Visit #1 Salad was amazing with the exception of inedible corn silks covering it. The waitress was perplexed when I showed her my \"hairy\" salad. She took it back to the kitchen and returned telling me apologetically that the salad is prepared on the same surface that the corn is shucked and the silks must have been accidentally chopped into the salad. No biggie. You know that feeling when you get a bit of wrapper in your bite and it won't break down while you chew? This is what it is like to eat a salad covered in corn silks. Thank you Wu's for owning the mistake. 

Visit #2 I wanted the Kale Goat Cheese salad sans silks. I was ahead of the game and asked that it not be prepared near the corn station. I told the server my previous salad experience. my salad came out covered in corn silks!! Seriously? They reluctantly took it off of my bill. The rest of our meals were bland and just meh. Still, I wanted to like this place. I really did. 

Visit #3  Yes! I ordered it again!! But only because 10 minutes after ordering Curry Noodles our server informed us that Wu's had run out of curry. After our server discussed my special request for a silk-free salad with the folks in the kitchen, she returned to tell me that the culprit was actually the quinoa. Wrong. Try again. Back to the kitchen she went. The manager got involved, discussed this with the cook and told me it was Kale husk. No such thing sir. The cook came out to show me Kale. \"Sometimes the kale machine puts stem into the salad,\" he said. Nope. I know kale stem. Just bring me a salad without 1\" yellow, silky strings on it. A few minutes later the cook returns to our table only to blame it on the ginger and a faulty immersion blender!!!  Eventually the salad arrived, silk free and FLAVORLESS!!  

The manager never checked on my salad. Our drinks stayed empty and the server couldn't find me a shaker of salt to save her life. We won't be back."}
{"text":"What a wonderful Saturday afternoon spent at Wu's! Our experience started with our delightful and very informative bartender, Laura. She gave us the background of the restaurant and made delicious suggestions. Kung Pao cauliflower was excellent as well as the BBQ shrimp-awesome sauce!! We were more in 'an appetizer type' mood so we didn't even make it to the main courses. We look forward to that on our next visit. Thank you for a great experience here, Laura! We'll be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Everything is delicious from the bbq shrimp, to the boils, and the beignets!! I highly recommended coming if you love seafood and great service!!"}
{"text":"The Kung Pao Cauliflower & the BBQ Shrimp are bomb! The cauliflower has a little heat but a sweet Asian flare and the shrimp sauce is seasoned just right.  I dont like cauliflower but this was absolutely tge best I ever tried.Those two seem to the most popular and I know whu it was definitely was good eats!!! We also got the shrimp boil 1/2 lb. The boil is very pricey & only for 1 person for the 1/2. I had better crab boil before at other places. I will come back for the other 2 we ate."}
{"text":"This is a great new spot. Good for the area of South End. Great location and the server was wonderful and super friendly. Very engaging and checked on us. The weather was perfect. Parking is a bit scarce but hey use Rite Aid's. Lol"}
{"text":"This is only on the appetizers because I went late night (12am) is when the kitchen closes. The place has a cool vibe and well decorated. The food was delicious seasoned just right and cook properly. I definitely will go back to try more. The cocktails looked fun but didn't have any next time.A must try spot. Btw service was good and didn't mind that I slipped in at the last minute."}
{"text":"Lately,I've been trying to take more pictures but I was so hungry I couldn't wait to eat.Sorry everyone!

Food:I ordered the shrimp boil with the Wu's Seasoning.It was flavorful including the corn,potatoes,and sausage. I like how you have the option to select different types of seasoning/butter sauce. Now,I would say if you are from somewhere wherein shrimp boils is common then this may not meet your higher expectations.However,I still found it to be satisfying.

Drinks:They have a couple of unique drinks.We ordered some type of sangria with fresh berries which I enjoyed.

Parking Lot:The parking is annoying as there is limited parking in front of the restaurant.The actual parking spots are tight too.

Customer Service:Acceptable,no complaints

Decor:It is so cute in there!I love the variation of decor.There are also plenty of large TVs available.

Cost:Appropriate,I didn't find anything to be overpriced.

Setting:I love the music selection.I found myself singing away as I was eating my food which just really created a nice setting in my eyes.

Overall,I'll return!"}
{"text":"Nice Cajun seafood place , our waiter barely filled up our drinks other than that it's a nice place if your looking for a nice chill spot to eat seafood , I personally think the prices was a little high for the amount of food you get. Other than that , I might be back on Thursday's where they have 1/2 lb shrimp for $16 versus regular price $22."}
{"text":"DON'T MISS THIS PLACE! It is absolutely delicious. Yes Asian Cajun sounds like an out of the box combo but WOW! My tastebuds are having Marci Gras with a dancing dragon in my mouth. Since everything looked delicious I decided to try the house specialities. I got the fried cauliflower for an appetizer and I can't think of anything to say because my mind is blown! For my meal I had the Gumbo with ramen. Now I always thought ramen was the skinny anemic noodles you get in the package from the supermarket. I'm glad to say I was wrong! House made ramen is much better then what you get at the supermarket (think ramen on steroids). Wu's does it right. For dessert I got the apple ginger pie roll. What a perfect way to end this meal. My one complaint is that there was nothing to soak up the fabulous sauce from my super tasty gumbo! Everything was top notch. Thank you for taking such good care of me Christina :) Wu's has made a fan out of me!"}
{"text":"As a native New Orleanian, it usually is a rule of thumb that you do not eat cajun food outside of New Orleans. It's taboo even. Luckily, there are no rules about cajun/seafood/asian fusion. It was such a quirky idea that I had to try it while in Charlotte and I was not disappointed. I had the scallion noodles and street corn and greatly enjoyed both (though you may want to ask for the sauce on the side and just have them douse the corn up with the seasoning they use). Also had the roasted garlic (excellent) and the crawfish fried rice (which was an interesting blend of dirty rice, crawfish, and then chinese stirfried with seasonings and egg as you would expect in chinese fried rice) that was also surprisingly delicious. And then there were the apple pie eggrolls. Partake...just partake."}
{"text":"The service was great, but I can't say the same about the food. On top of that, I'm very disappointed about their false advertisements. If you put something online about your specials and not planning for it go into effect into the following week...please specify put the date on your website."}
{"text":"this place is seriously insanely expensive for the amount of food u get...i would not come here again... $30 for a lb of snow crab, like seriously? The sauces are not even that great. all u can taste in the seasoning is the butter...  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. OVER-PRICED AF. POOR VALUE."}
{"text":"I could probably eat Wu's sushi rice tuna poke all day every day and never get sick of it. It's one of those appetizers that you wish was a main course. In fact, when my husband and I went, we got it as an appetizer to split, and both got a boil that we enjoyed (he got mussels and I got shrimp) but, upon leaving, we both said we would get the sushi rice tuna poke for ourselves as an appetizer. 

I really loved my lychee cocktail. I asked for no simple syrup (I'm not a sweet drink person) and it was perfect in my eyes. I had two! It was a tad expensive, but all specialty cocktails are. My husband's beer was very reasonably priced.

We'll be back to Wu's for sure."}
{"text":"The food was a no go!! Service was nothing great. Honestly hated it so much I got a yelp just to yelp about it. There should be a 0 star option."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks! Try the \"She's a Lychee\" drink- you won't be disappointed. Wu bowl with shrimp was amazing. Calamari, beef short ribs, and gator balls apps were fantastic. Go!"}
{"text":"Wow! We drove way past it so a little tip it's located right near CVS, and the parking is tight so beware. I love love the red interior of wu's! 
We ordered the street corn, crawlfish fried rice, broccoli, Cajun fried crab roll, gumbo ramen, BBQ shrimp, and buttermilk beignets! All the main food came out all together, and OMG I got to say the street corn was my FAV! You must must order this if you go to WU's! I also hate broccoli but I really enjoyed wu's broccoli as well! I also recommend ordering the crab roll- yumm! The fried rice and BBQ shrimp was alright, but I did not enjoy the ramen it tasted funny! 
We also got 2lbs of the crawl fish it was also pretty good. Thumbs up for wu's!"}
{"text":"What an outstanding place to explore fusions of three of my favorite cuisines! Went in on a Saturday afternoon to soak up a little sun on their South Boulevard patio and to enjoy a late lunch. My hunger combined with an enticing menu made me want to grow another stomach. And, my Louisiana-loving friends, there is a rotating Abita beer on tap. Today's offering was Purple Haze. Je voudrais un biere, s'il vous plait (the only phrase I remember from college French).

The classic rock playing in the background was awesome -- AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Journey, Bon Jovi, etc. 

I truly wanted one of everything I saw on the menu. The combinations were so imaginative and were mouth-watering even on paper. We decided to have half a dozen oysters while we perused the menu, They are served with kimchi cocktail sauce and a white wine mignonette that accented the oysters perfectly.

Jahniece, our wonderful server, answered all of our questions and made excellent recommendations. My husband decided on the Gumbo Ramen, a generous dish with thick, kitchen-made noodles and a spicy, traditional gumbo base featuring seafood and andouille sausage (you can get it with the traditional rice if you prefer), topped with a kimchi-marinated egg, perfectly soft-boiled. I had the Kung Pao cauliflower. Oh. My. GOSH! I'm no vegetarian, but this dish could probably satisfy a carnivore without any complaints. Crispy florets perfectly breaded with spicy sauce and fresno chilies -- kick the peppers off if you prefer less burn, but I found them to be an amazing addition to the dish. 

Afterward, we decided to share the grilled pineapple foster with beignets. It comes with vanilla ice cream that is rich and custard-like. Perfect finish to a terrific meal. 

I can't say enough positive things about Wu's. I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Music and atmosphere were great. Food not so much. The waitress said the chili-garlic flavored steamed shrimp was hot and very spicy. Not so much. The temperature of the food was barely warm and we were 1 of 3 tables. 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is great! I've now been back twice and never have any issues or a very super long wait. The kale salad with tuna is amazing!!! Loved the short ribs app as well. Overall this is a great place for dinner or apps and drinks. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday. They were out of the two beers I wanted and ran out of the wine we were drinking after the first glass. The service was OK. Food was average. Two of our party ordered curry chicken and it was bland - they didn't eat it. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came for the soft opening everything was delicious Adam and Alyssa where very nice and helpful I got the mussel broil in in WU's sauce, the alligator roll and the street corn everything was so good I also got a hurricane drink it was strong but good. I will definitely be back to try more stuff"}
{"text":"I really dig this spot. Food is amazing. The cauliflower was amazing please order that. We went like night great perfect ending to the perfect evening!"}
{"text":"We ordered oysters, calamari, shrimp boil (Wu's seasoning) and crawfish boil (Chucky Cajun & Fresh Jerk). The food was great, it would be excellent if the boils had more spices and were more flavorful. Our waitress Ashley was very attentive, 10 out of 10."}
{"text":"Great environment, service & food! I was able to find some tasty non-meat options! The cauliflower is a must have! The corn is delicious as well! The drinks are huge! Loved the sangria! The apple ginger roll for dessert was a perfect finale! I'd definitely come again!"}
{"text":"The food is truly horrible - greasy and tasteless - soaked in oil - waitress took our lunch order right away but food seemed to take forever to come out if the kitchen and the place was not that crowded. I'll never go back!"}
{"text":"I had a very pleasing experience.

The entree had a spicy taste (my choice). Great balance of Asian and a slight Cajun medley of flavor.

Shrimp was fresh, and the spices were not overwhelming."}
{"text":"FOOD: I had the Cajun Fried Crab Roll and Kung Pao Cauliflower with a She's a Lychee drink. The Cajun Fried Crab was ok, I could have had at without the goat cheese. Now it might have tasted better if they had regular soy sauce, they only had lite sodium soy sauce. Maybe the could get some packs of regular soy sauce for those who ask for it. The Cauliflower was really good and spicy. The Shes a Lychee drink was ok it was a good flavor. I told the waitress that I did not like sweet drinks and she said it was sweet so she did not put much syrup in it. Now my opinion; the drink was  $9 bucks and  you get a glass full of shaved ice and maybe like 5 or 6 sips!! Drink it fast or ALL that ice will melt and we will be drinking water. The seafood boiled was a bit pricey and looking at other ppl seafood boil it was not a lot so that's why I did not get the seafood boil which was the reason I went there. 

INSIDE: Really nice decor very New Orleans with a Asian twist. They have TV's and outdoor seating. Now they ONLY have ONE Board with the prices of the Seafood Boil and seafood prices. Which can NOT be seen from all the tables in the restaurant.  And If you have a hard time seeing, you will have to leave your seat in order to see it. 

EMPLOYEES: Our waitress asked us have we ever been there before and we said no (bc we haven't). She was VERY HELPFUL AND GREAT WITH EXPLAINING things and she knew the menu. WHICH IS A PLUS!! Now the only thing was at the end when we was almost done eating we felt rushed just a little but she was not pushing. 

OVERALL: Yes I would eat here again ONLY IF my husband or my friends wanted to go there, I will go  with them. I was not super pressed."}
{"text":"Wu's has good service and a nice open seating plan when we showed up for lunch. From the hostess to the waitress to even having the chef bring out one course was a good experience and being the first ones in for the lunch crowd it took a little while for things to get going which worked out fine. From the starters definitely get the Kung pao cauliflower it's a must try. Also would recommend General Wu's chicken for anyone who wants something they know they'll like since it is pretty in line with what you'd expect from Asian food."}
{"text":"This was the best Cajun food we've had since coming to Charlotte. Excellent service (Lexie was fantastic). We had the smoked oysters and the shrimp crab boil (better than some in Louisiana). The beer was cold and the music was old school on point!!! Definitely recommend Wu's!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was truly excited to visit and it was my first time. I'd read all the reviews and looked at different post via Instagram. Parking was available, wasn't to bad this particular day.  Walked into the restaurant with a party of 5 and was greeted promptly.  I got a lil skeptical because the grade was a 92, but I sucked it up. The hostess stated it would be a hour wait and we couldn't understand because it was plenty of tables available and we asked and was told the kitchen was bagged up and guest would be seated once the kitchen was caught up. So we went to sit outside to wait on the kitchen to catch up and wait on an already available table. We met a waitress by the name of Taylor James, whom was a doll. We asked for menus so that we cld have them to look at so by the time the table became available we would know what we wanted. Taylor comes back out and was like they said no menus could be given because you can't skip in front of others that has been waiting. Another waitress comes out to explain the same thing. It's not uncommon for a restaurant to give out menus to help speed up the process once the party has been seated.  With all the chaos about a menu we ended up leaving and going to Outback off of University. We visited on 7/22/2017 after viewing the movie Girls Trip."}
{"text":"We came to Wu's at the recommendation from a friend. So we ordered an appetizer, The calamari was in a great butter sauce but was luke warm! Then I ordered the chicken sandwich which was full of flavor but here again not hot. Wifey's lobster was a little over cooked and to top it all off we waited about 30 mins or more for anything to come out so I'm just blah for Wu's. I may try them again in the future to see if there's a positive change."}
{"text":"Went here for a company luncheon and was so surprised at how absolutely DELICIOUS everything was!!!  Tuna Poke and the Cauliflower appetizers were amazing!!!   Sweet staff and funky decor.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great spot! We had a party of 8, good service, they got us in quickly and we had a drink at the bar while we waited for the rest of the party. We had the crab legs (amazing) and street corn-we will absolutely be back!!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar. Service was slow. Had to wave down one of the 3 bartenders if you wanted anything. Food was definitely disappointing. Super salty tuna poke. Tasted like they just poured and kept on pouring soy sauce all over it. Their cauliflower special was overly fried and dry. This is how unimpressed we were, I can't even remember our third dish.  Hopefully it improves over time."}
{"text":"I will start by saying the atmosphere of this restaurant is awesome. I really love how open it feels and the decor is perfect. Now on to the food...my friend and I both ordered the Sangria which I will DEFINITELY order again. For appetizers we ordered the fried cauliflower and the calamari. Both were delicious and I will be back for the calamari for sure. My friend and I had a little mishap with our entrees so I will not rate those. It wouldn't be fair to do so because it was rectified immediately. What I will say is that their customer service is spot on. Management was on it and made sure we were happy when we left. Our waitress Jem was awesome as well. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with this establishment. I did the responsible thing and called before I came to make sure they were doing all you can eat crab legs. I was told they did all you can until closing. Upon hearing this, I gathered my group and made my to Wu's. Once we arrived, we asked the hostess if they were still doing all you can eat crab and again were told yes. However, when the waitress came over and we ordered our crab legs she told us the special ended at nine. Imagine our surprise and shock. We literally called before we came and confirmed with the hostess. We asked the waitress if we could speak with the manager and she said she would tell him to come over. The manager came over with the \"no\" face. He pretended to listen to us explain how we called before coming and once we stopped talking he asked who we had spoken to. I'm sorry I don't make a habit of asking the names of people I'm talking to on the phone. I trust the word of the person answering the phone and giving me information on your establishment. This establishment had the ability to honor their employee's word and chose to say no anyway. I will never come here again. I told the manager this much as well. If your employee messed up and i relies on her word and drove alllllllll the way over here, i feel like you should make it right. He clearly didn't agree and now i will never come here again. My friends won't either.  Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Super salty seafood served in a cooking bowl, Greasy chicken and undercooked, ramen under cooked, wasnt happy especially cause it was over priced. The host was rude, but our server was nice just not attentive. My first time there. Not sure if it was an off night but they need to step it up"}
{"text":"First time visiting Wu's Cajun Seafood and it did not disappoint. This place stays packed and I'm glad I finally got the chance to try it. I had the bbq shrimp and the crawfish fried rice, while my fiancé had the shrimp crab broil. Everything was seasoned to perfection and so tasty. I didn't care too much for the broccoli but that's the ONLY negative about this place. Even the tea was excellent. Big big big kudos to our waitress who was such the professional, gave excellent choices to choose from (hence the bbq shrimp) and the personality of an angel, literally. The decor and ambiance was quaint and cozy. I'll definitely be back and will be bringing more guest"}
{"text":"We walked in around 9:30pm and thought they were closing as they were cleaning up. Online it stated they didn't close until midnight. We asked the hostess if they were still open and serving food and she had no idea! She asked one of the waitresses leaving. She informed us that although they were open until midnight, there is only a limited menu from 10pm on. Which is fine but should say so on the website so folks aren't coming expecting to eat good!

We ordered the street corn, gumbo noodle dish, and a crab leg boil. Unfortunately, I was very underwhelmed by everything we ordered. The \"boil\" had more dry seasoning in it than anything else. The sauce comes on the side, which defeats the purpose of a \"boil\"! 

Won't be back. There are MUCH better places in town for seafood for cheaper and better portions! Cute concept but misses the mark."}
{"text":"We stopped in here one Friday evening around 7 and were seated immediately. There's outside seating and seating in this garage type area which has the door open. It just rained so we picked the garage type area. We got the shrimp toast as an appetizer..it was white bread topped with shrimp and maybe cheese and deep fried. It's a little greasy but it was okay. For my meal I got the chicken sandwich and my friend got the pork belly which was a special that night and recommended by the waitress. The food was so good!! My chicken sandwich had a type of coke slaw and a special dressing they mix there on it. My friends pork belly came with rice and he loved it! Very cute date spot and very nice wait staff!"}
{"text":"Me and my honey got really sick eating here. I really wanted to love it because it's really cute. It was brand new when we went, so hopefully it's gotten better."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here on Sunday with my friend. The drink was great. We offered several appetizers and really liked them all. We didn't care for the barbecue shrimp and sent it back. No issues and it was removed from the bill. Seamless process. The staff was really nice and the place was nicely decorated with a modern feel. My favorite thing was the sushi and the street corn. But we also liked the cauliflower although quite spicy. I hope everyone tries this place."}
{"text":"I love trying out restaurants in South End. I had noticed this restaurant and drove by it many times. The wait staff was extremely friendly as well as the hostesses when you walk in. I just wish the food was better. It was more of a \"food court\" experience. We tried sushi options, calamari, the crab legs, the BBQ shrimp and cauliflower. All of it was average."}
{"text":"Bottle Cap Group serves lackluster food at all of their bars and restaurants. Fun atmosphere and wide variety of TVs/games makes up for bad food at their other locations, but Wu's doesn't have either. Imagine Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, Joe's Crab Shack and 5 Church had an awkward, ugly baby. This place won't make it. Mark my words."}
{"text":"My sister and I went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't super busy. The decor is fun and the food was good. My sister got the shrimp boil and LOVED it. I had the Cajun chicken ramen boil, I don't know that I'd order that again but it wasn't bad. It looked more special than it tasted. But I tasted some of my sister's shrimp and it was amazing! The staff really won us over as there was a rude customer at a near by table and without making a scene or server and the manager handled the situation better than I could have asked. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Where to begin.... I wanted to try this place since everybody buzzing about it. The I love the decor of the place and the Asian Cajun concept. Morgan our waitress was great, very knowledgeable about the food and drink menu. My friend and I try to double team the menu. The appetizers are very well proportioned. We got the corn, must try, and also the fried calamari. The calamari was ok could be bigger pieces. For the entrees I got the Fried Crab roll, which was good, but the goat chees over powered the crab. Great flavor all around. Last but not least the sweets. I tried the beignets, if you've had beignets from Cafe Du Monde they a good 2nd. We also tried the Grilled Pineapple Foster, a must try!! Oh let me not forget the drinks I tried the Sake Sangria very good drink strong. The pricing was good for the amount of food you get. I would definitely recommend this spot. I will be back to conquer the menu. Very pleased."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and experienced many of the cool menu options that are available. I've been pleased some days. And others not so much. I have a hard time finding which days to frequent being that the taste of food depends on the chef. I'm not used to that. The sever(s) told me \"It Depends on the chef...\" I was told there was no alcohol/ingredients to make the Hurricane drink. However, I saw a table being served that very drink. There were also no crabs. This makes the second time. U til a server politely informed my table. They found some. But, the kitchen is closing. Seems to be many kitchen issues. Or management problems. The one server Amanda is a breath of fresh air. Making the experience at least memorable. Offering her suggestions on menu items based on our likes, was great. I really enjoyed the cauliflower. The blackened catfish didn't taste fresh. I really enjoy the concept of the atmosphere and location. Each visit a host runs to open the door. That has become annoying. I can't even open the door for my date because they're awkwardly running over."}
{"text":"PRO TIP: parking is FREE! Valet is no longer required here like it was for the previous restaurant that occupied Wu's space. Hooray!

Why it took us so long to check out this super-unique spot, I couldn't tell ya, but what I CAN say is that the hubby and I will definitely be back. Great place if you're looking for unique food and tasty cocktails, both of which you'll find at Wu's. 

First and foremost, hubby and I met two other couples here on a Friday night at 7 pm. I'd made a reservation earlier that week thinking it would be slammed, but there was plenty of seating inside the restaurant and outside on the patio (our choice for the unseasonably warm February night). The crowd picked up as the night went out, but there were still a lot of empty tables. Maybe Wu's hasn't caught on yet with CLT foodies. 

Anyway, our table shared the buttermilk fried calamari, which allowed all 6 of us to have a decent taste. I went with the chopped kale salad and added shrimp because our server said you can't go wrong with the salads - she was so right. The large slice of fried goat cheese sold me right off the bat, and it was super flavorful. WARNING: if you're not a spice person (I am not), be careful of the red peppers. They're really intense.

My husband got the blackened catfish sandwich and it was literally the size of his forearm. He ate the whole thing, so I'd say he was pretty happy with his choice."}
{"text":"Great new spot in Southend! A twist of Asian Fusion with Cajun Seafood (think Seafood gumbo with Ramen noodles and egg).  

The Gator Balls app was delicious!  The BBQ peel and eat shrimp was very solid as well.  

Me and a friend split the Gumbo Ramen and the Grilled Scallion Noodles.  Both were very solid, however if you get the Scallion noodles, get an app or side with it. 

Cool atmosphere, friendly staff and full bar."}
{"text":"Probably won't be back. Service was poor - we had to wait 20+ minutes for a table even though there were several tables open when we arrived. Hostess seemed like she had no clue what her job entailed. Appetizer took almost 30 minutes and was lukewarm upon arrival. Entree was ok but nothing special - I've had better takeout from fast food restaurants."}
{"text":"Get the cauliflower!!! Please people!! LoL, this was a great restaurant! From the decor and design, to the staff and the FOOD! I will definitely be back! And they stay open later than some in the area. You will only have small plates on the later menu, but it was so worth it and affordable!"}
{"text":"This place rocked. Stopped for lunch. Had fried crab roll for app. It was great ask for white sauce to go with it. Had Cajun gumbo ramen for entree. Two of us had it and we both enjoyed it. The atmosphere is really cool, neat and clean. The staff was very nice and friendly. To top it off only spent $35. Try it you'll like it"}
{"text":"I have Wu 3 stars just because the flavor of what I got was bland as hell. The corn and potatoes were good but I got something spicy and it definitely wasn't. The staff and management was amazing! I also got a sake sangria and it was good too! They just need some better seasonings. Ohh yeah and the bread pudding was good. It had goat cheese in it which was surprisingly good. I'd definitely go back and just try something different than the platter thing."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is pretty good. Service was very good on a Thursday. The food was good. The drinks were a little on the sweet side and the old fashioned especially so. Over all a good 4. Definitely a try if you like new fusion."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience here. The decor is fun, the service was prompt and courteous and the food was well-seasoned. I so wish the beignets came with sauce, but they were tasty without it. The manager Sung is also very accommodating and down to earth. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place and was hoping for a delicious Asian-Cajun fusion, but it sadly missed the mark. 

We arrived at 11:30ish on a Saturday morning. Now, I only state the time because we were literally the only couple in the restaurant for much of our meal, but our waitress rarely checked on us. She was nice when she did show up, but we were often left waiting on refills. 

The ambiance was decent...some of the decorations are very cute! But the air conditioner condenser dripping all over our table wasn't the most pleasant thing in the world. 

I didn't really see any cocktails that caught my eye, but my wife had the sake-hurricane mashup thing. It sounds like a craft cocktail (god knows it's priced like one), but it just tasted mediocre. It was like a drink at a crappy vacation spot where it's pleasant enough, and it gets you tipsy, but you're not particularly satisfied. I had a beer, although the waitress had to run back to the bar literally three times to give me information about the rotating beers. It would've been more convenient if she had been better informed, as I was curious about other selections but didn't inquire about them because I didn't want her to have to check on them, too. 

On to the food. We started with the kung pao cauliflower, which is supposedly a signature dish. It was very thickly fried, which absolutely overpowered the cauliflower. I love cauliflower and was rather disappointed because I basically got mouthfuls of batter with each bite. Then we moved on to the togarashi tuna roll. This was actually the highlight of the meal. The roll was light and delicately balanced, and the goat cheese complemented things better than I had anticipated. For our entree, we decided to split the crawfish boil with the fresh jerk sauce. Now, this might have been my oversight...I've had lowcountry boil before, but the shrimp was already prepared. This crawfish was...not. I'm a little squeamish when it comes to my food, and the crawfish weren't deveined. I honestly will admit I don't know if crawfish are SUPPOSED to be deveined, but staring down the digestive tract of a mud insect isn't the most appealing thing in the world. The sauce that accompanied it was supposed to be hot but simply tasted like butter. It wasn't spicy whatsoever. Corn and potatoes were good. The whole boil was like $15, which gets you about 15 crawfish staring at you. Again, I'm sure that lowcountry boils vary from place to place and that peeling the food is normal, but it's really not for me. I could've gotten past this if the rest of the meal had been good and the sauce had been actually seasoned, but all of this together was too much. 

We unfortunately won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very nice place. The entrance looks like I'm going into a casino. There is a host opening the door for you. Wasn't as busy as I thought for a couple days later after their grand opening. The food is good! Crawfish was easy to peel. Crab legs was yummy too. It could've been better for the price. Both comes with sausage, potatoes and corn. Very yummy! They have like 10 different flavors you could pick from! I chose this Cajun something I forgot but I was delish! And I like the idea they put the sauce on the side to dip and not all over the seafood. Less messy. But there's also light seasons over the foods. . My fiancé got the Raman and poke bowl. I didn't try it but he said they were both good! And he's used to be a chef so if he say good then it's good . Our waitress she was very nice and great at her work. Thank you. It's about $$$ price range for the seafoods. But other entrees is decent price. I'm glad we have something like this in charlotte! I will definitely be back to try other items on the menu! They have a good variety on their menu!"}
{"text":"After having BBQ overload visiting NC we decided to go for some sea food. I found Wu's Cajun Sea Food on Yelp and was really craving a seafood boil.

The place itself is pretty cool looking although it looks more Asian than Cajun... I guess it's some kind of Asian Cajun fusion.

Service was great and our server was super friendly and helped us decipher the menu and how the seafood boil worked. We both got a boil, I got mussels and my girlfriend got the shrimp. You also can't mix and match like do a pound of mixed seafood which sucks. We also ordered drinks and an appetizer. 

For the appetizer we got the cauliflower which was amazing! I'm not a fan of cauliflower but the way they prepared it was just delicious. I would come here to eat just that. Drinks were also very good. Where things fell short for us was the boil itself. Although everything was good and the sauces were good... there just wasn't much seafood in the seafood boil. It was mostly potatoes and corn and although I love corn and potatoes... there needs to be some seafood in there to justify the price. 

If I lived in the area I might come back and try something other than the seafood boils. Just cant justify spending over $80 and leaving hungry."}
{"text":"The pictures were all hype! I was very disappointed with my drink. I got the Hurricane but it really should have been called the Ice Storm because all it  really consisted of is shaved ice! You know how snow cones are...yep, just like that. 20% drink which I tasted no liquor and 80% Ice. For $13 I expected more. My friend got the Sangria ($9) which looked a lot better but tasted like your average sangria. I didn't taste any sake in it. We also got the dirty rice small plate ($4) and spilt the full pound of shrimp ($35) to share as the waitress said it was enough for two. It was if your sharing with someone who doesn't each much and I was so that turned out fine. In the bowl they give you a small sausage, two small corns, about 4 red potatoes and the shrimp. For our flavor we selected the Chilli Garlic. It tasted nothing like Chilli Garlic. The seasoning was in the juice in the bowl but it didn't stick to any of the items in there, so that was disappointing. The dirty rice was delicious however. The table tops were really high so I had to tilt my drink to just take a sip. The ambiance was cool however. Overall, it was worth a try but I have no desire to come back and visit. Overpriced and Over Hyped!"}
{"text":"Great spot - really unique dishes. Tuna Poke and Street Corn were our favorites but the Short Ribs and BBQ Shrimp were great as well. Highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Mediocre. Ordered the spare ribs, which were all fat and looked like dog food. The crawfish boil had no flavor. Best part was the appetizer: gator boudin balls"}
{"text":"Second time around. They were out of a couple beer choices. 

I was finally ready to try the Gumbo Ramen everyone spoke so highly of... :drum roll: Ehhhhh. Nah, not for me. I didn't like it.

My girlfriend went for the Cajun Fried Crab Roll. She loved it, I tried it and loved it too. I guess have to try around the menu and find what fits your taste. I knew I should've just stayed with the Tuna Poke...!"}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend on Wednesday evening during Queen City Feast Charlotte Restaurant Week 2018. As someone with New Orleans roots who's also  lived abroad in China, I was super excited to try to the Gumbo Ramen as well as experience this unique Cajun Asian Fusion. We were sat immediately by the hostess around 8:30, but after some obvious confused discussion between the hostess and servers of who would take our table, we still did not see the server (Chloe) until about 10 minutes later. This late response to our table was indicative of how lackluster our entire eating experience would turn out to be. After placing our drink and appetizer orders, it seemed to take forever for anything to arrive to our table. I didn't realize how long our appetizers (kale salad and tuna roll)  took until I checked the Snapchat picture* that I took upon arrival at Wu's and saw that 30 minutes had passed. I could excuse the appetizer wait if it wasn't for the fact that none of the main course food was actually good- the Galbi short ribs were chewy and under seasoned with the only taste coming from the dry rub on top; the ramen was also flavorless probably due to the fact that it did not have enough gumbo broth in the bowl, and the undercooked nature of the noodles made them soak up what little broth was in the bowl. Throughout this time Chloe was also grossly inattentive to our table- water was not refilled, old plates not removed, etc. And after our main course was cleared (by someone else), she arrived to our table with our check in hand (!!) before asking if we even wanted the dessert that comes with the restaurant week menu (I will note that the Apple Pie Egg Rolls are AMAZINGGG, can't say the same for the fried air pockets they call beignets.) As a former server, I try to be understanding of people having bad days, etc. but Chloe's demeanor and conversational, cheery attentive nature to the other high top tables surrounding us showed that we were the only customers she did want to be bothered with.
I was wholly disappointed by the entire experience, especially since I had been anticipating dining at Wu's. Definitely not worth the $35/person restaurant week price. This experience is even more disheartening for my girlfriend, who is a local Chef de Cuisine at a Charlotte restaurant that also participates in Queen City Feast; and happens to be familiar with the Bottle Cap Group and Chef Troy. 
*Pictures not posted due to Snapchat captions, but O captured seating time, arrival of appetizer, pictures of appetizer and ramen bowl for proof*"}
{"text":"PheNomMenal I absolutely loved my food and the service was amazing! I had the Cajun chicken ramen, ramen noodles made in house. Definitely will be back here!"}
{"text":"The concept of Asian Cajun is extremely unique and has so much potential. Unfortunately, the concept is poorly executed at Wu's. We got the crawfish fried rice which seemed like more of a gumbo since it was mushy and had a ton of sauce. You would never know it was supposed to be fried rice. We also got the gator balls which was the only decent dish during the entire meal. I got the curry chicken noodles as an entree which were just bizarre. The presentation was awful since the noodles came in a bowl that was huge yet the meager amount of noodles were placed on one side. The noodles themselves were drenched in a bland curry sauce. My friend got the gumbo ramen which is supposedly their signature dish. When the dish arrived, we thought they had brought her the wrong entree. There was no broth, just a sad heap of noodles in a thick and bland sauce. Our server was extremely attentive and friendly but sadly, the service was the only redeemable part of our dining experience."}
{"text":"I love WU's. We had a collection of tapas and  one sushi roll. The flavors were unique and fantastic.  The service (Megan) was extraordinary. We will definitely return to WU's."}
{"text":"Been following Wu's on Facebook since they first announced they were coming and recently moved closer to the area so last night I finally gave it a try.

We both enjoyed the sake sangria as our drinks.

For the food me and my guest shared the BBQ shrimp, the street corn, the broccoli and I ordered the gumbo ramen.  Everything was really good, but nothing was spectacular.  The bbq shrimp came highly recommended and they were good not excellent, we got 11 shrimp total, they come split down the back for easy peeling which is nice, there is bread to dip in the sauce which was flavorful. I loved the broccoli it was cooked perfectly for my tastes still a bit firm and crunchy and the sauce was good. We both enjoyed the street corn very much. I enjoyed the gumbo ramen, it was little spicy which is fine by me and had lots of crawfish and sausage in it, didn't see much okra but were a few small pieces, noodles were also good, my guest didn't care for the sauce on the ramen dish but I enjoyed it very much.

Our server was Laura the bartender we had a high top close to the bar, she was excellent, went over the specials, made some menu recommendations, and everything was delivered timely, she brought us water without asking which was nice and brought check promptly so we could get out quickly and sneak over to golden cow.

I will definitely be back to try some other apps and a boil in the future, we were very happy with our overall experience. Forgot the pics will take some next time."}
{"text":"One part seafood, one part Asian, one Cajun. It may sound like an odd combination, but it's a perfect fusion. 

So, real talk: when I first heard about this place I didn't think it would be a 5 star place for me. But honestly, I've been blown away each visit so far. 

Isabella was our server for my latest trip here and she was amazing from start to finish. For my two friends, it was their first time. She completely walked us through the menu and gave great recommendations. My must-order item here is the Kung Pao Cauliflower. Even if you think you don't like cauliflower, you'll love this. The street corn (miso mayo is delicious) and cajun gumbo are both solid. BBQ shrimp and sushi rice tuna poke are great, too. I am a huge fan of the Wu Boil. You pick your seafood and your flavor (7 to choose from). I like the Chunky Cajun. Each come with corn, potatoes, and sausage. I usually do the 1/2 lb of shrimp ($16). It's a good sized portion for me. I think the entire menu is reasonably priced. 

If you're not feeling the boil, the gumbo ramen is fantastic. They make all the noodles in house. One of the biggest surprises on the menu for me is the fried chicken sandwich. So good. I'm not a huge dessert person, but this last time we did get the grilled pineapple foster to share. Beignets, toasted peanuts, grilled pineapple, ice cream- yes. 

The She's a Lychee is my go-to cocktail here. I'm not an old fashion fan, but I did really like the Blacked Ol' Fashion. The House Cajun spiced rim is money. The Hurricane Kasa-Obake is not as sweet as it looks. Love that it has the coconut lemon grass sake in it. 

Parking can be a little tricky here as the lot is not huge. It may make more sense to Uber on weekend nights. 

Bravo Bottlecap Group, this is hands down your best spot yet."}

1714 South Blvd
Charlotte, NC 28203
Friday July 7, 2017 6:30pm

Wu's Cajun Sea Food is a great addition to the Charlotte Asian fusion restaurant scene. I was very impressed with their take on the fusion of Louisiana low country eats and classic Asian dishes. 

The menu has a wide variety of options and it took us a minute to really figure out our top choices. 
My friend and I decided to share a Clam Boil with Asian flavored butter, the BBQ shrimp and the Gumbo Ramen. Our table also ordered the Crab leg boil with Chili Garlic flavored butter, the Kung Pao Cauliflower and the Grilled Scallion noodles. 

Overall everything we ordered was delicious. My favorite being the BBQ shrimp with the grilled bread and the clam boil. Our Asian flavored butter was kinda chunky but added great flavor to our clams. The clams were also seasoned. The BBQ shrimp still has the shell on them but the sauce on them make up for the mess you make peeling them. I enjoyed dipping the bread in the remaining sauce. I was kinda worried that the portion on the boil would be kinda skimpy but I was mistaking. Our one complaint was the Gumbo Ramen. It was not my favorite. I'm not sure if it's the fact the noodles or made in house and I'm personally not a fan of homemade ramen noodles or it was the combination of flavors. It was also not warm when we got it so everything had kinda thicken up and there wasn't much of a sauce. 

I am very intrigued by the drink and dessert menu so I will be back to sample some of those items soon. 
The service, decorations and atmosphere is very nice. We got there right before they started a wait list and had an amazing booth in the back of the restaurant. Also the parking lot is tiny so be mindful  of that."}
{"text":"Wu's decor and vibe is very fun and a different  addition to the Southend scene of Charlotte. The dishes blend Asian zing with Louisiana spices and seafood.  I had the kale salad with tuna and the side of roasted broccoli. For some reason the seasoning on  both dishes were not strikingly solid to me-- almost felt it was trying too hard. The seared tuna also had dull flavor. Our waitress forgot my boyfriends drink and when we inquired about it (our food came out before the drink) she almost made it seem like he was being too impatient to wait for it-- we were both put off by that. Lastly, another waitress had some very  shorts on that showed way too much- it was very distasteful. Glad we tried it, but I will most likely not be back."}
{"text":"Loved Wu's! We got there around 8:30 last Friday night and were told our wait would be a little over an hour. We gave our cell number and ordered a drink at the bar.  About 25 mins later, we were called! Morgan was our server and she was excellent. She was very attentive and she also helped us narrow down the giant list we composed from yelp suggestions. 

Cocktails - I had \"She's a Lychee\" and it was so refreshing, not too sweet, perfect for summer. My husband had a gin gimlet (not much to say about that other than I hate gin).
For dinner, we shared:
Buttermilk Fried Calamari - SO good. The sauce with it is creamy with a slight kick - delicious.
Cajun Fried Crab Roll - Loved. It was spicier than I anticipated but that didn't stop me from eating it.
Grilled Scallion Noodles - they were good, but I wouldn't order them again. Maybe they tasted sort of bland because everything else we had was packed with so much flavor.
BBQ Shrimp - this was probably my favorite. Although, I really wish the shrimp came without the shell. The creamy worcestershire sauce was awesome and we loved dipping our bread in it. 
Street Corn - a tie with the BBQ shrimp. I have never had street corn that tasted so good.

The only downfall was that all of their draft beers were down while we were there, but other than that, it was a great experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Loved it! We had the gator balls, clam boil Asian style, the grilled scallion noodles, she's a lychee drink, and the wu's 75. Everything was fantastic but my favorite was the seafood boil. It was marked medium but wasnt spicy at all, so we def want to try something marked hot next time. We'll be back again and again. Really looking forward to trying their ramen and poke."}
{"text":"Myself and 2 other couples went to Wu's to try it out. We sat and waited for about an hour and a half to get our food after ordering. We never got it! When we were leaving another server stopped to ask us if we were ok. We said \"no, the food is not out as yet and it's been an hour and a half wait time.\" We waited by the door for the manager but she never came. We saw her as the waitress pointed us out to her because she needed to come over and address our wait time. Instead of coming over to us waiting at the exit, she went towards the kitchen in the back. 

Needless to say, we decided to leave and find food someplace else. It's a real shame because our waitress was very nice. BNo service recovery for our wait time. 

***Updated, Restaurant reached out to rectify our experience. Very much appreciated.***"}
{"text":"Unique and tasty combination of Asian, seafood, and spice! Some of the best street corn I've eaten in a long time- highly recommended.  The barbecue shrimp were awesome as well as the steamed items with choice of flavor.  Also nice fruity and refreshing drinks with a nice kick.  I would recommend and plan on visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"The asian sauce is amazing!! #musttry
Cauliflower was excellent!
Street corn was great"}
{"text":"Worst experience I've had in Charlotte in recent memory. We arrived at 6:15 and ordered at 6:30. I ordered a crab leg boil and my friend got a noodle dish. The noodles came out lukewarm at best and didn't have much flavor. My crab legs didn't come out, and at this point it was 7:15. I was told they would be ready soon, but 15 minutes later I still hadn't received them. We had somewhere to be at 8:00 so I told the server to just cancel them, and that we would pay for the noodles and appetizer and leave. She brought the check, and we paid and I left hungry. The 1 Star is for our server, she was very nice and very attentive and apologetic about what had happened, it was clear to us that this was an issue with the kitchen and not her fault at all."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really excited to try Wu's but unfortunately we didn't get to. We went in on a Saturday evening around 6:30pm, the restaurant was only about half full and there was a ton of staff however we were seated for 15 minutes without ever being acknowledged, we even tried twice to get one waitresses attention but she kept looking straight passed us. Finally we got fed up and left. Not the service you would expect from a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Yelp has failed me.  Although this place and food LOOKED interesting visually, the flavors and confused fusion style was a big miss for me and my entire group.

We ordered the fried calamari and fried cauliflower appetizers.  The calamari came in a weird sauce that really really tasted like thin nacho cheese sauce. I kid you not. The fried cauliflower tasted like Asian fusion popcorn chicken from chilli's or something..a very familiar and Americanized texture and taste.

For entrees, prices for the Cajun boils were ridiculous. $35 for a lb of shrimp?  We tried the Wu Blend flavor and it literally tasted like they boiled it and *lightly* sprinkled some Old Bay seafood seasoning on it. It was so bland and watery, I wondered if they used any salt or more than a pat of butter (margarine?)in this dish. 

We also tried the shrimp with the kimchi lemon(?) Flavor and the clams ($29?!) with garlic Cajun.  The clams were either not fresh or not cooked long enough, because more than half of the shells remained closed when they were served.  We asked them to recook them, and they came back very obviously manually pried open.  The sausage was dry and nobody ate the corn. The potatoes were ok.

I tried the gumbo ramen with the \"house made noodles\" and it was GROSS. The noodles were cold and the gumbo was bland. The tea egg tasted sour like it was soaking in vinegar, not kimchi. The charred cabbage was probably the most flavorful part of that dish.

Also, they don't have white rice, only rice pilaf. For an Asian fusion place, this sucks.

For 4 people with no alcohol, the bill was $148. We sat there trying to force ourselves to eat the food so as not to waste it. We failed, leaving half of our shrimp and almost all of the ramen untouched even though I was still hungry. Ate cereal when I got home.

Ashley our server did a good job.  The bad food wasn't her fault. She kept our drinks refilled."}
{"text":"Was an excellent low country boil. They also had 5 chicken legs for 5 bucks on Monday night. Service was great food delivered quickly and hot."}
{"text":"Tried out Wu's for restaurant week in Charlotte. Had the tuna roll as an app, the Gumbo Ramen and Burnt slaw for dinner, and apple egg roll for dessert, as well as a drink. The food was really great. Just enough Cajun heat. Service was good. Will definitely head there again."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!! Impeccable service, food was OUTSTANDING and the food came out quickly. We did the seafood boils with the noodle salad as an appetizer and everything we tasted was exquisite. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Whack and unprofessional .  Walked in. There was no one to greet us , so we walked to the bar and the bartender wasn't sure gave us a 5 minute wait which turned into 15 minutes and still no one greeted us. . So we left"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! I really enjoyed both of the meals that I have had here. I went with my roommate the first time and we had a great time and enjoyed quite a bit of sparkling sake! I loved the Wu's Seafood Boil with craw-fish with the side of lemon kemchi butter so much I insisted my boyfriend and I go two nights later! We tried a few different appetizers which were all wonderful. My personal favorites were the gator tail roll, the cauliflower, and the Cajun fried crab roll!! The food was so unique and there wasn't a thing at either dinner that I tried that wasn't amazing. 

I will say that the best part of this restaurant is the staff. They chose to hire college students that are not only adorable and super nice but they are hard working. One waitress even told us to try certain things because she felt like other items were not quite perfected yet since it was a new place, there was not a thing she recommended that was not mouth watering. We were very thankful for all of her suggestions. We had multiple servers come up to our table and ask if we needed anything and were truly on top of their customer service. This is an amazing spot and I know they are going to do well in Charlotte. I am looking forward to go back again!"}
{"text":"It pains me to write this review but I have gone to Wu's about 3 times now and it is very hit or miss. I've tried a lot of their dishes and I just don't think the \"fusion\" is working. The fusion of Japanese and Cajun is gross. It's like when Krillin tries to do a fusion with Piccolo. 

There was gravy on dishes that should've been dry. Everything tasted too salty. It was like a plot line from season 3 of Scandal because nothing made sense and it was all a hot mess. And by the end I just wanted to be rid of it like Shonda Rhimes did Columbus Short.

I also saw they got a pretty bad sanitation grade in the local news. So when I drove by today and saw the windows covered in paper I figured they had closed. 

I appreciate the adventurousness of the dishes. I mean nothing ventured, nothing gained. Also they had some good sushi rolls on the menu. Also the Kung Pau cauliflower was A BEAST! It's not like everything was bad. I'd just saying certain dishes were really disgusting while most others were just underwhelming.

Maybe they could be a really good Asian restaurant. Or maybe a really good Cajun spot. But the fusion of the two? Nah.

I can't believe Cardi B is pregnant! One of those dudes from the Migos is dating her and now she's toting a gutful of Migo. I think she's dating Take Off. Or is it Off Set? Sunstreaker? Prowl? One of those old Decepticon sounding dudes. Anyways... good for them. I hope her man gets his act together before he drags her down. Cardi B is a precious angel and we must protect her at all cost."}
{"text":"This is my staple place for Old Fashions. The drinks are good and the food is delicious. I'm cool with going solo and sitting at the bar or with friends. It's a value restaurant for what you get in ambiance, service, food and drinks. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Review update! I have been here many times.  The food has stayed pretty consistent for the most part (excluding the noodles).  I have my favorite BBQ shrimp standing strong.  The staff is always really nice, not the MOST attentive, but still very helpful, knowledgeable of the menu, and nice. 

One thing I took a star off for is the rise of prices.  Since opening I have noticed a fairly large increase in price for some of the menu items.  I can see after a few years, but within the first year?  I was really disappointed in that.  It is no longer budget friendly at all.  I spend at least $30 on myself alone.  The plates are so small, that it is necessary to order 2-4 items in order to fill up, so you're going to spend some money."}
{"text":"Wu's is slightly below average. I visited with a group of 9 on a Thursday night. The service was decent. Alex, our waitress was kind and managed to keep 95% of the orders together by herself. We're a tough crowd. That being said, I'm convinced the B team was in the kitchen. My calamari came out lukewarm. I sent it back and it came back at an appropriate temperature. My gumbo was also delivered less than fresh off the stove. More important, it was bland. The pictures I saw online looked so good. And in comparison (see my pictures), I realized mine was missing some key ingredients for gumbo: andouille sausage, okra, and likely spices. I feel cheated because they left out part of my meal. Considering I had already complained about something, I let it go.

The cauliflower was hands down the fan favorite. Great dish. I tasted a friend's kale salad. It had a spicy kick to it. If I ever return, I'd likely order this. Everyone who ordered a boil felt they were okay at best, lacking flavor. It was everyone's first visit and the general consensus was we should've gone else where. Fortunately, the prices were reasonable, so we didn't lose too much money."}
{"text":"Very confusing, the name and the outside looks like Chinese food, but then it says Cajun Seafood, I thought it would be more Chinese but once inside and I read menu , I was still confused . Menu was confusing so just had a salad, wedge salad which tastes and looked like an Asian salad, and the califlora appetizer , it was just ok . Won't be back . Wu's needs to decide what it's going to be , Asian or Cajun."}
{"text":"The spiced rim on the Blacken Old Fashion added a great kick to the drink, would definitely recommend it!  The Gumbo, Street Corn, and Fried Cauliflower were all delicious and would rank in that order just based on personal preference.  If cauliflower was made like that when I was a kid, I wouldn't have argued one bit about eating it!  The boil with the chunky sauce was a great ending to the meal.  Service was outstanding, and the decor inside really looked good.  I'll definitely be going back a lot, as everything was very reasonably priced, too."}
{"text":"I would give this spot 3.5 stars but will round up to 4. Here's the run down:

Service: decent but not great. There were a few times when I was looking around for our waitress to get a water refill but she was nice enough. 

Food: my fiancé and I shared the street corn and we loved it. He got the shrimp boil (chili garlic) and liked it but said he would get a different sauce next time. For my meal, I ordered the kung pao cauliflower and the BBQ shrimp. The cauliflower had good flavor but it was served at room temperature. I'm guessing they held it until the rest of the food was ready, but I wish they hadn't. I shared some with everyone at the table and they all agreed that it would've been better if it was at a warmer temperature. The BBQ shrimp was really good. I can't find anything that would've made it better. 

Our friends who ate with us ordered the shrimp boil with kimchi butter (he loved it) and the ramen gumbo (she was not a fan). 

My fiancé and I both agree that we will come back."}
{"text":"Crisp Thursday night and I worked up an appetite for some Cajun...and sea food. What better place than Wus and I wanted to know what all the Wuuuus were about. 

Pull into the parking lot and get an instant pop of culture from Wus unique style and I'm digging it. I sit down and my server ripped off a giant brown sheet to put on my table knowing I'm not here to mess around but to eat. I start my dinner with a cajun fried crab roll and some oysters. Rolls hit the table and as soon as they do they hit my mouth. Now I'm a sushi connoisseur and have invested some real time and money on sushi. I was not impressed and it may have been the goat cheese that threw it off for me so now I'm on to the oysters. Virginia oysters nope Carolina oyster nope some good ol Louisiana oysters. You can't go wrong with oysters, I'd just recommend a side of horseradish to spice things up. 

Seafood...check, now it's time for some Cajun. Get some crawdaddies with one of the hot seasonings and when I saw spicy Cajun seasoning I'm ready to sweat through my shirt. I dig into the crawfish the seasoning was good but the spice never showed, kinda like Cam Newton in the Super Bowl (saddest day of my life). 

I wouldn't go back unless it was for one of their all you can eat nights. Servers were great food not so much."}
{"text":"I honestly don't usually write reviews unless I have an absolutely amazing experience. I believe that these sights steer people away from trying a place based off of someone else's taste buds. But in this case no taste buds are required when eating the blandest food I've ever had. Presentation made me salivate and when I dove in to my mussels i found them barely edible. My husband had the over seasoned tune poke. Seems they need to focus a little less on presentation and a little more on proper seasoning. Barely touching our food our server didn't even ask us how everything was or if we were okay for a solid 15 minutes. Considering the place was barely busy for a Saturday night you would think she would have check on us after a few bites in to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. I work as a bartender so I am well know good service when I am given it and this was not. I wish I could remember our girls name all I know is her shorts were a bit too short for our liking. I understand what they are trying to do with the place I just think the bottle cap group fell a bit short with this one. I will unfortunately never be back and I will never get the $100 I spent there back!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Had to wait 15 min just for water. Had to flag down waitress to order food. Food came out an hour later. Couldn't tell what flavor their \"signature ramen\" actually was - neither gumbo nor ramen. The shrimp boil had a decent flavor. Overall, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Fun little place with delicious cocktails such as Sake Sangria and Hurricane. Calamari and roasted broccoli were very tasty."}
{"text":"Great food, good ambiance! Just don't order the 1 dollar oysters, they always have too much sand  in them. The WUs 75 is my favorite cocktail, and I love their tuna poke bowl! The boils are so good!!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why Wu's has an average 3.5 rating. We went for restaurant week and were impressed. We had the bleu cheese wedge, crab sushi roll, shrimp boil, and ramen gumbo, in addition to the lychee cocktail and old fashioned. My fiance said the ramen gumbo was a little too thick, but we thought everything was pretty solid. Service was great too."}
{"text":"This new restaurant I will definitely return to.  The service was great our waitress was very attentive and the food and cocktail were delicious. We ordered a crab boil, and shrimp boil. The only area of opportunity would be expanding the menu and adding a seafood platter. Currently you have to order each seafood boil separate. I left stuffed and had leftovers. The kids meal options were appealing as well, my picky 6 year old ordered chicken tenders, the options for sides were steamed white rice or broccoli. He chose rice, and it was good he actually ate the rice and took the tenders home. I would recommend Wu's to all my seafood loving friends and anyone that enjoy food with flavor. #newfavorite"}
{"text":"Yes! Yes! Yes! Came in and was seated immediately. Christina was my sever. She was very professional and honest when I asked her opinion. I can appreciate that, especially when the price differences were clear, she didn't push the higher one. It was strictly on her taste. I had the gator balls. They were delicious. I then had the crab roll for my entree and it was delicious!! The crab roll was spicy so if you aren't a fan of spicy, this won't be the roll for you. Everything was great and I plan to return very soon!"}
{"text":"Solid first experience. I love the idea of trying something new like Cajun/Creole.

We began with the gator balls. Boudin balls filled with gator, rice, and sausage. They were a good start to the meal. I wish there had been a few more for the price. 

We both got the gumbo ramen. It was unlike anything I have ever had. Very unique and delicious! The broth was more like a gravy and I enjoyed the soft boiled eggs in there. Seemed to be plenty of crawfish. I loved the portion for the price. $10 and I will have another meal off of it. 

The way they have redone the space is very nice. I love the decor!

Our waitress, Megan, was very kind and attentive. Great service!

I am on a drinking hiatus or I probably would've tried one of their cocktails. Next time!"}
{"text":"We love Asian food and we love Cajun food. Didn't know what to expect but this is a wonderful blend of the two and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great new spot in south end! Phenomenal customer service, drinks and atmosphere. It's got the stamp of approval (for the first time at least)

Fingers crossed that it doesn't go the way of other bottle cap group spots in town!"}
{"text":"My favorite thing on the the menu Will gave to be the poke tuna bowl. Omg it's so good. Like if I had this place down the street from me I would go every day. They used to have this kickass manager name Sung that works there. I mean they even have a a panda there. They let me pet a live panda."}
{"text":"I am giving Wu's 3.5 stars but I can't round it up to 4.  As Trey S. mentioned, the location, ambiance, and concept are great.  We were excited to have crabs after an event at Freedom Park.  Service was great and the food arrived in less than 15 minutes.  I have to agree, the portions are not congruant with the price paid.  Our dinner was a hefty $ amount (1 adult, 1 child).  The Wu Boil with two crab leg bunches cost $30/lb. - market price I guess.  I also ordered the Crawfish Fried Rice ($6) and the Fried Gator Roll  I enjoyed the rice after adding some of the signature kimchi lemon butter sauce.  The gator roll was simply okay, no big deal.  Although delightful, the serving of wine, Freak Show Cabernet (this was the only Cab available), really left a LOT to be desired.  I almost yelled out when she placed the glass on the table but I was able to show restraint!  Dessert for us was the apple-ginger pie egg roll with vanilla ice cream.  This dish was scrumptious and the price was right.  Overall, I enjoyed the service and ambiance at Wu's but would have enjoyed much more food and drink for the price."}
{"text":"Wu's was pretty good and I can it doing pretty well. I've actually liked most of the restaurants that have been at this location. The only downside is the parking which is rather small and then South Blvd tends to have some traffic between 5-6 on the weekdays. The decor is very nice and it has a nice vibe to it. We decided to sample a few things instead of getting a whole menu. 
1. Kung Pao Cauliflower was good, not as amazing as I've heard but good and definitely a lot so share
2. Shrimp toast was different not bad but probably wouldn't order it again
3. Crawfish Fried rice was really good 
4. Cajun Fried Crab roll was also really good these 2 were the best things we ordered
5. Shrimp boil with Wu's seasoning it was good just didn't seem like a lot of food 
And for a drink I ordered the She's A Lychee which tasted great just wasn't strong at all actually I don't taste any liquor 

All in all I love the Asian Cajun Seafood concept and I will definitely be back to try some more things off the menu!"}
{"text":"From the food to the atmosphere this place is amazing!  Definitely recommend getting the Kung Pao cauliflower! Our server Bella was great and had so many fabulous recommendations everything she told us to get was to die for! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to this place with \"the girls\" on a early Saturday evening 11/4. I ordered the hurricane drink it was really good. I ordered the bbq shrimp it was De-lish-us!! The shrimps were not peeled and it was in this good sauce that you can sop up with this garlic toast that they serve with the bbq shrimp. Yuuuummmm!! I also had the Cajun fried crab roll. I don't typically eat rolls (sushi). It was also the bomb. I ordered the bread pudding. It was really good, I wish it can with a nice sauce or something."}
{"text":"For the pricepoint, this is a very solid restaurant. The calimari and bbq shrimp are among the best dishes I've had in Charlotte (seriously). I took my boss from Philly to this place to show off the food scene in CLT. Only knock is the so-so gator roll we had. Service, decor, and creative menu are top-notch. Will continue to recommend and revisit on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars is because of my husband's gumbo ramen.  The noodles were not the best and it wasn't very flavorful.  I'm really surprised that this is one of their signature dishes.  I had the shrimp boil and it was amazing!!  Service was also great too!  Very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here and so did my boyfriend! I wish I could remember the waitresses name it began with a J. I dont wanna mess it up! Anyway as soon as ww sat down we were promptly asked if we needed drinks and given a thorough explination of the menu.

I ordered the crab pot ( low country boil) with the spicy garlic sauce. It was delicious!! The corn and potatoes and Crab were all seasoned and cooked perfectly! My boyfriend asked for fried oysters alone and our waitress made sure to accomodate! They were awesome... We enjoyed every bit of our meal and our waitress was absolutely wonderful! I don't say this often but... We will definitely be back! Well worth the money!"}
{"text":"FALSE ADVERTISING
Our friends at Wu's Cajun Seafood lie. They advertise \"All you can eat crab legs\". Let me clarify what they mean by this. An average snow crab leg cluster consists 4 legs and a claw segment attached to a central lump. It should weigh approximately half a pound, have a nice orange-red color and is best served hot. Wu's considers an order of crab legs to be two legs attached to a diseased, cancer ridden mass with a green to brownish green color served ice cold. They also consider \"All you can eat\" as just a suggestion as it took 25 minutes to bring me a reorder of the same leukemia crab they served the first time. 
Our server Chloe was wonderful and apologized for the delay. (I am herby exonerating her from the crimes committed at this restaurant). The manger on the other hand has a great deal to learn about customer service. His Norman Bates appearance (Dexter for you youngsters) was matched by his smartass attitude. When I told him I just paid $40 for 4 crab legs his reply was, \"Well it's all you can eat\". I replied \"Well you need to be served first\". 
Needless to say we won't be going back, and our waitress Chloe (not creepy man) removed the charge from our bill. The patrons at the table next to ours commented on the pathetic state of the crabs as well as the long gaps in between orders.
NOW FOR THE REAL FACTS.
Crab Leg prices are still sky high. Any place that offers all you can eat crab legs is doing two things. The first is they are using \"B\" grade crab legs. These are the small clusters that are missing legs etc.
The second is that they intentionally get reorders out slow so you will order more drinks and eat less crab. 
Do yourself a favor, take a pass on Wu's"}
{"text":"Disappointingly bland food. My table tried the gumbo ramen, Asian flavored shrimp boil and Kung pao cauliflower. The only item with any flavor at all was the cauliflower, which was actually pretty good. The lunch entrees missed the mark. The gumbo had barely any spice for a \"Cajun\" dish. The shrimp boil was nothing special and didn't taste cajun or Asian for that matter."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch to Wu's to try to get a different feel than just the regular lunch and dinner experience. Some things went great, others did not. At first, we were disappointed that Wu's did not have a regular brunch, so it was basically just their lunch menu. But they have some great selections and said they were going to start a special brunch menu soon, so that took some of the sting away. Speaking of sting, they were out of bloody mary mix and didn't seem to know about putting fruit juice in champagne, so both of us and our brunch dates didn't have the usual brunch-drink experience either. Hopefully they will get this aspect a little more together. The food was awesome. From the  Crawfish fried rice to the Crawfish boil, everything food-related was awesome and service was excellent as well. We will soon give them another chance for brunch and maybe try dinner as well."}
{"text":"I would say everything besides crawfish is good. The corn is sweet and sussage is juicy. I also ordered cajun gumbo. It's good. But the crawfish is steamed and dip into seasoning, so that makes it less inmersed with seasoning. The other thing is it there are only a few crawfish of one pound, maybe 10. And they ask for 15dollar for that, which is beyond the price other restaurant ask for. So three star"}
{"text":"My friend Ebony and I finally made it after days of saying we were going to try them out. The Asian feel is right on point, from the panda outside on the patio, to the ninja,and geisha themed bathrooms. Uniqueness was the reason behind me wanting to come here the concept of Cajun Asian seafood had me quite intrigued.

Service is the first thing i would like to speak on. Definitely wasn't the best, the fact that we already thought our waitress/bartender Alaina was quite rude just added to everything else. Ok time getting my drink to me,but when it came to the food the simple fact that their wasn't but a handful of people there and it took darn near 30 minutes before i received my food was a little nerve wrecking to me.

Gave them 3 stars because i do love the ambiance but the service drops them down to a 3. The food was tasty , and my drink was ok the best part of my drink was the cookie straw in all honesty. I was expecting so much more but didn't get that . Affordable far as the food unless you are getting crab legs etc the prices are to be expected. The chicken fusion bowl i ordered was only $8 to $9 and was very filling. So the big question for myself is will i come back? Im still on the fence. They have some improving to do far as service and wait time for food. Nah thinking they are not for me!"}
