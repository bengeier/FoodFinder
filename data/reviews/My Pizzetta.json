{"text":"For a super fast pizza it's actually really good.  Great for families who loath typical \"fast food\" and need to grab something quick between activities."}
{"text":"Great pizza, not your typical pizza. This place serves thin crust pizza mad in a type of fire kiln. The seasoned bread sticks are a must."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, super fast service! Thank you!! Yes, it's more expensive than your $5 cardboard pizza but you get what you pay for. I don't mind paying a little bit more for great quality pizza. You guys are awesome!"}
{"text":"After spending 2 weeks in Italy last year, I can tell you that this is the \"real deal.\" Great pizza! Fresh ingredients, real Italian brick oven baked - it was so hard to drive home without digging into the boxes. Do yourself a favor and run to North Royalton for some of the best pizza you have ever had! Friendly service and the finished product is out to you in minutes. It is a drive thru, so take out only. It's near the MetroParks, so pick one up, stop at the park, grab a table, and eat it while it's fresh. Truly amazing!!"}
{"text":"I was very pleased that leafy green salads are also available! I found it a nice break from just iceberg lettuce. Was very healthy and tasty!"}
{"text":"The pizza is very very good. Best in the N. Royalton/broadview area by far. But the whole setup isn't right. It's drive thru pizza which mean you wait in your car for a minimum of 10 minutes. Longer if it's busy. It's hard for us to order from here as often as we'd like for that reason alone. If they changed to a call ahead or expanded in some way it would be the only pizza we ordered."}
{"text":"Great quality and great selections! We like it because everyone can order a pizza they like and not settle for what everyone else is having. You always get the pizza you like! The drive thru if pretty fast and your pizza it hot, my son eats it in the car on the way home, we love it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place but there were too many menu choices to take in for a drive through. And then I felt rushed because there was a car behind us. My own perception obviously, but I don't like to feel rushed when ordering food at a new place. 

It is really cool to be able to build your own personal pizza and get it in a few minutes while sitting in your car... but... They burned our pizzas, the crust was not very good, and for about $20 I could have gotten a lot more, better tasting, not burnt pizzas elsewhere."}
{"text":"I had high hopes on this place after reading all the reviews.
Either it was a bad day or the weekend staff was different.
No qualms with the service and convenient DRIVE THRU but if the pizza itself is bad, nothing else can justify it.

Ordered a veggie large which was supposed to be a 12' but seemed like a lot less than that.
The crust was all burnt on the sides and the veggies(charged extra for each toppings) were meagre. I don't know if the toppings were added after or before the pizza was in oven because none of the toppings were toasted.

Overall a bad experience and definitely not a repeat although it is nearest."}
{"text":"Ordered the Margherita, it was really good. The side salad with their house dressing, it was a yummy honey balsamic. I will for sure be going again. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Pass this place on my way to work every day and finally decided to try it. OMG soooo good!! I just got a normal pepperoni and sausage but I got the spice red sauce, totally took this pizza to the next level. The cheese to sauce ratio was perfect and the crust was light and crispy. I wasn't sure how the whole drive thru situation was going to go but Service was surprisingly quicker than I expected. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Read about it in the paper and have the day off today to go get car brakes so u was hungry. I heard you could get a pizza into three minutes. Wow what great taste and you could definitely tell its like Italy with its great crust. I went for a simple cheese and mushroom with onion and oh my gosh it is phenomenal. I will be back."}
{"text":"I'm going to up my review for this place, because it really does deserve 5 stars despite by qualms with the drive through arrangements.  I still hope that they set up a parking area so people can sit and eat, or even stand and eat.  Best pizza that in the Broadview Heights/North Royalton area."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Got a small with olives/mushrooms. Perfect for a little pizza car date :)"}
{"text":"In observance of National Pizza Party Day, my coworker and I decided to give My Pizzetta a try. 
We split a large (8 slices) on wheat crust. She got pepperoni and I got tomatoes and basil. She was a champ and ate all of hers, I shared a slice and have one leftover. 
The wheat crust option took away most of my pizza eating guilt/aversion (being health conscious) and was delicious! 
The drive thru and previous businesses at this location made me skeptical and hesitant to try this place, but after seeing them on New Day Cleveland and a good review from my sister, I'm glad I gave it a try. Definitely will be heading back there the next time my pizza craving kicks in. The staff was super nice and it was easy to order on the Slice app."}
{"text":"Great small-town business with fresh ingredients. I was hesitant to try them at first because I was looking for a sit-down place and My Pizzeta only has a drive through, but after giving them a chance I had no regrets. The service was quick and the ownder was very kind and welcoming. The pizza was delicious and they offer various selections and crust options, including white, wheat and gluten-free crusts. There is something for everyone here. I enjoyed the fresh mozzarella and basil. I will be going back and recommending this spot to my friends!"}
{"text":"I love hot pizza with tasty cheeses, and a perfect crust: not too thin, not too thick, and not greasy. This fit the bill perfectly with a wood-fired crust to boot. You can customize to your hearts desire or keep it as simple as you wish. Super fast, tasty and hot. What a gem of a place this is. Wish we tried it sooner. We are definitely fans!"}
{"text":"I have gone to My Pizzetta about 10 times now.  I made a habit of going directly after my golf league every week.  Pizza is a very subjective, however there are a few universal characteristics that are difficult to argue against.  My Pizzetta has them all.

My pizzas were made with extremely fresh tasting ingredients.  I am partial to the pineapple and feta cheese.  I love the fact that they put the feta on after they blaze the pizza so it doesn't destroy the composition of it.

Due to the nature of their service model your pizza will always be piping hot.

Their traditional sauce is tasty and a bit sweet.  I used to denounce putting sugar in pizza sauce until I realized it was delicious.

The basil pesto sauce (known as pesto by most) is fresh and traditional.  I have yet to have a pizza better pesto pizza.

Room for improvement - One time they burnt the bottom pretty good which was unfortunate ( I do like a little bit of char but this was burnt).  Also, it is expensive.  That being said I would rather pay $10 for a high quality pizza that fills me up than pay $5 for a hot n ready that inevitably fills me with regret.

I suggest giving My Pizzetta a try, it is worth the risk."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place so many times and finally had a chance to try their pizza.  Cute little shop and great pizza! I ordered online a custom mushroom, black olive and wheat pizza and the Hawaiian pizza. Both were delicious! The crust is thinner but still has a nice bite to it.  The toppings and sauce tasted fresh. This is definitely a unique experience compared to other pizza places in the area, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Garlic bread was like eating rubber so hard and not at all chewy 
Pizza --- 
Nothing great abt it .
When I called to complain that m not happy with the pizza they said they r busy now  and they hung up the phn . 

Will never go back again !!"}
{"text":"Was pretty excited to try this place. 90 second pizza is convenient but would it be good?!? We waited in the drive through line with anticipation. Ordered pizza with cheese, bacon and black olives. Yummy"}
{"text":"Two words. Rip off!
Way too expensive not worth it at all 
You would have to spend $40-$50 to feed my family at there ridiculous prices. 
So many better choices. Would not waste my time or money. 
Concept I guess okay 
We tried it once not enough for two people tasted horrible and burnt. We threw it out should have taken it back!!!
Can't imagine they last in business very long"}
{"text":"My Pizzetta is AMAZING!!!! I love their whole wheat crust and the customization available! It is a little bit of a wait at the window, but that's to be expected because the pizza is made fresh to order in a fantastic oven. The taste is impeccable!!! We have visited this restaurant many times in the past month and will definitely be returning!!"}
{"text":"Thank God I don't live closer to this place. I'd be here WAY too often. 
Drive through pizza, made fresh to order in minutes, and IT'S GREAT. 
Now they've got cookies, subs and salads, so they've round out the menu."}
{"text":"We saw this on the local news.  We drove 20 minutes from the East side and would do it again!  We are originally from Chicago so we hold high standards on our pizza selection. We all ordered the 10\". Had some left overs that will not go to waste. Mine had the pesto sauce, my husband had the white Parmesan sauce and our son the traditional. Great brick oven taste. Since it was drive thru only we simply went down the street and enjoyed our lunch at a local park."}
{"text":"A drive thru pizza place! I ordered a thin crust with pineapple and banana peppers. The very nice and knowledgable staff added a few red peppers. Done in about 5 minutes and I loved it."}
{"text":"I love the concept but delivery has issues.....I have been 3 times now and twice had issues with the concept of calling out number as way of ordering toppings for the pizza in drive thru...3rd time just called out ingredients and things went smoother.

The pizza is excellent thin crispy crust which was unusual for this Clevelander but still really tasty.  The topping are top notch and the garlic bread was awesome.....

I would definitely recommend and will be back again."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for a while and finally had a chance to check it out and it lived up to the hype. I like the dive thru concept and the pizza is made of great fresh ingredients.  One of my new favorite pizza places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I had high expectations after reading the reviews so I waited for a day when I was really hungry and ordered 2 10\" pizzas. I have no idea where the other reviewers have been going but It can't have been here. My pizzas were cold, dry, chewy, and rubbery crusted disasters.... even worse than store brand frozen pizzas. I wasn't expecting Anthony's Coal Fired or even Eddie Cerino's but these were honestly the worst pizzas I've eaten since I had one from a vending machine back in the '80's, and that one was crispier than these tough suckers. There are a lot of very good pizza places nearby so it's hard to see how this one will or should survive. The drive-through gimmick is no substitute for good food."}
{"text":"Took the back route home and out of nowhere this glitzy little pizza place caught my eye! It is America's First, drive through, made-to-order, pizza restaurant! I got a 8\" pizza (wood fire grill) with black olives, white parm sauce and banana peppers for 7 bucks and change. Very yummy, and I am thrilled to see something NEW and NICE in Royalton.  It appears strictly drive through, and also offers salads and gelato. First of many visits to this pizza start up!"}
{"text":"The last time I was here was my last time ever! Their was a woman cooking the food and taking the money which always scares me. Even worse was how dirty her jogging pants were it was disgusting and if that wasn't enough when I brought my pizza home there was a hair in my fresh mozzarella! This really makes me sad because i loved their thin crust with seasonings..."}
{"text":"I decided I wanted to try pizza from somewhere new for a change. I stumbled upon this place on yelp. 

This pizza spot has a drive thru which I thought was really unique. You can place your order in the drive thru or you place your order over the phone & can pick up the pizza at the drive thru. I like that!

I ordered the half sheet of the pepperoni & sausage pizza. The pizza was on the thinner side which I can appreciate. It was loaded with toppings, that's for sure. The pizza was pretty good. Not the best pizza I've had though. I'm not sure if I would drive out of my way for it but if I'm in the area I'd get it again."}
{"text":"Love this place and the pizza !! The side salad was super fresh and did not taste like preservatives. The pizza is wood fired and very delicious ! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Just can't say enough good about this place!. It is the go to place for my wife and I when we out  doing things and it's getting near dinner and want to take home a fresh tasty meal. We had a green pepper and onion  small wheat pizza  and tasty as ever . Thanks!"}
{"text":"I saw this on the news and had to try it.  We traveled from North Canton for an event, it was well within our plan.  Super friendly owner, great guy and great concept.  Pizza's we very good, great sauce and crust.  We got the Sunday special, so it was very reasonably priced.  The owner really makes an effort and made sure everyone was happy.  If you want a high quality pizza that is done quickly, this is the place.  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Always friendly service. Always great pizza and fresh toppings. I LOVE that they have gluten free crust! It's drive thru, which is very convenient. They do not take call ahead orders, which is not so convenient. You do have to wait an average of 9 minutes for your order, but they are making you fresh pizza so a wait is expected. There are a ton of unique ingredients and fun combinations that you can make."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious.  Perfect crisp crust, wood fired taste and homestyle sauce, not stingy with the cheese either.  I love the drive thru idea and it is the best wood fired fresh pizza you can get in the area.  Very, very good.  I treat myself often."}
{"text":"Great pizza if you are in a hurry. By the time you order and pull up to the drive thru window it is almost ready. Simple, fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"This was just plain delicious pizza. I ordered the 1, 4, 9, 13 which is just a medium pepperoni pizza. I'm pretty sure the guy who gave it one star down there is a rival pizza shop or just reviewed the wrong pizza place because there is absolutely no way you could receive a cold pizza from this place because this place . The ordering system is a little different but the pizza was well worth it and I will definitely return again"}
{"text":"My go to place for fresh, local pizza. Great customer service and the pizza is always hot and fresh."}
{"text":"The pizzas are the best in the area! I have listed a few additional things that I that I like that are not on the menu

- Pink Pomodoro or Vodka type sauce 
- Stuffed crust with garlic and cheese
- Goat cheese
- Eggs
- Cacio e Pepe Pizza

Click \"Useful\" if you agree"}
{"text":"I really love this place. Like....really, really. Really. 

I don't just crave pizza anymore...now I crave My Pizzetta pizza. It's not only that it's super convenient (order by app on the go, pick up pizza by DRIVE THRU minutes later!), but it's dynamite good. Thin, but still chewy, and generously cheesy. I already always wish I could eat pizza everyday, so delicious and fast drive thru pizza now pretty much consumes my every waking moment.

6 stars."}
{"text":"Ok this was tough. I wanted to give this place a three and my boyfriend said two. Since there isn't an option for 2 1/2 stars and I'm writing the review, I won. I think the concept is great. Drive-through pizza basically. Who doesn't want fast pizza?!

They don't take orders over the phone, it is strictly order at the window. You can pick between dozens of toppings and create whatever pizza you are in the mood for. We had a coupon for buy three, get one free. Clearly this place is a one pizza at a time dealio because four took FOREVER. 90 second pizza....psh! When we finally got our pizza home, it was good. That's it, just good. Nothing special but perfect for what it was, \"fast\" food pizza. 

Here's where it got weird... On their flyer tacked to the pizza box, it said \"Nominated top ten best pizzas in suburban Cuyahoga county, southwest.\" What is that? Not voted, nominated. That is an oddly specific flyer and it pretty much just says that you are possibly one of the best pizzas in Strongsville and part of North Royalton. Not something I would be advertising but it did get a chuckle from me. So hats off for that."}
{"text":"Finally made it to My Pizzetta after reading an article about it in the Plain Dealer.  It didn't take two minutes to get the pizza, but it was done in under eight minutes.  I ordered a BBQ chicken pizza with red onions.  It was made fast, fresh, and hot.  I had to wait a few minutes to let it cool off, but the pizza was fresh and delicious.  I'd definitely like to try some other toppings.

The wheat crust was chewy and delicious.  The toppings were fresh and very flavorful.  I like a little more cheese on my pizza, but it was still really good.

This was the first time in my life on planet Earth that I purchased drive-thru pizza!  

Recommend!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I live down the street from this little spot! Had the pizza, breadsticks, and calzones... so delicious. Will be back regularly!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and a great business to add to North Royalton. The owner was very kind and willing to help you choice what was best for you!"}
{"text":"What a genius idea! A drive thru pizza place!? When I first heard about it I was skeptical...for what? I don't know because it was just great and super quick too! They have the option of wheat crust which makes for a bit of a \"healthier\" option when it comes to pizza. I went with the  spicy red sauce and that was just enough kick. They have a lot of toppings to choose from. I stuck with the traditional pepperoni, sausage, mushroom and of course, banana peppers. I will definitely be back to My Pizzetta in the near future. It's times like this when I say to myself, \"if I only would've thought of this first!\""}
{"text":"I tried this place after getting a flier in the mail. Highly recommended. Great crust....various sauces and it was quick and very tasty. I will def order again"}
