{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. This used to be the place I would bring family/friends when they came to town but that is no longer the case. The portion to price ratio is not in line anymore. Used to be able to order a large and not be able to finish it in one sitting and now I order the large and I'm left hungry. They also serve all day breakfast and for a whopping 12 you can get 2 eggs 3 measly pieces of bacon and a sliver of sausage. They claim the plate comes with \"salad\" which is just a wilted piece of lettuce with a sliver of tomato. Overall wouldn't recommend this place anymore..."}
{"text":"I went to pay the cashier and coulnd't understand French. So my friend who is fluent translated for me. The cashier then said, \"Oh should I speak in Chinese? Ching chong ching chong ching chong.\" Do not patronize this racist establishment."}
{"text":"Save your money and time. 10 min walk from the place and it took them 2 hours for delivery. It's crazy how some businesses really don't give a shit about service anymore"}
{"text":"This place has probably the best poutine in all of Montreal!!! Every time i'm back in Montreal, I have to come here for their famous poutine :D I tried their hot-dogs this time, it's just so so, if you are looking for good hot-dogs in Montreal, go to Decarie Hot-Dog."}
{"text":"Personnel stupide et incompétents... Erreurs sur la commande à la livraison et très compliqué de recevoir ce que nous avions commandé. Conseil: vérifiez votre commande avant de payer le livreur. C'est quand même une des meilleures poutines du quartier."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE i call this restaurant for delivery minimum 2-4 times a week ,i spend minimum 15$-30$+ on some bills and i give minimum tip of 4$+ and this is the CRAP SERVICE WE GOT:  Monday June 6 2016 i ended my work shift and came home to realise i forgot to defrost some meat..I was starving and was in no mood to cook ,i had a co worker friend with me who was hungry too. At 3:13pm i rang up Mont-Royal hot dog and placed a order for : trio all dressed Le Mont-Royal 10\" submarine comes with fries and a 7up drink.A young woman's voice answer and took my order. I had a friend with me and he chose a Large Italian poutine only. I had a few incidents in the past (2 total)with this restaurant once they forgot the drink of the trio and once they sent me a  wrong order! I live about 8-10  minute walk from this restaurant so you would think delivery would be fast...Well it is not the case..remember i placed my order at 3:13pm and it was going on 4:00pm and the order still had not arrived.  We were STARVING BY THEN....ONE HOUR + WAIT,i got pissed and called back the restaurant to ask if our food was coming or not. The waitress sounded like she just wanted to get rid of us and she says on the phone with a attitude :\"The delivery on its way \"then she hung up on my face...  4:15pm  still no food,it has been by now a 1 hour wait for a submarine trio with a Large poutine..I call back and demand to speak to the owner/boss/manager because i find it unacceptable to wait 1 hour for food.The waitress refused to let me speak to the owner telling me he was busy every time i asked ..I told her i am busy too..i am waiting +1 hour by now for food that will cost me 31$ and be COLD!!!  No apology,no humanity,she did not give a shit.During the conversation with the waitress refusing to let me speak to the owner/boss/manager i was standing on my balcony finishing up the call when the delivery guy shows up,i refused the order because it was COLD!!!!  I told the delivery guy sorry i wanted warm food and 1 hour wait for cold crap i told the guy bye bye and told him to tell his boss i ordered from PIZZA MEGA .I got my sub trio and a regular poutine for my friend,cost me 23$ +tip and the delivery took -33 minutes!!!!! The delivery guy was polite,food was warm,tasty and fast DELIVERY!.  So Mont -Royal hot dog is not a place i suggest you order delivery from.Unless you like cold crap and TERRIBLE SERVICE.  I would have expected at least the restaurant to call me back,offer a freebie,or even say we are sorry and we know you are a 2-4 times a week delivery customer ,we will fix this issue..but i got nada,niet,zip...  So you lost: a very good customer  your reputation your self respect 31$ for the meal and the tip!  Pizza Mega got my business now."}
{"text":"Mon late-night snack par excellence.  Le gratin kraft du trash-plateau s'y tient. Pourtant, toujours une bonne bouffe, matin, midi et fin de soirée. Ils livrent quand même tard alors c'est cool, même si t'es paresseux ! Poutines, burgers, pizzas, plats maison. Amazing soupe aux légumes et cheese.   Un bon diner deluxe qui ruinera pas ton p'tit change. Vas y essaye-le !"}
{"text":"Classic Quebec diner in the middle of the plateau. Very friendly service at 2PM on a random Tuesday, I suspect it may be different when very busy (i.e. over brunch, late night, etc.).   Their hotdogs are pretty much just regular diner quality. Supermarket buns and hotdogs, and the steamies \"all dressed' were just what you'd expect.   As far as the poutine goes, the gravy was a standard pre-made mix but acceptable (not too salty, not too sweet), and the cheese was of the right kind (salty cheddar cheese curds) but certainly not fresh. Not only did they not squeak, but they also were a little hard with crisp outside - suggesting they were at least from a day ago or had been hastily thawed. The fries were excellent - fried twice, and crispy.  All in all, it did the job. But I would never seek this place out."}
{"text":"Prenez une bonne pouffe de graisse en entrant.  C'est du fast-food, c'est certain. Aucune prétention ici. Je prends souvent les sous-marins, qui font mon plus grand plaisir, mais pas mal toute la malbouffe est bonne. Ouvert tard pour ceux qui boivent en plus.  Service correct, bouffe graisseuse et choix typiques, un bon classique sur la rue Mont-Royal."}
{"text":"A hot dog is a hot dog. I never walked in to order the food to be honest with you, but the hot dogs were good..."}
{"text":"Seems I may be above the average on my rating, so I'll post a few points to explain;   The ingredients; namely the fresh crisp tomato and onion on the Greek salad, plus numerous over sized olives (were 5 left and too good to waste - so will be added to another day's lunch - maybe today).  The Poutine: Also above average, above average fries (which could stand alone without gravy or cheese), dark brown flavourful gravy which was surprisingly NOT too salty - a big plus. The cheese, a little dense and not overly salty, but did lack a high amount of squeak - this topic could have a whole section itself so without further digression).   Quite an edible Club Sandwich (on whole wheat - thanks for remembering). Quality white meat chicken - not too moist, not too dry. Bacon that was on the fatty side, but overall made for a nice unit. Two vinegar pickle rounds and an almost Sauerkraut style coleslaw. Subbing a pretty decent Caesar salad for the fries does add a small extra charge.     These all apart from my friend's endorsement (he eats there about once a week or more on average, and is more strongly opinionated than me). He also brings his family. A shout out to the server for patience with kids expending their various levels of energy. Even more so 'gold stars' to the patrons sitting in the back dining area for simply lifting their eye brows. Thus allowing for a fun filled dining experience and a bunch of full bellies."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were with friends in Montreal for NYE weekend. My friends were craving to eat diner-food and found this joint since it was close to their AirBnB. You'd think that the restaurant had a variety  of hot dogs on the menu based on their name - sadly they had just two options. While our friends were eating their breakfast (Canadian bacon, eggs and toast), we went to a cute little cafe around the block. We wrapped up before they had finished their meal. We decided to go inside this restaurant and wait for our friends at the bar. I noticed that they didn't finish their Canadian bacon/sausage. When I asked them why, they suggested that I take a bite. I knew that was a bad sign. I didn't want to take a bite, especially if they did not like the sausage. However, my boyfriend did take a bite. My boyfriend, who will eat literally anything  even said that the sausage was not edible.   We ordered a Michigan styled hot dog because we were curious if it'd be delicious since the name of the place was Mont Royal Hot Dog. It was nothing special. It was just a boiled hot dog overloaded with meat sauce.   In a city full of great restaurants, I'd suggest skipping over this place."}
{"text":"Placed an  order with Mont Royal pizza at 7:47pm. Delivery guy showed up at 9:25pm with the pizza.  I repeated many times with the lady on the phone that i only wanted mushrooms on 1/2 the pizza. When i opened the box after the driver left there was a pizza with only mushrooms on 1/2. This was clearly not what i said or repeated when talking to the lady on the phone.   When I called back she informed me that they were very busy and that she made a mistake but would not replace the pizza instead offered me a small pizza. I told her i didn't want a small pizza and according to \"Nick\" the manager whom i was never allowed to speak to that was all i was getting. This lady has the worst attitude I've ever heard from someone dealing with customers. When i repeatedly asked to speak to \"NicK\" i was continually shot down and was told if i wanted to speak to him i would have to call back at 10pm. At this point i hung up.  Followed with my roommate calling this Lady and she proceeded to tell him that it was my fault for the mistake and that she repeated back to me what she was writing down. She didn't do this and repeated what i had told her requesting 1/2 no mushrooms. The lady then proceeded to tell my roommate (Who doesn't eat mushrooms) to just eat the other half. NEWS FLASH you put mushrooms on the ENTIRE pizza there is no other 1/2 to eat with out it.  When my roommate told her she had a bad attitude after she swore at him for calling back and requesting a new pizza. She then told him \"Whatever\" when he told her that she had to fix the pizza and send a new one.   We have been ordering from from this place for the last 6 years since we moved to Montreal and have ordered it every time we want pizza. It was an amazing place to order from and soooo delicious. Over the last year specifically this place quality wise has gone downhill. I use to eat two slices and be full now that doesn't do it at all. I saw that this place has been around forever but with the customer service and quality i can't see how they will be around very much longer."}
