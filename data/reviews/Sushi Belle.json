{"text":"Decent price, good value, quick service. A bit too much rice in rolls and some not quite tight enough.  Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"I've been a customer for Sushi Belle since it first opened next to a hairdresser and a gas station and will remain loyal until ither I move away to another country or die, but this place is the best. Angel is an amazing woman and a hard worker, she makes awesome sushi and I recommend it to anyone who's looking for a great meal at a great price. We love you Angel."}
{"text":"This review is based on a single take-out that I brought home. 

Got 22 sushi pieces for $9.99 + tx.

These pieces were vegetarian:
Avocado roll
Cucumber roll
Cucumber, lettuce, pickled cabbage roll
Avocado, lettuce roll
Cucumber, lettuce roll
Avocado, cucumber, lettuce, tofu roll

To me, this was a meal that got me to the next meal; meaning, I was just hungry at the time and this did its job by keeping me nourished for a couple more hours until my next meal :/.

Everything just fell apart - I ate it with chopsticks - the rice's texture felt like it was cooked with too much water. I got bored of eating cumcumber very quickly. The soy sauce seemed watered down. Didn't come with enough ginger.  Had I known the small portion of ginger, I may have asked for more.

The sushi are prepared when you order it - I suppose that is a good thing.  I went on a weekday evening, and there was only 1 person working, and so, it took a while for the queue to move along.

As a first time visitor, I did not find the ordering process was client friendly - there is a sign that says 22 pieces for $9.99, but, there is no listing of what is in it.  When asked what that is, the person behind the counter shouted \"It's written there!\" (and scared the crap out of me for shouting) and pointed - All I saw was a tacky coloured Bristol board with pictures of sushi and words and exclamation of specials, but which pic is which?! It was just neon colours and numbers on an excessively large board.

The decor was an eye sore, but seems to be typical when it's a Chinese run non-franchised sushi place.

Anyway, don't think this would satisfy your sushi craving; only ended up here because MooSoo sushi down the street was closed at the time :(."}
{"text":"As much as I love this place - the owner is amazing and you can't beat the prices - I am lowering my rating for inconsistency. Most of the time is is GREAT but  every once in awhile there are problems with the rolls; either they are not tight enough and fall apart when you try to eat them, or they just don't taste as good as they usually do. I go very often, though, so maybe it is just bound to happen here and there. 

That being said, for the price, it is definitely worth checking out! It is closed weekends and closes pretty early during the week, so make sure you find time to stop by after work!"}
{"text":"This is my ultimate hidden gem sushi bar. It used to be attached to a gas station/hairdresser (don't ask!) but now, due to demand, have moved to a MUCH better location near DQ.

Pros
- CHEAP (how's $10 for 22 pcs for ya?)
- Tasty sushi with quality ingredients (spicy sauce & that crunchy crap is highly recommended)
- Made to order (not like that sushi shop garbage that's been sitting in the fridge all day)
- Lots of Hello Kitty swag

Cons
- 1 table to sit (this is pretty much a takeout place)
- The owner isn't Japanese (As I walk out she wishes me a happy Chinese new year and gave me a candy...d'oh!)
- UPDATE: This last con was really just to deliver a joke. Flavor and service are the only languages I care about when it comes to restos and Sushi Belle is fluent in both :)

Always call ahead (20 min) to give the lady a chance to prepare so you're not stuck waiting"}
