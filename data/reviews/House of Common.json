{"text":"Amazing brunch, coffee and wine spot, all in one!  Don't let the small size of the restaurant or menu fool you--the chef packs some BIG flavours in his dishes.  Probably the BEST pancakes I've ever eaten...my husband had to stop me from eating them all (it was his order after all), and i loved my 'spicy' bene rosti. Go and be charmed by the excellent service, dreamy sweets, and scrumptious savouries. We'll definitely be back and hope to brunch here for many more memorable meals to come. Thank you chef and staff."}
{"text":"Fantastic brunch. Warm and inviting staff. New local favourite. Worth a visit. The home made green tomato jam is outstanding."}
{"text":"We were anticipating the opening of House of Common for sometime after the closing of Humble Beginnings in the same location. We finally made it in on Saturday for brunch. We found the service to be friendly, and attentive. The Americano and Iced Coffee were both very tasty. For food, we both ordered the Common Breakfast, and were very satisfied. Portions were generous, and all items were prepared with attention to the details of flavour. Even my fried eggs were uniquely savoury- eggs don't have to be just eggs! The home fries were herbed to perfection, and the Mennonite sausage brought the sensation of being home on the farm. Well done, House of Common! One suggestion: perhaps procure your bread from a local bakery."}
{"text":"Best brunch spot in the neighbourhood, the service is super friendly and welcoming. Great food and drinks, would recommend for any locals or visitors of the junction!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! It wasn't too crowded and the food was delicious! The chief substituted beef to roasted veggies as I don't eat meat.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, server was great and attentive, atmosphere was inviting and chilled.   Ordered the pastrami on rye and got the HOC soup with it. It was perfect for such a chilly morning in TO. The coffee was great too, and the server kept refilling it.   The house made pickles were delicious and not too vinegary.   Couldn't fault anything here. The music was also super chilled out and tied everything in really nicely."}
{"text":"On vacation in Toronto.  We were in Downtown but decided to venture out a bit.  Probably 20 min from Downtown, but worth the drive.  Perhaps the best food I've had in this city.  However the thing that topped the food was the service.  We were catered to, as if we were family.   I had a sandwich on a jalape√±o bagel with an over easy egg, and other complements I cannot remember but I can tell you that it was a recommendation of our server and it was legit.   You would be sad to miss eating here if you visited, and if you are a local, you need to make this place a common stop."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing!  The food was delicious, the service was perfect and I would definitely recommend it.  The server was very attentive and she even came to the rescue when my 3 year old son was choking.  We loved it!  You've gotta check this place out!"}
