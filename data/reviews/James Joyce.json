{"text":"This place is such a great place to go for a great beer and a bite to eat.  I always love the food and the staff is amazing.  Like Chris C. said the bread pudding is amazing! You also have to try the Guiness Ice Cream.  It is not what I thought it would be at all.  Very nice and smooth."}
{"text":"This is my go to place.  Whenever I have a lunch or dinner meeting this is where I suggest and go.  Whenever I am incredibly homesick for Ireland this helps me to feel better.

Ann and Gerard concern themselves immensely with the standards of quality in the food, drink and service and it shows.

I have been a patron here since they opened and I love this place more each time I go; not once in all the years have I ever received bad service or bad quality food.

The pour of the Guinness is the best outside of Ireland.

Unlike other \"pubs\" in this city that have merely jumped on the Irish bandwagon, the Joyce understands the meaning behind the words Offig An Phost and that they are not just Irish words to be displayed to give off the air of authenticity.  The knickknacks and artifacts decorating the pub are truly Irish and special.  

My Irish family and friends all leave the Joyce agreeing that if you want a bit of Ireland in the Heart of the West the only place is the Joyce."}
{"text":"Went there for my friend's birthday. There was a big group of us and I truly appreciated our server. After we were paying however, our server named Una deliberately said that she did not get enough tip. And told the birthday celebrant that her friends did not give enough tip. It was appallingly rude for someone to say so. To appease her, we gave way more than we should have given her. My friend celebrating her birthday is a server herself and understand how terribly disrespectful our server was. Our initial tip was even 3/4 of the value we paid for , for the food. Calamari was sub par as well. Never going back. Never."}
{"text":"The blackened salmon salad is to die for. Even though it was supper rush hour we had friendly and efficient service."}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal. From the hostess to my waitress,  the staff was excellent. (Thanks Edel!) I was greeted and settled into a nice table right away. My waitress came promptly and took my drink order. The bar got backed up and my drink took a few minutes to come,  but Edel came by to let me know that my drink was only going to be another minute before I even had a chance to wonder where my drink was. The waitress knew the menu really well and helped me make my decision.

I had the bacon wrapped dates and the guiness and steak pie. Instant food coma!  The food was prepared so quickly and came to the table pipen hot! ( fresh from the oven hot...not warming lamp hot). And the food was so so so good.

Not only did my waitress come to ask me how I was doing,  but so did the hostess. I felt so well taken care of.

This place is perfect. Good food,  good drinks,  great menu, AMAZING staff and a warm and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"James Joyce has an authentic Irish feel to it, right down to the prices. It feels like they're dealing in Euros here and you only have Canadian money.
Other than it's too pricey, I like the place. It gets popular at supper time, filling with business guys on their way home looking to grab a scotch or a Guinness after work. They can probably afford it.
But this is the best place in town to get a Guinness. It's poured properly and it tastes as fresh as you can get around here.
Good place to stop in for a drink while on Stephen Ave."}
{"text":"My man and I had our first Canadian date here, and although I had a wonderful time, I have to admit that it was mostly due to the present company, and not so much the venue and food. Don't get me wrong -- the food is fine, just nothing I'd rave about to a friend looking for a Calgarian recommendation.

Our waitress was very friendly (but so is every other Canadian in the world, it seems), and made some recommendations for us. We opted for the Halibut and Chips with a side of curry, as per our waitress's advice, and the Blackened Ribeye Steak with a salad of greens on the side. The food arrived promptly, and we dug in.

We started with the greens, which were dressed with a berry-citrus vinaigrette of some sort. Not great. The Halibut and Chips were tasty, although I much preferred my malt vinegar over the side of curry. The Halibut was light and flaky, with the filet inside delightfully maintaining its moisture without being inundated with frying oil. Not bad, if I do say so myself! Although at $18 for 3 filets, I would expect at least this much. Note: the fries/chips weren't very good. :(

I tried a bite of my hunny's steak, and though I give it ten points for being wonderfully tender, I have to take back points for being overseasoned. It was drenched in steak sauce of some sort, and any natural taste the steak might have had was completely overwhelmed. I've never had a $25+ restaurant steak this poorly done.

It's worth mentioning, however, that I did like the setting of the place -- definitely very Irish pub-ish, laid back and fun. :)

The verdict:
food: 2 stars
service: 4 stars
price: a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Great place - I held an event there and they were awesome and very helpful.  A great irish pub with a wonderful staff. Go for a drink, food or throw a party there."}
{"text":"Great place to have a beer after work. Definitely a step up from most \"Irish bars\".  Bartenders are attentive and friendly, prices are reasonable and the food is great, best burger on Stephen Avenue Mall. 

Live music from time to time is nice, it's a favorite place to go."}
{"text":"I really wish I could rate this higher, but what a disappointment. this place was.

The Inside  is nice and traditional looking Irish pub with a very nice decour. I wanted to try the sheppards pie ( I'm always a sucker for shepp pie) $12. 
What a rip-off!  It had about 5 ounces of meat sauce that looked like it came from a can and the rest was mostly potatos. Tasted like.... umm....whats a good word....... not good!  The portion  was so small it would'nt have satified a 5 year old. 
I also had 2 pints of beer.  $8 / pint !!!  WTF?, am I at a night club or what??!!   I guess I should have looked at the price first.

This place is a total rip off and the service was horrible to boot!
Avoid it at all costs if your smart!"}
{"text":"Remembering this place from one of our guided Calgary Ghost tours, a friend and I decided to grab a quick lunch here. It's built in the old Molson TD bank - most of the original decor (like the mosaic floor) are still present and the Victorian feel gives this place a cozy feel.

Since there was a conference going on, a lot of the restaurants down Stephen Ave were pretty busy - including James Joyce. Luckily we were able to snag a seat, unfortunately it was on the corner of the bar inside.

I understand that it was busy, but it was about 15 mins before our drink orders were taken. I scanned the menu, nothing really caught my eye and we both settled on the Halibut and chips (you can't go wrong with fried food right?).

Our food actually came out fairly quickly and it looked tasty. The coleslaw was pretty awesome (house made sauce) and the cabbage was still crisp. The halibut was nice and flaky and really, you can't screw up fries.

I wouldn't mind coming back and sitting on the patio on a sunny afternoon, I don't think the busy conference gave them a fair chance to shine."}
{"text":"Awesome variety of traditional Irish meals. Large selection of Irish whiskey and beers. Might be the best selection of whiskey I have seen in a local pub. Decent service. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came here as a first visit on vacation.  Really great service - excellent food and a relaxed holiday atmosphere.  Will come again.

Between us we enjoyed a well \"pulled\" pint of Guinness &  - Irish coffee.  My husband had the shepherds pie which was served hot and was very tasty.  I had a black bean burger - which had a nice spicy \"kick\"  they offered gluten free option to their burger buns and were also happy to switch out for salad."}
{"text":"Food was ok... not the best service though, place was almost empty and we still had to spot where server was to get another drink... music was really boring, slow and you could barely listen to it... zzzzz, good thing we were with friends otherwise we would have left right after eating."}
{"text":"I was looking for a venue not too far from my hotel where I could drink some beers, and have a decent meal in a cozy atmosphere. What is better than an Irish pub to get all of these?

I have nothing to say about the beer, but the food was not really good. I know it's a pub, and not a big restaurant, but usually these pubs are doing some decent food to eat with your awesome beer. My plate was really below average! As for the service, it was OK. I think it was a bit slow as we were not a lot in the restaurant, but it was always done with a smile, and for me, this is also very important after a good day of work.

Good place to go if you want to drink some beers with friends, but I would recommend that you go eat somewhere before (or after)."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most expensive pubs you'll experience in Calgary.  After a beer or two and something to eat, you'll be asking James Joyce himself to write you a poem about being broke. 

This pub's location along Stephen Ave makes it very accessible and a central place to meet up with friends.  But you want to spend the whole night here, because if you bank account is like mine, your night will come to a quick end. 

For me, the main draw of the The James Joyce Irish Pub & Restaurant is that you won't be able to find a single TV anywhere on site.  Which means that, assuming you put your phone away, you'll be able to have a conversation with the person you came have a beer with.

As with any irish pub, I recommend you try the Sheppard's Pie.  I'm always a sucker for Sheppard's Pie."}
{"text":"Okay pub for after work drinks.  Appetizers were very meh.  Definitely better pubs in Calgary."}
{"text":"I was there last July.   Food was quite good.  Service was excellent.  Place it great, but I've never seen such swarms of bar flies in a bar before.  Not a few.  LOTS.  They need to clean up their act or their ratings are going to slip into the tank.  Here's hoping they get their act together."}
{"text":"I had two completely different experiences at this establishment. The first time I came here was during the start of summer and I would have given it one star. The second time was for a work function and it was considerably better...
Now, why a pending one star you ask? Let me share with you my night, months ago....
After meeting up with friends downtown we decided to go for dinner. There was a sign out signifying a great deal \"A choice of two different pre-set menus for a 4 course meal, plus a drink\" we accepted this deal and went in! 


We order the specials (And let me make a note: the two main choices were cream of mushroom ravioli that's stuffed with more mushrooms - my nemesis, or a cream of tomato rotini.) I chose the tomato. After we all finish our starter salads that come with the deal, we are told ....\"We are all out of tomato sauce so you'll be having the mushroom main ok?\" Yeaaaah... We are told, not asked.
We tell her no, sorry if I knew of this before I wouldn't have chosen this deal, can we substitute for anything else? She goes to ask and comes back and points out another mushroom dish stating this is the only other option.

Getting a bit frustrated we say ok, then nevermind, I guess we'll just pay for the salads/wine and go... Then they say \"no you have to pay for the whole meals, even though you're not going to be eating them and even though you're leaving. What? Why? 

So we say no, but we have no problem paying for what we did have. The manager then says \"well then ill have to make the server pay for all four of your four course meals! Seriously? We only ate 4 tiny starter salads and had a glass of wine each! But she wouldn't budge and well we left very unhappy. 

Second time around for the business event was completely different. The private space was snug but filled with cheeses/meats/fruits and veggies, all quite good and I was surprised how nice and fast the service was too and have to say it was an enjoyable visit. 
So there you have it! The good and the bad, all wrapped up in a 2 star review."}
{"text":"Great decor and authentic music, but food was lacking.  The Steak and Guinness pie tasted like tepid Campbell's stew with a puff pastry dropped on top.
I would back for a drink, maybe"}
{"text":"My experience here was not great, based (surprise surprise) on all the same reasons that my fellow Yelpers have already mentioned. The reason however that I AM going to give these guys 3 stars as oppose to a measly 2 is solely based on the fact that they served me some of THE best nachos that I have EVER had. James Joyce's 'Irish Potato Nachos' are TO DIE FOR and the best part is that for those of us who can't eat wheat, we can actually enjoy this version of nachos!

Jalapenos, onions, peppers and cheese on waffle fries, along with sour cream & salsa... trust me, your tongue will thank you. Your arteries, not so much, but hey, you only live once right?!?!?!?"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic burger with irish beer,Smithwicks,Kilkenny. Great old fashioned pub atmosphere. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"We went into the pub around 3pm and ordered from the dinner menu which is mostly identical to the lunch menu.

The pub was empty when we arrived but started filling up when we were done one hour later.

The atmosphere in this historic building is nice and the menu features some traditional food like Irish Stew and Shepard's Pie.

Prices are ok and the food we had was good."}
{"text":"Went here last night I will start off by saying the atmosphere is nice. The beer was very good. My friend had a bud light pint and I had a Kilkenny, both pints rang in at $9.10 each. I thought $9.10 for bud is a tad expensive. Pretty average for the Kilkenny.
Food wise I ordered the fish and chips based on another review I read about this place. The fish came out of a package was probably placed in the oven and reheated. It was not battered. All in all a forgettable meal that was over priced. I won't come here again as there are plenty of better establishments to give your business to so give this one a miss."}
{"text":"I had been on their patio in the summer, and it is quite decent. Had their calamari salad, and it was alright. I would order it again. 

I was there again a few weeks ago and I made the mistake of ordering a burger. I had burger on my mind all day and when I was invited to James Joyce, I figured I'd order a burger! I did not even want to look at anything else on the menu.

Anyway, the burger was a sad disappointment. It was quite generous in size, but the patty was overcooked, dense and dry. It was so dry, that even the sauce on top of it could not salvage anything. I can't remember what type of burger it was - it did have jalapenos on it - but it really does not matter because it was that unmemorable.

The pub itself is okay. It is 'cleaner' or 'brighter' than other Irish pubs, which I appreciate. It was fairly packed too, and the crowd seemed like mostly professionals."}
{"text":"Great burgers, onion rings, salads, just good pub food served for a fair price and very fresh tasting. We sat outdoors and it was just a lovely lunch. So nice we returned there another day."}
{"text":"This is a great Irish Pub on Stephen Ave. 

My old hang out spot on Stephen Ave used to be the Bear & Kilt but as life has gotten busier the lack of service available became less appealing. 

So I was on the hunt for a new place, low and behold I walked into the James Joyce. There are downsides to this place so I am going to get them out of the way first. It's a bit pricier, not expensive but not the cheapest, mostly Pint's of Guinness are $8.95 (boooo). The only other thing that bothers me is that most of tables have stools or benches without backs, it gets a little tiring. But that's all. 

The food is really good, very reminiscent of my time in Ireland, and that is a good enough memory to go back there. The onion rings are super crispy and wonderful, the curry, boxty, stew, just great classics that the James Joyce does super well.

And dessert, can I recommend anything more than the brownie! No restaurant has ever been able to figure out the brownie to ice cream ratio, UNTIL NOW! The James Joyce had lost two stars from me for extreme Guinness price until I had the brownie, that gained a star. 

Also try the French Press Coffee, it is nice a strong but with such a lovely easy to drink smoothness, it's glorious. My new favourite evening is to go to a show at the Epcor Centre then stop at the James Joyce for a Coffee and Brownie. What more could you want in an evening? Okay maybe you could go to Ireland, that would be a lovely evening. 

Sorry Bear & Kilt, I'm going next door."}
{"text":"We were at James Joyce Irish pub for a birthday gathering on a busy Saturday evening.  I'm not usually one to go to pubs, but since it was close to St Patrick's Day, it was only fitting to check out this place!

Atmosphere: 4/5  Located conveniently on Stephen's avenue downtown.  Parking was a bit difficult but we managed.  The pub itself has a great and unique atmosphere.  Good noise level, interesting decor.  Very versatile whether for a larger group gathering or dinner or drinks.  Because we were a bigger group, it was nice to have a separate room area to ourselves.

Food: 3/5  I had the salmon salad that was on special; overall good.  Portions were a little smaller than I expected.  I didn't explore the drinks menu as I don't usually drink, but it seemed like those who did enjoyed their drinks.

Service: 2/5  Unfortunately, I was somewhat disappointed by the service.  To be fair, it was a very busy night; however, we did have to wait a long time to order and had much difficulty flagging down the waitress repeatedly.  We were told while booking reservations that there will be a 18% service charge for a large group, but when this was tagged onto our bill, it still felt undeserving for the service received.  I am sure this may have been a once off occasion, however I do hope to have a more positive experience next time

Price: 3/5  Reasonable

Overall: 3/5  Overall I enjoyed the very unique and fun atmosphere at this pub, however the service can be improved esp given the 18% service charge for a large group.  I like the versatility of coming for drinks or food with big or small groups and would consider trying some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"I didn't expect much and I was not disappointed.
A tasty lamb burger and salad had a pleasant sauce and filled the bill for an inexpensive lunch outdoors.  Nothing special by any means, but nothing to complain about.  It was odd that the lunch menu is the same as the dinner menu, but I suppose that the limited pub food selection had to fill both sides of the menu card."}
{"text":"Food and Drink: 2.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Overall experience: 2.5/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

I thought coming here would be a great experience, heck it's an Irish pub after all! Alas, I was very disappointed =(

My bf and I came here for lunch and we decided to sit outside on the patio since it was a nice day. I can't say much about what it's like inside and the decor except that the patio tables were ghetto covered in a plastic table cloth and was a little too small and cramped for two people. The service was pretty good, our waitress immediately greeted us when we sat down and presented us with menus. She was nice and patient with us especially when I couldn't figure out which beer to try until I finally decided to ask for some recommendations. One complaint though was that after we got our meals we still needed cutlery and it took us awhile to hunt down a server- I believe our server in the midst of a shift change. When we couldn't find our server we asked this one woman who looked like the manager or owner standing by the entrance for cutlery and she had the most confused kinda b!tchy look on her face until she realized what we needed. 

Their beers on tap is limited and consisted of a few domestic beers and one or two other ales. Nothing unique or 'Irish'. I highly suggest NOT coming here for drinks after work or to relax because not only does the selection suck, but it's hella pricey for a pint ($9). In fact I don't even remember them printing the price on the menu.

The lunch menu (which is very similar to their dinner) consisted of your usual pub fair such as salads, gourmet burgers/ sandwiches, fish and chips, shepherds pie, pastas, and steaks. The sandwiches/burgers are pricey starting at about $13 for what you get. I decided to try their 6oz Apple and Brie Burger ($14) topped with danish brie, cinnamon plum port chutney and apple slices. It was accompanied with their home cut fries which were like giant potato sticks (about twice the size of your usual fry). My bf decided to try their Beef & Guinness Pie ($11) which consisted of sirloin tips of beef in a rich Guinness gravy topped with a flaky pastry. 

Overall, the food wasn't as good as I thought it would be especially the Beef and Guinness Pie. When it came out I was like WTF because there was this huge fish shape flaky pastry on top of a dinky dish of stew. My bf had a hard time eating it because pastry flakes kept falling on the table and his lap, and he wasn't able to get both the pastry and beef in one bite. The gravy had a weird, off putting taste and it just didn't measure up to the one he tried at another pub. Definitely SKIP this dish! My burger on the other hand was decent, but very plain and boring. The bun was too big for the burger and the so called 'apple slices' turned out to be one apple slice and was too thick which made every bite texturally odd. My only favourite thing about the burger was the chutney which I wish there was more of because it had a wonderful sweet apple flavour that complimented the beef very well.

Once we got the bill we were shocked at how much we spent between the two of us (two meals and two pints) cost us about $50 including tip. James Joyce Irish Pub is very pricey and the food and drinks aren't all that great or unique either.

I will not be coming back and I suggest you PASS on this place to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"Don't bother with the food; Irish pubs are places for drinking, not eating!

If you stick to the beer, you'll be alright.  The prices are very high, though."}
{"text":"This is a nice pub.  The waitstaff is friendly and prompt.  There is a good beer selection.  The food is better than the average pub-fare."}
{"text":"We had the crispy chicken breast sandwich with the Irish whiskey mushroom soup. Also the Irish potato boxty. The sandwich had great flavor but was a little dry. The soup was amazing! The boxty was very good. Good service. We would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"It was a warm night,  and we'd been out an about and still ready for some fun.  The Hostess at the  the front  patio sold us.  She was upbeat, friendly and professional all at the same time.  We were never rushed even though we were the last patrons on the patio.   I love this place, and will go back again.   Especially for the tastes of whisky.    I was with a friend who'd never had whisky before and he especially liked the Tullmore Dew.   And the flight of beer was a generous pour in graceful curved beer glasses and gave us four truly Irish beers to try.  We asked for the Jalapeno burger without Jalapenos and got it exactly that way and the French fries were crisp and delicious.  So were the dried ribs.  But he service and the atmosphere won the day .  From the waitress who helped us determine which whiskies we were tasting to the young bus-girl who was helpful and quick and efficient, the folks were fine!   But I loved the hall to the bathrooms.   Beer  labels in a large poster style,  the Irish dance costume, various beer giveaways across from very funny sketches of beer tasting entertained me, too.   The only drawback was the crowd outside the patio on the street.  But they were kind of like streetside entertainment for someone with a sharp Irish tongue.  Oh yes, and the music was truly Irish.  The James Joyce is my new favourite place to go for a wee one downtown!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a pint and a bite to eat. Had the fish and Chips which were done perfectly. Really a nice place. Beers were what you would expect out of an Irish pub. 

Great find for my first visit to Calgary"}
{"text":"Terrible service. 
Below average food. 
Sunday afternoon about 2:30, the place was NOT busy at all.  There is a large black podium at the entrance to the patio that would indicate one needed to wait to be seated. I waited. I watched as 2 different employees passed me twice each.
   I went inside. As I stood near the door and the bar, 2 different waitresses walked right by me and didn't make any eye contact or ask if I needed anything, there was NO sign to indicate what to do or where to go. Do I sit? or do I wait? nobody's speaking to me, nobody's looking at me.. now I see a bartender that isn't paying attention to anything so essentially he's ignoring me too. I take an open table on the patio. The blond waitress (frumpy one...) walks past me twice and doesn't acknowledge me at all. Finally, after about 5+ minutes of being here, another waitress I haven't seen before comes to my table and wants to know if I \"need something\" Yeah, .. how about a menu, a drink, some lunch and a little SERVICE !!!!! I didn't say that and I was polite (flat, but nice) and asked for a menu. I got an iced tea. It was sweetened - I'm diabetic and don't drink sweetened drinks. The iced tea was $3.35 OUTRAGEOUS I ordered some potato pancake with stew stuff on it.  Sounded good on the menu and was decent - except for the meat. The chunks of meat ( 5 in the entire meal) was overcooked, hard and dry. Essentially inedible. the carrots and potatoes with the gravy were tasty. 
        All in all, the staff is composed of poorly trained, incompetent morons that can't even SEE a customer standing somewhere, not knowing what to do or where to go and they have no idea how to be polite or handle their job. 
These people are in the Food SERVICE business and have no clue what's going on around them.  
This place was recommended to me by a local hotel and I have already told the hotel to STOP referring people to this place because it discredits THEM when a customer has a bad experience. 
 Go somewhere else for better food and better service. 
This place fails on all points."}
{"text":"Convenient and friendly place to stop after work or heading to a show at the Epcor Centre (Jack Singer Concert Hall). Very busy at dinner time, which makes for slow (but friendly) service. A bit expensive, but paying for the location. Food is good."}
{"text":"Go for the atmosphere, beer, & dessert!  The first time I visited I had the curry chicken boxty.....Dear James Joyce....NOTHING about curry is Irish!  I was disappointed.  By far the worst boxty ever.  The second visit I had the Ploughman's salad.  I was expecting a salad, right? Nope, it was more like the fixings of a sandwich.  It was good but just confusing on how to go about eating it other than with my hands.

They redeemed themselves with dessert.  The Guiness brownie is to die for!  It looks like it is made with dark chocolate so you expect it to be rich & maybe a little bitter.  It wasn't at all!  It was moist & decadent.  The only suggestion I have is that they serve it with vanilla bean ice cream, not just plain vanilla ice cream.  The New York style cheesecake with berry compote was excellent, also.  I would have licked the plate if it wouldn't have embarrassed my company!"}
{"text":"Lovely, lovely lunch.  Best, absolute best Mushroom Soup ever... Secret: Jameson's!  Wonderful atmosphere, great food and service fast and cheerful.  Beer and drinks all good."}

{"text":"Definitely an Irish feeling place. Irish music and Irish waitress. We tried the sampler as well as Guinness steak and shepherds pie. Very good, cool place, waitress and host were very nice. Quiet on a Sunday night."}
{"text":"James Joyce is the business class of Irish pubs.

Given the typical Irish pub that you find throughout the city, James Joyce takes a little bit of a different approach. With non-traditional food for a pub (higher class) and generally better service, this pub likes to treat you better. The wait staff provides a great level of service as well. My only problem with this pub is that the cost does not match the quality. I had a bowl of soup to start and then the steak salad. They were both quite good but not worth the steep price I later paid for them. Overall it's an alright place, but not worth the price in my opinion.

Overpriced food and service but it's still good."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Hyatt just down the street.  The person at the front desk recommended this place.  It is on a street closed down to traffic and has a beautiful exterior.

Meal: I went with the Guinness stew with puff pastry and the bread pudding.

Taste:  Just like a lot of Canadian places I have ate it, it lacked serious flavor.  Both were incredibly bland.  I guess salt has been outlawed in the land up north.  It wasn't that it tasted bad but it was like the cook was aiming to break even - he/she didn't want piss off anyone.  But sometimes, if you really want to wow your guests, you can't aim to please everyone.  7 out of 10.

Value:  The stew was pretty well priced - $11.  The beer and the dessert were on the price side.  If I had to do it again, I would just stick to the meal and a water.  3 out of 5.

Service/Cleanliness:  This is the hard part.  The waitress I had gave me some great recommendations for other places and was friendly.  However, she was not attentive by any means.  I was waiting for drinks and things of that sort.  7 out of 10.

Atmosphere:  I had a great atmosphere.  Most Irish pubs are contrived.  They just put up a bunch if Guinness posters and shit like that, then think \"hey, we got ourselves an authentic Irish bar.\"  This place was situated in a beautiful building, tin ceiling that did not appear to be new and the wood work looked original.  I didn't hear cliche Irish music, which is a nice change of pace. 4 out of 5.

Overall:  Ehh, there are plenty of better places around if you are willing to walk a block further down.  I probably won't go back to here again.  21 out of 30 points, 3 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Salmon kale salad = superlative.   Warm service.  Great decor.  Excellent beers.  Probably my best dining experience in Cal."}
{"text":"It's a decent Irish pub. 

I stopped in twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. First time I was walking by looking for a place to eat and walked out of the saj because of the lack of ventilation. I cannot stand smelling like food when I'm at business. Walked out and over here. I thought I would try the shepard's pie but was told the bangers and mash, another Irish food I hadn't tried before, was popular so I went with that. Bangers and mash must mean sausages and mashed potatoes covered in gravy and onions, because that's what it was. The meal was good, and the sausages were perfectly cooked, though it's not my style of comfort food. The next time I stopped in I came with a work colleague and ordered the Irish beer sampler ($11.50/4 samples) and the \"Traditional\" Irish stew that came with lamb. Honestly, it was one step above Dinty Moore Beef Stew. I couldn't believe it at first, but there it was. Not too bad, but I wouldn't get it again since it was so close to the cheap canned version. 

Decent service both times.

P.S. Maybe I'm being too harsh. Maybe Dinty had it right as a cheap version and I should laude this Irish pub for it's authenticity..."}
{"text":"Some people will be excited to try the food offered here. Shepard's pie, stew, ribs and etc. As always pub food is not my thing but I know my boyfriend and his family thought the food here was pretty decent.

Cannot comment too much on the food here as it was a special occasion organized by a conference.
Atmosphere is good without being fairly loud or rowdy."}

My salmon burger was delicious, the fish was not overcooked, and the yam fries were crisp and flavourful even without the tangy cream dipping sauce. Great place for a business lunch, but take note, the ambient noise level is lively."}
{"text":"It is surprising how much difference a few blocks can make. The Joyce (on 8th) has a distinctly different feel in both atmosphere and cliente than the Joyce on 4th. Yeah, they serve all the same food and have the same beers on tap. The furniture for both was largely taken from Ireland. And the servers keep to about the same level of service.

This Joyce feels a bit older and more staid - this is where my parents go for a pint. There are plenty of business people, usually skewing to the older side of things. It is friendly and chatty and rarely rowdy, which can be a bit different from the younger seeming Joyce on 4th.

The strawberries and brie is an excellent starter, and a bit of a treat. Sometimes I will meet friends here and we'll enjoy some apps, but the expense of both alcohol and food discourages that. On weeknights, this place seems more dinneresque than just people sitting around having a pint. It picks up a bit on weekends, but mostly it is one of the quietest (although very nice) Irish Pubs I have ever been in."}
{"text":"The James Joyce is one of those pubs that I could never really figure from just looking at the outside and heard mixed reviews of so never really went out of my way to check out the inside. And yet, on a rainy day last month, I found myself in want of some comfort food. And who does comfort food better than an Irish pub?

It's a bit fancier than what I'm used to in Irish pub land in Calgary. There was no seating of ourselves happening. Oh no, proper server, proper seating. And plenty of adornments on the walls. Most Guinness related. Go figure! 

In proper comfort food style, I ordered the Irish stew (where there is lamb on the menu, I will surely always order it). The best way to describe the rest of the menu? Hearty.

Anyway, mid-week, rainy, comfort food and some good company made for a much more pleasant eve out than what most cold days could offer me.

If you're there, make sure you take a trip to the washroom! The ladies' room is pretty fancy... and you've got to make it through a mini museum before you get there."}
{"text":"We checked yelp, and place only had three stars. So naturally I was hesitant to try it. However I am so glad we did. The food was fresh, delicious, and healthy!  Arsen, our waiter suggested we try the calamari on greens as an appetizer.  We loved it.  Although you can't go wrong with fried calamari , when you place it on greens the dressing and dip become very relevant and they turned out to be a perfect combination.  It was a true Irish pub, in the sense that the beer was a highlight-so we tried a sampler and we were not disappointed.  I had salmon on greens with strawberries and blackberries and my husband had chicken skewered satay on kale that he originally chose reluctantly.  In the end, he was very pleased. The ambience was great since we ate outside with the music playing. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Been here twice now.
Nice atmosphere and staff.
Tonight was busy so I sat outside

Had curry with fries and wine.   Both good!

The wine price are higher than elsewhere, but to be expected.

This is my highest review!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick bite and was pleased to see \"Scotch Egg\" on the summer menu. It was outstanding! The sausage coating was flavourful and not a bit fatty - just right. The centre was soft but not runny - perfect.  It was served on a bed of fresh arugula with a lovely, light dressing. I'd love to see this added to the regular menu!"}
{"text":"Very decent and reasonable Irish pub in my opinion.

Had lunch on the patio today with a bunch of colleagues. The food menu is typical Irish fare - boxtys, curry, stews, fish & chips, burgers, etc. They did have a lovely selection of salads though. I had the special of the day, which was a 6oz steak salad. Steak was awesome and cooked to my liking (medium rare) and served on the side rather than cut up overtop. Very tasty meal.

Prices seemed a bit steeper than usual for lunch ($15-$22 an entree) but who am I to judge. 

Service was reasonable and they have a nice patio. I didn't check out the interior besides a trip to the bathrooms, which were HUGE and very clean!"}
{"text":"Forgot my honey, brought the wrong tea bag, asked for cheese on my sandwich and it came dairy free.... Hmmmm, I am thinking that it might be better to just stick to Guinness when at James Joyce. 

The location is awesome, I love that they have a patio where you can watch all the shenanigans happening on the Ave. The servers were quite friendly and the food did come at a quick pace. I just wished that my waitress would have come back to ask if I needed anything or if it was okay. Instead she was on to the next table and did not return until it was time to get the bill. With some attention to detail I think this quaint pub could easily go from 2 to 4 stars, for me at least."}
{"text":"This was the first and probally the last time we will go here. We were meeting a group of friends, so while waitng we ordered the Lemon pepper calamari and the Vietnamese rolls. The calamari was HORRIBLE. as if the fried it  and took it out of the oil and put it on the plate and then set it in front of me.
The Vietnamese rolls were like the kind you buy in bulk at Costco. Overall the food was horible.
After our group arrived we started with the drinks. I drink diet and bacardi. Totally was watered down. the waitress was ok although it took forever to get the second, third, and   fourth round of drinks.  
The drinks were expensive, (remember they are watered down versions of the real  stuff:) so all in all I wont go back. and the Irish are not known for their cuisine......"}
{"text":"I have to agree with a previous reviewer: this is a business man's Irish pub. It's a great place to go after work (or with work colleagues) where you can get good beer and it's not too pretentious. 

As far as prices go, this place is kind of expensive for an Irish pub. However, for Stephen Ave I think the prices are reasonable if not on par with everything else around. That being said, I have judged a couple of places harshly because of their prices so I guess I mostly just mean that they are what you would expect (but there are some appetizers and things below $10). 

The beer selection is pretty good and they have your standard cocktails as well as some seasonal varieties. I had the warm port and a friend of mine had some tasty martini concoction. My husband didn't get a drink but got their shepherds pie with kale salad which was delicious. A couple of other people I was with just got wine and beer but everyone was happy with the selection. 

The decor is also much fancier than a typical Irish pub. However I still found the atmosphere to be fairly casual. There is plenty of seating either in booths or at tables and there is amble bar space. The service is pretty good and even on a busy night the waitress came around quite a bit to check on us. 

All-in-all, I really like this place for an after dinner and drink. If it wasn't in the core, I'd probably give it 3 stars for the price, but considering its location I am very happy with what you get for the money. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was in downtown Calgary for work and along with a coworker, was looking for a place to grab some dinner. We were walking about 6 blocks from our hotel when it suddenly began to downpour! The owner of the James Joyce pub was outside pulling in their patio tables and in her adorable Irish accent, invited us to come in out of the rain. We were really impressed with the pub when we got inside- dark and cozy, really comfortable, with enough knick knacks around that it really felt authentic! We decided to eat here. There was kind of a bustling bar area with high tables, but we preferred a low table, so we were seated in a back area with some high-back booths and regular table & chairs. I thought the girl seating us(who ended up being our server) was very pleasant and accomodating. 

It is worth noting that at that time, we were the only occupied table back there and in the hour and a half we were at our table, we never saw another patron. At 7:30 on a Saturday night!

Perusing the menu, I saw all the things you'd expect- shephard's pie, bangers and mash, fish and chips. But I saw no meatless options, so when our friendly server came by, I inquired about what a vegetarian might eat. She offered that they had a curry without meat or the Ploughman's lunch that could be ordered without the chicken and they'd add extra veggies. That sounded good, as I had seen in the description that there were lots of vegetables, so I was picturing a salad or something similar. My companion ordered their bangers and mash, on recommendation from the server.

When our food arrived(and it was pretty quick!), I was dismayed to see the plate set in front of me! 

This is literally what was on it:
- 3 slices of Roma tomato
- 3 slices of pickle
- 3 slices of cucumber
- 1 slice of red onion
- 2 slices of cheddar cheese, cut into 4 triangles
- 4 pieces of small butter leaf lettuce
- about 9 inches of white baguette bread that looked par-baked
- thimble-size ramekin of what looked like dijon mustard

I wish I had taken a picture, because it almost sounds like I am making this up, doesn't it? I guess I had not read the menu as carefully as I thought, because I was NOT expecting this plate of garnishes. I was actually kind of confused and didn't know what to do with all of this stuff at first until my coworker said, \"I guess you just make your own sandwich...?\"

Which I did. And it was fine. Fine, as in I should've just microwaved my Lean Cuisine at the hotel. You don't dine out at a restaurant for Fine. Coworker, on the other hand, loved his bangers and mash! It was a very generous portion of garlic mashed potatoes(that he said tasted homemade!) and 3 pretty good sized sausages, covered in a dark gravy. He said it was filling and very good.

Okay, so the bill comes out and his dinner(again, generous portion of homemade, warm food!) is $12. Mine(again, cold, very plain vegetarian sandwich that I assembled myself) was $13! We could not believe it! When our waitress came by, I mentioned that I thought that was a little steep. She said she'd talk to the owner about it and get back to me. 5 minutes later, she wordlessly dropped our bill on the table and walked away. Point taken. 

I will never dine here again and I don't think you should either. There are plenty of pub-type bars in this area. Patronize one that treats you with respect and values your business. 

Also, I do not think the menu they have online is the same one we were given in the restaurant. The one online looks more varied."}
{"text":"The appetizers were great!!.. We had the Brie cheese with strawberries and it was really good!!... The service was a little slow, even when the place was not full of people.. The main courses were Ok....I had the salmon salad, and it was a little spicy for my taste, but not too bad... I am not going to say this is a place you must go in calgary, but if you end up there for some reason, there are things to enjoy, like my appetizer..."}
{"text":"I don't normally like to give bad reviews, especially based on service. I've worked in retail for six years, blah blah blah everybody has bad days but for pretty much every waitress who waited on our table it seemed like it was a bad day. 

First, we order our beers and a round of waters. The alcoholic beverages came rather quickly so that was nice for me. But the waters, well never came. 

We waited a while our server passed us a few times and never stopped at our table, never brought us water or asked if we wanted food so we improvised and asked someone else. 

We order our food, I got the bacon wrapped hot dogs (I'm sure they had a nicer name but I don't remember). Yes oh yes they had me at bacon. Unfortunately one of the girls at our table ordered the special Dublin Dates (they sounded AMAZING) and they must have been cause they where sold out. So I guess that's something you should try if you go there. 

Our food finally arrived, it all looked so good. Except for the side order of rice and gravy the one guy at our table apparently order, no wonder we got strange looks when we order but the waitress must have miss heard him because he most definitely order FRIES and GRAVY. This was quite comical actually so no hard feelings. But on that note the food was kind of cold.

I was getting antsy and needed another beer so I decided to go to the bar as it was faster and more reliable to just get my drink myself. I was floored at the price of one Shocktop pint it was like $10. It was a good beer but not that good. 

On the plus side it was one of the nicer Irish Pubs I've been to. And they had plenty of bacon related items so, I will be back because I have friends who adore bacon as much as I do."}
{"text":"If you're a beer drinker this is the place for you!
Did I mention the beers are 800 dollars?
Okay maybe not that much, but you'll dish out about 9 bucks an import pint.  The food is dece, the service is just okay.  But otherwise good beer selection."}
{"text":"So, sadly, I have to agree with Neil on this place.  I haven't had the greatest experiences here either.

Everything seems extremely overpriced... including the water.  Okay, they don't actually charge for water, I was just trying to make a point.  I expect that when I go out I'm going to be spending a few bucks, but I was absolutely floored when our bill came.  $75 for a couple appetizers and 5 pints.  That doesn't seem right to me.  We paid our tab, but we weren't happy about it.

The service was fine enough, I suppose.  Our waitress didn't seem overly enthusiastic to be serving us, but she wasn't bitchy or rude or anything like that.  Our foods and drinks came in a reasonably timely manner, which was nice, and they were cleared pretty quickly after we finished.  The thing I didn't like is that they cleared glasses that still had beer in them.  I went to the bathroom and when I returned my beer, which had at least three gulps left, was gone and I was forced to purchase another.  Is that some sort of ploy?

Our beers were good and so was our food, but the prices were waaay to high for us.  We couldn't believe that 5 people had to pay almost $20 each for one drink and a couple bites of food.  No thank-you.  I'll save my money for somewhere a little cheaper."}
