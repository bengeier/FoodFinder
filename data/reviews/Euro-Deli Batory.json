{"text":"\"At no moment do I know what I'm talking about, nor of whom, nor of where, nor how, nor why..\"

a sentimental favorite,my mother, or mother that was and is no longer, used to make me perogies as a child. sometimes i have to restrain myself from saying 'thanks mom' when the polish lady says 'voila' and serves up a plate of mushroom/cabbage and potato/cheese filled goodness on a cold winter's day. i've tried the majority of the menu, but i always go back to the perogies, sometimes for myself, but most of the time for my mom

okay,none of this is true, my mom's alive and doesn't cook perogies, actually she's not that great of a cook.. which makes me appreciate this place and its homemade remedies even more.

highly recommended, anyone up for lunch? right , this isn't a dating website, carry on."}
{"text":"Lovely polish fare in this cozy small dining room

Very much enjoyed the polish platter (see photo).

Excellent value for stick-to-your-ribs food

recommended. 

They also have a few polish groceries and food to take home."}
{"text":"Un endroit incroyable pour se régaler de plat polonais traditionnels. Un petit restaurant avec épicerie sur place ou à emporter. Toujours un vrai régal et jamais déçu !"}
{"text":"Have the borscht.

The Hunter's Plate is great too but make sure you're planning a calorie burning activity afterwards, like stalking prey through the forest or going to the gym."}
{"text":"Tough & gruff Polish ladies, just how I like 'em especially when they're the ones making my fresh boiled mixed plate of pierogies. Can't get em like this back home in Brooklyn so I indulge and also get the Borscht soup too."}
{"text":"Amazing cheap polish place. The perogies are to die for!

Also, this place has polish desserts, groceries, movies and magazines...Basically if you're at all interested in Polish culture, check this little gem out!"}
{"text":"The moment you walk into this cozy little neighbourhood joint, the heady smell of delicious, savoury home-cooked food hits you. It's the kind of place that's easy to miss, so I'm glad my coworker introduced me to it.

The menu is a nice selection of Polish comfort foods including several soups (Québec favourites French onion and pea soup alongside the more Polish beetroot and veggie soups), sausage, stuffed cabbage, and of course pierogies! The onion, mushroom, cheese and potato pierogies are a sure bet, and a plate of them comes with a little coleslaw, sour cream, and salad. Eat them in the cozy little dining area or take them to go. 

They also have various Polish products including some grocery items, DVDs, and other suchlike imported treats. Personally I like to grab one of the inexpensive Polish chocolate bars (75¢ - $1, just past the fancy expensive chocolate bars) to top off my comfort meal!"}
{"text":"Pyszne! Delicious!

We had perogies and sausage and boiled cabbage. I passed gas for 36 straight hours afterwards. The borscht was delightful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend was first introduced to Euro-Deli Batory by his good friend, who incidentally had lived in Poland for many years. We've since moved just down the street from this little secret of a place (not necessarily a factor in our decision), unassumingly nestled between the wood-smoke bagel shops of central Mile-End. 

The menu is pretty straightforward, tacked up on a long strip above the deli counters of fresh meats and cheeses. They serve classic Polish homestyle fare, including pierogies, stuffed cabbage rolls, Polish sausage, hunter's stew, borscht, and potato pancakes. They even serve fresh (and bottled to take home, if you want) tripe soup, as well as what I term \"the man plate\" - the \"Polski Talarz\", which is made up of a huge medley of everything. 

Inside, wooden walls give the impression of a small, warm cabin in the winter, ideal for the lengthy Montreal winters. A few tables are tucked to one side, and sitting beside them, a tiny grocery section filled with sweet treats. 

Service is friendly and quick. Prices are very reasonable and the food is always cooked hot and fresh. Really, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"This lil' deli is housed in a mini Polish emporium that sells groceries, movies, and magazines from the Motherland. The cornerstore vibe offers up quick and friendly service, and delicious, quality, authentic Polish food. 

Go for the potato-cheese perogies, Ukranian borscht, and side of sauerkraut and sausage. Nothing fancy here: just simple, classic Polish fare.  Once you've discovered this place, I guarantee you'll be planning your next lunch there! Did I mention that it's cheap too?! 
 
Easily my favorite diner in Mile End."}
{"text":"We went here on a hot summer day and started with a bowl of cold borscht. It was pink and had a dill flavor. It was excellent. The mixed pirogi plate was kind of a mixed bag- the sausage ones were ok. The mushroom ones were better and the cheese ones were the best. We shared some polish sausages and they were really good as well. The food is very well priced and there are about six tables in the market so grab a space if you can!"}
{"text":"Amazing heaping plates of crazy delicious perogies are to be had here, along with some of the best borscht (hot or cold) I've tasted. The spot is tiny, part specialty Polish grocer part restaurant (maybe 4 small tables total) all hot Polish lovin. The windows steam up in the winter and you can sit in companionable coziness eating your mounds of winterizing goodness, watching the cute families and couples mozey along St Viateur. Batory is located right next to the gorgeous church on St Viateur that hosts great craft fairs in the basement, making for an excellent one two punch of yum and yay."}
{"text":"I'm half Polish and that place was just like eating in a Polish home! Generous portions, delicious and authentic taste, friendly yet reserved server. We were wowed. I had the bigosz will all the fixings. Not a fancy place, but cozy and excellent quality for the price."}
{"text":"I have been going to this pierogi joint for years. Get a mixed pierogi plate with extra mushroom sauce and a side of sausage....The apple-cherry juice is dee-licious. Everything here is delicious! The soups, sandwiches, all of it. They sell their in house pierogis frozen as well, for snappy snacks at home."}
{"text":"I LOVE IT. After passing this place many times, I finally visited this place about a month ago and have been back four times already. This is my favourite place to get some (non-poutine) comfort food. The Borcht, perogie plate (you can get a mix or vegetarian only) and mushroom/cabbage croquette plates are what dreams are made of. Somehow even the coleslaw and shredded lettuce with dresssing are amazing accompaniments. Eating here makes me feel I'm eating a meal made by my family and the women who handle the counter are wonderful - not overbearing but sweet. Good prices. During the week is it a lunch spot (closed Mondays, though) but on Thursday and Friday they stay open until nine which is my favourite time to go as it's quiet. Has polish grocery items, some bread, desserts and frozen items like their perogies as well."}
{"text":"If I'm totally honest, and calculate this according to the following formula NUMBER OF VISITS x AMOUNT OF PLEASURE PER VISIT, Euro-Deli Batory is my favorite restaurant in the entire city. No other restaurant even comes close. I told someone behind the counter this one time and he blushed and ran back into the kitchen. Recommended: potato-cheese perogies, kielbasa, bigos, Ukrainian borscht, spring borscht (in the spring and summer)."}
{"text":"It's exactly as described - home-style Polish deli food. It brings back some ancient memories of mine from going to the houses of friends of my mom when I was a little kid in Edmonton. But the thing is... I don't think it's that great. Everything is a little too boiled and a little too bland and .. that's accurate, but I don't want to actually eat it. Sorry."}
