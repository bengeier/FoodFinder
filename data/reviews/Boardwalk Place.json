{"text":"Great location, plenty of tables. The prices are very high for very mediocre food and the servers are all business. It is the closest location for a meal and cold pint after volleyball, but a short walk up the street to Queen St is Murphy's Law, which is more reasonable and welcoming."}
{"text":"How can this place only have 3 stars!?

I always come here for their salmon and steak entrees. When it's not jammed pack with beach people in the summer, the food always come fresh and the portion size is GREAT. It's a place to get real, delicious food, not that pretentious fine-dining stuff.

One time I went there in the late fall, when we asked for the dessert menu, the friendly waiter brought us all the real desserts on a tray for us to see.

Needless to say, this is one of my fav places for casual dates.

*update, thanks to the waiter who ran out on a cold day just to give my gf's iphone back.

Quality - 9/10
Portion size - 9/10
Service - 9/10
Overall - can't ask for more, so 10/10!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place!! Started with a strawberry daiquiri and I must say it is the best one I have ever had. They have a huge patio that overlooks the beach which is perfect for a nice sunny day. The food was also delicious and the waitstaff was hilarious and efficient.  I would go everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Beach bar beach bar oh yeah beach bar! OR IS IT????

The inside resembles an Irish pub type affair with plenty of wood and the walls adjourned with sports related memorabilia. 
The wash rooms in this place need improving, the ones at the bathing station on the beach are much better.

Around the back is a very large patio area, although do not expect much of a view as the foliage and trees block out the one reason for having a beach front bar, which is having an actual view of the beach and water.

Sapora on draught will always get a place one star in my reviews although it was $24 for one pitcher. Being the only pub here then I suppose they can get away with charging that little bit extra.

The food - had a mix of sweet potatoe fries, onion rings and normal fries for starters with some bruschetta.
All were fine except for the onion rings which were over fried.

As a main order the voodoo pizza for two. Although the portion itself was okay enough for two people the pizza itself was not. The base was hard and the pizza itself was a bit too spicy, even for a Pizza that sells itself as being spicy.

I get a feeling of this place being outdated and needing some reinvention, I for one would prefer to see more of a beach vibe. 
Stick some surfboards on the wall or something (although nobody surfs on the lake)!

Also it would be great if from somewhere in the pub or patio there was a view of the beach and water. 

The staff  here were good, not superb but not bad either, and OUCH I got bit for the first time this summer by a mossie, non bueno!"}
{"text":"3 stars.

Great location. Played volleyball followed by drinks at the pub. I would say the service is good (not great) but this place gets busy. They have some good stuff on tap. For Apps, tried the nachos, calamari and bruscheta. I would rate them all average. Tried the club and the burger - average yet again. The dessert is fantastic - great homemade chocolate cake. 

I would rate 4 stars if your going for drinks but 3 stars if you eat there."}
{"text":"Short Review: The service was average but it took them way too much time to notice us, serve drinks and such. We have to wave them over to get their attention and it took us several tries to finally have a server come to us. Since there was a damn frat party outside, we have to wait for hours to finally get food that were warm although she did give us a discount which isn't worth it or would not make any difference because drinks werent free to refill and everything total to about 90 or so dollars. I would recommend you rather go to the strip of restaurants in Queen Street than even going here."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting too much when i walked into the Boardwalk Pub last week. I'd been there before, but that was years ago and i hadn't been that impressed. 
When we sat down i had one thing on my mind \"NACHOS PLEASE!!\" Shock and disappointment overcame me when i could not find nachos on the menu! Is this a PUB? Pffftt... fine then. I'll take the tortilla chips and cheesy salsa stuff. It wasn't really what i was craving. But it was okay. 
What really made my night was the STUPENDOUS Caesar salad. \"Oh come on Cheri\" you say \"It's just a salad\". No no, kind yelpers. It was more. The dressing was so good! The croutons, yummmy! And the bacon, OH the bacon! It was not fake, it was not bits. It was good bite sized pieces of deliciousness. So when you got a good forkful of salad, you could appreciate the bacon-y goodness with every bite. 
I wouldn't give this place a 4 star just for a salad though. But my bf ordered the rib and wing combo with sweet potato fries. I tried some ribs and they were really good. Flavourful with fall-off-the-bone tenderness. Also, the sweet potato fries were fried up perfectly. Nice and crispy. And the sauce that came with them was good too. 
The atmosphere here is a bit blah. I'm sure it's much better in the summer, and the patio looks awesome. Very big, with a great location next to the beach. 
The food will definitely bring be back here again to try some more."}
{"text":"it's a regular pub with a regular pub food.

it's located conveniently close to the beach boardwalk so if it starts to rain or gets colder you can always run into her. 

the restaurant is spacious and the staff is friendly.

I'm guessing they would have a patio in the summer but not sure."}
{"text":"The Boardwalk Pub gets an extra star just for the location.  It's surrounded by parkland and has a big patio within eyeshot of the beach volleyball courts and the lake.  It's a great place to go for a casual celebration.

The food is standard pub fare with some pastas and pizzas.  The ribs are weirdly unpredictable - they were delicious the first time we went, and my husband obsessed over them for weeks.  When we returned, they were good, but entirely different.  A third visit brought ribs that were very nice, but not as good as before.  The rest of the menu has been fine, but the club was made with deli sliced chicken, not cooked on site.  

The beer selection is very good, and I've had excellent recommendations from the waitstaff - I had my first Tankhouse Ale from Mill Street Brewery there; the waiter even brought me a little glass of it so I could taste it before ordering a pint!

Parking can be difficult on beautiful summer days; be warned!"}
{"text":"This place still sucks so bad with the service. Waited over an hour for nachos. Nobody knows what they are doing here.  Terrible management and terrible service. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"I've popped into this place a handful of times over the years just because it is the closest place to the beach if you want to walk along the boardwalk then stop in somewhere for a quick bite. Most recently I went down to there yesterday for lunch - parking was free! Apparently the Woodbine Beach parking lot is completely free after Labour Day. We had the fried calamari appetizer ($9) 3 dips with pita bread and a Santa Fe salad. The calamari was a overdone but the serving was pretty generous, the pita bread was soft and the 3 dips were OK but two of them were so similar we couldn't tell them apart and the Santa Fe salad was pretty good. The service was pretty slow, which can be nice if you're not in a hurry (it always depends what mood you are in) but they have a nice patio and the atmosphere is very casual. The menu is mostly pizza, pasta and burgers. Beware the shrimp cocktail ($9) only has 3 shrimp! I would go back mainly because it is on the beach."}
{"text":"Located on the boardwalk (who knew) down at Ashbridges Bay, this pub is convenient for the beach going crowd (although it is too busy for me to enjoy on a saturday or sunday afternoon in the summer). 

The menu is a fairly avergage pub menu that is prepared well. Its the dessert menu that impressed me. Our waitress informed us on our last visit that all desserts are homemade daily and there is a wide selection for all palate's!"}
{"text":"Rude customer service is all I have to say! We can't even walk our dog in when the door is right there to the patio. Then to have another waitress say \"seriously no dogs here\" with attitude! Furthermore, I asked for my cup of water 5 times and when she FINALLY brought it still no sorry? When the bill came they didn't even care! We could of just walked out and not pay! Bitches! 

As far as the food goes it was pretty good. Not a big selection but your typical pub grub."}
