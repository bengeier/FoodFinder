{"text":"3.99 for pasta and $1 for veggie medallion. Excellent! Saturday afternoon and there was plenty of parking! Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Pretty good foods with decent prices provided by Ikea for customers. Coffee here is good. Cheap breakfast if you come early. Anyway, you won't be disappointed to stop by for shopping break."}
{"text":"This has to be the best bar-goon in the city!  Its not fancy, but if you need to fill the hole, it is entirely realistic to get lunch for under $5.00, or to eat like a king/queen for under $10.00.

I don't have a pricelist in front of me, but some of the highlights, from my shakey memory include:
- hot dogs - 75 cents
- two hot dogs and a drink. - two bucks
- frozen yogurt - $1

The prices get fuzzy, but other items under $5 are:
- salad with dried blueberries and feta
- organic pasta and tomato sauce
- veggie wrap

Under $10.00 is pretty much everything else:
- 15 meatballs with mashed potatoes, gravy, cranberry sauce - i think that is sitting around $5.99
- chicken dinner
- rib dinner
- some type of salmon dinner

This restaurant will not be features in Gold Medal Plates Calgary 2013, but if you are hungry a day before payday, belly on down!"}
{"text":"I honestly love everything about ikea. So much. My favourite part will always be the cafeteria, though. I often get the Swedish sandwich (it's only $2!) and Nordic water. 
I love sitting in the cafeteria area to study as it's well lit and a nice laid back atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Staff at the cafeteria told me that a certain item did not contain dairy so I ordered it for my son, who has a dairy allergy.  He loved it so I went downstairs to grab and frozen package of the same food and it turned out it had dairy!  Not cool.  Little buddy had a rough night.  Won't be back to the cafeteria."}
{"text":"2017. 11. 25. We stopped by the Ikea food court for lunch on early Saturday morning. We each had our own dishes and share. I had Chicken Ball Combo, which included couple chicken balls, some vegetable, mash potato, a glass of pop, and a slice of cake. Besides that, I also got a piece of Garlic bread. My boyfriend got fish and chips, salad, Garlic bread, and a doughnut. The whole meal cost us around $20. The food was not fresh, most of them were old. The Garlic slices of bread were cold and hard to eat. The doughnut was the same.  The Chicken Balls were not real meatballs. We had a horrible experience at IKEA"}
{"text":"Review: dinner.

Ooh Ikea. The wonders it has brought to students and the alike all around the world. Smart thing they did to open a cafeteria that's extremely friendly to families and shoppers.

Bottomline: decent place to grab a bite if you are shopping in IKEA. Super family friendly.

Atmosphere: decorated with all their furniture and furnishings (it'd be silly of them not to), everything is modern and minimalistic. They have probably the best family friendly surroundings in all of restaurants and cafes in the world. Play area, dispensable bibs, high chairs, size 3 diapers, the list is endless. The only unfortunate thing about the cafe is the fact that it's not very clean. Makes sense though considering how many families come eat here.

Food: we ordered the Swedish meatballs with fries, the chicken Swedish meatballs with mashed potatoes, and the fish and chips. Everything was average tasting and a bit overcooked. Really can't expect much considering IKEA specializes in furnishings and not food. It's like going to the mall and expecting a cultural tour.

Value: good and cheap considering the amount of food. Just don't expect a mind blowing meal."}
