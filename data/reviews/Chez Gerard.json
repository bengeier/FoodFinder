{"text":"Good honest food made by a good hard working crew. Cute 50's style diner. Food cooked in full view by the line style cooks on nice clean equipment! Clean place and good prices. Poutine , burgers, Montreal smoked meat Sandwiches, onion rings and fries, never go to a fast food chain again! Just good simple diner food."}
{"text":"Visiting my family in Laval, we have ordered take out from Chez Gerard on many occasions. It's their favourite spot to get a Smoked Meat Sandwich and Fries. Our trip is not complete unless we get our SMS fix! The only reason for a lack of the fifth star is that I've never experienced the actual restaurant and I wish there was a way to keep the fries crispy for the short trip a couple blocks away. Delicious none the less but I challenge Chez Gerard to solve this dilemma or I guess we'll have to eat in next time. Good value and would recommend! Looking forward to \"la prochaine\"."}
{"text":"Been to my fair share of fast food diner places and all my experiences at Chez Gerard's have been a poor man's Belle Province.  Got the hamburger and poutine and both left to be desired. Thin lifeless pattie squashed on the grill and tasted of disappointment. Poutine was mediocre with not enough sauce to cover it and the cheese curds still very cold. Fries tasted a bit like old oil needing a change.  I have mild expectations from fast food joints and Chez Gerard didn't meet them.  Pretty diner though. Clean. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Un diner coloré à l'extérieur comme en dedans. La raison pour le 2 étoiles ?  Les pour:  très bons sous marins et frites fraîches.   Les contres :  le service bête au comptoir Le fait qu'il est impossible de payer avec interac et lorsque je la tends c'est comme si je tendais une souris morte. Le dégoût dans la face de l'employé.  Il pointe alors un guichet de voleur a l'intérieur.  Pas le choix si je veux manger Les toilettes étaient très sales et n'avais pas était nettoyées depuis plusieurs jours."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many years and they still have great value, the other Chez Gs sucks and this is the only good one. Take the triple DDD or hot dogs, they are bigger than other fast food places and they cost the same or less. Great value, good fast food and a very clean restaurant."}
