{"text":"I've now been to Shakey's twice.  The first time it was out of desperation as it was Christmas Eve and my out of town family and I were trying to escape the madness of the holidays at my dad's house.  I wasn't totally impressed then, though it was a few years ago.  However, after reading the new reviews here I decided to give it a try again.  The food is much better than you would ever expect food at a bar to be.  It was delicious and fresh but unpretentious."}
{"text":"This is the place to come if you want to watch the Leafs lose in a sympathetic atmosphere, while drinking Molson's or Labatt's by the pitcher.  Not to be confused with the similarly-named, but very differently-themed Skarkey's down the street.  There's plenty of sports memorabilia on the walls, but you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else that had bathroom door handles made from old hockey skates (without the blades, thankfully)."}
{"text":"First visit, won't go back. Barely any cheese on the nachos and they charged $1.50 for sour cream but didn't inform me until the bill came. The quality of food and service was not worth the money."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best! Maybe it's the vintage hockey para on the walls, the rotation of craft beer from local breweries or the fantastic menu of pub favourites and a daily sandwich special, but shakey's has won my heart. Black bean soup is so flavourful but the fish and chips are by far my favourite (Fridays only). Shakey's is by far the best stop for the leafs game!"}
{"text":"We really love the food here and there are always good beers on tap.  The ingredients  all sourced from local shops like Rowe Farms and everything is always perfectly cooked.  The specials, fritters and burgers are amazing.  The wings are perfectly done and the salads are fresh and tasty.  It is definitely one of our go to lunch places, a gastro pub disguised as a sports bar.  The ownership and servers are fantastic and they really support the community in a variety of ways. They've even held fundraisers for local charities that raise proceeds for Sick Kids Hospital.  We love Shakeys and return again and again."}
{"text":"I was enticed to check Shakey's out by the ad series running up the Runnymede Station escalator showing one by one where each ingredient of their burger came from in the neighbourhood. So my wife and I sought them out and were initially surprised by the pub-like atmosphere -- I was expecting more of a diner or eatery vibe but being surrounded by people for whom this was clearly their local quickly grew on us.   We sat at the bar and the bartender was super friendly and keen. We ordered a couple of local craft pints and I got the burger while my wife the grilled cheese from the kids menu. \"How rare would you like your burger?\" That's not a question you get asked very often so I leapt on the opportunity. \"As rare as you legally feel safe serving it.\"  I got a burger that was a dark caramel beautiful brown on the outside and deep red throughout the inside. Hell yes. And the fries were golden, crispy, and just the right amount of salted. I usually douse my fries in vinegar but these were too good to not have as they were. Apart from the occasional dip in their house made mayo that rearranged the neurones in the pleasure centre of my brain.   I'm not often in Shakey's neck of the woods. But I guarantee you the next time I am I'll be back for a bite of that beautiful burger of theirs."}
{"text":"Awesome place with great atmosphere.   - Crowd leans a little older for the most part with 30-40's  - Food is solid; burgers and mussels are solid.   - good beer selection"}
{"text":"Not the same Shakey's.!Mike S. is right! The new chef is awsome! I think his name is Chris.  Hands down the best burger in the city! Rowe Farms!! Nice to see that  all the food is bought in Bloor West, unlike Myplace which is local in name only. Wish they would change the inside to match the new food. Chef introduced himself to us and mentioned that he would have different specials depending on what he gets in the morning. I've eaten here more in the past month than in 5 years"}
{"text":"Went there last night for dinner.. its like an upscale pub. It has been updated since the last time I went a few years back; and this is a definite improvement. The menu is simple and the food is great - again, upscale pub food. Yum. The nachos were great; and the burgers were excellent. Surprise sauteed onions underneath the burger. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Shakey's what an appropriate name. The only thing that was worse than the service at this place, was the food. What a crappy joint this is. If you like eating frozen deep fried garbage with people over 75 then you will love this place. So sad that Kennedy is the only legit pub in the area. We had wings- which were watery, from being frozen and sauce was ketchup. and a chicken sandwich - dry and boring...  oh, and the really craptastic kids pasta, which is noodles with plain tomato sauce.. for $7..    Never again!"}
{"text":"Well previous reviewers have propped up this place to be good but I don't think it's all that it's made out to be.  First of all, there is no website so that's already a no no for the business.  Walking in the establishment, the place isn't too bad looking.  A few of the locals are in there.  My second pet peeve was the waitress who was working had no idea there was a Champions League football match going on.  She left the music on while we were trying to watch the game.  If it's supposed to be a sports bar, turn the damn music off.    Getting to the food, I was totally disappointed. The menu was very limited itself.   $12 for a grilled chicken sandwich?  I'm sure the chicken was fine but it was put in between a cheap ass hamburger bun.  The fries were tasty but that's about it.  Now I know why it was an omen for us the night before not to try the place out.  I wouldn't recommend the place at all."}
{"text":"Solid neighborhood bar with a great wing special.  Never too crowded, beers are cold, service fantastic, and it's also two blocks from my house.  One of my go to spots!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pub food!  The calamari and the burgers are great."}
{"text":"I've been to Shakey's twice and really enjoyed it both times. I had the calamari and it was cooked well and the sauce was really tasty. We also ordered the nachos and they were pretty good. My partner had the special of the day, pork schnitzel with a side ceasar salad and really liked it. The pork was tender and flavourful."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, and friendly regulars -- there's much to like about Shakey's."}
{"text":"Shakey's was the prototypical divey-sportsbar until a late 2010 make-over.  Now its weird in a cool kind of way... the same divey regulars sitting in fancy digs drinking trendy craft beers.  The menu got an overhaul too.  The regulars, with their stained Leaf caps can now order wood planked salmon, or other trendier fare.  And the food is good.  Try the curry fries.  A very fun place to watch the big hockey game, and close to public transit."}
{"text":"Know this about me, I love a good sports bar.  The more independently owned the better, so that you don't need to deal with the vanilla-flavoured experience that a chain restaurant provides.  The sad part is that being in Toronto, and me being a Senators fan, you can pretty much guarantee that every independent sports bar in Toronto is going to be Leafs crazy.  So be it.  Shakey's is a quintessential sports bar for Toronto.  As you'd expect, Leafs shirts and other memorabilia line the walls of this Bloor Street West pub.  This is the type of place that you'd expect regulars that play on baseball, hockey, and soccer teams to come in after their respective games.  And they do.  In droves.  Because of the intense sporting atmosphere, this is one of the places where you would want to watch one of the big games whichever it may be.  The beers on tap are numerous, and the menu is as typical and as good as you would expect in a sports bar of this stature.  The wings come off especially good in this place with a suicide sauce that is hot and tasty and not hot-for-hot's-sake.  Sad to say that I like this place even as a Sens fan.  The days that I go, I just don't wear a Sens jersey."}
{"text":"If the Leaf's made the Stanley Cup finals, and it was game 7, I'd go early to Shakey's to watch the game for two reasons: 1) It is a mecca for Leaf's fans. 2) It is so close to my house that I can easily stumble home (whether they win or lose).  I counted six large flat screen TVs when I was there having lunch the other day. SIX. So there's no seat in the whole place where you couldn't check out the action.  As for a restaurant....it's not. It's a pub. But I think Shakey's isn't trying to be anything but. Beer and boys in blue, that's all they're trying to do. (Hey! That rhymes! Shakey's owners, if you want to use that, let's talk.)"}
{"text":"Gord and I had lunch today at Shakey's.  We sat inside and it was nice and cool.  If you are a hockey fan, you would like it because there is tons of hockey memorabilia on the walls (the restaurant was originally owned by former Toronto Maple Leaf Mike \"Shakey\" Walton).  Gord started with mushroom soup, the soup of the day.  He was it was delicious (he ate it all) and he'd get it again.  He also had Crab Croquettes.  He said it was really good and he'd get it again.  I ordered Dave's Burger without lettuce or onions.  It was a really good burger.  I ordered the patty \"medium\" ... it was juicy, flavourful and tender.  I'm not a big fan of French fries but these were really tasty  I'd get this again.  Emma was friendly and took good care of us.  I'd stop in again the next time I'm in that 'hood."}
{"text":"Best Black n Tan in Toronto ? Come to Shakeys! Becka pours them best!  Come for the pints, stay for the food. Amazing daily specials , amazing wings! Think local, think Shakeys !!"}
{"text":"Shakey's was such a nice surprise! The new interior was crisp and clean (a little too clean and bright for a pub, I like just a bit of grunge!) and the menu was concise with a good variety of options. The burger was just the way I like it - organic meat, on the rare side of medium-rare, with a fantastic bun and cheese. It was cooked perfectly and good value at $12. The fries were fresh cut and equally tasty. If you want a burger in bloor west village - this is the place."}
{"text":"Pouring Rain and sharing my small pink umbrella with my Yelp Drinking Buddy making anywhere that has a drink and shelter desirable, and we just walked inside Shakey's.  If you are a sport fan or you going out with some one really boring, Shakey's for sure is the place to be!! No matter where you sit, you have a clear view of a TV or 2 with whatever games they are showing. So basically you can just ignore your date/friend pretending you watching TV and he/she would have do the same to you!   Waitress was really friendly and check on us all the time. A good selection of draft $5.75 a pint which is quite reasonable. The food they offer is of a higher end pub fares sourcing from the other stores in the neighbourhood includes Rowefarm, Cob Bread, Snapper Fish Market. Organic and local with a price that reflects that! The last thing I expect is to have a Organic Burger in a Sport Pub?!  Shakey's friendly staff and laid back vibe makes it a decent place to hang if you are in the neighbourhood! They also have a smallish patio from at the front!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go to in the neighbourhood, atmosphere are older men watching sports, not the best for a younger crowd but not terrible. Food is getting a LOT better. BURGERS made with local ingredients."}
{"text":"This place revamped their menu a few years ago and the food is actually quite good. Their Caesar salad, burger, soups and daily sandwich are all stand out choices. The staff are friendly and very attentive.  They're beer selection is not bad, but they always have a rotating draft beer selection which I like to sample. Lots of TVs to watch Leafs game or whatever."}
{"text":"I thought I would try it.  It's the only pub in the area that I hadn't sampled. While the beer was good and hoppy, it was overpriced.  The chicken wrap was...meh...so-so.  The waitress was friendly and pleasant, however she was a bit pushy.  Would I like the machine she asked while I was still working on my second beer.        Forgive me, Brydens, it was a one time thing, honest."}
