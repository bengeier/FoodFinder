{"text":"Cute and colourful restaurant! Perfect for when you want a healthy and fresh meal on the go...not to mention very reasonably priced!! The salads are light and tasty, the soups change everyday and the banh-mì are made on a deliciously light and crunchy bread!! A must try!! (Grab a cookie on the way out !!)"}
{"text":"This place delivers on what it advertises - good food at a good price. I got the house salad + satay chicken and a bbq chicken sandwich all for $15 (including tax). I'm not a Bahn Mi expert, but both were extremely tasty. It's kind of crazy that just a few stores down, Vertu is selling salads at more than twice the price! The counter top bar is a really cute and hipster way to wait for your meal as they prep it for you :) 

Looking forward to coming here more often on my way back from the YMCA."}
{"text":"Delicious bahn mi the size of my face for $7!  Retro, diner-style counter seating decor!  Friendly local owner and employees!  Scrumptious peanut-butter and jelly cookie!  What more could I want for lunch?  As a neighborhood local, I just wish they were open for dinner / late night snacks too!"}
{"text":"Poulet satay banh mi and soba/japchae with tofu skins. 

Great chewy bread with a little bit of crunch. Usually, banh mi bread is terrifying - I'm not a fan of the banh mi bread that rakes off a layer of the inside of my mouth. This bread was delicious and very inviting. The flavors were all there for the meat and veggies. 

The surprise was the soba/japchae - it was packed with so much flavor, nice kick of spice and they made me want another bowl immediately. Soy beans, cucumber slices, carrots, etc, the tofu skin.... all the spices and the noodlessssss. Coming back after sound check tonight."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, particularly the bread, which is key to any Banh Mi. Met the owner, he is of Moroccan background which he represents well in his menu."}
{"text":"Super bon sandwich, à un prix très abordable! (7$ taxes incluses!!)
Il y a le choix entre poulet satay, poulet ''autre'', porc braisé, avocat, etc...
Je dirais juste que le sandwich pourrait être un tout petit peu plus copieux, car à la fin je n'étais pas tout à fait ''remplie''
A essayer tout de même!!"}
{"text":"So far we tried the chicken satay and the tofu sandwiches. Both very tasty. Bread is very fresh too. Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches and daily soups. I love coming here for a quick bite. The avocado banh mi and sweet potato coconut ginger soup are my favourites. The food is always fresh and delicious. Bread is always freshly made from the morning. The resto decor is so true to the area! If your visiting or a local, you need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Les meilleurs sandwichs et biscuits au beurre de pinotte. Et toujours de la bonne musique en prime!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The atmosphere is so chill and the food sososo delicious. First time I came in I got a lemonade and it was life changing. Minty and lemony goodness. 

Second time around I went with my boyfriend to try the Banh mi and they were fantastic. 
Fresh ingredients and yummy flavour combinations. I got the avocado and my boyfriend got the chicken satay extra spicy. He did say it wasn't spicy enough so if you love spicy make sure to ask and get it extra extra spicy. 

I loved my avocado sandwich, it did have a little bit too much bread but that's just the style so can't really complain about that. The avocado was fresh and the seasoning was perfect. 

The staff is really friendly, they made me feel right at home. They also have a killer selection of imported snacks, I went crazy and bought almost everything.

I'm so happy they're close to my house because now I can go all the timeeeeeeeeee.
Seriously, check this place out."}
{"text":"Not your typical banh mi but I really enjoyed mine! We ordered the chicken char siu and braised pork banh mi's. For $6, you get a generous and filling sandwich. Good meat to veggie ratio and the bread soaked up all the sauces, making it nice and soft. They also had a nice variety of Asian candies, cookies, chips and drinks in store. Friendly, laid back service. My only criticism would be with regards to the ca phe (Vietnamese iced coffee). I found it was FAR from what a ca phe is - not strong enough, thick enough and sweet enough. It was a little on the filtered and diluted side for me."}
{"text":"$6-8 for a bahn-mi (I went for vegetarian tofu & avocado combo) super filling so can't complain! Would go back. Enjoying the independent, local aspect of this place. Gonna dock a star for the bread I'm not sure it was 100% fresh but it was the end of the day so I'd give it another shot."}
{"text":"The avocado bahn mi is genuinely one of the finest sandwiches I've ever eaten. My wife and I can't stop thinking about it. We will definitely be back again and again and again!"}
{"text":"New restaurant in the area. 
Great spot for banh mi. Great service and quality. We were greatly received with a smile and some cake. The bread is amazing and the soup was delicious. A must if you're in the Mile End."}
{"text":"Really love this place. The store is adorable. Staff is so friendly and helpful and the atmosphere is definitely chill. The Bahn Mi is very good, bursting of flavor. Love that we found this gem in town"}
{"text":"One of the best Banh Mi I've ever had.

And I've had a few.

The bread is ridiculously fresh and chewy. Perfect consistency.

Tried both the pork and chicken, and both were equally delish.

Prices are fan-friendly: Seven bucks for a fatty banh mi.

Unless you are dying for a bagel, skip it, and go next door for a tasty banh mi and you'll forget all the fuss about those sesame bagels!

Yum! I'm ready for another..."}
{"text":"Great setting and refreshing fresh food. Perfect music and friendly staff who are actually interested in what they're doing. The small menu is just right. The only drawback is sandwiches aren't toasted, but that's a minor complaint when everything else is so great."}
{"text":"Meilleurs Banh Mi sur le plateau. 2 choix de poulet, 1 porc, 1 végé. Pas de l'authentique viet; plutôt fusion mais très original, généreux et délicieux. Les salades de nouilles froides sont aussi excellentes. 
Bonus: Vraiment pas cher!"}
{"text":"Come to this place for a remixed banh mi! They don't take the traditional route to preparing the classic sandwich but they do a hell of an amazing job in creating something delicious. The restaurant has a relaxed atmosphere and the little chat we had with the owner while we ate made the place seem all the more charming."}
{"text":"how to say this, first time i had a non asian person making me the most delicious soba noodle ever, the toppings are soooo delicious, i will be back to try the bah mi!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING bang for your buck. SIX dollars for a huge homemade sub. Yes.

Few sandwich choices, and some noodle options. I can only speak to the sandwiches (banh mi).

The line gets a bit long at lunch, but the team is efficient and you'll be in and out within 10 mins.

You can eat in on their bar, or take to go. They'll wrap up your sandwich up in some deli paper and a fun color rubber band.

The bread is FRESH as. 

I always always get the avocado sandwich, but my friends love the satay! You could even ask them to add avocado to your satay if you're feeling fancy. 

You can pick your level of spice. I personally put none, and still find the sandwich to be well seasoned. They will load up a lot of coriander on your sandwich (literally, they just pop a few sprigs on in there...), so if you're not feeling coriander, then I'd get them to leave it out."}
