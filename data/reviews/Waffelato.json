{"text":"Came in for a pressed waffle cone. You know, what they're known for. They were out of batter and the employee said she was cleaning up so she wasn't going to make more. For reference, it was before 8pm and the park was busy. We left to go somewhere that could accommodate their customers."}
{"text":"Located in Downtown Las Vegas Container Park of the first level. One of the best bubble wrap ice cream I had in a good while. It was made fresh to order and in a efficient manner. Definitely worth the stop!  

I had one of their top selling cones which is the Pacific Sea Salt and it was so good especially with the hot weather and all. Filled with Nutella, fresh strawberries and cream. YUM!"}
{"text":"I found this place by them following me on my Instagram. I finally found the time to go downtown to check them out. They are located in Container Park. I went in and the place is small but a lot of the shops in Container Park are. I ordered the Pacific Sea Salt. Every thing that is a Specialty with the waffle is made to order. It truly is made with love. The gelato with the Bubble Waffle was AMAZING! The warm waffle with the cold gelato was just right and an amazing combination. I hope they get real popular and open other locations within Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Homemade plump waffle used to make an amazing Colosseum Waffle! Nutella & fresh banana lined the waffle to receive a large scope of strawberry cheesecake gelato. It was absolutely amazing! My husband and I shared one because I didn't think I could finish it. I probably could have finished my own & will definitely order my own next time. Love this place! I forgot to get a picture of it and only remember after it was all gone. It was THAT good!"}
{"text":"I can't even believe the service I received here. 

It started out poorly when the woman (named Fatima) behind the counter snapped at my friend to close the door. There was no sign asking that the door be kept closed, and we would have been very understanding had she asked kindly. Instead she chose to be overtly rude. 

I tried the gelato, and it was by far one of the worst things I've ever had. I considered asking for an exchange for something else, but they were sold out of every flavor they had on their menu. After the poor service and the horrible gelato, I asked for a refund. Fatima was again rude, and called her manager to ask how to complete the refund. She started out the call with \"some lady who didn't like the ice cream wants a refund,\" again with a rude tone. 

I would absolutely not go here again. I'd like to give Fatima the benefit of the doubt. I know people have bad days and take their negativity out on others. But, even with a different worker or better service, the product was still terrible."}
{"text":"I'd love to rate them on their product but they lock the doors well before the posted closing time."}
{"text":"Nothing like a hot, fresh waffle filled with the creamiest gelato!!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delcious. I always thought gelato would only be tasty by itself, but the toppings mixed in were mouth watering.  The crispiness of the waffle and the soft interior was the perfect complement to the gelato. The woman working there was absolutely amazing and very patient with me trying the different flavors.  The place isn't that large, and it does get a little busy sometimes, but it is definitely worth a trip to for anyone. My new favorite dessert in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"A summer day at the Downtown Container Park isn't complete without a frozen treat, and Waffelato fills a vacancy left following chillspot's relocation to Tivoli Village. The menu of bubble waffles and shakes suggests signature combinations or one may customize their own. The bubble waffles are griddled fresh and served hot, creating a nice contrast to the gelato. A plastic gelato spoon was a suitable utensil for separating pieces of the waffle to eat with bites of gelato and toppings. Gelato is brought in from California in eight flavors: bubblegum, mango, passion fruit, vanilla, chocolate, salted caramel, cookies and cream, and strawberry cheesecake. Waffles are made from original or chocolate flavored batter. I was very satisfied with my original waffle, cookies and cream gelato, topped with more Oreos and chocolate syrup. Service was welcoming and friendly. With individual desserts running around $8 and shakes just under $6, the bill adds up quickly for a family."}
{"text":"Employees were grumpy. They were looking at their phones when we came in and almost looked at us like they didn't like us. I was uncomfortable just being in there. Don't know how you have unhappy, rude people selling ice cream. Good luck when you have people like this running your business."}
{"text":"They were really busy and out of just about everything so it took them a looooong time to help me even though I was the only person in line. But once they did they were friendly if harried. The Pacifica was delicica. :) Wouldn't make a special trip, but if I had a craving for gelatin the area would go here!"}
{"text":"Pacific Sea Salt. Go get it. Frozen strawberries, sea salt ice cream, caramel drizzle, and whipped cream.  Legit waffle cone."}
{"text":"Love this place! 

The waffles are yummy but it's truly the sorbet & ice cream that makes this place stand out!

To beat the Las Vegas heat, your going to want something to cool you down!

From gelato to sorbet, waffle cone or bubble cone, you'll definitely cool down the Las Vegas hotness with something kewl like this place.

Grab a cone and enjoy walking around the heat!

I recommend the pineapple sorbet or the mango.

So refreshing!!

Maybe getting a milk shake might keep you kool!

Who cares! It's frosty and delicious & you kids will want it!

Enjoy

:)"}
{"text":"Holy crap.

If based strictly on flavor, this would be six stars despite the Yelp-permitted five. The pineapple sorbet was absolutely ridiculous. My taste buds have never experienced anything so perfect in their 37 years of existence. Light and sweet, this sorbet is clearly made with actual fruit and its juice, as there is is the perfect amount of pulp mixed in throughout the entire cone. 

How do I think we offer can be improved? I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to my frozen treats, so a waffle really isn't my thing. If I can get this in a huge cup, I would pay a pretty penny for it. I would love to see this option added to the menu.

So why the four stars instead of five? Customer service. The girl who waited on us seemed definitely bothered by our very existence inside of the establishment. While she was barely serving us she was busy texting on her phone (black cat phone case) and never even made eye contact with us. There wasn't a single smile during our entire exchange and we felt shafted by the digital check out system had us automatically 15%. She definitely did not deserve a tip.

Despite the bad service I will absolutely be back so that I can fill my mouth with amazing pineapple sorbet and also a lemon for the road."}
{"text":"Got the seasalt something or other... *fire emoticon*

Waffle cooked to where there's enough crisp, add in a scoop of seasalt ice cream *airhorn emoticon* 

Would definitely come back or recommend. Go here if you're craving desserts, you won't be disappointed. *thumbs up*"}
{"text":"Favorite dessert down town. Have always come in afternoon on weekdays so I can't speak for the rush. Employees do seem disinterested, but that doesn't take away from bubble waffle from being amazing. Warm, crispy, and sweet, it melts gelato quickly and makes a mess... But is so worth it."}
{"text":"The waffle and gelato tasted alright nothing really special about it, flavors were limited, and the employee seemed bothered working there because she was just on her phone and looked annoyed when we walked in."}
{"text":"The waffle was bomb and gelato with whip cream was really good. My thing is the gelato looked fake. It seemed its not made with real fruit. The colors were too bright regardless I will come back to eat it. The cone is huge so I would share it with someone."}
{"text":"What's better than an cold treat on a hot day? A waffle cone from Waffelato. Waffelato is a nice stop on a hot day to quench your sweet tooth. The gelato is some of the best that I've had in the area. The waffle cone was made as we waited which was a great touch. None of that, already made instead fresh as you order, which is the way to go.  The service was excellent and friendly and the price was good as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I each got a waffle cone and two different flavors.  The waffle cone was nice, the gelato was nothing special but tasted good.  Price was what I expected given the artsy location in the container park.  If a regular ice cream place would have been closer I would have gone to it as the selection of flavors was less than stellar."}
{"text":"Employee is not very friendly and has difficulties explaining difference between fresh and frozen fruit."}
{"text":"The waffle texture is soft and not crispy outside which doesn't mean it's bad if you like it that way. I'd expected a lil crispy from it. The ice cream part is good, the kind I like where it's not too sweet. 

I got annoyed at how slow the service is here because it's just one person doing everything and he didn't look like he's a pro at it but I felt bad and gave me discount."}
