{"text":"This place is \"THE BEST\" pizza in town.  The owner may be a little short with the customer but hey if you've worked in that area for 30 years you would be too.  Finally a pizza that doesn't taste like cardboard. Sauce=10/10. Crust=10/10. Oh and gotta try the steak hoagies!!  Best in town.   All others need to take notes from \"AMO\"."}
{"text":"It was Friday during Lent.  So that meant a cheese pizza.  I hadn't furnished my kitchen yet and I was hungry.  I decided to try a local spot close-by.  What a mistake.  The cook looked like Hyacinth's brother in Keeping up Appearances - complete with the sweat-stained A-shirt clinging to his immense rolls of fat.  But, hey, maybe the food is good?  I got my pizza.  I ate a few slices.  I never experienced anything like it before - sort of like a cracker topped with pizza sauce and cheese.  Me no like."}
{"text":"I drive by this place often, and decided to try. I believe that a place ought to be able to stand by its plain cheese pizza. Amo's didnt impress, and the service backs up my low review.

 I called in to order, \"do you sell by the slice?\" yes, so I order 4 pieces. guy is gruff and says 6 dollars. so I head that way. They are a cash only business which is primitive. At last I I pay and grab the box, I ask to use the restroom. they don't have one, I ask if there is just a sink to wash my hands in. they don't have a sink. I ask for a napkin or paper towels and they haven't even got those.

Despite this failure of resources, maybe my pizza will rock. No! rather than 4, I had 8 tiny squares (3x3 inches). bland crust, bland sauce, bland cheese. there is no reason to patronize this place for pizza. and based on other aspects of my fair-go-at-it, I'm not worried about trying the other food"}
