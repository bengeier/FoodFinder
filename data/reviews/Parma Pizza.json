{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! I've been coming here for about a year and it's the best in Toronto! They have a walk in special of $7.99 for a large pepperoni pizza, which is awesome. I also recommend their Mediterranean pizza!!!"}
{"text":"One of our first  missions was to find a local pizza joint that rivalled our usual Amico's pizza in out old neighbourhood This is our guilty pleasure:  Parma Pizza. It is a somewhat hidden gem on Scarlett south of Lawrence; a plaza on the west side. The sauce and toppings are always fresh, never sitting, and pesto and dough is freshly  prepared. If you love high quality pizza with a fast delivery and great service-this is it! Try it for yourself and you too will become loyal veterans."}
{"text":"Great pizza. I usually like to mix up my pizza stores, but lately I've just been coming here.  It doesn't look like a place where u would get great pizza, but u really do get great pizza. And the owners or workers there are very friendly. Two thumbs up. 

Update: 
This place keeps making better pizza! 
The owners or workers, not sure, are fantastic people. Always happy and positive. Now I have my family hooked on this place. Every time we want pizza, which is about every week or two, they all say lets get Parma!!"}
{"text":"4 stars for three pizza. 5 stars for customer service. One of our pizza orders was wrong. I called....they apologized and siad they would send out another pizza asap. It arrived lightning fast. Would order again."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after work. Luckily it was still open, because it looked like he was ready to close. I was looking to get a slice, but he had none left. Luckily I was able to order a walk in special small pizza with 3 toppings, a drink and extra dipping sauce for $10.50. It was definitely worth it!perfect crispness on the crust, generous amount of toppings, and had the perfect flavour I like in a pizza. The owner Tony was very friendly and generous. Will definitely be going back whenever I'm in the area"}
{"text":"Brought the family in to try the pizza. It was a mixed bag.

The crust is quite good. Thin and crispy. I'd say this is the highlight.

The sausage and cheese pizza is not that great. I wouldn't get it again. The sausage has a strange flavor to it. The sauce is uninspired.

The other pizza we tried, as my son requested, was the bacon and mushroom pizza. This was a much better pizza, as it didn't have the strange tasting sausage on it. But, the sauce was still lacking in flavor in my opinion.

Some other Yelpers wrote about other menu options outside the pizza realm. I can't speak to those as I didn't try anything else. And, in the end, it's a pizza joint. It should be their forte. 

If you're in the neighborhood, it's worth a try. But pizza is a highly competitive business and I wouldn't drive for kilometers to eat here. There are better options elsewhere."}
{"text":"I was looking to get a pizza for delivery.  I thought this local spot might just do the trick.  The experience was not yummy in the thy tummy.  But the service was great!  The phone convo was friendly.  The delivery was super fast too!   I got a small veggie pizza and garlic bread.  The pizza looked underdone and lacked in flavour.  However, all the toppings were fresh: tomatos, peppers and mushrooms.  The garlic bread was boring.  Food was fresh but lacked tasteful goodness."}
{"text":"Place has awesome pizza hands down. Ordered up The Special #2 2 med pizzas 3 toppings. Pizza came as ordered within 30 min and were both delicious!!! Definitely my new go to spot for local pizza. Just one complaint...bring your patience if you are ordering delivery."}
{"text":"We always order large takeout pizza, usually ready in 15 minutes and fills up two men. We really love this chewy and affordable pizza and drive past other pizza places to get it. Friendly service from the staff who remembered us the second time we came in! Also regularly order potato wedges which are pretty standard and done right. Once ordered the rice balls which were surprisingly yummy! Looking forward to trying other items on their eclectic menu."}
{"text":"A nice and cozy little restaurant in the heart of Etobicoke. The place is pretty modern as they're are murals on the inside of the shop and cool little fishes in a fish tank inside of the store. There is enough seating for only about 10 people. The first thing I ordered was a large mushroom pizza and some potato wedges. The pizza was very fresh and it tasted amazing! However, the potato wedges were a little on the salty side but they were still yummy! This place deserves it's 5 star rating mostly due to the fact that the service here is incredible! They're some of the nicest shopkeepers I've ever met! Definitely a great place I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good. Service horrible. Ordered by phone  guy said come in 20 mins. Got there and they said they forgot about the order.  Asked do you still want the pizza and laughed."}
{"text":"We just had a great pizza from Parma Pizza. The ordering service was efficient and fast. Our pizza was deliver in less time than they said too.
The pizza had a nice crispy bite and was soft when you finished it. Crust was nicely baked. The toppings on the Canadian pizza were excellent and plentiful.  Sauce was great. We really enjoyed the pizza."}
{"text":"I personally think I'm a connoisseur of pizza and Tony makes the perfect pizza - if you are a bacon lover, like me he uses the freshest best ingredients and the bacon is cooked crispy perfect-not soft-not burnt-DELISH! NOT to mention the freshest of salads - garden - Greek my fav with delish feta and kalamata olives to die for-huge portions and his home made again FRESH balsamic dressing is the best! I almost forgot to mention his panzorotti/calzone-I prefer baked are also huge with a delish side cold red sauce-probably his pizza sauce-again just delish!"}
{"text":"Tony the owner is great. Hot and honey wings were awesome. Pizza has a light thin crust - pleasantly surprised!"}
