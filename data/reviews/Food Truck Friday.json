{"text":"Went to FTF last night and we will be going back.  Live music and great variety.  We could not even try them all.    JJ's - had the #1 and Charheel.  Both of their staples.   The #1 had some spice to it with the chili relish and crisp pickle gave it a nice crunch.  The Charheel was delicious as well with chili, slaw, mustard and onions!  Vitos - had the individual cheese pie.  Good NY stlye pizza.  Robust tomato sauce and the right amount of cheese.   The crust was also crispy and had good flavor.  Rock the Mac - got the traditional mac and cheese.  It was very cheesy.  Next time i will branch out and add some stuff to it.  Italian ice from the Philly trailer was also good.  I got the lemon.  It was cool and the perfect ending to a great variety meal.    Overall was very pleased with the event.  Cant wait to go back and try the others!"}
{"text":"My Favorite of the FTF locations  #1 - This is the most family oriented of the events and locations  #2 - They have a park and sandbox for the kids  #3 - They have a band each week to jam out to while indulging in goodies  #4 - There is a indoor building to use the restroom that is well kept  #5 - Parking is plentiful in different business lots without the worries of being towed  Let's now even mention all he good food and trucks that vary weekly but we always find a hit each time and some of our ALL TIME favorites show up like  A Bao Time Sugar Street Spice Maryland Crab  Just to name a few, this is always a GOODTIME with my family and friends that meet us there to lay out on the blankets with the children and eat.  I failed to mention that they have a great police presence on the street to help with crossing back and forth from parking lots across the way to the park which is a huge help when trying to cross South Trade during rush hour as the food truck event starts at 5pm - 9pm.  It's a must do especially if you have children they can meet some new friends."}
{"text":"So glad this weekly event has come to Matthews. Lots of food trucks, the lineup is posted on Facebook ahead of time, and some of the better known ones like Oowee BBQ and Hot Box come here. There is a huge green space to sit and eat and there is always live music.   On the downside: The music is not always great, my personal fave food trucks seem to go to South End's FTF and unlike that one, no BYO alcohol is allowed in Matthews. The crowd in Matthews is mostly young families and kids, South End is less family-oriented."}
{"text":"I love food truck Friday! It's such a fun thing to do with family! There is usually if not always great live music and the food trucks are not always the same. My family and I are glad to see if come back!"}
{"text":"The environment here is great with music and entertainment for the kids; however, the food truck aspect was a complete mess. The wait at each truck was huge and an hour into the event some trucks ran out of some menu items. I waited 30 minutes for my food after ordering and my chicken sandwich was bread with a scoop of chicken skin. We would come again, but only if we brought our own food."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to Food Truck Friday in Matthews, and I have to say it is pretty impressive! There is a great variety of types of food, probably about a dozen different trucks. There is also live music in the park. Great event to bring the kids to!"}
{"text":"Carolina Commercial Kitchen you did it RIGHT, the food, the music and it's DOG friendly. We got there at 5:30 and didn't leave till 9:30. We ate Hot Box Next Level all the items on the menu 3 times, we had one of every Southern Cake Queen desserts, Cheese Cake on a stick x 4, a few Imperial Sandwiches, OOOOh Weee BBQ Sundaes , I've had it different ways but never with Mac & Cheese in it too. The music was great , the weather smiled on it and at 52 & 58 respectively my husband and I hadn't laid under the stars on the grass since 1995 when we were dating and that was the icing on my Southern Cake Queen Cake. I know it was postponed a few weeks but please Matthews never ever take my food trucks away"}
{"text":"It's a pretty cool atmosphere. Not really a lot of places to sit and eat. So if you are like me and really want to enjoy your food by means of a table there are a few but not many. Had a band which was so so, but really I think folks come to socialize and try different food. Of course it's outside so wear what you would to a back yard cookout. My food was good but I would say it depends on what truck you get it from. Be prepared to stand in line a while to order then wait more to receive your food."}
