{"text":"Excellent ribs.  Ordered take-out twice from Mojos. The ribs are Carolinas style, which means more mustard vs. tomato sauce.  Very tamgy with a bit of a kick. The ginger lemonade is excellent, especially when you add a shot on rum when you get home."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Got the pulled pork sandwich and it came with so much meat that it was falling out the sides.  Great service, quiet atmosphere.  Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Great spot! Easy to miss based on the location but this is a great spot for meat lovers. Must try the tacos!"}
{"text":"Checked out mo.jo after seeing their feature on York Region Eats. I'm thrilled to report that it was awesome. 

I've been to smokehouses all over North America and visited all the GTA's \"top smokehouses\" (see Chris Nuttall-Smith's Toronto Life top 5 list here: http://www.torontolife.com/daily-dish/features-dish/2011/06/09/the-south-rises/) and it is obvious after my first bite that mo.jo Smokehouse needs to be at the top of that list. Unbelievably delicious and authentic ribs, pulled pork, and imaginative sides that bring \"Southern-Style\" saucy smoked BBQ to a new level. I'm willing to put them ahead of my favourites in the Carolinas (and can't believe it). 

Do yourself a favour: go hungry and ready to rave."}
{"text":"They've got the mojo.  This little place behind Al Casale on Leslie Street reminds me of Memphis BBQ in Milton.  I started off with a Ginger and Lime drink that they brew in-house--it's pure nectar!  Soon they plan to offer it with vodka--look out!

My 6 rib meal included fries, and I ordered the collard greens with white beans as a side.  These ribs are different from all the other BBQ's in Newmarket.  They use Carolina sauce which is more savoury and has more vinegar than the typical sweet BBQ sauce.  The rub was also a unique and wonderful flavour.  I am still a fan of the sweeter sauces, so I hope they will add the option in the future.

When I visit a rib joint I could have anything on the menu, but I always start with ribs as a reference point.  My incisors did not touch the ribs!  I was able to peel the meat clean off the bone with my fingers--that is what \"fall of the bone\" is supposed to be like! My hands were a mess but my face was clean, which is the opposite of how it usually goes.

The bottom line is that Mojo's ribs are much more tender than Big Bone BBQ.  The sides are also more interesting.  The fries--well I don't waste my stomach space on fries.  And the ginger lime drink was the perfect accompaniment.

The service was amazing, the ambiance was what you could call \"an upscale rib joint\".  Prices are competitive.  5 hours later I could still smell smoke on my hands even though I washed twice since lunch.  Ahhh the memories."}
