{"text":"The servers are so friendly and attentive here!! The prices are reasonable too. I went with my gf and ordered the grilled octopus, caprese salad and funghi pizza. + Bottle of red. The food was fresh and the octopus wasn't chewy but grilled perfectly. The lighting is good at ur table- that's how you know they dont wanna hide the food. I'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"All food is Amazing with fresh ingredients. And the waiter is so nice. Enjoyed every moment."}
{"text":"WoW !!!    This place is amazing. My family was there on Saturday night (Nov 5th) and the place was packed."}
{"text":"I'm finally glad there's a good Italian Restaurant! This spot used to be Mexican Amigos at the Plaza near York Mills and Don Mills.

I visited this new restaurant because they had a Grand Opening special of free Salumi Board and sample of wine.

Our server, Deborah, was very friendly and attentive. She makes sure you're taken care of.

We ordered the following dishes (#1 and #2 are from the Daily Specials that are not on the normal menu):
1. DAILY FEATURE PIZZA $16 -GORGONZOLA, ROASTED wALNUTs, PEAR, PROSCUITTO, ARUGULA

This was so goood!! However, this reminded me of the Ct'Mang pizza from Terroni! Not sure if this pizza is a common italian flavour or they sort of chopied it, but I don't care. It was really delicious and I loved it.


2. POTATO GNOCCHI, BEEF SHORT RIBS, PORCINI JUS, RAPINI, GRAPE TOMATO - $19

I was very impressed with this. I was initially hesitant to order this because gnocchi maybe too heavy and I prefer noodle type pasta. But I'm glad we ordered this. The gnocchi was perfectly cooked and didn't feel heavy at all. The short rib was melt in your mouth tender and they gave a huge portion.


3. Salumi - $14 - Artisan Cured Meats, Marinated olives, Parmigiano Reggiano

The mussels and clams were delicious, but the clams still had some sand in them.


4. Cannoli - $6 - Ricotta cheese filled

These were very good. Hard to find good cannolis in Toronto. I really loved the filling. The pastry was still not as good as Bar Buca's. It's a little pricey as well. 


OVERALL
Overall, I really liked this place. I hope they will survive the spot since that spot seems to be cursed. When we went on a normal Sunday lunchtime, it was pretty empty. Hopefully, things will pick up for them."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night with my family and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food; it definitely exceeded my expectations.  I shared an order of fried calamari, as an appetizer, with my brother and it ranked in the top 5 we've ever had (and we generally order calamari at every restaurant we go to that serves it).  The batter was really light and full of flavour.  For my main course I had the spaghettini with jumbo shrimp.  At first glance, I thought the portion wasn't going to sufficiently satisfy my appetite, but it was the perfect amount of food.  Everyone else had positive experiences with their meals and I'm sure we'll be back soon.

We had an excellent server who knew the menu and specials by heart.  He was very kind, witty and helped make our night out as a family more enjoyable. 

As mentioned in a previous review, there is a pianist that performs (on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, I believe).  It would be nice to go back on one of those evenings and see how that enhances the atmosphere.  

The only thing I didn't like was the decor.  It was pretty tacky with faux Corinthian columns and kitschy, Romanesque features.  I'm not a fan of artificial historicism and prefer modern venues to embrace contemporary design.  That was the least of my worries, however.  The food -- as I mentioned -- was great, and that's what matters the most.  I hope this restaurant will be successful and will have a long life in the Don Mills area.  We need more high quality, independent dining options in this part of Toronto.  There's an over saturation of banal, chains that are bland and tiresome."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely Mother's Day dinner with my family there.  Good food and friendly, attentive service.  My mother in-law's short ribs was the best dishes of the night.  I enjoyed the lamb dish as well."}
{"text":"Went to this place for lunch with colleagues, the menu selection is ok, the cold soup I ordered as part of lunch special was less than perfect, salmon was well made, so was the veal from what I heard. The place was empty on Friday at noon, which is a popular time for lunching out, service was nothing to write home about. Overall an ok experience, won't likely go back here again."}
{"text":"Our party of twelve showed up at the door and saw this sign on the door. We didn't even get a call or email to let us know they are closed! I'm so disappointed in management. Luckily another restaurant in the Plaza was able to accommodate our party within a reasonable time. Otherwise our dinner arrangements would have been disastrous. My friend received an email the day after asking us how our visit was. We'll be sure to give them feedback."}
{"text":"I'm very happy to see a good Italian restaurant opened in my neighborhood. 

My family and I were planning to get some Popayes takeout last Friday night. But we all changed our mind when we saw there is new restaurant open after Panera Bread and Mexican restaurant Amigo closed within very short time I see maybe two years. After we entered it, we found there is a lady playing the piano lively. Wow kind of surprised but it turns out to be annoying later since it's toooooooo loud.....

The daily soup is mushroom soup which comes with very strong and pleasant  mushroom aroma. And it tastes awsome, also goes well with the bread.

We chose Pollo pizza, Spaghettini  and daily special Sirloin.
I like the mozzarella cheese and feta on top of the pizza as well as the thin crust with crunchy rim. A little bit oily due to the olive oil but ok. The spaghettini is so good with mussels and shrimp. Their spaghetti is made on premise. Quite different from others 

Last but not the least,the dessert TIRAMISU amazing presentation!!!the bowl holding the tiramisu is made of chocolate also made on premise.   Very thin layer of the lady finger but strong and pleasant flavour. I'm so into it.

Cusina is also an espresso bar. sports fan can also watch games and have a drink here.

Maybe go there again for their spaghetti"}
{"text":"The place had a great atmosphere but the food I was not a fan off - the pizza was a big miss and I'm not too picky!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation online on January 8 for January 10.  On January 9, received a form email from OpenTable saying the restaurant cannot honor the reservation but gave no reasons, so we had to make alternate arrangements.  Drove by the restaurant on the 10th (happened to be in the area) and saw the windows papered over, the Cucina 865 sign was already removed, and temporary signs announcing \"Paisano Pizza\" grand opening on the 17th.  Clearly the place had been closed for awhile.

The website should have been taken down and the restaurant removed from the OpenTable system long before the date I was able to go in and book."}
{"text":"This is an opening of a new restaurant and I would rate it 10/10! There was a live piano player playing and it added the ambience of the restaurant. A Mexican restaurant used to be in Cucina 865's place and the owners decided to undergo a new Italian venture under the executive chef Chris Kanka.

We ordered grilled calamari to share as an appetizer and I ordered the spaghettini. The grilled calamari was a cute little octopus grilled upside down with its tentacles sticking upwards. It sat on a bed of greens above a balsamic reduction. This appetizer is a fork and knife appetizer as the calamari needs to be sliced and enjoyed with a bite of greens. Although I'm not a huge fan of aglio e olio pasta, the spaghettini was perfect! The scallops and mussels were cooked to perfection - the pasta was al dente. The portion sizes are not too big, but enough for a romantic dinner date.

The servers are attentive and very enthusiastic - they are excited about the opening of a new restaurant and the new crowds they'll bring :)"}
{"text":"Great service and great food! We've eaten here three times now and the quality of everything is consistent. Tonight was a Saturday night and there was live entertainment. Every time we've been here the staff has been super attentive and friendly. There were seven of us including two toddlers who had a great time dancing to the music! Definitely fun and lively. My favourite is their angel hair pasta special, but everything is tasty. As for the scandalous David that greets you at the door, his privates have been covered, so he cannot offend anyone anymore. Better not take your children to Florence until they're adults. Anyway, I highly recommend this restaurant as it's always a good time!"}
{"text":"There's a live pianist. \"What!?\" He later became a live guitarist. When we asked, they weren't sure if they're going to keep bringing back beautiful music every night (they absolutely should!). Service was excellent. Despite the dining room only opening a few days before we visited, the friendly server was knowledgeable about the items on the menu and was able to provide recommendations. He also appeared several times to top off water and bring more bread. The food took quite a bit of time to come though, but I was satisfied because it was worth the wait.

The grilled calamari was great. At many places, overcooked calamari will taste tough and rubbery. Here, there was no such thing and it tasted great aside from some flaky burnt bits.

The lamb shank was also good. Very tender, fall-off-the-bone. I think just one or two cuts with the knife was all that was needed to separate the entirety of the meat from the bone. The veggies tasted salty, but I think it's because I let them get mixed into the barbeque-y sauce on the bottom. The mashed potatoes were quite creamy.

The wifi password is 12345678 and the network name is MexicanAmigos (the name of which will apparently change soon!)."}
{"text":"Cucina 865 is A-OK! Came here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was not too busy. 

Our waiter was really nice but seemed a little confused. Maybe he was the only waitstaff in the dining area and was a little overwhelmed. He talked to himself a lot but still quite friendly. 

I was a little confused, too. We ordered the Prix Menu ($39.95) which is really good value. The steak was cooked really well and loved the side vegetables! But the Kale Caesar (Baby kale, romaine hearts, crisp herb croutons & pancetta with light anchovy creamy dressing) has no kale at all?? 

I was more confused. We ordered Seafood Linguini ($25) which the only thing my dinner mate would eat. But Seafood Linguini was in a pesto sauce instead of the white wine tomato broth as described in the menu. He was a little disappointed as he does not like creamy sauce. I was happy to packed the leftover to go!

Worth coming by to check out their prix menu for dinner and lunch. Lunch Special pasta/pizza from $7.99 sounds A-OK!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, very polite and attentive. 

We got fresh bread which was nice and warm when it came and delicious to hold us until our food came. 
We started with their Cesar and it was okay, personally not enough dressing for me so I cannot comment on their dressing. 
I got Penne al a vodka and it was okay, I have had better but it was not terrible. But for the prices I excepted something a little more. 
My mother got their fish of the day and she enjoyed it came with sufficient amount of potatoes and veggies on the side. Fish was cooked well."}
