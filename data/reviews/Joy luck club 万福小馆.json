{"text":"Great food, their duck and bbq pork dish (number 1) is so good.  There is a lot of food which is not labelled but you can get someone to explain what each thing is."}
{"text":"Ate here for first time tonight - 2 thumbs down!! General Tso chicken was grizzle. Kung Po Chicken was greasy and very little chicken - what was there dark meat. Chicken Lo Mein oily and smoky not much chicken there either. No fried rice available  Another review said great food like NY??? No way - lived in NY for 49 years. This stuff was awful and not on the same planet as food from NY. I do not suggest eating here - I know my family and I will never go back"}
{"text":"Combo Fried Rice or Lo-Mein made to order!  This is as fresh and as good as it gets.  They are very generous with the added beef, chicken, pork, and especially shrimp.  Cooked perfectly!   I've so far only tried these and a soup, but they appear to have a very full menu.  I'll update as i try more."}
{"text":"I had to think about this.  I don't like to leave low scores. But it deserves low.  I will eat anything! This place gave me pause.  We are not in China, but this is very China like...sanitation included. The low score is for 1. Hair in my food. 2. The center of my egg roll was cold...obviously from frozen  3.  Hard to understand the staff.  4. Plastic folks...and $11 for dinner.  I will not return. The food was....who knows I was so wigged out by everything else!!"}
{"text":"This eatery is inside the Asian market.  We ordered General Tso's, sesame chicken and spring rolls. The food was tasty. We were pleasantly surprised.  She even remade the spring rolls for us because she said the first batch turned out too dark. This is a huge market. In addition to the restaurant and grocery store, they also have desserts and other items for sale.  We even picked up a bottle of sake at the market. It is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"So I have shopped here a few times and bought a rice cooker which is definitely getting its money's worth alone.   The Cashew chicken dish (pictured in the photo reel) was delicious. Really nice flavour, excellent cut of white meat chicken, and the vegetables still retained a nice crisp to it.   The egg roll was fresh and excellent, the rice was pretty good, and the pork steam bun was amazing.   I highly recommend this place to anyone craving GOOD asian cuisine, the clientele was primarily of asian descent, I was one of the few \"howlies\" eating there (borrowing a term from a Hawai'ian friend of mine) and you could tell it is a popular choice for dinner.   Not an aesthetically pleasing looking place, but the food was excellent, the staff was friendly, and the prices are excellent for the portions. Xie Zhin! (See you soon)Also the deserts at the bakery range from cream dishes, g√¢teau, pastries, and bean paste items.   Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I work in the film biz and in LA often and I eat in Chinatown for the best House Special Fried Rice. Until I   discovered the Joy Luck , I have been disappointed in the Charlotte area. Now it is like my favorite Chinese restaurant and the chef here is as good as any in LA. 5 Stars for sure. It is the best.  Jim S"}
{"text":"Ordered house fried rice without shrimp.  It was loaded with meat but it was all chewy and gray, bleh.  The rice had good flavor, but the meat was probably a little too tripe-ish for my preference."}
{"text":"Inside the Grand Asia Market, this Chinese express food is really awesome and convenient. You can choose three courses of cuisines plus free soup at only 7.42 bucks!! And food here is way more diverse and authentic than Panda Express. Except for the set meal, you can also order noodles which will be cooked immediately. Steamed buns, milk tea and breads are also serverd. I'll eat here everyday if I live near it!"}
{"text":"This review is for the reataurant inside the Grand Asia Grocery Store called thr Joy Luck Club. There's a mix of authentic and Americanized chinese dishes served here.   I typically get the combo where you pick 3 differebt meats/veggies and rice, for about $7. Pretty good deal. They also have chinese roast duck, chicken, pork hanging. You can buy it by the lb or as a combo. They also offer a bunch of traditional chinese noodle soup dishes as well.   If you purchase seafood from the grocery store, you can have the reataurant cook it for you for a small fee. Food is pretty good. If a certain dish looks like it's been sitting at the steam table for too long, I wouldn't order it. For the price, it's a great value and delicious meal"}
