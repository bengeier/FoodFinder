{"text":"Went for lunch with my family today. We all had donairs and were thoroughly impressed. Everything was fresh and tasty. Best donair I've ever had. Homemade donair and hot sauce were excellent. We also tried the garlic fingers. Couldn't stop eating them. The owner Neil was very friendly. Will make this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"I use to love Donairs growing up. Street meat heaven! When I noticed a place on the Danforth had recently opened and was receiving amazing reviews I had to check it out.

Neil the owner looks like he listened to a lot of Van Halen growing up and was extremely nice. You can tell he is a big fan of kids (offering up free treats from the cookie jar).

The Donairs were amazing, just what you'd want after a few beers. 

Thanks for opening up Neil! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Only autenthic place where to get real donair in Toronto! And for amazing price! Food is always fresh and it is great in every weather!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot! You walk in and it just feels good to be there. The service is friendly, the food is delicious and the music is excellent. 

I'm a fan of the donairs and garlic sticks (oh yum) but recently tried the chill too. I was told it had been \"made with love\" and, from the first mouthful, I couldn't disagree. It tasted just like my Dad's except better because it was smothered with cheese and comes with sour cream.

The only reason these fine folks don't get five stars from me is that the dish ware is all disposable. My chill would have been so spectacular in a real bowl with a real spoon instead of styrofoam. Maybe I'll bring my own next time because I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. From the authentic Nova Scotia donairs to the Nova Scotia radio station playing in the background, this place is on point. Great Donair inspired menu and reasonable prices. Go and check it out. You'll be supporting small business and a fellow Nova Scotian working hard in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch the first time! Very delicious and quick. The chef/ owner I'm assuming was very nice and welcoming! Will come back:)"}
{"text":"Tough to find a good donair place in Toronto, until you try this one. Meat and sauce are made in house and are dead on. Will definitely be back anytime I'm on the East side. 

Totally recommend to any fellow East Coasters looking for a taste of home or anyone else looking for solid Canadian food."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentically made donairs. The sweetness of the donair sauce combined with the homemade hot sauce and slightly crispy beef is flavor heaven. Garlic fingers are tasty with an amazing and perfectly crispy crust. Owner is friendly and genuinely cares if you've enjoyed your meal. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"What a great spot to have lunch! Grab the classic donair and you won't look back. Owner makes everything from home made and rules!"}
{"text":"I moved to Ontario from the East Coast in 2012... And to the Danforth over the weekend! This is the first Donair I've had outside of PEI or Nova Scotia. It's legit. I will never try any other place in Ontario because it won't compare. Taste is spot on, freshness is there. Better than many joints in Halifax or Charlottetown. I'll be punishing these on the regular. This place is bad news for my health."}
{"text":"A sloppy, sweet garlicky mess of deliciousness.

There was a great Donair place in Kingston, Ont. that I used to frequent, and I haven't been able to find a Donair after moving back Toronto. I'm very happy to have found the Fuzz Box - The meat if soft, the bread is soft & sweet and the sweet garlic sauce was exactly what I've been missing for the last 5 years......

The prices are very reasonable (4.99 for a small, 5.99 for a medium and 8.99 for a 1/2lb large) and the guy working there was very friendly."}
{"text":"Just got back from Halifax and tried every Donair I could.  Fuzzbox was just...better; much better than any of the top Yelp rated donair places in Halifax and Dartmouth.  A whole lotta haligonians are coming to visit me next week and we are going to the fuzzbox for a great donair, because now they can see what one tastes like ;)"}
{"text":"The best donair, garlic fingers and donair pizza I've had outside of Nova Scotia...and probably even the best I've had ever. The chowder is also delish. Really well priced and the customer service is awesome."}
{"text":"Donair craving? Problem solved @ The Fuzz Box. Geniune east coast hospitality on the Danforth. I should have moved to the east end but it's well worth the trip even from Etobicoke. Donairs are excellent (although not quite as good as donairs in halifax). Try the deep fried pepperoni and haystacks cookies! Service here was excellent. Highly recommended. Will be back to try the garlic fingers and another donair."}
{"text":"I'm not from the East Coast but the Fuzz Box makes a mighty fine donair and that sweet sauce that everyone talks about is pretty good.  I'm looking forward to trying the pizza there!  Friendly people too.  Can't say I'm blown away but i'm happy they are in the neighborhood area."}
{"text":"The Donairs here are so addicting... I eat here far to often. I walked by this place many times before I realized it was a Donair place. The owner is really nice and always seems to be there. I am happy this place opened up in the area!"}
{"text":"I've never had a Nova Scotian donair in Nova Scotia (or anywhere else) before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but from what my friends tell me (and as you can tell from other reviews) this place is the real deal.

With 80s rock playing in the background, the donair was like nothing I have ever had before - spicy meat and sweet garlic sauce, a delectable combination on a soft, warm pita with onions and tomatoes.

The owner took my order - he seems like a cool dude. He was very friendly and chatty when he took my order, he brought the donair to me and he checked in to see how I liked it.

It was about $8 for a regular donair and a can of soda - a good deal.

After eating here, I now picture more than lobster when I think about East Coast food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to the Fuzz Box after what he described to me as no less than a revolutionary taste experience. 
I'm not a big donair fanatic to begin with, and with a name like the \"Fuzz Box\", which always makes me giggle, I had my doubts. I ordered a small donair to be polite. Since that first bite, I have dragged myself across town on several occasions to pay pilgrimage to this delicious treat. 
The soft, thick, perfectly toasted pita is the best I've eaten just about anywhere. The sweet aioli sauce mixes tantalisingly well with the savoury melt-in-your-mouth meat. There's a bit of fresh salad in the mix to relieve some of your guilt over this decadent dish. The quality is consistant.
By now, your mouth should be watering, and I hope for your sake that it isn't Sunday (they're closed)."}
{"text":"The food was really good. Service was great. The poor waiter / was alone and cooking and serving .Running like mad but held it together. The restaurant really needs some paint and a good cleaning, donaire meat was cooked on a grill and overdone but the food was really hot and tasted great. 
Will certainly come back.
Washrooms are not accessible but Subway  subs is just down the street."}
{"text":"DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER! Amasing, true to heart, original nova scotian goodies. Great food and no bull****. Everybody should try it once."}
{"text":"I don't know if I hyped myself up due to yelp reviews or I'm just not used to this sort of donair but I wasn't overly keen on this place. 

I found the meat to me very flimsy for lack of a better work and it made the bread soggy to the point of my plate just being one big mess.

The guy who runs the store also cooks so we had to wait a little while for our food, but he was a friendly chatty guy.

I was put off a little when I noticed a coffee maker on the corner of the counter with coffee in and mould floating on the top- not what you want to see in a place where your dinner is being made! 

I won't be returning here anytime soon but it was okay for an impromptu take out."}
{"text":"Tried it based on great reviews read here, and agree with all the reviews.
Food here is great, service is slow during peak hours.
Also, shop is small, only three tables as you saw in pic.
But...the food is indeed YUMMY, will for sure go back!"}
{"text":"Went back again and as i said i'm not a fan of the sweet sauce but i did like the donair so this time i got hot sauce on the side and added it.  me likey it this way, next time i'm going to get both sauces on side so i have a bit of sweet and hot.  the meat this time was moist.

I think the other review on Yelp and in Now magazine that described the sauce as \"jizz\" is a bit of a turn off.  I don't like jizz at the best of times and certainly not when i'm paying for it.  lol"}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast and had been dying to try this restaurant! Took my boyfriend who is from Ontario here for his firs taste of the East Coast flare and even he loved it! (Donair sauce is an acquired taste I'm told!) We had the garlic fingers and poutine. Both were amazing. Something in the poutine...something magical. I can't even tell you what it is but it made my mouth explode with happiness.

Neil, the guy who owns and operates this restaurant, is always there, very hard worker, great guy, and treats his customers right.

And one final note - the prices are phenomenal! Make the journey east to go to this awesome resto!"}
{"text":"This is as good a donair as you will get in Toronto. For those of us homesick Nova Scotians who are stuck here, it's a great way to eat something terrible for you and miss home just a little less.

The donairs are what you will expect if you've ever eaten on KOD corner in Halifax. I ordered a small (because Kent P. and I were on a donair tour of Toronto that day, so I had to save space) and it was small indeed. However, I think if you approach is as anyone should - that is, with the attitude that you'll order the largest that they have and then go home and pass out watching Passenger 57, you'll be just fine. 

The place is run by a wonderful dude from the Valley who knows what's going on, which also makes the whole experience much more enjoyable.

Let's face facts - it's in the totally wrong part of town. Plop it somewhere West of Spadina and I have to believe that it would double it's business. But I guess there's some authenticity to being so far east that it's crazy inconvenient to reach.

All in all an awesome treat for those of us feeling homesick."}
{"text":"The Fuzz Box absolutely lived up to expectations. It doesn't get any better than the Nova Scotian donairs at this place. I got a regular donair and I felt like I could eat another one when I was finished because it was that good! The meat was very flavourful and matched perfectly with the donair sauce. The owner of this place is a really cool guy and offered excellent food with great service and a friendly attitude. And remember it's cash only. Can't wait until my next visit!"}
{"text":"mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Delish! First time I had the donair, I was thrown off by the sweetness. Not what I had expected but I really liked it. I have been back a few times and typically I get the owner to ease up a little on the sauce as too much makes it a gummy, mushy mess. But oh so darn good. Had the crab cakes too. It was a daily special one day and I must say they were one of thee best crab cakes I have ever eaten. thick, fluffy, crabby, and with a crunchy fried coating. I dream about them. March to the Fuzz Box for really great food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It was my first donair and nothing like I expected. It blew my mind. 

I thought that it was going to taste some what middle eastern but it was nothing like that. almost sweet. soo sooo good. going back tomorrow"}
{"text":"The Fuzz Box is amazing! My boyfriend is originally from Nova Scotia and I spent a few years living in New Brunswick, so we both missed donairs and garlic fingers. One night my boyfriend asked on Twitter where we could buy donairs in Toronto and someone recommended The Fuzz Box. Seeing as it was relatively close to our place, we decided to check it out a few days later. We both ordered the regular donair and shared an order of garlic fingers. Both were delicious and my boyfriend was so happy to have a little taste of home in his new city. We enjoyed it so much we were back a couple weeks later for seconds. We will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars   

These donairs are $@!&)%$ incredible - my simple words can't do them justice so I will keep this review brief.

Just go and try them for yourself....

P.S. - Many say this is the perfect post drinking snack. Not sure about that...  something tells me I'd be finding that delicious donair sauce in odd places the next morning!!!!!!!

BK"}
{"text":"Five stars for this amazing spot in east York. I had a friend tell me about donairs in the west coast and I was trying to find them nearby Scarborough. This came up in my search results and we decided to make the trek. We parked across the street at the gas station as the street was crazy busy. It was about to close so only we were in there. A really friendly girl took our order and keep in mind they only take cash but that have an on site atm. I ordered the beef donair and we also got coleslaw. The donair was in a lightly doughy type of pita with beef, onions, and this sweet sauce. It was perfectly balanced. Taste was incredible. Very filing and definitely a good hangover food. The coleslaw was great too because it had apples inside which made it not taste so bitter. The owner was chatting with us and was super friendly. It was great to try some Nova scotian food. Apparently these donairs are different than the ones in the west coast but my friend said they were still fantastic. I'll definitely be coming back here for sure. For a donair, super donair, coleslaw, and two sodas it came to twenty dollars. So worth it."}
{"text":"As a Torontonian, I would assume that the east (east) coast or the Maritimes would only eat something containing seafood but I was wrong. It is a not-so recent discovery that I heard about this place, and how I got acquainted with my first Nova Scotian Donair. 

And so one day I decided to go the Fuzz Box for a Nova Scotian donairs because of how everyone's been raving about this place. About that time, the place was empty and the person who greeted me is some long-haired dude who is in fact from Nova Scotia. 

For a medium/regular donair, it was 7.99 along with Ginger Ale which was 1.25 - pretty expensive if you ask me though it was quite expected seeing that I'm still in downtown. 

The donair itself was actually good albeit a little too sweet side. As other Nova Scotians pointed out I guess it isn't an authentic donair but close enough. The pita contains  lean and crumby meat, onions, tomatoes, cheese and a very sweet sauce that makes the donair, unique with its flavour. I asked the owner what the sauce contains, at first I thought he won't share his secret recipe to me but he did. The reason why it was sweet is because they added condensed milk and a number of other things I can't remember. 

However, I think the owner really wanted to redo my order due to the fact that it was \"too sweet\" or maybe someone in the back has mess things up. He opted me to try the spicy version and at that time, I was hesitant enough to say it was good and there was nothing wrong with it. He then just gave me a small cup of hot sauce which adds a little kick to it but I did not really want hot sauce at that time. 

The service itself was not quite enjoyable as everyone pointed out but it was at least alright. I did not get any free maroons or something even though he wanted to redo my order. In fact he was mumbling in the back with someone, probably knowing that the order wasn't satisfactory to his standards (or something). I still have some preconceive notions that he might be racist, seeing that one of my friend was a Nova Scotian and had said that Halifax and the west end of it are filled with \"racist bigots\". 

Anyways as I finished my meal, the two other tables were filled with people and just left afterwards. This place will a potential visit to me in the future seeing that I would at least try out the pizza or pogo. 

I almost thought this place when I saw it for the first time to be some kind of sketchy place where you donate something you don't want to do..."}
{"text":"100% East Coast goodness.

I actually stopped in my tracks on my way home last week when I saw the sign for this place. 

Fuzz Box? Wha?
Nova Scotian donairs? Eh?

After seeing a review posted in Now (http://www.nowtoronto.com/daily/food/story.cfm?content=186324), I decided to pop-in for a pre-dinner snack. (I'm a filthy animal). I was immediately greeted by the owner, Neil, a native of Annapolis Valley, and had a pre-chow chat. He asked how I'd heard about the place, how surprised he was by the overall response and the increased response from the Now article. He seems like a genuinely nice guy who's pretty blown away by the traffic generated in five days. I think he said he's sold out of meat a few times already, so that's a good sign.

When it came time to order, I mentioned that I was no stranger to donairs, so I'd take one made to his spec to which he slyly grinned and said, \"But you've never had a Nova Scotian donair.\"

Well-played, Neil. 
Well-played.

Sure enough, it was a pretty damn tasty. It's pretty similar to a gyro, but with some spice kick to it and the sweet jizz. Seriously, the white sauce is known as jizz and it's sweet. Whaddyagonnado? At $6 for a medium, I had to order another ... and some Blueberry grunt. From what I understand, the latter is a basically a heated blueberry sauce with dumplings dropped into it as its cooked and, as it was explained to me, \"it's called a grunt because when you eat it *eyes rolling back into his head* you say mmm ... mmm ... good\" 

And it was.

Looking forward to going back to support the local business and try some of the delicious-sounding fried pepperoni."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to the \"Scotian Donair\" by a friend and she pushed me to try one, saying it destroys the Gyros.

So I found this place and luckily it wasn't far from my work and thought I'd give it a try.

I came in with no expectations. And to put it shortly, I was floored at how delicious the Donair was. I'm Filipino and, culturally, we have a sweet tooth. Their Donair filled all aspects of my taste palate from flavoured meat to sweet and creamy.

I'm definitely coming back and bringing my friends for a late night treat.

The 1lb Donair looks deadly!

Bonus Star to the owner, Dean, for being very pleasant to talk to and providing exceptional service."}
{"text":"Everyone who hasn't tried a donair before needs to! And while it is possibly the only maritime donair in the city, it still deserves a five star rating! I'm from New Brunswick and searched far and wide for donairs in the city. Many places claimed to be donairs but that's not the case since they mess up the recipe! Fuzz box is actually tastier than a lot of the donair shops I remember back home! 

The owner is a gem he is friendly and remembers his customers by name. I love coming here! Me and my friend used to come here sometimes four times a week to get a donair. If you haven't tried a donair or haven't tried FUZZ BOX do yourself a favour and try one. You'll be hooked :)"}
{"text":"I have been stopping in here since last summer shortly after they opened. It's nice to have a taste of home here in Toronto!! The food is always hot and delicious. The donair is my favourite but I have also had the donair pogo, donair pizza and the blueberry grunt is soooo good!"}
{"text":"4.5*
umm, I JUST ate here.  and it was delicious.
It's not quite a gyro.  It's a Nova Scotian Donair : )
Possibly only second to the Halal truck in NY (that one gets 5 stars).

Forced my buddy to drive me out here to try it- we got two regular donairs (medium sized) and garlic fingers with bacon- cuz well- that's what Yelp told me to get.
And it was DEEEEELISH.

Of course, we asked for extra white sauce- it's like.. not the type of white sauce i thought it was going to be.. I thought it would be more garlicky but it was almost sweet.  It was good- I asked for extra on the side.  Because yelp told me to.  But You really don't need it.  The Donair itself is moist enough- and I like my food pretty saucy.  I ended up trying to drown my donair to use it (still not a bad option).

I asked for hot sauce and it was REAL hot sauce- that was actually spicy- unlike the sweet or mild hot sauces you will get at other places.  Not sure what kind it is, but imagine like- Blair's chips, or a caribbean hot sauce- NOT tabasco/frank's or one of those hot sauces you get on your shawarma/falafel/pita wrap.

The breaded pita-like wrap was soooo soft and nice, the meat was nice and crisp and it was packed with other fresh tomateoey goodness too.  So highly recommended.

The best part is the dude at the counter- just a nice guy who made conversation with everyone in the place.

My friend also pointed out that the students from the school near this place created the artwork you see on the walls- bonus points.

Go.
Eat."}
{"text":"I was curious and went there to give it a try due to the high reviews on yelp. First I couldn't figure I was in the right place as there was no sight of the Donair meat cooking away but find. The menu looked quite easy and went for the classic. Probably due to my ignorance of Nova Scotia Donair, I am not sure I liked it. It was a kebab with sweetened white sauce.  It was OK but I am not sure I would go for another one due to my taste. This said the staff was sort cool and friendly, service was great and all was wrapped nicely and tight for a later messy tasting!"}
{"text":"This place is serious! So hard to find a donair that is even close to those out East. This one does what all others have tried but failed miserably. Every bite was like heaven. The sauce is so perfect, the meat is so tasty and the pita was the best I have ever had. I found myself slurping up all the left over gooey drippings. Be warned these babies are messy, but you will appreciate being able to lick your fingers to remove every last drop of deliciousness!  Thank you The Fuzz Box for getting it right and making me feel happy in my guts!"}
{"text":"The only restaurant I've come across in Toronto that serves East-Coast style donairs and garlic fingers and gets it right! I love taking friends there and introducing them to this comfort food from the maritimes. The owner has been there every time I've went and he is super friendly and hospitable. The donairs are delicious and it definitely hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Never had a Donair before dining here, but now I can't stop going to this place. Each time I place the Fuzzbox's ever-so-glorious food in my mouth, I'm transported to one of the best food experiences I've ever had for under $10. Try it!"}
{"text":"The by far best Donaira Restaurant I have ever been to in my Life!
I am a foodie, Critic, Epicurian with acredidited UN etc. World Wide Experience.  Consumers Choice Award Winner. I have to say 12 Words....Absolutely the Best Donaira and Accrutrimon I have experienced to this date.
This particular Owner, knocked it out of the downtown,  National Ballpark as far as I am concerned.  Move over Gyros. Move over Sharma.  This is by far the most important and tastiest Morsel and represented taste of the East Coast.....

Opps....Group of Morsels for an Amazing Price I have ever had On Toronto from Nova Scotia to this point in 25 years of experience in Ontario,  Toronto,  yet to date.!"}
{"text":"Tried donairs for my first time here and had no idea what it was or what to expect. It was a surprise to my tastebuds and took a few bites to get use to it but it was scrumptious. Tried their fries as well and they were delicious. I've gone back a few times and found that the very friendly owner (pretty sure he owns the place) makes donairs a lot better than the other 2. He doesnt skimp on the sauce at all and is a pleasure to deal with. Definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"I had a few questions before I stop here. What is donair? (I try something I didn't know) Why is on my list? I still don't know but I'm glad and three why is called the fuzz box.

So donair is spiced meat with donair sause which all tasted good. Seem originate on the east coast, Nova Scotia. The owner (atleast I think he was the owner) was from Halifax or just outside of it so it was authentic, well I assume I didn't even know what donair.Either way I loved it and it tasted great. 

Still have more to try like poutine or pizza with that suase so much to have. Will definitely make a few stops.


So the fuzz box is the name of band the guy was in , so cross promotional thing, it was also the name of first distortion pedal across to him. It explains the instruments. Thou not so much the art but interesting decor is something to talk about.

Also according to guy I think is the owner. It's official food of Halifax. Guess I got another reason to head east."}
{"text":"It was all and more than the other reviews. 1 thing made very clear a Donair is not a Gyro LOL and after having one it is very true. Excellent taste and don't forget the homemade fries. Service is great and friendly.  It is a must for Locals and Tourists like myself."}
{"text":"Better than I ever remember.

The first time I ever had a Donair was in Halifax, my girlfriend (at the time) and I drove across country with our friend Shawn to spend a week in Halifax. On our first night out in Halifax Shawn (a local native) introduced us to Pizza Corner. I was mesmerized all of the kids clamoring around the streets eating Pizza's, Donair's and even a Donair Pizza.

That is where I got my first taste of a Donair, that sweet sauce made me fall in love with Nova Scotia, so much so that I dreamed of selling all my possessions and immediately moving there. I obviously didn't but I did later returned  with my Girlfriend where I proposed to her. We have now been happily married for 14 years now (thank you Pizza Corner).

We returned to Nova Scotia once again for our 5th wedding Anniversary and our first stop was Pizza Corner for a sweet Donair, but to our disappointment it had lost it's flare. Was the Donair ever really that good? Was it young love that made it so much sweeter? Was it the fact that I was not 3 sheets to the wind drunk? I simply did not know.

Over the years I have tried Donairs at different establishments, many were too dry, too much onion and not enough sauce, or had hard bread that made them nearly impossible to chew. Like a junkie chasing that first high, I feared I would never again savor that first sweet taste of Donair I once had at Pizza Corner.

That was of course until I stumbled across The Fuzz Box, rated rather highly on yelp it called out to me. I questioned my decision to go, would this be another let down? If I was going to once again chase this beige pony of Donair sauce would this be worth it. I threw caution to the wind and ventured out during my lunch.

I was in Heaven, this was exactly how I remembered it. No dare I say this was better than I ever remembered, the bread was soft and fluffy, the meat was packed in full and the sauce, of the sauce. I final found it, I finally know once again what love is. 

Thank you Fuzz Box."}
{"text":"I liken my visit to the Fuzz Box to a going to see a blockbuster movie. You see all the trailers, you read the rave reviews, your friends hype it up but in the end it's all just a big let down. Perhaps it's unfair to the Fuzz Box as I have had this place bookmarked for ages, I had built it up to be something amazing, I now realized it could have never lived up to the hype. 

This was my first experience with Halifax donair and I must say I was pretty disappointed. My friend and I came here after having a few pints of beer nearby. We both ordered a regular size donair ($6.49) and decided to split an order of their home fries (based on the recommendation of the gentlemen behind the counter). The donair in my opinion was a heaping mess. The bread was not soft; the meat was dry, crumbly and seemed over cooked. It was drenched in a ridiculously sweet sauce that just threw me off; it was way too sweet in my opinion. There were onions and tomatoes in the sandwich but those flavours were all drowned out by the copious amounts of sweet sauce. Furthermore the whole sandwich had an insane amount of peppery flavour, which probably came from the meat; this, in combination with the sweet sauce was rather ghastly. 

The one saving grace was the order of home fries ($2.89) which consisted of hand cut potatoes fried to perfection and seasoned with a blend of magical herbs and spices. The spice blend gave the fries a great, addictive flavour. The gentlemen behind the counter certainly knew what he was doing when he recommended these. My only qualm with these is that like the donair they were very peppery. 

The place itself is tiny with a few tables to sit and eat. It has that hole in the wall vibe that I love. The service was nice and our food came out promptly. In addition to donairs they do have a selection of pizza, salads, and rotating specials. 

Overall I was disappointed with my first Halifax donair experience. Perhaps this was a good rendition of it and I just don't like donairs? Who knows? I will have to try some more donairs to figure that out, but until then I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Wow! This place truly deserves it's 5 star rating for delicious food at a decent price with excellent customer service. Chatted up the owner/cook and found out that he's from Nova Scotia (how authentic can you get?). He also plays guitar in his band named \"The Fuzz\". 

I ordered a small meat donair, a chicken donair and a donair panzarotti. He warned me that the panzarotti would take about 15 minutes but the thought of something that tasted like a deep friend pizza (his description) intrigued me and I agreed to wait. The aircon was broken so the place was hot. The owner gave me a free pop and said I could turn the fan toward me while he cooked up my order. When my order was ready I had told the owner that I was buying lunch for my friends and he happened to comment that my friends were going to love me for it. I thought to myself that was pretty presumptuous of him to say but he was absolutely right. 

My friends and I split everything so we could share. I first tried the donair panzarotti and man was it scrumptious! It tasted exactly like a deep fried pizza. I was in carb heaven. The meat donair tasted like a gyro except that the wrap was fluffier and the sauce was a little sweet, that makes it two thumbs up. Everything was filling and was good enough to feed four women. 

My friends and I all agreed that The Fuzz Box is a place we will definitely be frequenting."}
{"text":"Have tried them three times since the store opened; I made two other attempts and found them closed during lunch hour???? Anyway... yes they will fulfill a craving, but so will making them at home and this is how these donairs taste. The meats consistency is sloppy at best as it's just bits of ground beef, the sauce ok... As said will fulfil a craving if you have not had one in a few years, otherwise go online, find a recipe and tweak it until you found something you like.... This is what the owner did."}
{"text":"I'm glad I made the cross-town trip for this one. I didn't think I'd find a place so close to authentic in Toronto. The food will definitely give you an east-coast experience and keep the cravings at bay until your next trip home. That's the short story. Now some nitpicking if you're still interested haha.

The prices weren't bad. I got a small garlic fingers for 5.99, a small donair for 4.99 (plus a little extra for cheese I think), and a can of coke zero for 1.25. 

The garlic fingers are so close to right. The sauce is perfect. The crust has the slight undercooked doughy centre like every place I've ever eaten them at in NS. They got the oregano on top that even crappy places on the east coast forget sometimes. The only minor complaint is that the cheese is wrong. They try to give you cheddar, I stopped them on that and got mozzarella. The mozza isn't quite right, though. It is pressed, not stretched. There was enough of it, though, to make that stringy mess I was craving. It was just a slightly different flavour and chew factor. 

The donair was a little farther from authentic, but close enough that I'm still giving the place 4 stars. What was right was the basic form. Pita, meat, sauce, onions, and tomatoes with the option of cheese. I'm glad they skipped the lettuce and tzatziki that other imitators try to squeeze in there because those things have absolutely nothing to do with donairs. Breaking down the ingrediants, though, is where the small problems arose. A Greek pita was used. It is supposed to be a Lebanese pita. As I ate I tried to figure out why the substitution. My first guess was it makes it easier to pick up for Torontonians who don't understand this meal isn't meant to be picked up like a sandwich. My second guess was maybe they tried the Lebanese one and it was too tough. If that's the case guys, just wet it and heat it. That'll get it where it needs to be. The sauce was pefect again. The cheese again was not right. Needs Saputo or something similar. The meat had too much oregano, too little cayenne, and I'm pretty sure it tasted of textured soy protein (I've spent years trying to perfect vegetarian donair meat and this was eerily similar). The texture of the meat was about the same as places in NS that bake the loaves instead of roasting on a spit so it's ok. The final thing I noticed was that the donair wasn't put into an oven after it was assembled. This doesn't allow the cheese to melt or the sauce to get to that magical place where it just starts to break (gross, but delicious, trust). 

Since I'm being so picky I should probably say I've lived all around Nova Scotia for 28 years and only arrived in Ontario a few months ago so my memories of the real thing are still pretty fresh. Oh, and don't call me Scotian. I hear it like a slur. It's pronounced Nova Scotian. Thanks."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and the food is consistent.

I'm not sure if it's just the one guy or if he has help sometimes, but every time I've been there it was the one dude cooking, serving, and dealing with the register. This can be a bit of an issue when it's a rush, like at lunch time when it's full of the kids from the high school that's down the street.

Anyway, I have something to compare this place with since I was in New Brunswick for about a year and ordered donair pizzas many times, and even purchased a bottle of donair sauce one time.

The donair at The Fuzz Box is fine. The sauce is normal donair sauce--I can't really say if they make it themselves, or if they have a local source for ready-made sauce, or if they import bottles of it from the east coast, but it does taste like generic donair sauce.

All you really need to know is that their donair is just a weak gyro with donair sauce. It's not special, and it's overpriced by about 40%. Some people who like donairs might think it's a perfect donair, and that might be true. I'd personally go a wee bit farther down the street (20 minutes of walking), and get a gyro from Messini's. Feel free to add some donair sauce on top of it."}
{"text":"Being as I'm originally from Halifax, this place intrigued me.  So I sought it out, and was very impressed.
It was messy, it was delightful!
Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"After seeing a review in the weekly Now, and seeing this place is in my 'hood, I decided to give it a go today. I ordered the poutine and regular Nova Scotia donair, both to go. Couldn't wait to get home to try them both. When I ordered the poutine, was told it was made with home fries..cool idea! The donair was yummy..just the right amount of sauce, onions, and tomato to compliment the donair. The donair meat was yummy and I plan to be back to this place soon hopefully and try some of their other offerings, like the fried pepperoni and the garlic fingers to name a couple of things I want to try. I went in the early afternoon, and there were only 2 other people there at the time. I met the owner, Neil, as he was manning the cash. Hoping this place does well!"}
{"text":"Took my sister here because she has been craving east coast donairs.  Donair overall was pretty well done - pita nicely steamed great garlicky sweet sauce.  But meat was disappointing - dried out.  Service was very friendly but soon slow.  Took ages for our food and they didn't bring out drink order till the end.  Also clam chowder which was pretty good came with lovely soft bread but they burned the outside which ruined it overall.  Disappointing because it was close, but a miss nonetheless."}
{"text":"After a week on the east coast, and learning most of my coworkers didn't know what a donair was, I found the most authentic place in the GTA I could and started a lunchtime field trip to introduce them to this eastern Canadian delicacy.

Location/ambience:
- Definitely a little out of the way on the Danforth east of Donlands, but no big deal (can't really blame them for DVP traffic), and a bit light on decorative touches, but nice, clean, and we were able to get a table to seat all 7 of us, so all good.  Parking on the street was plentiful and cheap (about $1 an hour). Washrooms downstairs were clean.  Score: 4/5

Food/Price:
- Ok, the reason we came.  100% the best donair I've ever had.  Granted, most of the east coast ones were from Greco, so I still need to compare these to the original King of Donair sometime (haven't had one from there in 15+ years), but the owner is from Nova Scotia and he knows how to make these right.  They blow Greco out of the water.  The wrap is soft and warm, the meat melts in your mouth, and there's just the right amount of sauce, which was just the right sweetness and not too garlicky.  It does get messy, as these things often do, but that's all part of the fun.  We had the 1/2 pound version - they're around $9 bucks. Score: Is there anything higher than 5/5?

Service:
The owner is a friendly guy and came around to check on us and bring napkins, etc.  Only negative is they only take cash, but fortunately it wasn't an issue for us and there are ATM's nearby.  Score: 4.9/5

Overall: I'm coming back here for sure.  Will need to try the garlic fingers next time!  Score 5/5."}
{"text":"Good ol' Nova Scotian Donairs!

When i went out to halifax to visit some buddies who were going to school there i was introduced first to garlic fingers with donair sauce.  it was amazing, this sweet sauce that made perfect sense with this buttery, garlicky, bread...yum yum yum

Then i had the real stuff, the donair itself and man.......i went to heaven for a second there.  After the visit i could not find a donair anywhere in TO that was made like that.

Well the wait is over!!!! i saw reviews of this place and i knew i had to go and find out for myself if this was the same donair i had out in Halifax.

My buddy and i stopped by Saturday and got 2x super donairs.  I ordered them and the guy in the front asked me if i tried these before, i answered him that i did try them and haven't had one in about 7 years! the dude was super nice and seemed like he was from out east.

when the donairs came i went to town and yup....that delicious sauce that i remembered...of the milky goodness....was perfect! this was what i was missing out on for 7 years but now...IT'S BACK!!  The meat they use was so flavourful and packed alot of spice.  combining the succulent meat with the milky sauce, whoa whoa whoa get your head out of the gutter, is like Batman with his Joker.....perfect combination! 

The place was plain and nothing special but it wasn't about the place...it was about the food here and it was top notch.

These guys have a special place because nobody is making this in TO...people go try a real donair...it is a must, do it now!!!!

I will definitely be coming back as often as i can and i want to try out the other food on the menu because it also looked delish!!"}
{"text":"Incredible donair!! Friendly service, real Nova Scotia style donair with real Nova Scotia radio station playing! A must eat of you're in the area and into donair. The decor is very cool. The owner and cashier are extremely friendly and happy to help you pick out a delicious meal. Check out their daily specials!"}
{"text":"After the initial wave of nerds taking pictures of their food was done this place kept up delivering great food and I constantly get cravings to go back at all hours of the day.

If you think you've had a Donair from a falfaell or Gyro place you haven't had anything.  Go here now and treat yourself to something nice. 

Try the garlic fingers or fried pepperoni on the side also."}
{"text":"Trailer Park Boys introduced me to donairs, among other things Nova Scotia. Living in Toronto though meant years of wondering what a donair is like... until The Fuzz Box showed up. The owner's from the east coast and they display that fact proudly here--hard to miss the storefront with the 'Scotian flag.

A simple-looking place, and I had no idea what to expect. But holy crap it's sweet and creamy and jam-packed yummy.

Many have raved about the authenticity of the donairs served here (which must not be confused for a gyro, shawarma, or other wraps). Until I can make my way to the Maritimes and find out myself (perhaps passed out behind a King of Donairs), we will have to make do with this piece of Nova Scotia in Toronto.

Toronto could definitely use some more east coast presence. Or one could pass out beside College Falafel, that might also work.

{TTC: just 'round the corner from Greenwood station}"}
{"text":"Amazing ... True Nova Scotian donairs in Toronto! As a Nova Scotian transplanted in Toronto for the last 23 years I always gorge myself on this tasty home delight when I return to Halifax for visits. Now I walk a few blocks and savor this taste of home anytime I want. 

Small simple surroundings in a yet to be gentrified strip of the Danforth.  The owner is great, East Coast friendly and checks in with every customer to ensure their satisfaction.  The food is delish! I've been there 3 times on the past week. For the sake of my waistline I hope I can exhaust my taste buds ... or take up running! (that's more likely). Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"So I finally was downtown in the area somewhat with my husband only to walk up to the door and have a hand written sign saying back at 4:30pm, yet the open LED sign was still on and it clearly states their hours of operations on their voicemail, website and yelp. What a waste of time. Not impressed and definitely not going back to waste gas and come to a closed establishment when they say they're open. If you close between lunch and dinner you should advertise it like sushi places do. Absolutely ridiculous and absurd."}
{"text":"Spent my childhood in Halifax. Missed donairs and was happy to have found this place. No frills, just great donairs and friendly service.

Good job, Fuzz Box.

Will visit again."}
{"text":"First visit to this place today.
Service is awesome, the owner checks with us after he bought out the food to us. Really friendly atmosphere.
But only 4 tables inside. 
As for the food. We ordered the Garlic fingers and a Donair. Totally changed the taste on the garlic fingers with that Donair sauce. Towards the good side I mean. Never had a Donair before. Wasn't disappointed at all. Will go back again soon. Next time we will be trying the poutine and the pizza.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Updates......

Tried going there on April 11 6:30pm.....closed.
Then again on April 21 5:00pm.....closed.

Better call them first before going there.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

April 23

Went there today....this time the place was open.
Told the owner what happen before. And to my surprised, he admit they sometimes closes on Monday, because they ran out of meat, and it takes time to prepare. And with the pass Thursday, it is the same reason....out of meat. And today he ran out of dough, so there is no pizza or garlic fingers.....holy.
And at the end, he remind me to call before going.
Well, might as well, just because of his Donairs."}
{"text":"Finally this Nova Scotian girl found Donairs in Toronto! 

For those of you who have not had a true east coast Donair, this is the real deal! The owner is from the Valley aka Annapolis Valley and the The Fuzz is the name of his band, this was only supposed to be a promotion for the band but luckily enough for me and all of you, we can still get the tasty east coast treats!

I can't believe it took me over a year to discover this place, usually I have to go to Milton to get my donair and garlic fingers fix but not anymore! I have to say this place is much better then Halifax Donair in Milton, maybe because i grew up close to the Valley?

The prices are very reasonable, if not cheaper then what you can get in Nova Scotia. It's the best messy meal of the day! Hell ya to the sweet sauce!"}
{"text":"Excellent donairs. I was craving this Canadian delicacy at lunchtime the other day. There are only two other Toronto places I know have donairs - Hopgoods isn't open for lunch, and College Falafel just isn't that great... Decided to make the trek across town to check out the Fuzz Box. So happy I did! Was worth the lonnnnggg trip from the westside, lol.

The Donairs here are everything you want your donair to be. The meat was luscious. The sauce was perfect. The bread was superb, and the whole sandwich even survived the return trip to the westside without disintegrating or getting too smooshy. 

I lllooooovvveee donairs and I will definitely be returning to the Fuzz Box. The restaurant itself is super clean, bright, and welcoming. And the owner is such a nice guy - you can tell donair is a labour of love for him, he personally asked every customer in the place how they enjoyed their lunch. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time try, won't be the last. 
Essentially the food is good. Comfort food, and it will take you back to NS if you've had a donaire out east. 
I got the half pound classic, with all the fixings (sweet sauce, diced onions and diced tomatoes). I asked if they had hot sauce, and was warned that they'll put it on the side due to its heat. I said put some inside anyway and the side. I guess the east end of Toronto doesn't like spicy food, doubt it. 
The flat bread was hot, as well the meat. The meat was nice, full of flavour and combined with the rest of the package, tasted great. 
The half looks small when you get it, but it's more filling than I thought. 

My only issue? They half wrap the bread, and hold everything together with aluminum foil, so you have to hold it with the foil or it falls everywhere. This resulted in me getting a paper cut on my lip, when hitting into the sandwich. Weird I know.  I think they could have simply got a large bread, and wrap it better. This is Toronto, not NS, so bread options are abundant. 
I'd also like more hot sauce and no treat it like some holy grail. Lastly the cost is high. It should be 2-3 bucks cheaper for the sandwich, as I think this would impact how many return customers they get.  Otherwise they will loose people who consider options nearby, in the $10 price point. $10 for a simple, although yummy sandwich, is a lot. 

I'll return."}
{"text":"Great Donair.  Very well priced, the guy working there was helpful and friendly.  Store is hard to spot but worth looking for.  I will go back"}
{"text":"My wife hyped up Donairs having spent time in Nova Scotia for school and I've been dragging her back here for every excuse I can think of ever since we found it.  

Dude who runs the place is super friendly, prices are reasonable, and the Donairs are legit.  

Apparently he's just started delivery, so that could be dangerous."}
{"text":"Awesome sweet sauce. The best.
20 Yeats ago I was introduced to Donair in Hamilton.
I have been looking for a place that does Donair with sweet sauce in Toronto since then.
Keep up the good work I will be back again and again.

Sorry no picture it was gone before I could write this post."}
{"text":"This place is amazing I drive over 30 mins just to come here because it is soooooo good. So sad to be seeing this place go.... I found it to late and I really really home that Neil reopens on the west end of the city."}
{"text":"Dean is the happiest owner around!

After nonstop badgering from friends about the difference between the Scotian donair and doner kebaps, I had to frequent this joint. I was impressed at the quality of the food, for how small and cozy the shop is (read: seating max 20 people). 

The verdict? Definitely addiction worthy! The donairs range from small to regular to large and the garlic fingers were to die for! The donair sauce can be a bit on the sweet side, but you get used to it. Now, whenever I eat here (at least once a week if I'm in town) I always ask for an extra container to take home. 

Student get amazing deals, and the catch of the day is always interesting. It ranges from water buffalo, rabbit, fish cakes, trout, clams, and more. The rabbit is especially tasty; Dean treats thumper with respect. 

The one caveat is that it is cash only, but I don't mind when they also offer Club Ovahi. Ask Dean to tell you about his thoughts on banking. It's totally mind-blowing. 

For the month of May they also offer 5% off all orders since it's the one-year anniversary. Take advantage universe of Yelp!"}
{"text":"Super friendly owner originally from the East Coast. Food was a perfect mixture of salty sweet and spicy with a special hot sauce that was kept behind the counter."}
{"text":"**3.5 stars**

I moved into the area a couple of months ago and still haven't really gotten a chance to stroll around the neighborhood to see what's good.  Fortunately with the help of Yelp, I found this little fast food gem just minutes away from home.

Unless you are looking out for this place, you would probably walk/drive pass it without even noticing it.  Neither of us actually have had true Nova Scotian donairs before and didnt know what to expect, except that it's 4-5 star-worthy according to fellow yelpies.  We wanted check this place out since it IS supposed to be the best in town.  The Fuzz Box is a very simple joint with no fancy decors- just a few tables with chairs.  The girl behind the counter greeted us nicely and introduced us to the special of the day, which was a beef straganoff.  Thanks, but no thanks.  We were there for their infamous donairs!

Nova Scotian Donair: reg $5.99 (4/5 stars)
Seasoned beef served on a pita with tomatoes, onions, and added lettuce for crunch.  Oh, and of course... donair sauce!  This was definitely the first time and I was surprised to taste that donair sauce is SWEET!  Sounds a little weird, but it all goes well with everything else.  The beef is slightly overdone for me, but if this is the way it's supposed to be, then it's just my personal preference.  

Chicken Donair: $7.99 (3/5 stars)
Seasoned chicken breast in a pita, served donair style.  Same as the beef one, but the the chicken was a little bland.  Neither of us agreed it was worth the price.  

Service: (4.5/5 stars)
The girl was nice.  As we were eating at the table, she even came by to check up on our food and gave us napkins.

We noticed the sign on the window lists all the daily lunch specials before 4pm everyday!  One of the days (and of course I would forget which. ARRGG) had a donair and drink special for something like $3.99!!  Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"So dying for a Donair I looked up the best Donair place in Toronto. Like a missile...I hunted his place down looking to become \"one-with-the-Donair\". 

I hit the jackpot with this place. Definitely not high end but it's \"hi flavour\" to be sure. The place is tiny, maybe seating for 10-12 people. We were served in an un-air condition dining area by the owner himself. 

The Donair was amazing! The meat was hot & scrumptious. The tomatoes & onions were freshly cut and the Sweet-Garlic sauce was indescribable fabulous! It was thick, garlicky & delicious. The pita was fresh & I could eat another one right now!! So if you want fancy...don't go here. But if you have a hankering for Donair definitely go here!"}
{"text":"Had never tried donair before, great East Coast take on a pizza with this sweet sauce.  I'll make the trip back from Mississauga to The Danforth just for this type of food."}
{"text":"Donairs seem to have disappeared from Ontario nearly 2 decades ago, and having not had one since high-school, I was intrigued by the opportunity to try one again at The Fuzz Box. 

The owner/chef is a one-man-show, and explained that everything is homemade except for the bread. The result is (very) sloppy deliciousness. The sauce is runny, and sweet by design, which may nor appeal to everyone. And while a magazine article quoting the owner said it should be important to sauce a donair heavily enough to 'run down your arms', I would have opted for a lighter touch (especially if you are a first-timer).  \"On the side\" may be an even better idea.

The meat is very good, but other than the sauce, it only comes with onions and tomatoes, and could have used more greens to round things out (or at least dilute the sauce ratio). You truly can't lift this pita sandwich without making a real mess.  Like the other great plate of Halifax (lobster), you may want to bring a plastic bib. 

20 years since my last taste, I think my palate has moved on to appreciate the relatively more complex shawarma (the closest cousin to the donair), and your dollar will go further on Lawrence Ave. joints, where they all seem to sell 2-for-1. My bill for a medium size donair and a bottled root beer was $10, which is a little steep if you include the cost of drycleaning after your meal. 

But if you are determined to have a donair in Toronto, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Sloppy delicious East Coast \"street food\"... If you are looking for a place where good people make reasonably priced tasty food this is a place worth trying.

The donairs here are tangy and have zip. They are definitely not shy on the spices which is great, because the donairs are flavourful. The meat is moist and tender. The bread is soft. The donair sauce is sweet. These flavours make the donair a unique taste experience compared to shawarma and gyros. I also tried an order of garlic fingers as well, and it's what you would expect. Cheesy garlic bread, but done well.

Definitely curious enough about this place to try the donair pizza and/or donair poutine. They also have daily specials, student specials, and it's cash only."}
{"text":"Very good donairs. Owner was also very friendly. Definitely reccomened people try ATLEAST once."}
{"text":"Nice staff and great music. I found the \"donairs\" which is a Nova Scotia version of Arab \"shawarma\" or Greek \"gyros\" good but the sauce is too sweet and mayonaisey tasting for me. Nova Scotia had these in the 70's because I was there and remember having them - so its for real. The Arab sharwarma sauce (takini and/or hummus) or Greek gyros sauce (tsatsiki) suits me better or maybe just my taste - good meaty tasty quick lunch thats better than a burger. The ambience is a couple of garage sale tables and chairs in front of the counter but does the trick."}
{"text":"The Nova Scotian donair was super tasty.
Cash only, simple presentation, nothing pretentious just really good tasting sandwich."}
{"text":"As a Nova Scotian I have been reared on Donairs and this place does not meet the basic requirements for making Donairs. First, they do not have a meat spit, rather they make their meat in the oven in the form of a giant meat loaf. This would not fly out east and causes the meat to be dry and crumbly when the reheat / fry it. The place is not clean and they service is slow, although the owner is very friendly. I have banned myself from going here for over 2 years because even though I would love to have a Donair; I cannot give this place any of my business. I did not want to provide a negative review, however I cannot allow people to continue to rate this place high, when it does not deserve it. They claim to have Chris Brothers fried pepperoni, but it is some local pepperoni and just not the same. The crust for the Donair pizza is store bought and terrible. What this place does show is there is an appetite for Donairs in Toronto, as a well below average Donair shop seems somewhat busy and the reviews are somehow glowing?!?"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Not a fancy place. We're talking Danforth east of Greenwood here. The decor has a lot to be desired. But Neil, the owner, is so friendly! It's one of those \"for everyone\" type of places that attract families and hungry Yelpers alike. 

I ATE 
Duh. The donair! I know my gyros but don't ever call this a gyro. The milk cream sauce that they use to compliment the meat is sweet and savory all wrapped up in one tin foil pocket. Mmm. It completely hits the spot! Ladies, if it's that time of the month, run don't walk! Every craving will be satisfied here. 

I topped it off with the fried pepperoni and honey sauce. I think I liked it more than the donair! At least on your deathbed, you can thank your clogged arteries for this MSG masterpiece. Delish. 

Neil asked everyone how their meal was. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Nova Scotians are nice. Neil even gave me a free macaroon cookie. He's got the basics of great cusotmer service and specializing in one thing down. The Danforth needed a place like this and I wish him the best of luck!"}
{"text":"Best donair in the city. Made the east coast way. Really, really good value."}
{"text":"All I've heard about from friends in the maritimes is about how good a maritime Donair is. Well The Fuzz Box has made me a believer and I can promise you that I'll be back. Their Donair sauce is the one thing that absolutely ties it together. Don't waste your life, have a Nova Scotian Donair at The Fuzz Box."}
{"text":"I had my first Nova Scotian donair here! So, unfortunately I can't compare it to anywhere else. It reminds me of a shawarma that's a little lighter with a sweet, creamy sauce. I did enjoy it and would come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome Donair outside of Halifax.  Just came back from the East Coast and found this little joint, can't go wrong with the Super Donair at $9.  Same prices as the East Coast and just about as good as it will get here in Ontario."}
{"text":"The Fuzz Box is an excellent and affordable place to have a meal along the Danforth. Conveniently located just west of Greenwood Station, those traveling from near and far can enjoy a sampling of Nova Scotia's signature grub. Chance's are you'll be greeted by the owner and his saggy blue chef cap, which is just the beginning of an awesome experience.

Decorated with guitars and paintings, the interior is charming and inviting with a traditional fast food diner appeal. It's comfortable enough for 10-15 patrons at any given time. Service is nothing short of stellar, as the owner himself will advise each customer when their order hits the grill, and how long until their orders arrive. He's very polite, friendly, and attentive, making it worth the wait. A Nova Scotian radio station plays quietly in the background and there's a nice view of the street through the front window.

Must-try items:
Nova Scotian Donair
Garlic Fingers

The food comes in very generous portions, even when you order the small sizes. I'm pretty sure I'd have trouble finishing a medium or large sized Donair, or garlic fingers. The 'sweet sauce' is so delicious and addictive. Each bite is scrumptious, though it could get a bit messy (there's forks, knives, and wet napkins for that). 

I found myself wanting to try everything on the menu, the moment I left. Based on the fact that there are hardly any other Scotian establishment's in Toronto alone, this place deserves hidden gem status. Kudos to the owner for bringing the goodness to Ontario. Best donairs I've ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"Donair.. I never have a Nova Scotian Donair before until now.. 

Thanks, The Fuzz Box, now I know what's my new drunk food. A donair with well spiced grounded beef drenched with this addictive, delicious sweet and garlicky sauce. The wrap is warm, soft and moist with this heavy texture.

My original donair ($5.99) was just perfect. Biting into the donair with all the sauce, meat and tomato all splashing out. So good..

Rabbit Stew ($7.99) was the Special of the Day. A little peppery, a little creamy and really tasty.

The service is excellent! Personally and Friendly!

I will be back for more of those delicious donair.. I guess food taste better after a few beer... 

Cash Only!"}
{"text":"What is a Nova Scotian donair you ask? It's a sweet perfect melody between meat and sauce. Just go try one."}
{"text":"All east coast transplants should be getting on the TTC and not stopping until Greenwood and Danforth... and if you've never had an east coast donair, stop being silly and get thee to The Fuzz Box. 

I am first and foremost a Haligonian and I thoroughly enjoyed my donair and garlic fingers. The prices are the same as in Halifax, and the flavors spot on.

The meat is a bit crumblier and leaner, and they used orange cheddar on the garlic fingers but these were very minor variations. 

Welcome to Toronto, Fuzz Box, I'm mega glad you're here. 

PS: Next time I will try their donair pogo. Mmhmm."}
{"text":"I'm not from Nova Scotia. But I grew up in Edmonton. Donair sauce was a staple of my  teenage years. 

I went through severe donair withdrawl when I moved to Toronto. LUCKILY, there is FUZZ BOX!

Amazing donairs and DONAIR PIZZA! They do it right. You haven't lived until you've had donair-something. Period."}
{"text":"I know we're not in Halifax but I have tried donairs in 5 or 6 places over the years and this is by far the best. The meat has a nice taste and consistency, there is the right amount of the sweet sauce and the pita is soft and holds it all together. Some have complained about the messiness; what do you expect? I have succeeded in finishing it without needing a shower or a change of clothes. Neil, the owner/cook/cashier seems a bit harried but is always very friendly. Would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Im a repeat customer. Place is amazing. They serve the best donairs outside of Nova Scotia and, frankly, it's possible they're the actual best. I wrote about it after my first visit:
