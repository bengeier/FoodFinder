{"text":"Came here for dinner with a group of 10 - we all did the all you can eat dinner option. Our server was very nice - took our drink and food order promptly. Problem was the amount of time we had to wait before food actually arrived. It took about 20 minutes before we saw the first dishes. Then each time we ordered again, it took half hour for the food to arrive.   Food was okay. Nothing to write home about. This chefs special sizzling dishes were probably the better items on the menu. Sushi was okay as well. I personally am not a fan of their pad Thai so I would not order that. I did enjoy the mango and coconut ice cream that they served at the end. Disappointed that they don't offer red bean ice cream! :(  I really like the decor at this location and it is a great place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"Dinner with friends on Friday evening. Not too packed and service was great. Food portions were a bit small though I loved the Korean beef short ribs and the lamb in Thai red curry. Try it!"}
{"text":"This place is a chain, and so there are some antiseptic aspects about the experience but their food is pretty delicious. I loved the pad thai. The chicken was especially well done, very tender and moist, not dried out like some other places. The mango salad with chicken satay was also tasty.  Service was a little cold, but professional. A great place when you want a fancier Thai food experience."}
{"text":"Other than the first time I went to the Spring Rolls on Yonge with pals from my dorm, this was likely my favorite Spring Rolls experience. Much like most of their joints, you had perhaps one friendly and nice server out of a dozen, which was OK.  I ordered the vegetarian pad thai and was definitely in love with it. My friend ordered a beef pho. It was mildly overcooked. When you go to Spring Rolls, always order something spicy or sour, something more \"Thai\"."}
{"text":"I remember this Spring Rolls fondly because it was my first Spring Rolls experience. They have good salads and pad thai. It's been 6 years so I really shouldn't be writing about it as if I knew how it's like these days."}
{"text":"I am so glad I am not alone. There are better Spring Rolls spread across the city but this particular branch is awful. Their food is not up to standard. I was here twice and both times I didn't feel comfortable at all."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and nothing special.  Decor is very cheap and beat down, needs major renos.  Service is horrible. I've been here twice and each time they got everything wrong and didn't even apologize for it."}
{"text":"Worst sushi combo ever. I tried it twice..it is just horrible both times. It doesn't come with miso soup and salad, which is the first for the many sushi combo I tried. The fish is not fresh at all. You can taste the stinky fish smell in the sushi.. For $10 before tax, you can get much better sushi at lots of places."}
{"text":"I can only fairly apply this review to delivery I haven't eat in the restaurant in years but have noticed a lot of locations have closed down compared to back in its prime.  Two delivery orders in the past couple of months after not eating here for a good 3 years.  Both occasions I received cold and flavorless food.   Won't be wasting my money again.  Sorry and to add both times almost TWO HOURS for delivery."}
{"text":"If you want bland food served on dirty dishes then this place is for you! The only positive thing about this place was the waitresses were very nice and friendly. Seriously even the tablecloths were blotchy and stained."}
{"text":"Avoid this restaurant at all costs. This is probably the worst place you can go to if you expect any type of service. They have an all you can eat menu however they limit how many pieces of food you can order. For example you are only allowed one piece of lamb chop per order (that's two bites) and can only order another one after you have finished eating it. Also you should expect to wait 15 to 20 minutes between orders. They seem to do that purposely to make you waste your appetite.  Absolutely horrible experience... Tried it three times and it was consistently bad... Will never go there again."}
{"text":"I honestly like Spring Rolls, but the service at this establishment was kind of poor.   I went to the location at the Fairview Mall to catch up with friends and try the \"All You Can Eat\" option which sounded pretty cool. Our waiter was nice...at first. He told us about the $25 buffet style dinner (my friend and I had never had that before, our other friend had tried it) and we all got that. FAIR WARNING: If you go with a group EVERYONE has to pick either all you can eat or ordering dishes. Anyways, food started rolling out and honestly it was a GREAT experience! You can literally try anything on the menu as long as you finish it and everything is portion controlled so you have room to eat more.   Here's where things went a little left. I have a super fast metabolism so I get full fairly quickly but I obviously wanted to get my money's worth. After every plate I would take 5-10 minutes to digest before ordering again, obviously not trying to waste by ordering too much. About an hour in, my group wasn't getting served as much and we were waiting up to twenty minutes to be served. The waiter seemed annoyed when taking our orders and was clearly avoiding our table. It bothered me because he knew two of us were new to the restaurant and first impression are so important. Anyways, we finally get desert and they have these bite sized brownies that I really liked. Again, fast metabolism so I wasn't trying to eat too much too fast. When I ordered a second round of brownies, I noticed they were basically thrown on the plate. Even though they were cube shaped they had an obvious top side and he clearly wasn't worried about presentation when he sent them to our table. This was really passive aggressive behaviour on his part and by then, my group was ready to go.   We tipped an okay amount given the service and he seemed annoyed that we didn't give that much. I thought that was pretty extra, considering he avoided our table so much.   So yeah, service sucked but I enjoyed the food and didn't get sick (I also have a super sensitive stomach) so I would definitely return and have ordered from Spring Rolls since then!"}
{"text":"Like some of the other reviewers said, the service was slow and downright rude...never greeted, had to wait for ages to be served, got the classic eye-roll when asked for more info, and the food was, well, ...meh...I like the SR on Yonge St. much better, it's smaller but so is their attitude. Never again!"}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs.  Since its re-opening I've given this restaurant two chances, and unfortunately, there will not be a third. Both times I tried their All You Can Eat option, once for lunch and once for dinner. They are always understaffed, which leads to incredibly long wait times and having to get up and look for your server to get anything. Worse off, when the food does arrive, it is sub-par. The sashimi looks like it was hacked away with using a dull knife and the slices are so small. All their hot dishes are oversauced and too salty.   BOTH times I've gone I've had to request to speak to the manager after my meal to share my poor experience, and both times the management refused to admit their shortcomings and instead chose to explain to us \"how a restaurant works\". I recommend instead checking out Sushi Moto next door or Ichiban just around the corner. Just go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  This is one of the better Spring Rolls locations. Some of the food items (definitely not everything on the menu) is pretty good.   Highlights:  - They serve pretty good shrimp rolls. The shrimp rolls usually come out perfectly crispy on the outside and not too oily with a perfectly cooked and tender shrimp in the middle. The chicken pad thai and wonton soup are also my favourites.  - Generous portion sizes.  - You can dine in or take out.  - Service is usually pretty good. I'm giving it a B+ because I have noticed that the service could become excruciatingly slow when it gets a little bit busy. Otherwise, I have to say that the service is usually quick.  Tips:  Check out the menu online and decide what you want before getting to this place. Their menu (aka Spring Rolls Yellow Pages) is way too extensive with over 97 items and 56 pages!!  Don't order sushi here. It's not their speciality and it shows.   Food: B+ Service: B+ Food presentation: A- Atmosphere: A- Prices: B+ Recommended? Yes"}
{"text":"To sum it up: mediocre food, rude owner, and cockroaches!! The only good service was from our waitress (Susan I think)."}
{"text":"Great chow mein! It was neat the way the crispy noodles became soft and somewhat chewy in the sauce. Plate was full of flavor.   Ho Fun - not that neat, but definitely edible.  Our waiter was pleasant. Overall, nice experience. And, neat lights inside. But I agree that it felt trendy and chic - but who cares - no one is going to judge you for eating here."}
{"text":"It's amazingly good.  The Pad Thai??? More like Pad-tastic!  Will go there again.  Now only if they could have some more good drinks.  It would be a better place.  But for now no other Asian place for me."}
{"text":"This place seems to be always packed with people every time I walk by. Being Asian and all and knowing what REAL Asian food tastes like, I've finally pulled myself together to try this \"Asian Fusion\" cuisine. Service was prompted and welcoming but food-wise...... I can say that I've had better. The food here is basically the same as what you can get at those Chinese fast food places AKA the famous Manchuwok but pricier with fancier plates that tickles yours eyes with good presentation. I believe I can get better food in Chinatown that's half the price of what I get at Springroll. The food was pretty tasteless and didn't really satisfy my taste buds at all. Seeing all the people here I really had expectations for good food but I'm assuming the people eating here have no idea what good asian food really is. I wouldn't say the food was terrible but it wasn't great as I hoped. I got the Char Grilled Korean Galbi and Tiger Shrimps since it was the staff recommendation. The meat turned out to be very chewy and fatty while the tiger shrimps were dry and over-cooked. The only good thing here was the alcoholic beverage \"Springroll-lini\" consisting of alize and vodka. I know now that I will most definitely not be coming back here to full-fill my Asian cravings."}
{"text":"In short: I will not be coming again  My friends and I went to Springrolls on Family Day, perhaps that was the reason our server was rude. There weren't many people there when we sat down (maybe 3 or 4 tables) so we hoped service would be good, and the food would come fast.  We were wrong, my friends sat down and the waitress quickly came to ask us what drinks we wanted, we haven't even opened the menu yet - nor did we get the drink menu. We told her water, she got it, came right back to ask us what we wanted to order. Like I said, we still haven't opened the menu - she came back 5 seconds later to ask us again.   We had all you can eat lunch, and the food took a long time to come, at least 15 minutes. Slowly the food started coming in, and we wanted to order drinks. We looked around for our server for five minutes, and couldn't find her. Eventually, we asked another waitress and she went to find our server. She came back a bit pissed off, and we ordered drinks(pepsi). She came back, with one drink and didn't give us the other drinks until we reminded her.   Then we wanted to order more food, since it was all you can eat, and we only ordered once. We couldn't find her again, so finally when she came to drop off a Tom Yum soup and we asked if we can order. She was holding a soup on her tray and instead of a nice \"of course, I'll be right back\" she raised her voice and said \"can you let me put this down first?\" My friends and I were shocked. She came back and continued to be angry and said \"If you want to order, just call me okay, my name is xxx.\" I would have loved to have called for her, if only we could find her. During my whole lunch, I only saw her for a maximum of five times. Seriously, she needs to adjust her attitude.   Other than that, the food was mediocre. The spicy sauce on salmon rolls were not the ones you usually get from sushi restaurants, it was sriracha. The mustard that Chinese people usually eat with dumplings were not \"chinese mustard\" instead if was regular mustard - the ones you eat on hot dogs. Our tuna sushi rolls tasted like they came out of a can, and they were cooked."}
{"text":"Final year at Ryerson University, so yes, I have been here a fair number of times in the last few years, since its right across the street. Me and my friends keep coming back here. Great for both all you can eat and regular. Generous quantities and good food. I believe I have always gotten good service here, no bad experiences come to mind. The Malaysian Spicy Fried Rice and hot and sour soup are my go to dishes."}
{"text":"Left at the front door for half an hour. I saw empty tables. \"Just a minute\" every time, how about just one star.   Maybe my skin color was wrong. Oh well."}
{"text":"Loved this place...very good service.Quantitys are so perfect that we can try different dishes without wasting anything in All you can Eat buffet.Love to go this place again n agsin"}
{"text":"Awful waitress name Zoey. Adequate food, but will not visit again. Forced customers to pay 15% gratuity while they deserve none."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls does a good job in creating a nice ambiance and they're definitely in a great location, but the food sucks.Go to Congee Queen or even Mandarin if you are craving Chinese food.  Chinese food, even if it's been westernized, should always be hot and the food here has always been cold. The prices are more expensive, yet the quality is inferior to other Chinese restaurants and the quantity is small."}
{"text":"Awful. We stopped in here for dinner over the holidays. I ordered the lime iced-tea to drink and there was so much lime in it, I couldn't drink it. And I love lime! I ordered the Har-Gow dumplings to start. Good. Very standard and obvious they were not made in-house. The veggie spring rolls were good too and obviously made elsewhere. I ordered the General Tao chicken for my main and I've never tasted anything like it. Watery, and not slightly reminiscent of the many Tao I've had all over North America. My other half ordered the neon red Pad Thai. I call ketchup and artificial color! The tempura fried cheesecake tasted like a cheap them park funnel cake. Our server was very eager and attentive. Head next door to Oja instead. The food is great and you get bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Eek! Methinks never! This place just makes me upset. If it wasn't for the fact that The Keg wasn't open for lunch (what's wrong with having a steak for lunch?!) and the crazy down pour of rain, I wouldn't have gone.  My friend and I settled to try out the dim sum. Mistake (this whole thing was a mistake actually).  Their steamed tiger shrimp rice roll (DS31) was outright insulting. The rice roll itself was dry and thick so when it was rolled it actually tore. Tore. I've never seen rice roll tear. When we tried to pick it up, the rice roll fell apart in pieces. Inedible. I don't know how the rice roll itself falls apart in pieces since it's basically a sheet rolled up. I've never returned a dish but we had to, they shouldn't have brought it out in the first place.  The fried eggplant stuffed with eggplant mousse (DS61) was alright. Nice crispy edges on the eggplant, the sauce is good but really oily. We could see the layer of oil on top of the sauce. Guess they don't skimp out on the oil.  Their lobster avocado salad (DS A9) was good in concept but just poorly executed. It's basically large chunks of lobster & avocado with a sweet mango salsa. The avocado wasn't ripe so it was hard and the cooks in the back came across as chop-lazy as almost all the avocado pieces weren't cut through - they were half cut so they were still stuck together. We cut ended up cutting them in smaller pieces.  Their chicken chow mien (DS W2) was too salty so we left it unfinished.  The pork & shrimp dumpling and the shrimp dumpling were okay at best.  Should have went to Boston Pizza. This is what Layton would call a 'hashtag fail'."}
{"text":"The soups  we ordered not even warm.  The  rolls with too much  sauce.  The dimplers horrible!  Poor food quality for the price. Will not return."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is a chain, and everyone should know that when it comes to chains:  1. The food quality and flavour isn't something a chef can really dictate over, its up to headquarters and; 2. The usually get super busy on weekends, especially if located near a movie theatre. Movies + 30 minutes to down a dish = busy restaurant.  That being said, going to this restaurant lunches, brunches and weeknight dinners is a pleasant experience. The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous and it can cater for all age groups and group sizes. I think that's fantastic.  A few weddings have actually been held here (receptions, of course), and no wonder, the place at night with the votive candles looks better than any other restaurant I've seen north of Bloor.  I think the reason why this restaurant has so many low ratings is because those with an 'asian palate' (those more experienced with Asian cuisine) expect too much from a pad thai from this restaurant. It IS a fusion restaurant, NOT a thai restaurant  - the mango salad will be different to the hole in the wall you ate mango salad at every day in college!!!!  A Pad Thai in my eyes has always been an unworthy dish of carbs on carbs with a handful of protein to save it's sorry ass, so I hold no sympathy for those who order it in a fusion chain restaurant. A pad thai to me will always be bad, so pad thai complaints I don't think should be held against this restaurant.  Why not try the delicious Chicken and Vegetable dumplings? They are definitely one of the best appetizers (the other contender being the Calamari).  Also, the coconut icecream is the BEST, and I NEVER liked coconut before trying it. It has real pieces of coconut flesh in it, so when the ice cream melts in your mouth you get to chew on the coconut flesh.   The server named Mark (Marc?) is cute and awesome, give him a wink from me!"}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is a pretty reliable just-a-notch-above-fast-food standby for people who aren't selective about their food but are willing to try something asian (if that's you, then go ahead and eat here, but just know that there's much tastier asian food out there!). If this review was on taste alone it would get fewer stars. The thai dishes and chicken dishes (I haven't tried many of the other meat dishes) range from just ok to on-the-bland-side. They're not trying to knock your socks off with amazing or authentic flavor. But they do try to have a pleasant atmosphere, fancy design and consistent service, and sometimes that's just what you want. They also have big party rooms available with reasonably priced set meals with crowd pleasing options, where you can take a bunch of people to eat without breaking the budget or scaring off the non-adventurous eaters."}
{"text":"I don't know why I ever order from this place anymore. I always order delivery and when it used to come from the Yonge-Bloor location, it was always pretty good.  But ever since I moved near this location, the food has been horrible. I swear the Pad Thai (their signature dish) I got tonight had zero flavor. It was just a bunch of red noodles and chunks of chicken. There weren't even any peanuts.   If this were the first time, I would call and complain, but this has been going on for months. What a waste of money! With 50 million other Thai places in Toronto, go somewhere else. These guys were great, but it's time for them to go out of business."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, I was a fan of the triple cheese dumplings.  The lettuce wraps were okay but didn't come close to PF Chang's (sorry Canada, I know you still don't have a Chang's yet).  The sweet and sour chicken was decent.  Standard new asian restaurant procedure -- start with something simple and if they mess that up never return...  at least they didn't mess it up!  Nice interior decor.  They separate this place into two main sections.  I was a party of 6 and they told us that this limited us to the curtained off section that was basically in the lobby of an office building.  Attentive service -- I think our waiter asked us 4 or 5 times if everything was okay.  That seemed like a little much to me.  Also, though this place seems like it may have an upscale corporate restaurant feel, they are apparently above free refills on soft drinks."}
{"text":"Not very good. Came in hungry. Found out there was an all u can eat for $16. Made decision on an empty stomach so did the all u can eat.  Tried about 13 dishes. Only 3 out of 13 was decent. 1) fried calamari,  2) gyoza 3) beef green curry. Even then the dishes was sub par. Also, their all you can eat has so many conditions to it too. You can only order 5 at a time, you will be charged for any extra waste, $2 extra per person if you want an additional premium menu."}
{"text":"Its always very busy at noon. But the service was still fast and friendly. I liked the bento Box with Salmon Teriyaki though it has not much to do with bento...  The prices are reasonable and you get a huge selection of foods.  Very noisy!"}
{"text":"Food is good and tastes fresh! Seems aimed more toward those who prefer \"canadian-ized\" Asian foods. I have only ever ordered delivery off the website, never ate in the restaurant. My only complaints are that the food is not really consistent in the sense that I've had the same menu items more than once and they seem to come prepared slightly different each time. Perhaps it depends on the chef working? Nonetheless they should really be on the same page with the recipes, people like to know what they're getting, especially if they tried it once before already.  Examples of inconsistencies:  Teriyaki Udon Noodles w/ Beef came with losts of bean sprouts and greens once, the next time I ordered the same, it came with less bean sprouts, greens, with black pepper and seaseme seeds sprinkled on top. If I was someone who did not like or was allergic to pepper/seaseme seeds in my noodles, I would have been super pissed off seeing as it didn't come that way the first time and no special instructions were given.  Lastly, with my first order ever from here I tried the Tom Yum shrimp soup. The second time I ordered, I asked for Tom Kha shrimp soup (w/ chives), however what I received seemed no different from a Tom Yum soup. Now my 3rd time ordering, I asked for Tom Kha shrimp soup (w/ chives) and received what still looks like Tom YUM soup and with Chicken instead of Shrimp? I'm wondering if this place just puts whatever soup they feel like with your order at this.   Will still probably order from here again since food is overall good, and the minimum order for delivery is reasonable if you're close by and ordering for just yourself."}
{"text":"my friend and I (wo girls) came to the location on 40 dundas street tonight august 24th at around 9pm... the HOSTESS was very rude.  We gave our name and was told the wait would be able 10-15 minutes so we sat down on the bench outside the restaurant and could see and hear everyones name being called when the tables were ready. after 15 minutes we went to check if we had been called and this young maybe 20s women said we had been called. she blamed her manager saying that he went out and called our name and blamed us as well for not hearing him insisting we must have went for a walk when we didnt.   my friend and i said no problem can we just have the next table for 2 then.. as this is usually what anyone with good customer service would do. but she insisted we are placed last on the back of the list and there are now 7 in front of us! I tried to say that we have been waiting cant we have the next table for 2 and she was rude saying 7 in front. then she sarcastically said ok im being nice here and how we can get next table but will still be another 15 minutes or more.. she was very sarcastic and snippy. i hated her tone and she was very rude and passive who gives attitude ..not very nice greeter at all for a resturant! we walked out and went to the pickle barrel right after! it was great. will not be returning to this location and neither will any of my friends."}

{"text":"What a great restaurant, I have been to a few of their locations. The Pad Thai is to die for, The shrimps wrapped and served in a Martini glass is fantastic. Take a trip to Thailand with out your passport and no need to break the bank either. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Very slow service.   I try not to give bad reviews, but after eating here tonight I just had to. The staff was nice, but incredibly slow! Especially since there were only five other tables dining and three wait staff around. Waited 15 minutes to get our drink / food orders taken, another 10 to actually get our drinks.  The food: the $3.50 fried black pepper and salt calamari that comes with your beer/martini was not bad, considering the price.   I ordered the red curry with chicken. Got a nicely presented, but entirely flavourless dish. The curry was heavily diluted with absolutely no taste. Essentially, nicely cut vegetables and chicken in red cream. I feel nauseous just thinking about it. My friend ordered the General Tao, and described it as \"very meh\". Being good first generation Canadians, we ate our protein and got our cheque, but left feeling cheated out of a meal.  Hungry? Do yourself a favour and head to another restaurant - for Thai? Bamboo Legend (though not located in the square one centre area) serve up delicious dishes for the same price. For sushi? Check out Odai Sushi by Heartland - you won't regret it. You will leave there with your heart happy and your tummy full."}

{"text":"Want to visit the restaurant equivalent to a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.. as in all style no substance? You've found the place!  I abhor all the Spring Rolls franchises that i've visited over the years. The one in Mississauga, the one downtown at Yonge/Bloor. They're all the same. Every single time that I'm forced here by circumstance (coworkers) I'm treated to probably the worst asian food. Pricey without any taste. Even Manchu Wok has a leg up on these guys.  Now don't get me wrong. If you want to impress some none-asian friend to a fancy place that is stylish, clean, then by all means waste your money here. However if you want a decent asian meal, there are so many other choices.  Food: 1 Service: 4 Ambience: 5++ Overall: 1 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"food okay but inconsistent in quality.  sauces taste store bought.  veggie spring rolls very bland."}

{"text":"I went here for  dinner the food was great and the  service was awesome .Had the all you could eat every time I was ready for my next dish it was there in a flash    service was excellent.The atmosphere was very classy as well. I think this place is least worth experiencing once."}
{"text":"They are hit and miss here. I have came here a few times for the all you can eat lunch or dinner. Pros -nice cocktails  -like the mango salad -Clean restaurant  -wait and serving staff amazing  Cons  - little flies always flying around your table gross - bathrooms need to be maintained more often - sometimes meat tastes unclean -sushi subpar  -desserts for all you can eat tasting menu suck - prices high   The food is OK.  It's not an authentic restaurant so what you get is what you get."}
{"text":"Obviously, not a traditional Thai restaurant, but the food at Spring Rolls on Eglinton is delicious! The Tom Yum Goong Soup is a great starter, or if you prefer something crispy, their spring rolls are filled with flavor. I've tried a number of their main dishes, including the Famous Phad Thai, Eggplant and Beef , Tango Mango Chicken,  and the Grilled Fillet of Atlantic Salmon with mango salsa sauce. All of these dishes satisfied the pallet. So far, it seems like everything on the menu is equally delicious, it just depends on what you're in the mood to taste and enjoy.    A relaxing and esthetically pleasing atmosphere with great martinis. The waiters are vary friendly and do not rush you off after you've finished eating.    I recommend this restaurant for group dinners, romantic dinners, and a place to go for exotic and tasty drinks."}
{"text":"For the thirty bucks a head for all you can eat, this is the worst service I've ever had. My group say there for over five minutes before anyone even took our drink order.  And it only got slower from there.   The food is about what you'd expect for buffet Chinese, but it seems their business plan is to feed you so slowly that you get so impatient that you leave before your full, with food coming sporadically over time despite things being ordered at the same time, if it comes at all.  Multiple times we had to order food for a second time because it never came."}
{"text":"My husband and I always come to this location for the all you can eat menu... and always leave completely stuffed.  We have always had a pleasant experience here and the food has always been very tasty!"}
{"text":"Came here with my sister-in-law and niece for AYCE weekday lunch buffet. The hostess told us it was $15.99 each and $3 for kids under 4. I should say now that it is NOT a kid-friendly place like other reviewers stated.  So before we were seated my SIL decided she wanted AYCE & I was considering just doing a-la-carte because I wasn't that hungry, but saw the AYCE price was just a couple dollars more than some a-la-carte items so I went with AYCE as well.  It wasn't until we read the fine print in the menu after being seated did we read that if one person wants AYCE, *everyone* must order AYCE.  The hostess made no mention of this so had I wanted a-la-carte, I would've been forced to do AYCE. The menu also had one panel that specified an extra $2 charge for items on that list (eg. sizzling platters + sashimi + special rolls) so we avoided items on that list as $15.99 was our limit.   We were very careful to read the fine print in the menu to avoid any \"extras\" given our limit. So it was with great surprise when, after we had decided on dessert, our server decided to *then* inform us that dessert was $2 per person extra AND, like with the AYCE, if one person wants dessert, *everyone* will be charged the $2 per person extra. Not only that, it was $2 on my niece's $3 kiddie AYCE charge, which is just incredibly disproportionate. That, in itself, was incredibly annoying and shady because I didn't even really want dessert and the $2 extra for dessert is not advertised anywhere in the menu or restaurant. Of course by that time, my niece had her heart set on dessert so we all ordered *something*. We ended up ordering 2 brownie bites, 2 mango sticky rice, a lemon mousse, the frozen fruit & grapes on a skewer. First off: the mango sticky rice was ~1/5cup of plain+unseasoned sticky rice in a blob shape drizzled with about 1/2Tablespoon of coconut milk and served with a 1\" x 2\" piece of mango. I wish I were exaggerating but that is literally what we got. The description said the mango sticky rice came with 3 pieces so having been served 2 blobs of sticky rice with 2 slivers of mango leaves me confused as to what the 3rd piece should've been. That's just weak. The description for the frozen fruit said it came with a chocolate drizzle, which was nowhere to be found. The frozen grapes also had seeds, FYI.   When our receipt came, the line item for the dessert charge was listed as \"premium menu\" so *now* we're wondering if we could've order other things from the premium +$2 menu and been charged the $2 pp OR would it have come to $4 pp?? No one knows because they don't clearly define any of these terms up front!  It's a really frustrating experience because had the restaurant just been up front about these charges, I would be giving them a 3-4 rating for the food, which was pretty good. Shady charging schemes and inconsistent service from our server left a bad taste in my mouth and lead me to write this 1-star review. The 1-star is for their food and ambiance, plus the fact that the AYCE is made to order and not just a splay of food."}
{"text":"For the price, it is okay. It is located in a good SPF near tinge and Eglinton. Had their platter , Cantonese chow mean and pad tai. Also ordered their mango milk shake for over 4.50, you get a 8 oz of frozen ice and mango purée..definitely no milk in the milk shake.  It was disappointing.  Their noodle is a bit over salted with hint of MSG.  The pad Thai was a bit better.   For overall food value, it is average.  For service, it was very good, the server was attentive and experienced.   It makes a good place for quick food..."}
{"text":"Disgusting experience! Please beware, for your health... I love Spring Rolls and frequent quite often the Bramalea location, this time I was in Mississauga and decided to visit that location and am outraged that I was pleasantly enjoying a great meal amongst cockroaches! DISGUSTED, the operators should be ashamed of themselves! The waitress was disgusted and panicked when we let her know, and showed the roaches crawling up the walls... She asked to sit us somewhere else and we just said we were leaving... She said she was getting the manager and he/she never showed up... Yea right like they would...should be ashamed! Never"}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Spring Rolls since I went to the location on Church St downtown, so I was excited to see they had one in Mississauga. I won't go on about the decor or the state of the washrooms, it's all about the food. I'll be honest, I'm a creature of habit. I always get the chicken chow mein, with crispy noodles. It was better then I remember and so worth the trip and the parking ticket I got in that parking lot. So heads up. Feed the meter. Hahaha we also had the 6 piece spicy salmon sushi as a starter. The salmon was fresh and spicy. Delicious. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. Sorry I didn't get your name hun, spot on service.  I'll definitely be visiting again, and again."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've frequented a Spring Rolls and I have tried their pad thai at various locations with mixed results. The presentation at the St. Lawrence market location was lovely, but the taste was pretty much the same across the board.  Pad thai was inauthentic with ketchup and vinegar over rice noodles. The noodles were overcooked, so the dish was far too wet. Peanuts were sparse and egg was non-existent. The pieces of chicken were quite large, however, and an okay portion. Looks like they also cut back on bean sprouts and tofu, which were tiny strips as opposed to decent sized cubes.  Service was quick, which gave this location an extra star."}
{"text":"We had the AYCE brunch. The food was fine; the service was horrible. The waiter was aloof, limited what we could order in each round and disappeared for 15-20 minutes at a time. We were a party of seven, but the table only had three place settings and the staff could not figure out that maybe each person would like a plate and cutlery? We had to prompt them twice to bring enough tools for us to eat. The check took 20 min to process. Despite the decent food, the entire experience was an ordeal and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is my second time here.. honestly my first visit was not that impressive. Well maybe because i did not know what to order. But i made sure not to make a mistake on my second visit.  Well, we were 2 of us for dinner and we had a soup, 2 appetizers and a full course with one desert. and guess the price of the bill ??? was 35!!! oh yea i was quite surprised too.. But i'm damn sure i was full till my throat :)"}
{"text":"fiance and I went here for dinner tonight. we did the all you can eat. the food was ok, nothing special. had to wait for a table even though there was plenty free. the waitress kept bringing less food than we were ordering which was annoying. not a place id go out of my way to eat at, there is way better all you can eat sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped by here during my search for the best thai resturant in the downtown core. There are places which serve better food in the vicinity so save yourself the trouble though you do get a decent amount of food for the price."}
{"text":"Food taste good but the portion for the price is a serious rip off. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"great food, worst customer service. waited 20 minutes to be served. food came out of order. somehow the mains came before the apps and they didnt see this as an issue. sushi rolls took over 45 minutes and they stated its because \"were busy tonight\" thats not seen as acceptable when you are running a business. either you dont take tables or you serve people in a timely manner. disappointment and will probably not return."}
{"text":"This location is disappointing. I've been to a few Spring Rolls before, so this one was a bit of a surprise, but not so much in a good way. I went there with my friend for weekend brunch (all you can eat.)   My main criticism is the portions of the dishes are too large. You just can't get a good sampling of the various foods they have there when the salad alone fills your stomach up halfway. Compared to other Spring Rolls, which serve taster-sized AYCE dishes, this one is a lot bigger in their portions.  The food quality was also lacking. It did not have the same level of taste that I enjoy at other locations. The \"pizzas\" were bad - the fried rice \"crusts\" were cold and almost a bit soggy, which leads me to believe that they were cooked a while ago and left to sit. Something about the meal also left my stomach feeling not so well afterwards. Wasn't married to the toilet or anything, but definitely something about the food didn't sit well.  Overall, I don't recommend coming to this location. It doesn't do Spring Rolls justice, and frankly was a bad dining experience. I personally had a better meal at the Queen and Spadina location."}
{"text":"Good food, poor service.  The food is good and sushi are fresh.  The hostess and wait staff seem over worked and appear unmotivated.  It feels like they are rushing you when you are ordering and they do not engage the customers at all."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls used to be my favourite restaurant but I will never go back to this location.   My friend and I went to the Mississauga location a couple of weeks ago and had the All You Can Eat lunch. I absolutely love buffets and all you can eat so I was super excited to try this out since I always loved food at Spring Rolls.  We looked over the menu to see what items we wanted to order. We started off with a few salads, soups and small dishes. Everything was going great and we decided to order the next round of food. When we received this, we noticed there was a piece of hair in the noodle dish. I was hoping it was just my hair that had simply fallen out but my hair was tied in a bun and it was nothing like my hair.  I was looking for the server but she was really busy with the lunch crowd so I quietly asked one of the servers to get the manager for us. Few minutes later, our server came back with more dishes that we ordered. There was no way I wanted to eat anything else so when the server came back to check on us, I told her that we had found a piece of hair in the noodle dish. She told us that they usually charge for food that is wasted. I was shocked. Did she really expect me to eat a dish that I had just found a piece of hair in?!  I told her that was ridiculous and that I wanted to see the manager. She came back a few minutes later (without the manager) and told me that the manager had agreed not to charge for the dish. I thanked her and advised her that I was not planning on eating the other two dishes that she had just brought out because I had lost my appetite. Then, she tells me that those dishes would have to be charged for. I asked her how she could expect me to eat food from a place where there was hair in one of the dishes. Again, I asked for the manager.  Server came back (again without the manager) and told us that we would not be charged for the extra dishes and gave us the bill. No discount, no apology from the manager, nothing.  Basically, we paid full price for two adults for half a meal that we were 100% not satisfied with.  I had emailed the restaurant advising them of my experience and suggesting that they do not deal with customer issues this way and surprise, surprise... no reply!"}
{"text":"food was okie...try the ayce there...but the sevice was bad...i didnt get what i ordered and asked him again..he seemed unhappy..and he was kinda racist.....he just talked to one guy who seemed a rich person... we waited for a long time to get another shift when we finished all we ordered, while the rich guy even didnt finish his orders and got another shift...Waitress just talked to him and he didnt talk to the other people too,..bad sevice...even had to ask for the water"}
{"text":"I had this guy serving us with a look as if I own him money. I went there to have a nice and comfort dinner, that's all I wanted.  First of all, the food was very disappointing. I ordered fried beef noodle, one can go to any fine Chinese restaurant to get something much much more better and cheaper, it tasted awful.  Secondly, the services was the worst I have been given in all my restaurant experiences in Toronto. Two times, when I was trying to get the bill, I wave my hand at a waitress, she looks at me and then looked away. That was the most disgusting service I have ever gotten.  In the end, I spent some 60 bucks to get the worst food and the worst service."}
{"text":"The food tasted average   The food took about 15minutes to come (I had the all you can eat lunch)  The decor was modern and attractive  I'm probably not going to return since The price was not very good for the kind of food I'm getting"}
{"text":"Not bad. Menu may be a little large to specialize in any particular dish(es), but good enough! Shrimp is well done, although slightly overcooked.  Best part about springrolls - they deliver! and fast! Hard to find a good delivery in mississauga, so Springrolls is my top 5... in this area."}
{"text":"Why am I giving it such a low rating?  The service was terrible.  My server did not smile the entire time and I was in a brilliant mood when I sat down.  I wasn't provided water until I asked for it.  The food was poorly prepared and the sauces were bizarre.  Ketchup and mustard with my shrimp dumplings?  I felt like I was on a factory conveyer belt when I just wanted to sit, eat and read my book.  Very poor atmosphere, the music could not be heard over the din.  I will never be returning to a Spring Roll."}
{"text":"Shockingly bad.   Salmon Teriyaki - so dry that the edges of the very thin piece of fish were crumbly/chewy.  Korean Shortribs - tasted just...old.  The dried out edge had an \"off\" taste.  Har Gow - reheated to the point that the outside just fell apart in a mushy mess.  Chicken Pad Thai - pink, gelatinous, cold, absolutely no flavour except for an odd touch of sweetness.  Chicken Satay Skewers - yellow from tumeric, no taste whatsoever.  Peanut sauce was grainy mush with a salty, bitter taste.  Zuchinni Tempura - oily, flabby and cold.  Did we complain?  No.  It was obvious the waiter did not care.  We just paid and left."}
{"text":"As a family we have been patrons since they opened. My daughter is a huge fan and has remained loyal to this franchise for 20 years. The first location we frequented was the one on Yonge Street, near Charles. We moved to this location when it opened. Since she now lives in the USA, she uses the location to host group events down in the lower level when in Toronto. We always experience great food, great service at great prices. In between visits from my daughter I find this location a good spot to meet up with friends in Toronto. Due to the fact there is lots of street parking or in the lower level in the building across the street of the grocery store makes this a good spot to meet. To me this restaurant of all in the franchise is the most consistent in the offering of their food. I have tried other locations and find the food does not always measure up."}
{"text":"The ambience at Spring Rolls is always very pretty and classy. But the taste of the Asian food is not very good.  The presentation of the food is nice and the service is fast. So, its best to go here on a date or with friends due to the ambience- but definitely not for the taste of the food. Sorry to say.  Its average.  If you're going for delicious Asian food with a nice ambience, try Spoon & Fork restaurant.  Although it is always, always busy at Spring rolls, whether you go in Toronto or Mississauga, the taste of the food here will always be pretty bland, be warned.  The dessert is decent though. And the service is good. So, maybe come for that."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of bad reviews for this place about service and food. For my experience I found the food fairly good one thing was slightly burnt. Other then that it was amazing. The server I got was very attentive and that's saying something seeing how she was working the patio plus a good chunk inside the restaurant. I was very impressed."}
{"text":"Never, ever eat at this place. The server completely screwed up my order, not once, but twice! the second time around he didn't even seem to care that I objected, and basically just walked off.  I think some people assume that this is a decent place to eat because it's a chain restaurant, but it's really awful. Anyway, proceed with caution if you do."}
{"text":"I've always just walked by at this place and should have kept it that way, but today is one of those days of my life where I made a bad decision. Take that bad decision you've done in your life at your most drunk moment and experience it again for an hour. Well maybe not that bad, but it was bad.  It was a really really cold day and my friend and I were starving, spring rolls was the closest spot and so we just decided to just walk in and give it a try. Walked in, got our table right away. 2 minutes after seating down, we've decided what we want. 15 minutes after making our decision, we then finally got our order taken by our server ( she was pretty cute, pretty and cute, the only reason I give this place A Star). I had the Pho Saigon and my friend had their Pork Chop and chicken. 30 minutes later and a long argument on why most of the hot girls or should i say ladies always are taken, our food then arrived. Plating wise it looks descent and clean for both our dishes. The broth of my Pho tasted like 80% water 15% vegetable stock 5% beef flavour 0% salt and pepper ( speaking of salt and pepper, there were no salt and pepper on the table! I would understand if the food is seasoned well, but it was not and I've just given up to even ask). For something that took a while, I would expect that it's at least tasty enough and I checked one side of their open kitchen and they weren't that many chits on board really, like maybe the most was 6 in that half hour wait. The rest were edible, but tasteless, like taking a bubble bath, without a bubble and a bath, just pointless, and no I did not take a bubble bath after. My friend was really hungry and finished his food, he'll eat anything that's at least somewhat edible when he's starving. He's pork was actually juicy inside he said, or he was just doing his random dirty jokes again that I usually don't get.   The place inside looks nice actually, good atmosphere, well decorated and yeah that's all."}
{"text":"Been there twice now. Consistent food. Service was bad the second time. kept repeating that its enough no need to order more for the all you can eat menu. the cheese dumpling is good. rest of the items are ok. Nothing spectacular in terms of returning. Average items and average quality."}
{"text":"The AYCE is a pretty good idea, I like that they serve you freshly made items in perfectly proportioned size...I really loved all the shrimp items that I tried, the fried rice was delish but the chow main was a waste of calories, I expected crispy but it came out soft and not so tasty...The only prob is that if you go with friends and want the AYCE everyone in your table has to have the AYCE too which isn't too bad because the price is decent and you'll prob be spending the same amount anyway without the variety.....I will be having brunch with my family on Family Day for the AYCE"}
{"text":"First time to this restaurant tonight. Dinner was fabulous, the ambiance lovely  and the waitress Naz was perfectly present just when we needed her. Had the all you can eat option and it was great to get to taste so many different options! The food could have been a bit more bold flavours and that's why we didn't give it a 5*.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch and dinner, especially when you want to find a place that is not too expensive around Dundas square and is not bar food! They have an AYCE or a la carte option available to choose from. Both types of menu offer Chinese, Japanese and Thai food options. I have tried everything except for Chinese food and I must say, they know what they are doing! I especially love their Japanese rolls. My two favourites are the spider roll and the unagi dragon roll (both $13.99). They also have drink specials available for each day available.  Service is great and very professional, the server formally introduces themselves and explains the menu options. Gives great recommendations as well. I would definitely recommend it for those looking for something upscale causal without breaking the piggy bank!  Hint* don't forget to check in to Yelp, you will be surprised!"}
{"text":"I thought their menu is quite exotic; there's a mixture of Thai, Chinese, Japanese. Taste isn't so bad either and prices are about right for their servings.  Service was great. I thought this place was going to be another of those Asian restaurants whose waitstaff have subpar interpersonal skills but they're very capable people who knows how to tend customers.  Will dine here again."}
{"text":"Came here couple of time with coworkers for lunch. We usually get the Ayce sushi lunch special. Sushi was not bad. Food came out fairly quickly. For the price ($16) for an Ayce sushi lunch...that actually has fish in the sushi... I thout was a great value. But other than that... I wouldn't eat the other items they have on the menu. Food seems quite wash down versions of authentic Asian dishes....i.e pad thai."}
{"text":"Well, SR is one of those restaurants where I don't mind going to meet up  with my friends to catch up over some food.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that the food  isn't too bad , price is reasonable and the ambience is hip enough to please everyone. So, if you are just looking for a place to eat and hang, SR might work for you.   I always order the Tornado rolls, House Pad Thai and one new dish each time I visit.  If you are very reserved, they have a great on-line menu to give you an idea of their food.    It can get pretty busy during lunch and dinner so make reservations for large parties."}
{"text":"The food tastes good and the restaurant is neat and provides a good ambiance.  On the downside, the food is very oily and gets harder to eat after the first course."}
{"text":"Service is very slow on a Sunday evening, there are many empty tables around and within 2 hours my 4 top only received 5 orders from their ayce menu.   Food runners and servers are neglectful and the food really isn't that great. Multiple orders from my table were wrong. I really expected a little more from this restaurant based on their décor but such a low rating really should speak well enough for itself.   Lesson learned, if a restaurant has big TVs displayed all around expect service to be poor."}
{"text":"When I used to live in Toronto, I went to Spring Rolls to satisfy my Thai needs.  After moving to Brooklyn, every Thai place I eat at, I compare to Spring Rolls.  I have been to countless Thai places in NYC, but only less than a handful live up to my Spring Rolls from Toronto expectations! The pad thai is amazing at Spring Rolls.  They also have a dim sum (I think) on the weekends that is fairly cheap, especially for the amount you can get and the quality.  The waiters are always friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming.  I can't wait to go back to Toronto to have some Spring Rolls!!"}
{"text":"Had the all you can eat lunch. The food was fresh and yummy and the service was fantastic. They have ample seating on the main floor and upstairs as well."}
{"text":"Not worth your money. Go to the food court in Eaton centre instead.   Went here with a friend after a day of shopping nearby. We waited for 20 minutes for a table, order some spring rolls and pad Thai and let me tell you it's taste like ..... the worst Thai/Vietnamese food I have ever tasted.   Wonder why they are always busy?"}
{"text":"This place does not serve authentic thai dishes.  They have been somewhat modified.  For instance, their pad thai dishes offer a weird red sauce in it.  It looks weird and it tastes weird!  It is not ketchup, but something that they have created.  I would advise them to stop using it!"}
{"text":"I think Spring rolls is just as confused as I am about their identity.  Is this place a Chinese restaurant, thai, japanese, vietnamese??  I don't even think they know anymore."}
{"text":"I was here on a Tuesday for all can eat sushi and I had the worst experience and service ever!  We sat there from 7:15 to 11:00pm! This is how long the service was and how long it took them to bring our food to us.   I made reservations for 7pm for 4 people, and the last person arrived at 7:15pm. I had to wait 15 mins to catch our waiter's attention. When he took our order, he gave us a speech on \"please do not waste food or you will be charged for each item.\" No greeting or apologies for ignoring us for the first 15 mins. When I asked him how big the steak was on the premium menu he said \"everybody gets charged $3.\" I replied and said \"ok, that is fine.\" Then he reminds me again \"so each person is $3 and it is a one time charge.\" I got it the first time and it is clearly written on the menu.    By this time we were thirsty for water too and we had asked him for water. Twenty minutes passed by and no water. I got fed up and my friend got up to go get the jug of water. The owner saw and insisted it on pouring but the manager came along and poured for us. Finally our first round of food came, and we were still missing a few items. So we decided to order the second round first. We waited 30 minutes and no food came. When I saw our waiter bring the same things we ordered to another table, I was really angry, because when some of those items didn't belong that table; he realized it was ours.  I was so upset, I asked why none of our food came but the other table did when they put their order in a minute before us. He saw how angry I was and decided to kneel at table level, and tell me \"look, this is not fine dining, the kitchen is very busy and the group of people makes a big batch before sending it out. They take some time.\" In my head I was thinking, if they make batches, why isn't our food coming along considering it is the bus boy or girl who brings out the food?! I wanted to argue at this point but my friend  told me not to bother arguing. I was absolutely livid. I have never ever been treated with such disrespect. Our group wasn't rude or demanding. The food slowly trickled out and we proceeded to order our third round. Some of the items from the first round still didn't come out. I had to write our fourth order on a tissue paper and hand it to the manager. I actually can't believe the manager didn't do anything about it when I told him the waiter took our order 3 times and still nothing came out. The manager passed the tissue paper order to our waiter.   Not once did our waiter personally bring out our food. All the tables around us, I saw our server and the manager personally bring out food to other tables. All of those tables finished and left before we were even done.   When things started to slow down, then our waiter decides to pay attention to us and tries to start random conversations asking where we were from and talking about beer sorbet. I personally did not want to talk to him at all. Why bothering trying when the night has gone by so bad?? By this time, none of us were really hungry because we waited so long but it's not really fair considering we added $3 for the premium menu. We decided to stay until all the food we wanted were ordered and delivered before we left.   Throughout this whole ordeal, water was always short. I just don't understand why he was so slow. All we wanted was our food and to leave. At the end when we pay our bill and left did he say \"I am very sorry for the service and thank you.\" I would have appreciated a \"sorry\" the first time I spoke up. He was lucky we were so nice and decided to tip him 10% too!  I personally will never come here or spring rolls in general. You can get better service and quality of food at other all you can eat sushi places. At least they are fast and taste great! Springrolls is nothing spectacular and if you can't handle all you can, don't venture into it."}
{"text":"Last Saturday, my girlfriends and I decided to have lunch at Spring Rolls after we had finished with our morning spa session at the Elmwood Spa since the spa is located close by.   I had been to the Spring Rolls chain restaurants numerous times (Yonge Street, Front Street, and Sheppard/Yonge) and the food and the experience has always been great. I actually have been to this Eaton Centre location previously two summers ago and recall that the food and service at that time had been good. So to my great detriment, I actually entered the restaurant with my girlfriends with high expectations (why wouldn't I? Its a chain isn't it? Aren't chains supposed to be consistent?). I realise that I had set myself up for a huge disappointment. Here is why....   The moment we got there we were seated right away. As we sat down, we only had Dim Sum menus so we had to ask for the regular menu. Then the waiter came by to ask us if we wanted any drinks. My girlfriends replied no and before I could also reply, the waiter had left to tend to another table next to us. So after he was done talking at the other table and turned around, I got his attention and asked him if i could get hot water with lemon because i had a sore throat.   So our waters came and the waiter had brought me hot water in the smallest coffee mug that I have ever seen in my life. Who does he think i am? A child age 5? There was also no lemon. Moving on....so our food came - we ordered beef pad Thai and the beef tasted off...like it had gone bad but they cooked it anyway. Strike no. 1 Our Chinese vegetable dish came too and that dish tasted fine. So we waited and waited but our green curry chicken rice dish did not show up. We had waited over an hour and the dish had not yet appeared. Could the kitchen have forgotten about our order? To hold us over we ordered two dim sum dishes. One of the dished - the shrimp dumplings was ok but the lotus leaf sticky rice was not only just luke warm, but the lotus leaf was dry as hay. We were suspicious as to how the lotus leaf could be dry if they had to steam the dish. Apparently the dish did not look fresh so we told them to take it back. So strike no. 2.   Then my girlfriend ordered a hot water from a different waiter and the waiter brought her this large Japanese teacup wrapped in a napkin with two lemons from the side. I was baffled and wondered why our own designated waiter had brought me the small mug which was half the size of the tea cup and no lemons. As i looked around at other tables i also noticed other patrons with the same large Japanese tea cup with hot water and lemons on the side. I was really under impressed with our waiter.   Then finally our green curry rice dish came out but the dish was luke warm and looked as though it had been sitting out for a long time. So we told one of the other waiters about this and the manager came to our table. We told him that our Beef was off in the pad Thai dish and that the lotus leaf dim sum dish was dry as hay, and that the curry rice dish looked like it had been sitting around for a long time. So the manager suggested that they remake the beef pad Thai and we just said no thanks. Then he said he would not charge us for that dish.   He took the chicken curry dish back to the kitchen and said he would ask them to make us a new one. So they come back with the same chicken dish a few minutes later (still lukewarm) but it looked like someone had just thrown the dish back into a wok and reheated it. So we ate it and nothing about the dish tasted fresh. The tofu tasted old, the vegetables were overcooked, and there was no flavor other than spiciness. I had this dish previously many times but it never tasted this bad before. Strike no. 3.  While we waited for our bill to come, we saw people sitting two tables down from us with food that arrived at their table with steam that was coming out of it.  Not sure why their food looked hot as though it had just been prepared and everything we were served was not only not steaming, but looked like it had been sitting on the counter for over an hour (which incidentally is how long we had waited for our dish rice dish).   So, we paid for our food and left but by the end we couldn't order anything else there because we had all lost our appetite. The idea of eating anything else that was not fresh and potentially past expiry was more than what our minds could handle, nevermind our stomachs.   I was actually shocked that the food and the overall experience was so bad. Although the decor is nice, the service (maybe just our waiter) and the food was horrible. I do not recommend this location.   When you walk out of a restaurant wondering if you might be sick later in the day, its just not a good feeling.  Luckily, none of us got sick.  Eitherway, I still think I'd rather eat anywhere else but there because after 3 strikes, you are OUT."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Five of us went for dinner before theatre. All of us sick the next day. After two calls to management before response, I was informed that because we didn't require a hospital visit and said no other patrons had complained we were basically out of luck. Very bad customer service"}
{"text":"The best Chinese buffet in the GTA (at a price)  Spring Rolls is the best and most expensive Chinese buffet in the GTA. Unlike other buffets the food is all made to order, so you never have to worry about the food sitting out or not being restocked. This particular location is small and noisy - go elsewhere if you want nice atmosphere.   The food itself is pretty darn good as far as Canadianized asian food goes. The menu has loads of appetizers so you can get lots of deep fried shrimp served on fancy plates with fancy sauces, calamari, spring rolls (har har) and so on - stuff that normally is quite expensive. The entrees are quite good as well but fairly standard (various mixes of meat, noodles & sauces), and the AYCE also includes a fairly large sushi menu. The sushi is medicore but the kitchen dishes are so good and they really do taste high quality - much better than what you'd get at a normal buffet.   You can unlock their premium menu for $3 more than the standard buffet price. I'd strongly recommend this - if you're spending $25 on a buffet you might as well spend 10% more to get the best items possible. The premium menu includes lobster, steak & salmon dishes, desserts and coffee."}
{"text":"Horrible service, food is just as bad. Waitress forced me to tip.. I had no intention to tip such bad service."}
{"text":"The indoor area is great. The food is delicious and the service was good. A must if you are visiting Canada!"}
{"text":"I have been to several AYCE sushi/Asian food restaurants in downtown, and I am definitely not coming back. Sashimi slices were only limited to 10 pcs each time. Some foods were actually cold, and food quality consistently worsened as time went by. Servers were disoriented, and weren't paying attention to our orders and frequently left in the middle. Some ordered foods weren't served at all. In comparison to other similar AYCE restaurants and for a similar price, terribly bad quality. Would definitely not go there on weekends especially given how they were slow."}
{"text":"Just a word of warning: went to two locations and they both closed (Front St and Eglinton Ave). Sorry, never got to try their food yet. With so many closed locations (There are others I heard), it isn't exactly a vote of confidence!"}
{"text":"We had really bad service from the get go. The server first said that we werent allowed to bring a bottle of wine. Had to speak to the manager and they did allow it but the server wasnt aware. Charged a corking fee of $10.  We took fried calamari and dumplings as starter. They were both good. For the main meal, we had green curry seafood. It was the worst green curry i've ever had. The seafood had no flavor at all. It was as if it was just boiled in water and the curry sauce was added on top. The mussels were disgusting as well.   overall.... a big disappointment!!"}
{"text":"For lunch ok and defiantly a step up from the really bad food court."}
{"text":"One of the best combo of food quality, value and ambient.  - all the locals knew it."}
{"text":"great patio in the summer! the food is decently priced, fast service."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE with one of my girlfriends. We were seated immediately which was great! the menu was huge and there were variety of different dishes you can choose from. We ordered a lot!   Here's the list of what we ordered and our thoughts:  Mango salad - amazing! We ended up ordering another.  Seaweed salad - was a little too salty for our taste.  HarGow - the shrimp was good but the dumpling skin was a little too thick for our liking.  California roll, Dynamite roll, Spider roll, Red Dragon roll and Salmon Sashimi - good quality, nice presentation.  Coconut shrimp - loved it! We ordered 3 more orders of this. :)  Cashew chicken - way too much sauce. Not enough chicken.  Garlic Back Choy - mediocre at best. Had some gelatinous lumps in it.   Ginger Broccoli with beef - had no taste to it.   Beef with Squash - tasted awful. We asked the table beside us to taste it as well. They said the same.   Mango/Matcha creme brulé - BEST dessert ever! A must try!   Needless to say, the food was meh. However, the service was AMAZING! Our server was hilarious. She was straight forward and gave us her honest opinions on some things that we wanted to try. She had a memory like no other. Loved her! Would go again just to be seated in her section!"}
{"text":"I don't normally feel the need to write a review after I've been somewhere (good or bad service), but I felt the need to say something now.  This was my first time at this Spring Rolls and I doubt I'll be going back.  I went with my office, probably around 15 people.  When we arrived we were the first ones at the restaurant, but we continuously were served after people who showed up at a later time.  I don't think we actually got our food until an hour after we got there.    The food itself was fine.  I ordered the hot and sour soup and lettuce leaf wrap appetizer.  I was impressed by the size of the soup.  It was a large helping, and I was expecting a much smaller bowl.  When I got my lettuce wraps, there was a bug or dirt on the first 2 leaves of lettuce!  The lettuce also looked wilted and there were some brown spots on the corner.  Basically if I found it in my own fridge, it would be OK, but definitely not acceptable for a restaurant.  The underside of my plate also felt grimy as if it hadn't been well cleaned.  The edges also had that same feeling, which made me wonder what the plate was like underneath my food!  To top it all off, one of my coworkers didn't even get their food!  it was missed when entering.  Normally I can understand, but the restaurant was only a quarter full.  We definitely got the impression that they would rather dissappoint 1 group than a few smaller tables.  Granted it was our waiter's first week or so and we were his first large group, but there  was no help from any other staff or even the manager.  Quite disappointing.  Even though I hear that the other locations are fine, I doubt I will be eating at this or any Spring Rolls in the future."}
{"text":"The food is kinda polite ,but the service is definitely average.Well,i am a foodie,doesn't mean I eat everything.Not bad food,good environment .Recommend not to get sashimis .appetizers and Thai food are adorable."}
{"text":"Half the items we wanted were not available which sux when you are paying 30+ for dinner all you can eat. the cooked food was awful. The best part of the meal was the sashimi. the all you can eat menu sounds awesome but it was really lacking. not worth it. also no air con and even though our waitress was friendly no one seated us we kinda wondered around to get a table...."}
{"text":"Oh I love love love Spring rolls!  They have the best veggie spring rolls I've had in a long time.  I usually go with co-workers for the all you can eat at lunch - very fair price, and the wait staff is friendly and doesn't disappear after a few rounds of all you can eat that I sometimes notice at other places - they do tell you at the beginning that if you waste any food you could be charged. And I think thats fair - but we never waste food so never an issue.  All you can eat has a lot of items on it - you can get a few more items(steak, and more pricey sushi) for a few dollars more - if you are in a group and even if only one person wants the higher priced all you can eat, the whole table will be charged for the more expensive one(for obvious reasons)  I'm a vegetarian, so I always get the veggie type sushi rolls, which are always super good. My co-workers however always get sushi, sashimi, and maki rolls, and have always really enjoyed it.  Wait staff is friendly, and restaurant is comfortable and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"5.99 for a giant bowl of noodle soup that takes me 2 sittings to eat, what more can I say?  The broth was good (a bit salty, but flavourful) and the noodles were nice and crispy. There was lots of chicken and shrimp and mushrooms, and it was ready in under 5 minutes.  It's definitely food court/fast food style, but if that's what you're in the mood for it's a fast, convenient option."}
{"text":"Went to Spring Rolls the other day and it was DISGUSTING. We had the all you can eat dinner menu. The food was bland, the service was less than mediocre, and needless to say, I'll NEVER be going back again"}
{"text":"We order from them at least once or twice a month. The food is always fresh and tasty. The delivery driver is always kind and remembers us and greets us with a welcome attitude. Even with delivery service the food is always presentable and hot. we usually order in because there are so many good items on the menu and we like to pick at them and even eat the left overs the next day. I always order the famous pad Thai, mango chicken and shrimp, and the unagi roll. Before being introduced to srpring rolls I wasn't a big fan of thai food or sushi and now I crave it. We ordered the spring roll platter and it was small and the spring rolls were greasy. I am glad we ordered other stuff, because if I was to base our experience on just the spring rolls we probably wouldn't order again. Over all we really like the food. the only thing to watch out for is there online pricing was slightly different from what we were charged it really was much but when I asked the phone operator she mentioned that there pricing has changed and there was nothing that she could do? I think that was bad customer service and that she should of done something or offered to toss something in. Overall Spring Rolls product and packaging is our favorite Thai delivery service. I would recommend anyone to give them  a try!!!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Wed and ordered from their lunch menu. I had the crispy cashew chicken but chicken was not crispy at all and overall flavour of dish was very blah. I was expecting at least some spice/heat but beside the one lone chili pepper I found, there was nothing. Food came warm but certainly not hot. Not a great experience and with so many other Thai options probably won't be back"}
{"text":"Don't know exactly what is the specialty: Chinese, Thai, Japanese? The Pad Thai looks like and tastes like sweet and sour noodle. It is so terribly horrible, I had to waste it."}
{"text":"I rate this place a zero. We went for All you can eat on Valentines day.  They were very slow,didn't bring everything, items they brought we very cold and not cooked well. Items that came that we eat made us ill. Watress My daughter couldn't' move very weak. We asked if there was MSG they said no. My son was sick, and I felt very weak aswell. The waitress noticed my daughter looking ill and brought her a gingeral.  It didn't help. I had wine that I didn't finish. They charged me for the full bill and wine. I explained that we didn't eat much and the items we eat made us sick. They took 10% off and said we were lucky to get this. They opened up another location in Vaughan, rumour has it that Rita the owner is very tight on money and needs every penny she can get to help out for the outstanding debts they have. Do not recommend this place. RITA is very rude and unprofessional, aggressive. Owner Rita is totally focused on the business and has no care about the people. Becarefull they put some chemical in the food that makes you sick and blotted. Well be reporting them to the health department. Shame on you Rita, making my children under 12 sick and having no are and taking our money."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time on Saturday. Food wasn't that good for an AYCE restaurant. (Although I have been to one other place that was worse). I give this restaurant and this specific location a 2 stars because the food wasn't that great but our waitress was nice.   We were seated right away. The atmosphere was nice and warm. It was pretty busy for dinner. Arrived there 6:45pm.   Our first appetizer took 10 minutes which was one order of miso soup and wonton soup. My wonton soup was warm but my husbands miso soup was cold!   seaweed salad and mango salad came after a few minutes. When biting into the seaweed salad it was harder than I'm used to. Taste was ok. The mango salad was amazing. One of the two items on the menu that we tried and actually enjoyed.   Then we got our sushi roll order: rice was way too wet than usual.  Spicy salmon roll- tasted ok but I've had better Vegetable explosion roll- ok Fire kamakachi roll - ok   Sui Mai was ok as well   Salmon and tuna sashimi was room temperature and texture was off. (Used to eating it cool temp)   Then the coconut shrimp came. We ordered 2 pieces. One was cold and the other was warm!   (Everything came slow. There was always a pause between entries. One or two  plates would come at a time and we would be finished and had to wait at least 5 minutes after for the next entry. Mind you the portion are 'taste' sizes so it didn't take long for two people to finish one entry.  Usually AYCE restaurants will quickly bring your food. )  Also the cheese dumpling was good. (The other only item that we actually liked).   Then came the tempura basket. The vegetable tempura was ok. The shrimp tempura was ok too but we've had better.   For the main course, we ordered a chicken fried rice. The rice was wet like the sushi rolls. Taste was ok but we didn't finish it.   Pad Thai was like eating spaghetti. Too much sauce. Taste wasn't what I'm used to.   The sizzling Korean Kalbi was warm and taste was ok.   Stir fried seafood wasn't great. Broccoli was hard! Only ate the shrimp and bachoy.   Last, the grilled New York AAA Sirloin stake was ok. Cooked medium well. Not as much flavour as you would get at a steakhouse but it was ok for an AYCE restaurant.   I've read some reviews that they no longer carry dessert on the AYCE menu. But this location did. The desert , we had the mini bites. The brownies we actually nice and moisture. Tasted good.  The mango crème brûlée didn't taste like mango. It tasted like a regular crème brûlée.  The mango tango mousse and the coffee flavour mousse was ok as well. We were expecting it to come in a bigger glass but  it came in shot glass size but made sense cause it's an all you can 'taste' menu and you could order more if you'd like.    In conclusion , there were a couple of items that we enjoyed. But since we have been to better places that offer the same food but taste better, we would not choose to come back to this establishment."}
{"text":"I have been in Spring Rolls in several locations. We had a big get together with our college group. We were dining on the second floor. Food was pretty nice but they lost stars on the service. Overall we didn't feel welcome. Had to wait for too long. And at the end when it was almost time to close they started turning the light on and swiping the floor. That was very awkward. Don't thing this is my place to go again."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE lunch on the weekday. It's pretty worth it as far as downtown places go. $16++.  Food: They serve an assortment of Asian food - dim sum, sushi, Thai dishes (curries, pad thai etc), Malaysian fried rice. Overall the food was disappointing. Sushi was not fresh and they are stingy with the \"topping\" on your sushi.  Dim sum was only ok. Wonton soup was disappointing. The Thai curries were too watery. Tom yum tasted nothing like tom yum. Spicy eggplant was good though. The most enjoyable dish overall was the Malaysian fried rice, interestingly enough.   Ambience: Nice ambience but I was seated next to some water feature that looked a little gross. It looked like there was algae or something growing at the bottom of it. Other than that, everything else was fine.  Service: Not attentive and a bit slow. I ordered the calamari and had to remind the server TWICE that it still hadn't come yet. You have to constantly look out for your server. Other servers do not bother helping.   Overall: Would I come here again? If I'm really hungry and have time to spare, I might give this another shot. Now I know which dishes to avoid, I can try a few other options I didn't get to try. But don't come in with high expectations."}
{"text":"My friend recommended this place to us and it was a great Asian fusion type of restaurant.  The rolls were a bit heavy on $ (10), but they were large and delicious.  The noodle dishes were large, but why was the pad thai pink (-1 star)?  Is this a Canadian thing?  Mango Mojitos for happy hour were also choice.  Benjamin who was the manager? was very entertaining.  Make sure to return some lip if he dishes some out!"}
{"text":"Rating: 2.5  I sometimes go for lunch there out of convenience.  My usually: noodle soup + chicken mango  salad. They are not bad.  Sushi combos: hit or miss. Might be fresh or might not be. Not worth the risk.  Pad thai ..... is just wrong.  Location is convenient thats the main reason for me. Servers were not super friendly but at least they were polite to me."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Spring Rolls as I recently started to travel here for work and I definitely never coming back to this restaurant again. Whatever you do don't take their all you can eat option, the food was disgusting, sushi were huge in size and mostly comprised of rice, it felt like eating cold old rice with a crab stick and some avocado. Although I ordered three different kinds, they all were essentially the same. The rest of the dishes were just as disappointing."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday for lunch with my husband. We recently moved to the area from downtown, where in downtown we used to enjoy AYCE from spring rolls on Dundas. This is so far  the worst food we ate. Everything seemed they were  just just dropped on the plate ( messy plating ), salty, Pad Thai was swimming on his sauce, and sashimi was warm. I am not sure if all spring roll changed their menu, but this is very limited and westernized. If I wanna eat bruschetta and prosciutto melon, I wouldn't have gone to spring rolls."}
{"text":"I used to hate Spring roll's because i used to order items like pad thai and red curry, but I just wasn't a fan because I've had better at other places. I started going for their all you can eat lunch specials.Their all you can eat lunch run from 11-3pm on weekdays and is only $14.99... They have it weekends too but it's a little more expensive as well they have all you can eat dinner specials. The portions are fairly small, but it allows you to try many different items on the menu without wasting... And you can keep ordering it if you like. I really liked their Malaysian fried rice and crispy avocado hand roll. Service can be slow depending on how busy it is, so I would recommend you order many items at once."}
{"text":"Went there for the all you can eat dim sum and sushi. The food was great and worth the money.  What made the experience best was our waitress. She was so attentive, friendly, and made wonderful menu suggestions.  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"its a little over priced, but im always happy with the food and the service.  i recommend the FBI ( fried banana ice cream )"}
{"text":"Feeling a bit stuffed up today, I decided to grab a Hot & Sour soup as takeout, hoping it would clear the sinuses.   Unfortunately, it was a bust.   For one, I found the whole restaurant to have an off smell when I entered.  Sort of a musty, house-full-of-cats kind of smell.  It was a turn-off.... and considering I'm stuffed up, the smell must have been pretty strong for me to smell it.  The Hot & Sour soup was so-so.  VERY thick, which is maybe a personal preference.  I also found a tiny piece of fuzz in it, which is not the biggest deal in the world, but not the nicest thing in the world.  The taste was okay, but not fantastic.  I didn't finish it by a long shot.   Luckily, I got 2 veggie spring rolls to go with it, and they satisfied me a bit.  I've never understood why Spring Rolls' spring roll sauce is so thick and sweet, and not like any other Thai/Asian restaurant I've ever been too.... but nonetheless, that was the portion of the meal that appeased me today.  Not very impressed.  Doubt if I'll ever return.  I miss the Spring Rolls of the good ol' days."}
{"text":"Don't order the mango crème brûlée. It's tiny tiny tiny. Pad Thai was too plain. Nothing special. But the salmon was good."}
{"text":"I used to like Springrolls back in the day when it was new and just entering the Toronto market.   Wow, has it ever gone downhill.  And this location seems particularly bad.   We've come to think of Springrolls as \"fast food\", because generally, it is.  And so one night in June, in need of a fairly quick dinner, we stopped in here.    However, the service was SLOW.  We were seated in a back room and neglected by our waitress, who as it was, wasn't that great.  On top of  that, they had an industrial fan blowing quite noisily, likely due to some sort of leak or flood, and so it made all of our conversations a lost cause.  There were only about 6 tables in this back room... I don't know why they wouldn't have closed it off for the night while they dried it out.    Oh!  And there were TVs in the room.   Playing sporting events... talk about bringing it down a level......  The food is mediocre.  I used to think Springrolls did decent food at a fair price.  But now it's just food at a fair price.  Despite the fact that they present it nicely, it just feels a bit like cafeteria food made in mass quantities, with no love.    I don't think I'll be returning to this location.  I wish they could improve their standards a bit, because it really used to be great."}
{"text":"The place was over rated. Good service but poor food. I found better spring rolls in a tiny shop down the street"}
{"text":"I think if you decide to eat here you've given up on getting a good meal. There aren't many options right in the area for Thai/Asian or whatever cuisine you call it when there's pad thai, dim sum, sushi and bruschetta on a menu (ideally we don't come up with a name and discourage the practice outright). Frankly the food is edible and fine, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"We have been ordering from here for years. I have never complained because we are typically satisfied.   4 days ago (monday night), we placed our usual order. Not only was it over an hour late, everything came cold and the portions were not full.  We were hungry so we ate it.   I called this week after returning from vacation and they basically told me that I waited too long to call. It's been 4 days, and I was on vacation  We tried calling Monday night at 11 after we ordered by the office was closed.  They then said they would give me a credit to spring rolls but ONLY for  the hot items we ordered. which wasn't even 50% of our order. Why on earth would we want to order from you again? Where's the refund?  Needless to say we will no longer order from here again. The amount of business we have given you over the years must exceed $1,000 at least. Not to mention the amount of catering we order for our work. Never again.   Our bill on Monday was $60. I guess business is so bad for them, they cannot afford to refund a loyal customer and return me the full amount.   As a valued (or so we thought) customer,  we should have received a full refund and then some.   Do not order here unless you want cold food, inconsistent portions, and a wait time of at least 1 hour when I live 4 blocks away and incredibly poor customer service."}
{"text":"There was once a time in my life when I frequented Spring Rolls, well, quite frequently... I am glad those days are over. I had been many years-Spring Rolls-sober when I was enticed back to try their AYCE dim sum. Not once, but TWICE. *bows head down in shame*  The first time should have been enough. I will admit that an AYCE dim sum experience is novel and exciting, but that's about it for positive adjectives. I would warn to stay away from the following: all of their soups, the rice rolls with shrimp/beef/veg (all you will get are the rice rolls, with very stingy portions of content), sticky rice, all fried rice dishes, most sushi items - especially the spicy tuna rolls, and creme brulee. Decent items are the seaweed salad, har gow (too sticky, but we're talking Spring Rolls standards here), and ice cream.  Service is mediocre at best at this location. There is a particular server that I have had the \"fortune\" of having both times, and he really does not enhance the \"dining\" experience. If you really want dim sum this coming weekend, do yourselves a favour and make a trip to Chinatown (err, or Markham, if you fancy like that).  Tip: if you still decide to come despite my wisdom, just come here early. Everything (service, food quality, portion, etc) drops to a 0.5-star after 1pm.  Atmosphere - 3/5 Service - 2/5 Food - 2/5 Price - 3/5"}
{"text":"I went to Go after seeing a sign in their window for Hong Kong-style wonton soup. If there's anything I adore, it's wonton noodle soup! While it isnt as good as King's Noodle on Spadina (but then, what is?), for $5.99 and a 5 min walk from my work, this place doesnt do too badly.  I received a healthy mess of noodles, about 6 pork-filled wontons, a generous topping of bok choi and a few slices of BBQ pork. The broth is a bit on the meh side, so be sure to add hot sauce! If there was one way to make this a 4-star review, it would be to add shrimp to the wontons.  Ill def come again (although now that Im thinking about it, I seriously need to get to Kings)"}
{"text":"worst experience of my life. Manager came and told me to learn to control my kids. they were a little hyper due to the fact we had to wait an hour for food. Will never return. Poor service and extremely rude \"manager\" boy."}
{"text":"I went there for the AYCE lunch on a weekday.  It was ok.  Price was fair for what I ate.  Pretty varied selection."}
{"text":"My favorite place for thai fusion, great green curry but ask for it in a bowl with more broth. ...  Tango Mango chicken and shrimp is also great! add sticky rice and your rolling !"}
{"text":"As far as chain restaurants go, this Spring Rolls is not bad.  I have never been to another location, so I can't speak for the brand, but I felt the food was decent enough, and reasonably prices.  Service was very friendly, and the decor was pretty awesome.  I loved the wonton soup!! I seriously gauge Chinese restaurants off of their wonton soup, which often is just plain disgusting.  Here, the broth is clean and fresh, the wonton filling is flavorful, not too much noodle, and I liked the slices of fresh bell pepper.  It had be come back a second time- I'm a fan.  Tried both the red and green Thai curries.... they were just \"meh\".  They had that problem where they were spicy, but not very flavorful, and I have had some really good Thai curries to compare to, so not a hit here.  But at least the dishes were loaded with fresh vegetables, like a whole baby bok choy, broccoli, eggplant.   I really appreciated that, being stuck in a hotel near a shopping mall where fresh food was kind of hard to come by.  Unfortunately I never did try the spring rolls... oh well.  If you find yourself somewhere there aren't many food choices, Spring Rolls is a safe bet.  But if I were in a city such as Toronto, I'm sure you could come by better Thai/Chinese at an independently owned restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been to this Spring Rolls twice. This is a smaller location, and generally not as busy as other ones. I like the decor of this one, as they had a really nice cloth wall papered wall. My Pad thai at this location had burnt pieces in it, like the pan wasn't properly cleaned? Never experienced that before. This restaurant goes into crowd pleaser category, great atmosphere and ambience, decent food/drinks and good prices."}
{"text":"This was my first downtown dining experience without my parents back in high school and I felt so \"urban\", trendy and in the know. The first time, I absolutely loved it but I did return to it a few times after and it has seriously declined over the years or maybe my taste has just matured. The food just seems to taste blander and blander every time I come here. This place is always packed, but there are so many Asian restaurants in Toronto, go outside of the box and experience the independent ones. Though I do admit, this is a very pretty restaurant with a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"As far as Spring Rolls restaurants go, this one is not my favorite, I even like the Erin Mills one better! I have tried most of the locations and this one can't seem to get their food to taste right, the pad thai is consistently flavorless, as I have ordered it about 7 times alone from this location for takeout. I do like the Shanghai noodles in terms of vegetarian food though.   This location has a really great atmosphere for a get together though. There is a separate curtained area with large circular booths. Along with tons of tables everywhere. This location reminds me most of the one by Dundas Square. Service is pretty consistent with all Spring Rolls locations, they get the job done, but it is never outstanding. Spring Rolls has a great selection of food and drinks, and it is a good place to try for people that are new to \"ethnic foods\".  Presentation is simply flawless at this restaurant for being relatively cheap. I recommend this restaurant for groups, and for atmosphere, it is generally a crowd pleaser, unless you are dining with hard core foodies.  The best Spring Rolls location is the one beside the St. Lawrence market, best atmosphere, not to big or small and their food is the best."}
{"text":"Great and friendly service! Good was fresh and yummy. I had sweet and sour chicken as well as some fried dumplings to start, both were great."}
{"text":"Springs rolls are generally the same wherever you go - they taste great, but the portions aren't known to be the hugest. Which is a downfall for me since I love to eat until i can't get up. This doesn't happen when I come here, as I contemplate Mcdonald's on the way out. But, for the majority of people, I'm sure this is a good place to eat.   What stands out the most about this place though, and you'd probably never guess it, is their bathrooms. Oh my god. It is the nicest bathroom I've ever seen in a restaurant. I wouldn't have minded eating my meal in here to be honest.  Each urinal comes with its own little television where they play music videos. It has a huge lounge feel. Obviously, I spend more time in here than I need to, shaking it more than I should, but it's worth it.   But back to the food - I usually get the Pad Thai. It is pretty good, but not the best I've ever had. I may be biased though since I'm so fond of my asian buffets. I guess I'm quantity over quality? Or I just love chicken balls and this place pretends they don't exist.  Bottom line - if you need to hit the bathroom, and aren't dying of hunger, definitely come here and check it out"}
{"text":"all you can eat sushi is good. service is bad. They have everything but everything is not perfect."}
{"text":"So disappointed .... Used to like it but now it sucks . It's cold inside. All you can eat menu is very restrictive"}
{"text":"I dont know if it's just this location but the food was horrible!!! To start the mango salad wasn't thai at all ... hello is green mango not sweet! and where are the nuts and the onions?? and the greens were all soggy and old ... then the soup it did not look like the picture in the menu and was super sweet (i asked if it suppose to be that sweet, and she answer \"yes they put lots of sugar\")  ... finally the noodles were swimming in sauce, in which i could not find the nuts  and was super salty!!! ... That would be my last time in all Spring Rolls!!!"}
{"text":"I USED to think they have good thai food years ago (I guess that time there wasn't much asian food choices back then).  I remember coming to this place last time and I found pieces of aluminium foil in my chicken pad thai; so I let the server know and they won't do anything about it. No apology from the server or manager; I told them that I don';t want the same thing happen to other customer but it fell on deaf ears.   Food quality is mediocre at best; nothing special about it.  Not an authentic restaurant at all.    WIth the boom in asian cuisine in the past 10 years, there are TONS of restaurant around the area that serves MUCH MUCH better Thai / Malaysian / Japanese food.  I wouldn't even consider eating here when I'm in the area.  I had better thai food at the First Markham's food court and it's way more authentic."}
{"text":"Came here for the brunch AYCE today. My husband and I came in with low expectation, being super hungry, yet craving dim sum in large quantities and paying a reasonable price around our area compelled us to try here.  The regular AYCE brunch is $16.99 and provides you with a nice list of a little over a dozen dim sum items to choose from, as well as some \"thai\" and \"chinese\" dishes to choose from such as wonton soup, stir fried noodles, pad thai, tom yum soup, etc that section is over 20 items, you also get a list of sushi and rolls to choose from. So overall,the concept is good if you are craving a wide range of Asian cuisine.  Foodwise, it is hit and miss:  Sushi and rolls - 1.5 stars (being generous since it is an AYCE joint), I have NEVER seen such a large rice to fish ratio, the fish was sliced so thin it was translucent and the rice was at least 1.5 inches thick, so the rice to fish ratio was like 12:1 if so much. We tried the salmon, white tuna and ebi sushi, the low quality of the fish is very apparent.  Dim sum: The dim sum was actually pretty decent definitely 3/5, it is not as good as Crown Princess or Rol San, but Rol San is darn far from my home and Crown Princess cost    more and there is a wait on weekend.  Har Gao - shrimp was clean and crunchy as it should be, but the skin was too sticky, overall still edible. Siu Mai- Pretty tasty, pretty run of the mill, nothing special though. Sticky Rice with meat - Low on meat, high on rice, and a bit mushy, but tasted alright Steamed shrimp rolls - Shrimp is clean but roll exterior is too thick and sticky, flavor is alright, I like the little garlic chips on top. Shrimp Roll (fried) - surprisingly good, crispy, nice wrapping to shrimp ratio, not greasy. Steamed chinese vegetable - greasy but edible. Red curry crab back - I didn't like it, it tasted like mushed up meat with flour but my husband did.  From the \"Thai and Noodles sections: Singapore Noodles (Shrimp) - greasy, lacks flavor but gives lots of shrimp Thai Eggplant with shrimp - Pretty tasty, eggplant and broccoli were not overcooked and fresh and the shrimps were nice but it was a bit salty, I guess with steamed rice, it would have been better since it would \"dilute\" the saltiness a bit.  Service was good, the server was nice, and checked on us sporadically even though I can tell he was a bit swamped, he was not intrusive but responsive, which is the type of service I like for a place like this.  Overall, I will probably rather go to Rol San for dim sum when the weather warms up, and if I want sushi I will probably go to Wow sushi around the corner. But if I want to binge on a large quantity of dim sum for a relatively low price, no wait, and stay in my neighborhood I will come back here."}
{"text":"I've been to Spring Rolls in several other locations and I had no complaints until I went on Saturday. First of all, how can you mess up the reservation by getting the wrong name twice when I confirmed by the phone. Once I reached there they kept telling me there is no name for table of 15. She directed me to the table to hold the dinner for 15, but as each customer came asking for the name they didn't put effort to find our table and simply said there was no name under the reservation. When the waiter, Jixi came to our table he split our table into two sections to make it easier to order. However, why did he kept forgetting our orders not once but three times. You would think reminding him each time would make him do his job properly. We complained that the food should come in at the same time but for every order one section would receive it earlier than the other. At one point, we received steak and found a strand of hair in our meal. We were so turned off we didn't care that they missed our rest of the order. It's pretty embarrassing to have a work dinner and get served the soup and tempora that was ordered as an appetizer and to only receive it during the meal entre. At the end of the night we asked for a discount for the terrible service and they were only able to deduct two dollars off the meal. My colleagues and I will never step into this restaurant again for them to not being able to take full responsibility of their lack of good service and management."}
{"text":"I had been to Spring Rolls in the past and had positive experiences.  This was my first time going since they started offering the all you can eat tasting menu.  The weekend rate for tasting menu is $26.99.  It does include dessert.  Overall, the quality of the food was a bit disappointing.  I wish I had seen the online reviews before going.  The dim sum was the best part of the meal - the siu mai was very good.    Anything that is Japanese on the menu is not anywhere comparable to what you would get at a Japanese restaurant.  If you are used to good quality rolls, it will not be the same quality here.  It seemed like the rolls were prepared in advance and sitting for someone to order it.  No complaints on the service and the décor was nice.  In my opinion, if you stay closer to the Chinese dishes, the better off you are."}
{"text":"Chose to eat here because Pickle Barrel was crazy busy. Cut through the atrium for Spring Rolls. Talked to the hostess, received rude curt answers. Claimed that it would take 15 minutes and that we should wait outside the restaurant, even though there were obviously chairs available for us to sit on and wait.   Server was nice and fairly efficient. Went back and keyed in changes to our bills without giving us attitude. The experience with the hostess really soured the experience though.  I ordered the New Zealand rack of lamb, medium rare - it was on a bed of white rice and red curry, with some broccoli and shanghai bak choi. Food arrived surprisingly quick (almost too quick - made us suspect microwave). One of my friends ordered 10 minutes after we did and the food came all at once.   It was definitely a \"meh i've had better\" experience though (I was looking across the street at Joey and wondering if hostesses would be nicer there)."}
{"text":"This place is a fairly nice location an layout. Food wasn't very exquisite nor was it tasty; they food service was horrible an the waiters took forever; it wasn't even busy an it looks like everyone working their was goofing off. We didnt even know who our actually waitress was. If you want to come here to wait an talk with your guest; best place to be."}
{"text":"Terrible food. They make their pad thai with ketchup. Have gotten food poisoning here. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Fairview Mall has upped its game with all its new stores and the recent renovations. The Spring Rolls at this location just so happens to be one of those new comers. The décor is quite impressive, for what used to be a pretty grungy area. That said, the food is well...  pretty mediocre to be honest, as it is expected of most chain restaurants.  I got the Siu Mai (Pork & Shrimp Dumplings) for $3.99, which was pretty good, and the portions were pretty big too.   Then I got the Tom Kha Kai Soup with Chives (Spicy coconut soup with chicken) for $5.99. The first few sips were delicious, it was an explosion of tastes, but after that it just got WAY too salty, and really like salty so if I say it's salty, it's REALLY salty. I couldn't finish it even if I wanted to. I tried the same dish at a fancier restaurant in Salt Lake City and had a similar experience so I'm guessing that's how the dish is normally supposed to taste, but anyway for those who don't know what to expect, that's how it was.  I've had their Famous Pad Thai with chicken before, but I prefer it with Tiger Shrimps. I also like to add all my peanuts because I feel my dish gets pretty boring without the random bites of peanuts I get here and there."}
{"text":"To get 4 food groups, med. To pricey, I ordered a salad ( fairly fresh greens ) with chicken breast  ( moist and pleasant, not a good size dinner portion ) and a tropical watermelon cottail ( fairly pleasant light alcoholic drink, but they do have other heavier variety of drinks.  My Dinner Not filling at all.      Service was attentive, decor upscale but cramped upstairs, small narrow corridor, filled with place settings per table.  ( heavy winter coats and ptrons access. Floor may be a challenge to manneuvor around to get to your table.  But really nice woodenlike floating floors.  Main floor very intimate dimly lit.  2nd floor brightly decorated neutral colours.  Washrooms are clean cramped, well maintained.  My colleague had peppercorn steak, too heavily seasoned, salad and heavier alcoholic peach/fruity drink ~ $8 ( Steak- I could smell it strongly across my table and she started to tear up and sneeze. )     Get ready for this, bill came and unbeknowngths(group of 7)  to them till I given notice and then everyone was shocked that even 15% Tips was already charged, inaddition to another double tipping space of 15% was available if nobody was aware.      Devious restaurant DOUBLE DIPPING Tipping tacktic, to always read your dining bill line by line or get RIPPED OFF BIG TIME!!! ( they claim it was for charity, \" like my ass \" that they will submit more gouging from us for charity.   If they foul enough people, they will submit themselves as charity cases when their business will fail from smarten up more aware regular patrons.  At the end of the night, ended up getting a fallafel, chicken and vegetables, filled myself at home.  Long unsatisfactory, temp. Dipping cold night at the theatre, company discreprancy with some rascist Belgiums about not tipping extra 15%. @ dinner.. They do cater to food allergy sensitivities, means freshness, custom order specific for you !!!"}
{"text":"It takes nearly an hour for the waiters to serve you! And they act weird. They will hate you if you get all you can eat. I think there's a problem between restaurant managers and waiters here. That's why they do not care about customers that much."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai, har gow and sweet & sour soups are my favs. Prices are great and staff friendly."}
{"text":"Everyone's already said everything I feel.  I just wanted to throw my vote into the 'Spring Rolls Sucks Chicken Balls' bowl."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time coming to this place. You'll regret every second of it if you do.  We (myself and my girlfriend) ordered a red dragon roll, Thai Red Curry w/beef, Spicy Thai Noodles and a Strawberry & Guava smoothie. In the first hour we sat at our tables we only received the red dragon roll and smoothie. So clearly wait time for your order at this place is an issue.  Now let's get into the quality. We only enjoyed the smoothie. The red dragon roll was nothing special but we finished it due to hunger. The main dishes, neither of us finished them. In fact we sent them back, refusing to eat them. Both main dishes were very plain, lacking any bold flavours. You could compare them to a frozen meal. My meal, with the beef. Well it was less than pleasing when it came out looking like a chopped up mess, clearly from a lesser cut that was fatty and chewy.  The decor attempts to give a modern feel with lighting and wall treatments but it comes off as a place trying too hard.  The only perk to this place is they didn't make us pay for anything. But even with that I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"I was there yesterday ( we were 8 people ) having the all you can eat, we were regular customers at the square one location till they stopped the all you can eat offer. This location was one of our worst dining experience since a long time !!! After half an hour being there/the waiter gets us the drinks/takes our appetizer order/no food is coming, the manager comes and start talking about this new rule that we are limited for 10 pieces per order and when we finish them they will start processing the next 10 !!! We were 8 people so that was 1.25 piece per person per order !!!! Of course we started laughin at him ! After another hour of not getting any food and us getting furious at the manager and ruining my weekend dining...only then he decided to get us some food !!!   WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER !!!"}
{"text":"Been to several spring rolls location and this is one is by far the worst! The food quality was in no competition to the other locations. Really poor quality. Got a green Thai curry and it lacked in the amount of sauce and vegetables. Sushi rolls were falling apart. Would not go back to that location."}
{"text":"I've had my hit and misses from my multiple visits to different Spring Roll locations. This location is not the best I've tried. The food was too oily and salty and it can get really loud at times due to the echoing from the high ceilings."}
{"text":"I went for the first time to try something new. I fell in Love with the cheese dumplings. There warm and melt right in your mouth. The staff are friendly and there service is great. I definitely need to make another visit when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Do not go! Simply, there was a rat running around the place. We didn't see it until the after we were done eating. The table next to us were not pleased either and pointed it  out to the waitress but she didn't seem to care and just said that they get inspected  and it's all \"ok\". They only gave us a discount to not say about or get alarmed.   We got spring rolls as an appetizer and they arrived right away and were cold. The entré was ok, but the sauce was heavy and a little salty compared to the other branch in downtown. Not satisfied at all and won't be going back ever, stay away."}
{"text":"This fine restaurant is located at the Atrium on Bay, I have known it since it has been open and since then the great service never relents. The food is absolutely divine. The menus are easy to read and the staff very quick to respond. I must say I have never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Spring Rolls location ever! And this is coming from a Spring Rolls fan! The food quality is not good at all, the service was super slow- we were there for well over 2 hours over lunchtime. The restaurants wasn't very clean we found. Would not recommend this location at all!"}
{"text":"We went there with our friends. It is a nice upscale restaurant. Good Ambience. Food was good. I ordered Pad Thai and two poeple in our group ordered some vegetarian options that they said tasted good. Overall it was a nice experience. Finding a parking can be tricky so arrive 10 mins early so you can park in peace."}
{"text":"So, I tried this place for the first and last time... I placed an order for a pickup, first of all, they got my order wrong, this certainly was not the combo I ordered. Second, the food was sitting out there on the bar counter when I arrived, this meant the fish was warn. I am not sure how you like to slide or dice this, but I personally don't like the taste of raw warm fish, cold is another story. And last but not least, it did not taste good at all, I mean I am not a picky eater but it has to have some flavour. I been to so many other places and this one was an absolute disappointment. If you are going there for the ambiance, it is a fairy nice looking restaurant and decor, great for a date, as long as you don't order sushi. Their other food items may be just fine, I can't talk about them since I never tried them."}
{"text":"Had the AYCE menu. When we did not get certain items we had ordered and asked our Server where they were she always replied they were out of that item. How can a Chinese food restaurant run out of Chow Mein at 630 pm or a shrimp dish? Beware of the ACYE deal."}
{"text":"The All You Can Eat menu had some good options and the service was good. The food wasn't as perfect as the time I dined on the regular menu but didn't expect much when going in for ayce. Overall it was satisfying as I was able to try out various dishes."}
{"text":"Refused service because one person in the group did not want AYCE. They simply wanted an a la carte salad.   Staff would not budge and kept insisting that its their \"policy\". Funny that all important policy is nowhere to be seen in writing anywhere including on their website.   Greedy place. Will never go back. Went up the street to another AYCE and they happily seated us and accommodated the a la carte salad request for the light eater no problem."}
{"text":"Meh. Went with a large group. 16. Service was a bit slow. Food was ok. Had the beef Pad Thai. Was OK. Wish it didn't have tofu in it, being a beef Pad Thai and all. I like Thai food. If you're down town and have some time for so-so food....give 'em a shot."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Wednesday evening. I haven't been to this location in awhile because I felt the food was mediocre.  However, a friend wanted to go there and thought I would give it another try.  I ordered a spicy tuna roll as an appetiser and curry pad thai for my main.  The spicy tuna roll was different because the tuna was minced and the spicy sauce mixed in.  I really like the sauce and it was the right amount of spiciness for me to enjoy it (I like spicy food, but not suicide hot). I wasn't too keen on the tuna being minced and would prefer a nice piece of tuna instead.  I really enjoyed the curry pad thai. It had a good amount of sauce and enjoyed the flavours that it offered. I would order this dish again.   Overall, the waitress was very friendly and polite.  The quality of service is better than most places."}
{"text":"Sangria Not very good@6.99. I went for the new $20.00 prefix. Not so sure I will be going back."}
{"text":"Every onced in a while I decide to give this place another chance and yet again it was a mistake.  Same old story:  service is that is indifferent at best, food that is no more than mediocre and pricey ($4.50 for spring rolls and $5.50 for soup).  There are two other things that bug me.  First, everything is a triumph of form over funtion: the soup bowls are wide and shallow so the soup gets cold, it is impossible to spoon out the soup and the spoon keep sliding into the bowl.  And second all of their restaurants are always noisy.  Partly this is because there are no soft services to absorb the sound but today the place was almost empty and it was still noisy because they had the sound system cranked up.  I have no idea what the music was -- all I could hear was a thumping base line.  It's a shame that this place has so much potential and is always so disappointing."}
{"text":"Our party of 5 went to this location, for the first time, on March 29 for lunch.  On arrival, we were seated quickly.  We had the 'all you can' eat option.  Our server, James, was not the most attentive.  After taking our order, he was barely around and each time we requested his attention, we were told he'd be back.  He was more concerned with attending to a large a la carte group.  The food came within a reasonable time of ordering.  The order was mainly accurate, 1 item not received, or the quantity of another item was shorted, but no big deal.  The food in general was just OK.  The salmon sushi was good - fresh.  They really love using the sweet chili sauce.   The foods are either cooked with it or it is used as a dipping sauce.  When it came to getting the bill, 15% was added to the net total after HST, to which James quickly informed us was the standard for the all-you-can -eat.  On checking the menu, it states it will be added to parties of 6 or more.  So this was a blatant lie.  He was attentive when it came to the payment though, he stood over the paying person waiting for the credit card processing.  For the price of $18.99 for lunch that was just mediocre, I will not return."}
{"text":"This is a very pretty restaurant - inside and outside. The patio is lovely and the decor on the inside is dark wood, straight lines and very chic.  I met a couple of friends for lunch and realized there's no entrance from the mall so you have to exit where Michel's Baguette & Jugo Juice are on the upper level to access the restaurant.   I know that Spring Rolls calls itself Asian-fusion food, but I've never had a hot-pink, SOUR pad thai dish before. It was revolting. I picked at it because it was $10.99 and I felt guilty about wasting so much food, but after having about half of it I felt nauseous just looking at the plate.  My friends were not impressed with their appetizers or main dishes either. We ordered the shrimp rolls to share and they were minuscule! They were served in a martini glass full of marinara sauce but you would have had to quadruple their shrimp rolls portions to make it proportional to the amount of sauce.   Service was slow - even three glasses of water took 10 minutes to arrive at our table. The best thing we had of all the thing we ordered was the fruit smoothie..."}
{"text":"Food here is mediocre to poor. We were seated at a table with dirty plates - one had dirt on it, the other was heavily chipped, scratched with black scuff marks all over it. After asking for a replacement, the server brought back a set of new plates that were once again chipped and damaged. This dissuaded us to get any appetizers ... We ordered our entres straight away, which arrived looking bland, and reheated. The food had no life in it. It seemed like it was made the day before, reheated and tossed in a wok and re-served to us. Overall poor experience, avoid the Spring Rolls chain."}
{"text":"We went for the Sunday brunch. The place was fairly empty when we arrived at 11.30 AM. They have a solid collection of brunch items. The portions are fairly small so you dont waste food. They also specify that they will charge you for excess wastage of food. Apart from that, everything we ordered was fresh and tasty. We started with the tom yum soup, ordered a bunch of appetizers - crispy tiger shrimp, tornado rolls,crab meat in thai red curry followed by some entrees and a variety of sushi served in 6 pieces each.   It was pretty reasonable at $16.99 considering the quality and the variety of food. We'll probably be back when we feel in an 'All You Can Eat' place"}
{"text":"Terrible branch. Place is filthy and I have no idea why people still go here. Service took 8 mins to get to us and then another 10 to get our drinks. We ordered the spring roll appetizer platter to be extremely disappointed. Portion size was just as bad as the flavor and the fresh rolls were only filled with lettuce with a toothpick sized shrimp roll. The mango salad for garnish was the biggest thing on the dish and was very obvious they were cutting costs. Hopefully they clean their plates and tables better and maybe turn on the AC when its hot. The main dishes we order took half an hour (salmon with mango salsa, kalbi short ribs, lamb shanks, and pad thai) The salmon was not bad however they only seem to have broccoli as the veggies to accompany it. The kalbi short ribs came with 3 day old edamame and beans and dry kimchi. Lamb shanks had barely any flavor and was very underwhelming for $15+. Took us another 20 mins just to get the bill and during that wait upon entering the dilapidated washrooms, there was dust all over the walls, urinals were filthy, and faucets and soap dispensers were broken. Guaranteed we will never step foot in that God- awful place ever again and will be boycotting all Spring Rolls branches as they have always been a less than mediocre experience."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner at this location. It's a small place but honestly some dishes are super amazing. We had the spring rolls and the bruschaetta for the starters. I thought those were pretty average.  I tried their signature Martini Springrolini I believe. Honestly it was AMAZING. It's like a frozen vodka guava Bellini sort of cocktail. I loved it. It wasn't too sweet also, so that's perfect.   I had the chicken 'mango tango' for the main course. It said its spicy but it was NOT AT ALL spicy. Loved the lightly friend chicken, veggies, mango pieces with mango sauce. I loved it. Doesn't come with rice/bread.  The service was really good too. We went on a Thursday evening. Better make a reservation before you go."}
{"text":"This place is just alright, we decided to come here because it was too cold outside and one of our friends didn't bring his jacket.  I've been here couple times prior, it's a trendy Asian fusion.  The food is just very average, don't expect authentic Chinese/Thai food here.  I believe they also have all you can sushi now, their business probably wasn't doing well so they had to come up with AYCE sushi.  If you are in the dundas and yonge, there are millions of restaurants nearby for you to try.  Unless you're looking for better environment/atmosphere, you can get better food from Thai Express in the food court at eaton center.  But if one of your parties wants fusion food and you guys want a place to sit down and have a formal lunch then this place is alright.  The other alternative to this is Salad King nearby but that place is packed and loud so it's up to the occasion."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a place with good~okay Tuna Sashimi/sushi ayce, but this place has it!  Although their black pearl roll (one with caviar) do not even have single caviar most of the time... other than that pretty good quality of ayce place (I have not had normal menu here yet)  You would assume that AYCE place will have bad side menus, but their grill menu is really good! (Always grab lamb chop here!)  for the price you pay, you will get the food that is worth it!"}
{"text":"As always the food was excellent unfortunately our server treated us like an inconvenience for being in his section.  Jeff leaned over the glass wall to take our order and deliver our food. He couldn't even come around to the front of our table.  He was clearing dishes and cutlery as fast as we put down our forks.  He never even asked if we wanted another drink OR dessert just put down the bill. Sadly we will be visiting another location"}
{"text":"Ourfirst and last visit in this restaurant. Not only the serving of the food is slow, the servers do not take accurate orders. Also, my sister found a hair in their crab n corn soup. Its disgusting! Very horrible experience"}
{"text":"I love spring rolls, however this location is one of the worst I have been to! Yes the food is great, but the wait times, EVEN WHEN ITS NOT CROWDED, is unbelievably long. Aside the wait times, the service was also so bad."}
{"text":"Overrated.  All the tourists come here.  Modern decor, clean and loud.  Okay food and fancy presentation.  A place you'd take your out of town guests."}
{"text":"Service is quick.  You have a choice from the menu on the wall or create your own from rice with vegetables, chicken, beef, noodles from pad thai, vermicelli, etc.  My only beef is that they don't give you water.  The people that sat beside us brought their own cups.  Dinner prices start at $7.95  Food court ambience."}
{"text":"Went for a walk with my wife downtown toronto sunday afternoon.  Its was nice to walk around without the headache of the crowds.  We stopped by Springroll's lunch on our way home.  I saw that they had pho on the menu and of course had to try it.  It was made alittle different.  They used a wider noodle and the beansprouts n basil is added to the soup already.  The broth though was awesome.  Anyone who has had great pho will tell you that the broth makes the dish.    Service was a little slow though. Time was ticking away on the parking meter.  Made me nervous.  It was on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Apparently, this is the newest of the Spring Rolls in the area. Although I don't live in the Toronto area, my wife and I do visit quite often to visit my brother and sis-in-law in Brampton.  I've been to the Spring Rolls at Erin Mills, and thought it to be quite nice... so I was curious about this new Spring Rolls in Bramalea. We went for dinner on a Friday evening and I was quite looking forward to it after having spent the day in the car driving from Charlotte, NC.  The food was on-par with what I've had at the other Spring Rolls - about mid-way between above average to pretty darn good.... but nothing outright amazing.  I ordered a couple different sushi rolls that were definitely A+... very nice, fresh, well presented and very tasty.  But the dish my wife ordered was more in that \"above average range\" that I would normally associate Spring Rolls with.  The decor of this Spring Rolls is VERY nice.... they've worked hard on that... perhaps too hard... because the one area they were lacking was the service.  Perhaps they should work on that.  It was with the service that our whole evening fell apart - our server basically ruined our evening and turned what normally would be a 3-4 star review into a one star review..... yes, it was THAT bad.    We were seated quickly by the hostess, but that is where the good service ended and the nightmare began. After waiting 7-8 minutes (which isn't really that long, but an eternity when waiting to order drinks) our waiter came over, introduced himself to us and let us know of the drink specials. My brother had been having a few beers with his yardwork earlier in the day, so as a result, I was driving this evening. Not wanting to get a DUI in a foreign country, I opted for tea, as did my bother and sister-in-law, and my wife had water. We were all planning on hitting the adult beverages once back at my brother's place, catching up, as we don't see each other that often.  As we placed our drink order with the waiter I thought I detected, oh wait, what was that.... just a *hint* of attitude?  What?  Disappointed none of us are going to be boozing it up and turning that $100 meal into a $200 meal eh?  This was slight, but clearly perceptible to me and was shades of the evening to come.  From there on it was just slow, crappy service all night.  Our drinks took forever to come, our food came out dis-organized (although we did get the correct dishes (which under the circumstances was good), the food-runners came to our table a couple times with other people's food - clearly our waiter cannot communicate to his runners).  With my wife's calamari and mine and my brother's sushi, he did not bring the sauce for her calamari, nor any soy sauce for the sushi. It took him several minutes to check on us to see if all was ok (obviously it was not) and close to 5 minutes to return with the appropriate items, all the while we sat and stared at our food.  All the while, NEVER once did we hear an apology from our server.....  so one can only assume this was all business as usual for him.  My advice to him would be, if you don't want to work in the service industry, don't!  Clearly he does not care about his job one bit."}
{"text":"Food was good, but our server had a major attitude problem. We asked for warm water and he took a very long time to bring it. Then when we finished our entrées, he didn't come by to clear our table. It wasn't busy either, so there was no excuse for him to ignore our table. Finally, when the dessert came, our ice cream was all melted. We called the server over and asked if he could switch it and he gave us a long explaination about a freezer downstairs and a different freezer upstairs. As a customer, I don't care if my ice cream was kept frozen in the freezer upstairs or downstairs. I just want frozen ice cream, not a bowl of sweet soup. Finally, he changed it. When it came time for the bill, he showed us attitude when we asked for the credit card machine. Overall, the food was good but the service was a huge turn off."}
{"text":"Had a party of 7, the menu said gratuities are charged for parties of 8+. Our served automatically added in her gratuity. She forgot to put in one of the orders, and blamed us for it. Also tried to charge us extra for a dish. The server (Indian lady) actually yelled at one of our guests for not moving the cutlery when she has instructed us to move the plate. TERRIBLE server, really needs to learn customer service / manners. The only reason why I gave this place one star is bc the salads we ordered were quite tasty."}
{"text":"Pouring down rain outside, we were at the Eaton Center and wanted a quick bite. My husband asks me: Red Lobster or Spring Rolls?  You don't have to ask me twice.  In fact, you don't have to ask me at all.  I'm a fan of hole in the wall places with GREAT food. This place is more like a nice place with good food; a solid 3 stars.  The Tom Yum soup was a bit salty, the sushi was fresh, service was fine.    Saw a table card that announced AYCE Dim Sum and Sushi on Sat and Sun for $16.  I have to admit, I would try it.  AYCE Dim sum and Sushi for $16?  I've died and gone to heaven!  It didn't state if there was a time limit. Won't get to try it this trip, but if I think about it, probably next time.  Bathrooms are about a continent away,  way down in back, on the lower level, so bring your passport, and don't wait 'til the last minute.  Seriously."}
{"text":"The food was filling. Lunch menu was good value for what was served. The room was large and airy, which made for a good atmosphere. The california lettice mix was excellent.   Service was also very good. Water was refilled constantly and she asked us three times whether everything was good. I highly recommend Vivian as your waitress."}
{"text":"The place is literally nutrition-free. Very bad meat (if you can call it meat). Sloppily prepared and very oily food. Save your money."}
{"text":"I went there for all you can eat and I liked it, The food is great and the service is ok I guess it depends on who you have as a waiter.  The first time I went I really enjoyed the food but the waiter was strict on the 2 hour all you can eat limit where I though it was a bit unfair since I had to move my car in chinatown to downtown  The second time was better, they offer us a table without being strict on the limit. The food came with a promptness.  If I went back will i go, and my answer will be a yes"}
{"text":"The food was OK some dishes have no taste, but the staff are quiet unhelpful once they know it is an \"all you can eat\". They hurry your order and throw it like they want to get rid of you quickly. I was with my kids for my birthday lunch. The lady who took care of our table went straight to my 11 yrs old and asked her what her age is, as I was confused why she would ask that to my daughter , m6 daufhter was equally confused  and took a few seconds to understand what she was asking by then I said she is 11. The look on tge ladys face was like I was cheating,  she spoilt my day that minute. My daughter is thin and very tall for her age she is 5.6 , I was upset with her attitude and for a tween my daughter was very embarrassed and got a yelling from me for not understanding her question. I would hate to return back to this place."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Spring Rolls (AYCE Brunch) Cuisine: Asian/Fusion Location: Dundas Square Address:  Price Range: $10~15   1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 2  Service: 2  Ambiance: 3 Overall: 2.5  Extra information:  * All you can eat brunch on Sat & Sun 11am~3pm * Soup, Salad, Sushi, Dimsum, Thai, Chinese (Curry, Noodle and Rice) and Dessert * Only Avail at some locations  I never thought I would go back to Spring Rolls, especially since my horrible experience from that exact same location? there was no way in *bleep*. But obviously I was wrong, because I was went back....again. At least I have an excuse this time around, I wanted to check out their AYCE Sushi/DimSum menu that was heavily 'advertised' by signs all around downtown plus the Spring Roll girls handing out flyers at Dundas Square.  There will be many more meals to eat...so I thought, I can have one meal that could possibly be wasted...again.  So long story short, I was back to try their AYCE Brunch on one Sunday morning (This was already way back in early December) with my family. For adults, the regular AYCE option is $16.99 per person- and this includes all the hot food including dimsum, thai and chinese dishes as well as sushi. There is also a Premium AYCE option which is $2 more for $18.99 which includes Sashimi (salmon, tako, scallop, hokkigai, tamago, red snapper and butter fish) as well as some Chef's Special options like Grilled atlantic salmon and steak.  I didn't think the Premium option was worth it so I went with the regular AYCE option.  Ordered: Seaweed Salad (XDS-A26)  * Decent size as one of the appetizers * You can't go ordering this anywhere, it tastes same everywhere  Ordered: Siu Mai (XDS1)  * 4 pieces in a order * Beef Siu Mai * Hard as a rock and no flavor * Felt like it was pre-made and then reheated  Ordered: Steamed BBQ Pork Buns (XDS-S42)  * 2 pieces in a order * Smaller sized pork buns * Bun part was too moist and very sticky * Too much bun compared to BBQ pork inside  Ordered: Korean Grilled Short Robs (XDS-S51)  * 2 pieces in a order * Good marinade throughout all the meat pieces * Meat was little too tough but probably pre-made and then reheated  Ordered: Crispy Battered Tiger Shrimps (XD552)  * 3 pieces in a order * Regular shrimp tempura served with mayo on top * Wasn't very hot when it was served just like many other items  Ordered: Tornado Rolls (XDS-SR10)  * Tiger shrimp wrapped in crispy batter * There was just too much batter for the shrimp inside * Wasn't sure if I was eating shrimp or the batter  Ordered: Lemongrass Chicken Wings (XDS-A13)  * Regular chicken wings with sweet chili sauce on top * These were surprisingly served hot * Most decent dish out of everything that was ordered  Ordered: Thai Basil Eggplant Lemongrass with Veggies (XDS-T7)  * Good vegetarian option * Came with big chunks of vegetables such as green beans, onion, broccoli and mushroom as well as eggplant * Would be good with rice but prefer veggies to be cut into smaller pieces  Ordered: Salmon Sushi (XSU11)  * Nigiris were decent, nothing special  Ordered: Spicy Salmon Roll/Dynamite Roll/Fire Kamakachi Roll/Red Dragon Roll  * I know I ordered couple different rolls, but they all looked and tasted the same * There was not one kind that stood out from the rest * Their rolls were probably the biggest disappointment * Too much avocado in all of the rolls (they should be the sidekick, not playing the main role) * Everything was a giant mush and there was no texture  * No way of knowing which roll I was eating  Ordered: Creme Brulee (XDS-95)  Ordered: Tropical Ice Cream (Mango & Green Tea) (XDS-92) Ordered: Fried Banana (XDS-93)  * Probably the best part of the meal with the fried banana  Summary: This time the service was decent but of course, food was disappointing. I am just glad that I went in this not expecting much and that's exactly what I got.  I just really wish that they would pick one, Sushi or Chinese or Thai- and then try their best at one cuisine. Because when your food is mediocre and lacks quality...yet you try to do everything at once? It ends up being a disaster just like Spring Rolls.  If you clearly don't know anything about Asian food and want anything but authentic or delicious food, go to Spring Rolls. I swear I am never going back."}
{"text":"Mixed review, service was so slow but my waitress was wonderful and sweet when she finally got to me.  I could see all the waitstaff was running from table to table short handed.  Seeing previous reviews mention this I'd bet this is not the first time they operate understaffed.  Service 2 out of 5.  Now the food, I ordered the Spicy Thai White Fish lunch special and it was fantastic.  The fish was well cooked and the spice level was perfect.  Lovely presentation in a divided platter.  The sides were seaweed, corn salad, and jasmine rice, all delicious.  To drink I had the local organic beer in a bottle.  Sorry can't recall the name.  I know organic beer sounds silly (it's the alcohol that's bad for me, duh!) it was really tasty.    This restaurant is very cool looking.  Loved the floating silver ball decor and the white 'waves' on the ceiling.    Will I return?  Unfortunately, probably not.  I was dining alone sitting there for two hours.  I didn't bring a book or a newspaper and by the time my food finally came I was dying to get outta' there.  So service fail, food yum, not a great combination."}
{"text":"All the fancy décor in the world can not deter you from that fact that food here is a lil' lacking in flavour. Just like the interior design, the style of the dishes are there but not much else. Yes, it is great that you can mould my rice into a little pyramid but I don't really care if it is dry. And that's just rice! Even I can make a mean, plain, bowl of white rice.   The red curry I ordered was nothing close to special, kind of watery from what I recall with no panache or love. The tofu was sparse. The vegetables were...cooked. All fine, just fine. The drink fared a bit better in deliciousness. $3.99 for a Springrollini or something like that.   But there was so much kafuffle at the end that it just soured the end of our night there. The waiter refused to do separate bills! For a table of 14! It was only when we asked to speak to a manager about our predicament that he magically could accommodate us. Not smooth. Why do I let friends drag me here?"}
{"text":"This is by far the worst thai food I've ever had. I ordered from here because I had a long day of traveling and this place delivered. I got the Red Curry with Tofu and Veggies and it's truly awful. Zero flavor and really just gross. I hate to waste food but I can't even eat it. I wish I just would have gone out."}
{"text":"I dropped by for a late lunch pre-dinner snack after having to make a return to a store at Fairview Mall.  (Could you believe that I had purchased two left shoes?) The Spring Rolls Go located in the food court appears to be a popular option and having a craving for that popular McAsia of food items - pad Thai -  I ordered \"the special\" with chicken to go.  Infused with coriander, a slice of lime, tofu and some lean cuts of chicken the offering filled about 1/3 of a clear topped plastic container.   For a total of $7.90 (tax included)  it was a slim offering.  Which might be just as well.  Considering that a regular serving of pad Thai can average 1400 calories, the portion was probably perfect just for me.  If you're counting on a big meal this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch with my fiancee today and we will NEVER be going back. I had an OK meal off the lunch menu (Black bean and rice) it was perfectly fine but lacked black beans, but my pour fiancees meal was disastrous. She ordered the sushi and sashimi combo for 1 ($15.99), everything was mediocre but the salmon sashimi was disgusting! It smelt terrible, looked terrible and when the waiter came over he asked if she didn't like the salmon. When she told him it was bad he said he would inform the manager, but when he came to give us the bill he asked if that was the only thing wrong and when we said yes he handed it to us and left. We figured they would have discounted the bill in some way, but apparently not. And there was never an actually apology! Perhaps if we put up a bigger stink we would have gotten better results, but we're not demanding people and figured it was common courtesy."}
{"text":"The wait staff are not good at all. They do not know the menu.  I asked what was included int he Sushi Special and the waiter said I just started ad do not know and will ask- but never did. We waited 15 minutes for beverage since a/c the waiter the coffee maker was broken and I guess they could not serve coke and wine before they coffee maker was fixed?? The food took ages to arrive .The lady who delivered the food was at best cold and did not even look at anyone.  Food was pricey and just OK. I guess that's what chain food is."}
{"text":"I was skeptical on Chinese restaurant whose waiting staff do not speak Chinese and the menu is 100% English.  It was also too well decorated for Chinese foods.  The menu has far more than Chinese foods.  It is like an Asian fusion restaurant.  Then I found the dim sum session has only 5 items.  Hmm.... What the heck.  So the two of us order all 5 of Dim Sum.  Eggplant with shrimp, fried tofu, pot stickers, deep fried pot stickers, and steamed spare ribs.  They are all modernly (a.k.a. not Chinese style) well presented and *delicious*.  The hot tea was also modern Chinese.  It focused more on the aroma than the taste. Came in a fancy pouch system that separate the loose leaves with water.  Very nice."}
{"text":"Love the decor but can`t say the same for the food. It caters more to the western market. The chinese food is not that great, overly greasy and salty.   The house pad thai (on the ketchupy side) and chicken mango salad are the only two items I enjoy. The chinese food is tolerable if it comes with enough rice to absorb the extra grease and the saltiness of the stir fry,   Chic place to hang out with friends. Not a destination place for the food."}
{"text":"Nice Asian restaurant in Dundas street. It is very popular. We were a table of 7 and each ordered different dishes. The portions were good sized and well presented. I was surprised to get a free Banana and Ice Cream desert when I logged in to Yelp. Our waiter tasks was very helpful."}
{"text":"If your Asian friend recommend that you come here, they have been white washed and do not understand the taste of true Asian food. If your friend of any other ethnicity recommend that you come here...well, just don't go.  On the plus side, the decor is nice."}
{"text":"Writing this review as I cradle my food baby, so I guess that says a little about the quality of the food. :)  My boyfriend and I started off the meal with cheesy sweet potato fries with kimchi and spicy mayo as well as the hot and sour soup. The fries were perfectly crispy and worked great with the cheese and mayo but not so much the kimchi. Usually the hot and sour soup is a little too spicy for me but this time, there was a sweetness that was pleasant. Definitely recommend both of these dishes as well as the two mains that we ordered which were the sizzling bulgogi platter and something along the lines of tiger/zebra red thai lamb ribs. Can't remember exactly but they were both exceptional.   As for drinks, he got a Corona while I ordered a Strawberry Daiquiri. They were the highlight of the experience honestly, so good.  Service was quick and helpful, but not much else to say otherwise. Overall, it was a good experience and we will definitely be back in the future. :)"}
{"text":"I was at Spring Rolls for their all-you-can-eat lunch menu.  I did not realize they had one until I was presented a menu.  For $14.99, you get to pick and choose from various asian fusion dishes from Chinese to Thai.  If you are in the mood for small plates and sampling dishes, Spring Rolls is a good option.  Unfortunately, the food does not live up to the variety; items are either bland or over salted.  Spring Rolls is attempting to broaden their menu to appeal to the masses; by doing this, they lose on quality.  It was a great venue to catch up with my friend as we had a leisurely lunch.  But I will not be back due to lacklustre food and mediocre service."}
{"text":"Did the buffet which was like 40 bucks including party gratuity and fee for wasted food I guess; came beee for a friends birthday party with a group of 11 and felt pressured to leave ASAP even whilst eating. Chicken felt disgusting to eat tbh cause it was slimy and it was just bad quality food in small portions. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Went to spring rolls after a few years and let me say that the food was absolutely terrible. The prices are less then they used to be but the place is run down and unkept. The Tom yum soup was sweet and disgusting, the spring roll platter was oily and terrible tasting. The place is called spring rolls yet their signature dish was inedible. The calamari was soggy and smelled super fishy. The sushi was flavourless and rolled so fat and sloppily that it was impossible to eat. We were there for our anniversary dinner and sadly disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to the Dundas location for dinner and order the chef's signature roll and tom yum soup. It was really delicious and presentation was beautiful. Decided to order take out for lunch and ordered the Classic Sushi Roll special 3 for $13.99. Big mistake! All the rolls looked pathetic and not as fresh as it should be. I ordered the dynamite roll, crispy salmon skin roll and spicy tuna tempura roll. The dynamite roll was the most decent one of all of them. The salmon skin looked burnt and tasted burnt. The tuna roll didn't even look like tuna...more like chicken so I didn't even bother saving it for hubby for later. Quality on their take out menu is definitely poor at best and I would not recommend doing take out at this location."}
{"text":"Their sweet and sour chicken was 3/5; a little on the bland side.  The vegetarian green curry was 2/5. Springrolls 4/5. Mango shake 4/5."}
{"text":"Good price the decor is wonderful food taste wonderful and the service is as it should be"}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE tasting menu on a Thursday.  Overall the food was good but avoid the sushi.  Service was quick and none of our orders were missed.    Would have given 4 stars but they were all out of oysters for the buck a shuck promo which we were not told about until well after we ordered our drinks (which was required for the promo).  We were there pretty early at about 715pm so it felt like a sham to entice people to buy beverages."}
{"text":"I would give this place ZERO stars if i had the choice.  I went here 3 years ago and had an experience so awful i wrote customer service and sent a nasty complaint. Based on other peoples reviews, it sounds like i'm not the only one.  To make a long story short, the waiter and my friend had a miscommunication over her order and when he brought out 2 mango salads, one with chicken and one without. when my friend politely asked to take away one of the salads the waiter was furious and even told us that it was coming out of his pay cheque. when we said we wern't paying for the salad he stormed off and never came back to our table. we asked to see the manager and no such luck. we had to get up and ask the hostess to get the manager. meanwhile our waiter just looked over at us and whispered to his co-workers about us. the manager came out the second time we asked and he kindly told us we didn't have to pay.   BUT GET THIS!!!! We obviously never left the waiter a tip and he ran outside after us!!!!!!!!!!! we we're scared for our lives as he yelled at us in the middle of the sidewalk with crazy look in his eyes. he said that \"he shouldn't get punished for our mistake.\" what an effing loser!!! we told him he was the worst server we'd ever had and bolted.  OH... and customer service offered a 10% dsicount for our troubles... i was speechless."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from the Yonge and Bloor location tonight and was very disappointed. Part of our meal was the Satay Pad Thai and the Singapore Vermicelli. Both were terrible! My wife called to complain about the food and all they said was thank you for your feedback. We were long time customers for this location but will find another Asian restaurant in our area. Do not eat here, food and quality has gone down."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  Cutlery had lipstick from someone on it. Ew.  Had to send it back."}
{"text":"Super Duper Less than Average!  I'm working on a new project in Toronto, took the train in and wanted to grab a quick dinner near my hotel. Walking around the hotel I found this place.  They simply have way too many items to select from on their novel of a menu. It makes it tough to order and when I did it just wasn't good. I ordered 3 things 2 were very average at their very best and the 3rd should be a felony charge. If I were more limber I'd kick myself in the @@@ for coming here.  The service was fine. She was very pleasant and very quick.   This aside. I ordered: Wonton with in house dumplings $5.95. The broth was reasonable salty, sweet, with a hint of dish soap we all know and love. The dumplings! I don't really know how to write how boring, bland, and simply not good they were. I'd say a baby's diaper but I've never eaten one but it has to be close.  Spring rolls with Chicken $4.95 (I think) Parts were crispy and fine but the bulk was a big ball of greasy soggy suck with a lovely dipping sauce.  Eel Dragon Roll $9.95 (I think)  It really pisses me off when restaurants use old rice to make rolls. Its the easiest and cheapest part that should be done right each and every time. and is usually noticed when taking the first bite.  The rice was at the stage where you can't make out it is rice anymore.  I ate very little of this garbage roll. I expected much more from Toronto.  YES YOU TORONTO!!!! I expect more because I have so much better so many times.  On a positive the beer was cold.  God Awful Food with nice decore!"}
{"text":"cute place with nice decor. they have fresh flowers everywhere encased in clear, vast vases. their food was just okay, not the best asian fusion that i've eaten, but the decor, ambiance and service make up for that i guess. their drinks were pretty weak but really tasty. they try, i'll give them that much."}
{"text":"I use to come to springrolls restaurants a lot during undergrad, but haven't been here recently till last week.   The menu has a multitude of options and many vegetarian dishes as well. I had the all you can eat buffet with my friends, and that menu had many excellent choices.   The food was good, some dishes were just average like the pad Thai, fried rice calamari and sushi. Other items like the lamb chops, ribs, tempura, dumplings and shrimp were really good.   My friends and I didn't over order and I can say we actually ate 90% of the things we ordered, however our server still told us we sent too many unfinished food back and would be charged an additional fee but since this is our \"first time\" he would let it go. Well this wasn't my \"first time\" and in fact all the servers always relay this message every time we have the all you can eat. We paid like $24-28 per person not including tax or tips, and I think it would be nice that they don't constantly remind us that they would have charged us extra but didn't. And we don't waste food, some the dishes came with garnish that we obviously don't eat so I'm not sure if that counts as \"wasting food\".   Anyways, I wouldn't come back here again well not to this location at least. Not impressed with the customer service, even though I like the menu. I would much rather eat at a place with better customer service."}
{"text":"As you can tell, I only come here with coworkers - basically when I have no other option. While service was pretty fast for a large group, I felt the food has gone down hill from A-OK. I won't be back if I can help it."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such bad reviews, but I quite enjoyed my visit here.  My friend was craving Asian food and the huge sign advertising Dim Sum AND Sushi Buffet proved too good to resist. We got seated very quickly and it took a while to get a waiter. After he arrived though, he was friendly and attentive, explaining the options about buffet vs not very clearly.  We all went for the dinner buffet without the upgrade and started with the nigiri combo and some rolls. I was pretty impressed at how fresh the fish tasted and the portion sizes for a buffet. They did scale down the size of the nigiris but also the amount of rice it came with which is great cuz we had room to try other things. The roll with soft shell crab was breaded just right. We got a few of their \"pizzas\" but did not find those to be worth because there is way too much sauce and rice for the amount of fish they give. We also ordered the ginger scallops which were lightly ginger flavored and fresh.  As far as bang for the buck, my faves were the sashimi selection and nigiris. We tried some other dim sum selections that were pretty good as well but quite filling.   I'd definitely recommend this place for sushi buffet. They don't overdo it with the rice, and they offer a ton of sashimi options. 4 stars!"}
{"text":"The worst restaurant I've ever been to. Before I came here, I've already seen the negative reviews on Yelp. But I still want to give it a try. However, I wish I didn't have that thought. The food quality is low. We ordered all you can eat. But when we order miso soup, brûlée, ice cream and so on. They said they don't have it. The dishes are disgusting, so I want to eat some dessert, just to be not hungry. The main reason  We are here is for the sushi and sashimi. But they told us that the sushi is very slow? What? That's why we are here for the Valentine's Day. So we only got a little bit low quality sushi. The meat we ordered like lamb and beef is cold. And the service is very slow. The restaurant was better 3 years ago. But now, honestly?I have to say. Don't choose the Ayce and don't come to this place!"}
{"text":"The service here is always amazing. The sushi, cooked items and drinks are excellent! Never had a bad experience dining here with guests. It cost approximately $40 per person for ayce and cocktails.  First of all, their menu is huge when it comes to what you can order for your ayce experience. You get fresh sashimi and large portions of maki rolls! They offer steak, kimchi fries, grilled chicken skewers and best cheese wontons! Those items are not available in other sushi restaurants or ever cooked as well as springrolls.  The ambiance is great. The inside is spacious and well renovated. Me and my guests always get seated at a large comfy booth while we enjoy our sushi and cocktails.   Their portions are very large when for ayce. You get big pieces of sushi when you order different types of maki and special rolls. You will be stuffed for sure.  The only issue I have is their dessert menu. There's nothing special on there except the usual mango, vanilla, red bean and green tea ice cream. Their deep friend banana is not very good. Also, once we ordered grape Popsicles ( which was just a frozen grape on a wood stick ). It was pretty awful.  Overall, the food and service is fast and excellent. The servers working there are always friendly and comes to your table regularly without you flagging them down."}
{"text":"The interial design of the place is gorgeous! I lover it. I like the Food presentation more than the food taste. I had bad experience with the mango salad. It was really un-eatable, as the mango used is sour! I came thur (March.17th.2016), I was sitting next to the fountain. I was served by a waiter who is white, hair pulled back, his name if am not mistaken David.  Waiters of this resturant have to know that they are not working for the tip, yet they're working for the resturant. They represent the management and the service of this place. If they dont like th tip or we didnt tip them, they shouldnt change from SUPER nice to unsmily and aggressive!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is horrible and looks disgusting. And the service here is very \"efficient\". ??"}
{"text":"So bad it's good! Naw, it's just bad. I actually remember coming here voluntarily a few years ago, so either the food's gone downhill or I got pickier. Based on the other reviews though, I feel confident in saying STAY AWAY.  I had pad thai there, thinking it's pretty simple and a place that's \"Thai\" has at least gotta have their pad thai down pat right? Even if it's not \"authentic\". Nope, I got a chunk of noodles that were all stuck together, like when you stab your two chopsticks in the noodles, you can pick up the entire thing.  I wasn't expecting much but I was at least hoping for something slightly better than Thai Express...forget it, I'll just get Thai Express the next time I want mediocre noodles, because at least you can eat it properly.  Their lunch take-out is a nice concept, but getting your food requires an extremely long wait... don't actually go there if you think you're getting a quick take-out lunch, you're waiting just as long as a sit-down meal. Actually, the huge crowd of people waiting for their food should've been a dead giveaway.   The beef bento box didn't have the nice slices of soft beef with teriyaki on top. Instead you get badly cut chunks of beef that have no place in a bento box, or anywhere else. It's like those terrible beef bits you get when you order beef + broccoli from a Chinese place, but worse. However, another friend got the salmon bento box and it looked way better (like a salmon teriyaki piece from other typical Japanese-y places pretty much) and it apparently tasted good. Pay the extra $1 or whatever if you must get the bento box - the rest of the box was actually good and the portions decent."}
{"text":"I haven't tried their sushi to often but I'm a big fan of their Chicken Bento Box. YES! My review is just for the bento box! I love it. It is my go-to spot if I'm craving tempura, some sushi and some teriyaki. They have a take-out corner and I never have to wait for more than 15mins. It's the right quantity too, not too much and not too less. Their tempura is good but its their teriyaki that I prefer to other similar priced take out places.   Overall, if you are trying the bento box for the first time, try this place. Its also very reasonably priced. Their bento box is better than the spring sushi box."}
{"text":"I have a fear of chained restaurants, and if don't have go, I won't.  I finally gave in to my friend Tia, and decided to give this place a chance. Having been to one other Spring Rolls location in the past, my findings were; the place can cook just about anything to a tolerable degree, except for spring rolls.  The most casual Chinese appetizer, and some guy decides to open up a business based on its popularity. The idea is interesting, but whoever these chefs are in the kitchen, clearly has never been to China and had a real Spring Roll. It's like someone going to China, and open a Pizza Hut as an high-end restaurant. Oh wait, that happened. (In China, Pizza is served on fine china, in an upscale establishment, and enjoyed using a knife & fork)   The food is alright, just the spring rolls..they are deplorable. I make on an average 200 spring rolls every holiday season, my standards are high. With that said, the restaurant itself isn't that bad. The service is slow, regardless of the restaurant's occupancy. At least the table wasn't wobbly. There's a takeaway window, a casual lunching area for groups of four or less, and a dinning area that is quite good.   I see myself coming back here, for casual lunch in the dinning area, sitting by the window and watch people walk on Yonge.   In conclusion, I'm Chinese, if you're charging me ten bucks for six spring rolls cut in half, they better come with room service, and promise to 'love me long time.'"}
{"text":"This review is for the weekday Lunch tasting menu $15.99 and we upgraded to premium for $2 which gets you sashimi, some specially rolls, and sizzling platters.   Service and ambiance were overall good considering it can be super hectic at lunch time - reservations highly recommended.   I'm just gonna go through the highs and lows!   THE GOOD: Kimchi fries (new dish) - it's quite cheesy but crispy, sweet and delicious! Loved!  Sizzling Kalbi beef ribs (premium menu) - AMAZING!!! Absolutely hands down the best dish and alone makes the premium menu worth it! Crispy BBQ flavour yet super tender and well marinated... And sizzling!   Watermelon feta salad - mmmm ripe watermelon carved into cute little balls, lightly dressed and garnished with mint. So refreshing!  Grilled baha sizzling platter (premium) - super salty but overall still a good dish. Fish was so tender and came with good sizzling mushrooms and onions   Hot and sour soup - piping hot! Can't go wrong.   THE BAD:  Kalbi Vietnamese baguette - DO NOT ORDER! I got a piece of bread that was dry and hard as a rock - completely inedible, even for a starving homeless person. Maybe I was unlucky.   Prosciutto wrapped melon - the prosciutto itself was pretty good! But it was wrapped around a GIGANTIC wedge of crappy unripen honey dew that was so firm with rawness! Could barely eat a bite.   Fish CAKE (new) - HORRIBLE. Hard, dry, and chewy.   Also notable: The sashimi was decent considering that you really shouldn't order sushi from anywhere but a quality sushi restaurant if you're gonna be snobby and expect fresh. We also got the Atlantic roll (raw salmon and scallop, premium menu) and it was surprisingly tasty!  Overall it's a good lunch spot. I hate that their portion sizes are so big for the tasting menu though - each dish is a big commitment!"}
{"text":"The menu item descriptions were not accurate on the menu and the server was very rude when presented with my confusion and questions. As someone with dietary restrictions the level of trust in the food was lost and the servers rudeness didn't help to build trust or understanding either.  Can't comment on the food, as i didn't actually get to the point of eating any of it."}
{"text":"OK! I know there are a lot of stars for this review! But I really do love this place, and I admit! It's because of the large, expansive patio! Since Sunday I was planning a patio dinner for Wednesday, because the nerd I am, I check The Weather Network compulsively and I knew Wednesday was going to be perfect! And I also knew that after Wednesday, the weather was going to go down. I only wish more restaurants knew of the weather because I called around and found out most patios were not open (Fabbrica at Shops on Don Mills for example will not be opening the patio until next Wednesday, March 28th).   I was getting stressed but thanks to my brain (who didn't let me down this time) it thought of Spring Rolls at Fairview. I frantically called to enquire if the patio was open but no one picked up. I took the chance and drove by and *ANGEL CHOIR* the patio was opennnnnnn. I immediately bee lined towards the most sunny, tan-able, skin-dangerous spot and parked myself down. (FYI - Moxie's next by and some other restaurants all had their patio in business).  I have to say the food is really average, but give me sun, a bottle of Pinot and I am happy as can be. And if anything, you can never go wrong with a vegetable roll (avocado, cucumber) which is what I had for dinner. Add some crispy calamari and Sexy Summer Rolls and I had the perfect Spring/Summer dinner ever.   So, if you're hankering for a patio that's open now, and you want it in the North York-ish area, you know where to go!"}
{"text":"I walked by today and saw a sign saying that the restaurant had been sold and was closing on March 26. The Spring Rolls chain seems to be going out of business. Their Brampton restaurant has closed as has their two Mississauga restaurants. I assume that the new owners will renovate the place before it reopens. Not sure when that will be as renovations always seem to take longer than planned. A Japanese restaurant will replace it."}
{"text":"Hit or miss, and lately more miss. We used to go here all of the time for lunch, but for many reasons stopped going altogether., and tonight really drove that home. The service is terrible.  So some background: Tonight, we decided to go for supper after work, which seemed like a good idea because the dining room had several empty tables. They have a new \"tasting menu\" , which seemed interesting. Even though there were several empty tables visible from the door, we were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait. After almost 15 mins and only 3 groups being sat in front of us, and those visible tables still being empty, I asked what was up and got a \"another 2 minutes\".  We left, but on the way passed the takeout window where a manager was and complained. She was rude and dismissive. She bluntly stated that their priority was the group of 50 downstairs that they are all hands on deck servicing, so everyone just has to bare with them.  We were not told this, and honestly would have not waited since they obviously were very understaffed for this.  The managers attitude that their only priority was the large group and not their dinning room. Shocking.  There are several good restaurants within 1 block of this restaurant - I highly suggest checking any of them out instead."}
{"text":"Food is great....too bad their service doesn't live up to that. It took them 30 min to bring out an appetizer plate and another 30 to bring out the main course. Ice on my drink already melted before the main course came in."}
{"text":"Next time I'm in Toronto, I will definitely come here!  So, I'm visiting and my friend who's hosting me suggested we get Thai. I didn't realize just how awesome it was going to be. We went for a mid afternoon lunch on a Friday and there was a good crowd but still plenty of seating. The food was quite nomtastic and I was pleased to take home the rest of my huge portion to eat later (and yes, it reheats well!). I had one of the specials which was quite a deal given the awesome amount of awesome food you got!"}
{"text":"A-OK definitely sums this place up nicely. I met my boyfriend for lunch here today.  It's a great lunch spot with tons of menu options (I'd say easily over 100), too many options even! Because we had a limited amount of time I felt a bit rushed with the menu. If I were to go again I'd definitely check the menu out online beforehand.  I like all the natural light in this restaurant (their ceiling is a giant skylight), and I like the round benches you sit in with the low backrests.   Between the two of us we ordered a Tom Yum Soup (only comes in appetizer size, though it's a big appetizer), an assortment of spring rolls and a Unique Satay Pad Thai (yum!). All the meals were tasty.  I noticed they offer Dim Sum brunch on the weekends.   I think the best and only way to describe our server would be...too eager.   Our server (probably new) checked our table and asked us how we were doing 30 times in the hour and a bit we were there. (Yes, 30). It was really intrusive, but I'm sure he's the exception, not the rule to the service there.  It was a great lunch.   It was a great lunch."}
{"text":"I go here often. Great AYCE place. Huge variety of sushi and hot food. Great service and awesome waitresses! I just love going. great environment and food tastes good. Although it doesn't seem to be authentic Asian food it still does its best. It's like Asian fusion. Just made by non Asians."}
{"text":"If I were a yelper 4 years ago I would have given this place 5 stars. That was when I had no car and had strip malls and square one to be my primary sources of bought food. Fast forward to present day, this place is just ordinary compared to the abundance of options throughout the GTA. The decor is great, the menu selection is diverse, service decent,  the prices... could be better.  Problem with this place is they serve different types of food but I can always think of some other place that has a better version of what they have. Dumplings, pad thai, curry etc. As a whole, this restaurant is still good though and is A-OK for sure,"}
{"text":"Perfect for a night out on the town. They had helpful staff, good portions and a good atmosphere. The food was good at an acceptable price and was very fast for a Friday before Christmas."}
{"text":"I met up with my brother to grab a bite to eat for lunch since he had a 3 hour break between classes at Ryerson. I've been to Spring Rolls many times in the past, but it had been a while. They offer a discount to students upon showing your student card so that's a plus.   The last two times I have been here I ate off the AYCE menu and in the past I have really enjoyed their General Tao Chicken and their Pad Thai. This time I ordered two sushi rolls, Firecracker Dream Roll and Philadelphia Roll off the menu for $9.99. I wasn't blown away by the sushi, but it was fine. My brother ordered one of his favourites which was the Chow Mein and he was happy.   I was excited for dessert because of all the mini options so we ordered the mango crème brulee, the tasty little bites( 3 of the brownie bites and 3 of the blondie bites), and both of the mousses with a splash. My brother enjoyed the creme brulee and I thought the little bites were good with the brownies being better than the blondies. The mousses were a let down because they had more of a jello consistency and I thought it would be more fluffy and creamy.   Based on it's location and student discount I would return here again for lunch and maybe go for the AYCE option the next time."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is my favourite place to great shrimp dumplings (dim sum style), I will go out of my way to go here and get them. The menu has a decent selection and and something for everyone. I've had about 6 different main dishes on the menu and have always enjoyed them. I have gone here for both lunch an dinner as well as with a large group of people.  I give Spring Rolls and 4 star and not 5 because every single time I've visited this restaurant I've always had either great or bad service, never really anything in between."}
{"text":"disgusting. absolute shit. it taste horrible and the amount of rice they put on sushi to make you full faster...and how  thin their sashimi is... oh did i mention that its overpriced?  the waitress is an asshole with attitude... the manager is an asshole with attitude. horrible service. you have to pay extra for parking as well... they wont validate it for more than an hour even though they take forever to make their food. i swear they do that on purpose... fucking ridiculous."}
{"text":"Ate here for supper on a gorgeous Thursday in July, and there were only three tables taken maybe in the whole restaurant, including the patio.  (maybe 30 in total?)  This location is a bit more basic in its décor than some of my preferred ones (Yonge & Dundas for example).  Still has the modern Asian touches, such as a large light sculpture in the middle of the restaurant, a few giant clear glass vases with flowers, etc.  I would say it's my least favorite location actually, and I've been to at least five of the Spring Rolls spots, which I usually give 4 stars.  Still good though.  Friendly enough service, although nothing spectacular.  I used to consider myself addicted to their famous original pad thai (thai rice noodle stir-fried in your 'choice of sauce?' which I never realized before, tossed with garlic, onion, tofu, bean sprouts and egg, topped with crushed peanuts and fresh coriander) years ago when I lived in Toronto, so I was excited to have it again after about two years of being away.  Although the dish was the same, maybe I was hungry enough, because it satisfied, but didn't blow me away for some reason.  I like their standard sweet pink sauce (compared to most restaurants where it's morebrown).  Their veggie spring rolls are quite small and average, but still taste fine.  A friend had the Assorted Spring Rolls platter (2 chicken spring rolls, 1 shrimp roll, 2 veggie spring rolls, 1 cold shrimp roll, served on mango salad.  $13) and she liked it a lot.  The Dragon martini was good, but not very strong with the mix.  I'd go back here, but only because there isn't anything else in Fairview Mall that excites me."}
{"text":"This was my first introduction to Thai food ever, from old co-workers in Toronto.  We went to the Atrium on Bay location by the Eaton Centre and before even going in, I knew I would love the atmosphere.  There were always line-ups to get in this place whenever I walked by, so I knew it must be decent.  Big, modern, chic, cool design...all the locations have a similarity with clean lines, Thai decor, fun lights and artwork, etc.   Since I had no idea what to order, I was advised to get the chicken or shrimp pad thai.  Immediately fell in love.  The tornado rolls, regular spring rolls and shrimp rolls were awesome as an appetizer.  The sexy summer rolls great too, but unless you know Thai food, they are a bit of a surprise regarding the fact that they are shrimp rolled up with carrot and lettuce in a soft rice? wrap, for dipping?  Not fried.  After this one visit, I felt semi-addicted to this place so have been back probably once a month for the last few years (the Yonge & Eglinton location, the St. Lawrence Market location, the one by Square One, and the Queen West that I can think of).  Take-out is available at all, and I've often had that.  I've often ordered delivery as well.  I find the food is best when eaten in the restaurant though.  Since becoming vegetarian, I now have either the veg pad thai, or veg chow mein, or veg Singapore vermicelli, etc.  All great.  What I miss most is the steamed shrimp dumplings.  They were my all-time favorite appetizer, but I can't sway from my vegetarianism now.    The tempury cheesecake dessert is to die for as well.  You get three separate types, small little squares of each on the plate.  You could share it, but I devoured it quite easily when I thought I was pretty full.  LOL  The mango and coconut milkshakes are good too.  Liquore licensed.  Service has varied extremely.  I've had good and not so good service.  Once at the Yonge & Eg location, our food took so long and there was zero acknowledgment of the delay.  When the food did come, there was no explanation, etc so our tip reflected that.  I'm guessing it was just a bad day, maybe short-staffed in the kitchen, but the waitress said nothing, so oh well.  Other than that, no complaints that I can recall.  Biggest thumbs down about this place is that none of the locations seem to accept debit yet - my preferred method of payment.  Once I forgot and didn't have a credit card with me, so had to leave, walk to the bank to get cash, and bring it back to them.  I could've easily not gone back, but I'm not that type of person.    Overall, still ove this place though, for the atmosphere and deliciousness."}
{"text":"The food is fine,weekday Lunch AYCE for $17.99. But their dishes and water mug are not really clean. The service is not  satisfied.Our waitress is an older woman, she forgot our items and rush to leave before we finish our order."}
{"text":"The decor, server and company were the only positives of this place. The sexy summer salad rolls and satay pad thai which were once my favourite menu items are now just ok. But I guess you can't expect much from a chain restaurant attached to a shopping mall. It's fancy food court food. Good place for a quick bite but not for a date or dinner with friends."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. It was the first time I visit this location I normally go to the one near Dundas but this time I decided to go with my friends to this location. When we entered we had to wait for over 7 minutes to be seated although the restaurant was 80% empty, the waiter was distracted all the time he even took the order wrong and brought us a non- Viggie Spring Roll although we told him we Only want Viggie dishes. When i confronted him he was rude and said this is what you ordered and mumbled words in an Asian language that i am not familiar with. the rest of the evening he ignored us completely and avoided passing near our table.  Basically food was too salty and greasy; not tasty at all and not worth the money we paid.  Just dont go there its not worth it! Their service is horrible and food is not tasty the only good thing about this restaurant that the design looks nice and deceiving!"}
{"text":"Me and some friends from the gym raid this place every so often for an all you can eat get together. It goes without saying that 9 guys at 250+ pounds can consume a lot of food! Most other all you can eat places, when faced with series of large eating machines, would begin to salt the food, make us wait an excessive amount of time for our additional orders, etc - this place is not like that. Our 22 steaks, 20 chicken skewers, 8 orders of general tao's chicken, many bowls of rice, multiple sushi rolls,etc all come out quickly after we order and taste great. I personally prefer going to Yang's sushi in Mississauga for all you can eat, but this place is all right. With tip,etc comes out to under $35 per person, and given the amount of food we consume, they may just be barely breaking even."}
{"text":"Came with low expectations and still left dissatisfied.   The spring rolls had mashed potato/taro in it? Was an interesting surprise. Pad thai noodles clumped together, mixed in ketchup. Chow mein noodles also clumped in a weird sauce. There was this vegetable side dish with a offputting sour sauce. Har gao has mushy shrimp with really thick skin. Everything was so wrong. This is definitely the worst Chinese food I have ever had, and even the greasy food court food is like Michelin quality compared to this. Main dishes were around $18 each!! The only food that was decent was the calamari.   We were a large group of 16 people and we had the downstairs to ourselves. None of our plates got cleared once, or our waters refilled."}
{"text":"Best AYCE in the city hands down!  What I LOVEEEE about this place is even if sushi isn't your thing, the Tasting Menu has something for everyone  A ++++"}
{"text":"The food is decent for the price, the staff is very friendly with excellent customer service love there Pad Thai & rolls. Restaurant is always very clean"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Friday night with a friend and it was a good time. We enjoyed the $26.99 all you can eat premium tasting menu. It was probably one of the best AYCE places I have ever been to. I started off with the mango salad and my friend had the hot and sour soup. Both were great. Our favorite starter was the triple cheese dumplings which was a flaky crab and cheese filled pastry.  I had the sashimi which was good although the pieces were cut too thick for my liking. The presentation for each dish was always beautiful.  I really like the size of the main courses which were just enough so that you could try various things. I had the lamb chop. We finished things off with green tea  and coconut ice cream.  Oh and we also had wine. A bottle of 2013 sauvignon blanc cost us $25, which was reasonable.   Overall I would say it was a really enjoyable night with lots of great food in a nice atmosphere for the price paid. Definitely going to go back!!"}
{"text":"Ok, the food is not exactly disgusting--but it is not particularly tasty.  This is an asian fusion chain restaurant that leaves something to be desired.  I agree with Andrew Y that the place gets a little credit for interesting decor."}
{"text":"Service: Wonderful service! The waiter was very nice to me and he kept pouring me water (because I drink a lot of water)! He was really polite when i asked him about the menu and he apologized for the wait (I thought the food came at a decent speed).   Food: Mediocre to Ok. The dish i ordered was SALTY! That's why i kept drinking water. It was a noodle dish seasoned with soya sauce. The dish was below average in taste... I thought it was just salty and the flavor was very one-dimensional. The beef in the noodles were good; perfectly sauteed. I posted a pic of it on yelp!   My friends ordered other dishes; i tried a bit of theirs. It wasn't that much better. For example, their fried rice was mushy and they only placed a few pieces of shrimps into it (how cheap!). That dish had very bad texture and was bland! Even I make better fried rice than that!  Environment: Very upscaled! The washrooms were very clean!   Prices: This place is more expensive than other places I've been to! Dinner AYCE is $27.99 on Sunday (before tax and tip)! That's why i just ordered a dish instead! For the taste, the food is definitely not worth its price! You might as well buy food inside the food court at Fairview mall! A lot of the fast food places taste A LOT better and for less than half the price!  Overall, I don't recommend this place! Just because you go to restaurants for its food and their food is kinda shitty!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time yesterday with my friend. The restaurant was quite empty (only one other table was filled), so we got to choose where we sat. We had an option of ordering from the all you can eat menu vs. a la carte. We decided on all you can eat for $25 per person. You can order so many things off the menu because they all come in taster sizes. The only downside was that the food took a while to come out (I wonder how long it would take with a busy restaurant), and it was FREEZING in there. I had mentioned it to our server and he informed us that it was 15 degrees! However, everything tasted delicious. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"you can't make your heart feel something it won't  I'm not a Spring Rolls eater.  I make the odd exception for newness - they started serving all-you-can-eat lunch for about $15 (Monday to Friday) per person.  Bana was excited about ordering some gyoza and cheese dumplings.  I was excited to see Bana.  The menu has a wide assortment of dim sum, thai, chinese, and sushi.  No wait, I take that back, they don't actually serve sushi.  The spicy tuna roll was smoked salmon and some random hot sauce.  It's highly offensive.  Their dragon roll was topped with smoked salmon too.  Calling any of that sushi is like saying Madonna is humble.  You got that right?  But I am still taking five minutes out of Monday to tell you that their lunch buffet is 50/50.  50 percent of me didn't mind it, and the other 50 percent of me wants to delete his post.  The shrimp rolls were yummy. Shrimp rolls are always yummy.   Like all 50/50s, just order with a crtitical eye, and you can have a decent meal.  Stay away from the sushi, expect less than authentic and you're guaranteed a quick, diverse meal."}
{"text":"For a long time this was a staple for me. As of late, the quality has changed. My last visit resulted in food poisoning."}
{"text":"When I walked in, it was lunch time (around 12:30) and there weren't a whole lot of people in there, and it was pretty quiet. There were very few waiters/waitress, and the bartender was just cleaning his glasses. I was confused, as there was no one to greet me or welcome me. I was kind of lost. The bartender was just glancing at me walk around, looking for the group I was supposed to meet up with.   The decor was definitely impressive. The \"hallway\"  The waiter was extremely patient and kind. The food... well, although the restaurant is called \"Spring Rolls\", their spring rolls were pretty bland. It didn't have a lot of taste that would make it anything special, and it was a bit, tasteless. Their beverages were great, although they take a bit of time to get them to us.  I also ordered a few main courses:  Sweet and Sour Chicken: It was quite bland, and tasteless. But the sauce was also dripping and it didn't really stick to the chicken. In my mouth, it was sauce for 3 seconds, then just chicken. The flavour just fell off. The texture on the chicken is great though.  Garlic Bok Choy: It was really amateuarish. The bok choy had little garlic on it, and the oyster sauce was just over the board. It had too much sauce, it was too salty. The bottom of the bowl had water from the boiled bok choy, which washed off the sauce from the bok choy in the bottom. Not to mention, the water and oyster sauce mixing is just disgusting. The bok choy also drips whenever I try to bring it up to my mouth.  The sushi was also really bland. Nothing that really catches my attention. But the chicken wings were amazing. It tasted mildly spicy, but the flavours really stuck, and the texture was just... wow.  Overall, the time is takes for us to get the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Over priced. The food is okay and underwhelming. My fried banana dessert was terrifyingly horrible. How can you get such a simple dessert wrong. The star rating says it all so I shall let it do most of the talking."}
{"text":"Decided to try the sushi menu one night with a coworker after work and liked how the service was great - forgot his name but he was an older Caucasian gentleman with dirty blond hair tied in a low pony tail. If you ever want great service - get him! He's highly informative, always attentive and very friendly. And when we tipped him he shot us a compliment haha which always works wonders but he deserved every penny!  Other than that my coworker ordered me some of those deep fried cheese items with a raspberry sauce mmm that was yum! I will say it did put a downer how dessert cost an extra $3 and sashimi was also an added cost. I find most places that don't do AYCE normally do charge extra for sashimi but still =( was a tad disappointed!  I would definitely come here again and most likely for the sushi menu"}
{"text":"It was surprised because this Spring Roll is not as good as the others! I have tried other locations and they can keep the standard.  However, the one on Front street is not as good. The wait is long, food is not cooked well and the services is so so."}
{"text":"spring for rolls, and nothing else at Spring Rolls.  need a quick snack and a bevie before the show? pop in to Spring Rolls, sure. order a fresh roll if you're feeling health-conscious. or perhaps a tornado roll if you're feeling naughty.  but if you think you'll get anything besides overly sugary and/or spicy meals in spring rolls... skip! next. your money is better spent on food court \"fusion\", after, of course, some decent rolls and expensive drinks."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls has mastered the art of mediocrity to the masses. Nothing taste over the top or overly memorable, they play safe on everything and you get plenty (too much) rice to fill you up.  The presentation is naile and the price point is good. They always seem to be busy. Personally I like the spring roll platter, its a side dish with several types of spring rolls and mango salad. It is meant to share but it can be a meal in itself, usually very satisfying and hard to mess up. I'm not fond of Spring Rolls but do go from time to time with friends because they like it."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.   Average is the best way to describe the food. Most dishes are not as good as some of the specialty asian restaurants with better quality. On the plus side, you get a wide variety of north american asian style fusion dishes. Atmosphere is the same as most locations. Service is usually good. I found the dishes to be a little salty."}
{"text":"I have been here many times already with my Ryerson Buddies. We love this place, very relaxing, Food is great. Service is Best.  We love those statues they have in there. Great Architect."}
{"text":"Don't know why I keep coming back to this location!  Bartenders are always useless!  More interested in talking to friends then knowing their own drinks they sell.  Last time there, even got the wrong sauce with the spring rolls. If they don't know what sauces go with their own namesake dishes, they should just give up now!"}
{"text":"Luckily I didn't read the yelp reviews before coming to eat here.  We were just shopping at the mall on a Tuesday and were getting hungry and didn't feel like eating simple mall food.  Stopped by and found this great place.  The decor is very chic. clean and modern - very inviting.  The place was moderately full which on a Tuesday would be unusual for NY (where we're from).    We do like buffets and there are a few of them where we're from - but the concept of all-you-can eat without the crowded food lines was intriguing.   The concept of Spring Rolls is that you can constantly order as much as you want and the servers would bring the food to you.  So there are some plusses and minuses about this.  First and most important, this means you should be getting fresh servings of whatever dishes you order.  Most everything is cooked to order.  However, if they are really really busy, I can see things would take a lot of time if they are making dishes one by one (rather than a whole load at a time).  Last night it was perfect and everything came out promptly after ordering.     Second, having someone serve you instead of you going up to get the food means that you can talk among your table without interruptions.  I really like the small portions (Asian version of Tapas).  With buffets, sometimes your eyes are thinking much faster than what your stomach says and you end up getting WAY too much food.  Here, the food is paced and you're able to try many items and it's kind of exciting to figure out what comes next.  The food is expertly arranged so it looks inviting (not just slumped on a dish).  So we had many different dishes and didn't walk out of there unable to stand up straight (from eating too much) because it was paced eating.    The sushi is definitely on the \"cheaper cut\" but the rice was firm and chewy.  Can't expect all-you-can eat places with reasonable pricing to serve top notch fish.  Absolutely loved the Chicken on a skewer - very tender and marinated perfectly.  The NY strip steak was perfectly sized and very flavorful.  The ice cream was absolutely delicious (don't know if it was \"homemade\" but definitely had that homemade taste with the bits of coconut inside the coconut ice cream).  If you're out on a date - this is a super place.  They serve you in a modern, clean place with mood lighting with very attentive servers delivering what you want (without needing to get up and get more food) while both can talk about what is coming out next and discussing how you liked each dish.  Overall, we absolutely love this place.  The servers were very very prompt and very attentive.  The food is mostly perfect and the ambiance was inviting.  I can see how this place can slow down on a busy weekend so maybe better to plan this on a weekday if possible.  This was a super place to visit and definitely on the next drive up we will come here again.  I'm really sorry to see a few poor reviews but really - it is a great experience and the prices were very reasonable for what you got."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Served cold and undercooked. We did all you can eat and literally everything we order was so poor. What's a disappointment. To top it off the service was bad."}
{"text":"I love Spring Rolls! I've been to 3 locations and I've never been disappointed. The servings are huge, definitely you get your money's worth and the food is always very tasty. I particularly love the Pad Thai Chicken!"}
{"text":"I like all the spring rolls locations for the \"all you can taste \" menu. The food is prepared and served as if you are ordering a la carte. The service is always excellent and the atmosphere is classy."}
{"text":"I wish there were more spring rolls opening in the GTA. The food quality is so good  especially for an all you can taste establishment.  The Mississauga location has a nice environment and the service is top notch. Once again it loses a star because of price but you get what you pay for. Come hungry."}
{"text":"This entire franchise is overhyped. This place is usually full, I don't know why.. The food taste horrible."}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and it's not so bad. The decor is very funky and cool. I've never had to wait for a table here either. The past couple times I have been here was to get the ayce menu. You have to tell them up front that you want it otherwise they won't offer it to you, which I find odd. They have a pretty good menu for people like me who don't eat seafood. I love love their veggie rolls. Always so fresh. I find it odd that they don't offer you a pen and paper to write down your order like other ayce places but I think it's to deter you from ordering so much. The portion sizes are pretty reasonable and they come out promptly. Sometimes they forget to bring all the items but just a friendly reminder will do the trick. I don't like that you have to pay an extra 3 dollars to get drinks and desserts included in the ayce as the menu is already fairly expensive. It's a decent night out but for ayce I'd go to a restaurant that specializes in it"}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is to chinese food what Swiss Chalet is to chicken, a gross misrepresentation of something that's usually good. Every meal I've ordered from this place, or any Spring Rolls for that matter, has come out tasting like watered down mush."}
{"text":"Good modern open atmosphere.   The staff was really nice and knowledgeable.  My only complaint is they were a little slow and not very attentive once you have your food.  I like to have my drink refilled when it has been sitting empty for 10 minutes.   I had the Satay Pad Thai and it was excellent.   It came recommended from the server and she was spot on.   I wish I would have tried the all you can eat Dim Sum, but given how slow they were I would been there for 3 hours.  (there is a 2 hour limit on the menu).   I would try them again if I am back up in Toronto."}
{"text":"Guys - get rid of the tip option on your debit machines at the pick up/express food window!!!!  I work at aob so if I'm in a rush I want to grab my pre made sushi rolls, pay ASAP and get out. I'm not going to tip you for no reason!!!!  Waste of time and irritating every time I see the tip screen!!"}
{"text":"My first experience with the Spring Rolls chain was pretty good.  First off, I really liked the interior. Very intimate, and the seats/tables were very nice. Our server was MIA for a good portion of our visit, but she was very courteous while she was around.  The menu in this place is insane! I'm sorry, but with a bible like the one they give you, at least give us a few more minutes than the standard server reading time. No, I'm not ready, I'm only on page sixteen so far!  Anyway, time was of the essence (it was near closing time), so I went straight for their 'famous' pad thai. I have to say...for being famous, I expected better. It was pad thai and I loved it, but of the 3 times I've had it, this one was the weakest entry. I also got some spring rolls as well, and they were good. Nothing special. Just good. The prices seemed pretty standard.  I really liked the atmosphere in this place, and would like to return. Not to mention that the last page that I got to read of the menu left it on a pretty big cliffhanger."}
{"text":"I came to Spring Rolls last night and the food and service were great.  We ordered off of the All You Can Eat menu and were really impressed.  The employees were very friendly and attentive.  They let us know when last call was (we got there very late) and brought us everything we ordered.  We started with the soups.  We ordered the Tom Yum Soup and the Szechuan Hot and Sour Soup.  Both were very good!  The Tom Yum Soup was out of this world.  It was so delicious, I asked for half a bowl more because I wanted to enjoy the flavour.  Next we ordered appetizers, sushi rolls, sashimi, curry, steak, lamb and more.  I didn't try everything because I'm gluten intolerant but my friend really enjoyed the meats, sushi rolls and the curry dish.  I really enjoyed the sashimi, lamb and tataki.  Tataki is sashimi that is seared with a flame.  I had never tried that before and was excited to try something new.  The flame almost created a sweet external flavour around the fish.  It was very good!  For dessert we ordered a scoop of mango ice cream and fruit.  The fruit was presented very well.  I asked for very little and they dressed the plate with raspberry sauce.  It gave it that extra touch that made ending my meal with fruit extra special.  I would definitely go back to this location.  They offer excellent service and great food!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch yesterday and the food was really fresh. I ordered the sashimi combo for one and added a Tom Yum Soup to my order for an additional $2.59. I was really satisfied with the portion and promotion. The sashimi combo could definitely serve two people or give you a second meal of you have someplace to store it until you get home.   The Tom Yum Soup was perfect. It was so delicious. It was the perfect combination of sour and spicy. The sashimi was also really good. The salmon and white tuna melted in my mouth. The red tuna was okay but the other two fishes knocked the red tuna out of the water.   I was also in a rush so I told my waiter when I arrived. They placed my order immediately and brought everything to me extremely quickly.  I would definitely go back to this location. :)"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and had an okay experience. The menu has changed quite a bit from the days when the menu went on and on. Being someone who is both gluten and lactose intolerant, there were very few menu items I could purchase.  I ordered a sushi roll but it wasn't too filling and it was kind of plain. I really wish this restaurant could have accommodated me better. My friend had a huge order of food and I just watched him eat. After I left this restaurant I ended up buying more food somewhere else.  I'm not sure I would return here to dine again..."}
{"text":"I love three day trips when they leave me alone for the middle day. Arrive one night, have all day to explore and go home the third day. And I get a rental car which I don't always get on quick \"wait and returns.\" Such was the case in Toronto the other day. I had planned on eating at a veg buffet downtown called Commensal but sort of got shanghaied and sat at the Marriott restaurant enjoying the company of another crew who was leaving that night and didn't want to go downtown. Unfortunately all they had for me was a Hummus and Babaganoush dish, (which was bland and I needed to salt and pepper). I sat while everyone else ate and finally made a mad dash downtown. I forgot my GPS as this trip was not scheduled and \"popped up\" and didn't want to turn on my phone as data charges can be just the other side of nuts.  We made it to Commensal about 3 minutes after they closed. After springing for $10 (US!!!) for a $10 (Canadian) parking lot fee, (It's not the ten bucks, hey, I live in NYC and pay for parking all the time but their credit card machine was \"out\" and I didn't want a bunch of Canadian money from the ATM across the street and the exchange rate, when in Canada's favor is ALWAYS charged but not...well, it was the principle of the thing), I figured, \"what the hell, in for a penny in for a pound,\" and turned on data roaming. Vegout said Spring Rolls was a block away and it was open.  I thought the place was way too slick and upscale but when I went into my vegan shpiel and the waitress pointed out this ...  I'm always a little disappointed when there isn't a tempeh or seitan or vegetable protein fake \"meat\" but tofu is certainly always available in any Asian restaurant I've ever been in so I suppose it's an old faithful. Still, and don't get me wrong, just seeing that there is enough care and concern to specifically label the dishes vegan goes a long way in my book, I wish there was more than just tofu. The dish was more colorful than this nighttime picture shows and the veggies were cooked to perfect crispness. The sauce was flavorful and although the menu had a little pepper next to the description I asked for hot chili oil. I got Sriracha which is not exactly the flavor I wanted but was good and that cranked it up a bit. The noodles were rich and earthy and thick and chewy and just what I wanted.  This with a cold beer, (on sale), took the edge off my missing my first choice and still provided a decent vegan meal. With so many vegan choices in Toronto I'd be hard pressed to recommend this as a first choice but would go here as the vegan in a group any day."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and the food was really good. Their Tom Yum Soup is amazing!  It was so delicious!  My friend had the Tom Kha Soup with Chives as an appetizer and he said it was really good as well.  We both highly recommend the soups. :)  The next great feature is the menu is equipped with little GF logos throughout to make it easier for gluten intolerant people to select an entree.   I ordered the Sushi and Sashimi combo for one. The sushi was really good and the fish was fresh. I would give the sushi a 3.4 star rating. For a restaurant that doesn't specialize in sushi they did a great job.  My friend ordered a lamb dish and he said it was really good.   Our waiter was also very attentive and he did an excellent job.  Spring Rolls at the Sheppard Center definitely earned a solid 4-stars!"}
{"text":"Four stars go to the manager who was on the floor at lunchtime during yesterday's rainy Monday crowd.  The woman who sat us seemed confused and nervous (new, maybe?) and the waiter in our section was slammed by a party of at least 15.  In order to make sure we didn't get forgotten, the manager took care of us personally and he did a terrific job.  He was fast, courteous and efficient.  Plus, he made sure to get our order in before that of the big party.  It's true that the food here is so-so, but we were so hungry and grateful to our manager/server that we didn't care. Thanks to you, nameless manager!  Vegetarian score: 8/10 - most everything that comes in meat also comes in veggie."}
{"text":"Don't plan a big group event at Spring Rolls.  I was a guest at one and although the conversation was fantastic (so we had a great time), the food was disappointing.  If it wasn't for the nice girls serving us, this would have been my first one-star review.  As a student a number of years ago, I ordered take-out from Spring Rolls often to get me through late-night study sessions and group projects.  I always found the food passable.  It was pretty tasty and they delivered - that was all we needed.   But last night's dinner was...well...watery.  They offered us a set menu and between all my friends, I tasted most of the options.  Fresh rolls were filled with lettuce and pretty much nothing else.  Mango salad was passable, if nothing interesting.  I appreciated the cashews on top.  The shrimp soup was VERY salty and most of the party who ordered it left some over in their bowl.  The mains I tasted were watered down and one-note.  Veggie pad-thai had no depth of flavour, but just tasted of sweet tomato.  The veggie curry was pretty awful.  Flavourless tofu (and I love tofu) and undercooked veggies dredged in a heavy coconut sauce that tasted of...well...coconut.  It was like someone was holding a pillow over the flavour and suffocating it to death.    The desserts were the worst (sadly).  Mango creme brulee had a crust so thick, we were literally unable to crack it without pounding it with our spoons.  And the custard inside was thick and gluten-y.  Portion sizes were inconsistent on this dish.  It was as if the kitchen had run out of ramekins to put the custard in, so they started using ones half the size and hoping no one would notice.  Luckily, it didn't taste good enough for anyone to be jealous.  Coconut sticky rice was salty, not sweet, and served with a berry sauce that tasted like watered-down jam.    The high note?  The bathrooms were quite lovely.  Nice bamboo back-splash in the stall.  Gave me ideas for my new house.    Vegetarian score: 8/10.  Can't find fault there.  Now time to wash my complain-y mouth out with soap."}
{"text":"Had Pad Thai and Singapore Vermicelli.   The pad thai itself was good, but the salmon that came along with the plate tasted not that fresh.  The vermicelli was ok too.  Service was so so. Looked like they have a very strict service policy, only the one who's being assigned to your table can bring you water, regardless of how long we had been waiting there."}
{"text":"Below average sushi and sashimi, even for all you can eat sushi standards. Rice was hard and the red tuna sashimi was bland. Salmon sashimi was the only thing that tasted decent. For the nigiri sushi, fish portion was thin. The eel piece was also extra small. Fried calamari portion was quite small, but at least it was hot and quite tasty. But for 8.99, it didn't seem worth it.  Below average service. I was not able to order all you can eat when if the rest of my party ordered a large carte. Our server, while competent, was unfriendly. The fried calamari took a long time to come. I'm not sure if it was because it was a party of 8, but 15% gratuity was added automatically. In my opinion, I'm not sure if their service deserved 15%.  The final thought of the meal was \"not worth it.\" Will not return.  Food quality: 5/10. Service: 5/10. Value: 5/10. Overall: 5/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"As if my visit here hadn't already started terribly, with having to wait 10 minutes to be sat while the restaurant wasn't even busy, then it took forever to get a server over to our table, followed by having my water delivered with a fly in it.. are you kidding me? Disgusting. How could you possibly not notice that before delivering our drinks. Makes me question the cleanliness of their kitchen. Anyway, that was obviously the final straw for me, I decided to not even wait for my food after that, and instead went to eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"I used to like spring rolls.  But that was over 8 years ago. When there was only this location... when it was that narrow restaurant with no upstairs seating... when it used to be authentic Thai cuisine.  Spring Rolls is now only semi-so-so.  Despite my nostalgia, I still go to Spring Rolls. It's where many of my non-Asian friends insist to eat. They repeatedly order the shanghai noodles which implies it's good. I've stopped eating these after ordering them once - I like my noodles to have some taste. Thank you very much.  Spring rolls hasn't lost all of their touch... their springs rolls are still the highlight of the restaurant. All of them are, especially the shrimp rolls.  My vote for spring rolls is yay for appies and nay for entrees."}
{"text":"Tasteless food, inflated prices, and skimpy portions of meat make Spring Rolls a big disappointment.  Chicken Pad Thai (#T8) had only a few pieces of chicken thigh.  Stir-Fried Broccoli w/Beef (#C8) had huge pieces of broccoli that were neither bite-sized nor tender, and like the Chicken Pad Thai had only a few morsels of meat.  With so many other options for Chinese and Thai food in the area, the restaurant's pleasant decor isn't a sufficiently compelling reason to support a place like this."}
{"text":"Did you really name your restaurant \"Spring Rolls\" with that quality of a spring roll!? Ugh. What the hell were they thinking!?  The spring rolls here are disgusting! I couldn't even finish mine. That's not to mention the other terrible aspects of this restaurant, including their service.  The location is beautiful, kind of a lounge feel, but that's all it has. The food is overpriced and gross, and the service is severely lacking. The little service we did receive was snotty with a bad attitude.  I won't go back and I will never recommend this place to anybody.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Came in for All You Can Eat lunch last Sunday...never again. I love Spring Rolls and have been to 3 other locations and have never had such awful service as I did here.  So at first the food was coming out quickly, then all the sudden...nothing. The waiter didn't come back to ask us if we wanted more food or dessert. He walked by several times over a 22 minute period and looked directly at us with our table empty and continued past. Even served other tables around us. Finally I was so fed up that I went to the front to ask to pay so we could leave. I told the manager on duty about our experience, she offered me a coupon for $5 off. Really? $5? What a joke! We each paid $18 for what was supposed to be all you can eat and 2 alcoholic beverages each and I'm offered $5 off my next visit??!! I would never go to this location again!"}
{"text":"Very attentive service- the server kept checking on me in a non-intrusive way, and the food came out fairly quickly.  The Satay Pad Thai was ehhh. It wasn't very good- way too clumpy, which seems to be a problem with non-experienced cooks making pad thai...and also tasted ketchupy vs tamarind.  But the lemongrass wings more than made up for it; hot, crispy, and 6 pieces for $3.99 on the dim sum menu. Can't beat that I also got the Hot Ginger Tea and it was spicier than i was expecting, but good nonetheless.   Will be back for take-outs. Much better customer service than Green Papaya  down Yonge"}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family tonight and overall food was ok, I mean it's pretty generic when it comes to an all you can eat menu.  One of the reasons why I'm giving it 3 stars is they advertise $1.00 oysters in conjunction with the all you can eat, but the two times I've been there within a few weeks of each, they always run out (first time was during the day and today was closer to closing time).  Maybe I didn't read the fine print?? but not sure if they state only while quantities last.    Secondly, they need to update their sashimi section menu because they don't offer Hokkigai (surf clam) anymore, but it was also on the menu the last time I went prior to today as well and it still hasn't been updated.  I think if you're not serving it at all anymore, update the menu.  Thirdly, because we had a late dinner, the restaurant was starting to close and our server should have mentioned to us that they were doing last call for orders.  Instead, she placed our bill on the table, which is fine as we finished our desserts.  However, she didn't ask if the bill was separate, didn't ask how old my daughter was to ensure she was being billed for the correct amount.  I'll give it to her, it was probably a long day at the end of her shift, but it's just mindful things to consider.  But she had to ring in our bill again as we were paying separate and my daughter was charged for a 4-11 yr old fee and she is only 3.  Aside from that, our server was pleasant and attended to us during our meal.  Overall, good atmosphere and just minor details that could have bumped the rating up a little higher.  Would I go again?  Most likely, but not as my first choice."}
{"text":"Top quality sushi at a very fair price! I'm very impressed with the variety of dishes that are included in the buffet, even though I usually stick to sushi rolls.   Service is fair, I wouldn't say over the top but not terrible either. Generally the staff only comes when we're done with our order and want to place another order.   Trendy place with nice decor, not too loud or intrusive. Glad I live across the street, especially in times of sushi cravings :)"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!!!! I will never come here again!! After our dinner my friend and I got very sick , we got food poisoned from their sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonite with family. Made reservations for 730pm, arrived early and no one was at the front counter. Figured it was no big deal and maybe someone was being seated so I stood there and waited. 10 minutes pass and I'm still being ignored by the wait staff, black lady server makes direct eye contact with me and turns away to go do other things, so I get creative and pick up the phone and call the location. Woman answers and I tell her I'm at the front door waiting to be checked in for my 730 reservation (10 min ago). A few seconds later the same black woman shows up pissed at me for calling her on the phone. We finally get seated and place our drink order, drinks never show up, food order shows up and there's a dead roach on top of the mango salad. It's not a buried roach, it was ON TOP of the fucking salad like it was a garnish or something. We call for the manager who shows up and tells us that he won't charge us for our meal, we decline and get the hell out of there because I'm not eating in a place that obviously has a combination of roach problems and staff members who don't give a damn about what they are serving you."}
{"text":"For all you can eat, it wasn't bad. Sashimi selection is a bit limited for my taste but not complaining. I liked the tempura the least but still not bad. Nice atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Really delicious food, staff are lovely, It can get a bit loud when it's really busy due to the open-concept, but all in all, a great place. Take out window is also fast and very accessible."}
{"text":"Certain dishes are very tasty and reasonable for lunch, others are a miss. I would not get their sushi. The pad thai is pretty good, and their rice dishes are good also.   My favourite dishes are the General Tao rice dish or the  Tom Yum noodle soup.  Lunch specials come with a miso soup or house salad for $9.99, a la cart in the menu most things average about $10.99 - and you get a wider selection."}
{"text":"Came here during the Holidays with my extended family, around 18 people for the ayce menu, the waitress took orders from 2 people and then wouldn't let the rest of my family order because there was \"too much\" food coming.....I mean really...!?  How can 2 people order enough for 18 people!!  Not everyone eats the same dishes.....I have never experienced such atrocious service before in a restaurant where I was not allowed to order....this place deserves negative stars."}
{"text":"I am impressed with the quality of food in the all you can eat menu.  There is a wide selection.  All the foods like hot and sour soup and Pad Thai were very flavourful and prepared beyond the basics.  There is a lot a variety of Asian and non Asian dishes and good portions sizes to try out a good amount of dishes.  Really great for big groups.  The service was polite and on time.  One critique - I would specify that there is Jello in the some of the deserts, vegetarians would really appreciate that."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Their Tom yum soup was really good but I ended up having diarrhea after I ate there so I never went back lol"}
{"text":"Came here with some classmates, got the general tao chicken. Served with a cup of rice. Taste is great, and the atmosphere feels warm. Would definitely come here again. Their desserts are also great tasting."}
{"text":"Even though the location is a bit of a busy area, i've always managed to have a nice intimate dinner at Spring Rolls on Yonge Street.   The atmosphere is lively, the decor is charming, the restaurant itself is clean, and the food is quite good. The waitstaff could be a bit friendlier, but i've never had any bad experiences with them. It is a bit of a pain that the restroom is on the ground floor, but otherwise, Spring Rolls provides a quality experience, even for a New Yorker who only occasionally visits Toronto.  I HIGHLY recommend the seafood fried rice - i could eat that ALL DAY LONG. The drinks are also pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time dining at this restaurant AND location for Mother's Day and our party of 10 had the AYCE dinner. I was very impressed with the expansive menu selection as I've been to other AYCE restaurants of a similar price range but with much less offerings. All the foods we sampled (and we pretty much dabbled in half the menu!) were quite steadily served, tasty and nicely presented. Only complaint is that because it's a taster-styled approach, the portions are tiny so you'd have to order many servings to feed your party. Our server tried his best to remember which end of the table ordered what, which is great as we were a party of 10. A few plates took a bit longer to come out but we were nearing the end of our meal by then so no harm done. Decor is quite beautiful, an upscale ambiance. Love that it's right next to a green P parking lot and Eglinton subway. This location is now on my short list for go-to restaurants for special occasions and I'll definitely come here again. We were quite impressed. Great job!"}
{"text":"This Spring Rolls is located in Fairview Mall.  However, you cannot access the restaurant from inside the mall, you can only access it from the exterior.  (There is also a Spring Rolls To Go in the food court, but this review is not for that, it's for the actual restaurant).  I was here recently with a girlfriend of mine.  We were there for lunch on a Sunday and while it was busy we got a seat right away without reservations.    They had a weekend brunch buffet for $16.99 but we decided that we didn't want the buffet, so we ordered from their menu.  I ordered from the lunch a la carte menu and got the salmon with rice.  (I'm pretty sure that the menu said it was $9.99 but when the bill came they charged me $11.99 for it.  The bill said \"salmon with rice\" so I'm sure they didn't punch it in incorrectly.  We wanted to leave and I didn't want to quibble over 2 bucks, so I just paid it).  The salmon was nicely grilled and came with a mango salsa sauce (you also had the choice of teriyaki sauce).  It also came with a few pieces of broccoli and a piece of red pepper.  The broccoli was nice and crisp, not mushy at all.  The red pepper was too soft for my liking, but it was ok.  It also came with some jasmine rice, which I felt was nicely done, although some might have found it on the dry side.    My friend had the veggie explosion sushi roll (mango, avocado, asparagus and sweet potato tempura roll), but she didn't want the sweet potato tempura on top, she wanted to substitute avocado for the sweet potato.  Initially our server was hesitant and unsure if that would be ok, but in the end they made the substitution and they didn't charge her any extra for it.  She said the roll was good.  Our server re-filled our waters several times without being prompted (I had regular ice water, but my friend requested hot water, and they even refilled her hot water from one of those hot water carafes for tea).      Overall, I was pleased with the meal.  My dish was not as oily or greasy as I would have expected from a chain restaurant.  I felt that the calibre of the food is much better than the average chain restaurant.  I would go back."}
{"text":"I was kind of weary of going to Spring Rolls, since I don't really like Thai food that much.  But pretty much every dish was done well - pad thai, mango chicken were both very tasty with good flavours. The dim sum was on-par with Chinese dim sum places.   The only thing that was lacking slightly were the rolls - but for this type of buffet, no one really expected them to be authentic. The server forgot a few items, but that was to be expected for a large party.  They charge for tea - but the presentation of it is beautiful.  It comes with a tea-bag with a sword on top.  There's a napkin wrapped around the glass, to procted your hand from the heat.  I'd come back again!  It was a bit expensive (we were taking someone out, so it was about 24 a person), but nice to do once in a while."}
{"text":"Bug larvae in water glass.  Advised waitress, she asked me if i wanted another glass of water.  #stayclassy #toronto"}
{"text":"While the atmosphere is good for a casual meal, the food has a unique (not thai) taste that didn't suit.  We ordered the pad thai since we wanted a tasty, know-what-to-expect type of dish.  The pad thai here is very different and has tomato sauce in it which introduces a more acidic flavor than I like.  We also had the mango chicken which was not particularly good with an overpowering sauce and under-ripe mango."}
{"text":"3.75++ We did like our meals here. Chicken & Rice entree, Pho Beef Soup (not enough veggies), Beef & Broccoli & Rice entree. Good service and nice people everywhere mostly. Nice decor and great prices."}
{"text":"I looooooove thai food... not in spring rolls though... it's ok to come here for food on a lunch break maybe or while waiting for the movie at the cinema... but not the ultimate food destination.  what makes me put 2 starts is not even quality or authenticity of food but the smell of fried cheap oil that surrounds this restaurant whenever you pass it on the street...there is also a hint of that smell inside in some parts of the restaurant...   other spring rolls locations would probably get a higher rating from me."}
{"text":"I have eaten here quite a few times ever since I moved into the area.  I enjoy the AYCE menu and the service is as prompt and friendly as can be expected in an AYCE establishment.  I love their mango salad and spicy salmon roll.  Fresh tasting and absolutely delicious.  I used to like this place a decade ago but stopped going because the quality has gone down.  But now with this revamped menu,  I like it again and even more..  Even when I takeout the staff are really friendly offering me a beverage while I wait with a nice smile.  Sometime when I cannot make up my mind what I want to eat but I want a bit of everything this is where I go.  I hope that you try this place and give it a fair shake and like it for what it is.  You definitely get a bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Oh, Spring Rolls.  I went to your downtown locations when I was an undergrad, and sitting in an orchid-filled room sipping a lichee martini and eating Thai felt like the height of cosmopolitan sophistication.    The Y&E area Spring Rolls is even prettier than the downtown branches, for my money.  It occupies an ill-starred location that was a Fran's a few years ago, a Hooters a few years before that, and back in my childhood was Lime Rickey's, a two-story shiny retro diner with gigantic sundaes that were the pinnacle of indulgence.    The Spring Rolls people have done a lovely job of refurbishing the restaurant, and the second floor is actually gorgeous after dusk - backlit strips of richly patterned glass glow against dark wood and the dark city.    Now, the food.  Sigh.  Have I become jaded and spoiled, or was it always this bland?  I don't think so - I think it has gone downhill.  Even the downtown locations don't seem as good as they used to be.  Maybe inertia has set in, but portions seem smaller and blander.  The lichee martinis are still wonderful, but I can make them at home now."}
{"text":"Went out for a family lunch around 2pm. It wasn't too busy but we were fully ignored by the servers/hostesses for a good 5 minutes until my sister called out for their attention. Before ordering anything we informed the server that our brother has a peanut allergy and he quickly replied \"yea yea its no problem.\" We ordered maybe 5 or 10 minutes later. When the food arrived there were PEANUTS ALL OVER THE PAD THAI. My other sister refused to confront the server as she felt sympathetic for him as people can forget things. But allergies are a serious issue. My brother could have died if his allergy was more severe.... Admittedly the food was pretty good so I give it a 2 star. But the service was a NO."}
{"text":"Came here for a girls night and ordered oysters, dim sum, sushi, brownies for dessert + drinks. Great food, great atmosphere + decor and great service. I should come here more often"}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE!!  GAWD. The food tasted like it came from the frozen food section of a supermarket (a low-end supermarket at that). I'm not kidding.  Food here is bland, bland, blaaaaaaand and very crappy.  If you know what real Asian cuisine is, you'll only be disappointed. Being of Chinese descent, I was INSULTED. It's like taking an Italian to Pizza Hut and telling him they serve good Italian food. Don't do it unless you want a knuckle sandwich!"}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of the Yonge and Sheppard Spring Rolls- Mostly because it is one of the biggest restaurants ever. Place is like a banquet hall.  Wonderful Decor- with tiered flooring. With the most bottom row facing Yonge St traffic.   They have this great offer with the buck a shuck for oysters. I ended up getting the half dozen and a beer for $10.99.   Honestly, was a great appetizer; which almost filled me up when combined with the beer; Not going to lie. I had to take home my main dish which is by far my staple item every time I go to Spring Rolls- Mango Chicken. Must Try- imagine sweet and sour chicken at any regular chinese place but morphed into a mango chutney like sauce. Also accompanied by crispy yummy stir-fried green's. One of my fave things in the world."}
{"text":"There was nothing wrong with our food. However, my friend and I were interrupted by a young man, who for some reason, began staring at us, put his hands down his pants and began jerking off, while moaning loudly. While we later learned he had a developmental disability, there is still no excuse for masturbating in a restaurant. Not only did our water not handle the situation, he got mad at us and another couple sitting nearby for disturbing him while he was serving another customer. We asked to speak to the manager and were first lied to that he wasn't there, when in fact, he was. When he came to speak to us, he refused to apologize, said it was our responsibility to ask to be moved and since there was nothing wrong with our food, he could only give us a 10% discount. Both him and our waiter were extremely rude and basically victim blamed. While I get that some things are beyond their control - especially concerning the young man with the disability, there were many ways in which this restaurant could have better handled the situation. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Pretty lackluster meal. Pad Thai was very dissappointing. It was tasteless and shrimp were overcooked. Cashew chicken was okay. Won ton soup was the highlight of the meal."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting.   I ordered satay pad thai and it was drowned in sweet and sour sauce. The tofu in there tasted rotten, had a weird bitter taste. My friend ordered sushi and the salmon wasn't fresh.  We both had better for cheaper prices. Like Salad King for thai food was way better."}
{"text":"This is exactly why I prefer to go to non-chain restaurants to eat.  I don't really understand why anyone would go here when there are so many better options available for Thai/Chinese/Asian...but maybe that's just my food-snob side coming out.    This restaurant isn't terrible.  But it's nothing special.  Everything is just very average - except for the service.  The service is not average.  It's awful.  Slow doesn't begin to describe it!  I'm often in the area for work, but we never try to eat there on our lunch hour because we know we'll never make it.  It doesn't matter whether it's busy or empty.  Even using the take-out option is unbelievably slow!  The one time I went that route, two of four people ordered the exact same thing - mango salad - and one came out 20 minutes after everyone else had received theirs.  How does that even happen?  First off, it's cold so it's not like they needed to spend time cooking it.  Secondly, someone else had ordered it!  Just make double at the same time, I've never even worked in a kitchen but even I could tell you that.    The décor is nice though, it's definitely interesting.  Try finding the bathrooms though, I dare you!  I've been a few times and every time I feel like I'm going the wrong way.  And the doors are completely camouflaged against the walls...I just want to wash my hands!    All in all, decent Canadian-ized Thai fusion food, nice décor, slooooooooow service.  Go somewhere else if you can."}
{"text":"So back in nineteen-dickety-two, cause that's what we called it back then, I was a big supporter of Spring Rolls when it was this this single tiny location on Yonge St.  It was a interesting concept where I could get all the asian food groups I wanted in a single place.  If you had a large group and couldn't decide if you wanted Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, or Japanese, you could come here for some decent food at a decent price.  It solved all of our problems.  Fast forward to the scary future.... they're everywhere now offering mediocre to subpar food at something way more overpriced.   I hadn't been to a spring rolls in years, but on this occasion we were celebrating a couple of birthdays, and we occupied half the place.  They're now an all-you can eat buffet.  And it wasn't long before I had all I could eat.  Not that we were full, but the food was just not good.  The best part of the meal was the ice-cream cake... that we brought ourselves.  Oh well.. you can turn back the clock I guess."}
{"text":"Just went tonight and am very disappointed with their food.  Service was great.  Long wait time.  The food used to be decent, but now, I feel like they are serving Thai food from an international buffet.  I had the \"unique\" Satay pad thai, it was ridiculously salty.       My friend had the Cantonese chow mien; let me you, ordering Chinese food from a Thai dominate restaurant was a bad idea.  It tastes like they pour half a bottle of soya sauce on the plate and the egg noodle was worst than the noodle from an instant noodle pack.    Friday night dinner has been ruined :("}
{"text":"I got FOOD POISONING from this place! I was here last night and ordered the Cheese Bruschetta and Boston Lobster Sushi Roll, and this morning I was throwing up and running to the washroom every half an hour.   A girlfriend of mine who was with me has been throwing up as well, so it wasn't just me. I went to the doctors today to find out I got food poisoning!   I will NEVER come back here again! I'm pretty sure I got sick from the lobster roll. Please reconsider eating here."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this restaurant is still in business because the food is just bad.  I went for early dinner with my best friend there because we decided to give it another chance after 4 years of not going here.  And it has reconfirmed my decision to never go back again.  Firstly, the decor is nice I have to give them that and the atmosphere is quite trendy and relaxing.  It is the typical fashionable, trendy and hip restaurant that you would see as you pass by on the streets and think it's a very nice place.    Secondly, my friend ordered a pad thai and it was barely warm, the colour was really off and she said the taste was far from good.  As for my plate, I ordered some beef dish with rice and as well the food was barely warm, the sauce was watery and the taste was so simple.  A bowl of cereal and milk at home would have been twice as good.  Lastly, the service sucked!!!  Most real authentic Chinese restaurants dont have such a thing as excellent service and I dont expect it because you go there for food and not service.  But at Spring Rolls, it's Asian FUSION, the key word.  I would expect some decent service considering the prices are not your daily food court cheaps.  Our server did not ask to take our drink orders, she didn't even come to us for at least 10 minutes.  She never asked us about how our food was nor did she recommend desserts or coffee/tea.    Damn this place is the WORST I've ever gone to and will NEVER ever go back.  It was a complete waste of money and I'm someone who just appreciates having food on my plate and all things unless horrible just tastes good to me, but this one has got to go!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money. Food is Ok but service is terrible. The all you can eat menu has some variety but the big problem is that you will wait forever to get the food served to your table. If you still want to go there an advice is to order all at once so you don't have to wait too much to get more food. But probably they won't let you do that because \"they strongly recommend you to order only 6 items at a time\". So good luck with that.  Also if you go to the Bay and Dundas downtown location you may have to wait at your table for 20 minutes before the server comes and tells you \"sorry but we are not ready to make this dish today\". Then why they offer it in the menu?  Don't know why but I came back for a lunch with a friend. The qualitu of their food is getting worse. They have started to mix the chicken with a sort of flour or cornstarch so I guess the idea is you get full faster when you order \"All you can eat\". Their sushi is even worse, I ordered the \"spicy salmon roll\" and they are grinding the fish with little pieces of tempura flakes or something. Really bad quality, maybe related to a bad financial situation becasue I know they have closef several restaurants in the GTA.   Never go there."}
{"text":"Service was exemplary as the male server made sure that our tea and water glasses were full and that we had everything we needed.  The food arrived promptly and was delicious!  The Sushi and Sashimi Combo for 1 that I got was a perfect portion for me.  The sashimi and sushi were fresh and I was impressed since Spring Rolls isn't well known for their Japanese food."}
{"text":"My disclaimer is that I'm not a fan of Asian fusion restaurants.  I only go to them as a last resort.  Spring Rolls is one of those restaurants that, I, being of Chinese descent, would deem as a \"Chinese\" restaurant that makes westernized Chinese food to tailor to westerners.  To me, it is just a better-decorated Manchu Wok.  They are extremely overpriced for what they are offering (you could get authentic Chinese dishes for half of what they're charging).    Service was invisible as the servers trotted about at a snail's pace, and seemed to disappear at random intervals.  We had to wait to have our orders taken, and then wait to get the bill.  The food itself was not even what I would call average - its mediocre.  With the St. Lawrence Market just a few steps away, why eat here?"}
{"text":"Having saved up to go to what appeared to be a rather classy venue, I was thrilled to go here on a Friday night.  The place was noisy and crowded, this actually provided a nice atmosphere.  One of the hustle and bustle of an outdoor street vendor.   The service was slow, possibly due to how busy they were, and a little impersonal.  A shame really, as this was something of an event I had been building up to.  Ordering the food through iPads was pretty cool, although it did make everything seem a little less romantic.  So far, i was not thrilled, yet excited for what promised to be good, if not great sushi.  My hopes were dashed upon the arrival of the food.  I ordered a variety of maki and sashimi.  The rice was not only warm, it was hot.  As in, freshly cooked hot.  The sashimi was at least a half inch thick.  Both basic things that destroyed any faith I had in the chef.  Which I now assumed to be an untrained teenager.  The quality, continued to be this poor throughout the meal.  Begrudgingly paying the $200 for two people was far from deserved."}
{"text":"The overall quality and taste of the food was sub par. The service was terrible and even the water glass were unclean."}
{"text":"Good food, polite staff. Good ambience. Nice to take a client, girlfriend. Pad Thai really good."}
{"text":"We tried this place when visiting Toronto since it was close to our hotel. The place itself is pretty nice , trendy and good vibe. I got seating by the window so we could keep our 4 yr old busy looking out at the busy city .  We had to wait over 20 mins for service. We were about to walk away when the manager came and took our order and was saying how shorts staffed he is. My review is a 3 due to lack of service. Drinks- we ordered the white sangria which was so so and nothing to rave about. Food- we ordered beef fried rice, beef pad thai, pork noodles, tom yum soup The presentation of the food was quite nice. The pad thai and the beef fried rice is a 4. The rest were average."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness my Pad Thai tasted like they just boiled the noodles and threw it on the plate without adding sauce. Flavourless.  Without a doubt, worst Pad Thai I've ever had. I can't speak for the rest of the menu though.  On the plus side, the hostess and server were nice."}
{"text":"First time coming here for a friend's birthday party. Staffs were friendly, but I think they need more training on the job. I ordered a Sizzling Bulgogi Plater with steamed rice. I have a soft spot for korean food, so i was looking forward to my food. However, as soon as the waiter placed the plater in front of me, my appetite has immediately vanished. The Bulgogi Plater was definitely not a korean dish. The beef was stir fry with onions and a soy sauce base sauce (Chinese style). The only korean aspect of this Plater was the sidedish - kimchi but it was bad kimchi, very dry and tasteless. I wouldn't recommend anyone to come here. For the price you're paying, you can get better quality food elsewhere."}
{"text":"We just tried the all you can eat menu at the Queen street location, and it was all very well made, and tasty. They must be competing with the slew of all you can eat sushi places out there.  My only comment, as others have said.....GET A FRIGGEN DEBIT MACHINE. For the love of god, it's 2012.  Next time I'll bring seashells and gold Krugerrands. :P"}
{"text":"We haven't even got to eat our food yet but we've been here for 1/2 hour. There are two tables who came after us and already got all of their food. The waitress was no where to be found.  When we finally got the spring rolls platter, it wasn't even good. There were very few spring rolls options on the menu. If you call yourself \"spring rolls\", at least have a variety of spring rolls."}
{"text":"Too sweet. Calamari is too little. Service and environment are good. Probably won't come back"}
{"text":"I've always thought Spring Rolls was decent food, but over priced from what you're getting. The quality isn't amazing, but ok. With their new all you can eat menu, it's pretty great - there are tons of things to try like chinese dimsum, sushi, pad thais and other noodes, even kalbi - all for $18.99 on weekends, more for dinner, cheaper on weekdays.   We got a whole bunch of stuff, which came out at a pretty good pace. Some memorable ones was the Thai Spicy Noodle, Japanese Crab Fried Rice, Fried Squid (a little over cooked), Sizzling Plat Kalbi. The Kimichi Sweet Potatoe fries looks good on paper, but was lack lustre when it arrived. All portions are super small, some are bigger for sharing, but most of the Mains are only good enough for one or two people. Doesn't matter, you can order more!  Although service was decent, the narrow long table we were all sitting at really could not handle all the dishes that we had. They use white thick porcelain dishes, not really conducive to stacking, and they were heavy. They would also serve steamed buns with a plate (that's super hot) , which is so unnecessary. It really took away from the experience as our dishes kept piling up.  There also needs to be a way for everyone, especially a large party to manage their orders. Maybe the check sheet would be a better way for all this. We ordered the Stuffed Crab Head Curry twice, and it never came. When orders came, we never knew who it belonged to.   When the meal was done, we stopped ordering, there was no one there to clear our plates and basically sat there for a good 30 mins getting cold and gross.   Definitely catered to westerners, but good for if you feel like more than just dim sum."}
{"text":"Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Do not go here if you aren't forced to by your boss with the threat of termination and without a package and UI. Absolutely atrocious. They can't seem to get anything right. Sorry. Correction. Their soft drinks are fine."}
{"text":"Not much different from your average Spring Rolls, which includes watered down fusion cuisine.  Had the tom yum soup and siu mai and it was passable.  Fusion, not authentic.  What I really liked about this location though was that it has two full levels, nice bar counter with a couple of TV's and really good service.  Verdict: safe fusion cuisine for the non-adventurous."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try out this place during the weekend, since we have been hearing mixed reviews on the restaurant, some saying its \"really good\" and some saying \"it's not worth the money, time, nor effort\" ... so my boyfriend and I were \"adventurous\" and decided to finally try Spring Rolls.  Entering the place, the décor was really nice, and elegant. Our hostess sat us down in a booth, and told us our server would be with us momentarily.  When she arrived, she seemed really rude, and short with us. Every time we would ask her a question regarding the rolls,  she would roll her eyes, and sigh saying \"it's a roll with fish\" (you don't say?!) after awhile she would just point to the pictures on the AYCE menu saying \"this is what the rolls look like\" and leave ...  We decided to go with the Premium Menu, which is $3 more, and you get the chef specials, and dessert. And since we were told to \"look\" at the picture, my boyfriend decided to go with the steak (the picture looked really nice), he ordered a medium well steak, and the steak came out FLAT and it was WELL DONE - burnt to be precise ... we called our server back  and she was like \"pictures we get from google, pictures are never like the food we serve\" like WTFFFFFFFFFFF?! Didn't you tell us to look at the pictures provided??   But moving along ... we managed to try and complete our meal, we ordered a bunch of sushi, thai food, and dim sum. ... and the dim sum here is the WORST! I have had dim sum in a lot of places downtown, and nothing compares to the dry, undercook & cold dim sum they serve, and when we spoke to the server regarding the DRYNESS ... she told us \"you have to eat it right away when you get it\" ummm no, I have ordered dim sum PLENTY of times and I don't need to eat every single item once the dim sum touches my table to prevent it from \"drying\". Just admit it's frozen and the chefs at the back don't know how to steam it properly.   But long story short: I won't be coming back. The attitude of that waiter turned me off completely, and for her to give attitude EVEN more since we didn't pay her much tip is beyond me. Tip is based on performance, and attitude, if you give attitude to your customers, don't expect a huge tip."}
{"text":"AYCE Dim Sum? what is this about? I couldn't believe my eyes when my friend texted me the news. I'll assume that this deal has been going on for a while, but it also reconfirmed how unattractive Spring Rolls has been to me over the years.    At first, I was probably like you now, a non-believer. I didn't even want to give it a try. Spring Rolls isn't known for this stuff. Dim Sum is an art and it's mad delicious. How is there such a thing as AYCE Dim Sum. It made me wonder... How much Dim Sum can one person eat anyways? Well, apparently a lot...  Looking at my menu, I started to doubt that Spring Rolls could actually offer anything good. The selection available for the AYCE deal is usually limited. I was ready to be disappointed.  \"So,\" I asked \"what can you order for the AYCE out of this menu?\"  \"Everything man, let's Korean Short Rib this B#$*^!\"  He was right, almost everything was available. One of the most extensive AYCE lists I've ever witnessed was laying in front of my eyes.  In addition to the Korean Short Ribs: Sushi? BAM, they got it. Har Gow? Shui Mai? Bam! they got it. Torpedo or Tornado Shrimp? BAM! they got it. Pad thai, red/green curry, fried rice? Bam! they got it.  In short, there are tons of stuff to get. Selection is the smallest of your worries.   The best part of it all, it's all pretty good. The sushi needs work, but it's decent. I've had worst at dedicated sushi restaurants.  It's something you gotta just try. It's a decent price for what you can get and eating for 2 hours with good friends is always a good time. Expect a ginormous food coma afterwards. I suggest you fluff the pillow before heading out."}
{"text":"I asked for water twice when I sat down and the server brought it 30 minutes into sitting down. We ordered the all you can eat. We got rice, meat, sushi etc. We had to keep asking the server where our food was because it just wouldnt come out.  We ended up ordering those specific ones again.. It took way too long. Too long. I asked for hot sauce 3 times and after the third time, they brought one. Service was not good. Everything was slow or rude. I asked one of the other waiters a question and he looked at me and walked away. Plain rude. Don't give spring rolls money. Don't go."}
{"text":"One of the best Pan Asian restaurants I've been to. Food and service are great. On weekends, the restaurant offers their all you can eat Dim Sum dining special for $16.95 per person. If ordering this special, you and all your guests must order the same special, otherwise it's a la carte for all.  Waitresses are really fun and gracious, and that`s an extra plus for this location."}
{"text":"The food is fairly decent, and they serve pretty quickly too. Only thing is, if they are more responsive to a request of service, that will give them a five star."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls, as a chain, has evolved since I started going. This location in Mississauga is one of my favourites because of its location, great food, and friendly service. This one is close to Square One mall, not far from the QEW, the 403 highway, and Cooksville Go Station.  The food is generally very good and, as with all Spring Rolls locations, features some innovative takes on a variety of Asian dishes. You have a choice from either the à la carte menu or the all-you-can-eat menu, the latter of which is a great value menu if you are hungry and want to eat very good sushi, dim sum, and Thai food without limit. Unlike other all-you-can-eat restaurants where I have dined, the quantity does not diminish the quality and I definitely recommend this restaurant and others in the same chain for a fun night out.  Budget-wise, the prices here are moderate: not inexpensive, but not extravagant either. It's a great place for a fun night out with excellent food from many different Asian cuisines."}
{"text":"I love this place.  There are a few rude servers during lunch time, but it doesn't really ruin the experience.  The best part is the variety, just like the Spring Rolls near Square One.    Sushi is decent, dim sum is pretty good and thai food is decent.    Must tries: -Triple Cheese Dumplings -Breaded Torpedo Shrimp -The hao gow.   -Deep fried New York cheesecake (mmmm! and I usually don't like sweets!)  Awesome, awesome place..thank you Spring Rolls for being AYCE and \"screw you\" for being AYCE - I need to lose weight!!!"}
{"text":"Stop by on February 22, and the \"Spring Rolls Go!\" has closed for good. Will be replaced with a Mexican restaurant. The original Spring Rolls is stilled opened two doors down from this former Go! location."}
{"text":"Came with my bestie for a nice Saturday brunch - she's Vegan/Vegetarian and I'm Keto so finding a restaurant to serve the opposite kinds of food spectrums is a little tricky and Spring Rolls is always a good time.   They have a brunch tasting menu !!   Awesome..... From 11-3 on weekends for  $18.99 a huge selection of sushi, sashimi, Thai entrees, seafood platters, soups, salads and dim sum is a wonderful deal !  Oh and desserts oh my !!!   We had ; Salt & Pepper Calamari - 5 (it was breaded) Edamame - 10 always good Vegetable Spring rolls - 4 they were mushy inside and bland in flavour  Cheese wonton - 5 they were \"ok\" Satay chicken - OMG they were a 10 Cashew chicken - 5 too much sauce and sugar  Thai Basil eggplant - 7 sauce too thick Avocado roll - tasted funny  Hot & Sour Soup - 8 very tasty though portion could have been larger Salmon & Butterfish sashimi - 5 small portions Mango Creme Brûlée - 8 no real mango flavour, but too hot hot to lick the bowl !  Chocolate / Orange Mouse is good but could do without the alcohol on top   Overall this is a great deal if you come with a large appetite or a group of people     With nice hot jasmine tea sitting by the window watching the saturday shoppers head to and from St. Lawrence Market and going about their busy days was just so nice today."}
{"text":"I have been to Spring Roll's a few times in the past. I took my Mom here for Mothers day.  I really like the restaurant itself. The decoration is really nice, the tables are ok, and the chairs are comfortable. It rally has a very nice feel to it.  The service is pretty good, the waiter was nice, and he told us about the mothers days special. He managed to be around without hovering or crowding. He was pleasant to be around.  The Food:  The Spring Rolls were great, i could taste many flavours, they were cooked right.  Mango Salad - Also very good, prepared right, fresh mangos and spinach. Tasted very fresh.  Pad Thai - This was the low point of the restaurant. I've said it before, if you order Pad Thai (or order thai noodle dishes) and they don't ask you how spicy you want it on some scale. Then expect to get  dissapointing dish. Here they didn't ask and the dish was dissapointing. It lacked flavour, wasn't at all spicy, didn't have peanuts, came with an orange instead of a lemon. So, I'm not a fan of their pad thai.  Mango Creme Brule - This was fabulous. Sweet, cooked amazingly well and pretty great.  Normally I would give this restaurant a 4, but the Pad Thai pulls them down out of the stratosphere or good to great, to just - OK."}
{"text":"This review is a bit overdue as I know Spring Rolls has changed quite a bit since my first visit here.  My first visit here was just over three years ago, where they still did the prix fixe menu's and had some really good sea bass and some amazing desserts.  And I've visited two or three times since and ordered a la carte.    There's not much different here than other Spring Rolls except that their service can be really slow at times.  Food is a decent, cleaner version of Manchu Wok, but less MSG and you don't feel like crap afterwards.  The decor is also nicer than other Spring Rolls as it feels a bit more upscale.  However, my biggest qualm is the service and hence my limited visits in the past two-three years.  I find that flagging a server here can be a problem and dishes take at least 25-30 minutes to come out, even during lunch time.  In a mall, this is not acceptable, especially for such generic food.  I also remember a couple of times that my Coke took around 10 minutes to arrive. Seriously? It's just a Coke.    So would I visit this again? Meh.  I might give it another chance because I'm nice, but I'm not totally inclined to at the same time.  Maybe if a friend forces me or something..I dunno."}
{"text":"I was starving and this place looked nice. Hostess, levels, tvs, altar, aquarium kind of windows (to one of the busiest neighbours of TO), enough waitresses, free wifi, customers... But what about the food? Mediocre is the word.   Unless the owner uses the place to laundry money, I can't think why not to reduce losses and improve the food. SOS to chef Gordon Ramsay!  I ordered a special double dragon roll that was in the spare menu and included miso soup/salad. I picked the miso.  The miso tasted like those that come in an envelope: ready in 2 min.  The rolls had way too much rice. Awkward to put in the mouth. They didn't remove the skin of the cucumber, and they put too many sticks of it. The shrimps were tiny and oily. The roll as a whole was too dry. The salmon wasn't bad tho.  The service was fast and nice. They give you a dessert if you check in.  I regretted not to go inside an AYCE sushi that was on Yonge... Next time."}
{"text":"I had hard time finding something fresh on the menu. Mist if the ingredients are from a box, jar, or preserved. The worst thing I saw how a waiter was picking on his nose, touched menu books and with his dirty hands packed the silver wear in napkins. He was standing next to my table and I saw how he touch spoons and forks with his dirty hands. I had to take my chop sticks to the bathroom and wash them with soap."}
{"text":"I've ordered from multiple Spring Rolls locations for the past 10 years. I'm normally not disappointed, but today I was. The Green Curry on rice with chicken was very bland. The veggies were mushy. There was more tofu than chicken. My boyfriend and I couldn't finish more than a couple bites. I'm glad I didn't have too much, since I'm now sick to my stomach. Their Chinese style dishes are much better. The General Tao and Cantonese Chowmein are 100 times better than what I tried today."}
{"text":"I write about the restaurant located on Dundass, not far from Bay Street. I had taken my very frail mother along with two others to the restaurant for dinner last night and had a most offensive encounter with one of the greeters whose name is Kevin. He was extremely nasty refusing to seat us even when a table became available and there was no one else who needed the table. Further, he even did not want my mother to be seated on one of the chairs in the corridor ordering us to stand outside the restaurant because we were \"blocking\" the way. We left the restaurant in frustration thereafter.  I am from the USA, and such rude offensive behavior from a service personnel usually results in termination. I do hope that Kevin does not experience such rude behavior himself, especially when he is taking a sick relative or friend to dinner."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure our server, James, was some sort of service guru that descended from the mountains of service mastery to teach all the kids how to do it right. I've never had someone that was so attentive at an AYCE and the way he managed our entire row of tables was highly professional. He noticed that we were just sitting there in between rounds and came over to us to ask if we were still waiting on certain items. Wow! I don't have to chase down a waiter for food and water at an AYCE?? Amazing!  Now onto the food. It wasn't the first time I've had the AYCE here and it's consistently been pretty good. Yes, some dishes are better than others. The cooked meat dishes were very well done. The lamb chops, steak, and short-ribs were superb. They were all very tender and had great flavour and sauces. The coconut shrimp was crispy and coconut-y. The salt and pepper calamari was, surprisingly, another standout for me. It wasn't heavily coated in batter and was very tasty. There were squid and eel sashimi, which are not always available at other places, and some rather big gyoza. Even though they didn't have a lot of dessert items, I also really enjoyed their mango creme brulee.   Having said that, there were a few less impressive items. Their sushi was pretty disappointing. Even though they've scaled back on the rice ratio, it's still WAY too much. The rice was also too sticky and just ruined the flavour of the rolls. The salmon tataki was also weird. They just took a stack of regular salmon sashimi and torched the top (thin side), making it a very uneven burn. On a sidenote, there's really no need to use the Japanese names of the sashimi on the menu with no English translation available. Was its intention to facilitate some sort of constant Q&A with the waiter? Mission accomplished then, I guess.  I'm giving the food a 3.5 but the service is pushing it up to a 4. I'm not really sure why the general rating is so low for this place. Obviously, Spring Rolls has its flaws and the food is white-washed versions of Asian dishes. But like Mandarin, you don't really come here and expect food that screams authenticity. Overall, I think they've got great variety and generally, good quality. The dinner pricing is on par with a lot of other AYCE but lunch is a terrific value. Like AYCE Japanese places, they don't have sashimi during lunch but unlike those other places, they have a great selection of high-quality cooked dishes. They also have James on Friday evenings. You keep doing you, James; you are god's gift to the AYCE service world.   (29/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"I must have a love-hate relationship with this Spring Rolls.  It is only a 5 minute walk from my place.  They finally took down the all you can eat sign when they stopped doing it.  However, now they've re-introduced it and re-branded it calling it a \"Tasting menu - a premium all you can eat experience\".  What does this mean?  a) A bit more expensive ($18.99 for weekend lunch and $15.99 for weekday lunch). b) Sashimi served during weekend lunch c) Plates come out a bit slower as opposed to all at once (my nice server Alejandra explained this to me).   d) They have fewer menu items but they are done better.    The sashimi was very fresh, and as always, Spring Rolls does a great job on apps and I particularly liked the fried squid tentacles.  The other dish that I really liked was the sizzing Korean kalbi.  While the taste wasn't amazing, it was satisfying and the presentation was great.  They actually give you some huge pieces of meat, unlike other AYCE restaurants which sometimes only give you bones and fat.  Verdict: pretty good AYCE, a bit pricier though.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Instead of growing with more locations, perhaps Spring Rolls should work on their customer service issues.  My party of 5 were at the Fairview location for the All-You-Can-Eat lunch. We've been to the downtown Yonge/Wellesley location prior to this and it has always been great food and great service.  The Fairview location is NOT the same. The host staff were excellent. She prepared the table so that we had a space enough for a wheelchair.  I can't say the same for the server however. Only scowls given with a few mumbles. We ordered about 20 items from the menu to share but only 10 arrived. We asked what had happened to the rest of our order and he said 'thats it!'. I asked for my original order form where I wrote down the items but he said it is 'missing'.   The timing of the dishes was horrible. We were warned that the sushi would take 20 mins to make. Perhaps additional sushi chefs should be hired to keep up with demand of this larger establishment. I'd hate to see what happens with the dinner bottlenecks especially with larger parties.  The sushi pieces during AYCE are not very nicely presented.  Very small pieces.  Not very memorable in taste or quality.  The seaweed salad is a joke! Just a smidge of it placed on a sauce plate. Yet the mango salad (which was made with too raw mangos) was plentiful. Tornado rolls has always been my favourite here and those are always done well.   The sushi rolls are exceptionally tiny and not well presented like at other locations. We tried ordering the items that were missed from our first order but again half of it was missing.  Is this part of a management scam to limit food and maximize profit?  Sorry to say we all left hungry even at an AYCE service. Terrible.   I wrote a message to them on Facebook and the offered an apology and to send my contact to the Regional Manager.  Did that.  No reply.  Social media management/PR and store management need to be brought up in service and communication levels for such a great chain with so much potential.  Looks like we are not the only ones who see through their poor service as they seem to have many complaints."}
{"text":"Their food is only good for people that don't know anything about Asian food.  The food lacks color, flavor and texture.  Won't be here anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Really?  Some of the most tasteless, stodgy Asian food I have ever tasted.  I ordered through the online service and was told a confirmation email would be sent.  It still hasn't arrived.  I called the help line and was told the order would be ready in five minutes.  I went over to pick it up and was told it wasn't ready although I could see it sitting behind the bar.  Very poor service.  I have also eaten in the restaurant and found the service to be mediocre.  The food is bland, even the spicy dishes.  I plan to look for an alternative for good Thai food in the area."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Toronto and I keep kicking myself for not going back each time I'm in the city. Like PF Chang's, it's a mini-chain of nouveau Asian cuisine. Unlike PF Changs, this place actually does a good job. Beautiful funky decor with some great spring rolls (duh!) perfectly fried and some incredible ribs and other delicacies. Soups are great too. Hard not to like this place especially with it's proximity to St. Lawrence Market, Dominion, Hot House and so many other spots on Front."}
{"text":"Very poor quality food for the price, the salmon tasted very fishy not properly seasoned. The service was slow, one server for the entire restaurant it seemed and when I asked the manager for some service he told me to just wait for my server. Disappointing dinner to say the least."}
{"text":"This place has no redeeming quality at all. We waited half an hour for a server to arrive, drinks were delivered incorrectly, management tried to refuse drink corrections, food as mediocre, finishes plates were left on the table, and servers and management were outright rude. We went on a Monday at 7pm."}
{"text":"This place serves up not just Thai cuisine, but also Vietnamese as well. And the cocktail selection is quite extensive. But the food here is less than marginal when it comes to Thai fare. I had the red beef curry and steamed dumplings to start and both dishes were nicely presented, but lacked any substantial flavor. The beef in the curry was tough and had some cartilage to chew on and the veggies (some unidentifiable) were basically raw.   On the upside, the ambiance here is pretty darn cool/trendy (except for the weird folk music playing in the background) and the service was friendly (although not very consistent). So I'd suggest this place just to hang out and drink some fru-fru drinks, if that's what you're into."}
{"text":"WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!! The curry pai tai was disgusting, couldn't even eat half!!!!! The waiter never checked up on us, never refilled our water, got my order wrong!!!! The calamari was good but you can't ever mess up calamari. My friend ordered the salmon and it was gross too!!! Not a good place!! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE"}
{"text":"Spring Rolls was actually where I had my first taste of Thai food back when I was at the tender age of 9 and it had just opened. As a teenager, I'd often go here with my friends before concerts at Massey Hall or Kool Haus, since it was so close to Union Station. I guess I feel like I've grown up with Spring Rolls, so I have a special spot in my heart for it. It's gotten way more chain-y since then, though. They even have a location in Conestoga mall...WTF? But the food and prices are still good, and that's what matters.  At Spring Rolls, you'll get a yummy pan-asian meal at a reasonable price. I've really never been disappointed. Most entrées are in the $8-$12 dollar range. My favorites are the Chicken in Black Bean Sauce and the Curry Pad Thai. They're pretty much always busy here, but there's a lot of room in the restaurant, so tables turn over quickly. In the summer, they have a nice patio out front.  Bottom line, Spring Rolls is a good place to grab a bite when you take a break from shopping at St. Lawrence Market or if you're meeting a friend at Union. I'd take it over pricier alternatives like Izakaya or Bier Markt any day."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 1/2 star. I was completely disappointed in the food. Whatever you do DONT order the black pepper beef! The fried rice was totally tasteless it could be easily replaced with a bowl of plain white rice ( that might have more flavor) I kept thinking what will chef Ramsey would say about the crappy food being served at this restaurant :(   My advice don't waste your time or money going here"}
{"text":"I have a couple friends who always rave about Spring Rolls so I finally got around to trying it. I wasn't super impressed. I tried some maki and it was boring. I think Mandarin sushi might be better. California roll was meh. Spicy salmon was just salmon and a hot sauce I wasn't very fond of. Lots of fish, though. The virgin sunshine roll or something like that had a crazy name and was stuffed with tempura bits, unripe mango (gag), and cream cheese... I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered that one. Tamago sushi was ok. The sushi pizza was killer, I'd definitely order that next time. The miso soup was bland. The chicken spring rolls were really good.   I was a bit iffy about the staff. There was a lady decorating in the entry way who couldn't seem to be bothered to move out of the way of people using the door. Maybe after close would be a better time to decorate the entry-way than during lunch hours. My server seemed ok but then randomly started dancing around and acting thug with some friends at another table. Then when I paid him he went to all the staff and his friends at the table and asked if they had change for a $20. Guess change is a hot commodity in his line of work. The guy behind the bar also rubbed his nose with his hand and went back to work without washing. Didn't care for that much.   I'd go back if friends asked me or if I had a killer sushi pizza craving but I don't think I'll go back otherwise."}
{"text":"First time we came here, the atmosphere was very nice and comforting. The lights are dim, they have 1-2 tvs with music playing in the background (top 40 stuff).  The waitor came quick, we ordered about 6 items per order. Portions were good. Sushi was a let down. Most of it was mushed together and too big. The rice was also watery. The miso soup didnt have the proper taste, the hot and sour was great.   The dumplngs, salads, etc the apps, were ALL yummy. The main courses (mango chicken, basil beef, sweet and sour chicken) were all good. The portions are just right. We also got the 2$? I believe extra menu, which had salmon and steak, little portion but enough to fill a person after everything else, was very good.   The dessert was great. Overall I was happy with the food expect the sushi. The waitor had to be called serveral times to get his attention. The bill took its time to come in. But overall it was a good experience, I would come here again."}
{"text":"The key thing to remember is that you're not trying the traditional version of the recipe... you're trying a 'fusion' version... so a pad thai here is nothing like a pad thai as it should be prepared.  For the most part, i prefer the original items over the fusion recipes.  Service can be rough sometimes.  Maybe you'll like the drinks, maybe you'll like one or two items on the menu, the ambiance makes you fee like you might select something interesting, but i would prefer to take my chances elsewhere than be disappointed with dish that was too sour."}
{"text":"I buy bentos takeout during happy hour for my wife a couple times and one day I noticed It advertises free pop from 3-6pm during happy hour, so I inquired about it and they said dine-in only.  Nowhere on the poster does it say that it was strictly dine in.  I wanted to call her out but I can't be bothered and since I work in the food service industry, I know that it's often not the little persons rule.  Still I hate false advertising and I'm not sure if happy hour only means dine in.  I know for me as a consumer it's not clear and they should fix this problem.   The food is good and made promptly.  I will eat in for happy hour and see if they offer me a pop and adjust my review accordingly."}
{"text":"When I lived in Toronto this was one of my fav places to go for a quick meal after work or a yummy desert date with my bf. if you come here please try the F.B.I it's so yummy I wish I could replicate this desert!"}
{"text":"Slow service as in really slow and food wasn't what I was expecting thought it would be better and more selection especially for their price"}
{"text":"Poor service. We got here at 9:40 on a Saturday night when the restaurant closes at 11pm. We wanted to do the all you can eat menu but were told right away by the server that we won't be able to do that as they cannot have all staff busy with all you can eat orders close to the closing time. Highly unprofessional. Never coming back here. Food was OK nothing special. Overpriced and everything was very 'teriyaki-ish'."}
{"text":"Was here for an Xmas dinner  The place was able to cater to our party of 20  Service was good...checked on quite frequently  Our server forgot a couple of orders but he would eventually come back and get them for us  Expected for a big party  Food was delish  Sushi and sashimi were decent Nothing knockout but good enough  The kicker was the appys and main course  Lamb was off the hook  Korean kali platter was awesome along with the bukgogi platter  Mongolian chicken was quite tasty  Loved their fried cheese dumplings  We definitely kept the kitchen busy with our AYCE orders  Will definitely come back again and recommend this for work groups doing their Xmas dinners"}
{"text":"I've been to the Spring Rolls near Yonge & Bloor, and another one near Yonge & Dundas, those seem to be ok. I mean don't expect authentic thai food, it's more like thai fusion.    I was quite excited for the Spring Rolls being opened here, so I went for their opening. I was sadly quite disappointed.  The inside interior of the restaurant is so fresh and sexy, but the food is mediocre at best. I tried their tom yum soup, which was actually the best thing I had there (minus the coriander - which I hate).  We had the mango salad (bland, have better), as well as the pad thai.  The pad thai wasn't the greatest, you can definitely get better in Toronto.    Next time you pass Spring Rolls, just walk by and go to another thai restaurant up Yonge Street."}
{"text":"On sait tous que Spring Rolls est une chaine mais j'en suis à mon 3e depuis mon arrivée au Canada et c'est l'un des plus sympa que j'ai fais!  L'ambiance générale est très agréable avec un petit bassin au milieu du restaurant!  J'ai gouté les makis, qui ne sont pas les meilleurs que j'ai mangé depuis mon arrivée mais si vous n'avez rien d'autre sous la main ca peut vraiment faire l'affaire! Car ils ne sont pas si mauvais que ca!  Le service quand a lui était normal, rien a redire mais rien d'exceptionnel non plus!"}
{"text":"This location isn't as dark and intimate as the Square One or other downtown locations but if you're hungry and going with a friend, it does the job ( maybe I just like really dark venues lol) Any location I've been too, they food has always been pretty good tasting so Spring Rolls is one of my go to places.   My fave item is their Unique Satay Pad Thai! Oh my gosh, tastes to good to me. Keep in mind, other vegetarians, their sauce is made with a shrimp base in case you don't eat any seafood/meat.   Other menu items that are great that i have tried are their actual vegetable spring rolls( they have tons of varieties) and sushi is surprisingly good too( my friend recommends their Red Dragon Roll) They have a pretty large selection on their menu that I should take advantage of every time I go but can't stay away from that Satay Pad Thai. They have a special for one person deal right now, you pick an app( option of 3), main(option of 3) and a pop for $15 ish bucks. Sounds pretty good to me! I'll prolly be visiting this location quite often because it's one long street away from me!"}
{"text":"the food here is ok, nothing really stands out but the coconut shrimp.   And my friend got stomach after having the sashimi. The salmon one was not fresh. No soup in the udon.  We were disappointed about this experience.   Not come again."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is one of those restaurants that I would visit time and time again. You get great value for the price (the size of the portions are sufficient) and the menu selection is decent. They have their busy times, but for the most part, I get seated right away even during peak hours. The servers are pretty efficient from my past experiences and food is served within my expected time. You can get a large selection of food for under $10. I had a tom yum soup that came with my main lunch dish - lettuce wrap - all for under $10. The soup was pretty large, I couldn't even finish it. Next time I go, I'll have the mango salad with curry satay chicken skewers! Too bad my stomach is too small to accommodate 3 dishes for lunch even if it was just soup and lettuce!"}
{"text":"The only thing I regularly enjoy here is the soup...  Service isn't consistent... So it depends on your luck.  Sushis are slightly oversized and look very similar in form and taste to something you can eat in a food court!  The place over do it with offers and special menus... To the point it feels a bit tacky... We once went there in late March and we had promotions on our table about valentine specials.   I once envied a featured Korean styled steak that was being served sizzling to a nearby table... Mine came in too late, over-greasy and definitely not sizzling..."}
{"text":"Dissapointing. The quality of the food and the restrictions on the \"all you can eat\" menu make this restaurant a 1 out of 5. The desserts are no longer included on the a.y.c.e menu which means you have to pay $2 extra for green tea ice cream.   Who pays for green tea ice cream! Is it just me or does this sound crazy?  To make things worse, the free 'deep friend banana with ice cream' availble on Yelp when you 'check in' has expired.  Just one more dissapointing moment I had to endure."}
{"text":"The franchise, Spring Rolls- don't get me wrong, is a great name with as usual good service. But this particular location was sitting close to the edge of the fence.   We only had a table of 8. They forced us to sit in the basement. Yes, the basement. What seemed to be a jail, the flowers and random floral wallpaper gives it a nice touch. But it will never detour our hearts when the walls are seeping with the smell of washroom sewage.   We had All-You-Can-Eat, but the maximum sit time is 2 hours. Let's just say we need at least 4 hours. Service was slow, waiters rarely came to take new orders, sushi and other small hand-food was given to the wrong people and the manager was an ass.   Personally, I do not wish coming back here. But everyone's subject to their own opinions depending on their experience. 2 stars with no remorse."}
{"text":"The all you can eat menu is a great deal   As usual the soups and pad thai are great only problem the shark in the fish tank had passed away at this location  Be prepared for the 12 rules of dining which is obnoxious  Service is good but order 6 dishes at once  They are not truly authentic but good enough your kids will be happy with their dinner"}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty good. However it's gone down hill since it first opened.  The pad thai is way too saucy.    For the price and location there are better places around.  Spring rolls has something going and now it's turned, noodle."}
{"text":"If you've ever been to PF Chang's in the US, that's what Spring Rolls is like. It's Asian food that's been modified to suit a wider palate. However, the price is right and they deliver in my 'hood, so That automatically ups its rating in my book from \"just a'ight\" to \"it's all good.\"  The dining experience is pretty good for a place as busy as this. My husband and I split the Spring Roll Platter, which was an assortment of spring rolls on top of their mango salad. The mango salad was the perfect refresher to a sticky hot day: cool and sweet with a slightly spicy kick. My General Tao's chicken (the hallmark dish of the Anglicized Chinese Food repertoire) was nicely spicy without too much heat. However, the $4.99 mojito my husband ordered tasted watered down and not very minty (the leaves were folded into the bottom of the glass and not muddled), and my soda was flat.   But the service was good, despite how busy the restaurant was. I can definitely see this place becoming a go-to for a quick meal in a stylish setting that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"i always like the atmosphere in sprinrolls. nice decor, friendly service, good decent food.   it was raining cats and dogs when i ran in here. grill salmon on top of pad thai was totally hitting the spot! hubby got some version of cantonese chow-mein. my belly was very happy on that particular gloomy rainy evening. :)  the patron sitting behind me sounded like rose from two and a half men - hilarious! I had some entertainment with my dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice over the past year, the most recent being last night for a school networking event. Like others have mentioned, choose Spring Rolls for the ambiance (sit down, formal relative to the countless fast food joints in this area), not for the food. Considering its super convenient location next to the Eaton Centre and part of the PATH at the very north end (financial district workers- you guys can come here from your offices without traveling outside at all), I wasn't expecting the food to be out-of-this-world good. And that's pretty much how it was last night.   Food- 2/5. Not that great. I ordered the Tom Yum Soup (app), Thai Basil Spicy Eggplant (main), and fried banana + brownie bites (dessert). Never order the Tom Yum Soup - it tasted pretty flavorful actually, but I wonder how much of that flavor (especially the sweetness and umami) was actually natural. The presentation was horrible - looked like someone splashed in it first with tomato sauce caked all around the bowl rim and big oil blobs covering the surface. There were very few pieces of cherry tomatoes and tiny pieces of chicken. The Thai Basil Spicy Eggplant was not bad! Also very oily, but the eggplant was cooked just right imo - not too mushy, not too crunchy. Also contained many large pieces of skinless, boneless chicken. The entire dish is NOT spicy btw unless you choose to munch on the peppers. The milkshakes here apparently tasted like real fruit, which is a great start, but not as creamy/milky as say, a mango lassi.   Value- Since I didn't pay last night I can only comment from my 1st time experience here. Overpriced? Probably, given the below average portion sizes for apps and mains (you won't be boxing anything for the next meal), but not outrageous. Take your hard earned $$ to Salad King or Asian Bowl (both nearby and count as Asian fusion) for bigger portions, better value, and a louder/less classy experience.  Service- 3/5. Superrrrr slow for food to come, both times that I was here. All the servers were friendly and helpful though  Venue- 4/5. Pretty classy for this chaotic, touristy area. Can get loud especially when the restaurant fills up at dinnertime as customers sit so close together. They have a downstairs and upstairs with upstairs being generally louder, but at least they have natural lighting and a street view. Good place for a more formal event (i.e. business lunch).  Overall, will not be back intentionally, but not opposed to grabbing a quick dinner here another day."}
{"text":"Got takeout.  Horrible experience.  Food came 2 hrs after we ordered even though we were in the dt core.  Sushi was warm.  Pineapple rice did not come with pineapple skin as advertised on the menu. Very disappointing. Would recommend pizza over spring rolls takeout anyday"}
{"text":"Whaaat? Where's the love here? My mom and I LOVED this place - we came here for dinner 2 nights in a row. First night, we had the Korean Kalbi ribs and the seafood platter and the ribs came SIZZLING like one of those cheesy commercials and the seafood was perfectly deep fried. The place was clean and our server (we had 2 nights in a row thankfully) was AMAZING! We were so impressed, we came back the next night to try their all you can eat and tried a bit of everything - it was great! Nice comfy booths at the front if you can get them, modern decor, quick food, friendly service, reasonable prices. I have nothing more to ask! I'll update this review with the servers name when I dig for my receipt."}
{"text":"Their All You Can eat menu is one of my favs... its Huge... & their appetizers & desserts are yummy... I also like their upscaled setting & decor... I go there at least twice a month"}
{"text":"I came here for a school reunion with a guest list of 12 people.  Upon arriving we only had four people and the host told us that we were not allowed to sit at our table until at least half of our party has arrived.  The waiting area is very small and cramped so we decided to wait outside.  This is not my first time at a spring rolls, I have been to a spring rolls the first time it opened in Toronto but I didn't have a great experience but maybe things have changed.  Going through the menu I realized they have a variety of Vietnamese Thai and Japanese food.   Not quite sure if this is a good or bad thing.  I ended up ordering the famous pad Thai with chicken.   It was hard to judge whether it took longer than usual for the food to come because of our large party size, but the food arrived a bit longer than i would have expected.    The waiter also kept on forgetting our drinks.  When my pad Thai arrived I noticed off the bat that the color was not authentic.   The chicken didn't have much flavor and I felt like everything tasted like ketchup.   Though I finished the whole plate because I was hungry but I really wasn't sure what I was eating.  The environment is set up kind of weirdly. There are weird open spaces and this weird light decoration in the middle.  The acoustics are designed poorly because it was really loud in there and hard to talk to even the person next to me.  I don't think I will be coming back here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is a great place to get Thai food but the menu at this restaurant is a really a fusion of Asian cuisine,   The house pad Thai here is really good - lots of tofu, egg, roasted peanuts, bean sprouts and coriander and loaded with chicken and shrimp.   However, if you're looking for a healthier (and more exciting meal) I love the salad wraps. It's stir-fried pieces of chicken and veggies in a oyster-type sauce. Then you wrap them up in big leaves of iceberg lettuce. The sweet and the crunch are really something else and you won't feel so full afterwards. Also, the sexy summer salad rolls are filled with smoked salmon, lettuce mushrooms and vermicelli noodles are are must!   There are so many great dishes to try here and so far I have been very impressed with everything I've tried!"}
{"text":"If they asked me what restaurant disappointed me the most in Canada,  no other place can come to mind before this.   I have been to yonge and bloor location hundreds of times and always loved it,  ordered take out many times from the old location on Front street and never disappoint but this location.... Oh boy.  The main disaster was the waiter.  From the second I walked in and he is dropping attitude like I walked in to their own living room.   It was Saturday Jan 16 2016 and I decided to meet my friend for an early dinner. The spring rolls were not defrosted yet.  It's hot outside and freezing inside making zero taste and texture.  Pic attached.  The main course I ordered comes with A soup or salad the never mentioned that so when I asked he said which one you want \"with attitude\"  I said salad.  He brought me what's in the pic.  A disgusting mix of greens with seaweeds and two different dressings on it.  I swear it was as if he put whatever 2 left over plates together and gave it to me.   I don't care what the waiters problem was,  but this attitude with poor food and downtown prices isn't working.  It's pure crap.   You want to dress the place like a fine dining restaurant then don't serve food court food and hire professional waiters.... I highly do not recommend going there unless you feel like picking a fight."}
{"text":"When six people go for lunch and all agree that the quality of the food has gone down hill to the point you would not go back if it were free, you know its bad."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, for a chain Thai restaurant I thought the food was pretty good here. I much more enjoyed my dinner mate's food than I did mine LOL. I got the Pad Thai which was okay, but just not the style I like Pad Tahi cooked, he got a sort of beef and vegetable which was delicious.  The spring rolls were different, a very strong taste rather than a light fresh taste that I am used to. I definitely would try this place again, they have some other things on the menu that I would like to try."}
{"text":"I was apprehensive about going to a place that was part of a chain, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I thought it was a thai place, but they serve a wide range of food.  I picked the surf and turf option (korean short ribs/kalbi and shrimp).  I was impressed.  It was perfectly cooked and just the right serving size.  There was just the right amount of sauce so the rice wasn't soaked.  I have yet to make my way through the rest of their menu.  I was very curious to check out what everyone had on their plates."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this restaurant randomly after sitting at a table in Joeys for 15 minutes and were ignored by our server.  We were seated quickly and the waiter brought us water right off the bat, which I love! All of the servers were friendly and the food was pretty quick and always fresh. I had the best California Rolls in the world here! mm! All of the facilities were clean and everything was well organized. We had the all you can eat lunch. A little pricey but so worth it.    I have no real complaints about this place what so all. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I used to work at a hotel that served frozen from the box food and made it look high quality with different types of garnishes. I was shocked when I was being served the same type of frozen from the box food at Spring Rolls. Karma? Dinner cost was $60 for me and my girlfriend. Hungry Man or TV dinner is $6-$10"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday party recently. We decided to get the buffet special and it was fantastic!  The selection of food is great, as there is nice variety of different Asian meals like Sushi, Chinese, and Korean. I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere of the place. The food has a great taste, well seasoned, cooked just right, and brought out in an expedient manner.   I have been here several times and there is defiantly a nice wide variety of items on the menu."}
{"text":"Really nice place to have a dinner, the environment is really good, also the service. However, as a ayce sushi restaurant, for the unagi sushi, literally there's no unagi on the top. But overall, the rest food is very good. High recommend for famous pad Thai."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is what it is. Not the most authentic Thai food around, but I've usually been satisfied with my meals. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is pleasant as well. It's also worth nothing that this part of the city has a serious lack of good food. I enjoy the Thai Red Curry and the Sexy Summer Salad Rolls."}
{"text":"Different than some of the other locations, for lunch they have a number of specials or the AYCE options the one downside was the sushi chef going on his break during the lunch I was there for, they warned you so you could order first but still if you wanted something else you were out of luck. The food options were tasty, I liked the tempura, the rolls were all good (however the spicy mayo on the dynamite roll was missing in action) overall a solid choice, with nice service but at 35 for a sake and lunch deal plus tip it's got to be more than solid to be both value and quality."}
{"text":"Dumplings so-so. General Tao chicken very bland - tastes a lot like $5 Chinese at the mall. Drinks are fairly cheap. Not impressed. At least we got free ice cream!"}
{"text":"Feeling fat and trying to diet and exercise to fit into an extremely expensive bridesmaid's dress, I planned on skipping dinner altogether (yes, bad, I know!) but my fiance had nothing to eat at home (double bad on my part) so we headed over to Springrolls again, 9:30PM-ish.  Wanting something light, I ordered the vegetarian Tom Yum Goong for $4.99 (for $0.60 more you can get shrimp) and started with the Sexy Summer Salad rolls ($5.99)...only because they're the only rolls that use rice paper wrap, not the wheat kind.  And once again, I was blown away. My mouth is watering just thinking about the soup. I've never been big on Thai soups but this had just the right amount of sour and savoury flavours and lots of veggies.   The salad rolls are amazing. veggies and smoked salmon with shrimp all served on this sweet jam-like sauce with a side of sweet dip sauce (no clue what it's called!).  I'm even thinking of heading over there right now to get my fix again.  It was an awesome meal, and very low in carbs (if you care for that kinda thing)."}
{"text":"different from 2 years back...  have changed their buffet menu.. the server didnt have much suggestions for vegetarian and I wouldn't recommend vegetarian(especially like me) to eat here as I was looking for more flavors. Loved their mango ice cream though..   would I recommend it to people? May be will I visit again? May be not"}
{"text":"This place used to be my absolute FAVOURITE restaurant. We used to come here at least once a week about two years ago. We used to only come for lunch, since their lunch buffet had a lot more goodies than dinner.  I then went back about a year later, and the food was terrible! There was way too much rice, and they had a lot of unconventional menu items that just did NOT pair well together.   Today was the first time I've been there since then, and the quality has improved. slightly. I admit they have things on the menu you wouldn't expect to be on an asian menu. Like cease salad, prosciutto wrapped melon, to name a few. The miso soup, sashimi, and hand roll we got tasted very fresh. I would say about a third of the things on the menu do NOT belong on there. Another third are cooked dishes, like fried rice and noodles. the last third (not even) is made up of sushi. I wouldn't recommend anything besides sushi. The rack of lamb we got was carelessly overcooked and dry, as were the chicken wings.  The best part of the menu is definitely the DESSERT MENU. I tried almost everything, and the mousse is delicious!! They have the tango mango mousse that I highly recommend.   The price is VERY high. It was $27 per person for weekend dinner. The food, though decently good, is definitely NOT worth the price. You'd be better off finding another place with better food and cheaper prices."}
{"text":"We have gone there numerous times and always enjoyed it. The last time we atet here was 2-3 months ago. We went today and ordered the exact same dishes and the food was horrible. The Pad Thai was super sweet, like a sweet and sour sauce soup. The chicken had some weird after taste to it and the curry dish was very bland. I am not sure if they got new chefs or just lowered their standards. Taking this place of my list."}
{"text":"The not so bad stuff: 1. Variety - I tried 3 things and none of them were good - but you still have over 30 different things 2. Ambience - That's one thing they are really good at 3. Price - It's pretty cheap for a restaurant like that 4. Leechi Sake - That was the saving grace of the day :)  The bad stuff: 1. Food - None of the stuff we tried was any good - I know it's subjective, but none of us liked the food 2. Do I need anything else to add if the food is not good?"}
{"text":"Poor quality, over priced. Too much of a mish mash of menu items. Their Thai food tastes like Chinese food. Sushi quality is horrible. Service is non - existent - too much attitude from the servers. Not a bright idea to have Chinese, Thai & Japanese food offered on 1 menu. How do you know which sells more and has better quality & freshness when ordering? When they had 1 or 2 restaurants the food quality was much better and the service was great, it has gone downhill. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"WHY DOES ANYONE GO HERE???  seriously, this may be the worst thai food i have ever had. especially the pad thai-- can someone please pass the note on to the chef that there is no ketchup in pad thai??  prices are outrageous and the people are pretty rude. my in-laws were in town and got takeout from here to bring to their hotel room. they called us in shock asking if this was how it usually tasted. we told them unfortunately, yes, and they had to throw it out.  this place is not authentic, it's not a fun experience, and it's not cheap. don't waste your time or your appetite."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. I was completely put off by the service at Spring Rolls. I went on Tuesday night for dinner with my sister and dad. My sister and I wanted all you can eat (I heard good things about it), my dad did not. We were informed the entire party had to decide on one or the other. Okay, fair. We convinced my dad to do all you can eat. You are allowed to order 5 pieces of sashimi per order. I ordered sashimi, soup, beef and noodles, seaweed salad, and salmon sushi for our first order. The server said that was probably good for our first order and promptly left without asking for drink orders. I was so thirsty. She returned with the beef and noodles and miso soup (which was under-salted and cold) after a brief wait and then took our drink orders and left before I could order more food. We finished the food and were just sitting there looking for her. She came by with a measly portion of sushi and the five pieces of sashimi, too little for three people, and I asked her where my seaweed salad was, she said it would be out soon. We quickly finished that and were again left waiting.  We tried to call the waitress over probably three times but were never able to get her attention, even when we called her from the table next to us, she turned around and went the other way. Our drinks and stomachs were left empty. When she came back to take our second round of ordering, I again asked for sashimi, salmon sushi, and asked her if the seaweed salad was coming to which she replied it was not ready yet. Instead of bringing salmon sushi like I had requested, she brought a green dragon roll and said sorry (she knew it was not what we ordered). I do not even like green dragon rolls but we were so hungry by this time we ate it all anyways. We were never brought the salmon sushi we ordered. When I asked for my seaweed salad the third time she brought it and it tasted like acetone. Disgusting. I had to spit it out.  The service took so long that we didn't even bother ordering anymore. After two hours I just wanted to leave. My dad had to YELL to get the waitress' attention. We finally paid our bill and left.  An overall displeasing experience."}
{"text":"Springrolls is a Thai restaurant that is pricier than the nearby Salad King, but it still seems to do well for itself.  Inside, the restaurant is somewhat fancy.  They've spent some money on interior decoration, and unlike Salad King, you're not cramped into your seat.    The food itself is pretty good.  Not amazing, and certainly nothing you'll ever find yourself having a craving for, but it's still good.  In all honesty, the best thing about this place has to be the relaxed environment.  Again, I'm comparing this to Salad King, but I feel it's an important comparison.  You never feel rushed in here.  It's not a bustling, loud environment, in the good way."}
{"text":"I've dined here on several occasions both for dinner and lunch - a la carte and AYCE.   Modern chic atmosphere, clean facilities.  Friendly service and attentive staff.  Extensive menu, generous portions and medium price point.  The seafood platter is delish -  fried calamari, tempura shrimp, coconut shrimp served on a bed of mango salad.  The Springrolls appetizer platter is a tasty collection of assorted fresh and fried rolls. Loved the Tom Yum soup but be warned -  it's spicy!  The tango mango chicken was a hit as was the tempura cheesecake.  And to top it off, both their white and red Sangria are delish.  The kids love this place and so do the adults - would recommend!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today. Service was below average, and the food was acceptable.  I think with Spring Rolls it's an expectation thing. Don't have any.  Just kidding! Just don't expect anything more than a chain restaurant for food or service, and then you shouldn't be disappointed.  I won't categorize Spring Rolls as a Thai restaurant. Spring Rolls is more of a generic Asian restaurant, a step up from mall take-out food, in my humble opinion.  Had a lunch special. Soup, which was pretty spicy but very oily and an entree with a salad, chicken dumplings, some sweet and sour chicken, and pad thai. Except for the consistency, I couldn't tell the flavor of the sweet and sour from the pad thai. Don't you think that's a problem? I am giving it a 3 because nothing was bad, it just wasn't that good either."}
{"text":"Fine if you don't notice the food.  Big, bright, contemporary, with different levels and textures, this is where you go with a bunch of friends to talk and have a beverage, knowing that you will be too preoccupied to notice the food.   I stopped in for lunch, and comparing prices, noted that the AYCE would be a better value. I started with the coconut shrimp, great coconut flavor, but tough and overcooked.  I saturated them in the sweet chili sauce to balance it out.   Siu Mai tasted like the frozen, store bought stuff. For sushi, I ordered a salmon hand roll which was soggy and a bit heavy on the rice.  A hand roll must have snappy crisp nori, or it is so unenjoyable. The Rainbow Roll was very heavy on avocado, and slightly light on the fish.   I also tried the Tango Mango Chicken, which had good flavor, but the chicken was also tough.  The beef fried rice was ok, and had several surprisingly large pieces of beef. I dipped the beef in the mango sauce.   Add an iced tea, and I'm at $21 before tip. For $4 less, Chitose smokes Spring Rolls.  I don't know what is nearby that would compare, but I can't believe that this is the best Asian food in Brampton.  There are many other better choices for food, so come for the conversation and the surroundings, but eat first."}
{"text":"Another quick lunch, and I did not want any of the classic \"road food\".  I stopped in during lunch hour and was quickly seated upstairs.  The layout of the restaurant is more interesting than most, with glass partitions, staircases and a finish worthy of a higher end dining establishment.  I ordered the Sauteed Sechuan Sauce Seafood.  The sauce was nicely spices, not quite as authoritative as a true sechuan dish, by tempered to a wider audience without destroying the spirit of the dish.  The seafood was also nicely done.  I find you can often judge a restaurant by the seafood, since it is so easy to ruin.  The server was experiencing her first day on the job, so there were some hiccups, but the other servers ensured that I was not disappointed.  Unlike P.F. Chang, which is a bit pretentious, Spring Rolls is more authentic, more fun, and more economical.  There is a pin in my GPS making Spring Rolls another preferred waypoint when I'm in the big city."}
{"text":"Anglicized Chinese Food.  It looks somewhat authentic, but it's a far cry from Richmond Hill.  I started with a bowl of Hong Kong Style Wonton Soup. Small and watery, for the same $5.50 I can get a massive Shrimp Wonton Noodle Soup at Richmond Court in Times Square, Richmond Hill.  For the main, I had the Stir Fried Seafood.  It was stirred.  It was fried. It had some seafood.  Not much seafood.  Not much flavour.  The price was pretty spendy, though.  This is probably a great place if you have a sensitive stomach that reacts to anything above bland.  The food is fresh, looks pretty appealing, but without flavour, I'm not their target customer."}
{"text":"their food pretty much sucks.   it was a big disappointment my first time trying it out. their sushi is horrible... there is nothing that sticks out, nothing that's really better than anything else..  i've eaten at a looot of asian restaurants, and this one just blows. some of the things were frozen and heated up.. service was terrible. it wasn't even busy and i had to wait so long for one of the two waitresses to see my hand.  never eating here again"}
{"text":"Food is not as good as the Mississauga branch very disappointed , shrimp coconut too salty and pha Thai its with ketchup ."}
{"text":"The service is poor and the tissue that they offered us is dirty. The food quality is ok. But expected more for this price"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this location in our quest to try all the Spring Rolls in Toronto. We came around 5pm on a Sunday, so there were not a lot of people. I ordered the Thai Basil Spicy Eggplant with Beef and he ordered the Thai Green Curry with Tofu. Our food took approximately 7 minutes and 23 seconds to arrive between the time we ordered and the time the food was brought to our table.   I quite enjoyed the eggplant, the flavoring of the sauce was adequate and it was not too spicy. I only wish I had more rice to soak up the excess sauce. However, there were a couple of fruit flies (or black dots that fly) that hovered over my plate up. Those two fruit flies did not leave until I finished the food. Perhaps they were also in love with the eggplant, but that was a downer.   Unlike other Spring Rolls, Thai Green Curry did not come in its own bowl, it was served on the same plate with the rice. Some people like my boyfriend will frown upon such plating. There were ample of bok-choy, but not enough tofu.   The presentation of the food is definitely much better than other 5 Spring Rolls locations in Toronto. From our experience, the wait time for the food to arrive is average, with the Sheppard Spring Rolls being the fastest. Female washrooms are decent, there's soap, paper towel, I don't need to use my hands to open any doors after washing. If you are paying by credit card, the cardholder's name will appear on the receipt."}
{"text":"If you see a deal on the menu and you want to order takeout, call them first. I saw a deal on the \"specials\" menu. When I called them to pre-order, they told me that it was for dine-in only. It didn't specify that on the menu. Anyhow, they lost my business and it's not like they are at full capacity. If I went there to dine in, what's the difference? Would they make me buy a few drinks or pay gratuity?  Once in a while, it's ok to make the customer happy. Especially when you can't really explain why I can't order what it says on the menu."}
{"text":"To be honest I had low expectations before visiting Spring Rolls as I had read a few reviews here on Yelp that almost strayed me away however I had never been here before and thought I should give them the benefit of the doubt. It was fairly quiet when me and my friend arrived and we politely asked the hostesses the question they probably hear a billion times a day \"can we get a booth?\" . Due to it being so dead they were kind enough to seat us at a 2 seater booth by the entrance where they seat all \"a la carte\" guests it seemed. We quickly dug through the menu and figured out what to get. I had originally wanted Chicken chow mein but with cantonese noodles but then the classic \"Chicken Fried Rice\" caught my attention.   Our Waitress throughout the night was very attentive, getting our drink orders first as well as our order with my no onion substitution and I would say it took less than 10 minutes for our order to arrive - Just Perfect, considering we were starving from shopping. My chicken fried rice was a healthy platter portion, the chicken wasn't the rubber kind and tasted great although I do wish there was a little bit more of it. Presentation was nice as well as it came platted on a banana leaf I believe. As we stayed the restaurant began to fill up and I noticed a lot of staff, management and hostesses running around to make sure everyone was attended too.   Once we finished our meal we decided to get both the street brownies and mango creme brulee for my friend. The street brownie and blondies were nothing too spectacular, the brownie tasted like regular two bite brownies while the chocolate chip brownies tasted a little dry and stale..almost like a dry brownie. I am not sure if they were meant to taste that way however it didn't blow me away. I took a spoonful of the mango creme brulee off my friends ramekin and it was nice and creamy once you got past that hard sugar that comes with all creme brulees.   The only disappointment to my trip was that I got asked if I wanted a refill after I had finished all my food and the dessert options could have been a little better.   I will definitely come back but I won't be running back. There are better options around the city for chicken fried rice, however I would give this place a shot again if need be."}
{"text":"Yeah, you can say that Spring Rolls is an over-rated franchise. But from time-to-time (perhaps a long time, actually), I do venture in to try.  With that said, if you're looking for authentic thai food, please avoid this place. They try to pull an Asian Fusion type of dishes, where most are a miss, rather than a hit.   I had the summer prix-fixe menu and ordered the mango/shrimp spring roll, pepper-corn steak with fried rice, and mango creme brulee. My guest had the pad thai.  The pad thai had gone down in portion size. It was truly lacking in flavour and had too many veggies to fill the size. (It was a chicken pad thai).  The mango/shrimp spring roll is served cold, and was quite refreshing on a hot day. The mango was sour though. The steak was actually done pretty well for that price, but it felt weird eating with fried rice. The creme brulee was average and forgettable.  The service was very friendly, fun, and attentive though, looking past the food. I had 5 servers say bye to me on my way out.  I don't think I would be back for a long time."}
{"text":"This location is just average n the 2 stars is really generous. Much better quality at dundas location."}
{"text":"Salt n pepper calamari was good. Cold staff."}
{"text":"Being around Eaton Center and hungry, my boyfriend and I decided to go to eat here since it was convenient and looked really nice inside. I'm really happy we chose this place to eat then eating at pickle barrel. We were seated immediately and the staff were really nice. As seen from the outside, the inside has a really clean environment and modern style, perfect for a casual dinner date!  We got the 3 course meal ($20) and the bulgogi (~$13). We weren't too sure how big the portions we but we were pleasantly surprised! We were both very full at the end and could barely finish the last bits of our food (reminder, we came on an empty stomach!). The food is definitely an Asian fusion style, which I actually really enjoyed. The bulgogi came with 3 side dishes, edamame and a bowl of rice. The wait time for the food was longer than expected though (~25mins) despite it not being a full house.  Being in a very tourist-y area, I thought the restaurant would be extremely expensive (since it is also nice looking on the inside too)! But $36 including tips for two people dinner was great. Would come again if it's the closest around and feeling non-adventurous.  Tl;dr satisfying, non-expensive Asian fusion food but long wait to get food"}
{"text":"Very good food with excellent service my first time here and won't be my last. Korean barbecue are out of this world for the price!!   Nancy our fabulous waitress was very sweet and kind. Fried rice was good too."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls has been around at this location for almost ever as far as I can remember...The decos are contemp and seating is quite comfortable..both times I checked in here was for the weekend brunch...which starts I think at 1130-12. For 18.99 per head, its an acceptable price but the choices of food were limited and they came in such small portions, you would just keep ordering...  I guess being Chinese has its perks because I've already more of less tried all the items on the menu at different restaurants so the menu wasn't especially appealing to me per say...  I can't say they were authentic in any way, shape or form for Thai/Chinese/Viet/Japanese. The food just tasted very sweet on most terms for me...I ordered more sushi and sashimi in comparison to the other foods available on the menu...  Tom Yum soup and Wonton Soup just felt like it was from a prepackaged mixing with luke warm water..(ewww...) not even boiling water...epic fail!  The service was an A-OK, we were checked upon quite frequently by our server and refills of water....drinks are not included in this price, so if you want any alcohol or soft drinks..it's all extra money...  All in all, not a place I'm desperate to come back since the food wasn't great..."}
{"text":"Let's go with the good things first:  Convenient location (though parking is hard come by), seating is comfortable, service is friendly, food comes fairly quickly, prices are reasonable, menu selection is extensive.   Now the not-so-impressive things: Food looks good but isn't too tasty, and it's true almost across the board.   We went for the all-you-can-eat buffet (in which you can order from anything on their buffet menu). We tried the sushi, the chinese (both dim sum/appetizers, soup, hot dishes), but they are all quite underwhelming. (I would definitely not order the hot-and-sour soup or fried tofu, if I ever visit again.)   But, if you have some hungry mouths to feed (eg. teenage boys) who are not picky about food or care how tasty it is, this can be a decent choice (given the reasonable pricing for the all-you-can-eat lunch buffet). Other than that, I wouldn't visit again for their regular menu."}
{"text":"Went there recently with our friends after some time at the park. So, 4 adults 2 smalls kids, and 2 baby in strollers.    First - the place is definitely not kid friendly. No kids menu, and barely anywhere to park your stroller.  If you have a baby, definitely not the place.  Decor is nice.  I seem to always order some kind of noodle dish.The first couple times I been to Spring Rolls I thought it was pretty good.  But I started to feel the food has become very bland.   Our server was nice, but the kitchen flat out lied.  So my friend was eating her food, a noodle dish I believe. And upon biting, she found a small piece, that looked like a piece of plastic/glass. Upon putting in her hand to inspect, it fell out. So obviously couldn't say anything. Toward end of the meal, as she was finishing the mango salad, she found the piece on the seat.  She mentioned to the server, but said it was found in the salad. Server came back and said it was some type of sugar they put in the salad. LOL. I don't know the type of sugar they mentioned, but would love to see what it look like. Because let me tell you, that is one big piece of sugar, that looks like plastic/glass.    In middle of our meal, gf and I remember we were actually there sometime last year.  Did not plan on going back, but totally forgot.  Nevertheless, no plans on returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Went here for Friday dinner.  Had the AYCE menu ($30/adults and 1/2 price for kids)  Service rating 5/5. Food overall rating 1/5.  There were a lot of inconsistencies.  As simple as the eggplant dish with tofu, which I had 2 helpings. The first order was seasoned but the second was definitely not.  All the food was overly oily.  Not sure what was going on, I felt like they poured a bucket of oil into every dish that came off of the wok! The fried rice, the pad thai, the bok choy, salmon, green curry...etc.  Not good for a restaurant that is trying to distinguish itself from other take-out Chinese places.   The mango salad needs to be dressed.  You can't call it salad just by slicing strips of mangos onto a plate.   Restaurant décor rating 3/5. Washroom rating 0/5.  There was 2 stalls in comparison to the capacity of the restaurant which does not make any sense.  For a small washroom, there HAS to be continuous maintenance."}
{"text":"Of all the places to have lunch, why do people continue to come here? The food is beyond mediocre, it is downright tasteless. Every time I've ordered the Pad Thai it has been disappointing so that is why I decided to avoid it this time. Instead, I had some beef & shrimp and the only thing that had flavour was the sauce. Neither the beef or shrimp had any taste to it.  Somehow this place continues to be packed at lunch time which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. There are plenty of Asian restaurants west of Bay &amp; Dundas. Although they might not be that amazing, they are certainly way better then anything served at Spring Rolls."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is phenomenal. Get the expanded menu so you can try their high end rolls and desserts. For an AYCE place, everything was plated nicely and they had expensive lobster and sashimis on their expanded menu. Their cupcakes are to die for. I go here regularly to graze like a cow and am never disappointed."}
{"text":"Took my group here for a couple of birthdays this past week.  I tried the curry pad-thai and it was okay... I've had better, but it was okay... the Tom Yong Goon soup (I probably bastardized the spelling LOL) and it is pretty good (I tend to get this soup when I go to a Spring Rolls)... the actual Spring Rolls are my favorite and I order it usually as an appetizer... As far as chains go it's not a bad place..."}
{"text":"Each time I come here I can feel the quality getting worse and worse. I mainly just come here for the AYCE appetizers, that's where it's at. The tempura basket, sweet potato fries and mango salad are must haves; but honestly all of their appetizers are amazing. The main courses are honestly nothing special, I'd even say they're below average. You'd be better off going to a food court and getting something from manchu wok or another chinese fast food chain. The sushi is also pretty boring, nothing special.   PSA: if you're the kind of person that can't always finish your food, don't get the AYCE menu. They charge like $3 for every dish you don't finish which is pretty ridiculous if you ask me. If the food really was that great then the customer would finish all of it with no leftovers. Why should you be forced to finish food you don't like? And what's the point of charging $3? Whether the food ends up in a stomach or in the trash, what's the difference? It seems like a dirty trick for them to get extra money...   Also last time I was here my waiter mixed up some of our orders and then at the end pressured us into giving a tip. One of my friends tried to drop a hint that she didn't want to by saying she didn't have change -- to which he responded \"I can make change.\" .... awkward Last I checked, tips are supposed to be OPTIONAL. Only if you really liked the food and the service -- which we didn't so why would we tip? Tell that to the waiter named Joe lol"}
{"text":"My least favorite location. Too bad I could not give zero stars to this \"restaurant.\" The service was bad and the waiter was ignorant, almost rude, with an attitude. We were couple of people and two of us chose to take \"all you can eat\", but I was not so hungry, so I just wanted to order one small dish. Our waiter said that I also have to take \"all you can eat\" What??!! Really? Are you kidding!? His attitude was very ignorant and almost rude. At the end he said that I have to sit at another table! What? Well, OK. My friends were sitting at the table next to me, I sat next to them at different table. Won't be coming here again! The waiter brought me water with a fly inside. Really? That's just crazy. I called the water and showed him the fly, but he did not care. He did not apologize, just went to bring me new water without saying a word. No customer service. All his attitude was like \"I don't care, be fast\". I ordered a salad that was so stingy and small, and it wasn't even an appetizer! Definitely one of the worst experiences! Their waiters have to be trained or fired!"}
{"text":"I used to like Spring Rolls waaaaay back in the day.  They had a lot of good dishes that were Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese for a decent price.  The portions are pretty big as well.  I don't know what has happened, maybe I have experienced much better due to the explosion of really good Asian food in the past 10 years that this place leaves me...meh.    There are now many locations and I think with this the quality of food has gone down.  Just generic dishes now.   I remember once I went on a Sunday morning as they had dim sum and it was the worst dim sum I have ever had and it was pretty pricey.  I may visit it again if need be, but I certainly won't be on my list of go to places."}
{"text":"I love spring rolls pad thia i think its amazing, BUT, if your going to order take out from spring rolls order from the express spring rolls next door. Its much cheaper and you get the exact same portion as you would in the sit down restaurant. Its a rip off. also, the spring rolls express takes debit and the restaurant doesn't.   I made the mistake of ordering from the restaurant (because i called the number on the website DONT DO THAT) and not only did i pay more for my meal but i had to go across the street and use an ATM because i couldnt get to my bank since i was on lunch break. I normally go into the express place and order there but i wanted to call in advance. I guess thats what i get for not wanting to wait in line.   Advice: your better off going into the express for the same food youd get in the restaurant because its cheaper and more efficient. :)"}
{"text":"We tend to order delivery from spring rolls 2 to 3 times a week, that will NEVER happen again. From the one and a half hour wait time when they're literally across the street from us... too the one third of the pad thai missing per container today,  this location has finally pushed me too far. And their excuse to customer service was it's a measured amount, when your loyal customers purchase generally the same items 2-3 times a week they know when you half assed their meal and tried to rip them off.  Never again. If I could give zero stars I would as this is unacceptable. You're better off going in, because being incompetent is harder to do to people's faces for this location."}
{"text":"I didn't expect amazing Pad Thai from here at all, but I didn't expect it to be as bad as it was.  I got the Chicken Pad Thai, it was a pretty big portion but not worth $12.99+tax and tip. It tasted like really sweet ketchup with overcooked chicken; not like Pad Thai should taste at all. Not even hot sauce was able to save it. I took two bites and had to stop.  I had two pieces of my friend's dragon roll and it was decent.  To be fair, my review may be skewed because of the awful server we had. He wasn't very nice at all and didn't he want to help us. It wasn't busy at all when we went, and we didn't even ask for much: water, food, hot sauce, and our bills. If tipping wasn't absolutely necessary in North America he wouldn't have gotten any tips from me. I won't be back here."}
{"text":"I am such a huge fan of Spring Rolls...I really don't know what it is. Maybe it's the seafood fried rice. Maybe it's the tornado rolls...maybe it's the mouth watering summer rolls. I DON\"T KNOW BUT I WANT TO LIVE IN IT!!!! The restaurant, not the summer roll.  So first of all, since I'm cheap, the prices are great. I have never paid more than $20 for an entree and appetizer here.   They also have an AYCE menu. When I found this out, I almost jumped out of my pants. Good thing I didn't, I hear no pants no service? Anyway, the AYCE menu is amazing because, surprisingly, they have GOOD sushi with very little rice and a lot of stuff. They have sashimi, for some reason the menu says that you can only order 5 pieces per person but I always order more and that seems to be on with the staff. They have a lot of wok options, the servings aren't that big so you can try everything!!! Don't miss out on AYCE at Spring Rolls!!!! Tornado rolls are those shrimps wrapped in a batter that looks like a tornado. It's hard to describe but trust me, iz gooood. And sexy summer rolls are the non-fried ones - they have avocado, lettuce, crab or shrimp, other greenery and come wrapped in a see through rice paper. yummmmzeeerrrzzzzz  The staff at the Sheppard and Yonge location are super nice. Last time I went we had a n00b, it was his first day, and he was aaaadorable! So nice and so helpful and just a tad shy - everything you want in a server.   The food is fresh and it comes quick. There are two options for the AYCE menu, you can get the regular or the premium. Premium comes with some delicious options and it's only $3 more - GET IT! Don't be shy.  AYCE brunch goes from 11-3pm, AYCE dinner is 3-10pm."}
{"text":"I like the food but the service/kitchen is so slow. I have been sitting waiting for anything to come for the last 30 minutes.. Not even the soup has arrived ..."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place for a quick lunch if you are in the area.    The pros: They spend a lot of energy on presentation.  Everything looks fancy and is presented on nice dishes with embellishments.  They Spicy Thai Noodle was delicious.  The thick noodles were perfectly cooked and not chewy or took thick at all.  The sauce was not really spicy, but had a yummy basil flavor.  Tofu was deep fried perfectly, just like I like it.  I also was curious about the all you can eat menu for $15.  They had a huge selection on that menu, and if I was hungrier I would have gone for it.  They had a nice patio to sit outside as well.    The cons: The place's name sake dish (the spring rolls) were pretty much awful.  Cold, not crispy, no flavor. I LOVE spring rolls, so it is always disappointing when my go to dish is a let down.  Also...i'd prefer to get 4 to split between 2 people instead of 3 (if they are good of course).    So in the end, it seems like a hit and miss type of place, which may make the all you can eat menu the way to go to try out several items."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of Thai food,but I liked this place. We tried tempura shrimps, tom yum and black pearl rolls. The soup was a bit spicy, but everything else was good. I honestly didn't like the service, but we came on Saturday night and they were quite busy. I might give the place another shot some time."}
{"text":"Great food! The Tom yum soup and seafood platter are so far my favourites, but everything else tastes and looked great as well. Heads down for the size of their rolls- those are huge!  The service was very fast keeping in mind in was a Friday night and we all were coming straight from work, so we were super hungry :) our server was very knowledgable and recommended us a few menu items I probably wouldn't think of myself. I'll definitely stop by for lunch/dinner when I'm in that area."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time because the food is good, the people are nice, and the location is convenient for me.  All of the Spring Rolls standards are good here: Singapore vermicelli, fried rice with shrimp and BBQ pork, Mongolian beef, beef in black pepper sauce, Kung Pao chicken, Korean Kalbi ribs, and many other choices, all very delicious.  They used to have a huge menu, but they've recently changed it and deleted some items. There are no pictures any more, so the menu doesn't look nearly as sexy as it did before.  Most of the best choices are still on the new menu, though.  One of my big criticisms would be that they tend to use too much onion, maybe as a filler to bulk up the dish and save use of other ingredients. But I just pick out the onions and it tastes great. I would  recommend to choose the Chinese dishes instead of the sushi here, because it's not their specialty.  Overall I really like this location. They do take-out and delivery as well, which is great for people who live in the area."}
{"text":"Was walking by and decided to stop for a spring roll and Wonton Soup. They were both delicious. I had to wait a bit but that's because your food is made fresh and they had freshly made Sushi 50% off.  The cashier was polite and yes I will be back and will definitely recommend this spot. It was delicious. Loved the Sauce that came with the spring roll (Yummy)."}
{"text":"I've been to Spring Rolls twice and both times I loved it, so I'm not sure what's with all the hate fellow yelpers.   First off, this is a pretty affordable restaurant with great food in the heart of the hustle and bustle of the city. I LOVE thai, but I confess I'm more into western thai (so not too fishy and not too spicy) and Spring Rolls does an amazing job of satisfying my cravings.  The first time I ate here I got the cashew chicken and nom nom nom I ate the entire thing (actually this was at the other Spring Rolls on queen). It was a pretty generous portion too, but that stuff was addictive. I didn't even feel guilty. Nope, it was worth it.   This time I had mango salad with chicken satay skewers. Normally chicken satay is like meh, whatever, good enough, but this satay was INCREDIBLE. I actually think I am going to be craving it again for days and weeks to come. White meat, nicely seasoned with a flavourful peanut dip nestled upon a bed of greens and crisp yet ripe mangos and red peppers....yes please!  The ambiance is also nice. Just really great contemporary Asian decor that is quite lovely. Service here is prompt, friendly but nothing flashy. I didn't have to ask for any refills or anything which was highly appreciated on this toasty day.    Totally recommend this place. It's a small chain, but it's scrumptious. Everyone at both my parties were more than satisfied!"}
{"text":"After agreeing to go here for a date, I immediately regretted it. And my opinion was not swayed during dinner. Everything, from the decor, to menu to presentation of dishes to even the servers is mediocre, uninspired, and bland. I ordered the sake maki and it was more expensive here than at the Japanese restaurant I frequent. More expensive and tasteless."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Asian fusion to begin with, but this place is just the worst. I've been here a couple of times and I have always walked out wondering why I wasted my time and money at this place. I'm writing this review to remind myself to try my absolute best to never come back again.   If you're a fan of huge portions of bland food this is where you need to be for the AYCE! If otherwise, this is a complete waste of time and money. It took a while for the orders to come around. Throughout the meal we ordered dumplings, sushi, tempura, some soups, seaweed salad, mango salad, Pad thai, and fried rice. The dumplings were probably some of the worst I've ever had, hard and dry wrappers with just a weird taste for the filling. The siu mai were especially off. I swear if you walked up the street to Chinatown and bought a couple bags of frozen dumplings and heated them up at home you'd be doing yourself a favor. Pad-thai was AWFUL, basically just a plate of bland noodles. Their sushi is not horrible but for the price of the AYCE you are better off going to a more authentic Japanese sushi place.   Their a la carte priced menu is not all completely disgusting. Pretty comparable to mall food court Asian food unfortunately, just plated nicely with garnishes and a few fresh ingredients. Again stay away from the Pad Thai!!! I would never recommend this place to anyone but if you find you are forced to lunch with some friends at Spring Rolls and they will not be swayed by the close proximity of this location (like I was) you might be better off with a la carte."}
{"text":"*First: I always admire and appreciate a server who's unafraid to tell me that I've ordered a dish that's not the best--especially when it's the most expensive thing on the menu. Thanks!*  A just-off-the-plane, sleepy tourist, my friend and I were easily enticed by the pretty girl with the pretty menus outside Spring Rolls after discovering that Camros was closed for the G20 Summit.  Typical dim sum dishes (sticky rice in lotus leaf, steamed shrimp in rice noodle rolls) taste a little funny in such a chic, well-designed space with Gangster's Paradise on the radio; the sangria was juicy, but it didn't make lunch feel less disjointed.  I'm not really complaining, just a little confused. $25 for a delicious meal for two is spectacular, and I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Decor was the best part.  Went with a party and it was very busy so service suffered.  Far too many options with the menu and hence quality suffered.  If you hate authentic asian food, then this is the place for you.  Not for my group.  Also brought out 2 incorrect appetizers.  I would likely not return."}
{"text":"Worse place to have lunch at. I ordered a few fried dishes and a few sushi dishes. All of the fried ones came first for some odd reason the sushi took an hour when it only takes less than 5 mins tonmake. The salmon was really warm which it is not supposed to be. I guess their trick is to make you full first from the oily food so you wouldn't order anymore since it is a all you can eat lunch menu. I ordered dessert which is the creme brûlée.... IT WAS TERRIBLE! The top was unbreakable and the inside tasted so sweet. A creme bride is supposed to shatter once using a spoon to crack it... the inside isn't supposed to taste like a bag full of sugar. The waiter was really rude, he was an Asian man with long hair. He never came to get our empty dishes and would walk fast by us when we tried to get his attention for the bill. This is by far the WORSE place to have a lunch experience. I will never come back ever even when I live literally 2 minutes away. Oh! I also ordered brownies which wasn't chewy or soft at all, it was so hard and tasted really bland."}
{"text":"I like Spring Rolls for the cheap drinks.  Maybe drinks are cheap all across Canada, but I was impressed here.  I think the drinks we ordered were around $6 or so?!  Delicious.  I'd recommend the Fruit Frenzy.  Food is kind of fake Thai or Americanized/Canadized Thai?  Definitely does not taste like pad thai you'd get in the bay area, but it wasn't bad tasting.  Service was friendly and fast, and the meal was pretty affordable for somewhere this \"trendy.\"  I'd come back."}
{"text":"EDIT: So I'm not the first to review this location.  Spring rolls has been tried & tested so many times that it's the go-to place whenever nobody in our group wants to think of a new place to check out. Needless to say, I was surprised that there was a new Spring Rolls in Fairview Mall.   We came here for a friend's birthday expecting the usual affair (which is good), and we were not disappointed. The decor in this Spring Rolls is pretty damn nice! They have this giant glowing center piece (I like pretty lights), which definitely set the mood off right. They still had signs up outside saying that they were open for business post-renovations.   Started off the night with some sake (hot) and went straight to the main (green curry w/ rice). The food at Spring Rolls is the same regardless where you go: a solid 8/10. The reason for this review is the service. We had a pretty awesome waiter, Kevin (I think...), who kept on top of all of our moving around and made sure we had everything we needed. At one point in the night, the fire alarm went off and he made sure to go table-to-table to let the customers know what the situation was (some kids pulled the alarm for fun). He even got involved with a discussion we were having about phones: all-in-all, we had a very comfortable experience ....which isn't something that all Spring Rolls can boast.   TL;DR: Came for the food, stayed for the service. Also learned that food isn't free if someone pulls a fire alarm."}
{"text":"Hmm... what to say about this place?  Well, five of us ate here this past Saturday.  Two of us had their All-You-Can-Eat menu while the other three ordered items off the menu.  FOOD  For those that ordered off the menu, they enjoyed their dishes.  Myself, I did the AYCE and tried their sushi items which I found a bit disappointing.  The sushi rolls had a bit too much rice and the sashimi was a bit small (though of course you can order as much as you want).  The other dishes I tried were pretty average (not bad but not great).  SERVICE  Service was, shall we say, slow as we had to wait often to reorder items for the AYCE and it took a while to get our bill and pay.  This may be a staffing issue as the server was always running around and the place isn't that big.  CHECK-IN BONUS?  When we went, there was a 'Check-in' bonus offer where if four people ordered the AYCE can eat menu, then one of the four ate for free.  We were advised that this was an old promotion and no longer valid.  Apparently the manager was going to contact their IT person to have it removed.  The manager apologized and was willing to offer us a discount or coupon for a future meal but he seemed to disappear when it came time to pay our bill.  --  Anyhow, they have a large varied menu and based on the majority of people I was with, they seemed to enjoy their meal.  For my tastes though, if I was in the neighbourhood, I wouldn't return a second time."}
{"text":"Hurray for all you can eat - we were stuffed leaving this place!   I initially was craving sushi, so I got sushi. The menu had a great variety of choices, including dim sum and pad thai. We were delighted with the dessert - mango crème brulee. Yum.  Service was slow and dinner was $25.99. Sounds pricy, but we originally planned to go to Spring Sushi (also $25.99) and they had a 30min waitlist.   I don't know of any other AYCE places downtown, so I would be back."}
{"text":"Awful awful place. Really bad service . We went at 9 45 and they said as or last call is at 10 we won't take ur order as you might not enjoy the food . This is the manager of the place . When I ordered normal food they were out of veggies and I ended up getting a whole lot of broccoli and chicken. Thai green curry was like re heated food. Bad service bad food . So if I r looking for a spring rolls there are many in toronto just avoid this its just bad."}
{"text":"I am a fan of this Spring Rolls and have never been disappointed. What kills me is the wait time   at this location - it's crowded on a week day and expect to wait for 15-20 minutes. The food is great and of the right quantity. They have the All You Can Eat option but I usually don't go for it. They usually have certain cocktails and you can mix that with some pan-Asian food which makes the ideal combination for me. I would love for them to have some more vegetarian options. Staff is busy and is more interested in making sure that you finish your food quickly so that others can come in. Overall, a great place of you want to quickly have a meal. If you are looking for a place to sit, chat and catch up with your friends and colleagues, perhaps think of a different option!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best and fairly overpriced. Feels like a tourist trap. I've had the salmon with pad thai, Korean beef short ribs, mango salad and spring roll platter here and nothing was that special except for the spring roll platter. I would definitely order that again. The ambience is nice though, feels like a \"high-end\" restaurant and is very clean.  If I'm ever craving Asian food, Spring Rolls would never be my first choice."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch takeout. Service was a bit slow, my order took around 5-10 minutes. I ordered a vegetarian bento box. It was filling. Taste was decent. Really enjoyed the tempura. Came with miso soup, that was quite salty and I couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"During a weekend trip to Toronto, we surprised a friend of mine who works on Front Street and afterward headed to Spring Rolls for lunch. They've recently (so the server told me) added some lunch specials - basically soup/appetizer/main combos for about $14.  I had some tom yum soup, shrimp dumplings, and shrimp satay pad thai.  My wife didn't go for the special, instead choosing black bean chicken with noodels (ho fun, I think it was called).  So, the food - outstanding all around. Promptly served, piping hot, and I can say without hesitation that I have never had such a great pad thai, and it came with 10 massive shrimps... no shortchanging there.  The tom yum was a small serving, very sweet and spicy as it should be, and shrimp dumplings were also great.  My wife's meal was MASSIVE.  Like, unfinishably large, especially after she had gyoza-like dumplings from the dim sum menu (once the rather snotty server lectured her a little on dim sum).  It was also very, very tasty.  So, you'd think I'd have four stars for them.  I don't, and here's why.  The service was miserable.  Between the slightly pretentious server at first and the fact that it was like pulling teeth to get some more water (it was lunch, and I'd just got off a plane), I just wasn't amued.  Those are relatively basic things they were doing wrong."}
{"text":"Small portions. Make sure to order more than one dish so you don't get stuck waiting for your order. Great service."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy eating at Spring Rolls especially the Fairview Mall location, but our experience at the Yonge Dundas location was less than pleasurable. The restaurant like all other Spring Rolls is visually appealing and clean. We ordered the Lettuce Bulgogi wraps, which was generous and very tasty, but there were not enough salad wraps so we asked for more, then we saw a $3 charge on our bill for a handful of iceberg lettuce leaves. We also ordered the Sizzling Kalbi dish that was beautiful and as advertised, sizzling, but the meat was tough, almost un-chewable, cheap meat. The red of the meal was sorta OK, but not well seasoned. We asked for an order of Ho Fun, a simple yet delicious dish, and it was bland, a simple test for any Asian kitchen. Less than impressed and we'll probably not return."}
{"text":"3.5*  In what was formerly a HOOTERS bar, this conveniently located Spring Rolls has been a staple restaurant of the area. The modern interior offers good ambiance for any occasion. There is a bar at the front with TV screens and an outdoor patio for the summer.  At one point our family had dined here so frequently we got to use the party room on the third floor. Knowing, the owner I could give this restaurant a high rating, but I feel it is only fair to provide an informed rating for the general public.  I was impressed at the calibre of sushi offerings when the option for this became available at the chain. I believe it has since gone downhill a tad (the last green dragon I had included an uncomfortably warm roll topped with browning avocado), but the mains and sharable dishes are flavourful and IMO better than they've been in the past.  It can be a bit pricey here with mains running $13-17, but, for the service, and venue, I think it is appropriate. Its nice to come here every so often for the change of environment.  I recommend the Black Pepper Beef and the C6 - (seafood - scallops, shrimp, grilled calamari with veggies in a mild and delicious sauce).  I was recently here with my sister and her boyfriend and the owner, recognizing us as loyal diners, from a couple years ago, gave us complimentary cheesecake :) What a nice guy...he knows how to treat a regular and will remember you."}
{"text":"Its unfortunate that this restaurant gets such a bad rap for being a chain. In my books it is certainly at least a high-end chain restaurant and maintains great ambiance, service and good food across all locations. (where else can you get sexy bathrooms in an Asian restaurant without paying through the nose?)  Ironically, this location happens to be my favorite! The restaurant right off the bustling Dundas Square, offers the same level of modern design, but with a lower-key and more intimate interior. It's really nice to sit in the big booths beside the large windows, low lighting really sets the mood. The service here is really personalized and attentive.   The food is most admittedly delicious. The portions are big and the the pricing moderate (comfortably $25/head incl tax+tip) I say its worth every penny and I very much enjoy coming to this location. It feels like your splurging at a classy restaurant but without busting your wallet.  I like to order a few mains and share them in a pot-luck manner to get the best of all worlds, or in this case tasty dishes. I recommend the chicken breast w/ portobello mushroom, the black pepper beef, special rolls, and stir-fried seafood w/ veg."}
{"text":"I work right upstairs of this location at BMO and I will not be returning. It was just awful, I ordered the dynamite roll it was the nastiest thing I ever had.... I only had three pieces and had to take the avocados out as they were brown!! not just spots but the whole thing was brown. slobbered in mayo and nasty. For the price you charge please be a bit more presentable.   Lesson learned- don't be lazy, go to sushi one for any sushi cravings.   Blah"}
{"text":"This place exists mainly to have an Asian food option that isn't in a food court and without having to go to Spadina. It's a tourist trap, basically.  The food isn't bad. The portions are about half the size of Chinatown and a few dollars more, but again, see tourist trap designation.   It's been ages since I came here. I try not to go as it reminds me of what the Asian version of East Side Mario's would be like. Formulaic Asian food, over priced and generic.  I will say the place is clean, nice, and the service I've gotten I don't ever remember being bad. It's got tons of seating upstairs, downstairs and on the patio. The Ho Fun is decent.   I also wouldn't say don't go. It's not a bad restaurant. But it's pretty ho-hum and uninspired, pretty much the way it was designed from the start.  (Incidentally, I think this is what in Canada we get instead of PF Changs, which I like a lot better)"}
{"text":"two stars for the amazing servers i dealt with!! super friendly and understanding when my entree was beyond horrible.. the menu said the mango salsa on the salmon pad tai would be spicy  .. well it wasn't! it was a bunch of overcooked red noodles with some sort of gross smellimg oil on it that smelled rancid and something even worse than minute maid noodles... the salmon itself had a boiled only texture not grilled like the menu claimed so i had no choice but to send it back i tried adding some pepper and salt but nope that was a dissaster still... had it all sent back and taken off my bill cuz if i ate that i know for sure i wouldn't be here to post this review i'd be sick somewhere...  change the menu tell the people it is not spicy not flavoured in any way at least don't have a red pepper sign by the dish and send out some crap smelling like pile of red noodles and brocolli heads wirh a slice of boiled fish... :(:(  the sushi was okay but i had better elsewhere!!!  even the one at metro is better... will i go back there?? absolutely no way!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch on a weekday as a company outing (approximately 15 people).  We ended up all choosing the tasting menu which is essentially an all-you-can-eat menu whereby you keep ordering various dishes and they'll bring them out to you.  We placed our initial orders and ended up waiting over 30 minutes for our first round of dishes to come out.  We complained to the wait staff and they said that the reason our dishes were coming out so late is because of a computer printer issue!!  This was a ridiculous excuse as all the other tables seemed to be getting their food no problem  Even then, the food that came out was pretty bad quality.  The pad thai (a dish that should be pretty standard) was very pale and tasteless and pretty much had one piece of chicken and one shrimp on the whole plate.  All the other dishes that we ordered were similarly as bland.    We complained about the service and about the quality of food and the staff even had the nerve to tack on a mandatory gratuity fee.  I am never going to Spring Rolls again"}
{"text":"Crime (not a typo) brûlée took 30 minutes and I get this....see pic with lemon wedge next to it. Small...so small...two teaspoonfuls. Ugh. Terrible."}
{"text":"Yet another chain with an \"Asian\" name which caters predominantly to the (sarcasm)\"white people\"(/sarcasm) crowd.  The ambiance is great, reminds me of \"Earls\", if you like cookie-cutter, western style places, but don't expect anything authentic.  The service is normal, rushed \"Earl's\" type.  We didn't opt for 'all you can it' although, on a second thought, it might have been better value for the money.  We had the Sui Mai Dim Sum (highlight of the meal), I had the General Tao Chicken which was way too greasy and too breaded, and my girlfriend had Sizzling Bulgogi Platter, which tasted like regular shredded beef, none of that special bulgogi taste you get if you go to a proper Korean BBQ in Korea Town (Christy/Bloor).  When the bill came the tipping 'proposals' (for your convenience, you know) were 15%, 18% and 20%!!! What's up with these places along Yonge Street? Do they think only Americans eat there? This is not USA where wait stuff gets paid $2/hr, but Canada, where they must get minimum wage or more."}
{"text":"My friend and I visited here the other day, after catching a late afternoon movie. I've been here many times before but this was the first time I indulged in their AYCE sushi.  Decor is modern with eclectic art throughout the dining area.   Service was friendly and relatively prompt. I think we had a few different servers asking if we needed anything which was a really nice touch. If we wanted to order some more anyone passing by was willing to help.  Drink menu is extensive with lots of choices for cocktails, wine or non-alcoholic drinks. I ordered a raspberry ice tea which was refreshing and not too sweet.   Highlights of the dishes we tried: Veggie explosion roll - a mix of avocado, mango and sweet potato tempura. Mango tempura roll - mango, cream cheese and pieces of tempura flakes. Fudge bites (dessert) Raspberry chocolate mousse (dessert)  I would highly recommend checking out the options at spring rolls. My only concern would be the price point for a weekend AYCE sushi, $28 before taxes seems somewhat excessive.  All in all, an enjoyable dining experience."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is an up and coming establishment with numerous restaurants around Ontario serving Pan Asian cuisine. Its new location in Brampton, serves up quality food but its poor service hinders it and holds it back from being good. When you first walk in to Spring Rolls, it looks and feels like a great Spring Rolls Restaurant with its modern and contemporary decor. We went here for the AYCE (All You Can Eat) lunch. The food is very good and very well-seasoned. I had Tom Yum Soup, Pad Thai, Lobster Fried Rice and many more which were all fantastic. However, not all things were as great as the food. The service was poor and always wanted to rush us into eating faster. When we would want to order more, the waiter would give us a bad look and give us an impatient attitude when writing the order. At one point, the waiter left us when we were still telling him what we would have. The waiter was disrespectful and it really impacted on how I view Spring Rolls. The restaurant serves up quality food with amazing decor to eat in but its poor service really makes this not worth going. I rate this restaurant a 2 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"The place is nice in terms of decor and atmosphere. The menu is also extensive. The service is horrible, rude, slow, and snotty. The food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Didn't like the food at all, it didnt taste like real asian food. It was pretty much just noodles in it, even though I was supposed to have tofu and vegetables."}
{"text":"Rating - 2.5   Had dinner here this week with a friend. The temperature in the restaurant was incredibly warm and unbearable which made my dining experience difficult. However the restaurant is modern and is located close to a mall and TTC. We ordered ginger chicken, general tao chicken, rice and gyoza's to start. The food reminded of something you would receive from a Chinese take out restaurant. Nothing special. The gyoza's were filled nicely with pork and vegetables but were soggy when we received them and not crispy. The broccoli in my ginger chicken was bitter and I couldn't understand why. Other than that the dish was fine. The general tao chicken had a nice kick but the sauce made the vegetables limp. The portions are large and you do get good bang for your buck. Please note that rice is not included with your entrees. Perhaps, I am being very critical but I've dined at the Spring Rolls in downtown Toronto and always found their food much more fresh. On a positive note, their service was great and the staff were attentive."}
{"text":"Heard that this was pretty good second hand and thought it was going to be like PF Changs. The layout was modern and open.  At the end of the night, however, realized that PF Changs is way better. Spring Rolls has very average food which was too pricey for the quality. Service was a disappointment. Very bored looking staff who tended to disappear on us quite often."}
{"text":"Best location and the service is ok and the food is fresh and good and good atmosphere and it's a great place to plan a party !!"}
{"text":"Don't be put off by dodgy bland mall. This is a good spot to eat prior to a movie. Also there is a huge restaurant within. The  front is glitter. There is more inside. Other Spring Rolls are better for sure but ok quality. Service was good. My friend tipped 20 percent. I thought service was ok."}
{"text":"shitty service......when i am ordering the waitress kept yelling at me and without any patience"}
{"text":"Moderate price for bland, watered down versions of authentic dishes. (translation: waste of money)  People go here because it looks nice and it sounds safe.  You're on yelp, find something better."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is a thai and japanese fusion restaurant with random asain dishes thrown in (dimsum anyone?). I was here with a larger group for a weekday dinner and had a mediocre experience. I had the veggie pad thai, which was edible but can't hold a candle to the authentic thai restaurants now available in the downtown core.  What really bugged me was the service. We tried to flag for service several times and the other service staff would tell us to wait for our server. All the while they were just standing there in a cluster with nothing to do and chatting. Our server was understandably busy and eventually got back to us, but I found the disregard from the other staff rude and unnecessary."}
{"text":"Went for AYCE lunch. Service was great. Had korean bbq beef, kung pao chicken, fried shrimps and manchurian chicken. All great. Padthai was ok.  Overall, definitely will go again."}
{"text":"Went for the AYCE lunch special on an empty stomach (obviously!). Service is very good. Food is good. Malaysian spicy fried rice and green curry chicken was great. Thai spicy noodle was ok and the hot and sour soup was ok too. Sushi, spring rolls, shrimp bites are all good. For under $20 per person, the food, comforting atmosphere and good service, this has always been my go-to place when i'm craving chinese/thai/fusion comfort food."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and there is a variety on the menu. If you feel like something Asian but can't quite think of something specific there is cuisine here for everyone! The prices are reasonable and portions are quite good. This place is a good ace to have on standby ^^  NOTE: I really like the Spring rolls restauranta but quality at locations differ. After being at the BCC location a couple of times I realized that their quality ans service is inconsistent and therefore I am giving them 3 stars"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere...horrible spring rolls"}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is a great restaurant with big portions at reasonable prices.  We shared an appetizer of spring rolls, and for main course one of us had the grilled salmon with pad thai, the other had Tango Mango. All of the food was delicious, and served piping hot!  I would definitely return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"One way of seeing if a place that serves ethnic food is any good, see if there are any people of that ethnicity eating there. It was pretty late on a friday, we were tired and we didn't want to eat in the Eaton food court. So we went to Spring Rolls. And we didn't follow the rule aforementioned.  The stir fry seafood was cold when it came and it looked like it had been microwaved. The vegetables were so overcooked the whole dish was watery. It left a slimy feel in my mouth; after just a few bites, I didn't even want to keep eating.  The chicken with cashew nuts were a bit better, but not by much. It was warm at least.    So Spring Rolls, never again! Such a shame really, such a waste of a great location."}
{"text":"We went to Spring Rolls and tried out their AYCE Dim Sum and Sushi.    $16.95 per person.  Lots of choices of dumplings, sushi, small noodle plates and a few things for dessert.  We had the Dragon Roll, the tempura sampler, har gow, sui mai and sexy rolls and some other things.  This Spring Rolls is just south of Bloor on Yonge.  It does get busy so you may wait for a table. AYCE Sushi and Dim sum is served from 11 to 4 pm on the weekends.  Beyond this, we have had Pad Thai at this location and always enjoyed it.  There are a number of Green P lots nearby for parking or take the Subway."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here last week and we did not have a good experience. We came for the all you can eat lunch. Our server was very rude. He would come to take our order and leave as we are finishing our sentences. He got our request wrong but challenged us when we asked him for the missing items. We had to ask for water so many times before we got it and we never got a refill. The waiter even tried to take a plate away that we weren't finished with. The whole time the waiter wouldn't even make eye contact or ask us how things were going.  The variety of the food was so limited. The food tasted okay but it was nothing to write home about. The only thing this place has going for it is that it is in a nice location and decorated well. However, our experience was so bad I can't give it more than one star."}
{"text":"I usually frequent this joint during the week for a quick bite. However,  my visit yesterday was surprisingly refreshing as I was offered a brunch menu which was pretty elaborate.  I was not aware of this.  The food is good and its value for money just under $20 you could eat to your hearts content from the assortment of sushi to a variety of Thai Chinese Japanese and Korean meals.  The place is extremely busy with wait times extending up to 30 minutes and it is definitely under staffed which is why I would award 4 stars instead of 5. The staff is polite and courteous but just cannot seem to cope with the workload   Personally, I do not like a gap between dishes, meaning I hate to wait. Therefore I recommend my fellow Yelpers do order a substantive quality, enough that would fill you up in one go. If you contemplate ordering in increments,  then be prepared to wait and the wait sometimes is lengthy.    I would recommend this place sans the wait time it offers the value for money and sn array of fresh delicious food"}
{"text":"Pretty average place.  We ordered the AYCE menu at $25pp.  I naturally compared the food against the AYCE in Markham.  The cooked appetizers such as Korean Short Ribs were good. The sushi was bad as the rice fell apart when I picked it up.  The sashimi was okay no more fresh than other AYCE.  The salad was good.  The tempura was a pass.  The shrimp dumplings (har gaw dim sum) were over cooked and the texture of the shrimp was off.  The interior decoration was nice, clean, contemporary and pleasantly dimmed.  The services were good.  We were presented with 3 not-on-menu appetizers free of charge.  It is an okay place.  I wish the sushi was better put together.  In addition, if they cannot keep the dim sum quality in check, they may be better off taking them off the menu."}
{"text":"Not too shabby! I'm always really choosey about where I go to eat Thai or any kind of Asian food because I'm allergic to shellfish and I really don't want a waiter that doesn't care about that fact.  But this was not the case with Spring Rolls. I ordered the veggie fried rice, which was really plain but very delicious. Plus, the prices are reasonable without having to sit in a dumpy place to enjoy it (actually the decor is nice, the place is clean)."}
{"text":"wow, i am surprised by the bad reviews. i didn't bother to see why the bad reviews, but let me tell you why i liked the place.  the decor and stuff is nice. it looks like a pricier restaurant, but most of the items are close to $10-15 per plate. however, this aren't small plates, you can prob share.  i tried the curry pad thai. i never seen it with curry, so i figured i ll try it. it was pretty good. the curry had a nice kick, but the curry flavor was very subtle, not overwhelming at all. the spring rolls were decent too.  i am pretty sure there are better thai places to eat, but i thnk it was decent.  the only thing i didn't like was their fusion thing. they got thai, chinese, a bit of korean. i mean, wth, stick to one or 2 cuisines. their thai menu was good i can attest for that."}
{"text":"I order from this spring rolls regularly. They are fast and efficient and I love how they never mess up my order (I have a lot of allergies/requests). Customer service is good. Food is a solid 3.5. I LOVE thai food and their famous pad thai is anything but authentic... But I do order it still from time to time. I love the crab and cream cheese dumplings and the fried banana dessert. The AYCE prices are a little steep for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Service is pretty good, our server was actually great and kept coming to check up on us and gave us time with the menu. But that wasn't enough to save the experience from the food. Came here with a 9-year old only because we had a gift card. FYI- there's no kids menu.  We had vegetable spring rolls, which were okay but expensive at $4.99 for 3. The sauce that came with them was confusing, the 9-year old thought it was ketchup? Then we had a green curry, this was our shared main as we were here for lunch. It was dry and not in a bowl of sauce as I would have expected. The vegetables and flavour were okay, but the tofu had a weird bitter taste so both of us avoided eating much of it.  The mousse dessert was standard, but also room temperature which worried me (warm dairy!). She seemed to enjoy it though!"}
{"text":"Lunch was great i got the shanghai noodles, they were good! I would try the spicy ones next time or sushii"}
{"text":"Have been here three times now because of work/friends, and each time has been a disappointment - primarily because of the food.   The first time my friend ordered green Thai curry and it was watery, flavourless, and cold.   The second time we ordered sweet and sour chicken, and the sauce was way too tangy and sweet. The third time we ordered Classic Pad Thai and again, way too tangy and sweet, the noodles were bright pink. Maybe they think tangy and sugary food tastes good?   Will probably never eat here again if I can avoid it. And given how many Asian restaurants are in Toronto, it won't be too hard.   2 stars because the servers are really nice."}
{"text":"Our waitress was the worst I've ever seen. As we sat down, we told her that we were waiting for a friend to join us and that we will get drinks first. She wasn't too friendly, didn't really say anything or show any smile. She came back a few minutes later and asked us what we would like to eat. We repeat ourselves saying that we are waiting for a friend and gave her our order for drinks. She came back with our drinks and we were in a middle of a conversation and we suddenly hear her laughing out loud about what we were saying. You don't acknowledge your customers earlier and suddenly you laugh at their conversation out of no were. Fine, she is just a bit awkward, at least she's trying. As our friend finally arrive, he asked for a glass of water. She comes back with it and dropped the whole glass on my husband pants. She apologized none stop, and we tell her it's ok (just to shut her up after the 20th time) and she kept going on and on. As she is whipping the table, she suddenly laugh out loud again about what just happen and said this is the first time it happen and she will never do it again. I guess it is funny to sit in your wet pants/underwear all night while eating. Ok fine, whatever, she is just a bit weird. She came back later to take our order, we asked her about the sushi, what is in there and what is what. Her answer: \"I don't know, I don't eat sushi.\" And then, silent! She didn't even bother asking her colleague to explain it to her, she just stop and stare at us, and wait for us to figure it out ourselves. Food arrive very slow, some order never came out, (we had the all you can eat), and the food, wasn't as good as the other Spring Rolls we've tried before. Their pad thai tasted like those fluorescent sauce that you can buy in the bottle in chinatown. We ordered a lobster salad each and they dumped it all on one plate, when the other Spring Rolls will put it in a nice martini glass for each person. It was embarrassing for us as we were telling our friends to go there to try out their all you can eat because we liked it last time. Well, maybe it was only this location. I'll make sure not to come back to this one. Ohh and also, they do not take Debit! For a big restaurant like that, kind of inconvenient."}
{"text":"bwahahahaha. ahhhhh hahahahaha. WTF????????????? bwahahahaha.  ahhhhh hahahahaha.  i think my semi-mentally-challenged-Jack Russell Terrier can cook a better meal using only his canned dog food better than Spring Rolls. seriously... WTF?  i thought NY had some pretty horrible Thai restaurants, but damnnnnnnnnnn yo!   i don't even want to comment on what the hell we ordered- because everything tasted exactly the same. DISGUSTING and NOT THAI. lol"}
{"text":"Everything here was kinda meh, overcooked korean shortribs served with a big mound of flavourless rice and undercooked veg. the kimchi was dece. gf had a lobster roll which was huge and she enjoyed. I had chicken satays w/mango salad as a starter and again it was huge amount of mango salad, but just underseasoned salad and overcooked meat.   my pint of sapporo was great, felt the service was a little slow, but they were accommodating at  finding us a seat at 7pm on a bust weeknight. service was 3/5 food 2/5"}
{"text":"Pad Thai was not very good, honestly tastes like noodles & ketchup. Made me doubt the authenticity of this place. Ambience and service was pretty nice, though.  Green tea came from in teabag form, not exactly what I was expecting. Spicy Thai noodles were decent. Of the four noodle dishes we sampled this one was the best but you need to like spicy things. Eggplant was actually quite good. But avoid the Pad Thai at all costs!"}
{"text":"This is probably the third or fourth time I've been to Spring Rolls.  But, this is the first time I've been to the Bay Atrium one, found across from the Eaton Centre.  We came for the lunch buffet menu on NYE, but the bf wasn't very hungry unlike myself, so we did not order too much.  Fortunately, we did not have to wait, perhaps because it was still early.    I do not remember everything we ordered, but we had: Triple Cheese Dumplings Shrimp Tempura Chicken Shanghai Noodles  Avocado & Cucumber Handroll Avocado & Crab Handroll  & other handrolls and rolls  I thoroughly enjoyed the triple cheese dumplings; it's my favourite and I get it every time.  The bf really enjoyed the shrimp tempura and sushi.  Unfortunately, I don't remember the names of the rolls he ordered.  However, chicken pad thai we had was on the sour side and we did not finish it.  The chicken shanghai noodles were good, though slightly saltier than usual.    Overall, we spent $33 on our meal, excluding tips. The premium menu is a $3 upgrade, but we weren't that hungry so we did not get it. However, we may try it next time because it had dessert items (which I love) and steak.  It's a reasonable price for a buffet menu, at $14.99 per person for lunch"}
{"text":"This was a \"Do Over\" experience as I have not been to a Spring Rolls in a fairly long time due to my last few experiences not to be the greatest, so my hopes for this one were rather high! When my friend and I walked in I could barely hear the host as the music was blasting, I had to ask him to repeat himself Three times! When we were ready to order, I asked the waitress a direct and simple question, (do they still do \"small portions\" of wonton soups if asked for\") she had No idea what I was asking, when both myself and my friend repeated it again, I expected her to go ask the kitchen at the very least she just stood there looking blank! I just took a deep breath, and ordered my meal instead! When the food Finally came, it was luke warm at best, I tried getting her attention, but nope, we were served (by someone else) and so she was done! I ate it because I was hungry. I won't even go into my friends soup! Ick Ick and Ick!! To say I am Severely disappointed is being polite!"}
{"text":"At $26 per person for the AYCE option, you better come here hungry!  The restaurant was nice and clean.  I didn't that there was another floor below us for dining.    We were seated pretty quickly and here before the dinner rush - approx 4:30pm.  Water it's the standard unless you want to pay extra for drinks - even tea.  You'd that that at an asian restaurant, tea would be included.  Anyways, I ordered a green tea... but never got it.  It seemed like a few items that we ordered either didn't come out at all or was wrong.  For an all you can eat place, it was weird having someone take your order.  Why not give me a list to check off or order electronically like many other places? The food quality was just ok.  - dim sum was lacking in texture and taste. - sushi was a pleasant surprise as it was nicely prepared and quite good. - steak was somewhat soggy.  Seemed like it was sitting in liquid for a long time.  Maybe it was to prevent it for drying out as it was such a thin piece? - dessert was good.  But how could you go wrong?  I wouldn't come back.  I would hit up the japanese ayce places instead."}
{"text":"The highlights are the prices and decor. As others have said, the main complaint is that the food is just bland. We had two lunch specials, she had the pad thai and I had the curry with shrimp and chicken. Both were just okay, there was little flavour to either one. The server also looked bored out of his mind, and although he was attentive, he wasn't all that friendly."}
{"text":"One of the worst experience in ayce. I came to the restaurant last three days for 3 times. And asked my friends to join me. The service was toooooo slow. And the waitress was so blind to see me and my friend. We have been waiting for our desert for ten mins , none come to ask.  After all, we payed  about 7% of total amount as tips because seriously I don't want to pay any tip for the service, but for respect. The waitress didn't say\" thank you\", oops , lose her last chance to get more tips. For God's sake, I am not going to here any more!"}
{"text":"Good menu with a variety of things to offer. Delicious food although not very ethnic. It does appeal to a wide range of people and thats what I like about their food. I spent my four undergrad years coming here regularly and still come here when I get a chance. Have found some other great places to eat but Spring rolls is still one of the better ones. Def recommend it to try for their dimsums and their pad thais."}
{"text":"First time at the Spring Rolls chain of Pan Asian fusion restaurants located in the city.  I was a little skeptical of these places that are a fusion of different styles of food especially if it was a chain.  In my past experiences with similar restaurants, the quality of the food was passable, but the fusion of the food was not to my liking.  We arrived with a birthday party of 30 people, we were greeted by our server and our area was in a semi private area of the upper floor.   The restaurant has an unusual 3.5 level tiered layout.  We were on the second floor of the restaurant but we were seated in another tiered level on the second floor and there was also another area similar to ours across the second floor of the restaurant.  I was a good place to sit because it took our group away from the hustle of the rest of the facility.    This particular location of Spring Rolls was one that featured a \"Tasting Menu\" that was another option instead of eating a la carte of the main menu.  The \"Tasting Menu\" is basically an all you can eat option of the regular menu (the portion sizes are smaller) but you tell your server what you want and they bring you what you ordered.  Knowing from past experiences in ordering at similar \"Tasting\" restaurants, you do not order 1 thing and then wait for it.  Depending of the size of the party and how busy your server gets in their section, you could be waiting quite a long time for the next opportunity to order your next dishes.  I usually order about 4-7 dishes at once.  This allows me the time to eat my selections and I am not waiting 10-15 minutes for my server to come back to re-order another selection.    The tasting menu also included all you can eat sushi, unagi, hand rools, lamb, steak, ribs, salads etc.. The value is $26.99 on the weekends, but easily worth it.  If you just order a la carte menu items plus and appetizer, you are basically paying about 24 dollars.  So why not have a taste of everything?  I ordered everything from sushi to Kalbi short ribs.  Our server was great and he was on top of all the orders in our group.  6-8 people decided on the \"Tasting Menu\" and all of us were very satisfied. I looked at some of the a la carte orders and the portion sizes were quite big (New Zealand Lamb in Red Curry, Sweet and sour chicken and Seafood Stir Fry.  Our group was very satisfied and I am definitely partaking on the \"Tasting Menu\" again.  A good 4 stars!!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for drinks, dim sum, oh and the pad Thai here is off the chain!   I don't really eat spring rolls anymore (don't ask) so I can't say if they're good or not here. The service here is okay, Iv never really had a problem here, so I can't really complain about anything. By reading the other reviews, I'll think I'll stay away from the Erin Mills location. The servers here are very attentive, even when i came here it was quite busy but still it was good service. I love the Decor, it's so unique and...pink! I have to say it drew me in somehow...   When I come back i wanna try their wonton soup and chicken fried rice, since I'm like a fried rice bandit, I have to try it soon!"}
{"text":"Really nice decor !  I thought this place felt really current and modern  It was a fusion Asian restaurant right by Dundas square.  I was here for the all-you-can-eat option dinner with family, but I feel I was disadvantaged since I wasn't able to order any of the seafood (allergies).  Definitely if you're into sushi and seafood this place is definitely for you!   Overall I thought the service was kind of slow but the environment was very young and vibrant!"}
{"text":"After a day at Ripley's Aquarium and losing NBA Game 7 of the Raptors vs Brooklyn Nets, our whole family was starving.  We walk on Front Street to Spring Rolls and there was 9 of us.  We sit down and order a ton of food.  I noticed that the Ho Fun noodles were not on the menu anymore so I specifically ordered the Submarine Roll (6 pieces Unagi, Avocado topped with Salmon & Tobiko) and Black Pepper Filet of Beef.  The food was decent 'nuff but could have been better.  The sushi was good and tasted okay with the wasabi but nothing jumping for joy over.  Regular sushi.  The tobiko was largely shaped so when I bit into the eggs, there was a squirt but not much flavour.  Ho hum.  The Black Pepper Beef was just a sea of sauce with little chunks of beef.  The bites were small and they were swimming in it along with the huge pieces of vegetables.  I didn't like it all so much and I wanted to forget about it.  Great to spend time with family but I have definitely had great Asian food elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had a discount that said 20% off at Spring Rolls from going to a musical, but when we got there they tried to tell us that it was only 10%. We were told different things by the hostess and our waiter, but in the end we did get 20% off.   The food was not up to par with regular AYCE sushi. The sushi was tasteless, the seaweed salad was still frozen underneath, and the menu was sightly more limited than the one presented online, although we were there for dinner. The sashimi was particularly bad."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night, the restaurant was very busy and I was excited for the Thai food. I ordered the Thai noodles and it was very oily. I wasn't expecting authentic Thai but the dish that came out wasn't even close. The spring rolls ordered were even unpleasantly greasy. My soup appetizer came out lukewarm. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Its a real hit an miss on food at this place.  I ordered from the dinnee special menu that gave me a choice of appetizer. I chose the tom yum soup which was so intensely sweet that i felt i was drinking sugar water with a few mushrooms and shrimp floating in it. Not tom yum at all.   The entree which was a salmon and pad thai was amazing. The portion size of the salmon was extremly generous, and the pad thai was quite tasty and had a goof amount of flavor! Again i want to emphasize on the big portion sizes, i could not finish the whole thing, and believe me i dont usually have leftovers!  The service was great. I felt the service level was way beyond the quality of the resturant."}
{"text":"I've been here three times and all were fantastic experiences. Their food is excellent, they have a large variety of choices, and the decor is beautiful. This is a great go-to place to hang out with friends and get some drinks, because its not one of those places where you eat and go. Additionally their service is pretty decent (I've experienced both good and bad)."}
{"text":"My mom and I eat here all the time. It's a really nice quiet place that's great for dinner. The only reason to eat here is because of the all-you-can-eat. Some of the food can be a little flavorless at times. You have to know the menu well enough to know what to order. Anything from the appetizer section or the dim sum section is great. Their mixed drinks are great too. The service is slow, especially over the weekend."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went to this place and we ordered their specialty Ramen and sushi combo 5.  NOTE: This place doesn't really serve you, so you do not need to give tips.  Sushi combo 5 was as good as it can get for $10. It came with 18 pieces of sushi, which included 6 pieces of California sushi, 6 pieces of Kim-chi sushi, and 6 pieces of tempura shrimp sushi.  Their specialty Ramen was not as good as I thought. In terms of content, it consisted of variety of food, which is awesome. But the soup tasted like a lot of instant noodle's soup. The price was $11, still worth the price if you eat only the content."}
{"text":"We were at this restaurant for dinner. The food is good and the atmosphere is nice. The service was great as our waiter really took his time to connect even though he was busy."}
{"text":"I'll never come back here again. The sea-food salad was a bunch of oily, greasy pseudo breaded calamari rings with nothing on it and the entree was a tasteless sushi/sashimi platter not to mention the dessert that was some sort of artificially flavored jello. All for 70$."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there for his birthday. The decor is absolutely beautiful and we were greeted by the very lovely and gracious owner herself, Rita, and let her know that she should be very proud of her chefs because the food is sublime. Danny our waiter was very sweet and on top of everything and I cannot get over how incredible the service was. Highly recommend the gyoza and cheese dumplings (as a non seafood eater they have a great variety of alternative options!) and they make the best peanut sauce I've ever had. My husband is in love with the Rainbow Roll and Sushi Pizza. Definitely my favorite Thai food restaurant."}
{"text":"been there twice and now i'm done! too expensive for my taste, i mean paying 24 box for a AYCE is not m type (of way)   The service was sooo slow, at the end you don't even want to eat anymore. i had my terikayi and pad thai served after my dessert...i mean WUT REALLY?  the sushi are ok not specials tho.   i had a crush for the cheese dumpling,i took 4 ( or 6, i might be in denial) but it was the only thing that i really like  and how about this AYCE which close at 2:45! i mean if you end it at least try to be fast in you orders, we came at around 2:30/1pm and i had this feeling that i couldn't fill full my craving because of this ultimate. of course i don't want to sleep there till night but still tho!"}
{"text":"They were out of spring rolls and wonton early in the middle of the day.  How messed up its that?  Server was funny but not too bright, taking away or silverware while expecting us to prose or own take out. Busy but no wait.  Food is OK but nothing that merits the menu prices."}
{"text":"When I want to pig out and eat like a huge man, my go to spot is Spring Rolls. The price is fair (28.99 for dinner) for all you can eat and the quality is relatively good.   The sushi is alright. The variety is limited but it is fresh tasting and has good sushi rice. I would pass on the sashimi.  The shrimp dim sum is great and so are most of the appetizers.  Service is always quick, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I am a little bit of a chain restaurant snob, but this is not bad.  Although it's not really authentic, with the flavours dumbed down a little, the food is of a reasonable quality.  Many of the dishes (the pad thai in particular) come as huge portions.  I would like to see them \"un-Americanize\" things and offer smaller portions (at lower prices).  This particular location (just a few steps east of Yonge and Eglinton) is pretty nice by the way, especially if you can get a table on the second floor next to the window. They are also fast and efficient with their take-out orders."}
{"text":"The food is edible at best. I know that it is a fusion restaurant and it would suit people who are not accustomed to eating authentic asian.  The service was okay except I overheard our server kind of complaining as we walked by because our table wasn't ready.  It's different..the food is pretty fresh so I'd go back if I had to."}
{"text":"I recommend this place looking for an Asian fusion restaurant with affordable pricing and great portions. You may even consider splitting a plate in half if you don't want to over fill yourself and save some space for dessert."}
{"text":"24.99 for dinner on a Friday night  and you can only order maximum 5 pieces of sashimi per person for AYCE. Yet they had the guts to say  if you don't finish the dishes they gonna charge you. The har gao tasted so bad compare to regular dim sum places. The miso soup tasted like water. It absolutely had no taste in it.  Service wasn't that bad but it's just too pricey for dinner. I disliked how they only offer 5 pieces of sashimi per person. Cuz then i had to keep ordering from them which i found very annoyed. IF you are looking for mainly Japanese food then avoid this place."}
{"text":"For the people who think this place is great please think it again. I spend almost $20 dollars for a bowl of pad thai which it didnt' fill me at all. I can go to any other place spend less than that for a better quality and quantity. The Har gow they served us were piece of shit. Even the dragon pearl buffet's Har gow taste 100x better than the Har gow in Spring Sushi. The price is just not worth it. 24.99 for all you can eat are you kidding me? Most of the food on the menu were all decent. What i do not understand is that they only aloud to us to order 5 pieces of sashimi per person. That's kinda lame consider that the price is ridiculous high.  If you go by yourself. Have fun waiting for 5 pieces of sashimi for 20-30 min. The only good thing about this place is clean. But that' it the food is just garbage.  If i want to eat buffet i rather spend my money on Mandarin than this place. If i just want pad thai i rather go to Ginger. Which it's even better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls would've gotten a 3 but the non-existent service lowered my rating to a 2.  The last time I've been to a Spring Rolls restaurant was about two years ago, shocking! I chose Spring Rolls last night because my friend was raving about their ayce dinner.  The decor of this location is modern and veryyyy nice. They probably wanted you to be hypnotized by their beautiful decor so you would forget about their non-existent service. The menu is very extensive and will take you a while to look over and decide on something. Our waiter didn't give us enough time to look over the menu because he kept asking us if we were ready. We decided to not get the ayce because my friend didn't feel for it and I didn't want to look like a fatty. I ended up getting the tiger shrimp rolls and tango mango chicken while my friend got the thai royal castle fried rice.   The tiger shrimp rolls were pretty small that I highly doubt they were tiger shrimps. The tango mango chicken was good, however it was a bit spicy for me because I don't eat spicy foods. Our waiter never came to our table after taking our order so we had to flag another waiter down to get our bill.  Although the food was good, I wouldn't go here again because of the crappy service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my mom and we ordered the mango salad and shrimp pad thai. This is more of a fusion restaurant, so the food is not as authentic. But I still enjoyed the mango salad and pad thai. The decor is very modern, has more of a western feel."}
{"text":"I know that it may have been busy, I understand that, but unfortunately the service was HORRIBLE. I'm not overly picky because I have been a server myself for 5+ years, and understand the pressure of the job, but this was just unacceptable. When we got to our table, the seats were wet, not overly, but I could tell they were not cleaned properly due to food still on them. Our server took 11 minutes to greet us, then rushing us through our order. Secondly, food began to come out before our drinks, which was just water. So food usually comes out between 12-15 mins, so you could imagine how long we waited for our water. Along with our long wait for our water, she also did not punch in our food correctly. We waited for some sashimi, which took 45 mins to get out, which was FROZEN, which I immediately spit out, but unfortunately the bacteria still got in my system and made me sick later on that day. Along with the waiting, NO LAST CALL was given out, so we could not order any dessert or more food when we tried to. Our server just said, \"its after 3pm, I'm not taking any more orders\". That was really nice to know, throughout the whole meal, she didn't check up on us, and we had to flag her down to put in an order.   The server wasn't the worst of it. The WORST experience of our meal was the hostess. She did do her job, BUT her BUTT was showing. Her skirt was so short, that when she bent down to clean the tables, we saw EVERYTHING. I believe this is a family restaurant, is it not?"}
{"text":"Other reviews are spot on  service is usually pretty good and friendly but the food is terrible. i would just avoid this spot.  i keep having to go because one of my friends keeps booking meals there - i am not sure why tho.  i should tell him i hate this place."}
{"text":"Mehhhh mediocre food, nothing bad nothing great, it's like a of Changs, asian that's meant for non asian folks...prices are reasonable $10 for the curry pad thai veggie and $16 for the shrimp and kalbi   Portions are reasonable, service was a bit slow and nice decor  Will probably come back to check out the ayce"}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this spring rolls. The guys at work love this place so it has been the go-to for the past few months. We had a reservation for a party of 6. We normally sit upstairs but we were seated downstairs even though there was saying upstairs. Not a big deal.   We always come here for the all you can eat and this time we got the premium which includes more selection as well as dessert. There's so much to choose from. My personal favorites are the lemon grass chicken wings, tornado roll (which is basically shrimp rolled up in noodles and deep fried), Korean kalbi short ribs and the salmon sashimi.   For dessert I tried the mango sticky rice (I didn't taste mango), the tempura cheesecake and deep fried banana. Everyone loved the mango sticky rice. I liked the fact that the portions were small so that I can control the intake and try them all.  Overall they have average pan asian food. Nothing is exceptionally well done but it isn't bad either. It's great for larger groups because they have something for everyone. The service wasn't the greatest either since we had wait quite a bit before our orders were taken and then again for our first order to arrive. It's very possible that we were part of the dinner rush. The service did pick up as the night on.  It's worth checking out if you've never been. I've been to other locations where the food was marginally better like the Fairview and front street locations."}
{"text":"Disappointed with their food catering. Went for the all you can eat buffet. They don't prioritize your orders not unless you order from their regular menu. So you wait for a long time. By long, I mean 30 minute wait times every order. On a monday night! I don't blame the servers. Our server apologized all the time when he came to check on us. Been here 3 times, I never received my Miso Soup in every visit :(  The first visit was exciting because it 's a new place! I forgave their mistakes, I thought they could redeem themselves the next few visits. Guess not. Just writing an honest review based on experience. Try it if you'd like. Your experience will be different ofcourse.   I mean the food is great, I admit that, but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"This place is a sh*t show. Don't go here.  Service is terrible, food quality is awful."}
{"text":"Really don't get why this place is so popular. I had the pad thai and it tasted like noodles with bland ketchup sauce. While this may be a cheaper place (compared to other Thai restaurants) and is in a great location, it's still not worth your money or time. Lots of much better places pretty nearby (Khao San, Pai, etc) if you want value for your money."}
{"text":"awesome all u can eat lunch. Had a blast and ate so much food here. Food is great especially the appetizers. Definitely cheaper than most restaurants"}
{"text":"Being originally from Chicago and of Asian descent, I am always curious about Thai restaurants in other cities.    Spring Rolls is a nice, moderately expensive restaurant.  I was introduced to it on my visit to Toronto by my friend Steve.  After coming in from the rain, we made our way to this location of SR, there are others but since this is my virgin experience, I will talk about this place.  Decor is minimal, specialty drinks on the menu as well as standard libations.  I had the Saigonlini, smoothie with a dash of alcohol since I barely tasted it but refreshing to drink before lunch.  Steve didn't have any since he had a big day and night ahead unpacking after their movve.  Steve loves their shumai and orders the pork and shrimp shumai, I order the same and also a mango salad.  The service is efficient, clean and attentive.  Of course, weekday after the lunch crowd is gone is helpful but I thoroughly enjoyed eating here.  I truly treasure being able to talk to someone without the noise, loud music and busybodies on the next table.  All of the dishes were wonderful except I would prefer to dip my shumai in a soybased sauce rather than mustard and swt n sour sauce.  After the meal, we even got our picture taken together.  Truly I look awful in pictures..my eyes look like they are expecting something to happen and I rarely smile (by choice).  Overall, if you are in Toronto, and curious about Spring Rolls, go in look at the menu and have a nice Saigonlini on me (lots of it - just dont drnk n drve)"}
{"text":"Today is June 10, 2014. An agent named Wilson did call back to apologize for the mistakes on Friday and also Sunday.  He is polite and I am very happy he rectify the mistakes. :)"}
{"text":"Food was great...had a table of 10 for an after baptism dinner...our waitress was awesome. ..she is young but not like a typical pushy talkitive kind....she smiled...she is very polite. ..cud tell she was raised well...we all admire her...u know she wasn't lying about dishes...she let  us knew her favourite n she said she won't know very much about different wines cause she is allergic to alcoholic...we laughed n she blushed...her service is was we admire most...food was good...everyone enjoyed their entree...we will be back."}
{"text":"Worst. Chinese. Food. Eveeeeeeeeeeer.  Scarborough is really not that far.  Even randomly choosing a Chinese restaurant in east-end GTA, it's a guarantee that you'd would give you better food than what you get here.  I will admit, the Tom Yum soup here is outstanding!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Spring Rolls.   It's something a little different from the rest of the chain restaurants and has good quality, well priced food.  I highly recommend the Famous Pad Thai, the Dim Sums, and the Triple Cheese Dumplings.  Just writing about these makes me crave them so bad.  The service at this location is nothing special, but nothing to complain about, and the atmosphere is relatively fancy and refreshing.  The ONLY complaint I have is that the restaurant is cold. If you are going to Spring Rolls, bring a heavy sweater, because if they seat you next to one of the floor to ceiling windows, you will freeze.  Great restaurant overall. One of my favs!"}
{"text":"The inside of this place is very stylish. The service is friendly and efficient. The food is ok. Not exactly bad, but forgettable."}
{"text":"As with all the others in the Spring Rolls franchise, this location at Sheppard and Yonge is decent. The decor is light and airy with large windows. The staff is attentive and friendly. The food is the typical Westernized version of Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese and Japanese dishes. They had just added a line of ramen dishes, but frankly if you wanted ramen, why not go across the street to Kenzo? I don't believe that one single restaurant can specialize in so many different cuisine. I had the Thai Spicy Noodle and the dish was a little greasy especially the eggplant and was not spicy enough for me or my co-worker who ordered the same dish. The food is tasty enough, but with all the other mom and pop shops around this area touting authentic versions of the various cuisines, why not give those a try?"}
{"text":"Standard all you can eat menu is good value $16.99 for a broad range of ok food, as was the $1.99 for refill coke/tea.  Additional menu for extra $3 only worth it for the sashimi, the fried rice was terrible.  Service was slow, but friendly."}
{"text":"Super disappointed! I went here for my birthday and felt terrible for two days after eating here.  The spider roll was cut too thick, seaweed was super chewy in ALL sushi I ordered, and the crab was over cooked. My wontons were hard, over cooked doughy balls, and I was left waiting at the door to be seated longer than desired. I don't mean waiting for a seat, I mean waiting to see someone so I could be seated.  The desserts were probably the only thing I enjoyed, other than my salad. Everything I ordered I was disappointed with in some way or another :(  I will not be going again. Just a huge shit show."}
{"text":"I wish I could give NO STARS!!!   This was awful!!! My first experience at spring rolls and I am never going back. The food is horribly overpriced for very low quality. We ordered the green curry chicken(no flavor!!!!!) and the pineapple fried rice (where was the pineapple......it was also smothered in dried fish...is that where the flavor was supposed to come from?)  The chicken in both these dishes wasnt cut up properly, the broccoli pieces were the size of my fist...i could go go on...  This is a terrible excuse for a thai fusion...i really hope there is something better in Toronto ;("}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi in downtown. The food quality was pretty good but the service was unacceptable. Staff that passed our table wouldn't help us because they weren't our server\", but our server was no where to be found and when she did come by, she acted like taking our food orders was a big hassle."}
{"text":"You know what? I can't think of one bad thing about this place.   The food is great - its no fine-dining, but thats not what I was expecting. Great variety on the menu, good drinks, great service, nice decor, lots of seating.. even some patio space (this is hard to do right at Yonge and Eglinton).   My servers have always been friendly - the manager will often come by to see how everything is, too.   I am addicted to their rolls and well.. just about everything else. There is something for everyone on this menu. Steaks and salmon along with the Thai and Chinese staples. And might I add, I love their menu layout - lots of delicious pictures. It does make ordering quite the decision."}
{"text":"If you want to try many dishes, All You Can Eat Menu (AYCE)  is for you. The portions are smaller and not all the items from regular menu are included but you get the idea if Spring Rolls is for you or not. As for me - I probbaly won't come back. The service was good, even though noone cared if we liked the food or not. We had to send back couple of dishes and noone asked what was wrong, why we did not like it. Dishes that I liked: Sweet potato fries were really good, mixed with kimchi (delicious), cheese and mayo. Full of calories but great dish. Mango salad and Wonton soup were good. Chicken with ginger and broccoli was very flavourful, as well. And I really liked their Spicy Ginger Tea with Honey, even though I have to admit it was way too sweet for my taste. And boy, it really is spicy. But it is not easy to find a place with interesting, unique teas (I'm getting tired or regular green or black teas that most restaurants offer). As for the dishes that I did not like: Pad Thai Noodles were so-so. I usually love Pad Thai (PF Changs or most Thai restaurants offer delicious Pad Thai, but this one was a dissaster). I actually sent it back to the kitchen. I think it was the type of noodles they used that I did not like. I am not sure, it just didn't feel right. (They still charged me for the dish, even though I sent it back). Lots of fried dishes, bright red coloring for some chicken dishes, including the Pad Thai I mentioned. There was a dish with beef \"on a bed of spinach\" - but there was no spinach (from AYCE menu). The manager explained that this dish does not come with spinach. Hmmm, okay.. so why is it called \"on a bed of spinach\"? I was looking forward to try their desserts but it was dissapointing. Pumpkin Creme Brule came very watery and small. I was wondering if its a mini version from AYCE menu but no, it was actual size and costs $5. My friend had the same dessert and she did not like it either. It was just very sugary and watery. I also tried their Mini Mousse.. but was not impressed again. I wonder if I'm way too picky or the food is just very average. Note: If you go as a group and only one person wants to order from AYCE menu - it is not possible. The manager explained that everybody has to order AYCE at the table. That is just ridiculous! So should he/she sit at the table next to us, alone?!"}
{"text":"This location is a bit nicer than some, but I noticed they changed their menu and offer fewer options. We used to come here specifically for one gluten-free item but they no longer offer it so our visits will be few and far between. Decent portions and veggies tend to be fresh and non-rubbery. Bathrooms always a little bit desperate."}
{"text":"This location has the dirtiest bathrooms. There - I've said it. For what it's worth, the service is generally fast and they don't overcook the veg. Rising prices and sauce overload are two sticking points that every location seems to suffer from, but you can ask for sauce on the side and split an entree with a friend if you're not extremely hungry. Some problems are not insurmountable.  Look - it's Spring Rolls. I get that it's not \"authentic,\" but they don't seem to pretend otherwise. This place is all about location and patio access - there's not many others in the area outside of the mall. I realize there are plenty of better places further afoot, but this place has subway access, so there's another plus. Now, if they could just clean their bathrooms..."}
{"text":"I can understand why some people on here give this place low ratings for food that isn't entirely \"authentic\" and it IS somewhat pricey, but I've always had excellent service here, and I've been at least 5 or 6 times.  There are not many Asian-style restaurants that include gluten-free options, but Spring Rolls does (although not specified on the menu, the waitstaff are familiar with ingredients). I'm not gluten-intolerant but I often dine out with someone who is, and as much as I might prefer going to other places, most of the better ones don't seem to understand what gluten is, let alone how to omit that ingredient.  I always order my dish with sauce on the side so I can control how much goes in - and add hot sauce for more flavor since most of the sauce choices here are a bit too bland & sweet.   Overall I find this place reliable and it's a good choice when my options are limited. It's not my first choice and it's not gourmet by a long shot but the drinks menu is fun :)"}
{"text":"Dont come here!! Service is too slow. Food is just okay compare to other Cheaper AYCE sushi"}
{"text":"I would not normally go to a chain such as this. Mixing different foods and having an AYCE option is never for me.  I was invited as part of a group here today and was surprised.  They have a regular menu or they give you an AYCE option that is served to you. They offer you (so-called) Japanese food like rolls, tempura, miso soup, etc or pan-Asian fare.  I would not touch so-called sushi and rolls at such a place so stuck with chicken, dumplings, soup and rolls. Those were fine, tasty and not greasy as I had expected.   The restaurant was roomy, service was fast and water was constantly refilled. They have several TVs in there god knows why, but I managed to ignore them.  The waitress and hostess are well put together, cute, presentable and polite. The manager was accommodating and explained everything and welcomed us at the door.  It does get loud in there so be mindful depending on your need. It would be around $25/person"}
{"text":"This restaurant was just plain awful.  It is expensive and it's not really asian food.  It's kind of like white asian fusion food but in a bad way.  The prices are expensive as well.   Total came out to be around $25 for small portions.   The dish that I got was fried beef pieces with onion put on top of a cabbage leaf.  eating it was like eating a bowl of oil.   absolutely awful.  and to add insult to injury, the waiter had the gall to come up to us and tell us that he'd like to get us the bill because the restaurant is extremely busy.  We didn't even ask for the bill!.   Atrocious service coupled with garbage food.    Those who appreciate real asian food will not step inside."}
{"text":"My favourite Spring Rolls location in the city. Deceptively larger than it seems from the outside (and considering this used to be a Hooters), very clean and crisp decor.   As someone who generally sees soup as a waste of time, I am a big ol fan of every soup on the menu. Never have a I tasted a more flavourful broth (their flagrant use of cilantro and chilis in every broth makes for a delicious base that can't fail to impress, regardless of chosen ingredients), and they don't skimp on the chicken/shrimp/veggies etc.   Lunch specials are really reasonable for those on a budget. For $10 you can get a soup and heaping bowl of pad thai. Also now included on both the menu and the lunch special offering is sushi, which looked and sounded both delicious and decently priced, although I can't say I've tried it (yet).   A foodie's paradise, with a menu of book proportions and a dish for every craving. Get off your high horse and turn down your nose - yes, this is a chain. And yes, they make delicious food. Get over it and eat."}
{"text":"I love Spring Rolls....even thought I know they are the same company as EAST - and we all know my feeling on EAST.....  Other then the Yonge and Eglinton location, this is my fave.  It's big enough that it can accommodate larger groups, but small enough to feel intimate.  Their online reservation system is very fast and efficient....and they are very nice in their e-communications.  The food is great, the atmosphere is fun and the location is perfect....there are somethings that need improvement....  *Get Debit!  WTF!!! *Your servers are dense and need a course on customer service *The front entrance needs work as it's very cramped  Over all, Spring Rolls is a great place for a first date, a business lunch or a quick dinner before a movie at the Manulife Centre."}
{"text":"Due to the review and recommendation of my fellow Yelper Adam B. I came to Spring Rolls. Actually while I was getting lost in St. Lawrence Spring Rolls found me. And since it was raining and I needed a place to regroup and let my hair dry the timing couldn't have been more perfect.  At first glance I thought to myself this place seems a bit too trendy chic for me. I like my Asian restaurants a little more down and dirty authentic. With that in mind I decided I would get just one roll and since it was a cold rainy day a bowl of soup was in order.   The Sexy Salad Summer Roll with its smoked salmon, tiger shrimp and California greens rolled up in rice paper was the obvious choice for me and would be a testament to how fresh their fish was. The sauce served along side had a fiery tastiness that only added to the \"sexy' in this spring roll.   As for the soup I went with the Tom Yum Goong which is typically a favorite for me but here it fell flat. The menu description read that it contained tiger shrimp, lemongrass, galangal, lime leaves, mushrooms, chili and lemon juice. Yet as I dove into the soup I discovered sweet cherry tomato halves which caused the soup to have an overall light sweet taste to it not at all spicy like the little chili pepper symbol next to the menu description boasted. Disappointed but still hungry I continued to slurp it up finding a plethora of seasonings hiding out at the bottom of the bowl. I deemed the cause due to me receiving the last of the soup or the bottom of the barrel to be more specific.   There is a reason why this place is called \"Spring Rolls\" because that is exactly what should order if you come here."}
{"text":"I loved this place! While visiting toronto we stopped by for dinner at spring rolls and had a wonderful time. Our waitress was very sweet and very quick! She was very prompt. We ordered from the all you can eat menu, and ordered a bucket of beers to drink. I found that the portions were perfect, just enough but not too much, and everything was wonderfully plated! One dish that I need to rave about was the beef rib platter it came with two large but thin beef ribs, kimchi, edemame and a lovely watermelon/mint salad. The ribs were perfectly cooked, and the salad was AMAZING! I gave my guy a small bite and kept the rest for myself! ;p One item that I did not enjoy was the mango/cream cheese roll. The mango was not ripe and I found it very hard to eat, but I did because I didn't want to be wasteful. For AYCE this should be a number 1 choice for you!"}
{"text":"The food here was awful. No one liked the food that they served. I had to send my food back because the chicken was completely over cooked, and the batter was soggy. There was no flavour to the meal. I asked for salt three times, and no one got it for me. I had to walk over to the hostess stand and ask for salt. The salt made no difference. The food was plain awful. My friends did not like their food either. The waiter came by almost 30 minutes later. I told him that I cannot eat this. He took the food and gave me something else. It was better, but it was not worth the price of the food.  My friends thought that their food was either over cooked or too sweet.  I call this restaurant a Chinese restaurant for white people. No offense to anyone, but you can get better food down the street for less money (literally. Chinatown is down the street.)  I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant no matter which location I am at. There are multiple items that a vegetarian can eat from coconut vegetable soup (my favourite) to rice noodle pad Thai to Mango Salad (another Fave) and more. Most dishes you get to choose whether you have veggies, shrimp, chicken or beef. The food is always fresh and moderately priced. Great place for a date!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there today with two friends.  I ordered Sauteed Szechuan Sauce Chicken (chili bean paste and Chinese five spice with rice).  One of my friends ordered the Authentic Famous Pad Thai with chicken (Thai rice noodles in lime juice, tamarind and tomato sauce, served w/ tofu, egg, roasted peanuts, bean sprouts and coriander).  My other friend ordered Vegetarian Curry Pad Thai (Thai rice noodles in house curry sauce w/ peanuts served w/ tofu, egg, roasted peanuts, bean sprouts and coriander).  The food was good and our server was fun."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I come here so often and my boyfriend loves it here too!! Such a pretty venue, the decor is stunning! I've sat downstairs as well, just gorgeous! Service can be a hit or miss depending who you get and if it's busy when you're there. We always opt for the AYCE menu when we come. The Pad Thai is very yummy,  fried rice is delicious, but the coconut shrimp is our absolute FAVE!! I also enjoy they deep fried cheese dumplings with the raspberry sauce !! So yummy ! The sushi to me has always tasted fresh and our food always comes pretty quick.. They have great little outdoor seating as well.  Definitely one of my favourite sushi places downtown ! Perfect for date nights ;)"}
{"text":"Terrible, slow, forgetful service.  The food was okaaaayyyyyy...i haven't eaten at a Spring Rolls in quite some time, didn't know they had sushi on the menu.   I've never been a fan of their pad thai, so i stuck to the soup and sushi. Both were okay, and there were unlimited refills on pop."}
{"text":"Their beef teriyaki is canton chilli's beef with black bean sauce left out on a kitchen table for 2 days (maybe for your dog), and their tempura is fried in a 50 year old black oragnic waste oil. Thank you."}
{"text":"The food here, 5/5. Soooo good. So good in fact that I'm willing to give the Brampton one another try even though my first visit, I swore would be my last.  My cousin ordered cheese wontons with raspberry sauce and some dim sum stuff (I don't know the name) while I ordered two spicy salmon rolls.  I tried the cheese wontons, they were amazing. I was really impressed with the spicy salmon rolls. They were amazing. Really, really, really good.  Our server kind of ignored us and took forever to get the bill when we were clearly done and trying to get her attention.  I'd definitely go back though. The food was great!"}
{"text":"This is your standard Asian version of pickle barrel. Just like any spring rolls, there is a wide selection of moderate tasting food. It's the perfect place to come to when everyone's in a \"what do you wanna eat?\" \"I dunno, anything is good\" mood.   I've been here several times and their sushi is sub par. Their Other food is sub par too. But nothing is horrible. I did have a deep friend lobster sushi roll once and that was heavy, chewy, and dense. That was probably the worst I've had here.  As for the value, it's not expensive but it's not cheap. If you were to go to a Thai restaurant or Vietnamese restaurant you would get better food for a lot cheaper.   At least the decor and service is not bad.   Again, come here if you don't really have much of an opinion of what you want to eat, but you're craving asian. Don't come here expecting amazing, cheap food."}
{"text":"Not normally a place I'd go to, but I was with very unadventurous family members.   I'll  start off with saying that the service was good and that was about the only redeeming quality.  I ordered the Stir-Fried seafood dish. The seafood and vegetables seemed steamed rather than friend and were dripping in a sauce (the menu said just a touch) that barely had any flavour.   So for the first time in a long time I asked for the meal to take home, not because I was full but because it was so awful. I had to tip the bowl onto the plate about three times in order to get rid of the \"touch\" of sauce. I plan to refry it at home with some much needed spices in order to actually create something palatable."}
{"text":"Been here numerous occasions friendly staff and great food.  GO for the buffet well worth it.  There steamed dumplings is good too."}
{"text":"The place is meh. It's your typical spring roll like any other.   I went here with my sister on a dinner date. We were greeted by the manager who instead of trying to be professional, came off as an A-hole. Instead of asking if we wanted all you can eat he said: \" it's all you can eat $24.99 and both of you have to order. \" he said it in such a harsh and disrespectful manor like we couldn't afford it.   Whatever. He made us wait so he can find us a table when the whole place was empty.   Our waiter was nice though. & the food is meh."}
{"text":"This place is fashionable, but horrible.  I was doing some shopping and needed to feed so I stopped by here to fill my belly since it was lunch and I wanted something light.  I got the duck wraps on a bed of greens.  They were not good.  Not good at all.  The taste was boring and just one or two notches below frozen food.  The greens were fresh and the dressing fine, but after eating two segments of the 4-piece wrap and half the greens I saw it... like a stark black line drawn directly onto reality between me and my lunch...there was a hair in my food.  Oh wait, not one, THREE hairs in my food.    At least I didn't have to pay for my half-eaten half-edible lunch."}
{"text":"Not the best choice. Only been once but that was enough not to go again.   Service is slow at the ayce Food was bland Atmosphere was the only good aspect of this place.   For much cheaper and more importantly tastier food you have much better choices."}
{"text":"With so many restaurants to try in the hood, why go for the typical crappy chain?? If your looking for great Thai food I strongly suggest Lime at Eglinton and Redpath. Worth the 2 min walk!"}
{"text":"VIBE  Not much to discuss. We were on the patio.  The manager needs a course in smiling, warmth and friendliness.  That said, they did comp one part of my very bad, no good, horrible meal. I've been to spring rolls before but this was bad on another level.   I ATE I had the house pad thai with chicken and chicken spring rolls as an appetizer.  For $5 you get three spring rolls, but they way they are presented, it dupes you into thinking you're getting four. Did I mention that two of my chicken spring rolls were vegetarian?   I didn't think it could get worse but it did. As mentioned below the pad thai was pink, gelatinous and cold. Not to mention the turtle's pace of service at lunch time with about 2-3 other tables on the patio.   I spoke up about both dishes and got checked in by the manager who wanted me to verify my complaint. Fine. They comped me on the pad thai but not on the spring rolls.   It was fine. At least they comped some of it. They asked me about three times if we wanted dessert to make up for it or something else on the menu. Why would I want more badly cooked food?   I knew I should have stuck to my old standby, Chipotle, than try something new in this area. I anxiously await the Fresh that will open.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  I \"rolled\" on over to the Starbucks across the street for a banana chocolate chip muffin and latte. I was satisfied. I will never return to Spring Rolls again."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is the most over-rated Thai place i've every been to.  If you're looking for white-washed \"safe\" thai food then this is the place for you, however if you like spice or actual distinct flavours you should probably go somewhere else.  Its not that the food is \"bad\" ... it's just that it's not good.  I've had the pad-thai, the chicken pad-thai and a variety of other noodle dishes which all seem to just be a big clump of bland rice noodles with some veggies thrown on top.  In my opinion, this is \"mandarin\" quality at best... if you want Thai food, google \"Green Mango\" , go to the nearest location and have a much better meal for a similar price."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to get take out from this place. Having walked past the restaurant a couple of times (I was drawn in by the very nice atmosphere) I was excited to see how it would taste.   First off, my friends were ordering again to cash in the 20$ points they had been given after their previous takeout experience had resulted in a late delivery. So I was already pleased to see that they dealt with complaints so efficiently. (The food with this order only took 30mins to deliver.)   We got an assortment of spring rolls, one of their pad tai dishes and a rice dish.  Everyone enjoyed their plates, although no one was wowed. But at least the dishes weren't greasy like so many other Asian restaurants. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised to find my spring rolls crispy, warm, and not soaked in grease (keep in mind that this is was all takeout).   Basically this is the kind of place where you'll get pretty tasty food, but it won't be the most traditional Asian food. More of a western interpretation."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here in my pre-gfree days. The udon noodles were so delicious, and I was usually pleased with anything I chose off the menu. If you have no dietary restrictions, it's a great place for a business lunch. If you do have allergies (such as gluten) there are very few options to be had. The upside is that the servers are fairly knowledgable about what does/doesn't have gluten. I ordered a chicken dish with sweet and sour sauce and pineapple (you know, the bright orange sauce that comes with chicken balls?) and the meal was so coated in the sauce it was all I could taste. Not pleasant at all. I'd recommend staying away from that meal, food allergy or not.  Overall. The food is decent (minus that sweet and sour dish), and the service is a bit slow, but if you can eat what you want, it's still worth a visit or two!"}
{"text":"A few of my coworkers and I came here for lunch during the week; we made a reservation and although we arrived at different times, we were promptly seated at our table.  One thing I did NOT like right off the bat is that they force your table to either go all AYCE or all off the menu. One of the folks with us wasn't sold on the AYCE but the rest of us wanted it so she compromised. I understand the reasoning, they dont' want someone eating off the regular menu eating the AYCE dishes we got, but still... As well, they put a limit on how much you can order at time. With regular AYCE restaurants, you fill out a sheet and it comes out gradually. We were limited to order 3 items each each time the server came by and he made a point of not coming by until we were almost done the first round we ordered. This was annoying.  That being said, I did enjoy the food that this place had. I ordered a bunch of things, cheese wontons (not nearly enough filling to call these a cheese wonton, but still tasty), green dragon rolls (good but missing that trademark dark sauce that makes them extra yummy), a type of banh mi sandwich (single serving size, excellent!), pad thai (awful, far far far too sweet, didn't finish it) and a few other dishes. The table also got an order of the pork and shrimp dumplings (pork ones were very very good, didn't try the shrimp) and some kind of breaded shrimp (okay but the sauce was like a tartar sauce and didn't really work), spicy tuna rolls (okay but nothing special), mango salad (good an refreshing but the mango was not ripe enough). All of it was tasty and freshly made.  Service was fine, our server was slightly annoying with the \"you can do this but you can't do that\" attitude. He did indicate it would take 40-60 minutes for the AYCE lunch but it took us more like an hour and a half to complete lunch. Don't come here if you're on a schedule or have a shorter lunch. Three of us had to call our bosses and tell them we were going to be late when it took forever to get the food out.   At the end, when he took away our plates, he acted as if he was doing us a favor for not charging us for the excess food. This irks the hell out of me - if you have to charge me for uneaten food, then DO SO! I saw the note on the menu, I get it, you don't want food to go to waste. But he had already brought our bills and was clearing up when he made the comment. I told him I didn't like the pad thai and he told me that he didn't like it either, even though its their \"famous\" pad thai.   Overall, a decent place for lunch but only come here if you have time to spare and you're not super hungry, yet. I was VERY hungry when I arrived and the service was far far far too slow for lunchtime. Regular AYCE restaurants are able to hammer dishes out quickly with multiple chefs and lots of servers. This place needs to step up their AYCE game or get out of the AYCE game altogether."}
{"text":"it might just be my taste, but I've pretty much always regretted coming here to eat. all their food is just wayyyyyy to sweet/salty. I can usually finish a few bites feeling okay, but a little less than halfway I would feel that the flavor is way too overwhelming.  again, it could just be me. but I've come here a few times hoping each time I would pick something better or I would be different, but I'm always disappointed. I feel a little more strongly about this because each time, the people I come with feel the same way.  I'm really confused because it seems like they're always busy..so surely some people must like it. it totally baffles me though. all I know is that I won't be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"For those of you giving this place 4 stars or better....WHY? Had to wait 15 minutes for server to show up with our water. This would have been a good time to ask us for drinks but he disappeared quicker than he came. Had to wait another 15 minutes to order. I was ready to leave at this point but my wife asked me to be a little bit more patient. Finally got to order our food and a beer and that was the last we saw of our server until we were ready to leave. Would have been nice to get another beer. Service? ATROCIOUS!!! To top it off he shortchanged me 10 dollars. Not even an apology. His tip? ZERO. And the food? Very FORGETTABLE!!!"}
{"text":"So I decided to try this place again...  They have some new sizzling dishes.  Also $1/ oyster when dining AYCE.  There is only 1 type... Fanny's.  Fair size.  Shucking is not the best... but who cares!  Pleasant surprise and glad I was in company with someone else who enjoys them as much as I do.  The AYCE menu has changed and is less.  Some of my favorites before are no longer listed.  Glad Danny the server was not there.  Stephen our server today was awesome!!!   It was very busy... for a Monday... but he made sure to we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable experience. Quality of food remained high even though I was at the weekend brunch all you can eat. Service was pleasant. Only drawback is that it gets busy and then the speed at which the food gets to you slows down.  Otherwise, options from the menu are pretty good and you just have to make sure you don`t order too many items because they are strict on wasting of food and will charge you for it."}
{"text":"I should have known better than to go here let alone order the pad thai. But the location was not my choice and nothing on the menu or tables around me even looked terribly appetizing so I thought \"surely the pad thai can't be too bad\". It was terrible, bland and bright red. Also very soupy and not a hint of spice. When I sent it back telling the server that it was bland without a hint of spice I was informed in a condescending tone \"pad thai isn't supposed to be spicy\". Interesting. Because in the cooking lessons I took in Thailand I learned that Thai food balances four elements in all dishes-spicy, sweet, sour, salty- i also used chile flakes in my pad thai and for the 4 months I lived there every pad thai dish I ordered had some heat in varying degrees.  This place is a shame and probably gets so much business because of its location. Certainly not food or service.  Spring Rolls: teach your cooks to cook the cuisine you advertise properly and teach your servicing staff some manners."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and decor for Spring Rolls is superb, which is probably the only reason any one would go there. We went on a Friday night and they had live music with this gorgeous guitar and vocal duet. The venue is great.  Food however, is over-priced and not nearly as delicious as many other Asian restaurants in the area. Of course, since Spring Rolls is much more catered to a broader demographic,  I suppose they would have to tone down the flavours.   We had the Pad Thai, the lamb chops, and the sushi rolls. The pad thai was delicious, but then again, who can really make pad thai wrong? The lamb chops, coming in at over 20$, was dry, unappetizing, and unfilling. The sushi rolls were bland and quite unfilling for its high price as well.  My recommendation? Go to actual Asian restaurants and experience better food for cheaper."}
{"text":"The all you can eat lunch special is nice, but understaffed kitchen is a bummer. Took over 40 minutes to get Tue first course and even longer for the rest. Does not for a work lunch."}
{"text":"I used to love Spring Rolls back when it was a hole in the wall kind of place, before it went into expand on every other block. I loved their beef chow mein - my staple. So in the past month, I went back to check out my old favourite after nearly 6 years.   The first time, there was barely any sauce on the noodles, and what there was, was kind of cold.  The second time, there was barely any sauce on the noodles, and what there was, was kind of cold.   I'm sensing a pattern here :|"}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch for the first time in 3 years. I have no idea what happened. This place used to be the go-to place in the Yonge-Dundas area, with some of the best food.  The atmosphere is still great, the wait time is low, service is good, but the food is lower in quality than whatever raccoons dig up from the trash in Regent Park at 2AM. We had chow mein + spicy noodle. Both dishes lacked taste, smell, temperature... or any sign that they were edible."}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare. I did the ayce lunch for $18.99 which was not bad for the price. Food was decent, nothing crazy good to rave about. Selection is big enough so you can try a little of everything.   Service was great, they were quick and always around. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place is just that, \"A-OK\". It's nothing special, but it's a nice, different place to get away from all the Kelsey/Casey/Boston Pizza's.  I have to admit, for years I thought this place JUST had spring rolls, but a couple of years ago my friend brought me to one and I realized they had a massive menu.  I've tried their chicken pad thai and beef pad thai. Both were very flavourful and didn't have stringy weird meat that you sometimes come across. Their beef ho-fun in mushroom soy sauce was amazing--the portions here are huge so I had to force myself to stop eating it and take the rest home or I would've been just too full! They have sushi now which is reasonably priced so I think next time I'll try that.  This location is nice enough, but parking is a drag and the service was great until we waited half an hour to find our waiter to ask for the bill. Bleh. -2."}
{"text":"While I live in Chinatown, I still love to come to Spring Rolls for a North Americanized version of delicious Asian food.  Of late, I've really taken to the \"All You Can Eat Dim Sum and Sushi\" brunches. You heard me right. Dim Sum. AND. SUSHI! The best combination of all you can eat I've ever had. In addition to the delicious range of dim sum and sushi they have, they also have a few of their best noodle/rice dishes as well - great to share, so you can try a bit of everything.   Favorites:  Sui Mi Har Gow  White Tuna Sushi Scallop Sashimi Mango Tango Chicken Chicken and Corn Dumpling Hot & Sour Soup ... the list goes on...  The service for all you can eat is really fast, food starts coming out within 5-10 minutes, and the servers are constantly coming back to top you up.   At $16.99, I'm in all you can eat heaven - and it's so popular that they now have it every day of the week, lunch and dinner!!!"}
{"text":"We came here just before the lunch rush & it was completely empty. We got to choose where we could sit. We decided to do the AYCE brunch/lunch & our food came out fast & fresh.  Tasted really good. Our server was also very punctual & friendly.  I like this location better than the Yonge/Dundas one because it's laid out better & not squished into a small space. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Went back for lunch & the AYCE is a good deal. We had Satay Chicken Skewers, I had some sushi rolls too. The only sushi roll I didn't like was the asparagus roll. It tasted horrible. Anyway it was pretty empty when we got to the restaurant for lunch so service was nice & prompt. Food here is decent though quality could stand to get a little better. One of the rolls had salmon on top that was so paper thin I couldn't even taste the salmon."}
{"text":"Went here with hubby for the all you can eat brunch. It was good. I liked the veggie explosion roll. Our waitress was nice & service was good. I just found the area we sat in a bit squishy. We were seated just inside the door on the first level. You have to go down one flight of stairs to get to the bathrooms which were kind of isolated from the rest of the restaurant. Thought it was a bit of cash grab for the dessert. You have to pay $3.00 extra even if you're sharing a dessert. But other than that I think we got our money's worth."}
{"text":"We ordered take out for our Valentine's Day at home with candlelight. The food was delivered promptly, was fresh & delicious. A tad overpriced though. We ordered the sexy summer salad rolls, veg spring rolls, veg fried rice & some noodles. We really like the rolls. The entree's were good, but not execeptional."}
{"text":"Great food, all you can eat option, not cheap for babies since there is no kids menu."}
{"text":"In a sea of cheap and not so cheerful eatery options that line the Yonge street strip Spring Rolls Go is just another casualty that offers subpar McAsian meals.  Like most people I came in to grab a quick nosh for take-out as I perused the illuminated wall of pictured menu options.  The cashew chicken stir fry with white rice looked pretty good so I placed my order with the counter person who seemed like she barely even had a pulse going.  I was given a coaster and told to wait for my order to be made, and by the time I sat my ass down in the canteen-chic dining area, the stupid coaster started vibrating and lighting up like some novelty dildo from Japan.  What was the point of that!    My stirfry smelled really good and proved very distracting with it's aroma on the subway as the Jabba the Hutt-esque fellow sitting across from me kept leering at my take-out package. Once I got home I was eager to get knee deep into some cashew chicken goodness.  On the ratio of rice to stir fry, it was 50/50, which seemed alright but then there was a LOT of cabbage, very little chicken and tonnes of the goopy sauce.  I was upset to see there was also tonnes of chilis in the stir fry, when the McMenu never mentioned jack shit about no chilis or spiciness (I'm sensitive to spices), I am not feeling love for Spring Rolls at this point.  Spring Rolls your credo reads \" quality without the price, style without the attitude\"  I've read better lines in fortune cookies.    Folks, trust me save your $ and head to Ginger instead."}
{"text":"This is a place where I bring friends when I can't think of anything else. Food isn't the best but the ambience is great. It is trying hard to look upscale at a decent price.   Think of premium seat of Air Canada - for $25 you get an extra leg room - in exit row. Not business class.   Spring Rolls is similar.   For a bit more, you can a nice ambience, decent menu and a good place to relax. But it is not a high end restaurant. Well, average meal is $ 15.  Pad Thais is my favourite. i recommend trying it with Mango salad.   I ordered something with jumbo shrimp and it was a so so. Some items on the menu can be very hot so ask the server before ordering. The last thing you want is to end up in the crowded emergency room complaining some hot curry you have just eaten!   My suggestion? Try it. Besides, a Pad Thai is ONLY 1,300 calories."}
{"text":"I came here late at night almost right before the kitchen closed. Based on my previous disappointing experiences (other yelpers have already talked about that)  with Spring Rolls, I was apprehensive about coming here but I had no choice since the surrounding places were closed.   However, this time i was pleasantly surprised. The sushi combo for 1 had fresh fresh fish cut at 1 inch thick sashimi  with a the rest of the plate at the same quality. The hand roll tasted good the sushi pieces were nicely presented. i'm actually impressed by the quality of the salmon and tuna.   The experience was on par with what I expect from sushi at that price and exceeded my expectations from Spring Rolls. Now only if Spring Rolls could make all their other food items just as good... i can't imagine why it's so difficult to make a decent pad thai when they can make good sushi."}
{"text":"This review is for ACYE only. If you are looking for good authentic food, I would not recommend this place. If you are looking for extensive menu, fun dining with a group/date, nice ambience, and don't mind subpar fusion food I would recommend. The ACYE menu had many items of Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Thai food which made it fun. For appetizers, we tried the sui mai, shrimp dumpling, salt & pepper calamari, honey garlic wings, tempura shrimp, satay chicken skewers, and spring rolls. All were fine although the wings were very plain. They ran out of miso soup so we tried the hot and sour soup. It tasted horrible and odd. The pad thai and red curry were bland also. The Korean kalbi was ok. It was the only dish we ordered twice. The bulgogi beef lacked bulgogi taste. Curry lamb chop was ok. We ordered lots of sashimi (raw salmon, snapper, tuna) and one roll. The sushi roll was poorly made but maybe because it was ACYE. Everything was sloppier (and perhaps less tasty?) for AYCE customers. Their mini cupcake desert is something you buy at the store. Mango cream brulee was pretty lame. Ice cream was ok. Our server was fine; although very busy she tried to get us what we needed when she could. Overall, 2/5 on food and I wouldn't come again. Just good for a one-time experience."}
{"text":"Sorry son! News flash this place tastes good. I'm not some arsehole that gives a flying flip about authenticity. I like shit that tastes good and for a good price. $22 bucks for starter......main and desert is a good deal, I had a dynamite roll....pad Thai with flank steak and tempora cheese cake...oooooh and sapporo pints are 4.99$ and the decor is nice as is the rest of the bcc......if you hate you can lick my left one.... Yah hurrrrrrrrd."}
{"text":"The food was decent, presentation was nice. Beer on Tap was good Sapporo for $5 a pint. My wife and i did the $40 special. 2 starter's app....2 mains... 2 deserts.   We were not disappointed, the atmosphere is really nice as well."}
{"text":"I like to review restaurants.  Why?  Because you're looking at it right now, trying to decide if you should try this place and I hope to offer you insight into my recent experience.  The star system is difficult, I would like to rate it zero stars for the manager response to our complaints, but three stars for the effort our server (Steven) made to improve the experience.  We were a party of six people, we usually enjoy our Spring Roll experience and so, for a welcome home lunch for a fellow employee, we chose this place to celebrate.  The restaurant is well appointed, the tables clean and drinks brought quickly.  Issue 1 (SLOW): we placed an initial order for drinks, calamari and mango salad (1st).  As stated, the drinks arrived quickly so we placed the rest of the order (2nd).  Now, if you are the staff of Spring Rolls, you will remember us, we come in often and we have perfected how we order.  We choose a member of our team (always the same lady) to order for the table.   Thus preventing the server from hearing the order from many different directions.  Some of the food from our 2nd order arrived.  After 40 minutes and several inquiries, we were brought the mango salad followed shortly by the calamari.  Both were cold (great for the salad, not so for the calamari).  Our \"order lady\" returned the calamari and we waited for the next order.  This theme continued for the entire visit, very slow food delivery and constant reminders.  Issue 2 (WRONG): Our group is diverse and therefore we have some dietary concerns, one member of our team does not eat chicken, unless it is Halal.  We ordered vegetable spring rolls.  Only after eating the spring rolls, did we discover they were in fact Chicken Spring Rolls.  The person thought they tasted differently, but with tofu, you never know.  We returned these to the kitchen.  Issue 3 (MANAGEMENT): We asked to speak to a manager.  When Rita came over, we voiced our concerns.  No one talked all at once, we remained polite, however the managers' response to our issue was \"we are busy\".  Wait a minute?  Really?  (Yes, I am inserting a wee bit of sarcasm here).  But this is a restaurant.  Restaurants want to be busy.  In fact, they should plan their schedule around their busy periods.  Fridays are ALWAYS busy here.  A Friday before the long weekend?  Extra busy, in fact we know this, we've come on a similar Friday before.  But to excuse this with \"we are busy\"?  Our \"order lady\" was having none of that.  She stated that being busy, for a restaurant, is never an excuse for a bad experience.  We didn't get an actually apology until later.  Too little, too late.  The last insult?  The mandatory tip that Spring Rolls includes on the bill.  Will we come back here?  Not sure, but in the hour since we've been back at work, we've started telling everyone about our experience."}
{"text":"We took a group out from the office for a goodbye lunch for a colleague and decided to  go to Spring Rolls.  Normally we go to the Spring Rolls at Yonge and Dundas but for some reason we decided to try to location on Front Street--what a mistake.    When we arrived the host seemed to be confused about where we were sitting.  After a lengthy wait and discussion they decided that we were sitting downstairs.  As we descended the stairwell you could already smell the bathrooms--the stench filled the basement.  We sit down at the table and the hostess tells us about the \"All You Can Eat Special\" for $14.99 per person.  We all agreed to the special. I will spare you the all of the details but suffice it to say that they provided very little food and what they did bring was not up to the standard of my previous experiences at other Spring Rolls locations.    There was only one full-time staff in the basement so there were huge waits in-between courses.  In short it took her 2 hours just to bring out the 3 courses so there was no possibility of ordering more than 1 serving since you are required to finish within 2 hours.  All You Can Eat?  Methinks not.  I ordered 1 9 oz. glass of wine and all together my tab was nearly $30! (including a mandatory 15% tip!)  What I received was certainly not worth $30 in either quantity or quality.  This was a total rip-off and the worse restaurant experience I have had in Toronto in quite sometime.  I don't think I will ever visit the Front Street location ever again."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer and had been frequenting this location since it opened and have generally been a fan of the food and price point (if not the service). The service has generally been substandard but passable in the past. Not so today.   This restaurant has recently been renovated and it has a nice patio right on Dundas Street. The menu has been revamped with pictures of almost all of the dishes now available. They have added sushi items to the menu. The prices have also been increased. This would not bother me so much if the food quality and portion size remained as good as before but that was not my experience today.   I love the Tom Yum soup and they used to have a meal sized portion on the menu. When they took it off the menu, the kitchen would continue to make it for me upon request. It has shrimp and lots of veggies (I usually skip the noodles) and large pieces of fried tofu. Today, the portion size was smaller and they charged me $2 extra for the tofu. The soup came to $14! It was lukewarm and had large pieces of whole baby bok choy which as impossible to eat with a spoon. I was not impressed.   The service was abysmal today. Our waitress didn't know what the cost of the full size soup would be and promised to let us know but failed to do so.  We waited forever for our food and after she brought it, she did not come around again.  We had to ask for our bill several times.   There are better choices for Thai dining in this in this neighbourhood.   I learned to make my own Tom Yum soup several years ago and mine is much better anyway.     I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls restaurant has fantastic food and great service. I especially love their Tasting Menu."}
{"text":"Not good The food is just so so but rather expensive for what it is Ripped us off and billed us for 2 dishes that we didn't even order or receive!  Our fault for not catching this on our bill until we got home but overall this \"error\" created a horrible experience at Spring Rolls Dundas location Inattentive attitude of the staff  I will definitely not be back!"}
{"text":"If only I could give 0 stars! The worst place I have ever been the food actually make me sick to my stomach! I don't ever remember their food being deep fried but everything I ordered was deep fried when it suppose to be stir fry? Don't even get me started on their sashimi I was giving eggs and fake carb and 3 tiny pc of salmon and tuna when I asked why is it like that my server told me oh it's chefs choice so everytime it's different! I mean if u r going to charge people $17 and decided to serve Japanese food than actually serve what u r suppose to be I have been to lots of sushi places and I have never got that before! So I got the Mongolian beef and it was disgusting it is basically fried batter with beef jerky soaked in oil and sugar it was horrible I have never had a dish like that its funny because in the picture it clearly does not look like that what a nightmare! One last thing it was all u can eat but no one told me anything until I realized that all the people is having the all u can eat I mean if u r going to advertise that than u should make sure all ur staff is on board and letting all the customer know. This was horrible and I will never return there again!"}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend brought home spring rolls for dinner. I ordered har gow, Cantonese chow mein (sans pork & squid) and a strawberry passion fruit smoothie. My boyfriend ordered mango salad and some kind of fried rice with chicken.  My food was good, it actually tasted better the next day after my noodles absorbed the gravy and list some of the crunch. The shrimps were nice and meaty. I loved the idea of serving har gow with Siracha and mustard instead of soya. Yummy! My smoothie was a bit too sweet but good enough to finish.   I wondered why my boyfriend ordered rice as a meal (it's always been my opinion that rice is a side dish) but I was wrong. This fried rice was flavourful! It could honestly stand on its own I kept eating out his container when he walked away *evil grin*. I liked the fact that they go salad had long strips of mango almost looked like noodles. Very fresh flavours! Overall I enjoyed my meal. I want to go for the all you can eat."}
{"text":"I feel bad giving 1 stars but honestly, I can only think of the words \"blah, yuck, and omg what was that?!?!\" when I recall the business lunch we had here with my office mates.  For $15, you can have AYCE in a semi clean space that tries to be modern, hip, and tasty but unfortunately falls short on all 3 counts.  At first I thought 2 hours for lunch seemed excessive for an AYCE but I now understand why.  The food takes FOREVER to arrive and sadly, half the order arrives missing or wrong or worst... cold and wrong.  I tried to order the seaweed salad to start,  chinese 'greens' with oyster sauce, thai green curry with shrimp, spicy tuna roll, and a few salmon sushi pieces.  I got a garden salad, the saddest looking veggies in brown gloopy sauce, green chicken curry and a spicy salmon roll.  LOL... I never got my ordered fixed because it would have exceeded the 2 hours!  Anyhow, aside from the worst ordering experience, the food quality was no better.  The garden salad was showing wilted brown looking edges.  I told them that I didnt' want it and they shouldn't charge me full price because I'm not eating rotting food.  It took me 3 tries to get the manager to come over and have that removed off my order.  The chinese 'greens' were essentially frozen vegetables stir fried with heavily corn starched oyster and soy sauce.  I think the last time I seen something glisten this much was my shellac manicure.  The green chicken curry didn't come with any vegetables ... it just came with pieces of chicken in a very heavy green curry sauce.  It was ok but it tasted something out of a food court.  As for the spicy salmon roll, I felt bad for the fish because it looks like it was not only diced ... but smeared into a paste and then added chilli mayo.  It was not appetizing at all.  The texture was like toothpaste.  The restaurant itself is showing a lot of wear.  The floors weren't super clean as it had pieces of food on the floor from the previous diners.  The chairs were wobbly and so were some of the tables.  Overall, it felt like a poorly run restaurant.    If you're looking for an AYCE experience in Mississauga, try 168 sushi, sushi sushi, or even Yangs for a better experience.  This place just missed the mark on so many things that I don't think it can recover.  I'm really quite startled to see any positive reviews on this place."}
{"text":"Should have read the reviews before coming here.   I was in a hurry and needed to EAT AND RUN. This place looked like a good option. Food was cheap ($5.99 for most meals).  It's totally cafeteria style. Even though I was the only one in the place at 4:30pm, I had to take a buzzer thing back to my table and go and collect my tray when the food was ready. Like one of the 6 staff people working could not be arsed to walk 10 feet to my table? Geez!  My soup (udon with bbq pork and shrimp) came out in a plastic disposable bowl with shrink-wrap on the top. WTF. It was also scathingly hot, I was trying to eat quickly and it burnt my mouth. The only cutlery to be found is cheap disposable chopsticks and a plastic spoon that was nearly melted by the boiling broth.  Cheap and ghetto."}
{"text":"I knew this was going to be a horrible experience before I even arrived, mainly because I loathe chain restaurants, but some friends from the 905 were visiting and this was their food pick before our movie night.  I don't want to go into detail, but really, the food is SH!TE. We had the All You Can Eat dinner for $24.99 and after sampling 15 different things, there were only 1-2 that were even tasty.   The dim sum was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten. The har gow was a bit chewy mass of dough, shu mai was bland and gross looking. The sushi was mediocre and the sashimi I ordered (5 pieces) were laughably small and took about 20 minutes to arrive at the table. The various stir fries and thai food all tasted as if they had been reheated by microwave or prepared from frozen or something.  The service was hit and miss too - our server came by often, but they kept forgetting things, and it took us AGES to get out of there and pay."}
{"text":"We've been to spring rolls a few times. Twice at this location and once at one at another location. This would be my favourite location. It was amazing value I'd say. We loved the sushi and Creme brulee. Love how they bring the food to you and prepare the food as you order. There is quite a selection of savoury dishes as well as desserts to choose from. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I used to go to SR a lot when they first started opening locations a number of years ago. Came back a few weeks ago to the Fairview location with my cousins and actually really enjoyed it. The prices are great and the food selection is enormous! I ordered the seaweed salad, edamame and veggie sushi roll. Everything was fresh with big portions. I am happy I came back as I would definitly return in the future! Good customer service too and it was a Sunday so it wasn't so busy. Fast service."}
{"text":"I visited Spring Rolls at this \"new\" location and it was not all that amazing. I too have been to another location (Yonge and Eglington where Hooters used to be) and the food was much better. Anyway, the prices were I guess average at $5 for 2 spring rolls and $8-10 for entrees. You can either get your meal or eat family style. Don't come hungry, because you might leave hungry.   I give one additional star for the decoration. The look is basic, but there are a lot of subtle accents that make you feel like you might have 4 star experience. This place is like that guy that talks a big game, but all that comes out in the end is air."}
{"text":"I went tonight to this location for the first time with my husband. And we were so disappointed about it. We asked to the server about the all you can eat menu and he said that he could bring it to us because the last call was at 10:30, but at the moment that we asked for it was 10:20.... We told him that we still had 10 min to order and we could order everything at once but he said no again. Then we asked the same to another server and he said \" you have to ask to your server because I'm off\" but he was stilling working at the moment..... I felt like this people doesn't want to work at all and to be honest if I'm going to spend money to eat outside I'm expecting to receive a good service because I work like a server also!!!... In conclusion, we just left and went to Moxie's which is just next to it."}
{"text":"I love this place, this location particular, friendly service, food were grest, love their hot and sour soup and theur famous chicken pad tai.  Worth a repeat."}
{"text":"I don't come here by choice but it's not bad here. Servers are very attentive and helpful. They definitely cater to your dietary needs and any allergies you may have. As for food, I never know what to get when I go here. My go-to is the vegetable roll with sweet potato and asparagus. The roll is large and very filling however it is served differently every time. Once it came with a side of mango salad on the plate and the most recent time it was a bit bland with no salad. Mini cupcakes for dessert were moist and delicious. Good service, food is average, nice decor."}
{"text":"Out of all he spring rolls I've been to this is the smallest and oddest one. The food was hit or miss, which is odd as all the other locations I've been to were delicious and fresh, the food here was prepped differently and was displeasing either in texture of flavour, half he dishes were spot on but the other half we normally order seemed to be vulgar to at least two or three of our senses. Staff was nice but kept skipping past tables and there was maybe six tables tops at the time. Was a friendly experience but I think I'll stick to another location for now as the standards are much better at other Spring Rolls. Could have been an off day but it was still disappointing."}
{"text":"Came by today around 1pm to try the AYCE menu. Was seated promptly. Got fed up waiting for a waiter, so we flagged one down after 15mins. Judging from the slow service and lack of acknowledgement, we decided to order from the regular menu instead. AYCE would've taken forever. I'll just order 'to go' from now on."}
{"text":"No big fancy review from me this time, just the simple plain facts.  Decor: This is super fancy and upscale looking place. Location: The location in the office building and taking up 2 levels makes it real convenient for the PATH folks and the tenants alike to enjoy a nice place. Drinks: No booze for me this time, so good ol POP. Service:  The waitress was really attentive and had the patience of a superstar.  Having to work with the biggest group of undecideds (us) really showed her skills. Food: I ordered beef chow ming.  I really enjoyed my food.  The white rice was really good and sticky.  The biggest winner here is they CAN cook without MSG and that is what really sold us in going here.  Short and sweet review, nice and enjoyable time."}
{"text":"This location is 100x better than the Erin Mills location.  There place is nicer, newer, much larger, with more open seating and nice decor.  The service here is fine, and the food quality and overall experience were great.  My only complaint is that it is a bit pricey for what you get.    I would recommend this place to anyone new to Thai food, or asian food in general.   Derek"}
{"text":"Sushi was amongst the most bland I have eaten. Thai curry was lacklustre. Hot and sour soup was so-so. Wine selection was not good. The only thing to recommend this place was the ambience. Service was also average."}
{"text":"Was visiting from the States with colleagues and went here for dinner.  We ordered individual entrees (I had the shrimp and chicken pad thai) and then we ordered a large plate of sushi to share with the table.  The pad thai was very good and the sushi was excellent.  Also, the sushi was a really good value, we got 12 pieces (tuna, salmon, eel) for $15 (ca) which i thought was a great price.  Service was very friendly.  The restaurant was very nicely decorated and very quiet for having so many people eating which was nice so we could talk casually.  Great value and great food in a great setting!"}
{"text":"Okay, I know, it's a chain. And a mixes culture chain even worse, I should have known better. But, I was desperate and needed a place that delivered. Big mistake. First of all, the only reason I even considered it was because I had a vague memory of how amazing it was when I had it at the Aurora location. Oops - that would be THAI Spring Rolls, an entirely different place, and rightfully deserving the 4.5 star rating. Spring Rolls on the other hand is DISGUSTING. Red Thai Curry is tasteless, too spicy, and entirely bland with mushy rice and dried up, fried, spongy tofu. Chicken with veg and cashew is quite literally 'a cashew', not plural. Sauce is thick and uninspiring. Sexy summer rolls should be renamed 'lettuce rolls' as that's all that seems to be in them (note, these are the non-fried option). Needless to say, I am thoroughly disappointed, even having low expectations to begin with. Never. Again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and although I wasn't a big fan of the service the first time,  the second time round I found it to be amazing.   Our waiter was simply great,  he explained to us what the dishes we were interested in consisted of very nicely and made sure that we had everything we needed.   I was very impressed with the service this time.   As for the food,  it was great and aesthetically pleasing.  Overall,  it was a good lunch. One thing I wish they had was more variety in their dessert menu."}
{"text":"I mean, this place apparently gets pretty rave reviews, but I was not very impressed.  This could partly be because of the fact that I was spoiled with Thai food in Boston, MA, but then again, I've had Thai food all over and this place does not impress.  The problem with this restaurant is that it diversifies its menu into too many areas, serving anything from Thai food, to Chinese, to Viet, to even Korean food.  All I wanted was some Pad See You, which is what I would expect to a place that is termed the \"best Thai\" in Toronto.  Nope.  I ended up getting the Korean Kalbi, which was okay, but I can't say it compared to any other Korean I had.  Prices were okay, but probably a bit overpriced, and not authentic at all.  Service was okay."}
{"text":"We would visit the downtown location and the Mississauga location quite often and loved their food. Recently I have noticed at this location that the food is just O.K. I don't know if they have gone down in quality or what, but it doesn't taste the same. Maybe locations do matter.   In any case, I did not like their service because it's so inconsistent. Some days you will get lucky and have the best server and some days, good luck! We visited for lunch one day and they had their special lunch menu. The food again was just O.K. It didn't hit the spot and it didn't taste like it once used to.   What happened? I don't know."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and the food. BUT...this location was my worst experience.   So I visited this location while walking around Eaton Center in the downtown area. It was lunch time and we wanted to go to one of our favorite restaurants. We ended up at this location and sat down to order our meals. The waiter came to our table to take our orders. My husband made his order while he pointed out the order on the menu and the waiter agreed and left. When the food came out, my dish was in order but my husbands dish was completely wrong. We called the waiter back and spoke with him telling him that he made a mistake. Now, get this, the waiter...wait for it...started arguing with us blaming my husband that he ordered that dish that was on the table. My husband politely kept refusing saying that he ordered another dish and pointed at the dish he wanted on the menu. The waiter kept getting ruder and argued back with a harsh tone blaming my husband that he ordered the dish on the table. Frustrated and surprised, I asked the waiter to take the dish back and call the manager. When the manager came, to our surprise, he didn't even show any sort of care or professionalism to work this mess out. Even more frustrated now, we asked them to charge us for the drinks we ordered and let us pay and leave. Get this...they agreed and made us pay for the drinks. This restaurant and manager did not care to rectify the issue or work at fixing it. He didn't even seem interested in making the customers happy. It was the worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant. By far, the worst manager and worst location for this chain. Sad!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant and this location is also our favorite. We have never had any issues with this location.  My wife and I visited this place at least twice a month if not more. The food along with the atmosphere is great. Located right next to Square One Shopping Mall, that makes this restaurant a prime location for eating out after a day of shopping.   Firstly, the decor and ambiance of this location is great. It gives a sense of classy to the location. It could be good for a date, a business meeting, or even a birthday dinner.   Secondly, the food is great. Spring Rolls has some of the best Har-Gow that I have ever had. Their hot sauce and mustard that comes with the Har-Gow is deliciously mixed and perfected. We have had quite a few dishes and every single one of them was delicious and tasty.   Thirdly, the staff along with the manager are friendly and professional. Once, they didn't make my drink properly and I made them change it twice before they got it perfect. The manager came out and spoke with us and asked us if everything was okay and as we wanted it. That alone, would make anyone go back.  In the end, a great restaurant with many options for everyone out there with a whole lot of taste!"}
{"text":"After wandering around Yonge and Dundas for a while, we finally decided that Spring Rolls would get our business as we wanted something other than Pickle Barrel or Red Lobster at Atrium on Bay.   After getting our menus everything on it seemed predictable, but not as much variety as we were hoping it would be. We really wanted Salmon, but it looked like it was only available as a dish with spicy pad thai noodles under Chef Specialities. We were told we could substitute it with rice, but if we did that I don't think we would have gotten our money's worth for doing so. Eventually we settled on short ribs, and a steak both from the Chef Specialities section.   While waiting for our food we sat at our table, which ended up being the one right by the door so when people walk in from the street we are the first people they see. It was a little weird at first but there is a glass partition separating us from strangers, we got used to it. While talking with my girlfriend we noticed we had to speak up more than usual just to communicate over the table. It was quite loud for a smaller area but there are larger sectional tables near the front where larger groups could eat at. Either way it was loud enough that I downloaded a decibel app on my phone just to see how loud it was: 88db was the average. By the end of the meal I was ready to leave just to give my ears a break.   The food itself was exactly how we were expecting it. I can fully recommend the Short Ribs and the 8 oz Steak, very savoury with their Teriyaki sauce, both served with white rice. I asked for Medium Rare, and for the most part it was but it was interesting to see that depending on the part of the steak, it wasn't cooked evenly but it was still delicious. Cooked properly too, seared on it's back so the fat cooks properly. Too bad it wasn't quite all the way through but I didn't mind. The only problem with the Short Ribs was there wasn't enough of them, but the lack in quantity is made up with the flavour and the skewer of shrimp and onions.   Another thing I didn't like about the plating is the food is served in exaggerated plate/bowls. I found it difficult to cut a steak properly and fully appreciate it in a bowl rather than on a plate. I could tell my girlfriend was having the same issue with her short ribs. A little too much garnish on the dishes too, a small green salad and a leaf of kale. I couldn't figure out if we should eat it, or if it was meant to just be garnish. Overall I had a great meal, I rate it a 3 as it was almost everything I was expecting for this price range."}
{"text":"I had eaten at the Spring Rolls up at Yonge and Eglinton and enjoyed it. Tried the one on Yonge and although the staff was friendly and welcoming the food was disappointing. I ordered a fried rice dish that was so bland. And on top of that, the vegetables were frozen! The type that comes in a frozen bag with the corn, green beans and peas mix where the beans are perfectly cut in the same shape! I get the restaurants use frozen vegetables at times, but using the frozen vegetable mix is pretty bad. Especially with all that fancy decor and upscale ambience. I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"Service was good but pad Thai was that girlfriend ordered was very disappointing. I frequent the one in Brampton and on Front St so I do like the chain."}
{"text":"I attended this location for the first time with a small group of four.   The hostess was very pleasant and we managed to be seated within minutes of our arrival considering it was pretty busy.  After much deliberation we decided to go with the AYCE dinner at basically $24.00 per person. We were a hungry crowd.  We ordered soups such as, Wonton, Tom Yum, and seafood miso. Meh they were OK. We ordered a variety of sushi dishes which included; California rolls, cucumber roll, and \"Virgin sunset roll\" (LOL) made me laugh how can a sushi dish be a virgin? Anyway....  We had some Hak Gow shrimp from the dim sum menu which I thought was meh very bland. The chicken pad Thai seemed very salty to me. The seaweed salad was quite tasty. The shrimp Tornado's were Yummy!  All in all I would say that this place must be over rated compared to many of the Asian dishes I have tried in the City or in Markham at a fraction of the price.  I must say the staff was excellent and very pleasant!!!! The decor was OK. It was a bit noisy for my taste.   Would I go again? Ummm NO! Loved the staff the food was so so."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  Firstly, the spring rolls are great - it's in their name so it has to be good.  And the pad thai is amazing.  I've had it at other places, but no where is as good as Spring Rolls.  It's tasty and the portions are huge.    On some nights they have live music, which is really great unless you are sitting right in front of them and it's a little hard to hear the people you are with.  The staff was really helpful and found us a seat a little further away.  When the musicians are not on top of you, you can really enjoy the music.    I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Yikes! I heard this place was popular so i stopped in a for a late lunch, and what I got made me want to give up Thai food forever. I started with the Sui Mai dumplings. It was sub par, nothing great. Then I had the chicken pad thai, and what i got were reddish noodles and chunks of tofu, along with the chicken and veggies. I was confused and turned off by the color. I've eaten pad thai at many different places and had never seen it that color or prepared that way before. The waitress explained that the red color is from tomato sauce. What?!! It tasted as awful as it looked. They also left out or don't use ground peanuts or eggs in their recipe. I give it one point for the friendly server."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon for a AYCE sushi lunch. The sushi was on par with any typical sushi takeout trays you find at local Asian supermarkets. Our waiter was just awful. He was apathetic throughout our dining experience. He didn't smile once nor acknowledge our presence. He made it seem like it was a chore to take our orders and sighed after we asked to have separate bills.   3/5 for the average sushi 1/5 for the staff   Note to management: please train your staff to be at least a little attentive towards its customers    Don't think I'll be visiting this restaurant any time soon"}
{"text":"This was one of the first restaurants I tried when I moved downtown.  I went for a friend's birthday.  The waitress was really friendly and the group of us had alot of fun with her.  The food was really good though it took a little while to get it.  I wouldn't say this is my favorite place to go but I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"After being to the full restaurant next door I thought I would pop in to have lunch at Go.  The quality of the food compared to the restaurant isn't even possible.  I agree with Jen's comment about this being a food court style place.  The good things I can say is that the staff is quick and friendly and the prices are fair."}
{"text":"I don't know that SR is anything special. This one is located at bay atrium, across from Eaton/Canadian Tire/Ryerson school of management, so after a meeting we called a half hour in advance to ask if there was room for a party of 9. They said yes and no wait list so we headed over.  When we arrived, not only did we wait half an hour, by the time a table opened up it could only seat 6-8 people so we lost two guests who went off to look for somewhere else to eat!! Bad start!  The food was ok. Some of the items ordered:  Vegetable spring rolls Tiger shrimp rolls  Chicken Pad Thai Lamb rack Tenderloin with rice, veggies & Coconut curry  Sushi and sashimi  Everything tastes good to us. We were a fussy group and our waitress helped with suggestions and substitutions.   The spring rolls were surprisingly small and tasteless. That's the name of the joint, I expected to be wowed.   The curry sauces are great and you can ask for extra! And heat if you wish.   I RECOMMEND:  Chloe! She is an exceptional waitress! Thanks for the great service ;)   The lamb and steak dishes were most popular with our group.   EXTRA TIP:  Free Yelp dessert! Deep fried banana with mango, vanilla, or green tea ice cream--- huge portion, I warn you, so be prepared to share and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Spring Rolls at this location for the past 5 years, and I never leave disappointed. The only downside was when they changed their menu 2 or 3 years back, which resulted in them reducing the number of options in the menu including eliminating some of my favourites. But on the plus side, this change did come with an increase in the number of vegetarian options. The decor is beautiful and makes you feel like you are eating at a really high scale restaurant despite the prices being very affordable, along with generous food portion sizes.  They have excellent cocktails too. Their service is friendly and efficient. Even though this place gets pretty busy, especially on weekend nights, you will never be waiting for a table as its quite large. The food is made to suit all tastebuds, whereby nothing is too strong with flavours/spice. So, if you're looking for simple asian food, or if you are contemplating between Japanese or thai food, then you should definitely consider Spring Rolls as they have both."}
{"text":"Spring Rolls in Fairview Mall has one of the prettiest patios I seen... at least up in this area near Fairview Mall. It is so pretty during the summer with all the flowers in full bloom! There are also loungers for you to have a drink on the patio.   The interior is decorated in dark colours are also very chic and modern. Tables are set far apart and you never feel crowded.  OK... 5 stars for patio, 4 stars for interior deco and 2 stars for food.  I do understand that Spring Rolls is NOT authentic Thai/Vietnamese restaurant. A lot of the food does taste really bland without the spiciness.   Dropped by for lunch. Yes they do have a different lunch menu everyday. However, the prices are similar to the regular menu the only extra is the complimentary house salad. And it is really not worth your while to eat that house salad. Since it is just like package salad with kraft salad dressing.. nothing Asian about that! And even the salad is not fresh!  The Malaysian style  udon noodle with house made XO sauce ($8.99) which is on the lunch menu is totally not memorable. It is more like noodle stir-fried in soya sauce.... And the portion seems to be noticable smaller than the regular menu item which some other people ordered next to me.  However, it is good news because when it is not good.. what point of having so much of something not so good?? I now have room for dessert. Blame it on the people next to me, they ordered dessert the Fried Banana with ice cream is huge with 3 bananas and 2 scoop of ice cream.. which I don't think I can finish. I decided on the Mango with Sticy Rice ($4.95).   I have to say the dessert save the 2 star rating for food! My dessert look awhile to arrive, but it is nice and hot... and it stayed that way to the last bite! Usually some places will served me lukewarm sticky rice and got hardened when I ate half of it because they put it in the microwave to heat it up. But the sticky rice here has no issue at all. The mango though is small... a thin slice.... I am quite happy eating the rice with the coconut milk dressing!  Looking at their drink menu, they do have specials during lunch even for drinks.. that is so tempting.. but the drinks prices all seems reasonable.. $7 for a Martini... I think I want to come back to have a Martini on the patio's lounger on a hot summer night with...........  They accepts all credit cards!"}
{"text":"Met up here with a few friends of mine for dinner and I was not disappointed.  The place was almost full and thankfully we got a seat for 7. Both the food and service were awesome! The servers were very attentive and does not pays attention unlike other places when busy.   I started with the Calamari which I am always scared to order at restaurants because you never know if they will come out oily and soggy.  I was amazed when the server brought out the dish and it was perfect! It was hot and crunchy outside and nice and tender inside! Not oily/soggy/rubbery!!!! which is a bonus!  I then had a Chicken and Shrimp Pad Thai which is one of my favorites and I was not disappointed!  I would definately recommend this place and will be returning!"}
{"text":"Spring Rolls is just not doing it. They're not doing Asian food, they're not doing Thai food, they're not doing anything substantial or worth eating.  Their Pad Thai is dry and pasty, their curries are filled with fatty meat and mostly cabbage (Really? Are vegetables that expensive?), and their Chinese dishes are so bland it doesn't make sense.  This location of Spring Rolls is always busy, no matter what the time, because of the central location. When I was in school, I'd sometimes stop by their takeout window and order food to go, food that I always thought would be better the next time round.   Nope. not yet. Spring Rolls cuts too many corners to have good food, and they're laughing because Canada hasn't had Yelp to tell them otherwise. Well, now they do. Beware to anyone visiting Toronto -- we do have good Thai restaurants! Spring Rolls is not one of them."}
{"text":"Have you ever been up late at night, restless, wondering \"what would Asian food made by Rush Limbaugh taste like\"?    Wonder no more: visit Spring Rolls, where the melting pot of ethnic cuisine is a big ugly deep fryer.    Actually, take the $60 you were going to spend on dinner at Spring Rolls and use half of it for twice the food at the Dumpling House in Chinatown.  You can use the rest of your money to pay some chump off the street $30 to eat at Spring Rolls while you laugh at them.  AND YOU WILL LAUGH."}
{"text":"The service was very disappointing. A group of us (8 people) sat around the table for over 10 minutes without menus or water, or any kind of attention. Food was delivered very slow as well, probably a good 30 minutes wait. The restaurant is severely under staffed. I checked in on Yelp to get the free fried banana icecram, but the staff told me that he never heard of it and it is for dinner only - I don't know if he invented on the spot, but I don't see any fine print saying so. The pad Thai quantity was good, but it tasted too sour. I was dragged to this place and it turned out to be that I am right. I would not return to it again."}
{"text":"We had reservations for a birthday with a lot of people. Hats off to them for doing a great job with service! They brought our food promptly and were quite attentive. We occupied half the tables downstairs. I think they reserve their lower dining area for peak times like dinner or for large parties. However, be warned that you might get split up based on if you're ordering AYCE or a la carte.  This is mostly a review of their AYCE menu, although most of the items can probably be found on their regular menu. Some yummy appetizers are Satay Chicken skewers, Salt and Pepper Calimari, Coconut Shrimp, and the sauced Chicken Wings. Their Sashimi was ok but didn't taste the freshest. Their rolls were quite good. Make sure you don't fill up and be sure you try the sizzling Korean Kalbi hot plate which was amazing! To finish I enjoyed the pumpkin creme brûlée (limited time), vanilla and coffee mini desserts. Avoid the curry at all costs it tasted like a watered down mess!  Overall, this is great if you need a place to accommodate a large number of people with a semi-decent selection. They've changed up their AYCE menu. From what I remember they had the basic necessities covered (salad, miso soup, etc.) but have now included some decent platters and entrees to their sushi. However, if you want to explore some adventurous flavors then I'd consider other options in the area."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand why everyone is giving such bad reviews this is by far the best quality sushi for ayce in the greater toronto area. Sushi rolls are delicious even though they are standard rolls and they have lots of variety on the menu. Can't complain I was happy with their service and food. Drinks should really be included though especially the green tea which is overly priced."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  On our way to see a show at the Panasonic Theatre, we opted for this restaurant as it was very close to the venue, plus I've been to other Spring Rolls locations and have never had any issues.   I made reservations for 8 ppl and when we arrived our table was ready. We were ferried up to the 2nd floor, where larger groups are consigned to. We were, at that time, the only table up there. Shortly after we were seated, a larger group of at least 20 ppl arrived. Realizing that if they ordered before us our food would take ages to come out, we asked the waiter if we could order (plus we had to get to the theatre for 7:30pm). He took our selections and rather than punching it in, went to the larger group and took their order as well. By the time our order was punched in, it was 15 minutes after we had placed it, as he had to explain several dishes to the other table. We ordered our food at 6:20pm.....it didn't come out until well after 7pm.  As you guessed, the larger groups food came out first......we were left waiting while items were placed on their tables and our server focused all his energies on running up and down the stairs to bring up their food. He kept telling us that our food \"would be arriving shortly\", but we were virtually ignored, with an empty bottle of wine, empty glasses and empty appetizer plate still on our table.  When our meals did arrive, the food was blah. It had evidently been prepared at the same time as the other tables and sat on a counter waiting to be brought up.  One persons meal was cold...not left on the counter cold, but just came out of a fridge cold. Another's was luke warm (Mongolian beef), my meal was ok to eat, but would have tasted much better had it been hot (I had cashew chicken, which I've had at other Spring Rolls and it is usually piping hot...and here it was essence of chicken, with lots of veggies). One of our group had sweet potatoe fries, that was mixed with kimchi and cheese....she said it was amazing and from speaking to others, was the only meal that tasted good. 7 people out of 8 not happy with their food quality does not a great impression make. Even the person who had a Caesar Salad said it was awful.   To be fair, our server was working his ass off....he went from an empty section, to having 28 people (all within the span of 10 minutes), and someone did eventually come to help him....but it definitely impacted our visit.  Based on this experience, I might be willing to give them another try, but most likely would go somewhere else if in the area."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times, and they've changed their menu 2-3 times since I started going there. This is absolutely not a true sushi experience food wise. During the busy times, they PACK on the rice on your sushi orders. What a disgrace to sushi. I have to scrape off extra rice from time to time- but I keep on coming back, continuously giving this place the benefit of doubt that I won't keep experiencing terrible food, until today.  A host immediately greeted me and sat me down (only reason they got 2 stars) but as I sat there for 10 minutes, 4 waiters/waitresses walking by me, no one waited me. No one spoke to me. I didn't get any drinks and I was ready to order as I sat there patiently waiting for someone to take my order. Well no one came, so I got up and walked out to the mall and had some fast food inside the mall instead.  This place used to be my favourite, but now it is just utter trash. The food quality has gone down, the menu is garbage and the service is horrendously slow nowadays. Going here is like playing Russian roulette. You will either get good food, okay food, or just bad food.  If you want a true all you can eat experience with excellent sushi, go to Tokyo Maki beside Shoppers World. If you want to fine dine, go to Sushi House in downtown Brampton.   I love sushi, sad to say this place has completely gone down hill. (Even the one in Toronto as well.)  Don't let the decor of this place fool you!!!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely slow, slow chefs, slow customer service, slow everything. The waiters aren't even that nice. When the place is super busy they will pack on the rice onto to your sushi, so you get full off of their rice instead of the fish. I've told my waiter I was unpleased with how they made it and asked for them to not do that. He came with another platter and it was made exactly the same. Nice.  I've been to MANY Spring Rolls locations, and it's always hit or miss, usually just MISS. I've been giving this place too many chances. Don't go here. You'll regret it. The decor is nice, but let me give you some advice. Run. There are so many other authentic sushi places in Toronto, trust me, this place isn't it."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of co-workers during lunchtime and we ended up spending over 2 hours here. We had the AYCE lunch, which was good. The dim sum was very tasty as well as the thai food. However, the service was sub-par. We ordered a couple of appetizers, and by the time the waiter came by the get our order for main dishes we were quite famished again. Not a great place for groups."}
{"text":"The food is not like it used to be. Very bad. Actually all the sauces tasted like no name sauce at the grocery store. That was my last time at Spring Rolls. Sad to say."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ventured over to Springs Rolls on Front street last Sunday. The location is amazing. There is a lovely patio with the Saint Lawrence Market building on one side, and the CN Tower and L Tower on the other side. It makes for a scenic view, especially for a foreigner like my boyfriend (all the way from Rochester)!  I had chosen what I was going to order, and my boyfriend had decided to go with the all-you-can-eat menu. The cutest little Asian waitress approached us and timidly asked if we were ready to order. Once we had ordered she informed us that we had to both order from the same menu, so I caved and went with the all-you-can-eat menu, internally resigning to the fact that I would probably leave feeling uncomfortably full.  My boyfriend almost seemed to treat it as a challenge as to how much he could physically eat. He began telling me about professional eaters who are paid to scarf down as much food as they possibly can in a certain amount of time. There seemed to be a glint in his eye as he told me this!   So then the eating began. We ordered veggie and chicken spring rolls, edamame, calamari, dragon rolls, chicken cashew pad thai all topped off with deep fried cheese cake.   Considering it was a buffet, the quality of the food was great. Usually buffets lack quality however this seemed to have it all. I would recommend this in a New York minute!"}
{"text":"I see a lot of negative reviews here from people who came to Spring Rolls expecting 100% true authentic Chinese food. I really have to wonder what they were thinking. If you are looking for the true authentic Chinese experience, there are other places to go. On the other hand if you less concerned about how your food is categorized and want an enjoyable dinner experience, this is a good place to eat.  Call it asian fusion, asian inspired, asian style, or whatever you like. Spring Rolls offers a huge variety of dishes. Some of their creations are more daring than others, but there's something for everyone's taste. The food is of excellent quality for the reasonable prices that they offer.    I also quite like the ambiance of the Front Street location. The patio is nice on a summer day."}
{"text":"The service is okay but the food is not worth the price. Very bland, and some Of it is just terrible. I got broccoli that was barley cooked and the meat was flavorless. Its not the first time spring rolls has disappointed me."}
{"text":"Not the best place for an \"Asian\" cuisine if you are Asian yourself. I feel like this is one of those restaurants that cater to white people as the food doesn't taste authentic.   My friend and I went for the all-you-can-eat dinner, which ranges from about $16.99 to $17.99 (depending on the day). Most of the dishes were OK, I didn't mind eating them but I didn't particularly enjoy it either. The best thing on the menu (at least to me and my friend) is their Siu Mai or Shumai -- however you want to say it. We also thoroughly enjoyed their dessert menu and ordered seconds, probably thirds.   It was OK, but we probably won't be coming back."}
{"text":"First of all, don't come here expecting authentic dishes. But Spring Rolls is a good option for getting Americanized-Asian food with a huge group of people since they have an assorted AYCE menu where there's always something for everyone!   There are some 'typical' Japanese, Korean, Chinese & Thai Asian dishes. After trying about quite a lot of their menu...here are my favourites: -Salt & pepper calamari  -Cheese dumplings  -Korean Kalbi beef -Mango salad -Salmon & Unagi sashimi  -Mango creme brûlée   I would stay away from their lamb chop, satay skewers, fried scallops, and sushi rolls next time. Their sushi rolls were below average because of the flavourless and dense rice."}
{"text":"I live the sit down buffet at this place. The food is made to order and off the regular menu. I particularly love the short ribs, mango tango chicken and mango salad. Their sushi is also very good. The service is also excellent. The servers are always fast and efficient."}
{"text":"This was probably one of the worst dining experiences I've had. The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because the food was good.   We were visiting Toronto for a long weekend and were enjoying the city quite a bit. My mom and little sister have Celiac's Disease, so it's tough to eat out. We found online that Spring Rolls offers gluten free options, so we decided to try it.   As soon as we told our server that we needed to hear the gluten free options, he had an attitude. He was so rude, non-attentive and short with us the entire time that it completely ruined our dining experience.   I'm writing this several days after our experience, and I'm still bothered by it. We were polite to him, and we received no respect in return.   Gr."}
{"text":"This place is always great food fusion asian food. I took my friend here to eat some good food in Toronto. We ordered several rounds of the lychee martini's. You definitely have to try them out. They were extremely delicious.   We also ordered the lunch special which I think was $13 or $14 each before tax. It came with an appetizer....I ordered the tempura rolls while he ordered the siu mai. It also came with a soup or salad. He chose the tom yum soup and I ordered the house salad. The house salad was luke warm and bland, but my friend said that the tom yum soup was delicious. Finally, I ordered the udon noodle soup while he ordered some salmon. I think the salmon dish he got was superior to the udon noodle soup.   We also noticed that they give 15% discounts to students. My friend was a graduate student and warned him to present the discount before all the drinks. Of course, he forgot to present it after a few drinks so heed my warning, show your student ID beforehand so you get the 15% discount."}
{"text":"The food is really salty. It was very disappointing. However the salmon sashimi was really good. The hostess when he greeted us didn't explain the different menus and neither did the server. They also have a seasonal menu that wasn't explained either.  I wouldn't rush to come back here. Overall very lackluster efforts by service and kitchen staff."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls are a bit pricey but everything was fresh, and the service was superb. All the servers were very friendly and refreshed our tea super fast. I'm excited to check out their AYCE Sushi Brush on Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Came in for chicken pad Thai, and red curry chicken. Both meals had lots of tofu substituted for the lack of chicken. I have had pad Thai many times and this is the first time I've had a pink/red pad Thai. I was told they use tomato & tamarind base to it. (Not very appealing to look at. The taste was there but not the appearance. The service was horrible here, we sat waiting for about 20 min searching for our waiter to get the check, our waiter vanished and another appeared. Very unorganized, the only plus was the decor was very nice and upscale."}
{"text":"Went here with some family while visiting in Toronto.  We managed to squeeze eight people into one of their large booths.  Our waitress wasn't very nice, but at least she got our orders right.  I had the rainbow roll and the regular kamakachi roll.  So good!  Nice presentation and the rolls stay together when you pick them up.  Everything tasted fresh and delicious.  My little cousin stayed entertained by watching the lights on the wall change colors.  It's quite nice inside and pretty laid back, but we were there rather early, say around 1:00 pm, for lunch."}
{"text":"I kinda like this franchise , decent quality for the price (all you can eat) but defiantly I would not recommend this location . Lack of management and horrible customer service is nothing new here. The staff are pretty rude and their behaviour is inappropriate. I noticed \"Very\" dirty and disgusting menu (oil and food stains all over the food menus) all the time and dirty tables. We had to go to this location for the second time since the other two locations ( @ sheppard centre & eglinton ) are both currently closed for the maintenance ,but today I promised myself that it was the very last time ."}
{"text":"Went to spring rolls with family and had the all you can eat special our servers name was Jeff Z and had HORRIBLE customer service skills took orders really quick without even letting us finish & when we had a small complaint about an item we ordered his response was ok and simply just that... after horrible service we refused to tip he than threw our bill on the table and began to tell other employees about us. Horrible experience don't think I'd come back to this location again!"}
{"text":"There is absolutely nothing bad or mediocre about my visit that I could've deducted my rating on.  My family came here for Spring Roll's AYCE dinner and mannn were we stuffed by the end of dinner. Surprisingly it wasn't busy on a Friday evening so we were seated right away. Our server was great throughout our visit and didn't forget any of our orders. Food didn't take very long to come out which is great when you're starving. We didn't opt for the premium menu because there was a handful of selections to choose from their regular menu anyways. Some of my favourite dishes were: the chicken pad thai, spider rolls, salmon sashimi, and the Yeung Chow fried rice.  Overall, great dining experience for an AYCE menu! I'd definitely go again."}
{"text":"The food is ok.  1st time I went I loved the inside, very nice atmosphere. I ordered one of the noodle dishes to go and some rolls. The food was ok. I went several more times trying different noodle dishes and apps but was never wowed.  One business lunch they ordered spring rolls. The sweet and sour chicken was good (how can anyone mess that up), the fried rice was burnt and the pad thai was bland.  In the end it's more style than substance. No more for me...."}
{"text":"I went there today with couple of friends. Nice atmosphere. Busy place obviously. We sat in a booth. Ordered Sushi ( green dragon, Boston something and Veggie explosion) the sushi pieces were big but delicious in addition to spicy eggplant with vegetables and Cashew nut chicken which was really good. Clean tables, nice waitress and in general it was a good experience. Worth mentioning that I managed to ruin my dinner by biting into a red chili pepper and burning my tongue beyond repair :( please don't do that!! .. Still alive though :) Enjoy."}
{"text":"if i could i would rate this a 0/5 this place really turned me off to asian fusion resturants. i would never go back.  the mixture of flavors are disgusting, even the drinks are disgusting  would not recommend"}
{"text":"Had dinner and did the all-you-can-eat since we were there when they were offering it. Do NOT order the pad thai.  Not sure what recipe they're using, but it's not pad thai.  It's just like sweet and sour sauce poured over some noodles.  The sashimi was wonderful, fish was fresh and the gyoza was so-so.  Service was good even though our waiter had so many tables it was ridiculous."}
{"text":"So our waiter today was not the greatest she at first seated us in a secluded area when window seats were open gave us chicken instead of tofu and did not get my coke untill the end"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend and I wasn't super impressed with the food. It was just mediocre at best. The service was mediocre too. Overall this place is extreme overpriced for what they offer. The pad Thai that I had was soupy and orange. No thanks!"}
{"text":"Just a quick review.  I have been to Spring Rolls in the past and had no issues at all.  Last Friday a group of co-workers and I ordered some food from Spring Rolls.  I was advised by a co-worker to not order the sushi.  I brushed off the warning, as I had never heard a complaint about Spring Rolls before.  Sushi arrived..  First of all, for 14.99, the portion was tiny tiny compared to other sushi options in the area.  The actual quality of the sushi left much to be desired, as none of my options tasted very good.  They weren't terrible, but definitely not good.  Tasted like it had been left out for a while.  This was the first time in my life, where I actually left some sushi behind as I didn't want risk eating any further.   Went down and got a slice of pizza (which I never do) because I was still hungry.  I don't want to knock the place for my one dish, but the sushi is not recommended."}
{"text":"I came to Spring Rolls with only one ambition in mind.... to tackle there AYCE Dim Sum Dinner Menu. Monday to Thursday it's $22.99 But Friday to Sunday it's $24.99   The AYCE menu includes basically almost everything that's on there regular menu: an array of soups, salads, dim sum, appetizers, Wok Dishes, Noodles, Rice, Curries, Sushi, Sashimi, & Handrolls. A very extensive menu indeed!  Since I came on a Tuesday I decided to upgrade to the Premium Menu...which is only $3.00 more and includes desserts and chef specials.  We were seated in a cozy booth in the corner. Our waiter took our drink orders Green tea of course and gave us time to look over the vast selection of goodies! Our waiter was very funny and attentive and gave us plenty of time between \"rounds\" of orders as he put it so we were able to pace ourselves quite nicely.  This is what we ordered that evening  Mango Salad - refreshing topped with roasted cashews Sea Salted Edamame - came out still steaming with the right amount of salt to bring out the flavour Siu Mai - juicy & plump served w/ a sriracha & mustard dipping sauce Crispy Wontons - basically deep fried siu mai Japanese Gyoza - pork filling Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura - Too oily Triple Cheese Dumplings - A must try! Basically a deep fried wonton with a cream cheese filling w/ raspberry jam for dipping really delicious combo 5/5  Spicy Salmon Roll -very slight amount of heat General Tao Chicken - my favourite chicken dish Kung Pao Chicken - another great chicken dish Malaysian Spicy Fried Rice - my favorite rice dish, good amount of heat!  Green Tea Ice Cream White Chocolate & Raspberry Cake - a bit too sweet for me Chocolate Mousse Cake - Creamy Chocolatey Goodness Red Velvet Cupcake - Soo moist w/ silky cream cheese icing and white chocolate curls 5/5 quite possibly one of the best cupcakes ever!  Overall a delicious coma inducing feast! Portion sizes of the dishes are the perfect size so you can sample many different things without being wasteful. Food comes out hot and quick so that you can finish eating your first round and then order your second round while giving you enough time to digest. Definitely pay the $3 bucks extra for the premium menu the desserts alone make it worth it!"}
{"text":"Came in here on a Saturday afternoon with one mission. To tackle the AYCE menu. Friday to Sunday the dinner AYCE is $22.99 but we decided to upgrade for a mere $3 more to the Premium Menu which includes some Chef Special items and desserts.  This is what we ended up ordering:  Mango Vegetable Salad - very refreshing, loved the ample roasted cashews Chicken Spring Rolls - Crunchy exterior flavourful interior Japanese Gyoza - Huge dumplings with a delicious juicy pork filling Spicy Salmon Handroll- was not a fan out this, found it too mushy and fishy tasting Sweet Potato Tempura - You can't wrong with sweet potato however I did find it really oily Thai Chicken Skewer with peanut sauce- the sauce I found to be too thick however the chicken skewer was cooked perfectly, just wished it was a bit more meaty Triple Cheese Dumplings -Love these deep fried wontons filled with salmon cream cheese I believe and served w/ raspberry jam for dipping really delicious combo Boston Lobster Tempura Roll- from the premium menu - loved the crunchy tempura outside and the creamy lobster avocado filling  Szechuan Beef -a little bit of heat with mixed veg and sauce  Famous Pad Thai - we asked for it to be very spicy and they definitely delivered, loved every bit from the saucy noodles to the tender strips of chicken and generous topping of crushed peanuts Malaysian Spicy Fried Rice - my favorite rice dish, good amount of heat!  New York Tempura Cheesecake-found it to be too oily and the coating could have been more crispy Green Tea Ice Cream- I'm always fan of this flavour! Yum! Coconut Ice cream- really enjoyed the bits of real coconut in this Chocolate Fudge Cupcake - very fudgey and rich chocolatey goodness Red Velvet Cupcake - Super moist topped with silky cream cheese icing and white chocolate curls, they got there cupcakes perfected  Overall I have to say Spring Rolls does a really satisfying AYCE menu. Everything came out piping hot and in a timely manner. The portion sizes are really good so you can order many things and not feel wasteful. The premium menu is definitely worth the extra $3 bucks for the desserts alone."}
